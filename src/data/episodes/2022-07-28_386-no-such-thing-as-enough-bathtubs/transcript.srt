00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,340
 Hi everybody, Andy here, just with a quick exciting announcement before this week's

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:09,560
 episode of Fish Begins, which is that we are going on tour.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:14,500
 If you haven't seen this already, we are heading around the entire UK and Ireland with

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,660
 our tour, Nerd Immunity.

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,380
 It's going to be so much fun, we're going to be stopping off all over the place.

6
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,820
 Think of a town near you, we're probably playing it.

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,300
 Names to stir the imagination, chill the blood.

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:31,800
 Things like Peterborough, Barnstable, Chesterfield, Birmingham, Ipswich, Canterbury.

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,820
 We're doing a whole raft in Scotland, we're doing Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness, Aberdeen.

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,960
 We're going to Cardiff, we're going to Belfast and Dublin.

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,860
 We're playing the London Palladium itself.

12
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,360
 We cannot wait.

13
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,080
 Every single show, we're going to be doing a brand new podcast in the second half and

14
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:52,540
 there will, as always, be a first half stuffed with stupidity, facts, us teasing down about

15
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,100
 the Mongolian death worm.

16
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,140
 You name it, it's going to be in the show.

17
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,180
 We cannot wait to be out there and we really hope to see you there.

18
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:03,900
 We know that it may feel strange being in a theatre, a room with actual other people,

19
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,300
 but we cannot wait and we're looking forward to it.

20
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:13,300
 So if you would like to come and see Nerd Immunity, all you have to do is go to qi.com/fishevents,

21
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,340
 see which is the nearest to you and snap up your ticket now.

22
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,340
 Alright, on with the show.

23
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:39,220
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

24
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:42,740
 to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

25
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:48,020
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting at a great distance from Anna Tyshinski, Andrew

26
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:53,260
 Hunter Murray and James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones with

27
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:59,580
 our four favourite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

28
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,480
 Starting with fact number one, that is Andy.

29
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:07,940
 My fact is that for the 1921 Buster Keaton film The Boat, two prop boats were built,

30
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,340
 one designed to float and one designed to sink.

31
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:15,100
 Unfortunately, the one meant to float persistently sank and the one designed to sink repeatedly

32
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,100
 stayed afloat.

33
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,140
 Okay, I have a question, why didn't they just relabel them?

34
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,300
 You know what, you would have been much use on this film, James, absolutely.

35
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,060
 It's so weird, it's such a weird story.

36
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,220
 This is from a book called Buster Keaton's Silent Shorts.

37
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:34,460
 The film is The Boat, there was a boat in it called Damfino and the movie's technical

38
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,700
 director was a guy called Fred Gabburi and he built two boats and there were different

39
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:43,460
 shots to be filmed basically and yeah, the one which was designed to sink, refused to

40
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,460
 sink.

41
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:48,780
 It was bored into it, it had a broken stern, deliberately broken stern and 1600 pounds of

42
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,140
 dead iron weight in it, it just would not sink, stayed afloat and the floater on the

43
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:57,060
 other hand just repeatedly sank and it had to be stuffed with pumps all the way through

44
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,380
 the bottom of it to keep it afloat.

45
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,780
 Has anyone seen The Boat?

46
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,660
 I haven't actually, Anna has.

47
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:05,300
 Yes, I have and it's dated, I will say it's dated.

48
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,300
 Oh really?

49
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,300
 Okay.

50
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,300
 Yeah, but it's perfectly good.

51
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,820
 I do think that it's probably pronounced Damfino, The Boat, although obviously you don't

52
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,100
 want to hear them say it, but there is.

53
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,500
 Did they rhyme it with Rhino halfway through the film in a note?

54
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,500
 Is that how you?

55
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,780
 It's really similar, at one point when they're sinking and they're about to drown, they call

56
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:28,780
 the coast guard and they say I'm on this boat and the coast guard says what's it called

57
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:36,260
 and they say Damfino and the coast guard mishears it as Damdefino and it's a hilarious exchange

58
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,260
 of misunderstanding.

59
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,260
 Very good.

60
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,420
 So back then that would have killed just because misunderstandings have been plowed

61
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:45,620
 to death in comedy since, you've got to put yourself a hundred years back and go wow that's

62
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,820
 the first misunderstanding that's ever happened.

63
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:51,780
 Do you remember that ever where I think it's for a beer?

64
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,460
 It's the sailors radioing into a coastal station or something and they're saying help, help

65
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:59,000
 we're sinking, we're sinking and it's a German guy on the receiving end and he says listen

66
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,660
 to this, we're sinking, we're sinking and he says yes, what are you thinking about?

67
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:06,580
 No, that's a good joke, that's a classic.

68
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,980
 So he's about how you deliver it, I'm just not sure they nailed the delivery in this.

69
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,180
 In the silent comedy.

70
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:19,340
 I watched another movie this week which was The General, which is one of his big ones.

71
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:24,460
 Although at the time it got very bad reviews because it's a movie where he plays someone

72
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:29,100
 in the south during the civil war and all the reviewers were from the north and they

73
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:34,740
 thought that he was kind of giving some kind of skewed version of history where actually

74
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,860
 the people who were in the south were heroes who were kind of a little bit misunderstood

75
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,780
 and maybe they should have won the war after all and stuff like that.

76
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,260
 But actually Buster Keaton, he was part of this kind of weird, I would say conspiracy

77
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:51,620
 but there was almost like a cult of people believing that the south was badly done to

78
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,620
 in the civil war.

79
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:57,140
 The story sounds really cool of the general because it's based on a true civil war story

80
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:01,820
 and the idea was there were Unionist spies in the south and they decided to basically

81
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:05,340
 hijack a train and this happens to the film right and the idea was they hijack a southern

82
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:11,020
 train and they take over it and then they speed it along towards Chattanooga which I like

83
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:15,020
 even though the Chattanooga choo choo is totally unrelated to this train but by coincidence

84
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,780
 speed it towards Chattanooga and it's like a reverse Wallace and Gromit because they're

85
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,220
 tearing up the rail and all the telegraph poles and stuff behind it, right?

86
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,660
 Every scene you look at it and you think this could be Wallace and Gromit.

87
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,660
 Yeah, all the way through.

88
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,660
 It's brilliant.

89
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,660
 It is amazing.

90
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,460
 There's the scene, one of Buster Keaton's most famous stunts is where there's a huge

91
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:37,300
 sleeper lying across the track, a huge log of wood basically and he's holding a huge

92
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,300
 sleeper in his hands.

93
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,860
 He's sitting on the cowcatcher at the front of the train and he has to throw a sleeper

94
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:47,300
 which is like tossing the caber basically at the other sleeper to knock it off the track.

95
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,300
 It's a real shot.

96
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,300
 The train is actually moving.

97
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,300
 Yeah, it's beautiful.

98
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,300
 And he manages it.

99
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,300
 Honestly, I watched it this week.

100
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:57,100
 It was made in 1927 and I didn't know it was going to happen and I just went, "Whoa!"

101
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,100
 Yeah.

102
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,100
 It's incredible.

103
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,500
 So that's the thing, like Buster Keaton, so he was part of that big movement of silent

104
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,660
 comedy that came out with Harold Lloyd and Charlie Chaplin.

105
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:12,340
 But this is a guy who, born in 1895, basically from the get-go, literally from birth, was

106
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,340
 into physical comedy.

107
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:17,100
 Literally from bungee out of the vagina.

108
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,100
 He basically did.

109
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:22,300
 I mean, his parents were both in Vorderville and he was on the side of the stage every

110
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,580
 single night, jumping in on their act and he used to go on stage and his parents just

111
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,180
 used to throw him across the stage.

112
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:34,180
 So he was known as the human mop, or Mr. Black and Blue, or the little boy who can't be damaged.

113
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,180
 People would be so concerned.

114
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:38,700
 It sounds like a misery memoir, title, "The Little Boy Who Can't Be Damaged".

115
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,700
 It really does.

116
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,700
 But in those days, it was entertainment.

117
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,220
 Well, there was a lot of questions about the fact of whether or not there was abuse from

118
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,700
 his dad as a result of this.

119
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,460
 He always claimed there never was, but a lot of people said, "Yeah, but come on, you were

120
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,220
 chucking your son around the stage."

121
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,460
 But he went on stage at the age of one day old.

122
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,460
 Yeah.

123
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,980
 Well, you both say, "Yeah, that was a story."

124
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:59,940
 There were lots of stories that they kind of put across because they were a mother and

125
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,180
 father and child sort of group of three.

126
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:08,220
 And there are lots of amazing stories about things that happened in their early days.

127
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,740
 I know the one that you're thinking of.

128
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:15,620
 Well, yeah, one for instance where he caught his forefinger in a clothes ringer, lost the

129
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:19,660
 first joint, then gashed his head near the eye with a brick that boomeranged after he

130
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:23,740
 threw it on a peach tree, and then, on the same day, he was sucked out of an upstairs

131
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:28,620
 window by a passing cyclone that carried him through the air and deposited him in the middle

132
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,220
 of the street a few blocks away.

133
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,220
 Yeah.

134
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,820
 And that was supposedly the story for why he started going on stage.

135
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,820
 It's mostly...

136
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,980
 And that's all one day, isn't it?

137
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:36,980
 That's all one day.

138
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,980
 It's in it.

139
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:38,980
 I've got his autobiography here.

140
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,660
 It's called My Wonderful World of Slapstick, and that is an entry in it.

141
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:45,780
 He said, "I had rolled and revolved about a block from the farmhouse when a man saw me,

142
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:50,020
 rushed out, scooped me up, and carried me to safety of the nearest storm cellar, a pretty

143
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:55,660
 strenuous day, as anyone will admit, but superb conditioning for my career as the human mop."

144
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:59,140
 So my question is, when you read that in someone's autobiography, do you think, "Well, it's

145
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:02,420
 in the autobiography, so it must be true," or do you think maybe the rest of the stuff

146
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,380
 in this autobiography isn't true?

147
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,380
 True.

148
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,380
 I believe it's all true.

149
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:09,140
 No, I think he was 20 months old, at that point, we should say.

150
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,140
 No, exactly.

151
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:13,980
 And there are stories, like he includes in this book that he was named Buster after he

152
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:18,140
 fell down a staircase, and Harry Houdini, who was in a partnership with his family, saw

153
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:24,240
 that and said - they named him Buster, basically, off the back of that - there's so much literature

154
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,740
 to say that that wasn't the case.

155
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,300
 I don't think the dates work out to them.

156
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,300
 Yeah, the dates weren't working.

157
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,300
 They were in a show with Houdini.

158
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,540
 Oh, they definitely were in a show with Houdini.

159
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,100
 And the thing is, is that he knew Houdini as he was growing up.

160
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,380
 There's stories in this book of him hanging out with him and going to shops and stuff when

161
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,060
 he was a bit older and when they could converse.

162
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:43,340
 So he claims it's true, but there was a newspaper report that claimed it was a guy called George

163
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:48,900
 Purdy, and that was published in Buster's early life, and so it predates it.

164
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,500
 And that's from his dad giving the story.

165
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,940
 If you've been in showbiz your whole life, then you're going to have a few little stories

166
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,940
 about you, aren't you?

167
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,940
 Exactly.

168
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,700
 But what's amazing is it turns out, from reading this book, that Buster Keaton is the

169
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,940
 Brian Blessed of American Hollywood.

170
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,820
 Every story is just unbelievable.

171
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:07,500
 I think that it looks like the best biography of him is by a woman called Marion Mead, who

172
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,340
 mainly I love it because I love her.

173
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,820
 She did a biography of Dorothy Parker that's amazing, but she had a lovely line, which

174
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:17,300
 was something like he layered the stories upon the myths of his life, like layers of

175
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,740
 a lasagna or something.

176
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,460
 But she did look into his life and looked into the stuff that happened at his early

177
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,500
 age, and it was very violent.

178
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:30,620
 So she said by age two, his brushes with death had included near incineration, suffocation,

179
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,460
 fools, mutilation, and natural calamities.

180
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:38,420
 And there was one time when his parents kept him in a suitcase backstage, and at one point

181
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:42,680
 a stagehand walked by, thought someone left that suitcase open, shot it, and they came

182
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,860
 out at the end of the night and found that he had almost suffocated.

183
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,300
 But he was fine.

184
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,380
 And then that suitcase kind of came in useful afterwards, didn't it?

185
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:55,020
 Because they took the handle and they put it on his back, attached it to his clothes,

186
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:59,940
 and they would hold onto the suitcase handle and throw him across the stage.

187
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:03,460
 They used to just, like the stunts, they'd throw him across the stage, they used to drop

188
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:08,020
 him into the orchestra pit when he was like two onto a bass drum.

189
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:12,180
 His dad once apparently threw him at a heckler, that was me.

190
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:17,580
 We're thinking about doing that to you on the next live tour, we all get together.

191
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:21,780
 But then the father would get arrested, according to Buster Keaton, he said they would get arrested

192
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:26,500
 every other week, or rather his old man would get arrested, and the police would basically

193
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,540
 come over and say, why are you abusing your son?

194
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:33,140
 And then they would kind of look at Buster Keaton and see if he had all bruises and stuff,

195
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,540
 and he didn't, apparently, because he could fall so well, and so they kind of let them

196
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,540
 off every time.

197
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:42,900
 It's weird when you read about him, because you find yourself on the side of Buster Keaton

198
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:49,260
 against the first ever child protective agency, because, and you wonder if you're reading

199
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:53,660
 it right, it was the Jerry Society, it was the first ever protection of children organisation

200
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:57,700
 in the world, it had just been set up, and it was chasing down these people, it did seem

201
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:02,500
 like we're abusing their son, but he remembers them as complete bogeymen.

202
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,520
 And the thing about them that's kind of interesting is they were set up by Elbridge Jerry, who

203
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:12,900
 was the grandson of Vice President Elbridge Jerry, from where we get the word, Jerry

204
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,900
 Mandarin.

205
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,900
 Really?

206
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,340
 Yeah, he's the guy who first fingered around with the districts.

207
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:21,300
 Oh, I was about to ask what that means, but I understand now.

208
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,300
 How rude.

209
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:27,260
 It's where they change the shape of the districts to mean that you're voters in a place where

210
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,020
 you want them to be.

211
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:34,260
 But another interesting thing about the Jerry Society is that they were started when there

212
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:39,760
 was a church worker called Etta Agnal Wheeler, and she'd noticed that a child was being mistreated,

213
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,120
 and she wanted to try and get someone to help this child, but there was no one to help them.

214
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,360
 And she realised that there was no charity that was there to look after children.

215
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,760
 But there was an American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and she's

216
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:57,360
 like, how can we have a charity for cruelty to animals, but not cruelty to children?

217
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,320
 And so she went to the person who was in charge of the American Society for the Prevention

218
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,540
 of Cruelty to Animals, and said, why don't you set up a children's charity?

219
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,540
 And that's what they did.

220
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,100
 So actually, the children's charity grew from the animals charity.

221
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,100
 Really?

222
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:16,380
 I thought you were going to say they reclassified children as animals for the benefit of them.

223
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,940
 They got some protection.

224
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:23,140
 You know the really famous, the really, really, really famous stunt is where the house falls

225
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:29,180
 on him, around him, and there's a window which falls exactly in the right place that it lands

226
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,180
 around him.

227
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,440
 So you get two inches of clearance on either side of him for that stunt.

228
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,440
 It's just incredible.

229
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,320
 I can't believe they made it work.

230
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,320
 And he supposedly was nailed to the ground.

231
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,320
 I can't quite believe that.

232
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,080
 He was nailed to the ground.

233
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,760
 His shoes were nailed to the ground to keep him exactly on the right mark.

234
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,760
 Oh, right.

235
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,520
 So that's where the window's going to fall.

236
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,600
 I watched that scene yesterday, and I'm sure he walked away.

237
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,600
 The shot changes.

238
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,240
 I believe the shot changes, and then he leaves.

239
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,520
 But maybe, I mean, possibly it doesn't, and I'm wrong.

240
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,520
 That's also, yeah.

241
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,160
 No, I think you would go with nailing to the ground, because you can't look up and

242
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,900
 check, because otherwise, that ruins the scene.

243
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,740
 I wouldn't want to be nailed to the ground if they're going to drop the house, as in,

244
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,740
 you might think--

245
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,460
 Once it hits you, there's not much you can do about it.

246
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,460
 Yeah, that's true.

247
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:10,140
 Surely you'd want to be nailed to the ground rather than risk getting your boots on, and

248
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,140
 then thinking, oh, good.

249
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:16,460
 Did I just accidentally step to the left of it?

250
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:20,700
 So he was very, very successful for a very long time, had a lot of money, and he used

251
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,620
 to invest in real estate and so on.

252
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:27,820
 And one of the things he invested in was a yacht, and he was very proud of this yacht.

253
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:31,560
 And one day, he was going through troubles in his marriage.

254
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,280
 He went to take his yacht out, and--

255
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:38,760
 He tried to sink it to end it all, but unfortunately, he was using the damn final.

256
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:44,360
 No, he went to try and take the yacht out, and the sort of boat master or the person

257
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,880
 who sort of looks after it said, I'm sorry, you can't.

258
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,120
 It's only your wife who can take it out, and she's told me not to let you.

259
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,640
 And he suddenly discovered that their marriage had fallen apart, and they were getting basically

260
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,640
 a divorce.

261
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,840
 So he lost his yacht.

262
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:01,500
 So in retaliation, he bought himself what he called the land yacht.

263
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,500
 Do you guys read about the land yacht?

264
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,500
 No.

265
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,060
 I read a one-line reference to it, but I didn't find it anymore.

266
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,060
 Yeah, yeah.

267
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,060
 So I read into it.

268
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:10,580
 So he bought a land yacht, which basically he dressed as a captain, and he used to drive

269
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:15,580
 around, and he would go to all sorts of-- like he would go to hotels, and he'd make a scene

270
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,580
 of it by saying, we're going to rent out a room, but actually, we're just going to rent

271
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,460
 out a car park space, and we'll stay in our land yacht.

272
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,460
 Is it like a big sort of vehicle that looks like a yacht?

273
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,460
 Yeah.

274
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:30,600
 It's like a big bus that had been converted into what was known as a land yacht.

275
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,040
 It does sound awesome on one level, but on the other, he is after divorce sleeping in

276
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,040
 his car.

277
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,720
 Like there are two ways of looking at the situation.

278
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,640
 He did say, I had as much fun with my land yacht as a man can whose purpose is to forget

279
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,800
 his whole private world has fallen apart.

280
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,800
 So yeah.

281
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,800
 It was not a good time for him.

282
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,440
 But then he ended up in a sanitarium, didn't he?

283
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,440
 Yeah.

284
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,440
 And he was in a straitjacket.

285
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,520
 But unfortunately, it's very hard to keep someone in a straitjacket if they're friends

286
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:57,340
 with Harry Houdini, so he just got him straight out.

287
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,340
 Yeah.

288
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,340
 Was he really in a straitjacket?

289
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,340
 Yeah.

290
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,340
 Yeah.

291
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:05,940
 And the Harry Houdini thing is, I think, falls into the Buster Keaton myth or no, the great

292
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,940
 tales.

293
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:10,740
 But he ran away, didn't he, and he got married to the nurse who was looking after him at

294
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,740
 the time.

295
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,620
 While he was still married to the original life.

296
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,620
 Yes.

297
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,620
 Really?

298
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,620
 Yeah.

299
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,620
 I mean, he was very drunk all the way through this time.

300
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,620
 Well, that's fair enough.

301
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,780
 He might have said, that was very big of me.

302
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,780
 Yeah.

303
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,780
 Yeah.

304
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:27,080
 That'd be another one of those mishearing jokes.

305
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,640
 That would have worked brilliantly on a silent film.

306
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:34,160
 In his later years, he mostly did TV adverts and his grandchildren didn't know him from

307
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,160
 any of his films.

308
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,160
 They knew him as the singing puppet advertising Alka-Seltzer on TV.

309
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,160
 Really?

310
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,160
 Yeah.

311
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,160
 Wow.

312
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,160
 But he loved it.

313
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,160
 He would turn up and do the adverts and then go away again.

314
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,540
 And other silent stars like Charlie Chaplin, I don't think, did Telly.

315
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,540
 They thought it was beneath them.

316
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,540
 They hated Telly.

317
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,540
 Yeah.

318
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:53,660
 They hated Limelight, which is one of the great silent comedy scenes because it's in

319
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:57,400
 the talkies at this point and it's two old men, Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, coming

320
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,100
 together to do a routine on a Vorderville stage.

321
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:04,040
 And it's just such a beautiful moment because Buster Keaton still wasn't making movies

322
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:09,140
 and Chaplin gave him this moment again to sort of shine, which was really, really wonderful.

323
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:13,660
 Because Chaplin, I think, also felt like all of those silent stars, they sort of became

324
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:17,900
 much less famous very, very quickly during the talkies and then had his big renaissance.

325
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,600
 So he did get Buster Keaton to have a slightly happy ending.

326
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,460
 He got an honorary Oscar in the late fifties, I think, and all of his films were re-shown

327
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,820
 in the fifties and sixties and film buffs were suddenly like, "This is genius."

328
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:32,300
 And Chaplin as well got, I think he was put up for an honorary Oscar in seventies, in

329
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,300
 the early seventies.

330
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,300
 Yeah.

331
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,820
 And when he was told about that, he said, "God, does anyone even remember who I am?"

332
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,820
 Wow.

333
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,980
 Well, because he'd been exiled to Sweden or somewhere like that.

334
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,980
 Exiled.

335
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:42,980
 Yeah.

336
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:43,980
 He got kicked out of America.

337
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:44,980
 Chaplin had a huge period for--

338
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:45,980
 What for?

339
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:46,980
 Being a communist.

340
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:47,980
 Yeah.

341
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,140
 I think he left on a holiday and was told he couldn't come back.

342
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:53,100
 Wait, what's black and white and red all over?

343
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,100
 Charlie Chaplin.

344
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,100
 Charlie Chaplin.

345
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,100
 Very good.

346
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,100
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

347
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,100
 I'll buy that.

348
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,100
 That's great.

349
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:07,380
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Anna.

350
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:12,860
 My fact this week is that in 1993, America learned that Kazakhstan had enough uranium

351
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:19,700
 to make 24 nuclear bombs when a U.S. diplomat's car mechanic tried to sell it all to him.

352
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,660
 Oh my God.

353
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,660
 It's very cool.

354
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:25,860
 It's like, you know, you get your car done and they're always like, "What do you want

355
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:28,660
 your wheel trims doing or do you want this doing?"

356
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,660
 It's upselling.

357
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,660
 Yeah.

358
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,660
 It's major upselling.

359
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,660
 And he bought it as well.

360
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:38,940
 So this was a guy called Andy Weber and he was sort of in charge of defense and nuclear

361
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:43,580
 programs under Obama, but in the 80s he was working at the U.S. Embassy in Kazakhstan

362
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:48,020
 and his car mechanic, who was also kind of a fixer and all-round wheeler dealer kind

363
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:52,660
 of guy, basically said to him, "Do you fancy some uranium?"

364
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:56,220
 And so this guy called the U.S. government and said, "Look, this bloke's just offered

365
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,900
 me a bunch of uranium," and they didn't believe him.

366
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:02,780
 But eventually he had a series of meetings and was set up with other people to lead him

367
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:08,220
 to the uranium and he met with this general, this Kazakh general, who just slipped him

368
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:14,500
 a bit of paper, which said, "U-235," as in the uranium that can make a nuclear bomb,

369
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,020
 "90% 600 kilos."

370
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:22,380
 So for comparison, the Hiroshima bomb used 64 kilos of 80% in rich uranium.

371
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,380
 Okay.

372
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,660
 It was hardcore stuff.

373
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,740
 And so what did he do with this uranium when he bought it?

374
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,300
 Just kept in his back pocket, useful for any day.

375
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:34,500
 No, he told the U.S. government and they chatted to the president of Kazakhstan and they agreed

376
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,140
 that the U.S. should take it in case Iran got it, basically.

377
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,940
 Same old fears.

378
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:43,180
 And so he was taken to it and shown it and it sounds incredible.

379
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:48,860
 He went to this warehouse, basically, and he found it all in buckets and the buckets

380
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,460
 were spaced apart.

381
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,620
 So they were on this big table and they were spaced apart because if you have uranium too

382
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:57,780
 close together when it's that highly enriched, it does create a massive nuclear explosion.

383
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,460
 So it literally spaced apart to avoid criticality issues.

384
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,460
 Oh my God.

385
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,460
 Isn't that terrifying?

386
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,580
 What if you've got a small table?

387
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,940
 He did specify it was a very big table.

388
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,940
 It must have been a very big table.

389
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,740
 So it's on the key lines in buckets.

390
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,740
 Yeah.

391
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,740
 It's quite heavy, I think.

392
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,740
 Maybe they had a few trestle tables.

393
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,740
 That kind of thing.

394
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,940
 No, they probably set up some, yeah, trestles.

395
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:15,940
 Yeah.

396
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,940
 Yeah.

397
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:17,940
 Pushed on together.

398
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,620
 The extraction process was pretty amazing.

399
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,500
 You had to carry it in a really large plane.

400
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,900
 So it was some of the largest planes in the world that were sent over from America to

401
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,580
 Kazakhstan to pick it up.

402
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,580
 There was a tiny...

403
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,580
 Is that because it has to be kept at a certain distance from itself?

404
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,580
 I think it has to be kept at a distance.

405
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,580
 Yeah.

406
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,580
 And I think there are actually four planes.

407
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,580
 It's a big table.

408
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:39,140
 Now you can now turn down your in-flight tables.

409
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,780
 Why not just take them in separate?

410
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,280
 Like do a bunch of trips?

411
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,780
 Why are we getting too close to each other?

412
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:46,260
 Well, obviously, more likely of problems if you take them on loads of flights.

413
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,780
 If you take them on one flight, hopefully nothing goes wrong.

414
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,780
 It's like that old saying.

415
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:52,780
 Put all your eggs in one basket.

416
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,780
 Yeah.

417
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,780
 There was four baskets.

418
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:59,020
 It was all your uranium and it was four baskets/planes and then they weren't allowed to fly over

419
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:02,980
 any countries because basically they're carrying this massive nuclear bomb.

420
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:05,660
 I think Kazakhstan is landlocked.

421
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:09,900
 So yeah, they had to get to the nearest sea possible so they had to literally jump from

422
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:15,700
 like Caspian Sea over hardly any land and because of that, it ended up being the longest

423
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:20,380
 flight ever that the US had done and they had to do loads of in-flight refuelling because

424
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:23,020
 obviously they didn't have enough fuel to do this massively long flight so they were

425
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,660
 taking such a roundabout route.

426
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,300
 But for four planes?

427
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,300
 For four planes, yeah.

428
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,300
 Oh, my God.

429
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,300
 What a nightmare.

430
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,300
 Yeah.

431
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,300
 Hell.

432
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,780
 That's a nightmare situation.

433
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,820
 You wouldn't want to be project manager on that, obviously.

434
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:36,820
 Obviously.

435
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,820
 Yeah.

436
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,220
 It's not a very can-do attitude that I'm the idol, please.

437
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:43,380
 What you really need to be doing is, "Okay, guys, this is what we're going to do now."

438
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,220
 Oh, God, this sounds hard, doesn't it?

439
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,220
 It's all my hassle.

440
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:49,780
 That's why I'm a podcasting and not in nuclear material, that's my hassle.

441
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:54,300
 Have you guys heard about the missing Nazi uranium cubes?

442
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,300
 No.

443
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,300
 This is amazingly cool.

444
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,300
 That's like an Indiana Jones fly.

445
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,300
 It genuinely is.

446
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,300
 It's amazing.

447
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,380
 We've been working on nuclear fission in the late 1930s.

448
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,220
 Lots of people were working on it at the time, obviously, because it would have been a big

449
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,220
 advantage.

450
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:10,980
 The German scientists made this really weird cube nuclear reactor, which was 664 cubes

451
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:15,100
 of uranium all hanging up near each other, I guess, from the kind of reaction that Anna

452
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,100
 was talking about.

453
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:21,660
 It was not a proper reactor in the way that we'd understand it, but it was all uranium.

454
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:25,620
 When the Allies invaded, they took the cubes, which the German scientists as they left had

455
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:28,380
 tried to hide by burying in a field.

456
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:32,320
 The Allies had to dig up these cubes and take them away, and it was a chaotic attempt to

457
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,820
 get hold of them.

458
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:37,980
 In April 1945, there was a retreating military truck with the cubes on them, and a bunch

459
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:43,980
 of boys in a town called Garmisch-Partenkirchen, they nicked a load of the cubes and discovered

460
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,500
 that when you threw them, they would spark when they hit the ground.

461
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,380
 They just were chucking around uranium.

462
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,380
 You know what?

463
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,380
 I've been to Garmisch-Partenkirchen.

464
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,380
 Have you?

465
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,380
 Yeah, I have.

466
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:57,300
 When we went there, it was Christmas time, and there was a big marketplace, and there

467
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,700
 were a load of kids, and they had these little cap things, and they kept throwing them on

468
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,700
 the floor genuinely.

469
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,700
 That was happening.

470
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,700
 No way!

471
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,700
 Yeah, yeah.

472
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,700
 That's really, that's bizarre.

473
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,020
 You probably should have confiscated those.

474
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,500
 But lots of them are missing now.

475
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,140
 I think I do suspect there is loads of this stuff still lying around, even though everyone

476
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:17,020
 claims weapons inspectors blah, blah, blah, they've sorted it out.

477
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,820
 I mean, there's no way.

478
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:23,340
 Hands, blicks, his ears, they keep coming around now.

479
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,580
 Get back on it, blicks.

480
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,580
 What are you doing?

481
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:29,820
 In the 90s, there were US inspectors in Russia who were basically saying Russia was full

482
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,540
 of these warehouses that had little bits of uranium in them.

483
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:38,220
 He said there was one warehouse stuffed with very highly enriched uranium, and it was locked

484
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:43,780
 with a bit of rope and a wax seal, which I've opened wax seals on the occasional fashion

485
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,780
 letter.

486
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,780
 And it's not difficult.

487
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,900
 That's really raising a few more questions than it's answered.

488
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,860
 Who's sending you wax sealed letters, Emma?

489
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,380
 I exchanged letters with past.

490
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:56,860
 Are you going out with a count from the 17th century or something?

491
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,380
 We send wax seal.

492
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,380
 Do you?

493
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,380
 Yeah, we do, yeah.

494
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,860
 Alina uses wax seal a lot.

495
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:02,860
 Really?

496
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:03,860
 Yeah.

497
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,860
 James and I always correspond that way.

498
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:05,860
 That's why we find that when the podcast.

499
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,780
 He has to write to me.

500
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,140
 What does she use them for?

501
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:11,060
 Just kind of cool, like cool seal.

502
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,220
 Well, she just thinks it's cool and Instagram-y.

503
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:16,380
 So do you have your own, like, harken seal that goes on it?

504
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,380
 I can't remember.

505
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,740
 She has her own seal, but I don't think it's a harken seal.

506
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,740
 Right.

507
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,740
 Yeah.

508
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,740
 That's very cool.

509
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,160
 We did it with you because it was all paper trail, wasn't it, back then, and we've lost

510
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,160
 the paper.

511
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,160
 We don't know where stuff is.

512
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,380
 50% of this podcast use wax seals.

513
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,700
 That should be the headline fact.

514
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:35,460
 It's got to be unproportional, and it's not you.

515
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,340
 I mean, that's insane.

516
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:43,940
 Yeah, but like Dan says, it was kind of paper trails, and they basically relied on, they

517
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,140
 just had fences.

518
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,380
 They had ropes.

519
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:51,140
 They might have had the odd wax seal, but mostly it was just intimidation that stopped

520
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,500
 people from stealing this stuff.

521
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:56,180
 It was basically like, with a secret police, you better not steal it because you know what

522
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,180
 will happen.

523
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:01,020
 And that's basically their only kind of way of stopping people from stealing stuff.

524
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:05,580
 But the problem was that if you lost any uranium, you're getting so much trouble, people just

525
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,920
 kept it off the books.

526
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:11,020
 And so that's the reason we don't really know how much of anything there was.

527
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,020
 Interesting.

528
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,020
 Yeah.

529
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,980
 Yeah, you wouldn't want to be reporting that back to Stalin, would you?

530
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:15,980
 No, no.

531
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,980
 Of course not.

532
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:17,980
 I've lost a bomb.

533
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:23,180
 And third nuclear power, and you don't hear that much about us, do you?

534
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:28,940
 And also in this year, the UK has raised the number of nukes that we have, which didn't

535
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:35,300
 get in the news that much, but we've gone up from the previous cap of 225, our cap is

536
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,740
 now 260.

537
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:41,340
 So in a world where like ostensibly at least we're saying, let's get rid of all the nuclear

538
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:45,140
 weapons, I think there's a lot of re-arming happening around the world at the moment.

539
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,140
 That's very interesting.

540
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:49,520
 It doesn't feel like those extra 45 are going to make all the difference in one way or the

541
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,520
 other.

542
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,520
 No.

543
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:56,620
 If you can think of 220 places to attack and you still want 45 more, I don't know.

544
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,180
 I mean, it's not your priority there.

545
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:02,100
 Like because what, America and Russia are going to have what, about 6,000 each, 10,000

546
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,100
 each, something like that.

547
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:08,460
 So our extra 40 might make all the difference in that war.

548
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,860
 40 more than Australia have.

549
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:14,300
 I think, you know, it's not necessarily, you don't have to go fighting the big boys.

550
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,180
 Well, I think that the idea is not to fight anyone.

551
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,180
 I think the idea is...

552
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,180
 Fight.

553
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,180
 Fight.

554
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,180
 Fight.

555
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,180
 Please God, no.

556
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,460
 I think most people think the idea is a deterrent.

557
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,460
 Yeah.

558
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:27,460
 I think welcome to the very confusing Cold War philosophy of mutually assured destruction,

559
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:32,340
 which obviously didn't make any sense at all, but yeah, we've got enough to destroy the

560
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,340
 universe.

561
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:36,580
 But 17% of British electricity comes from nuclear sources.

562
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,580
 17%?

563
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,580
 I say, well done.

564
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,580
 You know?

565
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,580
 The positive spin.

566
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,580
 Yeah, me too.

567
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,580
 I mean, not weapons grade though.

568
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,580
 Not weapons grade.

569
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,580
 I don't know.

570
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:50,460
 But Sellefield, nuclear power station, is obviously one of the places where it's generated.

571
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,620
 And Sellefield's a really interesting place.

572
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,620
 They have their own magazine, which I didn't know.

573
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,620
 How interesting.

574
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:59,860
 How often is that issued?

575
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:03,000
 That's not a weekly magazine, is it?

576
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,860
 It is weekly, but every week there are half as many pages as in the previous week.

577
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:12,060
 But that's not all that Sellefield has, Dan, because I sense you're being skeptical that

578
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,060
 that's the most interesting thing.

579
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,060
 I'm just surprised you opened it.

580
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,060
 What's coming next?

581
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:23,020
 Well, they've got a freezer full of dead seagulls, which is cool, because any mammal that dies

582
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,300
 in Sellefield, that's our mammals.

583
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,300
 No.

584
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,300
 No.

585
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,300
 All right.

586
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,300
 That's a free seagull.

587
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:35,460
 If animals go into Sellefield and they get too close to the nuclear stuff, then they

588
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:39,020
 are considered hazardous, radioactively hazardous.

589
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:42,380
 And so that can be a gateway to poison the wider area, because obviously you've got these

590
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:45,240
 radioactive seagulls flying off, creating mayhem.

591
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,460
 So they're considered putrescent nuclear waste.

592
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,460
 This was reported in 2010.

593
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,700
 They had 350 birds and small mammals in their freezers.

594
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,700
 That's quite a big freezer.

595
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,700
 Yeah, it is.

596
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,300
 They'll keep you going in a lockdown.

597
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,300
 Yeah.

598
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,500
 It's quite a big freezer, that's what I was saying.

599
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:02,500
 That's the most interesting fact about that story.

600
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,500
 Picture the freezer.

601
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,780
 You didn't want me to be interested in project management before.

602
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:12,380
 Yeah, what I showed interest in freezer capacity.

603
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:18,420
 Just on nuclear bombs and the hazards of them, America seems to be a bit clumsy with those

604
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,420
 sometime.

605
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:23,900
 We've read a few stories where you think, Jesus, you guys got lucky there, really.

606
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:30,700
 So in 1961, there was a plane, and it had a mid-flight situation where all the pilots

607
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:35,500
 had to jump out of the plane, evacuate ejector seat out of it, and the plane actually crumbled

608
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:40,900
 in the air, and two nuclear bombs dropped from it over North Carolina.

609
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:44,980
 And they should have gone off, basically, but they found one of the bombs hanging from

610
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:50,300
 a parachute off a tree, and they looked at it, and basically, for this bomb to go off,

611
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,620
 four things needed to be activated on it.

612
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,340
 So it's a four-tier system.

613
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:58,340
 Three of those had been activated in the process of it going down, but the fourth didn't go

614
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,980
 off for some reason.

615
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,780
 As none of them should have gone off, should they?

616
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:06,660
 And yet, somehow, three of these extreme safety triggers had just gone off.

617
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,660
 Yeah, we're ready to go.

618
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,700
 That's why you have four, I guess.

619
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,180
 Oh, my God.

620
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:17,460
 But if it went off, each of them had 253 times the power that the little boy bomb had that

621
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,460
 was dropped over Hiroshima.

622
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,460
 Can you imagine?

623
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,100
 Just one thing didn't go off.

624
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,340
 Is kind of mind-boggling.

625
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:29,420
 We had one in Britain as well in the '50s, didn't we, in Lake and Heath Air Base in Suffolk.

626
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:33,460
 That was a plane crashed into a nuclear weapons storage facility.

627
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:37,940
 It was a miracle that the bombs didn't explode, but if they had, we probably would have lost

628
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:38,940
 Cambridge.

629
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,940
 Wow.

630
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:40,940
 It was an US official.

631
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:41,940
 Was an Oxford boy?

632
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,940
 A handy-looking happy?

633
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:45,940
 No great loss.

634
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:50,980
 One US official said it's possible that part of Eastern England would have become a desert.

635
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,980
 Wow.

636
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,020
 And we only found out about this way, way later.

637
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:58,780
 But when we look back, the reports said that there was a mass panic when they realized this

638
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,780
 has happened.

639
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:04,260
 And when the fire services were going towards Lake and Heath, all they saw was a convoy

640
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:07,620
 of Americans just legging it out.

641
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:12,580
 Just cars full of people just panicking and people getting taxis and just saying, "Take

642
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:15,660
 me anywhere away from here as quickly as you can."

643
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,860
 Would you take on that taxi ride as a cab driver?

644
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:21,500
 I think I'd say, do you know what, you're a little bit out of my zone, actually.

645
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,940
 I think I might put a search charge on for sure.

646
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:25,940
 Gosh.

647
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,260
 It is just unbelievable nothing ever happened.

648
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,700
 My God, we got lucky.

649
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,060
 There's so many cock-ups.

650
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:36,540
 In 1983, there was this other one, which was when in the Soviet Union, there was a computer

651
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:41,340
 malfunction, which meant that the guy on duty, Stanislav Petrov, basically received information

652
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:45,100
 that the US was launching a missile strike on the USSR at that very moment.

653
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:49,180
 And he was under very strict orders that he should tell his superiors and they would launch

654
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,460
 a retaliatory nuclear strike.

655
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:55,140
 And so he watched the siren go off and go like, "Strike, strike, strike."

656
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,780
 And it said, "This is actually 100% reliable information we've got.

657
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:01,980
 A second siren, a third, a fourth, a fifth went off."

658
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:06,540
 And he, for some reason, decided not to tell his superiors, thought, "Do you know what?

659
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,300
 I think that something's gone wrong here."

660
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:12,980
 And he said the only reason he thought that was because the system was too certain.

661
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:19,820
 And he thought it had to pass 28 or 29 security levels to be totally sure that there was a

662
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,820
 strike.

663
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,100
 And he was like, "I'm not even sure it would do that if there was a strike."

664
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:26,860
 So he didn't report it, 20 minutes went by, nothing happened.

665
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,340
 So he thought, "Okay, it was a computer cock up."

666
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,580
 But he was the only civilian person who was...

667
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:34,580
 That's a stressful 20 minutes.

668
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:44,540
 Not even the best episode of Frazier could take your mind off that.

669
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:47,780
 Okay, it's time for fact number three and that is James.

670
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:53,380
 Okay, my fact this week is that frog hopper insects can shoot their urine away from their

671
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:57,240
 body 20 times their own body length.

672
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:01,420
 If they didn't do that, they'd probably drown in their own piss.

673
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:06,520
 Well, good for them that they developed this.

674
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,860
 Bad for frog hopper toilet makers, I guess.

675
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:09,860
 Yeah.

676
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:10,860
 20 times is quite far, though.

677
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,860
 So...

678
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:12,860
 Quite.

679
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:13,860
 Yeah, give us more.

680
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,860
 How would that work?

681
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:15,860
 120 feet.

682
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:16,860
 For us.

683
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:17,860
 Yeah.

684
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:21,500
 So you must be pissing a hell of a lot for it to stack up enough that it could drown

685
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,500
 in their own body.

686
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,600
 Well, they all make really, really good points.

687
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:29,980
 So this was an article that I read recently on iflscience.com and it was about frog hoppers

688
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:37,100
 and what they do is they drink sap from trees, but they drink xylem, whereas most insects

689
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,380
 drink phloem.

690
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:41,940
 So phloem's got loads of sugar, really easy to get to for some reason.

691
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:46,220
 They drink xylem, which is really hard to get to and has very little nutrition.

692
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:50,340
 Because it has so little nutrition, they have to drink tons and tons and tons and tons of

693
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,340
 it.

694
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:55,420
 And I don't need to tell you that if you drink lots and lots of stuff, you need to pee a lot.

695
00:31:55,420 --> 00:32:01,220
 So they create loads and loads of urine and really they piss pretty much all the time.

696
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:06,220
 And if they didn't get rid of it somehow, it's going to get in the throat if they had

697
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,220
 a throat.

698
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,220
 Do they have a throat?

699
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,700
 Let's not discuss whether they have throats on that.

700
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:17,580
 Anyway, so what they've come up with is a bum-mounted catapult, and what happens is they can urinate

701
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:24,620
 out of their bodies and this catapult fires the liquid away about 10 centimetres away,

702
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:28,420
 which might not sound that far, but they're only about 5 millimetres in length.

703
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,420
 So cool.

704
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:35,820
 But if you're parked at that exact distance from another of these frog hoppers, it's effectively

705
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,820
 a war, isn't it?

706
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:39,420
 You're sort of drowning each other in battle.

707
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,420
 What would you do?

708
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,420
 I guess you would.

709
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,420
 Yeah.

710
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,420
 I mean, you'd move.

711
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,420
 You'd step to the side.

712
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,420
 Yeah.

713
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,420
 Yeah, solve that.

714
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:49,340
 And they're having to go to all of this effort, I think, just because they didn't pay attention

715
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:53,660
 in GCSE biology, the xylem carries the water, the phloem carries the sugars.

716
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,660
 You idiots.

717
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,660
 Exactly.

718
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,660
 Exactly.

719
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,660
 I mean, why are they doing it?

720
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:01,260
 But the amount of urine that they produce, particularly when they're babies, they're

721
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:07,060
 nymphs, they produce between 150 and 280 times their own body weight in urine every single

722
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,340
 day.

723
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,340
 Every single day.

724
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,340
 So great.

725
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,340
 It's nuts.

726
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,900
 So I was talking to Ethan, one of the elves about it.

727
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:17,180
 So I weigh roughly 80 kilograms, roughly that.

728
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:22,900
 So that would be me producing 22,400 litres of urine a day.

729
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:23,900
 That's what they do.

730
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,460
 So basically 74 bathtubs worth of urine.

731
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,460
 Wow.

732
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,460
 Is that full baths?

733
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,460
 Full baths.

734
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,460
 Yeah.

735
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,460
 Gosh.

736
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,460
 74 bathtubs full of urine.

737
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,460
 An arresting image.

738
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,460
 It is.

739
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,960
 Where do you get that many bathtubs?

740
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,180
 You'd have to go to a showroom.

741
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:40,940
 You'd have to go to John Lewis and they won't be happy about it.

742
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,180
 I see you coming.

743
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,180
 Oh no.

744
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,180
 Here's Dan.

745
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:47,180
 Here's Pissy Shriver.

746
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,780
 Oh, frog coppers.

747
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,780
 Frog coppers are amazing.

748
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,780
 They're amazing.

749
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:55,060
 Like Hannah said, they're stupid because they suck out xylem, which is really hard

750
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,060
 to suck out.

751
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,620
 It's not only got no nutrition, it's really hard to suck out.

752
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,300
 So it means they have to be really, really good at sucking.

753
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,300
 Oh yeah.

754
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:05,940
 They've got record breaking sucking powers, haven't they?

755
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,180
 They are suckers in nature.

756
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:10,820
 I think 80 times more powerful than an elephant sucks, I think.

757
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:11,820
 I mean, yeah.

758
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,660
 They're incredible jumpers as well.

759
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,140
 Their jumping is extraordinary.

760
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:20,220
 So they can get to the heights of 70 centimetres and they're only six millimetres long.

761
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:22,260
 So that's a huge jump.

762
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:27,180
 And what's amazing is that they use their back legs in order to do the jumping.

763
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:30,300
 But the back legs are basically specialised to be used for that.

764
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:33,580
 So when they're walking around normally, they're just dragging them along, not being

765
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,580
 used.

766
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:37,620
 They're coming along and then as soon as they want to jump, they cock them into position

767
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:40,340
 and then just fling themselves.

768
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:44,420
 They can sometimes ratchet up the strength in their back legs.

769
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:48,140
 So they kind of prepare a jump in advance and then they don't jump.

770
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,140
 Oh.

771
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,140
 You see what I mean?

772
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:53,620
 They have a locking mechanism in their legs, which means they can keep the potential energy

773
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,620
 high.

774
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:59,980
 So they are a coiled spring and then they just walk around on their front four legs and drag

775
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:05,100
 along these heavily loaded back legs with them so they can make a getaway, I guess.

776
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:09,380
 And then they exert massive amounts of G-force on themselves, don't they, when they go flying

777
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,380
 through the air.

778
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:14,020
 So they exert a G-force of over 400 G.

779
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,980
 That's what they generate when they jump up.

780
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:20,460
 And for comparison, an astronaut who goes into orbit gets G-force of about 5G.

781
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,100
 And so that's a lot.

782
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,100
 If it was a human, we wouldn't survive.

783
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,980
 And 5G is very bad for you, isn't it?

784
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:27,980
 Sorry.

785
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:28,980
 Gives you COVID?

786
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:34,020
 Yeah, yeah, I've been watching a lot of David Ike stuff.

787
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:39,340
 So people might know frog hoppers as well as spittle bugs, another name for them.

788
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:43,420
 And that's because if you ever walk out in the countryside in the middle of spring, you

789
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:48,140
 might see little bubbles of spit on bits of grass or bits of plants.

790
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:51,460
 And that is made by these frog hoppers.

791
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:56,500
 And basically, they eat all of this xylem stuff into their body and then they poo it

792
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,460
 out into little bubbles.

793
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:04,020
 And then those kind of bubbly poos is where their children live.

794
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,740
 It's a beautiful start in life.

795
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:09,860
 Well, they're just lucky to have, you know, the Bank of Mum and Dad, these kids to rely

796
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:10,860
 on.

797
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,260
 But they're sort of suffocated in there.

798
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:16,580
 So they've got to like shove a little bit of their abdomen out to breathe in.

799
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,580
 Otherwise...

800
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,580
 It's a snorkel.

801
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,580
 Yeah, it's a snorkel basically.

802
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,580
 Yeah, it's very weird.

803
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:24,380
 But then if you kind of scare the little baby as you're going past, I don't know how

804
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,780
 you would do it, I guess.

805
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:26,780
 Boo!

806
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,780
 That'll do it.

807
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,780
 Very easily scared, literally.

808
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:33,900
 It'll kind of retreat into its little bubbly foam nest and it'll stop breathing and then

809
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,860
 just hope that the threat goes away and then it'll come back out again.

810
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:41,420
 Yeah, I think sometimes they can use them as emergency oxygen tanks.

811
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:44,180
 So sometimes if you've freed them out, they'll retreat into the bubbles and they'll pierce

812
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:48,180
 a few bubbles so they bond together into a bigger bubble and use it as an emergency

813
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,180
 tank.

814
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,460
 But it's really clever, though.

815
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,460
 The cookies bit.

816
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:57,060
 It's predators because I think it tastes horrible and it also stops the larvae from

817
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,060
 drying out.

818
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,060
 It's come out of their bum, hasn't it?

819
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,060
 It's come out of their bum.

820
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,580
 Self-respecting predator is not going to have that.

821
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:06,140
 And it stops them from drying out but obviously when you then become born, you don't want

822
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:10,380
 to be soft anymore, you don't want to be wet, so what do you do?

823
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:15,780
 Well you blow an extra large bubble inside of your bubble and so more air comes in there

824
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:21,020
 and then your exoskeleton can dry out and then you can come out of the spitty bubble

825
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:23,060
 and you're fine and you can be an adult.

826
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,820
 They're such amazing creatures.

827
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:25,820
 They really are cool.

828
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,660
 Why am I learning about these all the time?

829
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:31,020
 Because they are also, when you walk around the countryside, I always thought it was sap.

830
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:34,780
 In fact, I'm pretty sure my mum once told me it was just sap and I said why is there

831
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:37,780
 loads of these globules of saliva sitting on all the plants?

832
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:41,780
 My parents always said it was cuckoo spit, which is what it's called, but they never

833
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:45,540
 went on to say which is made by an insect.

834
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:49,140
 It's possible they hadn't looked into it and they hoped you wouldn't inquire further.

835
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:55,060
 I must just say thank you to Claire Harkin, not my sister Claire Harkin but another Claire

836
00:37:55,060 --> 00:38:01,140
 Harkin with the same name who is one of the experts on frog hoppers in the UK.

837
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:07,180
 You can help her by going to her website which is spittlebugsurvey.co.uk if you see any cuckoo

838
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,860
 spit in the spring.

839
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:13,540
 The reason is we need to know where these frog hoppers are because it's possible that

840
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,380
 they can start spreading disease.

841
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:22,100
 There's a bacteria called xylella which originated in South America and when they go into the

842
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:27,860
 plant to get this xylem, they also can sometimes put the bacteria into the plant and it means

843
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:29,220
 that the plants can die.

844
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:35,300
 They basically die of thirst really and if you find this bacteria in a tree then all

845
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:39,020
 the plants within 100 metres will need to be destroyed because it's so catching this

846
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,020
 thing.

847
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:44,220
 In Italy, basically centuries old, olive groves have had to be wiped out.

848
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,380
 What caused the massive olive wipe out?

849
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,380
 Some of them for sure.

850
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,380
 Yeah, that was bad.

851
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,740
 Oh, frog hoppers, not so great after all.

852
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,940
 It's the bacterium's fault.

853
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:52,940
 I guess so.

854
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:53,940
 Yeah.

855
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:59,780
 But yeah, so if you do find any cuckoo spit in your garden then go to spittlebugsurvey.co.uk

856
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:02,260
 and let them know where it is and then we can test it.

857
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:05,020
 We should say we think the bacteria is not in the UK yet.

858
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,020
 Yes.

859
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:09,940
 But so if you find cuckoo spit in your garden, don't destroy 100 metres around everything.

860
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:13,740
 It's just important to report the presence of it so it's known where it is.

861
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:18,580
 I spoke to Claire Harkin and she sent me loads of the material I've got for this came from

862
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:19,580
 her.

863
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:20,580
 Oh, wow.

864
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:23,380
 I said from one Harkin to another, can you send me all of your frog hopper stuff please?

865
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:24,380
 Nice.

866
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:27,140
 I really hope in the future all your emails get mixed up between what you're meaning

867
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:30,820
 to send to your sister and what you send to her.

868
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:34,820
 I'm just terrified now because I remember the last time something horrible came to Italy

869
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:37,380
 and we said, "But it hasn't come to the UK yet."

870
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:45,100
 Oh, an extremely bad day.

871
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:48,460
 OK, it's time for our final fact of the show and that's my fact.

872
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:53,140
 My fact this week is that the person credited as official consultant about the future for

873
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:58,700
 the movie Back to the Future 2 is the great grandson of H. G. Wells.

874
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,700
 Very nice.

875
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,700
 Very nice.

876
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,700
 Author of?

877
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:06,540
 Author of Time Machine and War of the Worlds and so on, but obviously Time Machine, very

878
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,020
 relevant to the movie.

879
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,860
 He's not a sort of futurologist though.

880
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:10,860
 He's not a scientist.

881
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:14,500
 He actually works within the movie world, so he's a director.

882
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:19,060
 So he's a director of a great childhood favourite movie of mine, An American Tale, Five All

883
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,060
 Goes West.

884
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,060
 Yes.

885
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,700
 Yeah, he did The Prince of Egypt.

886
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:27,460
 He worked on Who Framed Roger Rabbit when he started his career, Kung Fu Panda, he worked

887
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:34,020
 on, he worked on, I'm sorry, Kung Fu Panda 3, but no, so he's, you know, he's a big Hollywood

888
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:38,620
 guy and he got brought on to Back to the Future 2 and he did some consulting about the future.

889
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,620
 What's his name?

890
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,620
 His name is Simon Wells.

891
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,620
 Simon Wells.

892
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:42,620
 Yeah.

893
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:43,620
 H. G. Wells?

894
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:44,620
 Yeah.

895
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:45,620
 What an interesting man.

896
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:46,820
 Oh my goodness.

897
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:51,900
 Incredible futurist and novelist and everything, you know, he wrote so many classic works,

898
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:56,220
 so he wrote War of the Worlds, Time Machine as we've said, The Island of Dr. Moreau, which

899
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,020
 is an absolute classic.

900
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:02,420
 The Invisible Man, I mean, almost all of it was in this really short period quite soon

901
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,420
 after he became an author.

902
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:07,660
 He stayed in author for 40 years, he wrote dozens and dozens of novels and, you know,

903
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:09,020
 hundreds of short stories and all of this.

904
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:12,700
 Yeah, he came up with so much cool stuff, he came up with Wikipedia, long time before

905
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,700
 it was made.

906
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:14,700
 Yeah, yeah.

907
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,020
 Well, it's just super fun, The World Brain.

908
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,220
 Yeah, that's a book that he published.

909
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,220
 Yeah.

910
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,220
 Yes, exactly.

911
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:24,820
 In 1936 was a lecture and in 1936 he presented it as The World Brain, which I think is what

912
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:27,140
 we should rename Wikipedia.

913
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:32,100
 And his idea was that it was an encyclopedia that was constantly changing and alive and

914
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:36,180
 maturing and being revised by Brainsome Around the World.

915
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,580
 And he said, you know, everyone should be able to refer to this for their knowledge

916
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:42,660
 of everything, schools and colleges and anyone who needs to fact check anything.

917
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:46,740
 And basically the only difference is that it would be delivered in the form of reels

918
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:50,760
 of microfilm being dropped on demand from airplanes, as opposed to...

919
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,760
 We might get that.

920
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,760
 We might get that in the future.

921
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,760
 Fingers crossed.

922
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,760
 Fingers crossed.

923
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,460
 He thought it would prompt world peace, didn't he?

924
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,460
 Yeah.

925
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:00,660
 He thought if we all had access to the same information, its creation is a way to world

926
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:01,660
 peace.

927
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:02,660
 His words.

928
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:03,660
 And he sang us in 1936.

929
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:08,940
 I think also it depends when you got him whether you want to take his futurism because in the

930
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:14,600
 early 20th century he wrote Anticipations was at massive bestseller and it was what

931
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,800
 he thought the future was going to be like and almost kind of what he thought it should

932
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:22,700
 be like because he'd read a lot of Darwin and a few other things and he thought this

933
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,060
 is the way we should go.

934
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:29,100
 And he thought basically half the population should enslave the other half of the population.

935
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:33,120
 He thought that racial and social homogeneity should be enforced.

936
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:36,160
 He thought that certain groups shouldn't be allowed to have children and certain groups

937
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,620
 should be told that they should have children.

938
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:41,740
 Arthur Conan Doyle said it was vile and villainous.

939
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:45,540
 Any man who knows science and medicine knows this book is muddle headed.

940
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:48,780
 Any man who knows humanity knows the book is horrible.

941
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,580
 I knew James was going to do this.

942
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:57,160
 George Orwell said it was politically naive and that it was a terrible book as well.

943
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,340
 It was a really, really like basically a nasty piece of work.

944
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:01,500
 It really, really was.

945
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:06,180
 But as he got older in life he definitely changed and in the 20s he started to meet

946
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,180
 presidents.

947
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:15,980
 He met Theodore Roosevelt, he even met Lenin as well and he started trying to talk them

948
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:18,260
 into a much better world.

949
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:23,820
 And actually in the end he was probably quite influential in the Universal Declaration of

950
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:27,000
 Human Rights that the UN came up with in 1948.

951
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,420
 So when he was really young he had all these ideas which were really quite bad.

952
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:34,700
 But then as he got older he kind of mellowed and he had a much better idea.

953
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:35,700
 I had no idea.

954
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,580
 I'd never heard of that anticipations thing.

955
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:38,580
 That's extraordinary.

956
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:40,620
 And that would have been after he started writing novels because I think he started

957
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:41,620
 about 1895.

958
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:45,420
 And Orwell was a big fan even though there were disagreements.

959
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:46,420
 I mean he was very mercurial.

960
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:49,340
 He had four things out with basically all of his mates in the end.

961
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:54,940
 But Orwell basically said that anyone who'd been alive and literate between 1900 and 1920

962
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:56,960
 was affected by HD Wells more than anyone else.

963
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,520
 And what a brilliant guy he'd been but later in his life.

964
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,940
 So it seems like he started bad from what James said.

965
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:06,960
 He got extremely good and then he sort of descended into like literary shitness a little

966
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:07,960
 bit again.

967
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:13,120
 And so Orwell said in the 1930s, now he seems a bit of a shallow inadequate thinker.

968
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:16,480
 But mostly he was saying, but look, I think he was a pretty good guy.

969
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,360
 And he and Wells just replied to Orwell with a note saying, you shit.

970
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:25,780
 Wow, what a great writer.

971
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:27,580
 Such a way with words.

972
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:32,660
 Jumping back to young HD Wells, he was actually born from interesting stock.

973
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:36,740
 His dad was a professional cricketer who was sort of famous in his own right.

974
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:41,700
 So he's a cricketer who took four wickets in four balls for Kent against Sussex, apparently

975
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,180
 the first time that's ever been done.

976
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,180
 Wow.

977
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:45,180
 Yeah.

978
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:46,180
 So he was he was really cool.

979
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:47,180
 That by the way is huge.

980
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:48,180
 Yeah.

981
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:54,360
 I was like, that should be the headline for that has only happened 43 times in the history

982
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,360
 of cricket.

983
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:59,240
 And there's been over 60,000 matches of first class cricket in history.

984
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:02,440
 And it's only happened 43 times and he was the first one to do it.

985
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:06,440
 And one of the people that he got out was a guy called Spencer Austin Lee, who was the

986
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:09,160
 great nephew of Jane Austen.

987
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,160
 Wow.

988
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,160
 Amazing.

989
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:16,200
 So his father then ran a crockery shop, which sold all of this crockery and also sold sporting

990
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:21,380
 goods because his great uncle was Timothy Duke and cricket fans will know the Duke's

991
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:25,340
 ball, which is a cricket ball that English teams use.

992
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:28,540
 And whenever the Aussies come over here, they always complain about the Duke's ball.

993
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:30,220
 It swings too much and all that kind of stuff.

994
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:32,420
 So he was part of that kind of family.

995
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:36,900
 So they opened this shop, but apparently the location was very poor and they didn't do

996
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:37,900
 very well.

997
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:42,220
 Although today there is a pry mark there, which I have to say does very well indeed.

998
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:45,820
 So I don't know if it was the location or not.

999
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:50,720
 But then I read an article in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, which you all know

1000
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,680
 and it's often quite dry, that book.

1001
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:58,040
 But they talked about Joseph Wells, who was his father, and they said that he once broke

1002
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:02,320
 his thigh by falling from a ladder in his backyard on a Sunday morning while the rest

1003
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,000
 of the family were at church.

1004
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,040
 Officially, he had been pruning a vine, but local gossip alleged that the church service

1005
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:15,000
 ended earlier than usual and that he was caught helping a lady friend escape over a back wall.

1006
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
 Is that amazing?

1007
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,720
 Are you sure this wasn't a Buster Keaton film?

1008
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:23,180
 Anna, you'll think about him writing to, who was it?

1009
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:24,180
 Orwell.

1010
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:25,180
 Orwell saying you shit.

1011
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:27,260
 He was quite good at grudges and rivalries.

1012
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:33,940
 So the War of the Worlds came out in I think about 1895 or six and obviously huge success.

1013
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:38,380
 It was serialized as was common then, really popular, right?

1014
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:44,580
 It was illustrated by an artist called Warwick and Goebel and Goebel's vision of the tripods

1015
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:47,920
 was these kind of ovoid pods standing on the metal beams.

1016
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,440
 And Wells hated it so much, right?

1017
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:54,880
 He hated this illustration so much that when the first collected version of the book was

1018
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,640
 released, not serialized, he added some new material.

1019
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:02,280
 And halfway through the book, he's in the middle of describing a blasted planet earth

1020
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,080
 and you know, it's in the middle of a full war.

1021
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:08,440
 And he describes the first pamphlets to give a consecutive account of the war.

1022
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:11,120
 So he's writing about a text within the fictional story.

1023
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:14,500
 He said, "The artists had evidently made a hasty study of one of the fighting machines

1024
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:15,980
 and there his knowledge ended.

1025
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:19,980
 He presented them as tilted stiff tripods without either flexibility or subtlety, with

1026
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:22,060
 an altogether misleading monotony of effect.

1027
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:25,340
 The pamphlet containing these red rings had a considerable vogue and I mentioned in here

1028
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:28,180
 simply to warn the reader against the impression they may have created."

1029
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:29,180
 Wow!

1030
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,180
 Inside the next edition.

1031
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,180
 Yeah.

1032
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:32,180
 So good.

1033
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:33,180
 So good.

1034
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:34,180
 I love it.

1035
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:35,180
 I think that's incredibly unprofessional.

1036
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:39,580
 That would ruin my enjoyment of a book if suddenly the author stepped out of it to bitch

1037
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:40,580
 about his illustration.

1038
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:41,580
 I love it.

1039
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:42,580
 No, I'm into that.

1040
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:43,580
 Okay, fine.

1041
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:47,620
 Another thing he would have hated while we're on things that he hated would have been his

1042
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:49,840
 great grandson's credit in the movie.

1043
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:50,840
 Why?

1044
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,280
 Because he didn't like credits.

1045
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,160
 He didn't think credits should be part of movies.

1046
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:59,240
 So in 1936 he wrote a movie called Things to Come and one of the things he tried to eliminate

1047
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:02,440
 from the movie was the credits because he thinks all movies shouldn't have them.

1048
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:06,880
 He thought instead when you were sitting watching the film little booklets should come round

1049
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,860
 and be handed out that would have the credits of the movie in them.

1050
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:10,860
 Great idea.

1051
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:11,860
 Yeah.

1052
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:12,860
 Nice idea.

1053
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:13,860
 No, it's not.

1054
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:16,980
 You pause the film at various moments to check your booklet and see who the casting director

1055
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:17,980
 was.

1056
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:18,980
 Not during the film, I guess.

1057
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:21,620
 But I've often wanted some explanatory notes at the end of a film.

1058
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:24,060
 You know what it's a bit like, which I think is a really good idea.

1059
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:27,300
 You know, if you go to the theatre to watch a comedy show, it's like having a program,

1060
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:28,300
 isn't it?

1061
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:29,300
 Yeah.

1062
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:30,300
 Yeah, yeah.

1063
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,780
 I think if I was to go and watch a podcast, do a live show, maybe later this year I probably

1064
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:33,780
 would buy the program.

1065
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:34,780
 That's interesting.

1066
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:35,780
 Yeah.

1067
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:38,400
 I think it's very well written and full of interesting jokes and funny episodes.

1068
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,180
 Lots of behind the scenes photos and yeah.

1069
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:43,840
 I wouldn't buy it.

1070
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:48,040
 Just one other thing, just to show his influence on this movie, there was an actor in it called

1071
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:53,300
 Ernest Thessinger and all the scenes that he was in were shot and then Wells decided,

1072
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:54,300
 "Man, I don't like him.

1073
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:55,300
 Let's get a new actor."

1074
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:59,900
 So they reshot it with a guy called Cedric Hardwick, but they didn't tell Ernest Thessinger,

1075
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:04,740
 who showed up to the premiere, sat down and discovered he wasn't in the movie.

1076
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:05,740
 That's a good prank.

1077
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:11,340
 He should have read the little booklet even before it started, he would have known.

1078
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:14,220
 You'd have a breakdown.

1079
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:15,720
 You'd have some kind of psychotic break.

1080
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,420
 Yeah, you'd think you were going insane, wouldn't you?

1081
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:18,420
 Yeah, of course.

1082
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:19,420
 You'd think you'd invented a memory.

1083
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:22,100
 Someone is on screen with someone else's face saying your lines to an actor you'd filmed

1084
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:23,100
 a scene with.

1085
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:24,100
 Yeah.

1086
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:25,460
 Yeah, you'd end up in the asylum.

1087
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:26,460
 Yeah.

1088
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:27,460
 Gosh.

1089
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:29,660
 His skin smelt of honey and ball nuts.

1090
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:30,660
 Okay.

1091
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:31,660
 What a great fact.

1092
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:32,660
 Lovely.

1093
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:33,660
 How do we know?

1094
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:36,580
 "Lover's" said so, and he had many lovers.

1095
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:37,580
 Oh, good.

1096
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:39,380
 We're getting to the sexy bit of AQ Wells.

1097
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:40,380
 This is the juice.

1098
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:41,380
 Yeah.

1099
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:44,460
 He was a great womanizer, and he wrote one...

1100
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:49,020
 No, the adjective "great" in that usually isn't said the way that you said it.

1101
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:50,020
 Sorry.

1102
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:51,860
 He was an esteemed and wonderful womanizer.

1103
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:55,380
 There was actually a lovely "Great Lives" on Radio 4.

1104
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:59,860
 It was from 2001, and it was, I don't know if you remember Humphrey Carpenter, who was

1105
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:00,860
 hosting it.

1106
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:01,860
 Yeah.

1107
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:05,780
 He was hosting Faye Weldon, the author, and she must have been about 70 at the time.

1108
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:08,180
 And she loves AQ Wells.

1109
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:10,820
 And Humphrey Carpenter said, "So would you have slept with him if you'd lived at the

1110
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:11,980
 same time?"

1111
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:14,220
 And she just said, "I daresay I would."

1112
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:15,220
 Wow.

1113
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:18,980
 Yeah, he claimed to have an open marriage, right?

1114
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:22,380
 But it sort of sounded like he had the open marriage and his wife had no choice but to

1115
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:23,380
 be in an open marriage.

1116
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:24,380
 Well, he had a couple...

1117
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:25,620
 He had a few marriages, didn't he?

1118
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:29,780
 First was to his cousin, and second was not to his cousin, I believe.

1119
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:35,180
 And what he said was, he wanted encounters with, I'm quoting here, "free, ambitious,

1120
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:38,380
 self-reliant women who would mate with me and go their way."

1121
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:41,540
 Was that in his newspaper, Adam?

1122
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:42,540
 Exactly.

1123
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:43,540
 It sounds...

1124
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:44,540
 Non-smoker preferred.

1125
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:50,700
 Can I tell you a woman that was a bit like that, his final partner in life, who was Maura

1126
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:51,700
 Budberg.

1127
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:57,060
 Now, she was a Russian whose first husband was murdered in the October Revolution.

1128
00:50:57,060 --> 00:51:02,420
 She later married Maxim Gorky, who is like the great author, and she was almost certainly

1129
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:05,620
 a double agent between Britain and the USSR.

1130
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:12,380
 One MI5 informant said of her, "She can drink an amazing quantity, mostly gin."

1131
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:14,340
 She sounds absolutely amazing.

1132
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:22,580
 And her older half-sister is someone called Alexandra Ignatieva Zakreskaya, and she was

1133
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:29,460
 the great-grandmother of a certain Nick Clegg.

1134
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:33,900
 That is the sexiest thing I've ever heard about Nick Clegg, which I know is not so

1135
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:34,900
 complex.

1136
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:39,020
 Yeah, she was super cool, although Virginia Woolf used to call her "bedbug," I think,

1137
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:41,300
 nice play on her name, which was harsh.

1138
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:42,300
 But she was like...

1139
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:43,300
 She was everywhere, Virginia Woolf.

1140
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:44,300
 I know.

1141
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:45,300
 She had her things in a lot of pies.

1142
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:46,300
 Comment on everyone.

1143
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:47,300
 Yeah.

1144
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:48,300
 She liked to comment.

1145
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:49,300
 It was kind of her game.

1146
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:54,180
 But yeah, old bedbug, or Moora Budbug, she dated loads of cool people.

1147
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:55,740
 She dated Maxim Gorky.

1148
00:51:55,740 --> 00:52:00,340
 She dated Robert Bruce Lockhart, who tried to assassinate Lenin, whilst also spying on

1149
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:01,340
 him.

1150
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:02,340
 John Lenin?

1151
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:03,340
 So she was madly...

1152
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:04,340
 He gets everywhere.

1153
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:07,340
 Had a finger in a lot of pies at John Lenin, didn't he?

1154
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:09,420
 Sorry, Anna, can you break that down for me a bit?

1155
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:13,660
 Robert Bruce Lockhart tried to assassinate Lenin while also spying on him.

1156
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:14,660
 No, sorry.

1157
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:18,740
 Lockhart tried to assassinate Lenin, and this woman, Budberg, was totally in love

1158
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:22,300
 with Lockhart, but also spying on him for Russia.

1159
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:24,820
 So she was all over the place.

1160
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:28,540
 She had a gold laundering scheme in the 1920s, I think.

1161
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:31,860
 And then there was a massive house fire that destroyed all papers and files about her.

1162
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:32,860
 How convenient.

1163
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:33,860
 Nothing.

1164
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:36,020
 But she kept turning wells down, didn't she?

1165
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:38,180
 I think he proposed lots of times to her.

1166
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:39,180
 They never married.

1167
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:40,180
 They were just like...

1168
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:41,180
 Interesting.

1169
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:42,180
 ...kind of life partners at the end.

1170
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:46,140
 Because there's a theory that she was pretending to be in love with him certainly at the start

1171
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:49,500
 to gain access to his large circle of friends, because if she was a Soviet double agent,

1172
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,500
 that was...

1173
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,500
 He was a very useful man to know.

1174
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,940
 Except that he kept falling out with all of his friends, which must have really pissed

1175
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:54,940
 her off.

1176
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:55,940
 True.

1177
00:52:55,940 --> 00:53:01,020
 Another person Wells had an affair with was a novelist called Elizabeth von Arnim, who

1178
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:02,020
 is very cool.

1179
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:05,100
 She is a really great 20th century novelist.

1180
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:07,060
 She's her work, so highly recommended.

1181
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:10,900
 But he came in through a hidden entrance, apparently, to her gaff.

1182
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:11,900
 Oh, I see.

1183
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:12,900
 Sorry.

1184
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:15,620
 And they went at it so hard that they broke her hotel bed twice.

1185
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:16,620
 Oh my God.

1186
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:17,620
 That is actually...

1187
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:20,140
 That feels like too much information about issues.

1188
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:22,140
 That's from his memoirs, alright?

1189
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:23,140
 Is it?

1190
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:24,140
 Yeah.

1191
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:25,140
 Sorry.

1192
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:26,140
 It's just the way you worded it, I think.

1193
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:30,180
 They went at it so hard.

1194
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:31,500
 He wrote two autobiographies.

1195
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,340
 One of them was clean and one of them was dirty.

1196
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:34,540
 One of them was about his sex life.

1197
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:35,540
 Really?

1198
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:37,500
 And he said, "Hold this back until all the women involved are dead."

1199
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:39,060
 Andy, can I ask?

1200
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:44,420
 When they were at this hotel and they were at it so hard that they broke their bed, did

1201
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:49,860
 the housekeeper then come up and fix the bed while they're presumably sat around waiting

1202
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:54,420
 for that to happen, and then they started having sex again and broke it again?

1203
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:56,180
 I don't know if it was the same night.

1204
00:53:56,180 --> 00:54:00,020
 What you're questioning is, was it a bad fix of the bed or was it separate beds?

1205
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:01,020
 Yeah.

1206
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:02,020
 Is the housekeeper to blame?

1207
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:03,020
 Is what we're wondering.

1208
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:07,340
 What was his trip advisor review afterwards?

1209
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:10,580
 This book sounds amazing, though, this book of all his exploits.

1210
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:13,460
 I think he was kind of criticised because in his first autobiography he didn't mention

1211
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:14,460
 any of his lovers.

1212
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:15,940
 But did it come out in his lifetime?

1213
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:16,940
 No.

1214
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:17,940
 He said to his son.

1215
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:20,820
 He gave it to his son to edit and publish, which is weird.

1216
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:21,820
 Wow.

1217
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:27,280
 His son could have got in there with my dad wrote a porno years before, right?

1218
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,380
 He said, "Keep this back until all the women are dead."

1219
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:30,380
 That meant 1984.

1220
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:32,880
 Ironically, for someone who knew George Orwell.

1221
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:33,880
 Yeah.

1222
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:34,880
 Yeah.

1223
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,120
 And lots of it was excised.

1224
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:42,500
 Lots of details were excised from it, probably, you know, bed stuff, things like that.

1225
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,620
 Can I just fill the last 20 seconds with another fact?

1226
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:45,620
 Yeah.

1227
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:46,620
 Yeah.

1228
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:51,540
 He basically invented Warhammer, I'm saying, hobby wargaming, the practice of hobby wargaming.

1229
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:54,300
 He invented a thing in 1913 called Little Wars.

1230
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:55,300
 Yeah.

1231
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:58,660
 It was so much more serious than modern tabletop wargaming because you had to have a...

1232
00:54:58,660 --> 00:54:59,660
 Okay.

1233
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:01,340
 There are a lot of people listening who are very offended by the idea that anything is

1234
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:02,620
 more serious than that.

1235
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:06,900
 You had miniature cannons, which you had to fire at the enemy's soldiers in this game

1236
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:07,900
 that H.T.

1237
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:08,900
 Wells invented.

1238
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:10,900
 And this is also a man who had sex with lots of people.

1239
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:14,380
 Stop giving people false hope.

1240
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:16,180
 I know.

1241
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:21,180
 Okay, that's it.

1242
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:22,180
 That is all of our facts.

1243
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:23,740

 All right.

 Bye.

1267
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:05,180
 Bye.

1268

1269
