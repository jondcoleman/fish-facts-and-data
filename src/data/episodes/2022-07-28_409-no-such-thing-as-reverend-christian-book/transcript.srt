00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:17,040
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,840
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week

4
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,540
 coming to you live from Paul.

5
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,540
 (audience cheering)

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,300
 (audience cheering)

7
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,500
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,940
 with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

9
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,980
 and James Harkin, and once again,

10
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,780
 we have gathered round the microphones

11
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,100
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

12
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,300
 and in no particular order, here we go.

13
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,540
 Starting with fact number one, and that is James.

14
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,360
 - My fact this week is that tardy grades

15
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,580
 can survive being shot out of a gun,

16
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,500
 but they're a bit groggy afterwards.

17
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,380
 - Tardy grades.

18
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,460
 - Tardy grades, yes.

19
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,860
 Tiny little things, not quite microscopic,

20
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,420
 you can see them if you look really, really carefully,

21
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,420
 but very, very small little things.

22
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,300
 Living in all over the world,

23
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,020
 probably some in your garden,

24
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,980
 probably some on this stage, no, they're not on this stage.

25
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,860
 They live in like moss and in bits of grass

26
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,340
 and stuff like that.

27
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,260
 They're really, really strong, powerful things.

28
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,500
 You can't kill them.

29
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,340
 Virtually nothing will kill them.

30
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,200
 - They're not powerful, like they can't put a lorry.

31
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,940
 They're not going to be able to give you a piggyback.

32
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,940
 - If you go enough of them, I reckon, what do you reckon?

33
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,020
 - I think it's enough of anything, you can put a lorry.

34
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,060
 - We don't need them to put a lorry,

35
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,580
 we just need them to drive a lorry.

36
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,100
 (laughing)

37
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,180
 - Apparently scientists, I read,

38
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,780
 can't work out a scenario in which they would go extinct

39
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,860
 prior to the actual explosion of the sun, basically.

40
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,700
 Like the end--

41
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,340
 - Well the explosion of the sun might not kill them either.

42
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,180
 - What?

43
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,060
 - So basically they can survive in space,

44
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,000
 they can survive really, really hot temperatures,

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,180
 really, really cold temperatures,

46
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,100
 they can survive loads of radiation.

47
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:58,940
 If they get in trouble,

48
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,820
 they just kind of shut their bodies down

49
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,700
 and then kind of get rid of all the water

50
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,940
 and you put a bit of water back on them

51
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,700
 and they come back alive again.

52
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,580
 And what has happened is some of these tardigrades

53
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,900
 have been sent up into space onto the moon

54
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,740
 and they've crashed into the moon.

55
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,060
 And people are wondering maybe they're alive

56
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,380
 and maybe they're actually living there on the moon.

57
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,860
 And so these people,

58
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,340
 this was a woman called Alejandra Tresbas

59
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,400
 from Queen Mary University in London.

60
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,640
 She did this experiment to see if they might still be alive.

61
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,360
 And so what she did is she put them in a gun,

62
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,720
 shot them at a wall and saw how they were, basically.

63
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,560
 - Wow.

64
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,280
 - And they could survive impacts of up to a kilometer

65
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,720
 per second, that's 2,000 miles an hour,

66
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,960
 they could survive.

67
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,560
 And shot pressures of up to 1.14 gigapascals,

68
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,920
 which I know out of context doesn't really mean anything,

69
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,160
 but it's a lot, I promise you it's a lot.

70
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,720
 - So there's life in the universe now,

71
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,400
 outside of Earth, in theory.

72
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,900
 We haven't yet confirmed it, but we know.

73
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,740
 - Awesome.

74
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,580
 - If can I just check?

75
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,780
 Can I just ask how the groggyness exhibited itself?

76
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,140
 I think we need to address this.

77
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:58,980
 - Oh yeah, yeah.

78
00:02:58,980 --> 00:02:59,820
 - Okay, yeah.

79
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:03,380
 So tardigrades are the smallest animal that have legs.

80
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,500
 They have these little legs that they crawl around with

81
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,220
 and they kind of have like a very specific gait

82
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,540
 and as they go quicker, they change the gait.

83
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,140
 But these ones, they kind of sort of staggered around

84
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,420
 a little bit when they kind of pull them back.

85
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,940
 But the problem with what you were saying, Dan,

86
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:20,220
 is the shot pressure that they've worked out

87
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,480
 that there would have been on the moon

88
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,360
 would have been greater than this 1.14 gigapascals.

89
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,920
 So we think that the ones on the moon

90
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,660
 probably are not alive.

91
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,400
 - Very disappointingly, yeah.

92
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,160
 So when scientists say we can't work out how to kill them,

93
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,360
 shoot them as the bullet of the gun.

94
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,200
 - We can work out how to,

95
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,600
 there are lots of ways you can kill them.

96
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,960
 - Yeah, you can just stamp on them.

97
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,800
 - Can you?

98
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,840
 - Yeah, they're actually really easy to kill.

99
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,520
 Okay, I'm here to give you the disappointing truth

100
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,280
 about tardigrades because they've ruled the internet

101
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,540
 is too long.

102
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,440
 A, there are plenty of ways to kill them.

103
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,040
 B, the whole, they can withstand massive temperatures.

104
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,920
 They actually just did an experiment

105
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,100
 where they realized they can't withstand temperatures

106
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,480
 for very long at all.

107
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,200
 And scientists now reckon that climate change

108
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,760
 is gonna kill them before it kills us.

109
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,600
 - No.

110
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,140
 - So the thing is, they can survive being boiled,

111
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,000
 but only if it happens quite quickly.

112
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,020
 And then they get back to a nice, normal temperature again.

113
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,100
 But they didn't experiment recently where--

114
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,140
 - It feels harsh that you're criticizing them

115
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:19,120
 for not being able to withstand indefinite boiling.

116
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,120
 I think it's impressive.

117
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,160
 If I boiled an egg and then a few minutes later

118
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,000
 it came out of the pan

119
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,080
 and it was still in its egg, raw egg state,

120
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,920
 I'd be impressed.

121
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,040
 - I turned it to a chicken.

122
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,280
 - Exactly.

123
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,920
 - I'm not demanding indefinite.

124
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,160
 I just think a couple of hours would be good.

125
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,800
 And they can't even survive, for instance,

126
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,200
 like above 37 degrees for 24 hours,

127
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,680
 half of tardigrades die,

128
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,560
 straight like within that amount of time.

129
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,000
 So, you know, any longer than that and then they all die.

130
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,100
 If you put them at 63 degrees,

131
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,580
 half of them are gone within like much shorter than that.

132
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,220
 And I think if you're in the 80s,

133
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,620
 then they don't last an hour.

134
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,460
 - Yeah.

135
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,300
 Oh, I see, sorry.

136
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,500
 - Not the 1980s. - The 1980s, yeah.

137
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,860
 - Amazing they made it through that decade.

138
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,180
 It was a horrible decade for them.

139
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,020
 - Oh, the music.

140
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,100
 - They are crushed by a Rubik's cube.

141
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,380
 I don't think they are shit.

142
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,220
 - What?

143
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,820
 - Well, I'm gonna stand up for tardigrades.

144
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,580
 - They do this thing, tardigrades do this thing.

145
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,140
 It's seeding the world on its own.

146
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,460
 So it can get picked up by the wind.

147
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,360
 It can get carried in the wind, land wherever,

148
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,120
 and then wherever it lands,

149
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,800
 it can just reproduce asexually.

150
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,880
 It doesn't need a partner.

151
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,480
 You could send it to the moon, just one,

152
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,960
 and it'll be like, that's cool, I'll set up a colony.

153
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,400
 Like it's a phenomenal little creature.

154
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,680
 - And the confusing thing about that,

155
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,080
 'cause there are obviously lots of organisms

156
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,840
 that can reproduce asexually,

157
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,360
 but it's quite confusing that they've managed

158
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,040
 to evolve successfully, right?

159
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,560
 Because asexual reproduction,

160
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,080
 it's supposed to be a bit of a disadvantage

161
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,720
 'cause you're only getting your own genes

162
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,560
 over and over again.

163
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,760
 You can't improve.

164
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,500
 - And so how have they managed to do this?

165
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,040
 - They have sex too.

166
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,380
 They do also have sex under normal circumstances

167
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,500
 if they can find another of the opposite sex.

168
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,060
 And it's a very romantic process actually.

169
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,020
 Tardigrade mating is very fascinating.

170
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,320
 So here we go.

171
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,160
 Step one.

172
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:06,200
 - You've already killed any set of robots.

173
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,540
 - Why don't you do it in like a Craig David style?

174
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,820
 What would you do on a Monday?

175
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,440
 - On a Monday, the female would shed her outer skin

176
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,080
 and lay her eggs inside it.

177
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,600
 - Keep talking to me.

178
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,440
 Yes.

179
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,600
 - Okay, on a Tuesday?

180
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,960
 - A Tuesday, the male would then arrive

181
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,880
 and get into position and then fertilize the eggs,

182
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,960
 which are--

183
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,800
 - Wait, wait, wait.

184
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,120
 That's making love on Thursday and Friday and Saturday.

185
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,640
 - Oh, Tuesday Wednesday is waiting.

186
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,320
 And then, when the male arrives,

187
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,000
 so the male basically fertilizes the female's eggs,

188
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,760
 which are outside her body,

189
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,440
 but they're still inside the shed exoskeleton

190
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,700
 that she has cast off.

191
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,380
 - But the thing about what she does with the skeleton

192
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,980
 is she doesn't get out of it.

193
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,820
 It's a bit like she takes--

194
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,940
 - No, she's still inside, she's--

195
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,380
 - Yeah, so she sheds it,

196
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,060
 but it's like taking your arms out of a coat,

197
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,780
 but keeping it around you.

198
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,620
 - It's like a much more disgusting version of doing that.

199
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,460
 - Yes.

200
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,300
 - Right, yeah.

201
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,820
 And then the male has sex with the coat is what we say.

202
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,660
 - Yes.

203
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,500
 (laughing)

204
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,860
 - Yes, exactly.

205
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,700
 - Wow.

206
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,220
 - The male has sex in between the coat and you.

207
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,540
 (laughing)

208
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,020
 - And then you just chill on Sunday, yeah.

209
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:09,860
 (laughing)

210
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:13,800
 - The good thing is, they do it to the face,

211
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,640
 but it ends up around the back.

212
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,300
 And this scientists don't understand

213
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,140
 how this works yet.

214
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:19,980
 - I don't understand what you're saying.

215
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:24,820
 - Right, so if you picture their sexual position,

216
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:29,820
 the male curls himself around the female's face.

217
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:33,080
 Okay, so his crotch is in her face.

218
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,240
 Her face is buried in his crotch.

219
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,400
 And then she does these weird sucking motions

220
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,740
 with her throat, which kind of stimulates.

221
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,580
 - Oh my God.

222
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,620
 - This genuinely happens, and it is quite romantic.

223
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,300
 - Mr. David, I think we're gonna need to rewrite

224
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,420
 us some of these lyrics.

225
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:49,180
 (laughing)

226
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,460
 - She doesn't see sucking motions.

227
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,420
 It's a full hour of foreplay.

228
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,260
 - Wow.

229
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,900
 - Kind of unbelievable for these tiny creatures.

230
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,100
 And then he ejaculates multiple times.

231
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,620
 Impressive, guys, take note.

232
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,180
 But then he ejaculates under the skin,

233
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:05,000
 but then her eggs come out the back, her cloaca.

234
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,760
 So we don't really know how the sperm

235
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,780
 is climbing all the way around to get to the eggs.

236
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,860
 - And what happens to the coats, though, I don't...

237
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,700
 - Yeah.

238
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,700
 - Oh, I think they grow up in the coat, don't they?

239
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,220
 I think the eggs are fertilized,

240
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,420
 but they stay inside the coat, and I think that's a...

241
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,060
 - I was thinking that poor dry cleaner

242
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,300
 when you hand that in.

243
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,060
 (laughing)

244
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,100
 - I agree, Dan, they're not shit.

245
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,260
 They're not completely shit.

246
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,180
 They're about one-third shit.

247
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,060
 And that is because they can poo one-third

248
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,740
 the size of their body in a single go.

249
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,840
 - Ah, like a sloth.

250
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,680
 Sloths do that, don't they?

251
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,320
 - Sloths do that, do they, one-third.

252
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,760
 - I think that baby sloths, baby sloths can be here.

253
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,840
 - Well, it's the equivalent of me pooing out

254
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,640
 a large pair of speakers, a 10-year-old child,

255
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,300
 or an adult Dalmatian.

256
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,960
 (laughing)

257
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,140
 - A 10-year-old child?

258
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,240
 (laughing)

259
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,960
 - Is this a game of "Would You Rather?"

260
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,320
 (laughing)

261
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,120
 - I'm not sure about this 101 Dalmatians remake, actually.

262
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,880
 I think I'd rather...

263
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,680
 - Wow. - Wow, that's a lot of poo.

264
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,900
 - It's amazing, the video is good, isn't it?

265
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,220
 You should really watch the video of Tardigreads

266
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,620
 taking a poo, a Tardigread taking a poo,

267
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,940
 'cause you can feel it really trying to squeeze it out

268
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,900
 and get away from it.

269
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,300
 And it's enormous, I think it looks much bigger

270
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,460
 than a third of its body.

271
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,460
 - There are two of them, it's by weight, it's a third.

272
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,940
 There are two videos of them pooing.

273
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,780
 One of them, it's like really, really trying.

274
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,900
 The other one, it's finding it a lot easier,

275
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,060
 but the researcher who was doing that reckons it's

276
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,300
 because it was squashed between two pieces of glass,

277
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,700
 and maybe the squashing this helped it to send the poo out.

278
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,600
 - Oh my gosh, it's like a fetish video then

279
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,440
 that you guys watched.

280
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,040
 (laughing)

281
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,600
 - It's like when you massage your stomach a bit

282
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,560
 to help out with conservation.

283
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,400
 - Just like that.

284
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,240
 - Exactly.

285
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,120
 - Just like that, the Tommy Cooper cat race.

286
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,200
 (laughing)

287
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,600
 Can we talk about them the way they suspend

288
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,720
 and then reanimate?

289
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,680
 - Okay, sure. - 'Cause it is really,

290
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,400
 really cool, so they, as James said,

291
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,560
 if their environment dries out, so they live in moss,

292
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,160
 they also get called moss piglets, which is adorable.

293
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,000
 And if their bit of moss dries out,

294
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,060
 then they dry out with it, as it were,

295
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:10,240
 and they enter a thing called cryptobiosis.

296
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,620
 So they roll into a ball, they shrivel up,

297
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,540
 they're normally 85% water,

298
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,440
 that goes down to 3% water,

299
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,980
 so they're almost completely desiccated.

300
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:22,700
 But then, if you put water on them, whoop, back they come.

301
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,660
 And scientists have been testing for decades

302
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,740
 how long they can go for, and the problem is,

303
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,700
 you need a tardigrade that was dried out

304
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,740
 decades ago to experiment.

305
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,160
 - The latest experiment on this was in 1983,

306
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,040
 a group of Japanese scientists in Antarctica,

307
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,200
 they found and they froze a group of tardigrades,

308
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,260
 and 31 years later, in 2014,

309
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,800
 they popped some water on them, and they woke up.

310
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,120
 - Wow. - Took them about two weeks,

311
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,840
 but they were called SB1 and SB2

312
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,800
 for Sleeping Beauty One and Sleeping Beauty Two.

313
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,360
 - Aw. - That's nice.

314
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,840
 - And one of them, one of them,

315
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,360
 they both came around, one egg they had frozen also,

316
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,740
 hatched into a healthy tardigrade,

317
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,160
 which then laid its own eggs eight days later.

318
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,200
 It's incredible the way they come back, yeah.

319
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,820
 - But did they have lots of very dated cultural references?

320
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,780
 (laughing)

321
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:08,060
 - There was a story of one that was found in a museum,

322
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,420
 wasn't there, that was 100 years old,

323
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,140
 supposedly came back to life as well,

324
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,120
 but that's not in a paper, that's kind of anecdotal.

325
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,180
 - It's a bit, yeah, it's an Italian scientist

326
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:19,820
 who said it moved its leg, and it's kind of unclear

327
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,780
 whether it moved its leg or whether he nudged it a bit,

328
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,060
 and so I, oh, look, there it is, yeah, yeah.

329
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,620
 But we're gonna have to move on to our next fact

330
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,460
 in a sec, guys.

331
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:30,180
 - Can I, just because I'm the anti-tardigrade on the panel,

332
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,940
 I'd like to put forward my rival to tardigrades,

333
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,280
 and that is the Deloitte rotifer,

334
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,040
 and this is another tiny creature,

335
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,800
 about the same size, maybe a tiny bit smaller,

336
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,400
 you could maybe, it's just on the cusp of being seeable,

337
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,640
 and they can do all the same stuff,

338
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,160
 survive unbelievable extremes,

339
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,640
 like massive amounts of radiation,

340
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,320
 huge heat being in permafrost for ages,

341
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,440
 much more radiation than tardigrades can survive,

342
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,720
 by the way, and they were thought to be able

343
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,700
 to last a decade frozen and completely dried out,

344
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,660
 and then be able to reanimate themselves,

345
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,260
 and scientists just found some trapped

346
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,180
 in Siberian permafrost, and realized they have

347
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:12,180
 to reassess that, and it's not a decade they can,

348
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,820
 you know, stay frozen and then come back to life,

349
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,580
 it's 24,000 years.

350
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,420
 - Oh, what?

351
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,260
 - No.

352
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,500
 - Pop some water on, sprung straight back into action.

353
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,700
 - Those are pretty dated references, aren't they?

354
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,540
 (all laughing)

355
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,220
 It's like, oh, what about those bully mothers today?

356
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,780
 - Yeah, they sound shit.

357
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,620
 - Wow.

358
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,460
 - All right.

359
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,280
 - Not nice is it?

360
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,120
 - Not nice.

361
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,960
 (all laughing)

362
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,780
 - Yeah.

363
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,620
 Thank you.

364
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,080
 - They also, they're called Deloids,

365
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,920
 and they begin with, guys, what do they begin with?

366
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,760
 What letter?

367
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,580
 - D.

368
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,940
 - A B, a silent B.

369
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,000
 (all laughing)

370
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,460
 - You're kidding.

371
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,300
 - How brave is that?

372
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,280
 - Like, is it a leech is a Deloid, isn't it?

373
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,120
 - Is it?

374
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,160
 - I think so.

375
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,000
 - Interesting.

376
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,640
 - No one knows that, so that might be wrong.

377
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,560
 - Yeah.

378
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,640
 Anyway, we need to move on to our second fact,

379
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,680
 time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

380
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,620
 My fact is that, in the 1920s,

381
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,300
 Chicago was hit by a miniature crime wave

382
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,700
 of testicle theft, which was nicknamed,

383
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,380
 which was nicknamed, "Gland Larsony."

384
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,260
 (all laughing)

385
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,500
 Really impressive.

386
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,220
 - Do you think if you'd had your testicles removed

387
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,940
 and you read that newspaper article,

388
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,900
 you'd be like, ah, good one.

389
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,740
 (all laughing)

390
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,180
 Do you think they're making light

391
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,020
 of what is probably quite a horrific experience?

392
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,140
 - It sounds terrible, it sounds terrible,

393
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,240
 but it is presented as a kind of funny thing

394
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,640
 that happened once, and it has been a hundred years.

395
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,360
 So, let's get into it.

396
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,960
 Next year, it actually is the centenary,

397
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,640
 so I know a lot of people will probably

398
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,440
 be wanting to market somehow.

399
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,520
 - I think it's gonna be a public holiday, isn't it?

400
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,240
 - I think I might have a big ball.

401
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,280
 (all laughing)

402
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,440
 - Well, one person who didn't have a big ball, James,

403
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,160
 once this crime wave happened to him,

404
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,440
 the first victim in Chicago, who's an electrician,

405
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,680
 is called Henry Johnson.

406
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,760
 He's called Johnson, huh?

407
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,100
 And he was found unconscious in the street.

408
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:02,020
 And he'd been out for a drink, he got into a street car,

409
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,900
 and he remembered nothing else after that,

410
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,540
 but he was quite late, he'd been out,

411
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:08,660
 and his testicles had gone.

412
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:12,100
 And he may have been chloroformed or something like this,

413
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,500
 it's kind of hazy.

414
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,220
 He didn't report it to the police, apparently,

415
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,380
 he just went home and then went back to work.

416
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,220
 - Wow.

417
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,420
 - Really?

418
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,260
 Yeah.

419
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,100
 - It was a different time,

420
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,740
 you were stoic back then, wasn't it?

421
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:26,060
 (all laughing)

422
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,300
 - Oh, well, these things happen.

423
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,300
 - Yeah.

424
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,300
 - It happened, it did happen, it happened.

425
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,620
 - It's such a hard thing to call in sick to your boss for,

426
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,460
 isn't it?

427
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,300
 (all laughing)

428
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,500
 I've lost my testicles.

429
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,220
 (all laughing)

430
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,860
 - Pull the other one, I can't.

431
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,440
 (all laughing)

432
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,840
 - The earliest report I could find on newspapers.com,

433
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,160
 which is like all the old American newspapers

434
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,400
 that we go on sometimes.

435
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,300
 It was a Sioux City Journal on the 14th of October, 1922.

436
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,160
 Actually, it was the same report was in lots of them,

437
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,720
 but this was the first one that came up.

438
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,220
 But the next story in the newspaper was about the son

439
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,980
 of Leo Tolstoy, who had lost his family jewels.

440
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,820
 - No.

441
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,660
 (all laughing)

442
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,500
 - That is very good.

443
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,340
 - It's not cool, yeah, yeah.

444
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,180
 - That's really cool.

445
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,860
 - That's gotta be some deliberate editorial decision

446
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,700
 making there, I love that.

447
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,660
 - Here's a question, right?

448
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,640
 Do you think this actually happened?

449
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,020
 Or do you think it was a medi-uppy thing?

450
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:18,860
 - Oh.

451
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,460
 - It definitely became a panic.

452
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,280
 - The rock?

453
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,120
 - Yeah.

454
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,920
 - The stories were a bit, so you were talking

455
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:29,640
 about Henry Johnson, and he came to explain

456
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,640
 that he was missing his testicles off the back

457
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,600
 of a different person first revealing it.

458
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,360
 So it's like he didn't tell anyone, press-wise,

459
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,160
 but there was a guy called Joseph Wozniak who told,

460
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,880
 and then other people came out and said,

461
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,960
 "Me me too, my balls were taken."

462
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,920
 And Johnson was one of them.

463
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,280
 But the report that I read,

464
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,080
 the article that you sent round to us,

465
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,940
 it said he discovered that one or both

466
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,020
 of his testicles were missing.

467
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,860
 And that's a curious thing to say.

468
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,740
 - Was that Wozniak?

469
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,940
 - Yeah, there were different standards

470
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,460
 of self-care back in the day.

471
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,300
 - Right.

472
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,140
 - Yeah.

473
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:05,140
 - 'Cause I was equally confused by his story.

474
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,540
 In the article that I read about him,

475
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,380
 it said that all that happened was he woke

476
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,100
 in the streets not remembering how he got there,

477
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,100
 horrible taste in his mouth, chloroform,

478
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,460
 pain in his groin, got through the day,

479
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:18,100
 and then went to hospital where the doctor discovered

480
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,760
 his testicles had been removed,

481
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,140
 which I would have thought you would have realized.

482
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,520
 - But it'd be swollen, you'd be uncomfortable,

483
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,600
 maybe you might not be analyzing yourself properly.

484
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,960
 - You'd be bandaged as well, right?

485
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,800
 Presumably.

486
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,860
 - Well, you bandaged.

487
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,760
 No, I think this is before he's gone to the hospital.

488
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,520
 - No, there's been other cases, I think,

489
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,060
 where the people who were removing the testicles

490
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,940
 bandaged up because they weren't trying to kill people.

491
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,260
 They just wanted their testicles.

492
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:45,280
 - Wait, sorry, do you think you'd be so uncurious

493
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,480
 that if you woke up on the street

494
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,820
 and you had a big old bandage around your crotch,

495
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,480
 you'd just go, "You know what, I'm not gonna touch it.

496
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,800
 "I'm not gonna touch it.

497
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,240
 "It's none of my business."

498
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,980
 (laughing)

499
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:01,120
 - It kind of gets in the heart of it.

500
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,560
 - It's so hard to tell.

501
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,220
 I think it may have happened to one or two people,

502
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,300
 but not to all of them.

503
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,040
 So, for example, there was a guy who,

504
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,320
 a young man called John Powell.

505
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,560
 This was in 1923, there were a couple more cases of it,

506
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,840
 or certainly a ledge case in 1923,

507
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,120
 a young man called John Powell,

508
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,440
 who was allegedly assaulted by three men

509
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,720
 wearing white lab coats, who were shouting,

510
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,080
 "We need a gland," and I don't know if that is true,

511
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,880
 but it was true that the authorities took it seriously.

512
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,640
 They promised to charge gland banditry,

513
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,800
 genuinely the phrase that was used to refer to it,

514
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,640
 they made it a special crime, that was the crime of mayhem.

515
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,880
 They sort of included gland banditry in the charge

516
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,920
 of mayhem so you could get 14 years in prison

517
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,400
 if you were found guilty of it, so there were responses.

518
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,760
 - I think the evidence that I could find,

519
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,480
 so a few things is, first of all,

520
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,000
 it's really hard to use chloroform to knock someone out.

521
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,680
 There's technically really a difficult thing to do.

522
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,120
 - So in movies when we see that,

523
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:54,960
 that takes a couple of minutes.

524
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,040
 - Yeah, yeah, you would need to hold it over

525
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,760
 for like five or 10 minutes.

526
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,680
 Often they would use other drugs as well.

527
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,360
 Sometimes, you know, there are ways of doing it.

528
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,720
 You'd have to know what you're doing to get the right dose.

529
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,800
 You'd have to hold their head up

530
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,280
 so they don't swallow their tongue.

531
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,560
 So that's a bit dodgy.

532
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,080
 The other thing is all the articles

533
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,960
 warn about the dangers of liquor,

534
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,960
 and this was in the time of prohibition.

535
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,760
 So they're always saying, like,

536
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,160
 "Oh, well, maybe sobriety and early hours

537
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,320
 "would prevent much anguish for this person

538
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,280
 "who lost his testicles," stuff like that.

539
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,040
 - They're saying they were drunk.

540
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,200
 - They're saying that basically,

541
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,080
 there's prohibition happening, you shouldn't be drinking,

542
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,720
 but if you do drink, you might lose your bowls.

543
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,840
 So there's a bit of that there,

544
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,040
 but then one of the articles referenced a surgeon

545
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,400
 called Anthony Sigmund Sampolinsky,

546
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,520
 and I checked him and he definitely did exist.

547
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,640
 So, you know, there was definitely some stuff there

548
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,720
 that was definitely real, so it's kind of weird.

549
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,440
 - I don't know. - It's a really curious one.

550
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,760
 The theory that was launched was that it was to...

551
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,040
 This is the exact phrasing from the newspaper.

552
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:55,320
 It was possibly done to rejuvenate some wealthy ancient,

553
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:59,680
 i.e. an elderly millionaire wanted some pep.

554
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,200
 - But wait a minute, but that was happening, though, wasn't it?

555
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,200
 - But that's the weird thing.

556
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,160
 That definitely was happening at the time,

557
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,360
 which lends credence to this,

558
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,320
 and maybe it was a panic off the back of the fact

559
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,720
 that people were going around inserting testicles

560
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,560
 into themselves.

561
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,640
 - Yeah, shove in Younger Man's testicles on yourself

562
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,200
 when you will become his Younger Self,

563
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,040
 is what they thought.

564
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,640
 And then in Chicago, there was a famous doctor,

565
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,440
 Dr. Lespinass, and he did, I think,

566
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,880
 one of the first successful testicle transplant ops

567
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,400
 in 1911, and this was actually for a man

568
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,160
 who'd lost both his testicles,

569
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,320
 weirdly, in two separate incidents.

570
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,280
 - Stop.

571
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,240
 Just don't go back to that place.

572
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,160
 - Just resign your job at the archery range.

573
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,800
 - So he's lost both--

574
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,720
 - Two separate incidents.

575
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,840
 - Yeah, one was an accident,

576
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,200
 and then one was a botch-turnier operation.

577
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,040
 - Oh, that's terrible.

578
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,000
 - I know, it's very sad.

579
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,840
 - That's a real bit, that's a real bit.

580
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,840
 - Sorry we made jokes about that.

581
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,240
 - But he had this surgery,

582
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,000
 and so this is where the origin of the testicle transplant,

583
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,880
 giving you this amazing virility he came from.

584
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,960
 He had this surgery, and he said,

585
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,400
 "After the surgery, he had a strong erection

586
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,480
 "accompanied by marked sexual desire, so intense,

587
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,160
 "he insisted on checking out of the hospital right away

588
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,000
 "so he could satisfy it."

589
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,040
 - Wow. - And so his doctor was like,

590
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,280
 "Wow, I found this amazing new thing for you guys."

591
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,400
 - And that was the guy in Chicago, right?

592
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,240
 - Yeah, yeah.

593
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,480
 - And these things were in Chicago as well, right?

594
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,800
 - Yeah, exactly. - These testicle thefts.

595
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,080
 And in the same year as these thefts happened,

596
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,720
 there was a very, very famous example

597
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,400
 of the richest man in Chicago who's called Harold McCormick,

598
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,840
 and he underwent some kind of surgery,

599
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,160
 and they never said what it was,

600
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,840
 but all the press was certain

601
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,160
 that he was getting bowls put into his bowls.

602
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,200
 Everyone was so sure he was gonna do it,

603
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,600
 and it was Lesbian Ass again who was doing it.

604
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,600
 And the thing was, he had just married this woman

605
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,840
 called Gana Valska, who was an opera singer

606
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,400
 who was much, much younger than him.

607
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,560
 She was very, very famous.

608
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,240
 Her first four husbands had been worth a total

609
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,760
 of $125 million.

610
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,800
 - First four?

611
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,920
 - Yeah, he was her fifth.

612
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,200
 - That's going it. - That's going some, right?

613
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,640
 But then he married her, and the idea was that he thought

614
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,080
 he'd never be able to keep up with her

615
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,560
 if he didn't have this operation.

616
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,800
 She was amazing, by the way.

617
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,600
 After she divorced McCormick,

618
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,520
 she married a guy called Harry Mathews

619
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,480
 who claimed to have created a death ray.

620
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,720
 - Cool. - This is the most amazing

621
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,160
 woman I've never heard of.

622
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,120
 He was British, this guy, it was in 1924.

623
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,760
 He told everyone that he'd invented this death ray,

624
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,880
 and the government said, "Oh, can we have a look at it?"

625
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,520
 And he went, "Well, give me some money first."

626
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,760
 And they went, "Well, we're not gonna do that."

627
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,680
 He went, "All right, I'm going to France then."

628
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,480
 And he said he was gonna go away,

629
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,000
 and there was a law made to stop him

630
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,200
 from going and selling his death ray,

631
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,840
 which obviously didn't exist to the French

632
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,120
 and to the other people. - That's so funny.

633
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,360
 - Wow. - Yeah.

634
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,520
 - So what was her type?

635
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,440
 It's hard, like, just weirdos?

636
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,840
 - Very, very rich men to start off with.

637
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,880
 Then men with testicles put into their testicles.

638
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,120
 Then death ray guys, and then she ended up

639
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,040
 with a yoga teacher.

640
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,040
 - The obvious end point.

641
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,800
 - Anna, I don't think the 1911 guy

642
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,280
 was actually the very first,

643
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,960
 'cause I think there was a previous doctor called

644
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,280
 Charles-Edward Brown-Sequod. - Yeah, he was in my band.

645
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,760
 - So in the 1880s, he was convinced

646
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,760
 that you could reverse your aging.

647
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,840
 He was a brilliant doctor, by the way.

648
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,080
 He genuinely was a great doctor.

649
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,360
 He worked on the spinal cord

650
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,600
 and revolutionized our understanding of it.

651
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:23,600
 But he also, okay, he started injecting himself

652
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,960
 not only with human seed,

653
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,840
 but he started with dog and guinea pig seed.

654
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,960
 - Mm, guinea pig seed. - Mixed up with blood

655
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,080
 just to really, you know, make it weirder.

656
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,600
 - And he claimed, he was in his early 70s at the time,

657
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,880
 and he said, "This has done me a power of good."

658
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,120
 - All I do all day is run around in a wheel.

659
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,880
 (laughing)

660
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,080
 - He claimed his eyes had improved.

661
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,320
 He could see better.

662
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,960
 He could run up and down stairs again,

663
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,240
 which he hadn't done for years.

664
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,640
 He claimed he could lift 15 pounds more than previously.

665
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,120
 And he claimed the average length of his jet of urine

666
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,800
 had increased by 25%.

667
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,800
 - Okay. - All thanks to guinea pig.

668
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,240
 - That's what you want. - You stood next to him

669
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,080
 and said, "Are you riding on it?

670
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,440
 "He's three feet behind you."

671
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,520
 (laughing)

672
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,080
 - And the operation go.

673
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,200
 - So you ride all punches through the wall.

674
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,960
 (laughing)

675
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,320
 - That's amazing. - And that set off,

676
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,560
 'cause I think we've mentioned him before,

677
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,280
 and guinea pig testicle transplants became a big thing.

678
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,080
 But that set off a big wave of kind of transplanting,

679
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,400
 other experiments with other animal testicle transplants.

680
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,120
 And so, there was a surgeon called Serge Voronoff,

681
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,680
 and his wife, Mrs. Voronoff,

682
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,680
 Dr. and Mrs. Voronoff, who became very famous

683
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,760
 for implanting monkey testicles into men.

684
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,440
 And what they would do is,

685
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,120
 they'd remove the monkey testicle,

686
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,680
 cut it into segments,

687
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,160
 and then they'd make an incision

688
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,960
 in the scrotum of the human,

689
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:46,040
 and then they would slot one of the segments into that.

690
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,360
 - Okay. - Like squeezing

691
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,600
 an extra slice into a cake sort of thing.

692
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,080
 - Or a chocolate orange kind of thing.

693
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,200
 - Oh, wow. - Yes, yeah, yeah.

694
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,480
 - And how many times would you,

695
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,440
 I just, I'm trying to picture a millionaire

696
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,480
 walking around with 16 testicles worth of testicles in there,

697
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,360
 like, just adding to it, just really indulging.

698
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,800
 - It's a good job they don't do it anymore, isn't it?

699
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,440
 Can you imagine, like, I don't know,

700
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,080
 Mark Zuckerberg walking around with, like,

701
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,160
 200,000 testicles dragging behind them?

702
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,920
 - Well, the names we're mentioning

703
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,040
 are quite obscure names from history,

704
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,840
 but there is one name that sticks out

705
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,640
 who supposedly had monkey testicle injections

706
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,480
 into his own nut bag,

707
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,000
 and that is W.B. Yates, the poet.

708
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,640
 - Oh. - Supposedly he had this done.

709
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:36,000
 And, yeah, I mean, and he was very sex-crazy

710
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,200
 into his later life.

711
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,120
 He supposedly was going to Harley Street in London,

712
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,640
 and he was having these things.

713
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,600
 It was all rumours.

714
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,680
 We weren't, I don't think it's been fully confirmed,

715
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,080
 but he had multiple affairs in the final,

716
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,520
 about twilight years of his life.

717
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,480
 - And he was a weirdo, yeah, essentially.

718
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,120
 He was into some freaky shit.

719
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,960
 So I believe it. - The occult and stuff, yeah.

720
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,760
 - Yeah, exactly.

721
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,360
 Apparently, if you have your,

722
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,120
 let's say a testicle falls out of you,

723
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,200
 you have-- - Let's just say.

724
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,360
 - Let's just say scenario,

725
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,240
 you're going home tonight here in Poole,

726
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,400
 and whoop, my testicle's fallen out.

727
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,840
 You have between four to six hours

728
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,840
 of getting it back inside. - That's ages.

729
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,240
 - You must have to keep it on ice

730
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,440
 in the meantime, I should think.

731
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,640
 - Yeah, exactly, so we did Richard Herring's podcast

732
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,600
 not too long ago, and Richard Herring, sadly, very,

733
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,280
 he's absolutely fine, but he had testicular cancer

734
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,760
 and he had a testicle removed.

735
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,480
 He asked us to find some facts about it,

736
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,760
 and one of the things that I found out

737
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:33,240
 was that a testicle transplant had happened

738
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,200
 in recent years between two identical twins,

739
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:40,720
 one of whom was born with the testicles, just two,

740
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,200
 but the other was missing them entirely,

741
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,840
 and they were able to transplant a testicle

742
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,400
 to the brother, and they were in their 30s,

743
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,560
 and it was a doctor called Dr. Dickon Coe,

744
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:56,560
 and Dr. Dickon was able to successfully transplant it,

745
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,600
 and it was great because you were transplanting it

746
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,960
 basically to the same body.

747
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,880
 - 'Cause it's genetically, we're identical twins.

748
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,200
 - Yeah, exactly, yeah, but four to six hours is roughly--

749
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,640
 - Do you mean four to six hours

750
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,600
 during which the testicle will still be viable?

751
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,040
 - Yes. - Okay, so when you said

752
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,040
 if your testicle falls out, you know,

753
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,440
 you do have to sort of sew up the wound and stuff,

754
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,880
 and you just mean the testicle,

755
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,200
 you'll still be able to reattach it,

756
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,920
 and it will still function. - Yes, and it will still function

757
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,680
 as a transplanted object of the body, yeah.

758
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,520
 - If it's happening now,

759
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,360
 you can stay 'til the end of the show,

760
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,760
 and you still have bags of time.

761
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,880
 - Yeah, I'll say bags.

762
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,560
 - We need to move on to our next fact.

763
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:37,000
 It is time for fact number three, and that is Anna.

764
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,040
 - Yes, my fact this week is that until 2016,

765
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:45,040
 the Indian government earned $10 million a year

766
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:48,800
 from a single tiger, pretty impressive tiger.

767
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,040
 - How do you make so much money from a tiger?

768
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,760
 - It just worked really hard.

769
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:56,080
 No, this was a tiger called Machli, very famous tiger,

770
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,240
 big celebrity in India, and Bengal Tigress, in fact,

771
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:05,240
 and she just became famous for being impressive

772
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,240
 and hardcore, lasting a long time.

773
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,120
 She did, she was constantly defeating the odds,

774
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,200
 so she would fight lots of much bigger male tigers

775
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,920
 for territory, she had one very famous altercation

776
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:20,280
 with a 14 foot crocodile that weighed twice as much of her,

777
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,000
 which, again, she had a real eye for PR

778
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,440
 because she always did this in front of tourists.

779
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,960
 So whenever a safari load of people came around,

780
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,360
 then suddenly she'd do something incredible,

781
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,000
 like kill a crocodile, which is a great pose,

782
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,280
 a very photogenic.

783
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,240
 And so, yeah, raked in money for the government,

784
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,280
 the state government.

785
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,720
 - For just people visiting to see her.

786
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,200
 - Exactly, yeah, estimated the number of people

787
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,480
 who just booked their holiday for her.

788
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,520
 - I read that she won a Lifetime Achievement Award

789
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,760
 for being a tiger.

790
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,520
 (laughing)

791
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,440
 - That's not that difficult, is it?

792
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,240
 Like, she is a tiger, so surely every tiger

793
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,840
 has a lifetime of being a tiger.

794
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,400
 - But I don't know, I don't think they do.

795
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,760
 - Who was the award from?

796
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,040
 - Well, it wasn't BAFTA, I don't know exactly.

797
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,880
 Sorry, I didn't know who it was,

798
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,600
 it was Travel Operators for Tigers.

799
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,160
 - Oh, but yeah, you really won that one, don't you?

800
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,000
 - It's not the fucking Oscars.

801
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,840
 - I know, but--

802
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,200
 - Probably the Oscars for tigers.

803
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,520
 - It may very well be-- - Exactly, yes.

804
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,280
 - It's very dangerous to have that award at the Oscars.

805
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,840
 That's a health and safety nightmare.

806
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,520
 Like, what dressing room do they use?

807
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,640
 It wouldn't work.

808
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,920
 - The carpet would be read by the end of the Oscars.

809
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,440
 - That's true.

810
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,000
 - But yeah, she was super cool,

811
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,360
 and she was so valuable to the government

812
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,120
 that in the end, her life was extended,

813
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,960
 so she died when she was 19,

814
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,080
 which was very old for a wild tiger.

815
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,880
 They'd usually die when they're 15.

816
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,320
 But one of the reasons that she died so old

817
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,440
 is because she lost a few of her teeth,

818
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,560
 she lost her canines,

819
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,840
 but actually she lost one eye,

820
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,800
 'cause she was always in these fights.

821
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,760
 And it was thought then that she was so valuable

822
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,600
 to the state, and people would be so devastated

823
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,920
 if she sort of starved to death,

824
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,080
 'cause she lost her teeth,

825
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,600
 that the state started leaving meat for her,

826
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,200
 a sort of tethered goat out in the wild,

827
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,440
 so they didn't take her-- - And they were like alive,

828
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,360
 weren't they, the goats?

829
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,040
 - Yes, yeah, so they didn't take her into captivity.

830
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,440
 They just left her in the wild,

831
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,400
 but with a nice tethered goat.

832
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,800
 She must have thought that, I don't know,

833
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,000
 Christmas would come every single day.

834
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,560
 - She must have thought that goats have got a bit stupid.

835
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,640
 - Yeah.

836
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,880
 - Was the money purely from people

837
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,360
 visiting the place that she resided,

838
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,000
 or was she, okay, so she wasn't doing like Pepsi ads,

839
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,240
 or like, she wasn't on T-shirts and merch?

840
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,400
 - No, she's very principled.

841
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,480
 She didn't believe in selling out and things like that.

842
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,080
 She just wanted to be herself.

843
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,840
 - I'm sure, definitely merch.

844
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,680
 There must have been merch.

845
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,000
 - Actually, there's just shed loads of merch, yeah.

846
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,280
 Her images, she was on a stamp,

847
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,440
 which her painting is everywhere

848
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,720
 if you go to train stations in India.

849
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,200
 And this is up in Rajasthan in an actual park.

850
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,040
 - Oh, is she painted?

851
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:38,880
 Okay, yeah.

852
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,880
 - Yeah, it's impressive.

853
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,720
 It's mostly paw prints, but it's impressive nonetheless.

854
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,680
 - And she was the most photographed tiger

855
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,840
 in the world as well.

856
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,440
 - That's pretty amazing, isn't it?

857
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,440
 - Yeah, she had an amazing funeral

858
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,800
 because she was so kind of worshipped.

859
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,200
 So, in fact, all, I didn't realize this,

860
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,000
 all leopards and tigers are cremated in India

861
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,560
 when they die, or in international parks like this.

862
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,680
 And that is so that their skins can't be taken

863
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,680
 and sold on the black market,

864
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,400
 'cause obviously that encourages that.

865
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,040
 But, so she was cremated.

866
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,480
 But first, it's very cool, and there's a video of this.

867
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,560
 She was given a traditional Hindu funeral.

868
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,100
 So she was wrapped up in white linen,

869
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,120
 and you can just see her little head, quite big head,

870
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:18,960
 poking out above it,

871
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,240
 and then covered in lovely red flowers,

872
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,880
 and then carried on a kind of a funeral beer

873
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,760
 by lots of the park guards to this, to this pire.

874
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,600
 - That's amazing, so cool.

875
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,000
 - Yeah, it's quite a beautiful ceremony.

876
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,920
 - Yeah.

877
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,280
 Can I tell you, there's just a random tiger fact

878
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,360
 that I found quite cool.

879
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:40,280
 So, the MGM, the movies, right at the beginning,

880
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:44,120
 you've got the big lion that's through the thing, big roar.

881
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,760
 So, in the 80s, there was a sound designer

882
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,280
 called Mike Mangini,

883
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:54,000
 who was working on ambient sounds for the movie "Poltergeist."

884
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,840
 And while he was doing it,

885
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,520
 he collected a lot of different sounds,

886
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,200
 including tiger sounds.

887
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,800
 And he sent that to the people at MGM saying,

888
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,080
 have a listen to these roars,

889
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,400
 'cause they're really quite more striking

890
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,200
 than you have for your current lion

891
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,160
 that is doing the MGM roar.

892
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,640
 So, when you hear that roar at the beginning of a movie,

893
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,240
 the lion is lip-syncing.

894
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,560
 It's a tiger's roar, it's not a lion's roar.

895
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,520
 Lions apparently don't have quite that boomy,

896
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,200
 amazing roar that a tiger has, so yeah.

897
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,040
 So, it's dope.

898
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,880
 - Interesting.

899
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,200
 Another Hollywood tiger would be Mike Tyson's tigers.

900
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,040
 - Oh yeah.

901
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,880
 - He used to have tigers.

902
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,840
 Is it in the hangover, he has some tigers,

903
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,360
 but that's actually in real life he used to have tigers.

904
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,640
 He doesn't have them anymore.

905
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,000
 Any ideas why he doesn't have them anymore?

906
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,840
 - Did they escape?

907
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,600
 - They did not escape, no.

908
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,040
 - Did he beat them up?

909
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,520
 - It's illegal to have tigers,

910
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,920
 and he shouldn't have put them in the movie

911
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,040
 'cause that told everyone he had them.

912
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,880
 - Sadly, quite legal to have tigers

913
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,880
 in some parts of America.

914
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,720
 - Oh, is it, okay.

915
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,760
 - And he didn't beat them up, Anna, no.

916
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,680
 It's because they smell so much and fart so much.

917
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,520
 - Really?

918
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,920
 - Apparently, he got married,

919
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,600
 and his wife didn't want them in the house

920
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,920
 because when they fart, they smell like hell.

921
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,000
 - Right, and now the tigers are gone.

922
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,160
 She's like, "Why is that smell still here, Mike?

923
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,480
 "What?"

924
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,360
 - And there's tiger that we're talking about

925
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,600
 at the start, muchly, right?

926
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,040
 So she was blind in one eye,

927
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:19,560
 and I thought I'd look at kind of tiger opticians,

928
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,240
 and I found one.

929
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,080
 There is a person who is a tiger optician,

930
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,040
 a veterinarian, really, Tammy Miller,

931
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,840
 and she says there is one big problem

932
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,080
 with doing optician stuff on big cats.

933
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,360
 Can you think of what that might be?

934
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:38,400
 - They're massive tigers, and they'll eat your face.

935
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,920
 - A bit of that, but there's something else.

936
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:45,360
 - Ooh, they can't administer medicine to themselves.

937
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,680
 - They can't put contact lenses in.

938
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,040
 You scratch your eyes.

939
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,680
 - These are all great answers.

940
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,520
 According to her, the big problem

941
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:55,320
 is that they really hold a grudge, and so...

942
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,080
 - How are we gonna work that out?

943
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,360
 - Oh, wow.

944
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,480
 - How did you not get that out of that, come on?

945
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:05,160
 And the thing was, is basically when you do the work on them,

946
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,000
 it's obviously not very pleasant for them,

947
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,960
 but then later on you need to go and do a bit more work on them,

948
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,080
 and they are not happy.

949
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:14,080
 They remember what you did, and they will not let you near them.

950
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:14,920
 But what I thought is,

951
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,040
 do you know that there's a kid's story

952
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,880
 about the lion who gets a thorn in the paw,

953
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,360
 and then you help them,

954
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,920
 and then they're always your friend forever?

955
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,760
 Not realistic.

956
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,200
 - No, okay.

957
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,720
 - Yeah, why aren't they grateful?

958
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,160
 - They can see again.

959
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,040
 - I thought you meant, when you said,

960
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,480
 and then the next time you see them,

961
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,520
 I thought you meant the grudge extended to them,

962
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,440
 sort of like sitting in cafes with coats

963
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,240
 on trying to get back at you,

964
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,960
 like they're tracking you down, but no, it's...

965
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,640
 - No, it's just the next time they see you.

966
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,360
 And this was, it was a time when they did some work

967
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,120
 on a big cat called Indira,

968
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,920
 and that basically they anesthetized them and did this work.

969
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,000
 But when you anesthetize one of these cats,

970
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,200
 then you obviously have to do quite a lot of work on them

971
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,040
 at the same time.

972
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,960
 You might as well, 'cause it's quite dangerous

973
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,320
 to anesthetize these animals,

974
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,520
 so you might as well do as much as possible.

975
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,160
 I just say that because I really liked it

976
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:09,440
 because they did an MRI, an ultrasound, and a cat scan.

977
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,280
 - Nice.

978
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,800
 (laughing)

979
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,040
 - Listen, we need to move on to our final fact.

980
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,200
 It is time for our final fact of the show,

981
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,720
 and that is my fact.

982
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:22,040
 My fact this week is that St. Michael's Church in Bournemouth

983
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:26,000
 has been renamed St. Mike's to make it seem

984
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,160
 younger and cooler.

985
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,240
 (laughing)

986
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,760
 So this is a genuine thing.

987
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,880
 We're playing live in pool tonight.

988
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,640
 Bournemouth is just down the road,

989
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:40,080
 and it's a 148 year old church.

990
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:44,400
 The Reverend Sarah Yetman believes that by changing the name,

991
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:48,400
 it's gonna be, you know, a nice hipper place to have

992
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,760
 groovy kids come in, listen to their record players.

993
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,600
 - Is it working?

994
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,680
 Do we think, I mean, Mike isn't that cool a name anyway.

995
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,920
 I mean, apologies to any mikes in the audience.

996
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,960
 It doesn't feel like it's one of the top 10 names these days.

997
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,840
 - No, I mean, but I guess it is just shorter than Michael.

998
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,760
 It's not like, you know, St. Dave's.

999
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,920
 I think it's a bit hard to just change saints all together.

1000
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,360
 I wonder if this is gonna stick,

1001
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,320
 'cause there has been backlash with people saying,

1002
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,840
 come on, we can't start, you know,

1003
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,440
 St. David's can't be St. Dave's.

1004
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,800
 We can't suddenly just change the names of saints

1005
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,640
 of our churches.

1006
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,480
 - Where does it end?

1007
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,320
 - It's a slippery slope.

1008
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,960
 You'll have St. Twat's wagon that people go to worship in.

1009
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,120
 - It's a Twat's wagon.

1010
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:31,080
 - Oh God, it's, where does it end?

1011
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,000
 - He's in the Apocrypha.

1012
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,400
 He's not one of the main 12, but he is there, yeah.

1013
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,040
 St. Jude, I guess for St. Judas,

1014
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,480
 probably actually there isn't a St. Judas there.

1015
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,320
 - There isn't a Judas there, isn't it?

1016
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,160
 - There were two Judases, weren't there?

1017
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,000
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1018
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,840
 - Great.

1019
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,680
 - Like when you do get St. Jude's?

1020
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:48,720
 - Yeah, but not St. Twat's, I think we could all agree.

1021
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,720
 - Yeah.

1022
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,840
 - I don't mind it changing its name, I have to say.

1023
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,160
 It's had a refurbishment.

1024
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,640
 They've opened up a coffee bar as part of that

1025
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,000
 to offer a school drop off and so, you know,

1026
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 get the kids in and so on.

1027
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,960
 I don't know, it's funny though.

1028
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,800
 It is, yeah.

1029
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,640
 - Yeah, it's really cool.

1030
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,640
 I think it's great when churches do this.

1031
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,920
 And there's a big push, although there always has been

1032
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,760
 from the church to try and rejuvenate itself.

1033
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,280
 And I think there was a building,

1034
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,080
 a church building review group in 2016,

1035
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,760
 which is looking at all these big stone,

1036
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,120
 like beautiful edifices we have,

1037
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:22,200
 which are empty just all the time these days.

1038
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,880
 And it was looking at how to repurpose them.

1039
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,920
 And so now you get cool stuff,

1040
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,240
 like St. Paul's Church in Bristol is now a circus school.

1041
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,400
 And if you look at pictures of it,

1042
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,560
 it's got like trapeze-wise and high-wise hung from the ceiling

1043
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,200
 and people swinging all around it.

1044
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,040
 - Wow.

1045
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:36,880
 - It's great.

1046
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,320
 There's about a dozen churches that are chomping sites.

1047
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,160
 - Whating?

1048
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,000
 - Chomping.

1049
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,840
 - Church camping.

1050
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,160
 - Oh my God.

1051
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,400
 - I've camped in a church.

1052
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,240
 - Have you?

1053
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,080
 - Yeah.

1054
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:46,920
 - How come?

1055
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,760
 - Yeah, a church hall.

1056
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,600
 - Really?

1057
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,920
 - For a fortnight when I was 17.

1058
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,440
 - Two weeks in a church?

1059
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,280
 - Yeah.

1060
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,760
 - Your parents really didn't get along with you today.

1061
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,360
 (laughing)

1062
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,760
 - What, for any reason or?

1063
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,400
 - It was for, we were doing some sort of volunteering thing

1064
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,440
 and you had to go and live in the church

1065
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,080
 and then take out the kids of the parish during the week.

1066
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,720
 - I did once sleep in a church in Northumberland.

1067
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,560
 I must say, yeah.

1068
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,080
 I was, we'd gone, we went on a walk

1069
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,120
 'cause I went to a Catholic school.

1070
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:16,040
 We went on a walk and then we went to this little village

1071
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,240
 in Northumberland and we decided to play football

1072
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,120
 against these kids and they were so much rougher than us.

1073
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,600
 And basically it turned into a massive fight

1074
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,080
 and when I say fight, it was them trying to beat us up

1075
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,960
 and we legged it into the local church.

1076
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,480
 It went, sanctuary, sanctuary.

1077
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,640
 (laughing)

1078
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:36,680
 - Did they tell you to piss off and fight the kids?

1079
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,120
 - We stayed in there overnight.

1080
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:38,960
 - Oh, that's nice.

1081
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,800
 - Oh my God.

1082
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,760
 - That's cool.

1083
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,760
 Anyone else slept in a church or no?

1084
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,440
 - No, not slept in a church.

1085
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,960
 - I probably nodded off in a few church services.

1086
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,800
 - Yeah.

1087
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,120
 - That counts.

1088
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,200
 - Have you heard of Stony Fort Community Church

1089
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,160
 in South Carolina?

1090
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,220
 - I don't believe so.

1091
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:56,120
 - It would be staggering if you had.

1092
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,720
 These, I love these guys so much.

1093
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,880
 They have also changed their name.

1094
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,840
 They're a church.

1095
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:04,840
 And until 2020, they were called Outbreak Church

1096
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,920
 and then they found themselves think,

1097
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,040
 and it was set up in 2013.

1098
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,240
 The vicar called Scott Carroll

1099
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,760
 articulated his mission as follows.

1100
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,440
 He said, "I want to be around people

1101
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,440
 "who are so infected with Jesus

1102
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,020
 "that every time they turn around, they sneeze Jesus."

1103
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,360
 And sneezes.

1104
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,200
 - Yes.

1105
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,240
 - Sneezes Christ.

1106
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,720
 Every time they talked about the church,

1107
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,920
 they talked about contagion and infection and epidemic,

1108
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,480
 they made bracelets and shirts with the phrase,

1109
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,960
 "Are you contagious?"

1110
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,120
 And people would read them and say,

1111
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,040
 "Contagious with what?"

1112
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,480
 And they'd say, "Jesus."

1113
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:41,200
 And he says, "This was really fun

1114
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,800
 "until for some reason, early 2020, stop being funny."

1115
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,800
 (audience laughing)

1116
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,600
 - I was having a look at the Reverend Richard Coles'

1117
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,280
 autobiography, a biography.

1118
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,000
 And he was saying, it was just a throwaway line

1119
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 that I then looked into.

1120
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,640
 He was saying that a lot of vicar's have funny names

1121
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,080
 and he was saying he knew someone who insisted on everyone,

1122
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:07,160
 even bishops, calling them the Reverend Gazz.

1123
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,000
 And so then I thought,

1124
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,280
 "I wonder what funny names there have been

1125
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,800
 "in the church over the years?"

1126
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,040
 There's this blog, the blog of St. Chrysostom's Church

1127
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:17,120
 in Manchester, and it's really good.

1128
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,520
 Do you know when people put proper effort

1129
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,440
 into quite an obscure thing?

1130
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,680
 And there's a piece on funny names of church leaders

1131
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,600
 throughout history, and there are some such good ones.

1132
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,160
 So I like this anecdote, which is Henry Joy Fiennes-Clinton,

1133
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,640
 who was a rector in the early 20th century,

1134
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,200
 who went to see the Bishop of London

1135
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,520
 and the bishop said, "Take a chair, Clinton,"

1136
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,560
 to which he replied, "It's Fiennes-Clinton."

1137
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,360
 And the bishop said, "In that case, take two."

1138
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:44,560
 And so it's just, I think, a little funny from a bishop.

1139
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,560
 (laughing)

1140
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,880
 - Come on, it's over! - It's Bishop Humor.

1141
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,120
 It's Bishop Humor, yeah.

1142
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,720
 - Okay, we won't get him on the podcast.

1143
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,360
 It's just, this is his audition tape, and I thought...

1144
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,880
 - Oh, no, come on, give us more zingers.

1145
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,920
 - Right, wow. (laughing)

1146
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,560
 - Okay, okay, what about this?

1147
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,640
 The very Reverend Gonville-Obey French Baytag,

1148
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,800
 but French is spelled with a small F and two of them.

1149
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,640
 (laughing)

1150
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,480
 - What's going on?

1151
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,400
 - Is that important for the anecdote?

1152
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,240
 - There's no anecdote. - That's it, that's it.

1153
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,360
 - That's it? - That's just the thing.

1154
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:19,080
 - It's just the word French spelled slightly differently.

1155
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,720
 No, Anna, we want you to tell us

1156
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,320
 every single one you've found.

1157
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,360
 (laughing)

1158
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,520
 - This is literally all I've got now.

1159
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,520
 This is not very amusing names.

1160
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,920
 Okay, Father John, Brabazan, Brabazan, Loutha?

1161
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,760
 Come on!

1162
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,840
 - It's two Brabazans.

1163
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,480
 - Brabazan, Brabazan?

1164
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:38,720
 - Oh my God, I'm just picturing Jimmy Carr

1165
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,960
 at the Hammersmith Apollo.

1166
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,000
 Your next act is a fucking killer act.

1167
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,520
 She's got some amazing anecdotes.

1168
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,160
 Anna Tashinsky, everybody.

1169
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,480
 (laughing)

1170
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,040
 (humming)

1171
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:50,880
 - Woo!

1172
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,360
 We've got Father Page Turner.

1173
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,040
 We've got Father Pickles.

1174
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:57,040
 - Page Turner, open with Page Turner.

1175
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,160
 (laughing)

1176
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,000
 That's great.

1177
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,080
 Father Pickles is funny as well.

1178
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,080
 - I'll reorder the set.

1179
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,880
 Father Careful, Father Christmas.

1180
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,560
 - Okay! - Let's go.

1181
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,320
 - So that's the one I should stick with,

1182
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,160
 Father Christmas.

1183
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,320
 - I don't think stick with any of it, but, you know,

1184
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,760
 have you guys heard of St. Andrew Undershaft?

1185
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,880
 (laughing)

1186
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,960
 - I can't believe, you just said a name way funnier

1187
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,520
 than Anna's 20 days.

1188
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,680
 (laughing)

1189
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,720
 - Upstage the full day of work.

1190
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,880
 - I'm so sorry.

1191
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,200
 - I've been delving into church.

1192
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,840
 - I'm so sorry, this is right under your nose

1193
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,280
 the whole time.

1194
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,680
 St. Andrew Undershaft is a church in London,

1195
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,720
 and it was literally under a massive shaft.

1196
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,920
 That's the reason it was named like that.

1197
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,760
 - It was a massive maypole, a huge maypole.

1198
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,320
 I was, this is the 16th century, gigantic maypole.

1199
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,280
 Can't stress how big this maypole was.

1200
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,720
 And it was there every year around May Day

1201
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:52,600
 until an event in 1517 called the Evil May Day Riots.

1202
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,440
 - Ooh.

1203
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,600
 - Which I had never heard of before.

1204
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,360
 And they were these huge riots.

1205
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,120
 They were huge anti-foreigner riots,

1206
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,560
 so they weren't very funny.

1207
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,080
 But the may, so the maypole was--

1208
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:02,920
 - I'll put them in my set.

1209
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,000
 (laughing)

1210
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,920
 - The maypole was toppled.

1211
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,360
 The maypole had to fall.

1212
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,440
 And it was then preserved in a house

1213
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,200
 on nearby Shaft Alley.

1214
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,880
 But the maypole itself was then destroyed in 1549

1215
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,280
 as a pagan idol.

1216
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,280
 So, yeah.

1217
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,400
 But the church St. Andrew Undershaft,

1218
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,360
 500 years later nearly, still has its name.

1219
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,280
 - Yeah, cool. - Nice.

1220
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,800
 - I'm so sorry that I need to do this,

1221
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,760
 but it's bugging me.

1222
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,080
 So why was the double F thing funny?

1223
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,520
 (laughing)

1224
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,800
 - Tell us the name again, Anna.

1225
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,640
 - Right.

1226
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:41,640
 The very reverend Gonville-Obey French Baytag,

1227
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:45,360
 but French is spelled with a small F.

1228
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,200
 - Yeah.

1229
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,320
 - And two of them.

1230
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,360
 (laughing)

1231
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,800
 - I'm now finding it funny.

1232
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,040
 I think I've gone through the unfunniness.

1233
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:53,880
 (laughing)

1234
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,000
 I'm finding it funny again.

1235
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,360
 - I find it so funny that there's two Fs in the word funny.

1236
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,200
 (laughing)

1237
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,840
 And they're both lowercase.

1238
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,840
 (laughing)

1239
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,480
 - I got told the thing by a very good friend of ours,

1240
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:08,120
 Jason Haisley, who is a friend of the podcast.

1241
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,480
 He's been on it a couple of times.

1242
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:13,400
 And we mentioned a fact quite a long time ago,

1243
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,640
 which is, and it was about 50-odd episodes ago,

1244
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:18,280
 which is that flying saucer suites

1245
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:21,000
 are made by this Belgium company, Belgica.

1246
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,060
 And they are the same people

1247
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:24,800
 who make the communion wafers.

1248
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,920
 And when Christianity was declining a bit,

1249
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,880
 it meant that they had a lot of spare wafers.

1250
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,640
 And so it's the flying saucers

1251
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,800
 that are made out of Jesus,

1252
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,680
 of Jesus's body is the flying.

1253
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:37,880
 - Oh, Christianity, I thought you said Christianity.

1254
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,440
 I thought you were trying for another funny name.

1255
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,400
 (laughing)

1256
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,720
 - Anna, please, no, please not Reverend Christianity.

1257
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:46,200
 (laughing)

1258
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,160
 Too boring.

1259
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,200
 - If it was Christianity, that would be pretty good.

1260
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,960
 (laughing)

1261
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,320
 - I just misheard again.

1262
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,340
 I thought, I don't want to raise it

1263
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:58,340
 because he's a really famous guy.

1264
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:00,520
 And I know no one else has heard of it.

1265
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,440
 Sorry, Christianity was declining.

1266
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,880
 - Yeah, so flying saucer suites

1267
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:06,440
 are basically communion wafers, that's the thing.

1268
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:09,200
 So Jason was listening to our podcast,

1269
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,800
 absolutely blown away by it.

1270
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,440
 And he messaged his friend who was a vicar

1271
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,440
 and he told her this story

1272
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,280
 and he said it blew her mind as well.

1273
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,280
 And then he said, she went, oh my God, hang on.

1274
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,600
 She said that when she was in training as a vicar

1275
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:25,320
 because communion wafers, or hosts as they're properly known,

1276
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,480
 are the literal body of Christ,

1277
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:30,000
 trainees don't use genuine communion wafers,

1278
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,960
 they use flying saucers.

1279
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,080
 And so by accident, they're accidentally using this.

1280
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,560
 And I know James, I think you said

1281
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:38,840
 that this doesn't feel right.

1282
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:41,160
 So I think it's like particular to her story.

1283
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,640
 - Yeah, I mean, well, like we always do

1284
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,080
 when people send us stuff like this,

1285
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,040
 we go into a massive amount of detail

1286
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,000
 and I emailed all the reverends and vickers

1287
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,560
 and priests that I knew.

1288
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,600
 And they reckon that until transubstantiation for them,

1289
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,680
 it isn't the body of Christ, so they wouldn't do that.

1290
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,040
 But that's not to say this person didn't.

1291
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,840
 - Yeah, yeah, exactly.

1292
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,200
 Can you do it, 'cause they're flying saucers,

1293
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,560
 can you do it from a distance?

1294
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,240
 (laughing)

1295
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,680
 - 'Cause I think I would start going to church

1296
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,760
 if someone threw a flying saucer into my mouth.

1297
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:07,600
 - That's true.

1298
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,120
 - And then you'd just be jumping up like a dog

1299
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:09,960
 to try and catch it.

1300
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:10,800
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1301
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:11,640
 - That'd be cool.

1302
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,520
 - If you did it like how they do in the bouquet at a wedding,

1303
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,160
 who's gonna get body of Christ this week?

1304
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,160
 (laughing)

1305
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,320
 Who's going to heaven?

1306
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,280
 - It's one of you.

1307
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,720
 (laughing)

1308
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,360
 We're gonna have to wrap up in a sec, guys.

1309
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,640
 - Oh, is there no time for us and more names?

1310
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,160
 - Oh, okay, I'm so glad you've asked.

1311
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,560
 Ryan McGvicker?

1312
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,520
 - I can't believe you've got more.

1313
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:31,360
 (laughing)

1314
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,440
 - Ryan McGvicker is great.

1315
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,280
 (laughing)

1316
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,120
 - Yeah, that is good.

1317
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:38,360
 - My god, are you pissing around with the French guy?

1318
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,000
 When you had Ryan McGvicker tucked all the way up your sleeve?

1319
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,000
 - I still think F-F-F-F-F-F-F-French is the best.

1320
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,120
 - Maybe, maybe.

1321
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:48,160
 - Can I just, on churches reinventing themselves,

1322
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,680
 there is a church that's shaped like a high-heeled shoe

1323
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:53,400
 in Taiwan, which has the Guinness record

1324
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,880
 for the largest high-heeled shoe shape structure.

1325
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,640
 And it was built in 2016.

1326
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,360
 It's actually a wedding venue,

1327
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,960
 so it's not ordained by God.

1328
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,680
 It's like a wedding church.

1329
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,640
 But it was built to attract women.

1330
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,480
 And the Taiwanese government said

1331
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:10,600
 there will be a hundred female-oriented features inside,

1332
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:14,200
 like maple leaves, chairs for lovers,

1333
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,240
 with biscuits and cakes.

1334
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,080
 - Women.

1335
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,000
 (laughing)

1336
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,520
 - That's, and it's so weird.

1337
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:23,040
 It's inspired by the story of a girl in the 1960s

1338
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,640
 who got Blackfoot disease,

1339
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,480
 had both of her legs amputated,

1340
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,480
 and her groom canceled her wedding.

1341
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,680
 So it's in honor of her, which I actually think

1342
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:31,520
 is quite offensive.

1343
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,040
 - They made the church shape like a shoe.

1344
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:33,880
 - Yes.

1345
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,520
 (laughing)

1346
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,840
 - Not sure that's okay.

1347
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:39,400
 Wow, those female things.

1348
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:42,120
 I didn't know that women like maple leaves so much.

1349
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:42,960
 - Oh my God, it's what we talk about.

1350
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:43,800
 - It's great.

1351
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,200
 Actually, every time I get home from a tour gig,

1352
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,280
 the house is full of maple leaves and it's a nightmare.

1353
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,160
 - Well, you mean the ice hockey team.

1354
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,520
 (laughing)

1355
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,000
 - Oh yeah.

1356
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,840
 - Well, they do your house when you've been away on tar.

1357
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:55,680
 - I don't know.

1358
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,160
 I'm gonna ask some questions when I get back this time.

1359
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,640
 - In 2019, have you guys heard of the company

1360
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,640
 called the Christian Book Depository?

1361
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:03,800
 - No.

1362
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:04,760
 - Yes, I think so.

1363
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,080
 - Yeah, so the Christian Book Depository,

1364
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,520
 they complained in 2019

1365
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:11,040
 'cause they kept getting phone calls like this.

1366
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,200
 A person would call up and say,

1367
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,000
 "Hey, I'm looking for my order."

1368
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,280
 And they're like, "What did you order?"

1369
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,000
 He says, "I ordered gummies."

1370
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,600
 And they went, "Ah, right, you're not in the right place."

1371
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:24,200
 And it turns out that their website, cbd.com,

1372
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,120
 who is attracting the wrong kind of people.

1373
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:29,120
 (laughing)

1374
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:32,200
 So they've changed their name to Christian Book.

1375
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,040
 - That's great.

1376
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,920
 - Christian Book, that'll be a great name for a vicar.

1377
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:37,560
 (laughing)

1378
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,000
 - Look, we need to wrap up, guys.

1379
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,520
 Okay, that is it.

1380
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:41,880
 That is all of our facts.

1381
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,520
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,520

00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:01,600
 - Yes.

1394
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:02,440
 - Right in.

1395
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:03,600
 - Get in, yes.

1396

 Yep, or you can go to our website,

1398

 That's fish with one F.

1399
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,280
 (laughing)

1400
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,440
 (audience applauding)

1401
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:18,400
 - And we thank you so much, Paul.

1402
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,080
 We've had so much fun here tonight.
