00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:17.040
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.840
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.540
 coming to you live from Paul.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.540
 (audience cheering)

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.300
 (audience cheering)

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.500
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.940
 with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.980
 and James Harkin, and once again,

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.780
 we have gathered round the microphones

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.100
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.300
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.540
 Starting with fact number one, and that is James.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.360
 - My fact this week is that tardy grades

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.580
 can survive being shot out of a gun,

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.500
 but they're a bit groggy afterwards.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.380
 - Tardy grades.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.460
 - Tardy grades, yes.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.860
 Tiny little things, not quite microscopic,

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.420
 you can see them if you look really, really carefully,

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.420
 but very, very small little things.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.300
 Living in all over the world,

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.020
 probably some in your garden,

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.980
 probably some on this stage, no, they're not on this stage.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.860
 They live in like moss and in bits of grass

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.340
 and stuff like that.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.260
 They're really, really strong, powerful things.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.500
 You can't kill them.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.340
 Virtually nothing will kill them.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.200
 - They're not powerful, like they can't put a lorry.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.940
 They're not going to be able to give you a piggyback.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.940
 - If you go enough of them, I reckon, what do you reckon?

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.020
 - I think it's enough of anything, you can put a lorry.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.060
 - We don't need them to put a lorry,

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.580
 we just need them to drive a lorry.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.100
 (laughing)

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.180
 - Apparently scientists, I read,

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.780
 can't work out a scenario in which they would go extinct

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.860
 prior to the actual explosion of the sun, basically.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:47.700
 Like the end--

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.340
 - Well the explosion of the sun might not kill them either.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.180
 - What?

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.060
 - So basically they can survive in space,

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.000
 they can survive really, really hot temperatures,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.180
 really, really cold temperatures,

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.100
 they can survive loads of radiation.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.940
 If they get in trouble,

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.820
 they just kind of shut their bodies down

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.700
 and then kind of get rid of all the water

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.940
 and you put a bit of water back on them

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.700
 and they come back alive again.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.580
 And what has happened is some of these tardigrades

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.900
 have been sent up into space onto the moon

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.740
 and they've crashed into the moon.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.060
 And people are wondering maybe they're alive

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.380
 and maybe they're actually living there on the moon.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.860
 And so these people,

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.340
 this was a woman called Alejandra Tresbas

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.400
 from Queen Mary University in London.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.640
 She did this experiment to see if they might still be alive.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.360
 And so what she did is she put them in a gun,

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.720
 shot them at a wall and saw how they were, basically.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.560
 - Wow.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.280
 - And they could survive impacts of up to a kilometer

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.720
 per second, that's 2,000 miles an hour,

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.960
 they could survive.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.560
 And shot pressures of up to 1.14 gigapascals,

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.920
 which I know out of context doesn't really mean anything,

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.160
 but it's a lot, I promise you it's a lot.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.720
 - So there's life in the universe now,

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.400
 outside of Earth, in theory.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.900
 We haven't yet confirmed it, but we know.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:53.740
 - Awesome.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:54.580
 - If can I just check?

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.780
 Can I just ask how the groggyness exhibited itself?

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.140
 I think we need to address this.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.980
 - Oh yeah, yeah.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:59.820
 - Okay, yeah.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.380
 So tardigrades are the smallest animal that have legs.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.500
 They have these little legs that they crawl around with

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.220
 and they kind of have like a very specific gait

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.540
 and as they go quicker, they change the gait.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.140
 But these ones, they kind of sort of staggered around

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.420
 a little bit when they kind of pull them back.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.940
 But the problem with what you were saying, Dan,

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.220
 is the shot pressure that they've worked out

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.480
 that there would have been on the moon

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.360
 would have been greater than this 1.14 gigapascals.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.920
 So we think that the ones on the moon

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.660
 probably are not alive.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.400
 - Very disappointingly, yeah.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.160
 So when scientists say we can't work out how to kill them,

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.360
 shoot them as the bullet of the gun.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.200
 - We can work out how to,

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.600
 there are lots of ways you can kill them.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.960
 - Yeah, you can just stamp on them.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:40.800
 - Can you?

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.840
 - Yeah, they're actually really easy to kill.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.520
 Okay, I'm here to give you the disappointing truth

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.280
 about tardigrades because they've ruled the internet

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.540
 is too long.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.440
 A, there are plenty of ways to kill them.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.040
 B, the whole, they can withstand massive temperatures.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.920
 They actually just did an experiment

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.100
 where they realized they can't withstand temperatures

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.480
 for very long at all.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.200
 And scientists now reckon that climate change

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.760
 is gonna kill them before it kills us.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:03.600
 - No.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.140
 - So the thing is, they can survive being boiled,

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.000
 but only if it happens quite quickly.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.020
 And then they get back to a nice, normal temperature again.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.100
 But they didn't experiment recently where--

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.140
 - It feels harsh that you're criticizing them

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.120
 for not being able to withstand indefinite boiling.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.120
 I think it's impressive.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.160
 If I boiled an egg and then a few minutes later

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.000
 it came out of the pan

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.080
 and it was still in its egg, raw egg state,

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.920
 I'd be impressed.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.040
 - I turned it to a chicken.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.280
 - Exactly.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.920
 - I'm not demanding indefinite.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.160
 I just think a couple of hours would be good.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.800
 And they can't even survive, for instance,

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.200
 like above 37 degrees for 24 hours,

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.680
 half of tardigrades die,

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.560
 straight like within that amount of time.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.000
 So, you know, any longer than that and then they all die.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.100
 If you put them at 63 degrees,

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.580
 half of them are gone within like much shorter than that.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.220
 And I think if you're in the 80s,

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.620
 then they don't last an hour.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:53.460
 - Yeah.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.300
 Oh, I see, sorry.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.500
 - Not the 1980s. - The 1980s, yeah.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.860
 - Amazing they made it through that decade.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.180
 It was a horrible decade for them.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.020
 - Oh, the music.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.100
 - They are crushed by a Rubik's cube.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.380
 I don't think they are shit.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.220
 - What?

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.820
 - Well, I'm gonna stand up for tardigrades.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.580
 - They do this thing, tardigrades do this thing.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.140
 It's seeding the world on its own.

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.460
 So it can get picked up by the wind.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.360
 It can get carried in the wind, land wherever,

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.120
 and then wherever it lands,

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.800
 it can just reproduce asexually.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.880
 It doesn't need a partner.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.480
 You could send it to the moon, just one,

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.960
 and it'll be like, that's cool, I'll set up a colony.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.400
 Like it's a phenomenal little creature.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.680
 - And the confusing thing about that,

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.080
 'cause there are obviously lots of organisms

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.840
 that can reproduce asexually,

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.360
 but it's quite confusing that they've managed

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.040
 to evolve successfully, right?

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.560
 Because asexual reproduction,

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.080
 it's supposed to be a bit of a disadvantage

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.720
 'cause you're only getting your own genes

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:42.560
 over and over again.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.760
 You can't improve.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.500
 - And so how have they managed to do this?

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.040
 - They have sex too.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.380
 They do also have sex under normal circumstances

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.500
 if they can find another of the opposite sex.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.060
 And it's a very romantic process actually.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.020
 Tardigrade mating is very fascinating.

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.320
 So here we go.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.160
 Step one.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.200
 - You've already killed any set of robots.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.540
 - Why don't you do it in like a Craig David style?

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.820
 What would you do on a Monday?

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.440
 - On a Monday, the female would shed her outer skin

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.080
 and lay her eggs inside it.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.600
 - Keep talking to me.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.440
 Yes.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.600
 - Okay, on a Tuesday?

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.960
 - A Tuesday, the male would then arrive

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.880
 and get into position and then fertilize the eggs,

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:25.960
 which are--

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:26.800
 - Wait, wait, wait.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.120
 That's making love on Thursday and Friday and Saturday.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.640
 - Oh, Tuesday Wednesday is waiting.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.320
 And then, when the male arrives,

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.000
 so the male basically fertilizes the female's eggs,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.760
 which are outside her body,

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.440
 but they're still inside the shed exoskeleton

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.700
 that she has cast off.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.380
 - But the thing about what she does with the skeleton

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:45.980
 is she doesn't get out of it.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:46.820
 It's a bit like she takes--

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:47.940
 - No, she's still inside, she's--

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.380
 - Yeah, so she sheds it,

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.060
 but it's like taking your arms out of a coat,

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:52.780
 but keeping it around you.

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.620
 - It's like a much more disgusting version of doing that.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:55.460
 - Yes.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:56.300
 - Right, yeah.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.820
 And then the male has sex with the coat is what we say.

00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:59.660
 - Yes.

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:00.500
 (laughing)

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.860
 - Yes, exactly.

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:02.700
 - Wow.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.220
 - The male has sex in between the coat and you.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:06.540
 (laughing)

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.020
 - And then you just chill on Sunday, yeah.

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:09.860
 (laughing)

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.800
 - The good thing is, they do it to the face,

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.640
 but it ends up around the back.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.300
 And this scientists don't understand

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:19.140
 how this works yet.

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:19.980
 - I don't understand what you're saying.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:24.820
 - Right, so if you picture their sexual position,

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:29.820
 the male curls himself around the female's face.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:33.080
 Okay, so his crotch is in her face.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.240
 Her face is buried in his crotch.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.400
 And then she does these weird sucking motions

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.740
 with her throat, which kind of stimulates.

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:41.580
 - Oh my God.

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.620
 - This genuinely happens, and it is quite romantic.

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.300
 - Mr. David, I think we're gonna need to rewrite

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:46.420
 us some of these lyrics.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:49.180
 (laughing)

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:50.460
 - She doesn't see sucking motions.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:52.420
 It's a full hour of foreplay.

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:53.260
 - Wow.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:54.900
 - Kind of unbelievable for these tiny creatures.

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:57.100
 And then he ejaculates multiple times.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:58.620
 Impressive, guys, take note.

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:02.180
 But then he ejaculates under the skin,

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:05.000
 but then her eggs come out the back, her cloaca.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.760
 So we don't really know how the sperm

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:09.780
 is climbing all the way around to get to the eggs.

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.860
 - And what happens to the coats, though, I don't...

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:12.700
 - Yeah.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:15.700
 - Oh, I think they grow up in the coat, don't they?

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.220
 I think the eggs are fertilized,

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.420
 but they stay inside the coat, and I think that's a...

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:21.060
 - I was thinking that poor dry cleaner

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:22.300
 when you hand that in.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.060
 (laughing)

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:27.100
 - I agree, Dan, they're not shit.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:28.260
 They're not completely shit.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.180
 They're about one-third shit.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:33.060
 And that is because they can poo one-third

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:35.740
 the size of their body in a single go.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:37.840
 - Ah, like a sloth.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:38.680
 Sloths do that, don't they?

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:41.320
 - Sloths do that, do they, one-third.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.760
 - I think that baby sloths, baby sloths can be here.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.840
 - Well, it's the equivalent of me pooing out

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.640
 a large pair of speakers, a 10-year-old child,

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.300
 or an adult Dalmatian.

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.960
 (laughing)

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.140
 - A 10-year-old child?

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.240
 (laughing)

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.960
 - Is this a game of "Would You Rather?"

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.320
 (laughing)

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.120
 - I'm not sure about this 101 Dalmatians remake, actually.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.880
 I think I'd rather...

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.680
 - Wow. - Wow, that's a lot of poo.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.900
 - It's amazing, the video is good, isn't it?

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.220
 You should really watch the video of Tardigreads

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:12.620
 taking a poo, a Tardigread taking a poo,

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.940
 'cause you can feel it really trying to squeeze it out

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:15.900
 and get away from it.

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.300
 And it's enormous, I think it looks much bigger

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.460
 than a third of its body.

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.460
 - There are two of them, it's by weight, it's a third.

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.940
 There are two videos of them pooing.

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.780
 One of them, it's like really, really trying.

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:27.900
 The other one, it's finding it a lot easier,

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.060
 but the researcher who was doing that reckons it's

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:33.300
 because it was squashed between two pieces of glass,

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.700
 and maybe the squashing this helped it to send the poo out.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.600
 - Oh my gosh, it's like a fetish video then

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.440
 that you guys watched.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.040
 (laughing)

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.600
 - It's like when you massage your stomach a bit

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.560
 to help out with conservation.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:44.400
 - Just like that.

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.240
 - Exactly.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.120
 - Just like that, the Tommy Cooper cat race.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.200
 (laughing)

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.600
 Can we talk about them the way they suspend

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.720
 and then reanimate?

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:53.680
 - Okay, sure. - 'Cause it is really,

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.400
 really cool, so they, as James said,

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.560
 if their environment dries out, so they live in moss,

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:02.160
 they also get called moss piglets, which is adorable.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.000
 And if their bit of moss dries out,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.060
 then they dry out with it, as it were,

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:10.240
 and they enter a thing called cryptobiosis.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.620
 So they roll into a ball, they shrivel up,

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.540
 they're normally 85% water,

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:16.440
 that goes down to 3% water,

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.980
 so they're almost completely desiccated.

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:22.700
 But then, if you put water on them, whoop, back they come.

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:24.660
 And scientists have been testing for decades

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:26.740
 how long they can go for, and the problem is,

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:28.700
 you need a tardigrade that was dried out

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:30.740
 decades ago to experiment.

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:33.160
 - The latest experiment on this was in 1983,

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.040
 a group of Japanese scientists in Antarctica,

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:38.200
 they found and they froze a group of tardigrades,

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.260
 and 31 years later, in 2014,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.800
 they popped some water on them, and they woke up.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.120
 - Wow. - Took them about two weeks,

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.840
 but they were called SB1 and SB2

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.800
 for Sleeping Beauty One and Sleeping Beauty Two.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.360
 - Aw. - That's nice.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.840
 - And one of them, one of them,

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.360
 they both came around, one egg they had frozen also,

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.740
 hatched into a healthy tardigrade,

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.160
 which then laid its own eggs eight days later.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.200
 It's incredible the way they come back, yeah.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.820
 - But did they have lots of very dated cultural references?

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:04.780
 (laughing)

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:08.060
 - There was a story of one that was found in a museum,

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:10.420
 wasn't there, that was 100 years old,

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.140
 supposedly came back to life as well,

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:14.120
 but that's not in a paper, that's kind of anecdotal.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.180
 - It's a bit, yeah, it's an Italian scientist

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:19.820
 who said it moved its leg, and it's kind of unclear

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:21.780
 whether it moved its leg or whether he nudged it a bit,

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:24.060
 and so I, oh, look, there it is, yeah, yeah.

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:25.620
 But we're gonna have to move on to our next fact

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:26.460
 in a sec, guys.

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:30.180
 - Can I, just because I'm the anti-tardigrade on the panel,

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:32.940
 I'd like to put forward my rival to tardigrades,

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:35.280
 and that is the Deloitte rotifer,

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:38.040
 and this is another tiny creature,

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:39.800
 about the same size, maybe a tiny bit smaller,

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.400
 you could maybe, it's just on the cusp of being seeable,

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.640
 and they can do all the same stuff,

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.160
 survive unbelievable extremes,

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.640
 like massive amounts of radiation,

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.320
 huge heat being in permafrost for ages,

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.440
 much more radiation than tardigrades can survive,

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:58.720
 by the way, and they were thought to be able

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:02.700
 to last a decade frozen and completely dried out,

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.660
 and then be able to reanimate themselves,

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.260
 and scientists just found some trapped

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.180
 in Siberian permafrost, and realized they have

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:12.180
 to reassess that, and it's not a decade they can,

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:13.820
 you know, stay frozen and then come back to life,

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:15.580
 it's 24,000 years.

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.420
 - Oh, what?

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:18.260
 - No.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.500
 - Pop some water on, sprung straight back into action.

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.700
 - Those are pretty dated references, aren't they?

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:23.540
 (all laughing)

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:25.220
 It's like, oh, what about those bully mothers today?

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:27.780
 - Yeah, they sound shit.

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:28.620
 - Wow.

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:29.460
 - All right.

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:30.280
 - Not nice is it?

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:31.120
 - Not nice.

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:31.960
 (all laughing)

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:32.780
 - Yeah.

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:33.620
 Thank you.

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:35.080
 - They also, they're called Deloids,

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.920
 and they begin with, guys, what do they begin with?

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:38.760
 What letter?

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:39.580
 - D.

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:40.940
 - A B, a silent B.

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:42.000
 (all laughing)

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.460
 - You're kidding.

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:44.300
 - How brave is that?

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:47.280
 - Like, is it a leech is a Deloid, isn't it?

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:48.120
 - Is it?

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.160
 - I think so.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:50.000
 - Interesting.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.640
 - No one knows that, so that might be wrong.

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:52.560
 - Yeah.

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.640
 Anyway, we need to move on to our second fact,

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:57.680
 time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:59.620
 My fact is that, in the 1920s,

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:02.300
 Chicago was hit by a miniature crime wave

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:05.700
 of testicle theft, which was nicknamed,

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:08.380
 which was nicknamed, "Gland Larsony."

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:10.260
 (all laughing)

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:11.500
 Really impressive.

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:15.220
 - Do you think if you'd had your testicles removed

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:16.940
 and you read that newspaper article,

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:18.900
 you'd be like, ah, good one.

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:19.740
 (all laughing)

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:21.180
 Do you think they're making light

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:24.020
 of what is probably quite a horrific experience?

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:26.140
 - It sounds terrible, it sounds terrible,

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:28.240
 but it is presented as a kind of funny thing

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.640
 that happened once, and it has been a hundred years.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.360
 So, let's get into it.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.960
 Next year, it actually is the centenary,

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.640
 so I know a lot of people will probably

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.440
 be wanting to market somehow.

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.520
 - I think it's gonna be a public holiday, isn't it?

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.240
 - I think I might have a big ball.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.280
 (all laughing)

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:47.440
 - Well, one person who didn't have a big ball, James,

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.160
 once this crime wave happened to him,

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.440
 the first victim in Chicago, who's an electrician,

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:52.680
 is called Henry Johnson.

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:53.760
 He's called Johnson, huh?

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:58.100
 And he was found unconscious in the street.

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:02.020
 And he'd been out for a drink, he got into a street car,

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:03.900
 and he remembered nothing else after that,

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:05.540
 but he was quite late, he'd been out,

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:08.660
 and his testicles had gone.

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:12.100
 And he may have been chloroformed or something like this,

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:13.500
 it's kind of hazy.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.220
 He didn't report it to the police, apparently,

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:18.380
 he just went home and then went back to work.

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:19.220
 - Wow.

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:20.420
 - Really?

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:21.260
 Yeah.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:22.100
 - It was a different time,

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:23.740
 you were stoic back then, wasn't it?

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:26.060
 (all laughing)

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:27.300
 - Oh, well, these things happen.

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:28.300
 - Yeah.

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.300
 - It happened, it did happen, it happened.

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:33.620
 - It's such a hard thing to call in sick to your boss for,

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:34.460
 isn't it?

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:35.300
 (all laughing)

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.500
 I've lost my testicles.

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.220
 (all laughing)

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:40.860
 - Pull the other one, I can't.

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:43.440
 (all laughing)

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:48.840
 - The earliest report I could find on newspapers.com,

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.160
 which is like all the old American newspapers

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.400
 that we go on sometimes.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:56.300
 It was a Sioux City Journal on the 14th of October, 1922.

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.160
 Actually, it was the same report was in lots of them,

00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.720
 but this was the first one that came up.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.220
 But the next story in the newspaper was about the son

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:05.980
 of Leo Tolstoy, who had lost his family jewels.

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:06.820
 - No.

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:07.660
 (all laughing)

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:08.500
 - That is very good.

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:09.340
 - It's not cool, yeah, yeah.

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:10.180
 - That's really cool.

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:11.860
 - That's gotta be some deliberate editorial decision

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:12.700
 making there, I love that.

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:13.660
 - Here's a question, right?

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:15.640
 Do you think this actually happened?

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:18.020
 Or do you think it was a medi-uppy thing?

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:18.860
 - Oh.

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:20.460
 - It definitely became a panic.

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:21.280
 - The rock?

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:22.120
 - Yeah.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.920
 - The stories were a bit, so you were talking

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:29.640
 about Henry Johnson, and he came to explain

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:31.640
 that he was missing his testicles off the back

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.600
 of a different person first revealing it.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.360
 So it's like he didn't tell anyone, press-wise,

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:39.160
 but there was a guy called Joseph Wozniak who told,

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:40.880
 and then other people came out and said,

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.960
 "Me me too, my balls were taken."

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:45.920
 And Johnson was one of them.

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.280
 But the report that I read,

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.080
 the article that you sent round to us,

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:51.940
 it said he discovered that one or both

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:54.020
 of his testicles were missing.

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:55.860
 And that's a curious thing to say.

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:57.740
 - Was that Wozniak?

00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:59.940
 - Yeah, there were different standards

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:01.460
 of self-care back in the day.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:02.300
 - Right.

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:03.140
 - Yeah.

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:05.140
 - 'Cause I was equally confused by his story.

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:06.540
 In the article that I read about him,

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:08.380
 it said that all that happened was he woke

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:10.100
 in the streets not remembering how he got there,

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:12.100
 horrible taste in his mouth, chloroform,

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:15.460
 pain in his groin, got through the day,

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:18.100
 and then went to hospital where the doctor discovered

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:19.760
 his testicles had been removed,

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:22.140
 which I would have thought you would have realized.

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:24.520
 - But it'd be swollen, you'd be uncomfortable,

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:27.600
 maybe you might not be analyzing yourself properly.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:28.960
 - You'd be bandaged as well, right?

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:29.800
 Presumably.

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:30.860
 - Well, you bandaged.

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:32.760
 No, I think this is before he's gone to the hospital.

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.520
 - No, there's been other cases, I think,

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:38.060
 where the people who were removing the testicles

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:40.940
 bandaged up because they weren't trying to kill people.

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:42.260
 They just wanted their testicles.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.280
 - Wait, sorry, do you think you'd be so uncurious

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.480
 that if you woke up on the street

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.820
 and you had a big old bandage around your crotch,

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.480
 you'd just go, "You know what, I'm not gonna touch it.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:52.800
 "I'm not gonna touch it.

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.240
 "It's none of my business."

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.980
 (laughing)

00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:01.120
 - It kind of gets in the heart of it.

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.560
 - It's so hard to tell.

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.220
 I think it may have happened to one or two people,

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:05.300
 but not to all of them.

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:08.040
 So, for example, there was a guy who,

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.320
 a young man called John Powell.

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:12.560
 This was in 1923, there were a couple more cases of it,

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:14.840
 or certainly a ledge case in 1923,

00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:16.120
 a young man called John Powell,

00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:18.440
 who was allegedly assaulted by three men

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.720
 wearing white lab coats, who were shouting,

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:25.080
 "We need a gland," and I don't know if that is true,

00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:27.880
 but it was true that the authorities took it seriously.

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.640
 They promised to charge gland banditry,

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.800
 genuinely the phrase that was used to refer to it,

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.640
 they made it a special crime, that was the crime of mayhem.

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:37.880
 They sort of included gland banditry in the charge

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.920
 of mayhem so you could get 14 years in prison

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:43.400
 if you were found guilty of it, so there were responses.

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.760
 - I think the evidence that I could find,

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.480
 so a few things is, first of all,

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:50.000
 it's really hard to use chloroform to knock someone out.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.680
 There's technically really a difficult thing to do.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.120
 - So in movies when we see that,

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:54.960
 that takes a couple of minutes.

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.040
 - Yeah, yeah, you would need to hold it over

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.760
 for like five or 10 minutes.

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.680
 Often they would use other drugs as well.

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:02.360
 Sometimes, you know, there are ways of doing it.

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:04.720
 You'd have to know what you're doing to get the right dose.

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:05.800
 You'd have to hold their head up

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.280
 so they don't swallow their tongue.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:08.560
 So that's a bit dodgy.

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.080
 The other thing is all the articles

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.960
 warn about the dangers of liquor,

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.960
 and this was in the time of prohibition.

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.760
 So they're always saying, like,

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:19.160
 "Oh, well, maybe sobriety and early hours

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:21.320
 "would prevent much anguish for this person

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:23.280
 "who lost his testicles," stuff like that.

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:25.040
 - They're saying they were drunk.

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.200
 - They're saying that basically,

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.080
 there's prohibition happening, you shouldn't be drinking,

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.720
 but if you do drink, you might lose your bowls.

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:31.840
 So there's a bit of that there,

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:35.040
 but then one of the articles referenced a surgeon

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.400
 called Anthony Sigmund Sampolinsky,

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.520
 and I checked him and he definitely did exist.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.640
 So, you know, there was definitely some stuff there

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:43.720
 that was definitely real, so it's kind of weird.

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.440
 - I don't know. - It's a really curious one.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.760
 The theory that was launched was that it was to...

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:51.040
 This is the exact phrasing from the newspaper.

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:55.320
 It was possibly done to rejuvenate some wealthy ancient,

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:59.680
 i.e. an elderly millionaire wanted some pep.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:02.200
 - But wait a minute, but that was happening, though, wasn't it?

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.200
 - But that's the weird thing.

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.160
 That definitely was happening at the time,

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:06.360
 which lends credence to this,

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:08.320
 and maybe it was a panic off the back of the fact

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.720
 that people were going around inserting testicles

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:11.560
 into themselves.

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:13.640
 - Yeah, shove in Younger Man's testicles on yourself

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:16.200
 when you will become his Younger Self,

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.040
 is what they thought.

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:18.640
 And then in Chicago, there was a famous doctor,

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:22.440
 Dr. Lespinass, and he did, I think,

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.880
 one of the first successful testicle transplant ops

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:29.400
 in 1911, and this was actually for a man

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.160
 who'd lost both his testicles,

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.320
 weirdly, in two separate incidents.

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:34.280
 - Stop.

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:36.240
 Just don't go back to that place.

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:40.160
 - Just resign your job at the archery range.

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:42.800
 - So he's lost both--

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:43.720
 - Two separate incidents.

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:44.840
 - Yeah, one was an accident,

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:47.200
 and then one was a botch-turnier operation.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.040
 - Oh, that's terrible.

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:49.000
 - I know, it's very sad.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:49.840
 - That's a real bit, that's a real bit.

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:50.840
 - Sorry we made jokes about that.

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:52.240
 - But he had this surgery,

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:55.000
 and so this is where the origin of the testicle transplant,

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.880
 giving you this amazing virility he came from.

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:57.960
 He had this surgery, and he said,

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:00.400
 "After the surgery, he had a strong erection

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.480
 "accompanied by marked sexual desire, so intense,

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.160
 "he insisted on checking out of the hospital right away

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.000
 "so he could satisfy it."

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.040
 - Wow. - And so his doctor was like,

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:13.280
 "Wow, I found this amazing new thing for you guys."

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:15.400
 - And that was the guy in Chicago, right?

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.240
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:19.480
 - And these things were in Chicago as well, right?

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.800
 - Yeah, exactly. - These testicle thefts.

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:24.080
 And in the same year as these thefts happened,

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.720
 there was a very, very famous example

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:30.400
 of the richest man in Chicago who's called Harold McCormick,

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.840
 and he underwent some kind of surgery,

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.160
 and they never said what it was,

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.840
 but all the press was certain

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.160
 that he was getting bowls put into his bowls.

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.200
 Everyone was so sure he was gonna do it,

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.600
 and it was Lesbian Ass again who was doing it.

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.600
 And the thing was, he had just married this woman

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.840
 called Gana Valska, who was an opera singer

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.400
 who was much, much younger than him.

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:50.560
 She was very, very famous.

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:53.240
 Her first four husbands had been worth a total

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:55.760
 of $125 million.

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:56.800
 - First four?

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:57.920
 - Yeah, he was her fifth.

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.200
 - That's going it. - That's going some, right?

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:03.640
 But then he married her, and the idea was that he thought

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.080
 he'd never be able to keep up with her

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:07.560
 if he didn't have this operation.

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:08.800
 She was amazing, by the way.

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.600
 After she divorced McCormick,

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:12.520
 she married a guy called Harry Mathews

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:15.480
 who claimed to have created a death ray.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.720
 - Cool. - This is the most amazing

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.160
 woman I've never heard of.

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:22.120
 He was British, this guy, it was in 1924.

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:24.760
 He told everyone that he'd invented this death ray,

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.880
 and the government said, "Oh, can we have a look at it?"

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:29.520
 And he went, "Well, give me some money first."

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:30.760
 And they went, "Well, we're not gonna do that."

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.680
 He went, "All right, I'm going to France then."

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:34.480
 And he said he was gonna go away,

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:37.000
 and there was a law made to stop him

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.200
 from going and selling his death ray,

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.840
 which obviously didn't exist to the French

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:43.120
 and to the other people. - That's so funny.

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:44.360
 - Wow. - Yeah.

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:45.520
 - So what was her type?

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:47.440
 It's hard, like, just weirdos?

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.840
 - Very, very rich men to start off with.

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:53.880
 Then men with testicles put into their testicles.

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:56.120
 Then death ray guys, and then she ended up

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:58.040
 with a yoga teacher.

00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:00.040
 - The obvious end point.

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:01.800
 - Anna, I don't think the 1911 guy

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.280
 was actually the very first,

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.960
 'cause I think there was a previous doctor called

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.280
 Charles-Edward Brown-Sequod. - Yeah, he was in my band.

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:09.760
 - So in the 1880s, he was convinced

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.760
 that you could reverse your aging.

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:13.840
 He was a brilliant doctor, by the way.

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.080
 He genuinely was a great doctor.

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:16.360
 He worked on the spinal cord

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.600
 and revolutionized our understanding of it.

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:23.600
 But he also, okay, he started injecting himself

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.960
 not only with human seed,

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:28.840
 but he started with dog and guinea pig seed.

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:31.960
 - Mm, guinea pig seed. - Mixed up with blood

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:34.080
 just to really, you know, make it weirder.

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.600
 - And he claimed, he was in his early 70s at the time,

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.880
 and he said, "This has done me a power of good."

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:41.120
 - All I do all day is run around in a wheel.

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:42.880
 (laughing)

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.080
 - He claimed his eyes had improved.

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:46.320
 He could see better.

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.960
 He could run up and down stairs again,

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.240
 which he hadn't done for years.

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:52.640
 He claimed he could lift 15 pounds more than previously.

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:56.120
 And he claimed the average length of his jet of urine

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:58.800
 had increased by 25%.

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.800
 - Okay. - All thanks to guinea pig.

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.240
 - That's what you want. - You stood next to him

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.080
 and said, "Are you riding on it?

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:04.440
 "He's three feet behind you."

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:05.520
 (laughing)

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.080
 - And the operation go.

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:09.200
 - So you ride all punches through the wall.

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:11.960
 (laughing)

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.320
 - That's amazing. - And that set off,

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:14.560
 'cause I think we've mentioned him before,

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:17.280
 and guinea pig testicle transplants became a big thing.

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:21.080
 But that set off a big wave of kind of transplanting,

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:23.400
 other experiments with other animal testicle transplants.

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:26.120
 And so, there was a surgeon called Serge Voronoff,

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:27.680
 and his wife, Mrs. Voronoff,

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:30.680
 Dr. and Mrs. Voronoff, who became very famous

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:33.760
 for implanting monkey testicles into men.

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.440
 And what they would do is,

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.120
 they'd remove the monkey testicle,

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:38.680
 cut it into segments,

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:40.160
 and then they'd make an incision

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.960
 in the scrotum of the human,

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:46.040
 and then they would slot one of the segments into that.

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.360
 - Okay. - Like squeezing

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:49.600
 an extra slice into a cake sort of thing.

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.080
 - Or a chocolate orange kind of thing.

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:53.200
 - Oh, wow. - Yes, yeah, yeah.

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.480
 - And how many times would you,

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:57.440
 I just, I'm trying to picture a millionaire

00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:01.480
 walking around with 16 testicles worth of testicles in there,

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:04.360
 like, just adding to it, just really indulging.

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.800
 - It's a good job they don't do it anymore, isn't it?

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.440
 Can you imagine, like, I don't know,

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:11.080
 Mark Zuckerberg walking around with, like,

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:14.160
 200,000 testicles dragging behind them?

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.920
 - Well, the names we're mentioning

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:18.040
 are quite obscure names from history,

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:19.840
 but there is one name that sticks out

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:22.640
 who supposedly had monkey testicle injections

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.480
 into his own nut bag,

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:28.000
 and that is W.B. Yates, the poet.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.640
 - Oh. - Supposedly he had this done.

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:36.000
 And, yeah, I mean, and he was very sex-crazy

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.200
 into his later life.

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:40.120
 He supposedly was going to Harley Street in London,

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:41.640
 and he was having these things.

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:42.600
 It was all rumours.

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:44.680
 We weren't, I don't think it's been fully confirmed,

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:47.080
 but he had multiple affairs in the final,

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.520
 about twilight years of his life.

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:50.480
 - And he was a weirdo, yeah, essentially.

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:52.120
 He was into some freaky shit.

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:53.960
 So I believe it. - The occult and stuff, yeah.

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:55.760
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:58.360
 Apparently, if you have your,

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:01.120
 let's say a testicle falls out of you,

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:02.200
 you have-- - Let's just say.

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.360
 - Let's just say scenario,

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.240
 you're going home tonight here in Poole,

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:07.400
 and whoop, my testicle's fallen out.

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.840
 You have between four to six hours

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:11.840
 of getting it back inside. - That's ages.

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:13.240
 - You must have to keep it on ice

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:14.440
 in the meantime, I should think.

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:17.640
 - Yeah, exactly, so we did Richard Herring's podcast

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:21.600
 not too long ago, and Richard Herring, sadly, very,

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:24.280
 he's absolutely fine, but he had testicular cancer

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:25.760
 and he had a testicle removed.

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.480
 He asked us to find some facts about it,

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:28.760
 and one of the things that I found out

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:33.240
 was that a testicle transplant had happened

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:36.200
 in recent years between two identical twins,

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:40.720
 one of whom was born with the testicles, just two,

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:43.200
 but the other was missing them entirely,

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:45.840
 and they were able to transplant a testicle

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:48.400
 to the brother, and they were in their 30s,

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:51.560
 and it was a doctor called Dr. Dickon Coe,

00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:56.560
 and Dr. Dickon was able to successfully transplant it,

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:59.600
 and it was great because you were transplanting it

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:00.960
 basically to the same body.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.880
 - 'Cause it's genetically, we're identical twins.

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:06.200
 - Yeah, exactly, yeah, but four to six hours is roughly--

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:07.640
 - Do you mean four to six hours

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:09.600
 during which the testicle will still be viable?

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:11.040
 - Yes. - Okay, so when you said

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:13.040
 if your testicle falls out, you know,

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:15.440
 you do have to sort of sew up the wound and stuff,

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:16.880
 and you just mean the testicle,

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.200
 you'll still be able to reattach it,

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.920
 and it will still function. - Yes, and it will still function

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:22.680
 as a transplanted object of the body, yeah.

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:23.520
 - If it's happening now,

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.360
 you can stay 'til the end of the show,

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:26.760
 and you still have bags of time.

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:28.880
 - Yeah, I'll say bags.

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:32.560
 - We need to move on to our next fact.

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:37.000
 It is time for fact number three, and that is Anna.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.040
 - Yes, my fact this week is that until 2016,

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:45.040
 the Indian government earned $10 million a year

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:48.800
 from a single tiger, pretty impressive tiger.

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.040
 - How do you make so much money from a tiger?

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:52.760
 - It just worked really hard.

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:56.080
 No, this was a tiger called Machli, very famous tiger,

00:26:56.080 --> 00:27:00.240
 big celebrity in India, and Bengal Tigress, in fact,

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:05.240
 and she just became famous for being impressive

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.240
 and hardcore, lasting a long time.

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:10.120
 She did, she was constantly defeating the odds,

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:14.200
 so she would fight lots of much bigger male tigers

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.920
 for territory, she had one very famous altercation

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:20.280
 with a 14 foot crocodile that weighed twice as much of her,

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:23.000
 which, again, she had a real eye for PR

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.440
 because she always did this in front of tourists.

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:28.960
 So whenever a safari load of people came around,

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.360
 then suddenly she'd do something incredible,

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:33.000
 like kill a crocodile, which is a great pose,

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.280
 a very photogenic.

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:36.240
 And so, yeah, raked in money for the government,

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.280
 the state government.

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:38.720
 - For just people visiting to see her.

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:41.200
 - Exactly, yeah, estimated the number of people

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:43.480
 who just booked their holiday for her.

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.520
 - I read that she won a Lifetime Achievement Award

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:46.760
 for being a tiger.

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:48.520
 (laughing)

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:50.440
 - That's not that difficult, is it?

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:53.240
 Like, she is a tiger, so surely every tiger

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:54.840
 has a lifetime of being a tiger.

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.400
 - But I don't know, I don't think they do.

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:57.760
 - Who was the award from?

00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:00.040
 - Well, it wasn't BAFTA, I don't know exactly.

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:01.880
 Sorry, I didn't know who it was,

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:03.600
 it was Travel Operators for Tigers.

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:06.160
 - Oh, but yeah, you really won that one, don't you?

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.000
 - It's not the fucking Oscars.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:08.840
 - I know, but--

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:10.200
 - Probably the Oscars for tigers.

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.520
 - It may very well be-- - Exactly, yes.

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:14.280
 - It's very dangerous to have that award at the Oscars.

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:15.840
 That's a health and safety nightmare.

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:17.520
 Like, what dressing room do they use?

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:18.640
 It wouldn't work.

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.920
 - The carpet would be read by the end of the Oscars.

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:22.440
 - That's true.

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:24.000
 - But yeah, she was super cool,

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.360
 and she was so valuable to the government

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:28.120
 that in the end, her life was extended,

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:29.960
 so she died when she was 19,

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:32.080
 which was very old for a wild tiger.

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.880
 They'd usually die when they're 15.

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:36.320
 But one of the reasons that she died so old

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:39.440
 is because she lost a few of her teeth,

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:40.560
 she lost her canines,

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:41.840
 but actually she lost one eye,

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:43.800
 'cause she was always in these fights.

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:46.760
 And it was thought then that she was so valuable

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:48.600
 to the state, and people would be so devastated

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:49.920
 if she sort of starved to death,

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:51.080
 'cause she lost her teeth,

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:54.600
 that the state started leaving meat for her,

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:57.200
 a sort of tethered goat out in the wild,

00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:58.440
 so they didn't take her-- - And they were like alive,

00:28:58.440 --> 00:28:59.360
 weren't they, the goats?

00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:02.040
 - Yes, yeah, so they didn't take her into captivity.

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.440
 They just left her in the wild,

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:04.400
 but with a nice tethered goat.

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:05.800
 She must have thought that, I don't know,

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:08.000
 Christmas would come every single day.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.560
 - She must have thought that goats have got a bit stupid.

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:11.640
 - Yeah.

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:12.880
 - Was the money purely from people

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:15.360
 visiting the place that she resided,

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:18.000
 or was she, okay, so she wasn't doing like Pepsi ads,

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.240
 or like, she wasn't on T-shirts and merch?

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:22.400
 - No, she's very principled.

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:24.480
 She didn't believe in selling out and things like that.

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.080
 She just wanted to be herself.

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.840
 - I'm sure, definitely merch.

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:28.680
 There must have been merch.

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:30.000
 - Actually, there's just shed loads of merch, yeah.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.280
 Her images, she was on a stamp,

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:33.440
 which her painting is everywhere

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:35.720
 if you go to train stations in India.

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.200
 And this is up in Rajasthan in an actual park.

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:38.040
 - Oh, is she painted?

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:38.880
 Okay, yeah.

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:39.880
 - Yeah, it's impressive.

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:42.720
 It's mostly paw prints, but it's impressive nonetheless.

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.680
 - And she was the most photographed tiger

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:45.840
 in the world as well.

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:47.440
 - That's pretty amazing, isn't it?

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:49.440
 - Yeah, she had an amazing funeral

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:51.800
 because she was so kind of worshipped.

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:54.200
 So, in fact, all, I didn't realize this,

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:57.000
 all leopards and tigers are cremated in India

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.560
 when they die, or in international parks like this.

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:01.680
 And that is so that their skins can't be taken

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.680
 and sold on the black market,

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:06.400
 'cause obviously that encourages that.

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:08.040
 But, so she was cremated.

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:10.480
 But first, it's very cool, and there's a video of this.

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:12.560
 She was given a traditional Hindu funeral.

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:15.100
 So she was wrapped up in white linen,

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:18.120
 and you can just see her little head, quite big head,

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:18.960
 poking out above it,

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:21.240
 and then covered in lovely red flowers,

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:23.880
 and then carried on a kind of a funeral beer

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:27.760
 by lots of the park guards to this, to this pire.

00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:28.600
 - That's amazing, so cool.

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:30.000
 - Yeah, it's quite a beautiful ceremony.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:30.920
 - Yeah.

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:33.280
 Can I tell you, there's just a random tiger fact

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:35.360
 that I found quite cool.

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:40.280
 So, the MGM, the movies, right at the beginning,

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:44.120
 you've got the big lion that's through the thing, big roar.

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:47.760
 So, in the 80s, there was a sound designer

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:49.280
 called Mike Mangini,

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:54.000
 who was working on ambient sounds for the movie "Poltergeist."

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:54.840
 And while he was doing it,

00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:56.520
 he collected a lot of different sounds,

00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:58.200
 including tiger sounds.

00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.800
 And he sent that to the people at MGM saying,

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:02.080
 have a listen to these roars,

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:04.400
 'cause they're really quite more striking

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:07.200
 than you have for your current lion

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:09.160
 that is doing the MGM roar.

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:12.640
 So, when you hear that roar at the beginning of a movie,

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:14.240
 the lion is lip-syncing.

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:18.560
 It's a tiger's roar, it's not a lion's roar.

00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:21.520
 Lions apparently don't have quite that boomy,

00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:24.200
 amazing roar that a tiger has, so yeah.

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:25.040
 So, it's dope.

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:25.880
 - Interesting.

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:29.200
 Another Hollywood tiger would be Mike Tyson's tigers.

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:30.040
 - Oh yeah.

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:30.880
 - He used to have tigers.

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:32.840
 Is it in the hangover, he has some tigers,

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:35.360
 but that's actually in real life he used to have tigers.

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:36.640
 He doesn't have them anymore.

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:39.000
 Any ideas why he doesn't have them anymore?

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.840
 - Did they escape?

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:42.600
 - They did not escape, no.

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:44.040
 - Did he beat them up?

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:45.520
 - It's illegal to have tigers,

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:46.920
 and he shouldn't have put them in the movie

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.040
 'cause that told everyone he had them.

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:49.880
 - Sadly, quite legal to have tigers

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:50.880
 in some parts of America.

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:51.720
 - Oh, is it, okay.

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:53.760
 - And he didn't beat them up, Anna, no.

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:56.680
 It's because they smell so much and fart so much.

00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:57.520
 - Really?

00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:58.920
 - Apparently, he got married,

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:00.600
 and his wife didn't want them in the house

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:02.920
 because when they fart, they smell like hell.

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:05.000
 - Right, and now the tigers are gone.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.160
 She's like, "Why is that smell still here, Mike?

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:08.480
 "What?"

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:10.360
 - And there's tiger that we're talking about

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:12.600
 at the start, muchly, right?

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:15.040
 So she was blind in one eye,

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:19.560
 and I thought I'd look at kind of tiger opticians,

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:21.240
 and I found one.

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:24.080
 There is a person who is a tiger optician,

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:27.040
 a veterinarian, really, Tammy Miller,

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:29.840
 and she says there is one big problem

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:33.080
 with doing optician stuff on big cats.

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:34.360
 Can you think of what that might be?

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:38.400
 - They're massive tigers, and they'll eat your face.

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:40.920
 - A bit of that, but there's something else.

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:45.360
 - Ooh, they can't administer medicine to themselves.

00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:46.680
 - They can't put contact lenses in.

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.040
 You scratch your eyes.

00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:49.680
 - These are all great answers.

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:51.520
 According to her, the big problem

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:55.320
 is that they really hold a grudge, and so...

00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:57.080
 - How are we gonna work that out?

00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:58.360
 - Oh, wow.

00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:00.480
 - How did you not get that out of that, come on?

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:05.160
 And the thing was, is basically when you do the work on them,

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:07.000
 it's obviously not very pleasant for them,

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.960
 but then later on you need to go and do a bit more work on them,

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.080
 and they are not happy.

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:14.080
 They remember what you did, and they will not let you near them.

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:14.920
 But what I thought is,

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:17.040
 do you know that there's a kid's story

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:19.880
 about the lion who gets a thorn in the paw,

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:21.360
 and then you help them,

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:23.920
 and then they're always your friend forever?

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:24.760
 Not realistic.

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:26.200
 - No, okay.

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:27.720
 - Yeah, why aren't they grateful?

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:29.160
 - They can see again.

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:31.040
 - I thought you meant, when you said,

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:32.480
 and then the next time you see them,

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:34.520
 I thought you meant the grudge extended to them,

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:36.440
 sort of like sitting in cafes with coats

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:38.240
 on trying to get back at you,

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:40.960
 like they're tracking you down, but no, it's...

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:42.640
 - No, it's just the next time they see you.

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:45.360
 And this was, it was a time when they did some work

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:49.120
 on a big cat called Indira,

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:52.920
 and that basically they anesthetized them and did this work.

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:55.000
 But when you anesthetize one of these cats,

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.200
 then you obviously have to do quite a lot of work on them

00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:58.040
 at the same time.

00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:59.960
 You might as well, 'cause it's quite dangerous

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:01.320
 to anesthetize these animals,

00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:03.520
 so you might as well do as much as possible.

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:05.160
 I just say that because I really liked it

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:09.440
 because they did an MRI, an ultrasound, and a cat scan.

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:10.280
 - Nice.

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:11.800
 (laughing)

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:14.040
 - Listen, we need to move on to our final fact.

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:16.200
 It is time for our final fact of the show,

00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:17.720
 and that is my fact.

00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:22.040
 My fact this week is that St. Michael's Church in Bournemouth

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:26.000
 has been renamed St. Mike's to make it seem

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.160
 younger and cooler.

00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:29.240
 (laughing)

00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:31.760
 So this is a genuine thing.

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:34.880
 We're playing live in pool tonight.

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:36.640
 Bournemouth is just down the road,

00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:40.080
 and it's a 148 year old church.

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:44.400
 The Reverend Sarah Yetman believes that by changing the name,

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:48.400
 it's gonna be, you know, a nice hipper place to have

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:51.760
 groovy kids come in, listen to their record players.

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:52.600
 - Is it working?

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:54.680
 Do we think, I mean, Mike isn't that cool a name anyway.

00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:57.920
 I mean, apologies to any mikes in the audience.

00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:00.960
 It doesn't feel like it's one of the top 10 names these days.

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:03.840
 - No, I mean, but I guess it is just shorter than Michael.

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:05.760
 It's not like, you know, St. Dave's.

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:08.920
 I think it's a bit hard to just change saints all together.

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:11.360
 I wonder if this is gonna stick,

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:13.320
 'cause there has been backlash with people saying,

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:15.840
 come on, we can't start, you know,

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:17.440
 St. David's can't be St. Dave's.

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:20.800
 We can't suddenly just change the names of saints

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:21.640
 of our churches.

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:22.480
 - Where does it end?

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:23.320
 - It's a slippery slope.

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:26.960
 You'll have St. Twat's wagon that people go to worship in.

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:28.120
 - It's a Twat's wagon.

00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:31.080
 - Oh God, it's, where does it end?

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.000
 - He's in the Apocrypha.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.400
 He's not one of the main 12, but he is there, yeah.

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:38.040
 St. Jude, I guess for St. Judas,

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.480
 probably actually there isn't a St. Judas there.

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:41.320
 - There isn't a Judas there, isn't it?

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:42.160
 - There were two Judases, weren't there?

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:43.000
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:43.840
 - Great.

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:44.680
 - Like when you do get St. Jude's?

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:48.720
 - Yeah, but not St. Twat's, I think we could all agree.

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:49.720
 - Yeah.

00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:51.840
 - I don't mind it changing its name, I have to say.

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:53.160
 It's had a refurbishment.

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:56.640
 They've opened up a coffee bar as part of that

00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:59.000
 to offer a school drop off and so, you know,

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000
 get the kids in and so on.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.960
 I don't know, it's funny though.

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:03.800
 It is, yeah.

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:04.640
 - Yeah, it's really cool.

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:06.640
 I think it's great when churches do this.

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:08.920
 And there's a big push, although there always has been

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:11.760
 from the church to try and rejuvenate itself.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:13.280
 And I think there was a building,

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:16.080
 a church building review group in 2016,

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:17.760
 which is looking at all these big stone,

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:19.120
 like beautiful edifices we have,

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:22.200
 which are empty just all the time these days.

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:24.880
 And it was looking at how to repurpose them.

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:25.920
 And so now you get cool stuff,

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:29.240
 like St. Paul's Church in Bristol is now a circus school.

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:30.400
 And if you look at pictures of it,

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:33.560
 it's got like trapeze-wise and high-wise hung from the ceiling

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:35.200
 and people swinging all around it.

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:36.040
 - Wow.

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:36.880
 - It's great.

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:39.320
 There's about a dozen churches that are chomping sites.

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:40.160
 - Whating?

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:41.000
 - Chomping.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:41.840
 - Church camping.

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:43.160
 - Oh my God.

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:44.400
 - I've camped in a church.

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.240
 - Have you?

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:46.080
 - Yeah.

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:46.920
 - How come?

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:47.760
 - Yeah, a church hall.

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:48.600
 - Really?

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:50.920
 - For a fortnight when I was 17.

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:52.440
 - Two weeks in a church?

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:53.280
 - Yeah.

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.760
 - Your parents really didn't get along with you today.

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.360
 (laughing)

00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:58.760
 - What, for any reason or?

00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:01.400
 - It was for, we were doing some sort of volunteering thing

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:03.440
 and you had to go and live in the church

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:06.080
 and then take out the kids of the parish during the week.

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:08.720
 - I did once sleep in a church in Northumberland.

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:09.560
 I must say, yeah.

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:12.080
 I was, we'd gone, we went on a walk

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:13.120
 'cause I went to a Catholic school.

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:16.040
 We went on a walk and then we went to this little village

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:18.240
 in Northumberland and we decided to play football

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:22.120
 against these kids and they were so much rougher than us.

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:24.600
 And basically it turned into a massive fight

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:28.080
 and when I say fight, it was them trying to beat us up

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:29.960
 and we legged it into the local church.

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:31.480
 It went, sanctuary, sanctuary.

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:33.640
 (laughing)

00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:36.680
 - Did they tell you to piss off and fight the kids?

00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:38.120
 - We stayed in there overnight.

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:38.960
 - Oh, that's nice.

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:39.800
 - Oh my God.

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:40.760
 - That's cool.

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:43.760
 Anyone else slept in a church or no?

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:45.440
 - No, not slept in a church.

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:47.960
 - I probably nodded off in a few church services.

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:48.800
 - Yeah.

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:50.120
 - That counts.

00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:52.200
 - Have you heard of Stony Fort Community Church

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:53.160
 in South Carolina?

00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:54.220
 - I don't believe so.

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:56.120
 - It would be staggering if you had.

00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:57.720
 These, I love these guys so much.

00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:58.880
 They have also changed their name.

00:37:58.880 --> 00:37:59.840
 They're a church.

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:04.840
 And until 2020, they were called Outbreak Church

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:06.920
 and then they found themselves think,

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:08.040
 and it was set up in 2013.

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:10.240
 The vicar called Scott Carroll

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:11.760
 articulated his mission as follows.

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:13.440
 He said, "I want to be around people

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:15.440
 "who are so infected with Jesus

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:19.020
 "that every time they turn around, they sneeze Jesus."

00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:20.360
 And sneezes.

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:21.200
 - Yes.

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:22.240
 - Sneezes Christ.

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:25.720
 Every time they talked about the church,

00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:29.920
 they talked about contagion and infection and epidemic,

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:32.480
 they made bracelets and shirts with the phrase,

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:33.960
 "Are you contagious?"

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.120
 And people would read them and say,

00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:36.040
 "Contagious with what?"

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.480
 And they'd say, "Jesus."

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:41.200
 And he says, "This was really fun

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:44.800
 "until for some reason, early 2020, stop being funny."

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:47.800
 (audience laughing)

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:51.600
 - I was having a look at the Reverend Richard Coles'

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:53.280
 autobiography, a biography.

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:56.000
 And he was saying, it was just a throwaway line

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.000
 that I then looked into.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.640
 He was saying that a lot of vicar's have funny names

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:04.080
 and he was saying he knew someone who insisted on everyone,

00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:07.160
 even bishops, calling them the Reverend Gazz.

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:08.000
 And so then I thought,

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.280
 "I wonder what funny names there have been

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.800
 "in the church over the years?"

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:14.040
 There's this blog, the blog of St. Chrysostom's Church

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:17.120
 in Manchester, and it's really good.

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:18.520
 Do you know when people put proper effort

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:20.440
 into quite an obscure thing?

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:22.680
 And there's a piece on funny names of church leaders

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:25.600
 throughout history, and there are some such good ones.

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:29.160
 So I like this anecdote, which is Henry Joy Fiennes-Clinton,

00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:31.640
 who was a rector in the early 20th century,

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:33.200
 who went to see the Bishop of London

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:35.520
 and the bishop said, "Take a chair, Clinton,"

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:38.560
 to which he replied, "It's Fiennes-Clinton."

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:41.360
 And the bishop said, "In that case, take two."

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:44.560
 And so it's just, I think, a little funny from a bishop.

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:45.560
 (laughing)

00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:48.880
 - Come on, it's over! - It's Bishop Humor.

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:50.120
 It's Bishop Humor, yeah.

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:51.720
 - Okay, we won't get him on the podcast.

00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:54.360
 It's just, this is his audition tape, and I thought...

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:55.880
 - Oh, no, come on, give us more zingers.

00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:57.920
 - Right, wow. (laughing)

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:00.560
 - Okay, okay, what about this?

00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:04.640
 The very Reverend Gonville-Obey French Baytag,

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:08.800
 but French is spelled with a small F and two of them.

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:09.640
 (laughing)

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:10.480
 - What's going on?

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:12.400
 - Is that important for the anecdote?

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:14.240
 - There's no anecdote. - That's it, that's it.

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:16.360
 - That's it? - That's just the thing.

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:19.080
 - It's just the word French spelled slightly differently.

00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:20.720
 No, Anna, we want you to tell us

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:22.320
 every single one you've found.

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:23.360
 (laughing)

00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:25.520
 - This is literally all I've got now.

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:28.520
 This is not very amusing names.

00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:31.920
 Okay, Father John, Brabazan, Brabazan, Loutha?

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:32.760
 Come on!

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:33.840
 - It's two Brabazans.

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:35.480
 - Brabazan, Brabazan?

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:38.720
 - Oh my God, I'm just picturing Jimmy Carr

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:40.960
 at the Hammersmith Apollo.

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:43.000
 Your next act is a fucking killer act.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.520
 She's got some amazing anecdotes.

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:46.160
 Anna Tashinsky, everybody.

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:47.480
 (laughing)

00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:50.040
 (humming)

00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:50.880
 - Woo!

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:52.360
 We've got Father Page Turner.

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:54.040
 We've got Father Pickles.

00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:57.040
 - Page Turner, open with Page Turner.

00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:58.160
 (laughing)

00:40:58.160 --> 00:40:59.000
 That's great.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.080
 Father Pickles is funny as well.

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:01.080
 - I'll reorder the set.

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:03.880
 Father Careful, Father Christmas.

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:05.560
 - Okay! - Let's go.

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:07.320
 - So that's the one I should stick with,

00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:08.160
 Father Christmas.

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:11.320
 - I don't think stick with any of it, but, you know,

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:13.760
 have you guys heard of St. Andrew Undershaft?

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:15.880
 (laughing)

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:18.960
 - I can't believe, you just said a name way funnier

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:20.520
 than Anna's 20 days.

00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:21.680
 (laughing)

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:23.720
 - Upstage the full day of work.

00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:24.880
 - I'm so sorry.

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:26.200
 - I've been delving into church.

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:28.840
 - I'm so sorry, this is right under your nose

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:30.280
 the whole time.

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:32.680
 St. Andrew Undershaft is a church in London,

00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:34.720
 and it was literally under a massive shaft.

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:36.920
 That's the reason it was named like that.

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:39.760
 - It was a massive maypole, a huge maypole.

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:42.320
 I was, this is the 16th century, gigantic maypole.

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:44.280
 Can't stress how big this maypole was.

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:47.720
 And it was there every year around May Day

00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:52.600
 until an event in 1517 called the Evil May Day Riots.

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:53.440
 - Ooh.

00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:54.600
 - Which I had never heard of before.

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:56.360
 And they were these huge riots.

00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:58.120
 They were huge anti-foreigner riots,

00:41:58.120 --> 00:41:59.560
 so they weren't very funny.

00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:02.080
 But the may, so the maypole was--

00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:02.920
 - I'll put them in my set.

00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:04.000
 (laughing)

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.920
 - The maypole was toppled.

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:07.360
 The maypole had to fall.

00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:09.440
 And it was then preserved in a house

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:11.200
 on nearby Shaft Alley.

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:15.880
 But the maypole itself was then destroyed in 1549

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:17.280
 as a pagan idol.

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:18.280
 So, yeah.

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:20.400
 But the church St. Andrew Undershaft,

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:22.360
 500 years later nearly, still has its name.

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:24.280
 - Yeah, cool. - Nice.

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:26.800
 - I'm so sorry that I need to do this,

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:28.760
 but it's bugging me.

00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:31.080
 So why was the double F thing funny?

00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:33.520
 (laughing)

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:35.800
 - Tell us the name again, Anna.

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:36.640
 - Right.

00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:41.640
 The very reverend Gonville-Obey French Baytag,

00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:45.360
 but French is spelled with a small F.

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:46.200
 - Yeah.

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:47.320
 - And two of them.

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:48.360
 (laughing)

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:50.800
 - I'm now finding it funny.

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:53.040
 I think I've gone through the unfunniness.

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:53.880
 (laughing)

00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:55.000
 I'm finding it funny again.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.360
 - I find it so funny that there's two Fs in the word funny.

00:42:58.360 --> 00:42:59.200
 (laughing)

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:00.840
 And they're both lowercase.

00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:02.840
 (laughing)

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:05.480
 - I got told the thing by a very good friend of ours,

00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:08.120
 Jason Haisley, who is a friend of the podcast.

00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:09.480
 He's been on it a couple of times.

00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:13.400
 And we mentioned a fact quite a long time ago,

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:15.640
 which is, and it was about 50-odd episodes ago,

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:18.280
 which is that flying saucer suites

00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:21.000
 are made by this Belgium company, Belgica.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.060
 And they are the same people

00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:24.800
 who make the communion wafers.

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:26.920
 And when Christianity was declining a bit,

00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:28.880
 it meant that they had a lot of spare wafers.

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:30.640
 And so it's the flying saucers

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:32.800
 that are made out of Jesus,

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:34.680
 of Jesus's body is the flying.

00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:37.880
 - Oh, Christianity, I thought you said Christianity.

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:39.440
 I thought you were trying for another funny name.

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:40.400
 (laughing)

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:43.720
 - Anna, please, no, please not Reverend Christianity.

00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:46.200
 (laughing)

00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:48.160
 Too boring.

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:51.200
 - If it was Christianity, that would be pretty good.

00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:53.960
 (laughing)

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:55.320
 - I just misheard again.

00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:56.340
 I thought, I don't want to raise it

00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:58.340
 because he's a really famous guy.

00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:00.520
 And I know no one else has heard of it.

00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:02.440
 Sorry, Christianity was declining.

00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:03.880
 - Yeah, so flying saucer suites

00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:06.440
 are basically communion wafers, that's the thing.

00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:09.200
 So Jason was listening to our podcast,

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:10.800
 absolutely blown away by it.

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:13.440
 And he messaged his friend who was a vicar

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:14.440
 and he told her this story

00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:16.280
 and he said it blew her mind as well.

00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:19.280
 And then he said, she went, oh my God, hang on.

00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:21.600
 She said that when she was in training as a vicar

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:25.320
 because communion wafers, or hosts as they're properly known,

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:27.480
 are the literal body of Christ,

00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:30.000
 trainees don't use genuine communion wafers,

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.960
 they use flying saucers.

00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:36.080
 And so by accident, they're accidentally using this.

00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:37.560
 And I know James, I think you said

00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:38.840
 that this doesn't feel right.

00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:41.160
 So I think it's like particular to her story.

00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:43.640
 - Yeah, I mean, well, like we always do

00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:45.080
 when people send us stuff like this,

00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:47.040
 we go into a massive amount of detail

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:49.000
 and I emailed all the reverends and vickers

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.560
 and priests that I knew.

00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:53.600
 And they reckon that until transubstantiation for them,

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:55.680
 it isn't the body of Christ, so they wouldn't do that.

00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:57.040
 But that's not to say this person didn't.

00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:58.840
 - Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:00.200
 Can you do it, 'cause they're flying saucers,

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:01.560
 can you do it from a distance?

00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:03.240
 (laughing)

00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:04.680
 - 'Cause I think I would start going to church

00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:06.760
 if someone threw a flying saucer into my mouth.

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:07.600
 - That's true.

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:09.120
 - And then you'd just be jumping up like a dog

00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:09.960
 to try and catch it.

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:10.800
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:11.640
 - That'd be cool.

00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:13.520
 - If you did it like how they do in the bouquet at a wedding,

00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:15.160
 who's gonna get body of Christ this week?

00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:17.160
 (laughing)

00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:18.320
 Who's going to heaven?

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:19.280
 - It's one of you.

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:21.720
 (laughing)

00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:23.360
 We're gonna have to wrap up in a sec, guys.

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:25.640
 - Oh, is there no time for us and more names?

00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:27.160
 - Oh, okay, I'm so glad you've asked.

00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:28.560
 Ryan McGvicker?

00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:30.520
 - I can't believe you've got more.

00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:31.360
 (laughing)

00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:33.440
 - Ryan McGvicker is great.

00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:34.280
 (laughing)

00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:35.120
 - Yeah, that is good.

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:38.360
 - My god, are you pissing around with the French guy?

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:41.000
 When you had Ryan McGvicker tucked all the way up your sleeve?

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.000
 - I still think F-F-F-F-F-F-F-French is the best.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.120
 - Maybe, maybe.

00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:48.160
 - Can I just, on churches reinventing themselves,

00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:50.680
 there is a church that's shaped like a high-heeled shoe

00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:53.400
 in Taiwan, which has the Guinness record

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:55.880
 for the largest high-heeled shoe shape structure.

00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:57.640
 And it was built in 2016.

00:45:57.640 --> 00:45:59.360
 It's actually a wedding venue,

00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:00.960
 so it's not ordained by God.

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:02.680
 It's like a wedding church.

00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:04.640
 But it was built to attract women.

00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:07.480
 And the Taiwanese government said

00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:10.600
 there will be a hundred female-oriented features inside,

00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:14.200
 like maple leaves, chairs for lovers,

00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:16.240
 with biscuits and cakes.

00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:17.080
 - Women.

00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:19.000
 (laughing)

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.520
 - That's, and it's so weird.

00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:23.040
 It's inspired by the story of a girl in the 1960s

00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:24.640
 who got Blackfoot disease,

00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:26.480
 had both of her legs amputated,

00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:28.480
 and her groom canceled her wedding.

00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:30.680
 So it's in honor of her, which I actually think

00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:31.520
 is quite offensive.

00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:33.040
 - They made the church shape like a shoe.

00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:33.880
 - Yes.

00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:35.520
 (laughing)

00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:36.840
 - Not sure that's okay.

00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:39.400
 Wow, those female things.

00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:42.120
 I didn't know that women like maple leaves so much.

00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:42.960
 - Oh my God, it's what we talk about.

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:43.800
 - It's great.

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:45.200
 Actually, every time I get home from a tour gig,

00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:48.280
 the house is full of maple leaves and it's a nightmare.

00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:50.160
 - Well, you mean the ice hockey team.

00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:51.520
 (laughing)

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:53.000
 - Oh yeah.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.840
 - Well, they do your house when you've been away on tar.

00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:55.680
 - I don't know.

00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:58.160
 I'm gonna ask some questions when I get back this time.

00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:00.640
 - In 2019, have you guys heard of the company

00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:02.640
 called the Christian Book Depository?

00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:03.800
 - No.

00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:04.760
 - Yes, I think so.

00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:07.080
 - Yeah, so the Christian Book Depository,

00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:08.520
 they complained in 2019

00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:11.040
 'cause they kept getting phone calls like this.

00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:12.200
 A person would call up and say,

00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:14.000
 "Hey, I'm looking for my order."

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.280
 And they're like, "What did you order?"

00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:18.000
 He says, "I ordered gummies."

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.600
 And they went, "Ah, right, you're not in the right place."

00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:24.200
 And it turns out that their website, cbd.com,

00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:26.120
 who is attracting the wrong kind of people.

00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:29.120
 (laughing)

00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:32.200
 So they've changed their name to Christian Book.

00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:33.040
 - That's great.

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:34.920
 - Christian Book, that'll be a great name for a vicar.

00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:37.560
 (laughing)

00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:39.000
 - Look, we need to wrap up, guys.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.520
 Okay, that is it.

00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:41.880
 That is all of our facts.

00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:43.520
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:45.520
 If you would like to get in contact with any of us

00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:46.680

 - You can email our podcast at qi.com.

00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:00.760
 - And if you're a vicar with a funny name, please.

00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:01.600
 - Yes.

00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:02.440
 - Right in.

00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:03.600
 - Get in, yes.

00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:05.600
 Yep, or you can go to our website,

 knowssuchthingasafish.com.

00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:09.040
 That's fish with one F.

00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:11.280
 (laughing)

00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:14.440
 (audience applauding)

00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:18.400
 - And we thank you so much, Paul.

00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:20.080
 We've had so much fun here tonight.

00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:22.280
 And everyone listening at home will be back again next week

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:26.080
 in another episode, we'll see you then, goodbye!

00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:29.240
 (audience applauding)

00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:31.820
 (upbeat music)

00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:35.580
 (audience cheering)

00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:38.920
 (upbeat music)

00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:41.500
 (upbeat music)
