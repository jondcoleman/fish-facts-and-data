00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:17,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:17,00:00:20,"of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week"
00:00:20,00:00:23,coming to you live from Paul.
00:00:23,00:00:26,(audience cheering)
00:00:27,00:00:31,(audience cheering)
00:00:31,00:00:33,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here"
00:00:33,00:00:35,"with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:35,00:00:37,"and James Harkin, and once again,"
00:00:37,00:00:39,we have gathered round the microphones
00:00:39,00:00:43,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:00:43,00:00:46,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:46,00:00:49,"Starting with fact number one, and that is James."
00:00:49,00:00:52,- My fact this week is that tardy grades
00:00:52,00:00:55,"can survive being shot out of a gun,"
00:00:55,00:00:57,but they're a bit groggy afterwards.
00:00:57,00:01:00,- Tardy grades.
00:01:00,00:01:02,"- Tardy grades, yes."
00:01:02,00:01:04,"Tiny little things, not quite microscopic,"
00:01:04,00:01:07,"you can see them if you look really, really carefully,"
00:01:07,00:01:09,"but very, very small little things."
00:01:09,00:01:11,"Living in all over the world,"
00:01:11,00:01:13,"probably some in your garden,"
00:01:13,00:01:14,"probably some on this stage, no, they're not on this stage."
00:01:14,00:01:16,They live in like moss and in bits of grass
00:01:16,00:01:18,and stuff like that.
00:01:18,00:01:21,"They're really, really strong, powerful things."
00:01:21,00:01:22,You can't kill them.
00:01:22,00:01:24,Virtually nothing will kill them.
00:01:24,00:01:26,"- They're not powerful, like they can't put a lorry."
00:01:26,00:01:27,They're not going to be able to give you a piggyback.
00:01:27,00:01:29,"- If you go enough of them, I reckon, what do you reckon?"
00:01:29,00:01:32,"- I think it's enough of anything, you can put a lorry."
00:01:32,00:01:33,"- We don't need them to put a lorry,"
00:01:33,00:01:34,we just need them to drive a lorry.
00:01:34,00:01:37,(laughing)
00:01:37,00:01:39,"- Apparently scientists, I read,"
00:01:39,00:01:43,can't work out a scenario in which they would go extinct
00:01:43,00:01:46,"prior to the actual explosion of the sun, basically."
00:01:46,00:01:47,Like the end--
00:01:47,00:01:49,- Well the explosion of the sun might not kill them either.
00:01:49,00:01:50,- What?
00:01:50,00:01:52,"- So basically they can survive in space,"
00:01:52,00:01:54,"they can survive really, really hot temperatures,"
00:01:54,00:01:56,"really, really cold temperatures,"
00:01:56,00:01:58,they can survive loads of radiation.
00:01:58,00:01:58,"If they get in trouble,"
00:01:58,00:02:00,they just kind of shut their bodies down
00:02:00,00:02:02,and then kind of get rid of all the water
00:02:02,00:02:03,and you put a bit of water back on them
00:02:03,00:02:05,and they come back alive again.
00:02:05,00:02:08,And what has happened is some of these tardigrades
00:02:08,00:02:11,have been sent up into space onto the moon
00:02:11,00:02:13,and they've crashed into the moon.
00:02:13,00:02:16,And people are wondering maybe they're alive
00:02:16,00:02:18,and maybe they're actually living there on the moon.
00:02:18,00:02:19,"And so these people,"
00:02:19,00:02:22,this was a woman called Alejandra Tresbas
00:02:22,00:02:24,from Queen Mary University in London.
00:02:24,00:02:27,She did this experiment to see if they might still be alive.
00:02:27,00:02:29,"And so what she did is she put them in a gun,"
00:02:29,00:02:32,"shot them at a wall and saw how they were, basically."
00:02:32,00:02:33,- Wow.
00:02:33,00:02:36,- And they could survive impacts of up to a kilometer
00:02:36,00:02:38,"per second, that's 2,000 miles an hour,"
00:02:38,00:02:39,they could survive.
00:02:39,00:02:43,"And shot pressures of up to 1.14 gigapascals,"
00:02:43,00:02:45,"which I know out of context doesn't really mean anything,"
00:02:45,00:02:48,"but it's a lot, I promise you it's a lot."
00:02:48,00:02:49,"- So there's life in the universe now,"
00:02:49,00:02:51,"outside of Earth, in theory."
00:02:51,00:02:52,"We haven't yet confirmed it, but we know."
00:02:52,00:02:53,- Awesome.
00:02:53,00:02:54,- If can I just check?
00:02:54,00:02:56,Can I just ask how the groggyness exhibited itself?
00:02:56,00:02:58,I think we need to address this.
00:02:58,00:02:58,"- Oh yeah, yeah."
00:02:58,00:02:59,"- Okay, yeah."
00:02:59,00:03:03,So tardigrades are the smallest animal that have legs.
00:03:03,00:03:05,They have these little legs that they crawl around with
00:03:05,00:03:08,and they kind of have like a very specific gait
00:03:08,00:03:10,"and as they go quicker, they change the gait."
00:03:10,00:03:13,"But these ones, they kind of sort of staggered around"
00:03:13,00:03:15,a little bit when they kind of pull them back.
00:03:15,00:03:16,"But the problem with what you were saying, Dan,"
00:03:16,00:03:20,is the shot pressure that they've worked out
00:03:20,00:03:21,that there would have been on the moon
00:03:21,00:03:24,would have been greater than this 1.14 gigapascals.
00:03:24,00:03:25,So we think that the ones on the moon
00:03:25,00:03:27,probably are not alive.
00:03:27,00:03:29,"- Very disappointingly, yeah."
00:03:29,00:03:32,"So when scientists say we can't work out how to kill them,"
00:03:32,00:03:36,shoot them as the bullet of the gun.
00:03:36,00:03:37,"- We can work out how to,"
00:03:37,00:03:38,there are lots of ways you can kill them.
00:03:38,00:03:39,"- Yeah, you can just stamp on them."
00:03:39,00:03:40,- Can you?
00:03:40,00:03:42,"- Yeah, they're actually really easy to kill."
00:03:42,00:03:45,"Okay, I'm here to give you the disappointing truth"
00:03:45,00:03:47,about tardigrades because they've ruled the internet
00:03:47,00:03:48,is too long.
00:03:48,00:03:50,"A, there are plenty of ways to kill them."
00:03:50,00:03:54,"B, the whole, they can withstand massive temperatures."
00:03:54,00:03:55,They actually just did an experiment
00:03:55,00:03:58,where they realized they can't withstand temperatures
00:03:58,00:03:59,for very long at all.
00:03:59,00:04:01,And scientists now reckon that climate change
00:04:01,00:04:02,is gonna kill them before it kills us.
00:04:02,00:04:03,- No.
00:04:03,00:04:07,"- So the thing is, they can survive being boiled,"
00:04:07,00:04:09,but only if it happens quite quickly.
00:04:09,00:04:12,"And then they get back to a nice, normal temperature again."
00:04:12,00:04:14,But they didn't experiment recently where--
00:04:14,00:04:16,- It feels harsh that you're criticizing them
00:04:16,00:04:19,for not being able to withstand indefinite boiling.
00:04:19,00:04:21,I think it's impressive.
00:04:21,00:04:23,If I boiled an egg and then a few minutes later
00:04:23,00:04:24,it came out of the pan
00:04:24,00:04:26,"and it was still in its egg, raw egg state,"
00:04:26,00:04:26,I'd be impressed.
00:04:26,00:04:28,- I turned it to a chicken.
00:04:28,00:04:29,- Exactly.
00:04:29,00:04:30,- I'm not demanding indefinite.
00:04:30,00:04:33,I just think a couple of hours would be good.
00:04:33,00:04:35,"And they can't even survive, for instance,"
00:04:35,00:04:39,"like above 37 degrees for 24 hours,"
00:04:39,00:04:40,"half of tardigrades die,"
00:04:40,00:04:42,straight like within that amount of time.
00:04:42,00:04:45,"So, you know, any longer than that and then they all die."
00:04:45,00:04:47,"If you put them at 63 degrees,"
00:04:47,00:04:49,half of them are gone within like much shorter than that.
00:04:49,00:04:51,"And I think if you're in the 80s,"
00:04:51,00:04:52,then they don't last an hour.
00:04:52,00:04:53,- Yeah.
00:04:53,00:04:54,"Oh, I see, sorry."
00:04:54,00:04:56,"- Not the 1980s. - The 1980s, yeah."
00:04:56,00:04:57,- Amazing they made it through that decade.
00:04:57,00:04:59,It was a horrible decade for them.
00:04:59,00:05:00,"- Oh, the music."
00:05:00,00:05:02,- They are crushed by a Rubik's cube.
00:05:02,00:05:05,I don't think they are shit.
00:05:05,00:05:06,- What?
00:05:06,00:05:07,"- Well, I'm gonna stand up for tardigrades."
00:05:07,00:05:09,"- They do this thing, tardigrades do this thing."
00:05:09,00:05:12,It's seeding the world on its own.
00:05:12,00:05:14,So it can get picked up by the wind.
00:05:14,00:05:17,"It can get carried in the wind, land wherever,"
00:05:17,00:05:19,"and then wherever it lands,"
00:05:19,00:05:20,it can just reproduce asexually.
00:05:20,00:05:21,It doesn't need a partner.
00:05:21,00:05:24,"You could send it to the moon, just one,"
00:05:24,00:05:26,"and it'll be like, that's cool, I'll set up a colony."
00:05:26,00:05:29,Like it's a phenomenal little creature.
00:05:29,00:05:30,"- And the confusing thing about that,"
00:05:30,00:05:32,'cause there are obviously lots of organisms
00:05:32,00:05:33,"that can reproduce asexually,"
00:05:33,00:05:35,but it's quite confusing that they've managed
00:05:35,00:05:37,"to evolve successfully, right?"
00:05:37,00:05:38,"Because asexual reproduction,"
00:05:38,00:05:40,it's supposed to be a bit of a disadvantage
00:05:40,00:05:41,'cause you're only getting your own genes
00:05:41,00:05:42,over and over again.
00:05:42,00:05:43,You can't improve.
00:05:43,00:05:45,- And so how have they managed to do this?
00:05:45,00:05:47,- They have sex too.
00:05:47,00:05:50,They do also have sex under normal circumstances
00:05:50,00:05:52,if they can find another of the opposite sex.
00:05:52,00:05:55,And it's a very romantic process actually.
00:05:55,00:05:58,Tardigrade mating is very fascinating.
00:05:58,00:06:00,So here we go.
00:06:00,00:06:01,Step one.
00:06:01,00:06:06,- You've already killed any set of robots.
00:06:06,00:06:09,- Why don't you do it in like a Craig David style?
00:06:09,00:06:11,What would you do on a Monday?
00:06:11,00:06:14,"- On a Monday, the female would shed her outer skin"
00:06:14,00:06:16,and lay her eggs inside it.
00:06:16,00:06:17,- Keep talking to me.
00:06:17,00:06:18,Yes.
00:06:18,00:06:19,"- Okay, on a Tuesday?"
00:06:19,00:06:21,"- A Tuesday, the male would then arrive"
00:06:21,00:06:24,"and get into position and then fertilize the eggs,"
00:06:24,00:06:25,which are--
00:06:25,00:06:26,"- Wait, wait, wait."
00:06:26,00:06:29,That's making love on Thursday and Friday and Saturday.
00:06:29,00:06:31,"- Oh, Tuesday Wednesday is waiting."
00:06:31,00:06:34,"And then, when the male arrives,"
00:06:34,00:06:37,"so the male basically fertilizes the female's eggs,"
00:06:37,00:06:38,"which are outside her body,"
00:06:38,00:06:41,but they're still inside the shed exoskeleton
00:06:41,00:06:42,that she has cast off.
00:06:42,00:06:44,- But the thing about what she does with the skeleton
00:06:44,00:06:45,is she doesn't get out of it.
00:06:45,00:06:46,It's a bit like she takes--
00:06:46,00:06:47,"- No, she's still inside, she's--"
00:06:47,00:06:49,"- Yeah, so she sheds it,"
00:06:49,00:06:51,"but it's like taking your arms out of a coat,"
00:06:51,00:06:52,but keeping it around you.
00:06:52,00:06:54,- It's like a much more disgusting version of doing that.
00:06:54,00:06:55,- Yes.
00:06:55,00:06:56,"- Right, yeah."
00:06:56,00:06:58,And then the male has sex with the coat is what we say.
00:06:58,00:06:59,- Yes.
00:06:59,00:07:00,(laughing)
00:07:00,00:07:01,"- Yes, exactly."
00:07:01,00:07:02,- Wow.
00:07:02,00:07:05,- The male has sex in between the coat and you.
00:07:05,00:07:06,(laughing)
00:07:06,00:07:09,"- And then you just chill on Sunday, yeah."
00:07:09,00:07:09,(laughing)
00:07:09,00:07:13,"- The good thing is, they do it to the face,"
00:07:13,00:07:16,but it ends up around the back.
00:07:16,00:07:18,And this scientists don't understand
00:07:18,00:07:19,how this works yet.
00:07:19,00:07:19,- I don't understand what you're saying.
00:07:19,00:07:24,"- Right, so if you picture their sexual position,"
00:07:24,00:07:29,the male curls himself around the female's face.
00:07:29,00:07:33,"Okay, so his crotch is in her face."
00:07:33,00:07:35,Her face is buried in his crotch.
00:07:35,00:07:38,And then she does these weird sucking motions
00:07:38,00:07:40,"with her throat, which kind of stimulates."
00:07:40,00:07:41,- Oh my God.
00:07:41,00:07:43,"- This genuinely happens, and it is quite romantic."
00:07:43,00:07:45,"- Mr. David, I think we're gonna need to rewrite"
00:07:45,00:07:46,us some of these lyrics.
00:07:46,00:07:49,(laughing)
00:07:49,00:07:50,- She doesn't see sucking motions.
00:07:50,00:07:52,It's a full hour of foreplay.
00:07:52,00:07:53,- Wow.
00:07:53,00:07:54,- Kind of unbelievable for these tiny creatures.
00:07:54,00:07:57,And then he ejaculates multiple times.
00:07:57,00:07:58,"Impressive, guys, take note."
00:07:58,00:08:02,"But then he ejaculates under the skin,"
00:08:02,00:08:05,"but then her eggs come out the back, her cloaca."
00:08:05,00:08:06,So we don't really know how the sperm
00:08:06,00:08:09,is climbing all the way around to get to the eggs.
00:08:09,00:08:11,"- And what happens to the coats, though, I don't..."
00:08:11,00:08:12,- Yeah.
00:08:12,00:08:15,"- Oh, I think they grow up in the coat, don't they?"
00:08:15,00:08:17,"I think the eggs are fertilized,"
00:08:17,00:08:19,"but they stay inside the coat, and I think that's a..."
00:08:19,00:08:21,- I was thinking that poor dry cleaner
00:08:21,00:08:22,when you hand that in.
00:08:22,00:08:25,(laughing)
00:08:25,00:08:27,"- I agree, Dan, they're not shit."
00:08:27,00:08:28,They're not completely shit.
00:08:28,00:08:30,They're about one-third shit.
00:08:30,00:08:33,And that is because they can poo one-third
00:08:33,00:08:35,the size of their body in a single go.
00:08:35,00:08:37,"- Ah, like a sloth."
00:08:37,00:08:38,"Sloths do that, don't they?"
00:08:38,00:08:41,"- Sloths do that, do they, one-third."
00:08:41,00:08:43,"- I think that baby sloths, baby sloths can be here."
00:08:43,00:08:45,"- Well, it's the equivalent of me pooing out"
00:08:45,00:08:48,"a large pair of speakers, a 10-year-old child,"
00:08:48,00:08:50,or an adult Dalmatian.
00:08:50,00:08:52,(laughing)
00:08:52,00:08:54,- A 10-year-old child?
00:08:54,00:08:56,(laughing)
00:08:56,00:08:57,"- Is this a game of ""Would You Rather?"""
00:08:57,00:08:59,(laughing)
00:08:59,00:09:02,"- I'm not sure about this 101 Dalmatians remake, actually."
00:09:02,00:09:03,I think I'd rather...
00:09:03,00:09:05,"- Wow. - Wow, that's a lot of poo."
00:09:05,00:09:07,"- It's amazing, the video is good, isn't it?"
00:09:07,00:09:10,You should really watch the video of Tardigreads
00:09:10,00:09:12,"taking a poo, a Tardigread taking a poo,"
00:09:12,00:09:14,'cause you can feel it really trying to squeeze it out
00:09:14,00:09:15,and get away from it.
00:09:15,00:09:18,"And it's enormous, I think it looks much bigger"
00:09:18,00:09:19,than a third of its body.
00:09:19,00:09:21,"- There are two of them, it's by weight, it's a third."
00:09:21,00:09:23,There are two videos of them pooing.
00:09:23,00:09:25,"One of them, it's like really, really trying."
00:09:25,00:09:27,"The other one, it's finding it a lot easier,"
00:09:27,00:09:30,but the researcher who was doing that reckons it's
00:09:30,00:09:33,"because it was squashed between two pieces of glass,"
00:09:33,00:09:35,and maybe the squashing this helped it to send the poo out.
00:09:35,00:09:37,"- Oh my gosh, it's like a fetish video then"
00:09:37,00:09:38,that you guys watched.
00:09:38,00:09:40,(laughing)
00:09:40,00:09:41,- It's like when you massage your stomach a bit
00:09:41,00:09:43,to help out with conservation.
00:09:43,00:09:44,- Just like that.
00:09:44,00:09:45,- Exactly.
00:09:45,00:09:47,"- Just like that, the Tommy Cooper cat race."
00:09:47,00:09:49,(laughing)
00:09:49,00:09:51,Can we talk about them the way they suspend
00:09:51,00:09:52,and then reanimate?
00:09:52,00:09:53,"- Okay, sure. - 'Cause it is really,"
00:09:53,00:09:56,"really cool, so they, as James said,"
00:09:56,00:09:58,"if their environment dries out, so they live in moss,"
00:09:58,00:10:02,"they also get called moss piglets, which is adorable."
00:10:02,00:10:05,"And if their bit of moss dries out,"
00:10:05,00:10:07,"then they dry out with it, as it were,"
00:10:07,00:10:10,and they enter a thing called cryptobiosis.
00:10:10,00:10:12,"So they roll into a ball, they shrivel up,"
00:10:12,00:10:14,"they're normally 85% water,"
00:10:14,00:10:16,"that goes down to 3% water,"
00:10:16,00:10:18,so they're almost completely desiccated.
00:10:18,00:10:22,"But then, if you put water on them, whoop, back they come."
00:10:22,00:10:24,And scientists have been testing for decades
00:10:24,00:10:26,"how long they can go for, and the problem is,"
00:10:26,00:10:28,you need a tardigrade that was dried out
00:10:28,00:10:30,decades ago to experiment.
00:10:30,00:10:33,"- The latest experiment on this was in 1983,"
00:10:33,00:10:35,"a group of Japanese scientists in Antarctica,"
00:10:35,00:10:38,"they found and they froze a group of tardigrades,"
00:10:38,00:10:41,"and 31 years later, in 2014,"
00:10:41,00:10:43,"they popped some water on them, and they woke up."
00:10:43,00:10:45,"- Wow. - Took them about two weeks,"
00:10:45,00:10:46,but they were called SB1 and SB2
00:10:46,00:10:48,for Sleeping Beauty One and Sleeping Beauty Two.
00:10:48,00:10:50,- Aw. - That's nice.
00:10:50,00:10:51,"- And one of them, one of them,"
00:10:51,00:10:54,"they both came around, one egg they had frozen also,"
00:10:54,00:10:55,"hatched into a healthy tardigrade,"
00:10:55,00:10:58,which then laid its own eggs eight days later.
00:10:58,00:11:00,"It's incredible the way they come back, yeah."
00:11:00,00:11:02,- But did they have lots of very dated cultural references?
00:11:02,00:11:04,(laughing)
00:11:04,00:11:08,"- There was a story of one that was found in a museum,"
00:11:08,00:11:10,"wasn't there, that was 100 years old,"
00:11:10,00:11:12,"supposedly came back to life as well,"
00:11:12,00:11:14,"but that's not in a paper, that's kind of anecdotal."
00:11:14,00:11:16,"- It's a bit, yeah, it's an Italian scientist"
00:11:16,00:11:19,"who said it moved its leg, and it's kind of unclear"
00:11:19,00:11:21,"whether it moved its leg or whether he nudged it a bit,"
00:11:21,00:11:24,"and so I, oh, look, there it is, yeah, yeah."
00:11:24,00:11:25,But we're gonna have to move on to our next fact
00:11:25,00:11:26,"in a sec, guys."
00:11:26,00:11:30,"- Can I, just because I'm the anti-tardigrade on the panel,"
00:11:30,00:11:32,"I'd like to put forward my rival to tardigrades,"
00:11:32,00:11:35,"and that is the Deloitte rotifer,"
00:11:35,00:11:38,"and this is another tiny creature,"
00:11:38,00:11:39,"about the same size, maybe a tiny bit smaller,"
00:11:39,00:11:42,"you could maybe, it's just on the cusp of being seeable,"
00:11:42,00:11:44,"and they can do all the same stuff,"
00:11:44,00:11:46,"survive unbelievable extremes,"
00:11:46,00:11:49,"like massive amounts of radiation,"
00:11:49,00:11:52,"huge heat being in permafrost for ages,"
00:11:52,00:11:54,"much more radiation than tardigrades can survive,"
00:11:54,00:11:58,"by the way, and they were thought to be able"
00:11:58,00:12:02,"to last a decade frozen and completely dried out,"
00:12:02,00:12:04,"and then be able to reanimate themselves,"
00:12:04,00:12:06,and scientists just found some trapped
00:12:06,00:12:09,"in Siberian permafrost, and realized they have"
00:12:09,00:12:12,"to reassess that, and it's not a decade they can,"
00:12:12,00:12:13,"you know, stay frozen and then come back to life,"
00:12:13,00:12:15,"it's 24,000 years."
00:12:15,00:12:17,"- Oh, what?"
00:12:17,00:12:18,- No.
00:12:18,00:12:20,"- Pop some water on, sprung straight back into action."
00:12:20,00:12:22,"- Those are pretty dated references, aren't they?"
00:12:22,00:12:23,(all laughing)
00:12:23,00:12:25,"It's like, oh, what about those bully mothers today?"
00:12:25,00:12:27,"- Yeah, they sound shit."
00:12:27,00:12:28,- Wow.
00:12:28,00:12:29,- All right.
00:12:29,00:12:30,- Not nice is it?
00:12:30,00:12:31,- Not nice.
00:12:31,00:12:31,(all laughing)
00:12:31,00:12:32,- Yeah.
00:12:32,00:12:33,Thank you.
00:12:33,00:12:35,"- They also, they're called Deloids,"
00:12:35,00:12:37,"and they begin with, guys, what do they begin with?"
00:12:37,00:12:38,What letter?
00:12:38,00:12:39,- D.
00:12:39,00:12:40,"- A B, a silent B."
00:12:40,00:12:42,(all laughing)
00:12:42,00:12:43,- You're kidding.
00:12:43,00:12:44,- How brave is that?
00:12:44,00:12:47,"- Like, is it a leech is a Deloid, isn't it?"
00:12:47,00:12:48,- Is it?
00:12:48,00:12:49,- I think so.
00:12:49,00:12:50,- Interesting.
00:12:50,00:12:51,"- No one knows that, so that might be wrong."
00:12:51,00:12:52,- Yeah.
00:12:52,00:12:54,"Anyway, we need to move on to our second fact,"
00:12:54,00:12:57,"time for fact number two, and that is Andy."
00:12:57,00:12:59,"My fact is that, in the 1920s,"
00:12:59,00:13:02,Chicago was hit by a miniature crime wave
00:13:02,00:13:05,"of testicle theft, which was nicknamed,"
00:13:05,00:13:08,"which was nicknamed, ""Gland Larsony."""
00:13:08,00:13:10,(all laughing)
00:13:10,00:13:11,Really impressive.
00:13:11,00:13:15,- Do you think if you'd had your testicles removed
00:13:15,00:13:16,"and you read that newspaper article,"
00:13:16,00:13:18,"you'd be like, ah, good one."
00:13:18,00:13:19,(all laughing)
00:13:19,00:13:21,Do you think they're making light
00:13:21,00:13:24,of what is probably quite a horrific experience?
00:13:24,00:13:26,"- It sounds terrible, it sounds terrible,"
00:13:26,00:13:28,but it is presented as a kind of funny thing
00:13:28,00:13:30,"that happened once, and it has been a hundred years."
00:13:30,00:13:33,"So, let's get into it."
00:13:33,00:13:34,"Next year, it actually is the centenary,"
00:13:34,00:13:36,so I know a lot of people will probably
00:13:36,00:13:39,be wanting to market somehow.
00:13:39,00:13:41,"- I think it's gonna be a public holiday, isn't it?"
00:13:41,00:13:43,- I think I might have a big ball.
00:13:43,00:13:45,(all laughing)
00:13:45,00:13:47,"- Well, one person who didn't have a big ball, James,"
00:13:47,00:13:49,"once this crime wave happened to him,"
00:13:49,00:13:51,"the first victim in Chicago, who's an electrician,"
00:13:51,00:13:52,is called Henry Johnson.
00:13:52,00:13:53,"He's called Johnson, huh?"
00:13:53,00:13:58,And he was found unconscious in the street.
00:13:58,00:14:02,"And he'd been out for a drink, he got into a street car,"
00:14:02,00:14:03,"and he remembered nothing else after that,"
00:14:03,00:14:05,"but he was quite late, he'd been out,"
00:14:05,00:14:08,and his testicles had gone.
00:14:08,00:14:12,"And he may have been chloroformed or something like this,"
00:14:12,00:14:13,it's kind of hazy.
00:14:13,00:14:15,"He didn't report it to the police, apparently,"
00:14:15,00:14:18,he just went home and then went back to work.
00:14:18,00:14:19,- Wow.
00:14:19,00:14:20,- Really?
00:14:20,00:14:21,Yeah.
00:14:21,00:14:22,"- It was a different time,"
00:14:22,00:14:23,"you were stoic back then, wasn't it?"
00:14:23,00:14:26,(all laughing)
00:14:26,00:14:27,"- Oh, well, these things happen."
00:14:27,00:14:28,- Yeah.
00:14:28,00:14:31,"- It happened, it did happen, it happened."
00:14:31,00:14:33,"- It's such a hard thing to call in sick to your boss for,"
00:14:33,00:14:34,isn't it?
00:14:34,00:14:35,(all laughing)
00:14:35,00:14:37,I've lost my testicles.
00:14:37,00:14:39,(all laughing)
00:14:39,00:14:40,"- Pull the other one, I can't."
00:14:40,00:14:43,(all laughing)
00:14:43,00:14:48,"- The earliest report I could find on newspapers.com,"
00:14:48,00:14:51,which is like all the old American newspapers
00:14:51,00:14:52,that we go on sometimes.
00:14:52,00:14:56,"It was a Sioux City Journal on the 14th of October, 1922."
00:14:56,00:14:58,"Actually, it was the same report was in lots of them,"
00:14:58,00:14:59,but this was the first one that came up.
00:14:59,00:15:02,But the next story in the newspaper was about the son
00:15:02,00:15:05,"of Leo Tolstoy, who had lost his family jewels."
00:15:05,00:15:06,- No.
00:15:06,00:15:07,(all laughing)
00:15:07,00:15:08,- That is very good.
00:15:08,00:15:09,"- It's not cool, yeah, yeah."
00:15:09,00:15:10,- That's really cool.
00:15:10,00:15:11,- That's gotta be some deliberate editorial decision
00:15:11,00:15:12,"making there, I love that."
00:15:12,00:15:13,"- Here's a question, right?"
00:15:13,00:15:15,Do you think this actually happened?
00:15:15,00:15:18,Or do you think it was a medi-uppy thing?
00:15:18,00:15:18,- Oh.
00:15:18,00:15:20,- It definitely became a panic.
00:15:20,00:15:21,- The rock?
00:15:21,00:15:22,- Yeah.
00:15:22,00:15:24,"- The stories were a bit, so you were talking"
00:15:24,00:15:29,"about Henry Johnson, and he came to explain"
00:15:29,00:15:31,that he was missing his testicles off the back
00:15:31,00:15:33,of a different person first revealing it.
00:15:33,00:15:36,"So it's like he didn't tell anyone, press-wise,"
00:15:36,00:15:39,"but there was a guy called Joseph Wozniak who told,"
00:15:39,00:15:40,"and then other people came out and said,"
00:15:40,00:15:42,"""Me me too, my balls were taken."""
00:15:42,00:15:45,And Johnson was one of them.
00:15:45,00:15:47,"But the report that I read,"
00:15:47,00:15:49,"the article that you sent round to us,"
00:15:49,00:15:51,it said he discovered that one or both
00:15:51,00:15:54,of his testicles were missing.
00:15:54,00:15:55,And that's a curious thing to say.
00:15:55,00:15:57,- Was that Wozniak?
00:15:57,00:15:59,"- Yeah, there were different standards"
00:15:59,00:16:01,of self-care back in the day.
00:16:01,00:16:02,- Right.
00:16:02,00:16:03,- Yeah.
00:16:03,00:16:05,- 'Cause I was equally confused by his story.
00:16:05,00:16:06,"In the article that I read about him,"
00:16:06,00:16:08,it said that all that happened was he woke
00:16:08,00:16:10,"in the streets not remembering how he got there,"
00:16:10,00:16:12,"horrible taste in his mouth, chloroform,"
00:16:12,00:16:15,"pain in his groin, got through the day,"
00:16:15,00:16:18,and then went to hospital where the doctor discovered
00:16:18,00:16:19,"his testicles had been removed,"
00:16:19,00:16:22,which I would have thought you would have realized.
00:16:22,00:16:24,"- But it'd be swollen, you'd be uncomfortable,"
00:16:24,00:16:27,maybe you might not be analyzing yourself properly.
00:16:27,00:16:28,"- You'd be bandaged as well, right?"
00:16:28,00:16:29,Presumably.
00:16:29,00:16:30,"- Well, you bandaged."
00:16:30,00:16:32,"No, I think this is before he's gone to the hospital."
00:16:32,00:16:35,"- No, there's been other cases, I think,"
00:16:35,00:16:38,where the people who were removing the testicles
00:16:38,00:16:40,bandaged up because they weren't trying to kill people.
00:16:40,00:16:42,They just wanted their testicles.
00:16:42,00:16:45,"- Wait, sorry, do you think you'd be so uncurious"
00:16:45,00:16:46,that if you woke up on the street
00:16:46,00:16:48,"and you had a big old bandage around your crotch,"
00:16:48,00:16:51,"you'd just go, ""You know what, I'm not gonna touch it."
00:16:51,00:16:52,"""I'm not gonna touch it."
00:16:52,00:16:54,"""It's none of my business."""
00:16:54,00:16:56,(laughing)
00:16:56,00:17:01,- It kind of gets in the heart of it.
00:17:01,00:17:02,- It's so hard to tell.
00:17:02,00:17:04,"I think it may have happened to one or two people,"
00:17:04,00:17:05,but not to all of them.
00:17:05,00:17:08,"So, for example, there was a guy who,"
00:17:08,00:17:10,a young man called John Powell.
00:17:10,00:17:12,"This was in 1923, there were a couple more cases of it,"
00:17:12,00:17:14,"or certainly a ledge case in 1923,"
00:17:14,00:17:16,"a young man called John Powell,"
00:17:16,00:17:18,who was allegedly assaulted by three men
00:17:18,00:17:20,"wearing white lab coats, who were shouting,"
00:17:20,00:17:25,"""We need a gland,"" and I don't know if that is true,"
00:17:25,00:17:27,but it was true that the authorities took it seriously.
00:17:27,00:17:30,"They promised to charge gland banditry,"
00:17:30,00:17:32,"genuinely the phrase that was used to refer to it,"
00:17:32,00:17:35,"they made it a special crime, that was the crime of mayhem."
00:17:35,00:17:37,They sort of included gland banditry in the charge
00:17:37,00:17:39,of mayhem so you could get 14 years in prison
00:17:39,00:17:43,"if you were found guilty of it, so there were responses."
00:17:43,00:17:45,"- I think the evidence that I could find,"
00:17:45,00:17:47,"so a few things is, first of all,"
00:17:47,00:17:50,it's really hard to use chloroform to knock someone out.
00:17:50,00:17:52,There's technically really a difficult thing to do.
00:17:52,00:17:54,"- So in movies when we see that,"
00:17:54,00:17:54,that takes a couple of minutes.
00:17:54,00:17:56,"- Yeah, yeah, you would need to hold it over"
00:17:56,00:17:57,for like five or 10 minutes.
00:17:57,00:17:59,Often they would use other drugs as well.
00:17:59,00:18:02,"Sometimes, you know, there are ways of doing it."
00:18:02,00:18:04,You'd have to know what you're doing to get the right dose.
00:18:04,00:18:05,You'd have to hold their head up
00:18:05,00:18:07,so they don't swallow their tongue.
00:18:07,00:18:08,So that's a bit dodgy.
00:18:08,00:18:10,The other thing is all the articles
00:18:10,00:18:11,"warn about the dangers of liquor,"
00:18:11,00:18:13,and this was in the time of prohibition.
00:18:13,00:18:15,"So they're always saying, like,"
00:18:15,00:18:19,"""Oh, well, maybe sobriety and early hours"
00:18:19,00:18:21,"""would prevent much anguish for this person"
00:18:21,00:18:23,"""who lost his testicles,"" stuff like that."
00:18:23,00:18:25,- They're saying they were drunk.
00:18:25,00:18:26,"- They're saying that basically,"
00:18:26,00:18:28,"there's prohibition happening, you shouldn't be drinking,"
00:18:28,00:18:30,"but if you do drink, you might lose your bowls."
00:18:30,00:18:31,"So there's a bit of that there,"
00:18:31,00:18:35,but then one of the articles referenced a surgeon
00:18:35,00:18:37,"called Anthony Sigmund Sampolinsky,"
00:18:37,00:18:39,and I checked him and he definitely did exist.
00:18:39,00:18:41,"So, you know, there was definitely some stuff there"
00:18:41,00:18:43,"that was definitely real, so it's kind of weird."
00:18:43,00:18:45,- I don't know. - It's a really curious one.
00:18:45,00:18:48,The theory that was launched was that it was to...
00:18:48,00:18:51,This is the exact phrasing from the newspaper.
00:18:51,00:18:55,"It was possibly done to rejuvenate some wealthy ancient,"
00:18:55,00:18:59,i.e. an elderly millionaire wanted some pep.
00:18:59,00:19:02,"- But wait a minute, but that was happening, though, wasn't it?"
00:19:02,00:19:03,- But that's the weird thing.
00:19:03,00:19:05,"That definitely was happening at the time,"
00:19:05,00:19:06,"which lends credence to this,"
00:19:06,00:19:08,and maybe it was a panic off the back of the fact
00:19:08,00:19:10,that people were going around inserting testicles
00:19:10,00:19:11,into themselves.
00:19:11,00:19:13,"- Yeah, shove in Younger Man's testicles on yourself"
00:19:13,00:19:16,"when you will become his Younger Self,"
00:19:16,00:19:17,is what they thought.
00:19:17,00:19:18,"And then in Chicago, there was a famous doctor,"
00:19:18,00:19:22,"Dr. Lespinass, and he did, I think,"
00:19:22,00:19:25,one of the first successful testicle transplant ops
00:19:25,00:19:29,"in 1911, and this was actually for a man"
00:19:29,00:19:31,"who'd lost both his testicles,"
00:19:31,00:19:33,"weirdly, in two separate incidents."
00:19:33,00:19:34,- Stop.
00:19:34,00:19:36,Just don't go back to that place.
00:19:36,00:19:40,- Just resign your job at the archery range.
00:19:41,00:19:42,- So he's lost both--
00:19:42,00:19:43,- Two separate incidents.
00:19:43,00:19:44,"- Yeah, one was an accident,"
00:19:44,00:19:47,and then one was a botch-turnier operation.
00:19:47,00:19:48,"- Oh, that's terrible."
00:19:48,00:19:49,"- I know, it's very sad."
00:19:49,00:19:49,"- That's a real bit, that's a real bit."
00:19:49,00:19:50,- Sorry we made jokes about that.
00:19:50,00:19:52,"- But he had this surgery,"
00:19:52,00:19:55,"and so this is where the origin of the testicle transplant,"
00:19:55,00:19:56,giving you this amazing virility he came from.
00:19:56,00:19:57,"He had this surgery, and he said,"
00:19:57,00:20:00,"""After the surgery, he had a strong erection"
00:20:00,00:20:03,"""accompanied by marked sexual desire, so intense,"
00:20:03,00:20:06,"""he insisted on checking out of the hospital right away"
00:20:06,00:20:08,"""so he could satisfy it."""
00:20:08,00:20:10,"- Wow. - And so his doctor was like,"
00:20:10,00:20:13,"""Wow, I found this amazing new thing for you guys."""
00:20:13,00:20:15,"- And that was the guy in Chicago, right?"
00:20:15,00:20:16,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:20:16,00:20:19,"- And these things were in Chicago as well, right?"
00:20:19,00:20:21,"- Yeah, exactly. - These testicle thefts."
00:20:21,00:20:24,"And in the same year as these thefts happened,"
00:20:24,00:20:26,"there was a very, very famous example"
00:20:26,00:20:30,"of the richest man in Chicago who's called Harold McCormick,"
00:20:30,00:20:32,"and he underwent some kind of surgery,"
00:20:32,00:20:34,"and they never said what it was,"
00:20:34,00:20:35,but all the press was certain
00:20:35,00:20:38,that he was getting bowls put into his bowls.
00:20:38,00:20:40,"Everyone was so sure he was gonna do it,"
00:20:40,00:20:42,and it was Lesbian Ass again who was doing it.
00:20:42,00:20:44,"And the thing was, he had just married this woman"
00:20:44,00:20:47,"called Gana Valska, who was an opera singer"
00:20:47,00:20:49,"who was much, much younger than him."
00:20:49,00:20:50,"She was very, very famous."
00:20:50,00:20:53,Her first four husbands had been worth a total
00:20:53,00:20:55,of $125 million.
00:20:55,00:20:56,- First four?
00:20:56,00:20:57,"- Yeah, he was her fifth."
00:20:57,00:21:00,"- That's going it. - That's going some, right?"
00:21:00,00:21:03,"But then he married her, and the idea was that he thought"
00:21:03,00:21:05,he'd never be able to keep up with her
00:21:05,00:21:07,if he didn't have this operation.
00:21:07,00:21:08,"She was amazing, by the way."
00:21:08,00:21:10,"After she divorced McCormick,"
00:21:10,00:21:12,she married a guy called Harry Mathews
00:21:12,00:21:15,who claimed to have created a death ray.
00:21:15,00:21:17,- Cool. - This is the most amazing
00:21:17,00:21:19,woman I've never heard of.
00:21:19,00:21:22,"He was British, this guy, it was in 1924."
00:21:22,00:21:24,"He told everyone that he'd invented this death ray,"
00:21:24,00:21:26,"and the government said, ""Oh, can we have a look at it?"""
00:21:26,00:21:29,"And he went, ""Well, give me some money first."""
00:21:29,00:21:30,"And they went, ""Well, we're not gonna do that."""
00:21:30,00:21:32,"He went, ""All right, I'm going to France then."""
00:21:32,00:21:34,"And he said he was gonna go away,"
00:21:34,00:21:37,and there was a law made to stop him
00:21:37,00:21:39,"from going and selling his death ray,"
00:21:39,00:21:41,which obviously didn't exist to the French
00:21:41,00:21:43,and to the other people. - That's so funny.
00:21:43,00:21:44,- Wow. - Yeah.
00:21:44,00:21:45,- So what was her type?
00:21:45,00:21:47,"It's hard, like, just weirdos?"
00:21:47,00:21:49,"- Very, very rich men to start off with."
00:21:49,00:21:53,Then men with testicles put into their testicles.
00:21:53,00:21:56,"Then death ray guys, and then she ended up"
00:21:56,00:21:58,with a yoga teacher.
00:21:58,00:22:00,- The obvious end point.
00:22:00,00:22:01,"- Anna, I don't think the 1911 guy"
00:22:01,00:22:03,"was actually the very first,"
00:22:03,00:22:04,'cause I think there was a previous doctor called
00:22:04,00:22:07,"Charles-Edward Brown-Sequod. - Yeah, he was in my band."
00:22:07,00:22:09,"- So in the 1880s, he was convinced"
00:22:09,00:22:12,that you could reverse your aging.
00:22:12,00:22:13,"He was a brilliant doctor, by the way."
00:22:13,00:22:15,He genuinely was a great doctor.
00:22:15,00:22:16,He worked on the spinal cord
00:22:16,00:22:18,and revolutionized our understanding of it.
00:22:18,00:22:23,"But he also, okay, he started injecting himself"
00:22:23,00:22:25,"not only with human seed,"
00:22:25,00:22:28,but he started with dog and guinea pig seed.
00:22:28,00:22:31,"- Mm, guinea pig seed. - Mixed up with blood"
00:22:31,00:22:34,"just to really, you know, make it weirder."
00:22:34,00:22:36,"- And he claimed, he was in his early 70s at the time,"
00:22:36,00:22:38,"and he said, ""This has done me a power of good."""
00:22:38,00:22:41,- All I do all day is run around in a wheel.
00:22:41,00:22:42,(laughing)
00:22:42,00:22:45,- He claimed his eyes had improved.
00:22:45,00:22:46,He could see better.
00:22:46,00:22:47,"He could run up and down stairs again,"
00:22:47,00:22:49,which he hadn't done for years.
00:22:49,00:22:52,He claimed he could lift 15 pounds more than previously.
00:22:52,00:22:56,And he claimed the average length of his jet of urine
00:22:56,00:22:58,had increased by 25%.
00:22:58,00:23:00,- Okay. - All thanks to guinea pig.
00:23:00,00:23:02,- That's what you want. - You stood next to him
00:23:02,00:23:03,"and said, ""Are you riding on it?"
00:23:03,00:23:04,"""He's three feet behind you."""
00:23:04,00:23:05,(laughing)
00:23:05,00:23:07,- And the operation go.
00:23:07,00:23:09,- So you ride all punches through the wall.
00:23:09,00:23:11,(laughing)
00:23:11,00:23:13,"- That's amazing. - And that set off,"
00:23:13,00:23:14,"'cause I think we've mentioned him before,"
00:23:14,00:23:17,and guinea pig testicle transplants became a big thing.
00:23:17,00:23:21,"But that set off a big wave of kind of transplanting,"
00:23:21,00:23:23,other experiments with other animal testicle transplants.
00:23:23,00:23:26,"And so, there was a surgeon called Serge Voronoff,"
00:23:26,00:23:27,"and his wife, Mrs. Voronoff,"
00:23:27,00:23:30,"Dr. and Mrs. Voronoff, who became very famous"
00:23:30,00:23:33,for implanting monkey testicles into men.
00:23:33,00:23:35,"And what they would do is,"
00:23:35,00:23:37,"they'd remove the monkey testicle,"
00:23:37,00:23:38,"cut it into segments,"
00:23:38,00:23:40,and then they'd make an incision
00:23:40,00:23:41,"in the scrotum of the human,"
00:23:41,00:23:46,and then they would slot one of the segments into that.
00:23:46,00:23:47,- Okay. - Like squeezing
00:23:47,00:23:49,an extra slice into a cake sort of thing.
00:23:49,00:23:51,- Or a chocolate orange kind of thing.
00:23:51,00:23:53,"- Oh, wow. - Yes, yeah, yeah."
00:23:53,00:23:54,"- And how many times would you,"
00:23:54,00:23:57,"I just, I'm trying to picture a millionaire"
00:23:57,00:24:01,"walking around with 16 testicles worth of testicles in there,"
00:24:01,00:24:04,"like, just adding to it, just really indulging."
00:24:04,00:24:06,"- It's a good job they don't do it anymore, isn't it?"
00:24:06,00:24:08,"Can you imagine, like, I don't know,"
00:24:08,00:24:11,"Mark Zuckerberg walking around with, like,"
00:24:11,00:24:14,"200,000 testicles dragging behind them?"
00:24:14,00:24:15,"- Well, the names we're mentioning"
00:24:15,00:24:18,"are quite obscure names from history,"
00:24:18,00:24:19,but there is one name that sticks out
00:24:19,00:24:22,who supposedly had monkey testicle injections
00:24:22,00:24:24,"into his own nut bag,"
00:24:24,00:24:28,"and that is W.B. Yates, the poet."
00:24:28,00:24:31,- Oh. - Supposedly he had this done.
00:24:31,00:24:36,"And, yeah, I mean, and he was very sex-crazy"
00:24:36,00:24:37,into his later life.
00:24:37,00:24:40,"He supposedly was going to Harley Street in London,"
00:24:40,00:24:41,and he was having these things.
00:24:41,00:24:42,It was all rumours.
00:24:42,00:24:44,"We weren't, I don't think it's been fully confirmed,"
00:24:44,00:24:47,"but he had multiple affairs in the final,"
00:24:47,00:24:48,about twilight years of his life.
00:24:48,00:24:50,"- And he was a weirdo, yeah, essentially."
00:24:50,00:24:52,He was into some freaky shit.
00:24:52,00:24:53,"So I believe it. - The occult and stuff, yeah."
00:24:53,00:24:55,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:24:55,00:24:58,"Apparently, if you have your,"
00:24:58,00:25:01,"let's say a testicle falls out of you,"
00:25:01,00:25:02,you have-- - Let's just say.
00:25:02,00:25:03,"- Let's just say scenario,"
00:25:03,00:25:05,"you're going home tonight here in Poole,"
00:25:05,00:25:07,"and whoop, my testicle's fallen out."
00:25:07,00:25:09,You have between four to six hours
00:25:09,00:25:11,of getting it back inside. - That's ages.
00:25:11,00:25:13,- You must have to keep it on ice
00:25:13,00:25:14,"in the meantime, I should think."
00:25:14,00:25:17,"- Yeah, exactly, so we did Richard Herring's podcast"
00:25:17,00:25:21,"not too long ago, and Richard Herring, sadly, very,"
00:25:21,00:25:24,"he's absolutely fine, but he had testicular cancer"
00:25:24,00:25:25,and he had a testicle removed.
00:25:25,00:25:27,"He asked us to find some facts about it,"
00:25:27,00:25:28,and one of the things that I found out
00:25:28,00:25:33,was that a testicle transplant had happened
00:25:33,00:25:36,"in recent years between two identical twins,"
00:25:36,00:25:40,"one of whom was born with the testicles, just two,"
00:25:40,00:25:43,"but the other was missing them entirely,"
00:25:43,00:25:45,and they were able to transplant a testicle
00:25:45,00:25:48,"to the brother, and they were in their 30s,"
00:25:48,00:25:51,"and it was a doctor called Dr. Dickon Coe,"
00:25:51,00:25:56,"and Dr. Dickon was able to successfully transplant it,"
00:25:56,00:25:59,and it was great because you were transplanting it
00:25:59,00:26:00,basically to the same body.
00:26:00,00:26:02,"- 'Cause it's genetically, we're identical twins."
00:26:02,00:26:06,"- Yeah, exactly, yeah, but four to six hours is roughly--"
00:26:06,00:26:07,- Do you mean four to six hours
00:26:07,00:26:09,during which the testicle will still be viable?
00:26:09,00:26:11,"- Yes. - Okay, so when you said"
00:26:11,00:26:13,"if your testicle falls out, you know,"
00:26:13,00:26:15,"you do have to sort of sew up the wound and stuff,"
00:26:15,00:26:16,"and you just mean the testicle,"
00:26:16,00:26:18,"you'll still be able to reattach it,"
00:26:18,00:26:19,"and it will still function. - Yes, and it will still function"
00:26:19,00:26:22,"as a transplanted object of the body, yeah."
00:26:22,00:26:23,"- If it's happening now,"
00:26:23,00:26:25,"you can stay 'til the end of the show,"
00:26:25,00:26:26,and you still have bags of time.
00:26:26,00:26:28,"- Yeah, I'll say bags."
00:26:28,00:26:32,- We need to move on to our next fact.
00:26:32,00:26:37,"It is time for fact number three, and that is Anna."
00:26:37,00:26:41,"- Yes, my fact this week is that until 2016,"
00:26:41,00:26:45,the Indian government earned $10 million a year
00:26:45,00:26:48,"from a single tiger, pretty impressive tiger."
00:26:48,00:26:51,- How do you make so much money from a tiger?
00:26:51,00:26:52,- It just worked really hard.
00:26:52,00:26:56,"No, this was a tiger called Machli, very famous tiger,"
00:26:56,00:27:00,"big celebrity in India, and Bengal Tigress, in fact,"
00:27:00,00:27:05,and she just became famous for being impressive
00:27:05,00:27:07,"and hardcore, lasting a long time."
00:27:07,00:27:10,"She did, she was constantly defeating the odds,"
00:27:10,00:27:14,so she would fight lots of much bigger male tigers
00:27:14,00:27:16,"for territory, she had one very famous altercation"
00:27:16,00:27:20,"with a 14 foot crocodile that weighed twice as much of her,"
00:27:20,00:27:23,"which, again, she had a real eye for PR"
00:27:23,00:27:25,because she always did this in front of tourists.
00:27:25,00:27:28,"So whenever a safari load of people came around,"
00:27:28,00:27:30,"then suddenly she'd do something incredible,"
00:27:30,00:27:33,"like kill a crocodile, which is a great pose,"
00:27:33,00:27:34,a very photogenic.
00:27:34,00:27:36,"And so, yeah, raked in money for the government,"
00:27:36,00:27:37,the state government.
00:27:37,00:27:38,- For just people visiting to see her.
00:27:38,00:27:41,"- Exactly, yeah, estimated the number of people"
00:27:41,00:27:43,who just booked their holiday for her.
00:27:43,00:27:45,- I read that she won a Lifetime Achievement Award
00:27:45,00:27:46,for being a tiger.
00:27:46,00:27:48,(laughing)
00:27:48,00:27:50,"- That's not that difficult, is it?"
00:27:50,00:27:53,"Like, she is a tiger, so surely every tiger"
00:27:53,00:27:54,has a lifetime of being a tiger.
00:27:54,00:27:56,"- But I don't know, I don't think they do."
00:27:56,00:27:57,- Who was the award from?
00:27:57,00:28:00,"- Well, it wasn't BAFTA, I don't know exactly."
00:28:00,00:28:01,"Sorry, I didn't know who it was,"
00:28:01,00:28:03,it was Travel Operators for Tigers.
00:28:03,00:28:06,"- Oh, but yeah, you really won that one, don't you?"
00:28:06,00:28:08,- It's not the fucking Oscars.
00:28:08,00:28:08,"- I know, but--"
00:28:08,00:28:10,- Probably the Oscars for tigers.
00:28:10,00:28:11,"- It may very well be-- - Exactly, yes."
00:28:11,00:28:14,- It's very dangerous to have that award at the Oscars.
00:28:14,00:28:15,That's a health and safety nightmare.
00:28:15,00:28:17,"Like, what dressing room do they use?"
00:28:17,00:28:18,It wouldn't work.
00:28:18,00:28:20,- The carpet would be read by the end of the Oscars.
00:28:20,00:28:22,- That's true.
00:28:22,00:28:24,"- But yeah, she was super cool,"
00:28:24,00:28:26,and she was so valuable to the government
00:28:26,00:28:28,"that in the end, her life was extended,"
00:28:28,00:28:29,"so she died when she was 19,"
00:28:29,00:28:32,which was very old for a wild tiger.
00:28:32,00:28:33,They'd usually die when they're 15.
00:28:33,00:28:36,But one of the reasons that she died so old
00:28:36,00:28:39,"is because she lost a few of her teeth,"
00:28:39,00:28:40,"she lost her canines,"
00:28:40,00:28:41,"but actually she lost one eye,"
00:28:41,00:28:43,'cause she was always in these fights.
00:28:43,00:28:46,And it was thought then that she was so valuable
00:28:46,00:28:48,"to the state, and people would be so devastated"
00:28:48,00:28:49,"if she sort of starved to death,"
00:28:49,00:28:51,"'cause she lost her teeth,"
00:28:51,00:28:54,"that the state started leaving meat for her,"
00:28:54,00:28:57,"a sort of tethered goat out in the wild,"
00:28:57,00:28:58,"so they didn't take her-- - And they were like alive,"
00:28:58,00:28:59,"weren't they, the goats?"
00:28:59,00:29:02,"- Yes, yeah, so they didn't take her into captivity."
00:29:02,00:29:03,"They just left her in the wild,"
00:29:03,00:29:04,but with a nice tethered goat.
00:29:04,00:29:05,"She must have thought that, I don't know,"
00:29:05,00:29:08,Christmas would come every single day.
00:29:08,00:29:10,- She must have thought that goats have got a bit stupid.
00:29:10,00:29:11,- Yeah.
00:29:11,00:29:12,- Was the money purely from people
00:29:12,00:29:15,"visiting the place that she resided,"
00:29:15,00:29:18,"or was she, okay, so she wasn't doing like Pepsi ads,"
00:29:18,00:29:21,"or like, she wasn't on T-shirts and merch?"
00:29:21,00:29:22,"- No, she's very principled."
00:29:22,00:29:24,She didn't believe in selling out and things like that.
00:29:24,00:29:26,She just wanted to be herself.
00:29:26,00:29:27,"- I'm sure, definitely merch."
00:29:27,00:29:28,There must have been merch.
00:29:28,00:29:30,"- Actually, there's just shed loads of merch, yeah."
00:29:30,00:29:32,"Her images, she was on a stamp,"
00:29:32,00:29:33,which her painting is everywhere
00:29:33,00:29:35,if you go to train stations in India.
00:29:35,00:29:37,And this is up in Rajasthan in an actual park.
00:29:37,00:29:38,"- Oh, is she painted?"
00:29:38,00:29:38,"Okay, yeah."
00:29:38,00:29:39,"- Yeah, it's impressive."
00:29:39,00:29:42,"It's mostly paw prints, but it's impressive nonetheless."
00:29:42,00:29:44,- And she was the most photographed tiger
00:29:44,00:29:45,in the world as well.
00:29:45,00:29:47,"- That's pretty amazing, isn't it?"
00:29:47,00:29:49,"- Yeah, she had an amazing funeral"
00:29:49,00:29:51,because she was so kind of worshipped.
00:29:51,00:29:54,"So, in fact, all, I didn't realize this,"
00:29:54,00:29:57,all leopards and tigers are cremated in India
00:29:57,00:29:59,"when they die, or in international parks like this."
00:29:59,00:30:01,And that is so that their skins can't be taken
00:30:01,00:30:03,"and sold on the black market,"
00:30:03,00:30:06,'cause obviously that encourages that.
00:30:06,00:30:08,"But, so she was cremated."
00:30:08,00:30:10,"But first, it's very cool, and there's a video of this."
00:30:10,00:30:12,She was given a traditional Hindu funeral.
00:30:12,00:30:15,"So she was wrapped up in white linen,"
00:30:15,00:30:18,"and you can just see her little head, quite big head,"
00:30:18,00:30:18,"poking out above it,"
00:30:18,00:30:21,"and then covered in lovely red flowers,"
00:30:21,00:30:23,and then carried on a kind of a funeral beer
00:30:23,00:30:27,"by lots of the park guards to this, to this pire."
00:30:27,00:30:28,"- That's amazing, so cool."
00:30:28,00:30:30,"- Yeah, it's quite a beautiful ceremony."
00:30:30,00:30:30,- Yeah.
00:30:30,00:30:33,"Can I tell you, there's just a random tiger fact"
00:30:33,00:30:35,that I found quite cool.
00:30:35,00:30:40,"So, the MGM, the movies, right at the beginning,"
00:30:40,00:30:44,"you've got the big lion that's through the thing, big roar."
00:30:44,00:30:47,"So, in the 80s, there was a sound designer"
00:30:47,00:30:49,"called Mike Mangini,"
00:30:49,00:30:54,"who was working on ambient sounds for the movie ""Poltergeist."""
00:30:54,00:30:54,"And while he was doing it,"
00:30:54,00:30:56,"he collected a lot of different sounds,"
00:30:56,00:30:58,including tiger sounds.
00:30:58,00:31:00,"And he sent that to the people at MGM saying,"
00:31:00,00:31:02,"have a listen to these roars,"
00:31:02,00:31:04,'cause they're really quite more striking
00:31:04,00:31:07,than you have for your current lion
00:31:07,00:31:09,that is doing the MGM roar.
00:31:09,00:31:12,"So, when you hear that roar at the beginning of a movie,"
00:31:12,00:31:14,the lion is lip-syncing.
00:31:14,00:31:18,"It's a tiger's roar, it's not a lion's roar."
00:31:18,00:31:21,"Lions apparently don't have quite that boomy,"
00:31:21,00:31:24,"amazing roar that a tiger has, so yeah."
00:31:24,00:31:25,"So, it's dope."
00:31:25,00:31:25,- Interesting.
00:31:25,00:31:29,Another Hollywood tiger would be Mike Tyson's tigers.
00:31:29,00:31:30,- Oh yeah.
00:31:30,00:31:30,- He used to have tigers.
00:31:30,00:31:32,"Is it in the hangover, he has some tigers,"
00:31:32,00:31:35,but that's actually in real life he used to have tigers.
00:31:35,00:31:36,He doesn't have them anymore.
00:31:36,00:31:39,Any ideas why he doesn't have them anymore?
00:31:39,00:31:40,- Did they escape?
00:31:40,00:31:42,"- They did not escape, no."
00:31:42,00:31:44,- Did he beat them up?
00:31:44,00:31:45,"- It's illegal to have tigers,"
00:31:45,00:31:46,and he shouldn't have put them in the movie
00:31:46,00:31:48,'cause that told everyone he had them.
00:31:48,00:31:49,"- Sadly, quite legal to have tigers"
00:31:49,00:31:50,in some parts of America.
00:31:50,00:31:51,"- Oh, is it, okay."
00:31:51,00:31:53,"- And he didn't beat them up, Anna, no."
00:31:53,00:31:56,It's because they smell so much and fart so much.
00:31:56,00:31:57,- Really?
00:31:57,00:31:58,"- Apparently, he got married,"
00:31:58,00:32:00,and his wife didn't want them in the house
00:32:00,00:32:02,"because when they fart, they smell like hell."
00:32:02,00:32:05,"- Right, and now the tigers are gone."
00:32:05,00:32:07,"She's like, ""Why is that smell still here, Mike?"
00:32:07,00:32:08,"""What?"""
00:32:08,00:32:10,- And there's tiger that we're talking about
00:32:10,00:32:12,"at the start, muchly, right?"
00:32:12,00:32:15,"So she was blind in one eye,"
00:32:15,00:32:19,"and I thought I'd look at kind of tiger opticians,"
00:32:19,00:32:21,and I found one.
00:32:21,00:32:24,"There is a person who is a tiger optician,"
00:32:24,00:32:27,"a veterinarian, really, Tammy Miller,"
00:32:27,00:32:29,and she says there is one big problem
00:32:29,00:32:33,with doing optician stuff on big cats.
00:32:33,00:32:34,Can you think of what that might be?
00:32:34,00:32:38,"- They're massive tigers, and they'll eat your face."
00:32:38,00:32:40,"- A bit of that, but there's something else."
00:32:40,00:32:45,"- Ooh, they can't administer medicine to themselves."
00:32:45,00:32:46,- They can't put contact lenses in.
00:32:46,00:32:48,You scratch your eyes.
00:32:48,00:32:49,- These are all great answers.
00:32:49,00:32:51,"According to her, the big problem"
00:32:51,00:32:55,"is that they really hold a grudge, and so..."
00:32:55,00:32:57,- How are we gonna work that out?
00:32:57,00:32:58,"- Oh, wow."
00:32:58,00:33:00,"- How did you not get that out of that, come on?"
00:33:00,00:33:05,"And the thing was, is basically when you do the work on them,"
00:33:05,00:33:07,"it's obviously not very pleasant for them,"
00:33:07,00:33:09,"but then later on you need to go and do a bit more work on them,"
00:33:09,00:33:11,and they are not happy.
00:33:11,00:33:14,"They remember what you did, and they will not let you near them."
00:33:14,00:33:14,"But what I thought is,"
00:33:14,00:33:17,do you know that there's a kid's story
00:33:17,00:33:19,"about the lion who gets a thorn in the paw,"
00:33:19,00:33:21,"and then you help them,"
00:33:21,00:33:23,and then they're always your friend forever?
00:33:23,00:33:24,Not realistic.
00:33:24,00:33:26,"- No, okay."
00:33:26,00:33:27,"- Yeah, why aren't they grateful?"
00:33:27,00:33:29,- They can see again.
00:33:29,00:33:31,"- I thought you meant, when you said,"
00:33:31,00:33:32,"and then the next time you see them,"
00:33:32,00:33:34,"I thought you meant the grudge extended to them,"
00:33:34,00:33:36,sort of like sitting in cafes with coats
00:33:36,00:33:38,"on trying to get back at you,"
00:33:38,00:33:40,"like they're tracking you down, but no, it's..."
00:33:40,00:33:42,"- No, it's just the next time they see you."
00:33:42,00:33:45,"And this was, it was a time when they did some work"
00:33:45,00:33:49,"on a big cat called Indira,"
00:33:49,00:33:52,and that basically they anesthetized them and did this work.
00:33:52,00:33:55,"But when you anesthetize one of these cats,"
00:33:55,00:33:57,then you obviously have to do quite a lot of work on them
00:33:57,00:33:58,at the same time.
00:33:58,00:33:59,"You might as well, 'cause it's quite dangerous"
00:33:59,00:34:01,"to anesthetize these animals,"
00:34:01,00:34:03,so you might as well do as much as possible.
00:34:03,00:34:05,I just say that because I really liked it
00:34:05,00:34:09,"because they did an MRI, an ultrasound, and a cat scan."
00:34:09,00:34:10,- Nice.
00:34:10,00:34:11,(laughing)
00:34:11,00:34:14,"- Listen, we need to move on to our final fact."
00:34:14,00:34:16,"It is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:34:16,00:34:17,and that is my fact.
00:34:17,00:34:22,My fact this week is that St. Michael's Church in Bournemouth
00:34:22,00:34:26,has been renamed St. Mike's to make it seem
00:34:26,00:34:27,younger and cooler.
00:34:27,00:34:29,(laughing)
00:34:29,00:34:31,So this is a genuine thing.
00:34:31,00:34:34,We're playing live in pool tonight.
00:34:34,00:34:36,"Bournemouth is just down the road,"
00:34:36,00:34:40,and it's a 148 year old church.
00:34:40,00:34:44,"The Reverend Sarah Yetman believes that by changing the name,"
00:34:44,00:34:48,"it's gonna be, you know, a nice hipper place to have"
00:34:48,00:34:51,"groovy kids come in, listen to their record players."
00:34:51,00:34:52,- Is it working?
00:34:52,00:34:54,"Do we think, I mean, Mike isn't that cool a name anyway."
00:34:54,00:34:57,"I mean, apologies to any mikes in the audience."
00:34:57,00:35:00,It doesn't feel like it's one of the top 10 names these days.
00:35:00,00:35:03,"- No, I mean, but I guess it is just shorter than Michael."
00:35:03,00:35:05,"It's not like, you know, St. Dave's."
00:35:05,00:35:08,I think it's a bit hard to just change saints all together.
00:35:08,00:35:11,"I wonder if this is gonna stick,"
00:35:11,00:35:13,"'cause there has been backlash with people saying,"
00:35:13,00:35:15,"come on, we can't start, you know,"
00:35:15,00:35:17,St. David's can't be St. Dave's.
00:35:17,00:35:20,We can't suddenly just change the names of saints
00:35:20,00:35:21,of our churches.
00:35:21,00:35:22,- Where does it end?
00:35:22,00:35:23,- It's a slippery slope.
00:35:23,00:35:26,You'll have St. Twat's wagon that people go to worship in.
00:35:26,00:35:28,- It's a Twat's wagon.
00:35:28,00:35:31,"- Oh God, it's, where does it end?"
00:35:31,00:35:32,- He's in the Apocrypha.
00:35:32,00:35:35,"He's not one of the main 12, but he is there, yeah."
00:35:35,00:35:38,"St. Jude, I guess for St. Judas,"
00:35:38,00:35:39,probably actually there isn't a St. Judas there.
00:35:39,00:35:41,"- There isn't a Judas there, isn't it?"
00:35:41,00:35:42,"- There were two Judases, weren't there?"
00:35:42,00:35:43,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:35:43,00:35:43,- Great.
00:35:43,00:35:44,- Like when you do get St. Jude's?
00:35:44,00:35:48,"- Yeah, but not St. Twat's, I think we could all agree."
00:35:48,00:35:49,- Yeah.
00:35:49,00:35:51,"- I don't mind it changing its name, I have to say."
00:35:51,00:35:53,It's had a refurbishment.
00:35:53,00:35:56,They've opened up a coffee bar as part of that
00:35:56,00:35:59,"to offer a school drop off and so, you know,"
00:35:59,00:36:01,get the kids in and so on.
00:36:01,00:36:02,"I don't know, it's funny though."
00:36:02,00:36:03,"It is, yeah."
00:36:03,00:36:04,"- Yeah, it's really cool."
00:36:04,00:36:06,I think it's great when churches do this.
00:36:06,00:36:08,"And there's a big push, although there always has been"
00:36:08,00:36:11,from the church to try and rejuvenate itself.
00:36:11,00:36:13,"And I think there was a building,"
00:36:13,00:36:16,"a church building review group in 2016,"
00:36:16,00:36:17,"which is looking at all these big stone,"
00:36:17,00:36:19,"like beautiful edifices we have,"
00:36:19,00:36:22,which are empty just all the time these days.
00:36:22,00:36:24,And it was looking at how to repurpose them.
00:36:24,00:36:25,"And so now you get cool stuff,"
00:36:25,00:36:29,like St. Paul's Church in Bristol is now a circus school.
00:36:29,00:36:30,"And if you look at pictures of it,"
00:36:30,00:36:33,it's got like trapeze-wise and high-wise hung from the ceiling
00:36:33,00:36:35,and people swinging all around it.
00:36:35,00:36:36,- Wow.
00:36:36,00:36:36,- It's great.
00:36:36,00:36:39,There's about a dozen churches that are chomping sites.
00:36:39,00:36:40,- Whating?
00:36:40,00:36:41,- Chomping.
00:36:41,00:36:41,- Church camping.
00:36:41,00:36:43,- Oh my God.
00:36:43,00:36:44,- I've camped in a church.
00:36:44,00:36:45,- Have you?
00:36:45,00:36:46,- Yeah.
00:36:46,00:36:46,- How come?
00:36:46,00:36:47,"- Yeah, a church hall."
00:36:47,00:36:48,- Really?
00:36:48,00:36:50,- For a fortnight when I was 17.
00:36:50,00:36:52,- Two weeks in a church?
00:36:52,00:36:53,- Yeah.
00:36:53,00:36:55,- Your parents really didn't get along with you today.
00:36:55,00:36:57,(laughing)
00:36:57,00:36:58,"- What, for any reason or?"
00:36:58,00:37:01,"- It was for, we were doing some sort of volunteering thing"
00:37:01,00:37:03,and you had to go and live in the church
00:37:03,00:37:06,and then take out the kids of the parish during the week.
00:37:06,00:37:08,- I did once sleep in a church in Northumberland.
00:37:08,00:37:09,"I must say, yeah."
00:37:09,00:37:12,"I was, we'd gone, we went on a walk"
00:37:12,00:37:13,'cause I went to a Catholic school.
00:37:13,00:37:16,We went on a walk and then we went to this little village
00:37:16,00:37:18,in Northumberland and we decided to play football
00:37:18,00:37:22,against these kids and they were so much rougher than us.
00:37:22,00:37:24,And basically it turned into a massive fight
00:37:24,00:37:28,"and when I say fight, it was them trying to beat us up"
00:37:28,00:37:29,and we legged it into the local church.
00:37:29,00:37:31,"It went, sanctuary, sanctuary."
00:37:31,00:37:33,(laughing)
00:37:33,00:37:36,- Did they tell you to piss off and fight the kids?
00:37:36,00:37:38,- We stayed in there overnight.
00:37:38,00:37:38,"- Oh, that's nice."
00:37:38,00:37:39,- Oh my God.
00:37:39,00:37:40,- That's cool.
00:37:40,00:37:43,Anyone else slept in a church or no?
00:37:43,00:37:45,"- No, not slept in a church."
00:37:45,00:37:47,- I probably nodded off in a few church services.
00:37:47,00:37:48,- Yeah.
00:37:48,00:37:50,- That counts.
00:37:50,00:37:52,- Have you heard of Stony Fort Community Church
00:37:52,00:37:53,in South Carolina?
00:37:53,00:37:54,- I don't believe so.
00:37:54,00:37:56,- It would be staggering if you had.
00:37:56,00:37:57,"These, I love these guys so much."
00:37:57,00:37:58,They have also changed their name.
00:37:58,00:37:59,They're a church.
00:37:59,00:38:04,"And until 2020, they were called Outbreak Church"
00:38:04,00:38:06,"and then they found themselves think,"
00:38:06,00:38:08,and it was set up in 2013.
00:38:08,00:38:10,The vicar called Scott Carroll
00:38:10,00:38:11,articulated his mission as follows.
00:38:11,00:38:13,"He said, ""I want to be around people"
00:38:13,00:38:15,"""who are so infected with Jesus"
00:38:15,00:38:19,"""that every time they turn around, they sneeze Jesus."""
00:38:19,00:38:20,And sneezes.
00:38:20,00:38:21,- Yes.
00:38:21,00:38:22,- Sneezes Christ.
00:38:22,00:38:25,"Every time they talked about the church,"
00:38:25,00:38:29,"they talked about contagion and infection and epidemic,"
00:38:29,00:38:32,"they made bracelets and shirts with the phrase,"
00:38:32,00:38:33,"""Are you contagious?"""
00:38:33,00:38:35,"And people would read them and say,"
00:38:35,00:38:36,"""Contagious with what?"""
00:38:36,00:38:37,"And they'd say, ""Jesus."""
00:38:37,00:38:41,"And he says, ""This was really fun"
00:38:41,00:38:44,"""until for some reason, early 2020, stop being funny."""
00:38:44,00:38:47,(audience laughing)
00:38:47,00:38:51,- I was having a look at the Reverend Richard Coles'
00:38:51,00:38:53,"autobiography, a biography."
00:38:53,00:38:56,"And he was saying, it was just a throwaway line"
00:38:56,00:38:57,that I then looked into.
00:38:57,00:39:00,He was saying that a lot of vicar's have funny names
00:39:00,00:39:04,"and he was saying he knew someone who insisted on everyone,"
00:39:04,00:39:07,"even bishops, calling them the Reverend Gazz."
00:39:07,00:39:08,"And so then I thought,"
00:39:08,00:39:09,"""I wonder what funny names there have been"
00:39:09,00:39:10,"""in the church over the years?"""
00:39:10,00:39:14,"There's this blog, the blog of St. Chrysostom's Church"
00:39:14,00:39:17,"in Manchester, and it's really good."
00:39:17,00:39:18,Do you know when people put proper effort
00:39:18,00:39:20,into quite an obscure thing?
00:39:20,00:39:22,And there's a piece on funny names of church leaders
00:39:22,00:39:25,"throughout history, and there are some such good ones."
00:39:25,00:39:29,"So I like this anecdote, which is Henry Joy Fiennes-Clinton,"
00:39:29,00:39:31,"who was a rector in the early 20th century,"
00:39:31,00:39:33,who went to see the Bishop of London
00:39:33,00:39:35,"and the bishop said, ""Take a chair, Clinton,"""
00:39:35,00:39:38,"to which he replied, ""It's Fiennes-Clinton."""
00:39:38,00:39:41,"And the bishop said, ""In that case, take two."""
00:39:41,00:39:44,"And so it's just, I think, a little funny from a bishop."
00:39:44,00:39:45,(laughing)
00:39:45,00:39:48,"- Come on, it's over! - It's Bishop Humor."
00:39:48,00:39:50,"It's Bishop Humor, yeah."
00:39:50,00:39:51,"- Okay, we won't get him on the podcast."
00:39:51,00:39:54,"It's just, this is his audition tape, and I thought..."
00:39:54,00:39:55,"- Oh, no, come on, give us more zingers."
00:39:55,00:39:57,"- Right, wow. (laughing)"
00:39:57,00:40:00,"- Okay, okay, what about this?"
00:40:00,00:40:04,"The very Reverend Gonville-Obey French Baytag,"
00:40:04,00:40:08,but French is spelled with a small F and two of them.
00:40:08,00:40:09,(laughing)
00:40:09,00:40:10,- What's going on?
00:40:10,00:40:12,- Is that important for the anecdote?
00:40:12,00:40:14,"- There's no anecdote. - That's it, that's it."
00:40:14,00:40:16,- That's it? - That's just the thing.
00:40:16,00:40:19,- It's just the word French spelled slightly differently.
00:40:19,00:40:20,"No, Anna, we want you to tell us"
00:40:20,00:40:22,every single one you've found.
00:40:22,00:40:23,(laughing)
00:40:23,00:40:25,- This is literally all I've got now.
00:40:25,00:40:28,This is not very amusing names.
00:40:28,00:40:31,"Okay, Father John, Brabazan, Brabazan, Loutha?"
00:40:31,00:40:32,Come on!
00:40:32,00:40:33,- It's two Brabazans.
00:40:33,00:40:35,"- Brabazan, Brabazan?"
00:40:35,00:40:38,"- Oh my God, I'm just picturing Jimmy Carr"
00:40:38,00:40:40,at the Hammersmith Apollo.
00:40:40,00:40:43,Your next act is a fucking killer act.
00:40:43,00:40:44,She's got some amazing anecdotes.
00:40:44,00:40:46,"Anna Tashinsky, everybody."
00:40:46,00:40:47,(laughing)
00:40:47,00:40:50,(humming)
00:40:50,00:40:50,- Woo!
00:40:50,00:40:52,We've got Father Page Turner.
00:40:52,00:40:54,We've got Father Pickles.
00:40:54,00:40:57,"- Page Turner, open with Page Turner."
00:40:57,00:40:58,(laughing)
00:40:58,00:40:59,That's great.
00:40:59,00:41:00,Father Pickles is funny as well.
00:41:00,00:41:01,- I'll reorder the set.
00:41:01,00:41:03,"Father Careful, Father Christmas."
00:41:03,00:41:05,- Okay! - Let's go.
00:41:05,00:41:07,"- So that's the one I should stick with,"
00:41:07,00:41:08,Father Christmas.
00:41:08,00:41:11,"- I don't think stick with any of it, but, you know,"
00:41:11,00:41:13,have you guys heard of St. Andrew Undershaft?
00:41:13,00:41:15,(laughing)
00:41:15,00:41:18,"- I can't believe, you just said a name way funnier"
00:41:18,00:41:20,than Anna's 20 days.
00:41:20,00:41:21,(laughing)
00:41:21,00:41:23,- Upstage the full day of work.
00:41:23,00:41:24,- I'm so sorry.
00:41:24,00:41:26,- I've been delving into church.
00:41:26,00:41:28,"- I'm so sorry, this is right under your nose"
00:41:28,00:41:30,the whole time.
00:41:30,00:41:32,"St. Andrew Undershaft is a church in London,"
00:41:32,00:41:34,and it was literally under a massive shaft.
00:41:34,00:41:36,That's the reason it was named like that.
00:41:36,00:41:39,"- It was a massive maypole, a huge maypole."
00:41:39,00:41:42,"I was, this is the 16th century, gigantic maypole."
00:41:42,00:41:44,Can't stress how big this maypole was.
00:41:44,00:41:47,And it was there every year around May Day
00:41:47,00:41:52,until an event in 1517 called the Evil May Day Riots.
00:41:52,00:41:53,- Ooh.
00:41:53,00:41:54,- Which I had never heard of before.
00:41:54,00:41:56,And they were these huge riots.
00:41:56,00:41:58,"They were huge anti-foreigner riots,"
00:41:58,00:41:59,so they weren't very funny.
00:41:59,00:42:02,"But the may, so the maypole was--"
00:42:02,00:42:02,- I'll put them in my set.
00:42:02,00:42:04,(laughing)
00:42:04,00:42:05,- The maypole was toppled.
00:42:05,00:42:07,The maypole had to fall.
00:42:07,00:42:09,And it was then preserved in a house
00:42:09,00:42:11,on nearby Shaft Alley.
00:42:11,00:42:15,But the maypole itself was then destroyed in 1549
00:42:15,00:42:17,as a pagan idol.
00:42:17,00:42:18,"So, yeah."
00:42:18,00:42:20,"But the church St. Andrew Undershaft,"
00:42:20,00:42:22,"500 years later nearly, still has its name."
00:42:22,00:42:24,"- Yeah, cool. - Nice."
00:42:24,00:42:26,"- I'm so sorry that I need to do this,"
00:42:26,00:42:28,but it's bugging me.
00:42:28,00:42:31,So why was the double F thing funny?
00:42:31,00:42:33,(laughing)
00:42:33,00:42:35,"- Tell us the name again, Anna."
00:42:35,00:42:36,- Right.
00:42:36,00:42:41,"The very reverend Gonville-Obey French Baytag,"
00:42:41,00:42:45,but French is spelled with a small F.
00:42:45,00:42:46,- Yeah.
00:42:46,00:42:47,- And two of them.
00:42:47,00:42:48,(laughing)
00:42:48,00:42:50,- I'm now finding it funny.
00:42:50,00:42:53,I think I've gone through the unfunniness.
00:42:53,00:42:53,(laughing)
00:42:53,00:42:55,I'm finding it funny again.
00:42:55,00:42:58,- I find it so funny that there's two Fs in the word funny.
00:42:58,00:42:59,(laughing)
00:42:59,00:43:00,And they're both lowercase.
00:43:00,00:43:02,(laughing)
00:43:02,00:43:05,"- I got told the thing by a very good friend of ours,"
00:43:05,00:43:08,"Jason Haisley, who is a friend of the podcast."
00:43:08,00:43:09,He's been on it a couple of times.
00:43:09,00:43:13,"And we mentioned a fact quite a long time ago,"
00:43:13,00:43:15,"which is, and it was about 50-odd episodes ago,"
00:43:15,00:43:18,which is that flying saucer suites
00:43:18,00:43:21,"are made by this Belgium company, Belgica."
00:43:21,00:43:23,And they are the same people
00:43:23,00:43:24,who make the communion wafers.
00:43:24,00:43:26,"And when Christianity was declining a bit,"
00:43:26,00:43:28,it meant that they had a lot of spare wafers.
00:43:28,00:43:30,And so it's the flying saucers
00:43:30,00:43:32,"that are made out of Jesus,"
00:43:32,00:43:34,of Jesus's body is the flying.
00:43:34,00:43:37,"- Oh, Christianity, I thought you said Christianity."
00:43:37,00:43:39,I thought you were trying for another funny name.
00:43:39,00:43:40,(laughing)
00:43:40,00:43:43,"- Anna, please, no, please not Reverend Christianity."
00:43:43,00:43:46,(laughing)
00:43:46,00:43:48,Too boring.
00:43:48,00:43:51,"- If it was Christianity, that would be pretty good."
00:43:51,00:43:53,(laughing)
00:43:53,00:43:55,- I just misheard again.
00:43:55,00:43:56,"I thought, I don't want to raise it"
00:43:56,00:43:58,because he's a really famous guy.
00:43:58,00:44:00,And I know no one else has heard of it.
00:44:00,00:44:02,"Sorry, Christianity was declining."
00:44:02,00:44:03,"- Yeah, so flying saucer suites"
00:44:03,00:44:06,"are basically communion wafers, that's the thing."
00:44:06,00:44:09,"So Jason was listening to our podcast,"
00:44:09,00:44:10,absolutely blown away by it.
00:44:10,00:44:13,And he messaged his friend who was a vicar
00:44:13,00:44:14,and he told her this story
00:44:14,00:44:16,and he said it blew her mind as well.
00:44:16,00:44:19,"And then he said, she went, oh my God, hang on."
00:44:19,00:44:21,She said that when she was in training as a vicar
00:44:21,00:44:25,"because communion wafers, or hosts as they're properly known,"
00:44:25,00:44:27,"are the literal body of Christ,"
00:44:27,00:44:30,"trainees don't use genuine communion wafers,"
00:44:30,00:44:32,they use flying saucers.
00:44:32,00:44:36,"And so by accident, they're accidentally using this."
00:44:36,00:44:37,"And I know James, I think you said"
00:44:37,00:44:38,that this doesn't feel right.
00:44:38,00:44:41,So I think it's like particular to her story.
00:44:41,00:44:43,"- Yeah, I mean, well, like we always do"
00:44:43,00:44:45,"when people send us stuff like this,"
00:44:45,00:44:47,we go into a massive amount of detail
00:44:47,00:44:49,and I emailed all the reverends and vickers
00:44:49,00:44:50,and priests that I knew.
00:44:50,00:44:53,"And they reckon that until transubstantiation for them,"
00:44:53,00:44:55,"it isn't the body of Christ, so they wouldn't do that."
00:44:55,00:44:57,But that's not to say this person didn't.
00:44:57,00:44:58,"- Yeah, yeah, exactly."
00:44:58,00:45:00,"Can you do it, 'cause they're flying saucers,"
00:45:00,00:45:01,can you do it from a distance?
00:45:01,00:45:03,(laughing)
00:45:03,00:45:04,- 'Cause I think I would start going to church
00:45:04,00:45:06,if someone threw a flying saucer into my mouth.
00:45:06,00:45:07,- That's true.
00:45:07,00:45:09,- And then you'd just be jumping up like a dog
00:45:09,00:45:09,to try and catch it.
00:45:09,00:45:10,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:45:10,00:45:11,- That'd be cool.
00:45:11,00:45:13,"- If you did it like how they do in the bouquet at a wedding,"
00:45:13,00:45:15,who's gonna get body of Christ this week?
00:45:15,00:45:17,(laughing)
00:45:17,00:45:18,Who's going to heaven?
00:45:18,00:45:19,- It's one of you.
00:45:19,00:45:21,(laughing)
00:45:21,00:45:23,"We're gonna have to wrap up in a sec, guys."
00:45:23,00:45:25,"- Oh, is there no time for us and more names?"
00:45:25,00:45:27,"- Oh, okay, I'm so glad you've asked."
00:45:27,00:45:28,Ryan McGvicker?
00:45:28,00:45:30,- I can't believe you've got more.
00:45:30,00:45:31,(laughing)
00:45:31,00:45:33,- Ryan McGvicker is great.
00:45:33,00:45:34,(laughing)
00:45:34,00:45:35,"- Yeah, that is good."
00:45:35,00:45:38,"- My god, are you pissing around with the French guy?"
00:45:38,00:45:41,When you had Ryan McGvicker tucked all the way up your sleeve?
00:45:41,00:45:45,- I still think F-F-F-F-F-F-F-French is the best.
00:45:45,00:45:46,"- Maybe, maybe."
00:45:46,00:45:48,"- Can I just, on churches reinventing themselves,"
00:45:48,00:45:50,there is a church that's shaped like a high-heeled shoe
00:45:50,00:45:53,"in Taiwan, which has the Guinness record"
00:45:53,00:45:55,for the largest high-heeled shoe shape structure.
00:45:55,00:45:57,And it was built in 2016.
00:45:57,00:45:59,"It's actually a wedding venue,"
00:45:59,00:46:00,so it's not ordained by God.
00:46:00,00:46:02,It's like a wedding church.
00:46:02,00:46:04,But it was built to attract women.
00:46:04,00:46:07,And the Taiwanese government said
00:46:07,00:46:10,"there will be a hundred female-oriented features inside,"
00:46:10,00:46:14,"like maple leaves, chairs for lovers,"
00:46:14,00:46:16,with biscuits and cakes.
00:46:16,00:46:17,- Women.
00:46:17,00:46:19,(laughing)
00:46:19,00:46:20,"- That's, and it's so weird."
00:46:20,00:46:23,It's inspired by the story of a girl in the 1960s
00:46:23,00:46:24,"who got Blackfoot disease,"
00:46:24,00:46:26,"had both of her legs amputated,"
00:46:26,00:46:28,and her groom canceled her wedding.
00:46:28,00:46:30,"So it's in honor of her, which I actually think"
00:46:30,00:46:31,is quite offensive.
00:46:31,00:46:33,- They made the church shape like a shoe.

00:46:45,00:46:48,the house is full of maple leaves and it's a nightmare.
00:46:48,00:46:50,"- Well, you mean the ice hockey team."

00:46:58,00:47:00,"- In 2019, have you guys heard of the company"
00:47:00,00:47:02,called the Christian Book Depository?

00:47:03,00:47:04,"- Yes, I think so."
00:47:04,00:47:07,"- Yeah, so the Christian Book Depository,"
00:47:07,00:47:08,they complained in 2019
00:47:08,00:47:11,'cause they kept getting phone calls like this.
00:47:11,00:47:12,"A person would call up and say,"
00:47:12,00:47:14,"""Hey, I'm looking for my order."""
00:47:14,00:47:15,"And they're like, ""What did you order?"""
00:47:15,00:47:18,"He says, ""I ordered gummies."""
00:47:18,00:47:20,"And they went, ""Ah, right, you're not in the right place."""
00:47:20,00:47:24,"And it turns out that their website, cbd.com,"
00:47:24,00:47:26,who is attracting the wrong kind of people.
00:47:26,00:47:29,(laughing)
00:47:29,00:47:32,So they've changed their name to Christian Book.
00:47:32,00:47:33,- That's great.
00:47:33,00:47:34,"- Christian Book, that'll be a great name for a vicar."
