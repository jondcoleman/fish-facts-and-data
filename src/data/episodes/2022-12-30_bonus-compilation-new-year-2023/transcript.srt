00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,960
 Ho ho ho!

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,520
 Hello, Clubfishers!

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,920
 It's not further Christmas, it's me, it's Andy.

5
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,920
 Uh, hello, just wanted to say

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,240
 hope you had a lovely break,

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,000
 hope you had a very nice Christmas,

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,560
 hope you have a fantastic new year when it comes,

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,720
 hope all sorts of nice things for you,

10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,120
 and most importantly of all, hope you enjoy

11
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,040
 this latest bit of Clubfish.

12
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,120
 This is a new compilation,

13
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,080
 it's all the best bits that didn't make it into our touring shows,

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,880
 we went on tour all over Scotland and Wales in the autumn,

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,360
 and we've been sitting on these bits,

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,320
 that sounds rude,

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,600
 but we've been keeping these bits just for you,

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,000
 if your middle name is Lenezra,

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,600
 if you like Blenny's,

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,680
 if you've ever cycled a thousand miles,

21
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,880
 for not a very good reason,

22
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,880
 if you've got more than one spleen,

23
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,840
 this is for you,

24
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,280
 hope you enjoy it,

25
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,880
 and we'll see you next time.

 [Music]

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,160
 Just a fact that kind of brings together

28
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,040
 a couple of the facts,

29
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,200
 so about cars and about cardboard,

30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,760
 so this is the Solar and Interstellar Rocket Car,

31
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,040
 built by Daniel D. Hungerford in 1929,

32
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,000
 and it was a rocket powered car,

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,200
 which he managed to get licensed in the state of New York,

34
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,480
 and it went 70 miles an hour

35
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,720
 and shot out a 20-foot flame

36
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,160
 from the back of it as it drove,

37
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,840
 and it was made out of cardboard and linoleum.

38
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,880
 Wow.

39
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,600
 Oh dear.

40
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,840
 And why do you think he made his rocket car

41
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,080
 out of cardboard and linoleum?

42
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,640
 Well, lighter?

43
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,840
 Lighter is a good idea,

44
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,960
 but he said,

45
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,920
 "In case of trouble,

46
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,840
 I wanted to be able to kick my way out."

47
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,880
 That's so good.

48
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,960
 That's amazing.

49
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,840
 Yeah?

50
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,800
 It existed.

51
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,360
 Why don't we all have one?

52
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,040
 It got two miles to the gallon.

53
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,960
 That's why we don't all have one.

54
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,720
 So the guy who was the lead developer of Excel itself

55
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,800
 was a guy called Doug Klunder,

56
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,320
 and he sounds like a bit of a character,

57
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,480
 so they were just developing Excel,

58
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,840
 it was all going to be very exciting.

59
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,440
 He was the only one who understood

60
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,880
 lots of the components of it,

61
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,440
 and then suddenly he completely quit.

62
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,480
 There was a little bit of a debate

63
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,320
 over whether they should go with Microsoft or Apple,

64
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,200
 something like that.

65
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,520
 So he quit and went to become a lettuce farmer.

66
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,240
 And he took an ill-fated job in lettuce farming.

67
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:28,960
 Ill-fated?

68
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,000
 I don't know why it was...

69
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,480
 He didn't die.

70
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,520
 Come on, but we need details, yeah.

71
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,640
 He didn't drown in lettuce

72
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,240
 because he came back in the end.

73
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,520
 But before he left,

74
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,240
 he just left them a three-day-long video lecture

75
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,920
 in how to work Excel.

76
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,960
 Imagine every time you have to work Excel.

77
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,760
 Three days long?

78
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,160
 You cannot get to watch this whole video.

79
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,040
 Oh, my God.

80
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,800
 Klunder.

81
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,560
 Three days?

82
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,000
 I was looking at some other experts in this kind of field.

83
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,040
 So the best speed typer.

84
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,160
 Okay, how many words a minute do you reckon you can do?

85
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,040
 Well, a decent standard is kind of 60 or 70.

86
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,440
 Yeah, mine's about 60, I would say, and I'm okay.

87
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,000
 Do you get to pick the words?

88
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,880
 You do not.

89
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,240
 No, they randomly come up.

90
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,600
 Oh, okay.

91
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,080
 You can't just write "I" a hundred times in a minute.

92
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,160
 I'll say 110, someone really good.

93
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,040
 Well, there was recently a competition,

94
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,240
 and the winner was someone called Anthony "Chack" Ermillin,

95
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,000
 and they got 210 words per minute.

96
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,960
 What?

97
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,560
 But that's not even the record.

98
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,760
 The record is 216 words per minute,

99
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,920
 and that was done in 1946 by a woman called Stella Perjunis.

100
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,600
 Wow.

101
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:45,440
 And she's in tonight, clapping herself on an egotistical twat.

102
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,680
 But she actually became quite famous in the late 40s

103
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,080
 for having been such an amazing typer,

104
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,760
 and she got a job at IBM,

105
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,520
 and they had a new electric typewriter,

106
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,640
 and she was like the face,

107
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,840
 or rather the fingers of the electric typewriter.

108
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,600
 That's a great use, darling.

109
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,120
 They're making me the face?

110
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,360
 No.

111
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,680
 This is about parts of names.

112
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,200
 I've just looked into middle names a bit.

113
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,080
 Okay, yeah.

114
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,320
 So there is a trend of people,

115
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,360
 almost all fathers,

116
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,800
 claiming that they have given their daughter

117
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,120
 the beautiful middle name, Lanesra.

118
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,320
 Have you heard of this?

119
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,200
 No. Lanesra.

120
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,160
 And it's a lovely middle name,

121
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,080
 but the reason that people, like dads,

122
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:22,960
 are claiming they've managed

123
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,240
 to get it into their daughter's name

124
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,920
 is because it's arsenal backwards.

125
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,360
 Oh, it's not a thing.

126
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,080
 That's great.

127
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,720
 Yeah.

128
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,240
 So have people actually caught that name?

129
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:32,960
 You said there's a...

130
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,840
 We don't know,

131
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,680
 because it's never happened three times in a year,

132
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,360
 because that's when it shows up on official stats.

133
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:37,760
 I see.

134
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,920
 So if you're out there and you're called Lanesra,

135
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,880
 please get in touch with us.

136
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,280
 You'll probably be under five years old, so...

137
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,800
 (laughter)

138
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,680
 Yeah.

139
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,880
 But people changing middle names.

140
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,760
 That's a big thing.

141
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,560
 And deep poll stations always get inundated

142
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,080
 with people who want to do specifically

143
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,720
 for middle names.

144
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,480
 And I was looking at the deep poll website,

145
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,240
 which is deeppoll.org.uk.

146
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,440
 And it was saying,

147
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,800
 it's got a lot of lists about

148
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,080
 how you change your name,

149
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,800
 how you do this stuff.

150
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,800
 And then it just only says deep poll trivia.

151
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,240
 And it's...

152
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,560
 There's only one fact in there,

153
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,560
 in their big list,

154
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,480
 which is one of the most popular

155
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,320
 middle names added is danger.

156
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,520
 Inspiration of which comes from Austin Powers.

157
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,920
 So it says, yeah,

158
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,160
 every week we issue at least one deep poll

159
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,160
 to someone who comes in to say,

160
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,680
 "Danger is my middle name."

161
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,680
 Apparently, according to the once a week that happens.

162
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,200
 That's a good fact.

163
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,040
 From deep poll, like whoever's researching,

164
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,480
 they're lazy,

165
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,920
 but at least when they do the work,

166
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,840
 they come up with the goods.

167
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,680
 Well, what happens if one week someone doesn't?

168
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,600
 Do they have to remove their only bit of trivia?

169
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,400
 Yeah, how rigorous are they?

170
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,920
 The last thing is, there's a quiz from me,

171
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,480
 and then, sorry.

172
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,160
 You got a quiz.

173
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,560
 Macaulay Culkin changed his middle name.

174
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,760
 Okay.

175
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,240
 Yeah.

176
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,640
 So what do you think he changed his middle name to?

177
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,120
 I think it was Carson to begin with.

178
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,680
 Carson?

179
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,400
 Yeah.

180
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,040
 Okay.

181
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,040
 Is it something to do with Home Alone?

182
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,520
 No.

183
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,560
 That's not Kevin.

184
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,280
 No, it's not Kevin.

185
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:01,520
 Okay.

186
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:01,840
 No.

187
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,120
 You're not going to guess it.

188
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,000
 We're not going to guess it.

189
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,360
 People need to go home one day.

190
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,200
 So this is...

191
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,400
 He says this has been done.

192
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,280
 Macaulay Culkin's middle name

193
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,360
 is now Macaulay Culkin.

194
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,040
 So he is now Macaulay Culkin Culkin.

195
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,080
 That's his name.

196
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,400
 So great.

197
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,160
 Good on him.

198
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,480
 He did it as an internet vote.

199
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,000
 He put up a bunch of names that he got.

200
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,680
 He did like a Bodebuck boat face.

201
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,160
 The other options were Shark Week.

202
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,880
 The McRibbers back.

203
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,280
 Yeah, and Macaulay Culkin.

204
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,960
 And that was so good.

205
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,720
 You can eat zebraspiders as well.

206
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,640
 Well, as in humans can.

207
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,440
 Humans can.

208
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,400
 But more Thai zebraspiders,

209
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,080
 which are a lot bigger than these.

210
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,120
 Right.

211
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,240
 So if you go to Thailand,

212
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,680
 you might see them in street markets.

213
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,360
 You can buy these Thai zebraspiders.

214
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,920
 And if you buy a steak

215
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,000
 and you want to know how well done it is,

216
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,080
 you know, there's a trick

217
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,240
 where you can touch your finger with your thumb

218
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,920
 and then which finger you touch tells you

219
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,800
 whether it's well done, medium rare, rare, and whatever.

220
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,120
 Well, there's a trick with Thai zebraspiders

221
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,240
 and you cook them

222
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,400
 and it's how much the legs are curled up

223
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,720
 indicates how well cooked it is.

224
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,040
 So if you like it well done,

225
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,120
 then you have the legs really curled up.

226
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,520
 And if you like it a bit more rare than the legs.

227
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,960
 I think I'll just have the salad.

228
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,280
 You want to go on more?

229
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,000
 Okay, now I'm going for the Costa Rican Zebra Tarantula.

230
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,520
 I just think we should mention him

231
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,720
 because I find it weird

232
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,240
 that quite a lot of things are named after zebras.

233
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,200
 By the way, I don't think we've said

234
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,720
 that the reason we're calling it a zebra spider

235
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,840
 is because it's stripy,

236
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,520
 which maybe you figured out,

237
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,200
 but it's worth saying.

238
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,720
 But zebra tarantulas are so cool.

239
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,240
 We just found out recently that

240
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,240
 while all spiders have a spinnerette,

241
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,000
 like they're basically their spinning wheel

242
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,680
 on their backs or on their abdomen,

243
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,880
 these zebra tarantulas have little spinning wheels

244
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,800
 on the ends of all of their feet.

245
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,920
 And they have multiple ones.

246
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,440
 So on the end of every foot,

247
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,920
 they have loads of other tiny feet

248
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,320
 and each tiny foot on the end of each foot

249
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,560
 can shoot out little bits of silk.

250
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,840
 And this means that if you've got

251
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,800
 the most flawlessly smooth window you can imagine

252
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,400
 and you get a zebra tarantula,

253
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,000
 it can just climb up it willy-nilly

254
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 because it shoots these little bits of silk

255
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,360
 out of its every tiny foot.

256
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:21,920
 Wow.

257
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,320
 Yeah.

258
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,480
 God, Spider-Man wasn't bitten by that spider

259
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,080
 and just grew all these tiny hands on his fingers.

260
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,280
 No, that'd be a cool movie, actually.

261
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,080
 It would, yeah.

262
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,360
 It'd be more attractive, Ridley.

263
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,160
 Yeah. Okay, I need to move us on to...

264
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,120
 Just me? Okay.

265
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,440
 Okay.

266
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,720
 Another cat woman, a cat person,

267
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,880
 is someone called Kate Bird Soul Johnson

268
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,280
 who, according to Sotheby's,

269
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,400
 was possibly America's greatest cat enthusiast.

270
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:55,280
 She owned 350 Persian and Angora cats.

271
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,640
 They all had a group of servants who would lack after them.

272
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,000
 She was a multi-multi-millionaire.

273
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,120
 She also owned a load of parrots and cockatoos

274
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,400
 but she only owed them so that they would entertain the cats.

275
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:12,240
 And she commissioned the world's largest ever cat painting,

276
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,360
 which was six feet by 8.5 feet.

277
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,240
 It was so heavy that when she put it on the wall,

278
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,760
 they had to reinforce the wall

279
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,200
 so that it wouldn't bring the wall down.

280
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,160
 Wait, what was it painted on?

281
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,240
 It must have been something very heavy.

282
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,800
 Yeah, it must have been a painting on lead panels or something.

283
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,120
 So it was plywood, so I don't know.

284
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,680
 I think she needs to contact a structural engineer about this.

285
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,200
 All of her.

286
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,520
 Perhaps the cats are peeing on the wall a lot, I don't know.

287
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:42,800
 But anyway, it sold recently for $826,000 this cat painting.

288
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,760
 Wow.

289
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,480
 She commissioned a guy called Carl Kaler

290
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,440
 to paint these cats,

291
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,280
 paid him an absolute fortune to do it.

292
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:53,440
 And he spent three years studying cat poses

293
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,960
 before he painted this painting.

294
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,840
 Well, can I ask, the picture, have you seen?

295
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,680
 Does it contain all 300?

296
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,000
 No, it contains about 40 of the cats.

297
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,760
 Like one of them in particular in the middle

298
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,960
 is really sort of proud,

299
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,400
 and then the other ones are like around.

300
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,040
 Right.

301
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,840
 Oh, amazing.

302
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,880
 It feels beatable.

303
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,240
 Six feet by eight.

304
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:10,800
 Go for it.

305
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:17,760
 Mudskippers are another cool fish that get very aggressive.

306
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,040
 The males get very territorial and aggressive with each other.

307
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,280
 And one of the cool things about mudskippers

308
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,120
 is they live almost entirely on land.

309
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,200
 So they're one of these incredible fish

310
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,400
 that just like slide around the rocks using their fins,

311
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,840
 propelling themselves along.

312
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,640
 They can actually, using the pectoral fins on their chest,

313
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,080
 they can propel themselves,

314
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,240
 I think, 50 centimeters in the air,

315
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,200
 just in one jump.

316
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:39,840
 Wow, wow.

317
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,040
 They can simply leap.

318
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,040
 And it's amazing watching them fight.

319
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,600
 So if one encroaches on another's territory,

320
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,360
 they just, it's like a martial arts film.

321
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,040
 They just like flip upside down.

322
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,000
 They jab each other.

323
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,200
 They karate chop each other.

324
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,920
 And then there's one video where one of them

325
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,520
 looks like he's being defeated.

326
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,680
 And then he just gets his big mouth

327
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,680
 and sucks onto the other one

328
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,440
 and picks him up with his mouth

329
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,520
 and then just starts, you know,

330
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,280
 judging him around with his face

331
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,200
 and then tosses him away.

332
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,480
 It's an incredible move.

333
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,600
 And this is all on land.

334
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,600
 Yeah, yeah, it's all on rocks.

335
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,560
 Yeah, yeah.

336
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,120
 Early.

337
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,840
 It's pretty cool.

338
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,520
 It's like WWF for fish world.

339
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,520
 Wait, so he, it's the same,

340
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,200
 sorry, were they the same species or were they the same?

341
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,960
 Yeah, same species, two males.

342
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,400
 So one's got a finishing move

343
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,720
 where they just latch their lips on.

344
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,520
 Yeah.

345
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,680
 Like a good suction plumbing thing.

346
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,040
 Exactly.

347
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,120
 Okay, that's, yeah, that's a powerful end move.

348
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,160
 You'd watch that, wouldn't you?

349
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,760
 If that was a move in wrestling.

350
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,440
 I'd watch everything we've said here.

351
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,200
 Okay, I'm going to give you one last thing

352
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,720
 and see if you've, you'd watch this.

353
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,040
 Yeah.

354
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,600
 Okay.

355
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,360
 This is, have you heard of mouth brooders?

356
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,880
 Mouth brooders?

357
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,240
 Are these the frogs?

358
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,200
 Keep asking them out.

359
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,480
 Yeah, it's, it's like, it's a family.

360
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,760
 It's a load of different species.

361
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,800
 Some are frogs, some are fish.

362
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,560
 They keep the eggs in their mouth until they hatch.

363
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,960
 The fertilized ones, I should say.

364
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,520
 But there is a fish, which I've never heard of before.

365
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:08,160
 It's synodontis multipunctatus,

366
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,680
 and it's called the cuckoo catfish.

367
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,240
 And what it does is it, it cuckoos.

368
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:14,800
 Wow.

369
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,120
 Another fish called the thick lipped.

370
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,080
 Is it situlid?

371
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,880
 Is that how we say it?

372
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,160
 Chick lid, I think.

373
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,280
 Chick lid, okay, chick lid.

374
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,080
 It cuckoos another fish called the thick lipped chick lid,

375
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,720
 right?

376
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,520
 So that fish is a mouth brooder, okay?

377
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,920
 And what the catfish does is,

378
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,760
 as the female victim is laying her eggs,

379
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,600
 the catfish will sneak under

380
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,080
 and lay her own eggs right nearby.

381
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,200
 And then the chick lid just scoops both up

382
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,960
 and keeps them in her mouth until they hatch.

383
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,760
 But the cuckoo catfish eggs hatch first,

384
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,400
 and then they eat the other eggs in her mouth,

385
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,000
 in the mother's mouth,

386
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,440
 and then they just escape out of the mouth

387
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,160
 and off they go.

388
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,520
 That's incredible.

389
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,600
 That is, it's also, it's a catfish,

390
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,640
 so she has literally been catfished the mouth brooder.

391
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,200
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

392
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,960
 Wow.

393
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,520
 Yeah.

394
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,800
 Yeah, that's so funny.

395
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,480
 I thought you were going to say that it's a child

396
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,160
 that gets born inside the mouth,

397
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,240
 and just occasionally when it opens its mouth,

398
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,320
 the child goes just comes out, and they're back in.

399
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,200
 Like the cuckoo club fish.

400
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,800
 Like the cuckoo club, yeah.

401
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,440
 Wow.

402
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,640
 But that's as cool.

403
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,320
 I'd watch both that, but more mine.

404
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,560
 Have you guys heard of the barred chin blenny?

405
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:30,880
 No.

406
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,760
 This is really good.

407
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,160
 Okay, so the female lays the eggs,

408
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,560
 and then the male is often left in charge

409
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,160
 until the eggs hatch, okay?

410
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,720
 So that's relatively unusual in the animal kingdom.

411
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,080
 You know, the males don't,

412
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,520
 or frequently just go off right here.

413
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,560
 These ones do though, right?

414
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,560
 These ones look after the eggs, I believe.

415
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,000
 Yeah, blenny's do generally.

416
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,880
 Oh, Jane, sorry.

417
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,440
 In the case of the barred chin blenny,

418
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,600
 this usually works really well this system,

419
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,520
 except if the female leaves under a certain number of eggs,

420
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,080
 if she has left fewer than a thousand eggs,

421
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:04,320
 the male will tend to just eat all the eggs himself.

422
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,520
 What?

423
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,800
 Because he can't be bothered to look after them,

424
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,800
 and he wants to breed again as soon as possible.

425
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,840
 So...

426
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,840
 That's amazing, but what that says to me

427
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,720
 is that he can kind of tell the difference between a thousand,

428
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,320
 not a thousand and a thousand and one,

429
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,680
 but like between...

430
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,520
 Yeah, between a thousand and two thousand though,

431
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,560
 I'm sure it can, yeah.

432
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,920
 No, it's impressive, you're right.

433
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,440
 And it is the male's way of saying,

434
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,880
 like middle finger up at that woman

435
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,480
 who's only brought him a thousand eggs, isn't it?

436
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,000
 It's him saying, "All right, I'm not going to bother.

437
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,240
 If you're giving me this shit, I'm just going to eat it.

438
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,800
 I want five grand or your best offer."

439
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,640
 That's basically why they do it.

440
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,840
 And there are some female blenny's who try to get around this

441
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,120
 and start out who's going to eat their eggs

442
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,960
 by bringing the male a sample sort of fake egg collection first.

443
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,280
 So they'll generate a few eggs,

444
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,160
 drop it off with the male,

445
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,320
 be like, "Could you just look after these for a few days?

446
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,000
 Go away, come back."

447
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,600
 If the male's eating them,

448
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,840
 they'll be like, "Cool, not the dad for me."

449
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,160
 And then find another one.

450
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,280
 That's a trick.

451
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:01,520
 Yeah.

452
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:06,400
 Years ago, when I lived in a flat that was always renting,

453
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,480
 there was a cat flap in the door.

454
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,680
 And so this cat that lived in the premises used to come in

455
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,040
 and it really liked me.

456
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,320
 It always used to come every night.

457
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,640
 And I think it liked me because I never let it...

458
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,520
 I never touched it, but I always let it touch me.

459
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,240
 So I used to...

460
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,440
 Again, that HR meeting.

461
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,560
 I think we do need to have it again.

462
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:24,720
 Yeah.

463
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,440
 So I used to be just sitting on a sofa

464
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,000
 and it would come and jump on my stomach

465
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,160
 and it would sort of knead my stomach.

466
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,520
 And I think it did something.

467
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,560
 I don't know for its hands somehow, hands.

468
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:36,960
 Knuckles?

469
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,560
 Pause?

470
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:38,960
 Yeah.

471
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,680
 Yeah, for its...

472
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,560
 I don't know what it did,

473
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,880
 but it would come and it would knead me for about 20 minutes.

474
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,400
 It sometimes looked like it was doing a job,

475
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,080
 like, "Oh, Jesus Christ, I need to knead this guy."

476
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,920
 And then it would leave and then it would come back every day,

477
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,240
 roughly the same time, just to give me a good old kneading.

478
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:52,800
 Wow.

479
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,040
 Yeah.

480
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,920
 But it liked me, I would say.

481
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,240
 Yeah.

482
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,480
 The interesting thing, though, actually with the Dutch clogs

483
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,680
 is we're not quite sure when they first came in

484
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,680
 because whenever you would have clogs,

485
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,000
 when they wore out, what would you do with them?

486
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,680
 You wouldn't keep them, of course.

487
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,320
 Your house is fuelled by fire.

488
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,920
 You would just throw the clogs on the fire.

489
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,240
 Oh, okay, yeah.

490
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,480
 And so we really don't have that many old versions of it

491
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,920
 from old, like, Netherlands.

492
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,800
 Yeah, yeah.

493
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,600
 James, you've been to a lot of museums in your life, right?

494
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:21,840
 I certainly have.

495
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,800
 You're constantly going,

496
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,720
 "Have you yet visited, in the Netherlands,

497
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,880
 the International Wooden Shoe Museum?"

498
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,720
 I'm afraid not, no.

499
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,200
 You've not?

500
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:29,680
 No.

501
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,400
 Where is it?

502
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:34,080
 It's in Ilde, L-D-E.

503
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,640
 Okay.

504
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,800
 They have 2,200 different wooden shoes and footwear

505
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,560
 from 43 different countries.

506
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,880
 And that's the most interesting thing

507
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,920
 I could find out about it.

508
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,960
 I can see why you thought I might have gone there.

509
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,760
 Well, because we know that once you go to these places,

510
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,040
 they're actually really exciting.

511
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,920
 But I've got to say, on paper, I've done this dish for you.

512
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,360
 Dan, actually, I looked up the same

513
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,760
 International Wooden Shoe Museum.

514
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,000
 Yeah.

515
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,920
 I think it might be called Ilde.

516
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,400
 Ilde.

517
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,720
 And I couldn't find out anything either.

518
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,760
 If you search for funny, you would get the humor article.

519
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,120
 That's a redirect, right?

520
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:09,200
 Yeah.

521
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,560
 So you can type in one thing

522
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,120
 and it'll take you to what Wikipedia thinks you mean.

523
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,320
 Some of these have existed and then been removed.

524
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,120
 So, for instance, if you search for Emperor of Wikipedia,

525
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,400
 you would get--

526
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,320
 Jimmy Wells.

527
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,600
 Jimmy Wells, exactly.

528
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,680
 If you search for King who died with a hot poker up at the ass--

529
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,280
 Over the second?

530
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,040
 Over the second, yeah.

531
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,120
 But now if you type that in, it won't know what you mean.

532
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,240
 Oh, right.

533
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:34,560
 Yeah.

534
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:39,360
 And if you search for 22.86 centimeter nails--

535
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,640
 Nine-inch nails?

536
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,360
 Nine-inch nails.

537
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,080
 Nine-inch nails.

538
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:42,720
 Very nice.

539
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,560
 Who the fuck is going, "What's the name of that panda game?"

540
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,960
 Is it 20--

541
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,200
 That's amazing.

542
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,320
 That's a great quiz, by the way.

543
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,760
 Redirect, where it's just, yeah.

544
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,560
 That's a really good quiz.

545
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,160
 Do you want another quiz, quickly?

546
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,440
 Yeah, let's do it.

547
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,320
 If you search for sex symbol on Wikipedia,

548
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,160
 whose photograph do you see?

549
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,040
 Andrew Murray.

550
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,320
 Obviously, you're not.

551
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,400
 Someone extremely sexy.

552
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:10,960
 Andrew Ma.

553
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,080
 Andrew Ma.

554
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,160
 Is that just a personal--

555
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,920
 Anyone in the audience?

556
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,160
 OK.

557
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,640
 I think we've got it over there.

558
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,600
 Marilyn Monroe.

559
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,000
 Marilyn Monroe.

560
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,480
 That's correct.

561
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,160
 Comedian.

562
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,120
 Jerry Seinfelds.

563
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:27,760
 Nope.

564
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,360
 It's actually two comedians.

565
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,160
 Malcolm and Wise.

566
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:30,880
 Hale and Pace.

567
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,880
 Andrew Ma and Emily Makeless.

568
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,040
 Anton Deck.

569
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,480
 Anton Deck.

570
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,000
 No, it's Laurel and Hardy.

571
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,640
 Ah, yeah.

572
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,000
 And if you search for red hair.

573
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,200
 Ron Weasley.

574
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,360
 Real name.

575
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,160
 Ron Weasley is good.

576
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,200
 Oh, Rupert Grimm.

577
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:49,920
 Well done, Andy.

578
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,000
 Rupert Grimm says the right answer.

579
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,800
 I got it right.

580
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,040
 Well done, Andy.

581
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:55,520
 Thank you.

582
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,000
 Do you know, Richard III helped out with Game of Thrones?

583
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,920
 How did he come out?

584
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,480
 Well, he was.

585
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,120
 So, basically, in a lot of ways, he wasn't a very nice guy.

586
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,440
 History is true there.

587
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,520
 And one of the things he did when he was king

588
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,200
 is he made his--

589
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,640
 he wanted to humiliate this woman called Jane Shaw.

590
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,960
 Now, Jane Shaw had been the previous king,

591
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,200
 his dead brother, Edward's mistress.

592
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,800
 He didn't like her for various reasons.

593
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,880
 So, he thought she was plotting against him

594
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,960
 with his enemies.

595
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,520
 And also, apparently, she was extremely merry,

596
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,200
 very fun, very witty.

597
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,440
 And the speculation that-- because Richard wasn't that.

598
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,480
 He was kind of pissed off that she was.

599
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,240
 Anyway, so he said, "I'm going to humiliate this woman

600
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,040
 "for being so promiscuous and seducing my dead brother."

601
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,400
 And so, he made her walk in just her underwear

602
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,520
 through the streets of London

603
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,120
 carrying this one little candle,

604
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,200
 like, all the way through the streets of London

605
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,720
 to completely humiliate her.

606
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,360
 And this is, you know, a literal walk of shame.

607
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,440
 And that happens in Game of Thrones.

608
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,040
 And George R.R. Martin said he based Cersei Lannister,

609
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,760
 I think, does it?

610
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,160
 Oh, really?

611
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,800
 Yes, he did.

612
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,000
 Yeah, thank you.

613
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,160
 Yes, does a walk of shame in Game of Thrones,

614
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,360
 which is imitating that.

615
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:05,840
 Amazing.

616
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,200
 Have you heard of a cocktail called the Smoker's Cough?

617
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,960
 No.

618
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,360
 No.

619
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:11,840
 No.

620
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,360
 It's Jägermeister and Mayonnaise.

621
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,800
 Lovely.

622
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,320
 Yeah.

623
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,400
 Why, it just looks like Flemish.

624
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,080
 It looks really rough, yeah, yeah.

625
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,520
 It's the only one that's slightly worse than that

626
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,880
 I've heard of is the Cement Mixer.

627
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,760
 Oh, I've had that.

628
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,160
 Yeah, which is Baileys and lime juice.

629
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:28,640
 Yeah, yeah.

630
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,720
 And the lime juice makes the Baileys curdle.

631
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,800
 So, you can chew it and drink it.

632
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,760
 Mostly, you just spit it out.

633
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,480
 Yes.

634
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,000
 I need to wrap us up in a sec, guys.

635
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,840
 Oh, they were also the first company

636
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,000
 to ever advertise a football jersey.

637
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,640
 Oh, yeah?

638
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,440
 Jägermeister.

639
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,920
 They advertised, in Europe, at least,

640
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,520
 it was Eintracht Bronze Spike,

641
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,560
 and they were really allowed to.

642
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,360
 So, what they did was,

643
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,560
 they got rid of Eintracht's actual symbol

644
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,480
 and just put the Jägermeister symbol there

645
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,920
 and said, "Well, that's our symbol now."

646
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,640
 So clever.

647
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,520
 Three years later,

648
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,600
 they had the first ever one in the UK

649
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,280
 and it was Kettering Town.

650
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,280
 And they tried to use the same trick.

651
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,760
 And so, Kettering Town replaced the symbol

652
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,960
 with Kettering Tires.

653
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,680
 And the idea was, they would do that.

654
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,440
 The FA would have none of it.

655
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,880
 And they said, "Right, we're going to,

656
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,480
 you know, we're going to kick you out of the league

657
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,400
 if you don't get rid of the advertising."

658
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,040
 And so, the guy who owned it changed it to,

659
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:27,120
 it just said Kettering Tee on the front of the jersey.

660
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,440
 And he said, "The Tee stands for town."

661
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,560
 But actually, everyone knew

662
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,400
 that it stood for Kettering Tires.

663
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,120
 Clever.

664
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,080
 That is clever.

665
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,280
 I feel really bad for Kettering

666
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,000
 that it actually does got a laugh in and of itself

667
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,240
 when you mentioned the name Kettering.

668
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:40,800
 Come on.

669
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,920
 You know, if you want to get shoes on a cow,

670
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,600
 you have to tip it over.

671
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,200
 No, really?

672
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,000
 Yeah, yeah.

673
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 And this was, they had to do it a lot

674
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,120
 back in the days of droving

675
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,560
 when you had to put shoes on your cows.

676
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,680
 You had to put shoes on your cows?

677
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,280
 Well, if you were droving them to market,

678
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,120
 so, you know, many, many miles,

679
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,080
 then you'd put shoes on the cows to protect their feet.

680
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,000
 Do you mean the metal hoove kind things?

681
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,640
 Or like?

682
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,960
 Yeah, I think, not the steel, not pink stilettos.

683
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,360
 More like horse shoes.

684
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,560
 But because they can't lift one foot at a time,

685
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,440
 you'd have to get an extremely strong couple of men

686
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,920
 or women to push the cow over

687
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,480
 in order to get the shoes on its feet.

688
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,360
 That's, wow.

689
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:17,600
 I know.

690
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,280
 It's a horrible visit to the shoe shop for calves.

691
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,080
 Yeah, that's fair.

692
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,600
 Is it hard to get a cow back up?

693
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,840
 It feels like it's easier to get it down

694
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,440
 than to raise it back up.

695
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,560
 That's why cow tipping is more fun than cow lifting, I guess.

696
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,720
 That's why it's not fun.

697
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,600
 That's why it's not a thing.

698
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,960
 Let's go and look.

699
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,320
 When you were a student, you went around

700
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,680
 just lifting up cows, didn't you, Alex?

701
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,240
 Yeah, yeah, me and 30 buddies

702
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,080
 failing to lift a single calf.

703
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,760
 It's like the end of Glastonbury you come in

704
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,480
 just to clean up every morning.

705
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,880
 So if you had a balloon on the International Space Station

706
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,160
 and you blew it up,

707
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,920
 you wouldn't need helium to keep it upright,

708
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,000
 like it just, because there's no gravity,

709
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,520
 so it just hangs in there.

710
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,400
 So that's pretty exciting that you're saving on helium

711
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,680
 if you're having a party, but...

712
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,200
 That's a good point.

713
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,640
 But you've got to get all your friends up

714
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,760
 to the ISS, though.

715
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,800
 That's going to be costly.

716
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,320
 Yeah, there's a lot of logistical issues.

717
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,360
 Absolutely.

718
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,480
 You're allowed one friend.

719
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,200
 But here's the problem.

720
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,000
 Oh, there isn't another problem with this scheme, is there?

721
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,240
 Well, I would argue this is the main problem, yeah.

722
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,880
 If you were blowing a balloon up on the International Space Station,

723
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,400
 the problem is that once you blow into the balloon,

724
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,000
 so the way that balloons work on Earth

725
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,080
 is that the reason they blow up

726
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,000
 is because you're pushing air into it.

727
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,040
 So you're expanding the rubber itself, the balloon itself, right?

728
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,440
 Because the air, once it stops, it just hangs there.

729
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,040
 But in space, things don't stop.

730
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,400
 You give it propulsion, right?

731
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,000
 So as soon as you blow into a balloon,

732
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,400
 the air you've blown in doesn't stop.

733
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,160
 It just continues to expand the balloon

734
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,600
 because it's pushing outwards

735
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,160
 because it doesn't have anything to stop its motion.

736
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,840
 So as soon as you blow into a balloon,

737
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,200
 it immediately expands to the biggest it can and pops.

738
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,160
 That would be in actual space as opposed to the space station, right?

739
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,000
 That's in actual outer space, or...

740
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,240
 Yeah, we can have the party outside, yeah.

741
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:08,240
 We can't waste the patio that NASA have installed.

742
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,640
 Is that you're talking about the pressure,

743
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,040
 the air pressure outside being so little?

744
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,000
 I guess so, but I don't understand.

745
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,160
 Are you just saying that when you blow,

746
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,080
 when you blow a stream of air from your mouth,

747
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,680
 it just keeps moving in this direction?

748
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,920
 The propulsion of the air that you've gone...

749
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,520
 inside the balloon.

750
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,000
 If you're trying to do one of those long balloons

751
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,760
 to make a sausage dog, that's actually very convenient.

752
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,600
 So in a way, the party is back on.

753
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,920
 But wait, I don't understand,

754
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,520
 because when you exhale on the International Space Station,

755
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,840
 it's not like you can never stop exhaling.

756
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,560
 You blow into a balloon,

757
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,120
 and then the balloon material stops the air from falling out,

758
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,200
 and then you inhale it again.

759
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,320
 So you're saying the party's off?

760
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:55,120
 I'm saying we've got to get to the ISS and try this out ourselves.

761
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,720
 I was hoping that you guys would just accept this as a fact,

762
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,480
 but I can see there's holes.

763
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,640
 And parties cancelled, parties aren't.

764
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,160
 You're not coming to my space party.

765
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,440
 That's what I'm saying.

766
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,360
 Can I just do my favourite croissant story of this year?

767
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,360
 Obviously, I have one for each year.

768
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,520
 But did you guys read about the man

769
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,680
 who travelled 1,400 kilometres for a croissant?

770
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:15,920
 No.

771
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,520
 So this is this guy.

772
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,240
 He's a Belgian guy called Albert van Limbergen.

773
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,000
 He's from Liège in Belgium.

774
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,040
 And he's obsessed, as many people are, with lavender, weird.

775
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,200
 So he loves the smell, he loves the taste,

776
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,080
 he loves the appearance.

777
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,680
 And he was just listening to the radio one day,

778
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,560
 reading the paper,

779
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:36,000
 and he read about a patisserie in France

780
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,400
 that was doing lavender-infused croissants.

781
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,480
 So he thought the sensible thing to do is,

782
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,240
 I've got to get one of these croissants.

783
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,840
 I'm going to get on my bike and ride 1,400 kilometres

784
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,880
 in order to do that.

785
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,000
 And he did it.

786
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,880
 And it involved going up 1,200-metre mountain.

787
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,440
 That's higher than any mountain in England,

788
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,640
 just to access this croissant.

789
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,400
 He cycled 12 hours a day,

790
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,080
 100 kilometres a day,

791
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,520
 camped at night,

792
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,320
 met this baker at the other end called Frédéric,

793
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,320
 who makes the lavender croissants.

794
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,840
 And they chatted, apparently, about lavender and also life.

795
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,840
 So that covers all conversations.

796
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:19,200
 He was then asked, and then he had the croissants.

797
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,440
 And he was asked, "Oh God, how was the croissants?

798
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,320
 Was it worth it?"

799
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,240
 And he said, "To be honest,

800
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,240
 they would have been better if they put pastry cream in it

801
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,200
 like we do in Belgium."

802
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:33,600
 Other famous people that made people go crazy,

803
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,800
 obviously the Beatles.

804
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,360
 And the Beatles in 1963,

805
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,160
 they played their first ever gig in Glasgow.

806
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,520
 And when they came here,

807
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,680
 15 people came to that gig, right?

808
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:48,080
 They returned October of that very same year,

809
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,320
 and they played the Odeon.

810
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,160
 And it was so chaotic.

811
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,600
 It was basically the concert where it went nuts.

812
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,760
 And it was in Glasgow at the Odeon

813
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,120
 that they believed the first time

814
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,440
 the word "Beetlemania" was ever used.

815
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,600
 So that whole global thing

816
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,840
 started as a result of a gig in Glasgow,

817
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,880
 which is very cool.

818
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,040
 The Glasgow is just desperately trying to compensate.

819
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:13,360
 What I find amazing reading about all the...

820
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,440
 Because the screams of all the audience,

821
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,200
 predominantly it was girls screaming,

822
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,040
 their decibels, they would say, were so loud

823
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,560
 that if a plane, if a 747 was flying 100 feet above you,

824
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,360
 you wouldn't notice.

825
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,720
 It's like that louder thing.

826
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,000
 I thought you were going to say

827
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,320
 that people in the aeroplane would go, "What's that?"

828
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:28,640
 Yeah.

829
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,560
 Why are we flying so low to the city?

830
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,280
 What's going on?

831
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:37,840
 What I find amazing is the screams,

832
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,320
 and we've all...

833
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,840
 If you've ever seen any footage of "Beetlemania"

834
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,760
 and it's going crazy, you'll see that footage.

835
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,360
 But back in the day when the Beatles used to play,

836
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,360
 there used to be a thing that happened in the UK

837
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,880
 where at the start of a gig,

838
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,280
 everyone would stand up to sing "God Save the Queen."

839
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:49,840
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

840
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,600
 And then that would happen at the end of concerts.

841
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,800
 It would happen at the cinema.

842
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,440
 It would happen...

843
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,360
 You guys did do that before we started tonight, didn't you?

844
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:55,920
 Yes, yeah.

845
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,200
 And so at the end of Beatles' concerts,

846
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,080
 they used to...

847
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,560
 The screaming fans, we've seen how crazy would go.

848
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,120
 Yeah, yeah.

849
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,640
 "God Save the Queen" would come on.

850
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,840
 Everyone would go silent.

851
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,640
 They would respect it as soon as it finished.

852
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,600
 Again, why afterwards?

853
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,400
 Just containing it, which is phenomenal containment.

854
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,920
 Good way to quell a riot.

855
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,440
 I think the police should use it more often.

856
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,120
 I think they used that as the moment

857
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,280
 for the Beatles to escape from the buildings

858
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,520
 so that they could get out because no one could move,

859
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,320
 no one could do anything.

860
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,560
 So that was actually used as a tactic to get them out

861
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,040
 before they were mobbed by the audience coming on stage.

862
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:29,200
 Yeah.

863
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,280
 Pretty clever.

864
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,200
 Just quickly on sort of extra things you can have.

865
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,800
 10% of us here, about 40 people in this room,

866
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,160
 you will have an extra spleen.

867
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,400
 And you won't know it.

868
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,360
 How can we find out?

869
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,080
 Medicine, I suppose.

870
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,120
 As in, I don't think we can do it tonight

871
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,120
 by like a question and answer process.

872
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,680
 Is that a useful thing to have an extra spleen?

873
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,240
 Not at all.

874
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:52,560
 Doesn't it?

875
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,560
 You're doubly angry as a person, maybe.

876
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,120
 You know, like splenetic.

877
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:55,600
 Lovely.

878
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,440
 No, I don't think it does.

879
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,000
 They're very small.

880
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,200
 They're called accessory spleens.

881
00:28:59,200 --> 00:28:59,600
 They're normally,

882
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,720
 they're much smaller than your actual spleen.

883
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,480
 They're about one centimetre across.

884
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,160
 But there is also a syndrome

885
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,000
 where you have not just one spleen, not just two.

886
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,280
 You have multiple spleens.

887
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,000
 And that is called, genuinely called poly spleenia.

888
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,520
 Isn't that cool?

889
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,080
 Lovely.

890
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:12,720
 Nice name.

891
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,920
 Another nice name.

892
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,440
 Yeah, like Arsenal Backwards.

893
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,240
 Poly spleenia.

894
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,200
 We have messed up family.

895
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,320
 Yeah, poly spleenia.

896
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,000
 I do need to move us on.

897
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,480
 Well, just a three-headed lamb was born in 1577.

898
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,360
 Breaking news.

899
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,960
 And finally.

900
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,520
 A couple of interesting things about it.

901
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,720
 Though it had three heads,

902
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,000
 and if one of them bleated,

903
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,320
 the other two would always bleed alongside it.

904
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,480
 So they kind of sing in harmony a little bit.

905
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,200
 Like Hanson.

906
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,480
 Yeah.

907
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:45,920
 Bleed.

908
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:51,280
 And it was written about by a friend of the podcast,

909
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,960
 Amboise Poiret Pare,

910
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,200
 who you might remember.

911
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,680
 He was the guy who wrote about the woman

912
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,160
 who pretended to have a prolapsed rectum.

913
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:00,800
 Oh!

914
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,680
 Do you remember that?

915
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,480
 Yes.

916
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,480
 I mean, you would really have to be a fan of the podcast

917
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:04,960
 to remember that.

918
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,880
 Go back and listen to the first 100 episodes.

919
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,440
 But he wrote this amazing book

920
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,320
 about these kind of animals with two heads or whatever.

921
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,680
 And apparently in that time,

922
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,800
 it was thought that if an animal was born like that,

923
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,320
 then it would be some kind of terrible event would happen.

924
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,840
 So apparently in Florence,

925
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,880
 there was a cult that was born with a man's face,

926
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,880
 and immediately they went to war with Pisa.

927
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,240
 I mean, hang on.

928
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,440
 There definitely wasn't a cult

929
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,440
 that was born with a man's face, was there?

930
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,120
 According to Amboise Pare.

931
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,720
 Wow. We should have talked about that the whole time.

932
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,600
 Do you know there's a record?

933
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,560
 I haven't actually written this down,

934
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,640
 but I've got the rough memory of it in my head.

935
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,640
 There's a record for the quickest someone

936
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,640
 has fallen asleep under a situation

937
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,800
 where it's sort of like they were on stage

938
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,360
 and it was like, "Go! Try and fall asleep."

939
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,160
 Oh, how interesting.

940
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,480
 Yeah, so what do you think the record is for that?

941
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,760
 Well, I think on average,

942
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,120
 I fall asleep after about six to eight minutes.

943
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:03,920
 That's fast.

944
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,400
 Yeah.

945
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,040
 But with the pressure of audience and a...

946
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:07,840
 There's no pressure.

947
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,440
 If we say James now...

948
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:15,520
 Yeah, I'll say five minutes.

949
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,080
 I'll advance a bit.

950
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,000
 Yeah, so it was about 17 minutes.

951
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,400
 Wow.

952
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,120
 17 minutes.

953
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,200
 Yeah, I think it's the pressure of the stage

954
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:21,840
 and the kind of...

955
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,720
 I don't know, mate.

956
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,160
 During a lot of these live recordings,

957
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,080
 I could do it in about 10 seconds, I reckon.

958
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:31,200
 Some other people who might have discovered Helium before,

959
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,560
 Janssen, who I was talking about,

960
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:36,560
 this is three authors and scientists of sort

961
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,200
 called Annie Bessens, Charles Ledbetter,

962
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,760
 and Korup Malanj, Jin Rajdeza.

963
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,200
 And they wrote a book called "A Cult Chemistry"

964
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,480
 and they claimed that using clairvoyance,

965
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,520
 they could slow down the vibration of atoms

966
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:55,040
 and see the atoms and be able to tell what the elements are.

967
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:58,560
 Wow. That's amazing.

968
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:58,880
 All right.

969
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,240
 Yeah.

970
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,280
 Well, I've got Dan.

971
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:01,920
 Anyone else?

972
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,040
 I'm not sure.

973
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:06,560
 They said that they did this very, very early

974
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,960
 and they claimed to see four different gases

975
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,440
 in a mix of, you just, air.

976
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,800
 And they were asked, "What are these four gases?"

977
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,040
 And they knew what hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen

978
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,560
 had all been discovered at that time,

979
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,600
 so they knew it would be those.

980
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,080
 But there was a fourth one, what could it be?

981
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:22,960
 And they said, "What is it?"

982
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,120
 And they said, "Well, the atoms don't have labels on them.

983
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,480
 How are we supposed to know?"

984
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:31,040
 Anyway, soon afterwards, Helium was discovered

985
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,640
 and they said, "That's what it was."

986
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,200
 That's awesome.

987
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:35,680
 Great.

988
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,240
 But originally, they called that element a cultum.

989
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,400
 Oh, that's great.

990
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,040
 Should have stuck with that.

991
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:41,920
 Much better name.

992
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,480
 That's not dissimilar to the Mongolian brothers.

993
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,880
 So when they first had the idea,

994
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,520
 one of the brothers first had the idea for the hot-air balloon,

995
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:53,600
 he was staring at women's underwear, hanging over a fire, right?

996
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,440
 Sorry, what?

997
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,080
 Yeah, sorry.

998
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,840
 Yeah, so he was sitting by a fire.

999
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,240
 Was he exploring the nature of crime at the time?

1000
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:06,320
 It was his laundry and it was his wife's bloomers

1001
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,480
 and they were hanging over the fire.

1002
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,360
 Oh, that's clever.

1003
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,400
 And they were picking up from the flame underneath,

1004
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,040
 this sort of wind.

1005
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,680
 And so he thought, "Oh, I wonder if that could be something that could..."

1006
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,400
 No.

1007
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,040
 But what's amazing about that is he thought,

1008
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,640
 and so did his brother, that the reason that they were lifting up

1009
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:27,440
 was that the gas itself from the fire was a special new kind of gas,

1010
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,600
 which they called Montgolfier gas.

1011
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,200
 And the idea was that it had an element of levity about it

1012
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,960
 that was special, that was different to everything else.

1013
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,680
 So they did this whole process of getting us into the air

1014
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,480
 and hot-air balloons,

1015
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,080
 believing they'd discovered a mystical gas that doesn't exist now.

1016
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,360
 That's really interesting.

1017
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,640
 Oh, sorry, guys.

1018
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,160
 Sorry, Montgolfier.

1019
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,520
 No gas for you this time.

1020
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:54,800
 There's one interesting sort of spooky thing about Richard III,

1021
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,920
 and that is that there's...

1022
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,480
 I only learned this by doing this research this week,

1023
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,840
 and that is that there's a theory that Leicester City won the Premier League

1024
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,920
 with the help from Richard III's ghost.

1025
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,840
 Oh, yes.

1026
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,440
 And on the Leicester City website,

1027
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,000
 they have a lot of evidence as to why this is the case.

1028
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,720
 Really? Right.

1029
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:15,520
 So one bit of evidence is that on the day Richard III's body was found,

1030
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,840
 there was a football match in Blackburn

1031
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:22,240
 where a certain former non-league striker opened his scoring account

1032
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,560
 with his first ever league goal.

1033
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,600
 And who opened his scoring account on that day?

1034
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,080
 It was Jamie Vardy's account.

1035
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,360
 Oh!

1036
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,160
 One person's on the chair.

1037
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,280
 [LAUGHTER]

1038
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,240
 Andy, he was the captain of Leicester.

1039
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,320
 I read the legal news, and I think Jamie Vardy is.

1040
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,680
 [LAUGHTER]

1041
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,800
 What I find quite amazing as well is there's a huge discrepancy,

1042
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,440
 as we know, between women football players and male football players

1043
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,040
 and the pay range that they get.

1044
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,760
 And the Lionesses who won this year,

1045
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,840
 some of them, the day jobs that they have to do and still do

1046
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,440
 as a result of the pay not being enough maybe to sustain their whole life,

1047
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,960
 that's obviously going to change now,

1048
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,640
 and going forward, that's getting better.

1049
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,240
 But Jill Scott runs a coffee shop in Manchester,

1050
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,800
 and she was right back in the coffee shop afterwards.

1051
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,560
 There was photos of her just sweeping the floors

1052
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,880
 and running this small little coffee shop that she has.

1053
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,440
 And this, you know, can you imagine Ronaldo going back

1054
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,120
 to run his, like, pawn shop, you know?

1055
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,000
 Or like--

1056
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,640
 Sorry?

1057
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,040
 What?

1058
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:19,600
 We're the WN.

1059
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,000
 We're the WN.

1060
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,480
 We're the WN.

1061
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,160
 [LAUGHTER]

1062
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,440
 We don't think much of Ronaldo,

1063
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,280
 but, you know, I don't think we're going to accuse him of that.

1064
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,600
 [LAUGHTER]

1065
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,520
 The other thing, I think these people are quite lazy.

1066
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,400
 Yeah, good point, yeah.

1067
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:36,240
 These philosophers, like Socrates, Jesus, Confucius, Buddha.

1068
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,120
 That's lazy, stop.

1069
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,560
 Lazy, lazy, lazy.

1070
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,920
 [LAUGHTER]

1071
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,000
 None of them bothered to write their own shit down.

1072
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,520
 They just hoped some poor disciple behind them would write it all down.

1073
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,320
 Well, good thing those were all very small movements

1074
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,680
 with no followers in the world today.

1075
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,840
 [LAUGHTER]

1076
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,560
 OK, now Anna.

1077
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:57,120
 [LAUGHTER]

1078
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:57,840
 Oh, man.

1079
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:03,520
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

1080
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,920
 Ho, ho, ho.

1081
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,560
 It's still me.
