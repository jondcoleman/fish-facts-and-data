00:00:00,00:00:20,"""Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:20,00:00:23,to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.
00:00:23,00:00:28,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray"
00:00:28,00:00:32,and James Harkin and once again we have gathered round the microphones with our four favourite
00:00:32,00:00:38,"facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:38,00:00:41,"Starting with fact number one and that is James."""
00:00:41,00:00:47,"""Okay, my fact this week is that Cheryl Tweedy is the only member of Girls Allowed who doesn't"
00:00:47,00:00:49,"share her name with a type of potato."""
00:00:49,00:00:52,"""And is that deliberate?"
00:00:52,00:00:56,"Is that a snub from the potato community?"""
00:00:56,00:01:01,"""I think perhaps not, I think it's just a coincidence in the world."
00:01:01,00:01:04,In fact it's not even a coincidence because one of them doesn't share their name with
00:01:04,00:01:06,a potato.
00:01:06,00:01:09,If they all share names with potatoes that would be an incredible coincidence but as
00:01:09,00:01:11,"it happens one of them doesn't."""
00:01:11,00:01:16,"""I've not seen this come up anywhere on the internet James, this is not from Oh My God"
00:01:16,00:01:17,Facts right?
00:01:17,00:01:18,"What is this?"""
00:01:18,00:01:23,"""This is from my weird brain so I was reading an article about potatoes and I noticed there"
00:01:23,00:01:27,was a banana potato and an almond potato and I thought that was kind of weird.
00:01:27,00:01:32,I wonder if there's lots of other foodstuffs that are actually potatoes and so I found
00:01:32,00:01:36,a list on Wikipedia of potatoes that started working my way down it and I found one called
00:01:36,00:01:40,Nadine and I remembered that there was someone called Nadine in Girls Allowed so I thought
00:01:40,00:01:44,I wonder if there's other potatoes named after people from Girls Allowed.
00:01:44,00:01:48,So I found a website with all the world's potatoes on it and searched all the names
00:01:48,00:01:55,and there's a Kimberley and a Nicola and there is Maria Sarah so Sarah is in that name which
00:01:55,00:01:59,"I think counts because especially because Sarah, well Sarah Harding's mother is called"
00:01:59,00:02:02,"Marie so that's like a..."""
00:02:02,00:02:06,"""We're not going for the mums of the members of Girls Allowed?"""
00:02:06,00:02:09,"""Well it's an even more of a slam that Cheryl doesn't get one."
00:02:09,00:02:12,"They're heading into mum territory and not giving Cheryl."""
00:02:12,00:02:13,"""Yeah that's true."
00:02:13,00:02:14,"Sarah's got hers and her mums, yeah."""
00:02:14,00:02:19,"""There is a Cherie potato so that's quite close but yeah I'm not really trying to say"
00:02:19,00:02:24,anything important about the world here just there's a lot of types of potatoes and there's
00:02:24,00:02:29,a few members of Girls Allowed and they kind of some of the names overlap but I think it's
00:02:29,00:02:33,"made because there's lots of potatoes that are named after women so there's like Annabelle,"
00:02:33,00:02:40,"Anya, Augusta, Barbara, Cara, Charlotte, Desiree, Juliet, Linda, I mean that's just me listing"
00:02:40,00:02:42,"names of potatoes now so yeah."""
00:02:42,00:02:43,"""There's an Anna potato."""
00:02:43,00:02:44,"""Is there?"""
00:02:44,00:02:52,"""Yes but there isn't, Dan, James or Anandie so Anna is the Cheryl Tweedy of no such thing"
00:02:52,00:02:53,"as a fish."""
00:02:53,00:02:54,"""She's a reverse Tweedy."""
00:02:54,00:02:55,"""Reversed Tweedy, yeah."""
00:02:55,00:02:56,"""You're the Cheryl."""
00:02:56,00:03:01,"""No, no, no, she's the Cheryl in that her position in relation to potato naming is unique"
00:03:01,00:03:03,"among the members of no such thing as a fish."""
00:03:03,00:03:11,"""James, I'm just curious was this the agriculture and horticulture development board ahdb.org.uk"
00:03:11,00:03:13,"website that you got your potato names on?"""
00:03:13,00:03:17,"""No it wasn't actually, is that where you got your potato names from?"""
00:03:17,00:03:22,"""Certainly is and I mean I don't know if this is a comprehensive list, I suspect it's not"
00:03:22,00:03:31,"because there are thousands of potato varieties but there are romantic ones so there's Excalibur,"
00:03:31,00:03:38,"Lionheart, Mayan Twilight, Mulan Rouge is the kind of potato so these are all the kind"
00:03:38,00:03:39,of sexy ones.
00:03:39,00:03:43,"There is also- ""In what way outside of their name are they sexy, Anandie?"""
00:03:43,00:03:47,"""Just in their name, literally just in their name but they don't have shapes that are sort"
00:03:47,00:03:49,of ooh that's a hot potato.
00:03:49,00:03:54,"The Amorosa hot potato is not shaped like something especially sexual, no."""
00:03:54,00:03:58,"""But I do hope that on the back of this podcast you've changed the meaning of the phrase hot"
00:03:58,00:04:02,"potato to just literally mean a hot potato."""
00:04:02,00:04:09,"""There is another Girls Allowed and Potato link which is the only one I've found and"
00:04:09,00:04:13,this is solely because of googling off the back of James's fact but Nadine from Girls
00:04:13,00:04:17,Allowed is she Nadine Coyle?
00:04:17,00:04:23,She loves or loved when they were doing their gigs to eat a potato before going on stage
00:04:23,00:04:29,and in one of the interviews she did with the magazine she listed the top five ways
00:04:29,00:04:33,she liked to eat a potato okay I'm just going to run these past you because this is important.
00:04:33,00:04:37,"The top five ways Nadine Coyle likes to eat a potato are, see if you can spot the floor"
00:04:37,00:04:46,"here, mashed, chips, roast, jacket, and new."
00:04:46,00:04:51,"Now new is not a way of eating a potato, it's just a kind of potato."
00:04:51,00:04:55,"""She means boiled potato, I call them new."""
00:04:55,00:05:00,"""If you go to a restaurant and you order new potatoes with your steak you know what you're"
00:05:00,00:05:05,"going to get, you're not going to get chips and they go 'oh actually you know you ordered"
00:05:05,00:05:09,"new potatoes these are chipped new potatoes'."""
00:05:09,00:05:13,"I think Andy's right, Nadine's clearly a potato connoisseur, she's going to be devastated"
00:05:13,00:05:15,when she hears this episode.
00:05:15,00:05:19,"Our interviewer's just asking her questions about potatoes because she's Irish, that's"
00:05:19,00:05:20,why I like that.
00:05:20,00:05:23,"""Good point, I think she must have brought it up first but she would have a potato before"
00:05:23,00:05:29,"every show for a decade, whether in any of her five favorite methods or her four favorite"
00:05:29,00:05:32,"methods and one favorite kind of potato."""
00:05:32,00:05:38,The restaurant central in Malima in Peru has 50 different ways to prepare potatoes.
00:05:38,00:05:42,"""Have you read the list?"""
00:05:42,00:05:48,"""No but I have been there, what kind of potato did you go for, inside out potato or something?"""
00:05:48,00:05:52,"They kind of just give you what you get, it's like a menu but there was one dish that was"
00:05:52,00:05:57,"just potatoes in lots of different ways, so like one of them was quite salty and one"
00:05:57,00:06:01,of them was bread made out of potato and one of them was something else.
00:06:01,00:06:06,"""Cool, James did you visit the International Potato Center while you were there in Peru?"""
00:06:06,00:06:11,"""You know what, I didn't, I was on holiday and even I will draw the line at dragging"
00:06:11,00:06:14,"my wife to the International Potato Center."""
00:06:14,00:06:16,"""You don't draw the line."""
00:06:16,00:06:17,"""As is!"""
00:06:17,00:06:18,"""That's well within your line."""
00:06:18,00:06:19,"""You're just sitting there regretting it now."""
00:06:19,00:06:22,"""Okay fine, I didn't know it was that."""
00:06:22,00:06:28,"""The truth comes out, yeah there's an international potato center, I managed to find a slideshow"
00:06:28,00:06:34,of interesting potatoes that they have online and it was quite a journey going through the
00:06:34,00:06:35,slides.
00:06:35,00:06:41,They have a potato that they like to show which is called the Yana Pina Potato and that's
00:06:41,00:06:43,nicknamed the Weeping Bride.
00:06:43,00:06:51,The idea is that the potato needs to be peeled properly by a to-be-wife so that the mother-in-law
00:06:51,00:06:56,can see that they've got the skills to peel the potatoes as such.
00:06:56,00:07:01,"It's a very lumpy potato, if they can get past all of the bumps and the crevices it"
00:07:01,00:07:03,shows that they can navigate a potato.
00:07:03,00:07:04,That's interesting.
00:07:04,00:07:08,"Peru takes its potatoes very seriously, they have got the International Potato Center."
00:07:08,00:07:11,"Then they have occasional turf wars, don't they, with chili."
00:07:11,00:07:15,"A lot of international potatoes, the really big hitters of the potato world, come from"
00:07:15,00:07:20,"an island, I think it's Chiloé, which is off the coast of chili and potatoes are so"
00:07:20,00:07:25,popular there that some people will carry a potato in their pocket to ward off the spells
00:07:25,00:07:26,of spiteful neighbours.
00:07:26,00:07:34,"There was a guy called André Contreras-Mendes, he died in 2014, but his kind of lifetime's"
00:07:34,00:07:42,ambition was to go around Chiloé just trying to find unusual potatoes because in Chiloé
00:07:42,00:07:47,you had a lot of people who kind of lived on their little homestead and you would have
00:07:47,00:07:52,lots of elderly women who would look after the potatoes and then they would pass down
00:07:52,00:07:57,"the seeds of their potatoes to the next generation, to the next generation, to the next generation."
00:07:57,00:08:01,So if you didn't have someone going around kind of collecting the seeds and saving these
00:08:01,00:08:06,"types of potato, then when the generations died with the last old lady then the potatoes"
00:08:06,00:08:07,would two die.
00:08:07,00:08:08,"Okay, very cool."
00:08:08,00:08:11,What kind of a name is Chiloé if it's part of chili?
00:08:11,00:08:17,I mean they've literally just dropped a potato-shaped thing into the middle of the world.
00:08:17,00:08:19,Seriously unimaginative day.
00:08:19,00:08:20,Yeah.
00:08:20,00:08:21,It's amazing.
00:08:21,00:08:26,"Mr Potato Head has rebranded, big news this year."
00:08:26,00:08:27,Okay.
00:08:27,00:08:32,"He's just Potato Head now, or in fact they are just Potato Head, to be more inclusive of"
00:08:32,00:08:36,"the brand, because the Potato Head family is a whole family, I don't think I realise"
00:08:36,00:08:37,that.
00:08:37,00:08:38,"Yeah, have you not seen Toy Story?"
00:08:38,00:08:42,"Oh my God, there's a Mrs Potato Head right there in Toy Story, isn't there?"
00:08:42,00:08:44,He just steals the attention so much.
00:08:44,00:08:48,"I think it was that the overall brand was called Mr Potato Head, now the overall brand"
00:08:48,00:08:49,is Potato Head.
00:08:49,00:08:53,"And they made a big thing about saying, look you can still buy a Mr Potato Head within the"
00:08:53,00:08:55,family of Potato Head.
00:08:55,00:08:56,It was a really…
00:08:56,00:09:03,"It was one of the, it was a crazed media panic of the most predictable type."
00:09:03,00:09:07,Every headline saying Mr Potato Head's gone gender neutral and even though the press release
00:09:07,00:09:13,"it's gone out is, on every Mr Potato Head packet it says Mr Potato Head to make it clear"
00:09:13,00:09:17,"that's who you're buying, they're just saying, look we can't call a whole brand"
00:09:17,00:09:22,"Mr Potato Head, that's like my whole family just being named after my dad, actually I"
00:09:22,00:09:26,suppose that's what surname's on.
00:09:26,00:09:31,"But like, you can really imagine that press release going through the entire company and"
00:09:31,00:09:36,"everyone just going, this'll be fine won't it, no one's going to take offence to this."
00:09:36,00:09:41,"You know, the biggest Mr Potato Head in history I guess you could say is a guy who we've"
00:09:41,00:09:48,"mentioned once before, who's Antoine Augustin Parmentier, but he's the guy who rehabilitated"
00:09:48,00:09:49,potatoes in France.
00:09:49,00:09:53,"They were seen as being incredibly dangerous, even though people were eating them in Germany"
00:09:53,00:10:01,"at that time, and he made them popular by this long PR campaign to get French people"
00:10:01,00:10:07,"into potatoes, but it was partly because France was already looking for an excuse to eat potatoes"
00:10:07,00:10:12,"if you like, because they had had failed grain harvests and things and there were big worries"
00:10:12,00:10:18,"about this and there were prizes to identify alternative sources of nourishment, such a"
00:10:18,00:10:21,cool era when the government would just say there's a prize if you can think of anything
00:10:21,00:10:27,"we can eat, and he wrote an essay on potatoes and it won, and then he hung out with friend"
00:10:27,00:10:32,"of the podcast, Benjamin Franklin, and was telling him all about these great things"
00:10:32,00:10:36,"called potatoes, and then he ended up hosting a dinner, Parmentier, where everything was"
00:10:36,00:10:37,made of potatoes.
00:10:37,00:10:40,"What, like the chairs, the table, the door, the house?"
00:10:40,00:10:43,"Oh, God's sake."
00:10:43,00:10:48,"Kind of like this restaurant James went to, everything on the plates was made of potatoes,"
00:10:48,00:10:52,"so they served fish that was actually made of potatoes, and then they drank vodka, which"
00:10:52,00:10:54,was distilled from potatoes.
00:10:54,00:10:57,That sounds like a very bland meal.
00:10:57,00:11:01,"I don't know if salt was allowed or not, I think that's a big part of it, yeah."
00:11:01,00:11:02,Every bite is disappointing.
00:11:02,00:11:07,"I agree with Anna, plot twist on every moment, the fork is made of potatoes, what, my plate"
00:11:07,00:11:13,"is made of potatoes, the waiter is made of potatoes, a potato waiter, and then you look"
00:11:13,00:11:19,"down at your own body and it's, I'm a potato."
00:11:19,00:11:24,"Potatoes outside of Mr. Potato Head, as Anna was mentioning, being in the news, it has"
00:11:24,00:11:27,had quite a lot of press since the pandemic started.
00:11:27,00:11:31,"I was looking just in, you know, news items to see where it's popped up."
00:11:31,00:11:33,Quite a few headlines.
00:11:33,00:11:36,Woman accidentally turned herself into a potato for video meeting and couldn't figure out
00:11:36,00:11:37,how to fix it.
00:11:37,00:11:39,Do you remember that?
00:11:39,00:11:44,"She was, yeah, Lizette Ocampo was her name, political director at People for the American"
00:11:44,00:11:50,"Way, and there was a filter on her Microsoft Teams app, which turned her into a potato."
00:11:50,00:11:55,"She couldn't change it, had to do the entire meeting as a potato, a speaking potato."
00:11:55,00:12:02,"Microsoft have developed a filter that knocks out potato chip noises from your conversation,"
00:12:02,00:12:06,"this is another headline, when you're talking on Microsoft Teams."
00:12:06,00:12:07,What noises potato chips make?
00:12:07,00:12:14,"So if you're, sorry, what I meant is if you're, crisps, exactly, so if you've got your hand"
00:12:14,00:12:19,"in a bag of crisps and you're talking, it will knock out that noise because the AI has"
00:12:19,00:12:21,recognized that noise.
00:12:21,00:12:22,Yeah.
00:12:22,00:12:23,So it kind of filters it out.
00:12:23,00:12:27,"So you can, you know, as everyone does, eat potato crisps during meetings."
00:12:27,00:12:30,Stop calling them potato crisps or potato chips.
00:12:30,00:12:31,What do you mean?
00:12:31,00:12:32,What are you doing?
00:12:32,00:12:33,"But they are crisps, right?"
00:12:33,00:12:34,"Oh, Anna's about to strike a nationalist tone."
00:12:34,00:12:38,"She's just saying, she's just like crisps, I think, is what she's about to say."
00:12:38,00:12:39,Just crisps.
00:12:39,00:12:40,Just call them what we've always called them.
00:12:40,00:12:41,Okay.
00:12:41,00:12:44,"I was just really trying to drill home the potato connection, even though obviously they're"
00:12:44,00:12:46,still connected without the word involved.
00:12:46,00:12:49,"Oh, I like that you're helping the kids out."
00:12:49,00:12:50,Yeah.
00:12:50,00:12:51,I just want to make sure.
00:12:51,00:12:57,"And then in 2020, last one that I found was the inaugural potato photographer of the year"
00:12:57,00:12:58,prize.
00:12:58,00:12:59,"Oh, yeah."
00:12:59,00:13:03,"That must be a hard job because they're quite hard to catch in the wild, aren't they?"
00:13:03,00:13:06,They're always hiding behind a bush.
00:13:06,00:13:07,Exactly.
00:13:07,00:13:08,Nature's moles.
00:13:08,00:13:09,Yeah.
00:13:09,00:13:10,Yeah.
00:13:10,00:13:14,It's an annual award that's happening every year now going forward a thousand pounds
00:13:14,00:13:19,"to the winner and you send in, yeah, you send in your picture of a potato that you've taken."
00:13:19,00:13:21,It's a very creative thing.
00:13:21,00:13:26,So the 2020 winner went down to a potato getting a lockdown haircut.
00:13:26,00:13:30,"So it's obviously quite stylistic and artistic, a lot of these photos."
00:13:30,00:13:35,Some of the potatoes are actually potatoes in the wild or people planting potatoes or
00:13:35,00:13:36,going through fields.
00:13:36,00:13:37,I would have gone for it.
00:13:37,00:13:42,"Instead of a haircut, Dan, I would have gone for a Shakespeare King Lear, but with potatoes."
00:13:42,00:13:47,And you've got a potato Duke of Gloucester having its eyes removed because that's what
00:13:47,00:13:49,"happens in the play, spoiler alert."
00:13:49,00:13:53,"Oh, because potato, you call those things eyes on potatoes."
00:13:53,00:13:54,Yeah.
00:13:54,00:13:55,Exactly.
00:13:55,00:13:57,"And in King Lear, the Duke of Gloucester is blinded."
00:13:57,00:13:58,Okay.
00:13:58,00:14:01,"Well, 2022 potato photographer of the year competition."
00:14:01,00:14:02,Here we come.
00:14:02,00:14:06,Have you guys heard of the ketchup and chips plant?
00:14:06,00:14:07,No.
00:14:07,00:14:08,No.
00:14:08,00:14:09,No.
00:14:09,00:14:10,Is this an actual plant?
00:14:10,00:14:15,"You can buy from a company called Tom Tato and on the top above ground, it's a tomato"
00:14:15,00:14:19,"plant and below ground, it's a potato plant."
00:14:19,00:14:24,"So you can get from one plant, your chips and your ketchup."
00:14:24,00:14:25,Amazing.
00:14:25,00:14:26,That's so good.
00:14:26,00:14:28,"And when you say chips, James, sorry, can I just clarify what you mean?"
00:14:28,00:14:29,Potato chips.
00:14:29,00:14:30,Sorry.
00:14:30,00:14:33,Also not potato crisps.
00:14:33,00:14:34,Can you speak of chips though?
00:14:34,00:14:38,Can you guys guess what the egg and chips plant is that you can buy from the same company?
00:14:38,00:14:39,Yeah.
00:14:39,00:14:40,Egg and chips.
00:14:40,00:14:46,"It's a, oh, it's a chicken which lays a potato."
00:14:46,00:14:47,"Oh, beautiful."
00:14:47,00:14:49,It's GM food gone mad.
00:14:49,00:14:52,"That would be great, but this is a plant."
00:14:52,00:14:53,"Oh, okay."
00:14:53,00:14:58,"But before we get to Andy quickly, that definitely, if we get a photo of that, it's potato photographer"
00:14:58,00:15:01,of the year 2022.
00:15:01,00:15:03,No question.
00:15:03,00:15:04,Yeah.
00:15:04,00:15:07,An egg and chips plant.
00:15:07,00:15:09,"So it's got to be, it's got to be a potato below ground."
00:15:09,00:15:10,Yep.
00:15:10,00:15:11,You've got the halfway there.
00:15:11,00:15:14,"But are you, chickens don't grow on trees as a second."
00:15:14,00:15:17,"Riddle me that, Sada."
00:15:17,00:15:18,"Is it an, is it an aubergine?"
00:15:18,00:15:19,It's an egg plant.
00:15:19,00:15:20,He's got it.
00:15:20,00:15:21,He's on the ground.
00:15:21,00:15:24,"Aubergine above ground, potatoes below ground."
00:15:24,00:15:25,So good.
00:15:25,00:15:29,"It sounds, that sounds like one of those sayings, aubergine's above ground, potatoes below ground."
00:15:29,00:15:32,"It sounds like I'm this in the streets, but I'm this in the sheets."
00:15:32,00:15:33,You know?
00:15:33,00:15:36,"I'm an aubergine above ground, but I'm a potato below."
00:15:36,00:15:38,That's actually horrible.
00:15:38,00:15:39,It's disgusting.
00:15:39,00:15:49,"I'm not sure you want the potatoes to be there, isn't it?"
00:15:49,00:15:54,"Okay, it's time for fact number two, and that's my fact."
00:15:54,00:15:59,My fact this week is that dissecting cadavers doesn't put you off your food.
00:15:59,00:16:01,"In fact, it actually makes you hungrier."
00:16:01,00:16:02,Mmm.
00:16:02,00:16:04,Do you mean dissecting?
00:16:04,00:16:05,No.
00:16:05,00:16:07,Say it normally.
00:16:07,00:16:08,Sorry.
00:16:08,00:16:09,Dissecting.
00:16:09,00:16:10,Dissecting.
00:16:10,00:16:11,Yeah.
00:16:11,00:16:12,"It sounds pronounced, guys."
00:16:12,00:16:13,"So, fun fact for listeners."
00:16:13,00:16:19,"We had a chat before this episode recording started about how to say the word dissecting,"
00:16:19,00:16:23,and it turns out that dissecting is when you're only dividing something into two.
00:16:23,00:16:24,Yes.
00:16:24,00:16:26,But dissecting is only what pedants say.
00:16:26,00:16:31,"So in James Bond movies, when that laser is heading towards him to cut him right in half,"
00:16:31,00:16:35,"the villains should be saying, ""No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to be dissected."""
00:16:35,00:16:36,"No, dissected."
00:16:36,00:16:37,What?
00:16:37,00:16:38,Are you kidding?
00:16:38,00:16:42,"Because that's in two, and he would be cut in two pieces."
00:16:42,00:16:44,"No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to dissect."
00:16:44,00:16:45,Yeah.
00:16:45,00:16:46,Yeah.
00:16:46,00:16:47,No.
00:16:47,00:16:48,He doesn't want James to dissect something.
00:16:48,00:16:51,Dissecting is an active verb.
00:16:51,00:16:55,"So, Dan, what about these cadavers that I hear so much about?"
00:16:55,00:16:56,"Yeah, sorry."
00:16:56,00:16:57,That is disgusting.
00:16:57,00:16:58,Let's go back to your fact.
00:16:58,00:16:59,People get hungry with dead bodies.
00:16:59,00:17:00,Is it because it's meat?
00:17:00,00:17:02,"Like, they're like literally cutting up meat?"
00:17:02,00:17:06,"No, it's not quite that, although it's a possibility that that's involved as well."
00:17:06,00:17:13,"What it is, is that in order for students, medical students, to practice dissection on"
00:17:13,00:17:17,"bodies, the bodies have to be preserved, and they're preserved in formaldehyde."
00:17:17,00:17:21,"So, that's a chemical that helps for them to stay fresh, and they can go through, and"
00:17:21,00:17:23,they can practice all sorts of things.
00:17:23,00:17:28,"Now, there's a phenomenon which has been reported by so many doctors online, and I was told"
00:17:28,00:17:32,"this by a doctor friend, and I happen to have two doctor friends, so I asked another one,"
00:17:32,00:17:37,"""Have you ever heard of, or experienced, when you were dissecting a body, a thing called"
00:17:37,00:17:39,"formaldehyde hunger?"""
00:17:39,00:17:42,"And he went, ""Oh my God, I didn't even know that was a thing."""
00:17:42,00:17:46,"Yes, I've had that, that entire time, and everyone online talks about it."
00:17:46,00:17:51,"So, the idea is formaldehyde does something to you, where it makes you extremely hungry,"
00:17:51,00:17:55,"and if you look online at medical students talking about it, they talk about, it's not"
00:17:55,00:17:59,"just a hunger, they get starving to the point where, as they're wrapping up, they all start"
00:17:59,00:18:02,"talking about what they're going to eat, they exchange menu ideas."
00:18:02,00:18:08,"And one of them's like, ""Wait a minute, this guy had nine fingers when he came in."""
00:18:08,00:18:10,It seems to be pretty widely acknowledged.
00:18:10,00:18:14,I couldn't believe that all my doctor friends hadn't told me about it before when I asked
00:18:14,00:18:15,"them, but they were all like, ""Oh, yeah, of course."
00:18:15,00:18:16,"Yeah, you're starving."
00:18:16,00:18:17,Absolutely.
00:18:17,00:18:19,"All you want to do is bite the head off that dead body."""
00:18:19,00:18:22,"It's like, ""Well, why haven't you mentioned this before?"""
00:18:22,00:18:23,It's very weird.
00:18:23,00:18:27,"There was a study in rats, wasn't there, like there always has been."
00:18:27,00:18:32,"And they injected rats with formalin, which is where you get formaldehyde, and you put"
00:18:32,00:18:33,it in water.
00:18:33,00:18:39,"And when they gave these rats formalin, it increased how much sodium they took in."
00:18:39,00:18:41,"So, they really craved salt."
00:18:41,00:18:45,"So, that is a tiny bit of science, which suggests that it might be true."
00:18:45,00:18:51,"But obviously, for obvious reasons, one of which being that formaldehyde is toxic and"
00:18:51,00:18:54,"pasnogenic, they haven't done the experiments on humans yet."
00:18:54,00:18:55,Yes.
00:18:55,00:18:59,"They do think that formaldehyde might cause sick building syndrome, which I'd never heard"
00:18:59,00:19:01,"of, but which is what it sounds like."
00:19:01,00:19:02,The building gets sick.
00:19:02,00:19:03,"Oh, okay."
00:19:03,00:19:05,"Apparently, it's not what it sounds like."
00:19:05,00:19:09,"To be fair, that is exactly what you made it sound like."
00:19:09,00:19:10,Sorry.
00:19:10,00:19:11,Yeah.
00:19:11,00:19:12,I've just seen how you could hear that.
00:19:12,00:19:14,It's where people get sick in a building.
00:19:14,00:19:18,Sick person in a building syndrome is the full name.
00:19:18,00:19:22,"And it's because formaldehyde has loads of uses I didn't know about, but one of them"
00:19:22,00:19:25,is as glue on wooden furniture.
00:19:25,00:19:28,"And if you're in a building which has lots of that, you can get a headache or you can"
00:19:28,00:19:30,get nauseous.
00:19:30,00:19:35,And they found in a study in Japan in about the year 2000 that you can scatter lots of
00:19:35,00:19:42,"tea bags about the place, and if you do that, it'll soak it up and you will get less ill."
00:19:42,00:19:45,Soaks up about 60 to 90% of the formaldehyde in the air.
00:19:45,00:19:46,Really?
00:19:46,00:19:47,You just scatter them around the building?
00:19:47,00:19:48,Yeah.
00:19:48,00:19:49,That seems to be what they did.
00:19:49,00:19:50,Yeah.
00:19:50,00:19:51,That feels risky to me.
00:19:51,00:19:58,"As a tea lover, I would think, oh great, someone's left out some tea bags for me."
00:19:58,00:19:59,I'll just brew these up.
00:19:59,00:20:04,"If you just see tea bags on the floor, you just pick them up and think, well, I might"
00:20:04,00:20:05,as well use some tea.
00:20:05,00:20:06,It depends.
00:20:06,00:20:09,"It is context dependent, but it's mostly dependent on how recently I've had a cup of"
00:20:09,00:20:10,tea.
00:20:10,00:20:13,"And if it's been more than half an hour, I'll probably pick it up."
00:20:13,00:20:20,I was looking into the history of dissection and how medical students have been doing over
00:20:20,00:20:21,the years.
00:20:21,00:20:27,"And I was reading a fantastic book called The Butchering Art, which is by Lindsay Fitzharris."
00:20:27,00:20:31,"And in the intro for a book, it just paints this amazing picture of what it was like in"
00:20:31,00:20:35,the 19th century in London when dissections were done publicly.
00:20:35,00:20:41,So you would go into a theater and the rafters above where people could observe medical students
00:20:41,00:20:46,"would be packed not only with medical students, but random people off the street who were"
00:20:46,00:20:48,just fascinated with what was going on.
00:20:48,00:20:52,They had to have people come in and make way and push people back so that the surgeon had
00:20:52,00:20:54,enough space to actually do the operation.
00:20:54,00:20:58,"That's how tight it was, and there would be heckles as they were doing it if people were"
00:20:58,00:20:59,in the way.
00:20:59,00:21:02,"So someone's doing surgery and people are going, heads, heads, saying, get your head"
00:21:02,00:21:04,out of the way so I get a better view of it.
00:21:04,00:21:07,"All right, this is what we want you to cut off."
00:21:07,00:21:08,Elbows next.
00:21:08,00:21:12,"Shoulders, knees, toes."
00:21:12,00:21:15,And this is a thing that used to be public entertainment.
00:21:15,00:21:19,It went back all the way to the Renaissance where it was actually sort of billed as public
00:21:19,00:21:23,"entertainment to the point that when they were doing it, they would often have someone"
00:21:23,00:21:30,playing the flute to a dissection that was going on in the theater.
00:21:30,00:21:33,I thought you'd seen a ghost just then.
00:21:33,00:21:35,And I thought you'd seen it in one of our zooms.
00:21:35,00:21:39,And I thought it was like behind my back or something.
00:21:39,00:21:43,And that's how scared we've got you mispronouncing things.
00:21:43,00:21:44,I feel terrible.
00:21:44,00:21:47,Like this is an abusive relationship.
00:21:47,00:21:51,"It does sound amazing, the shows that were on, and they were mostly in the winter in"
00:21:51,00:21:55,the European theaters because it was just too hot in the summer and they needed to make
00:21:55,00:22:00,"a dissection take a couple of weeks, a full dissection would take weeks."
00:22:00,00:22:04,But I really liked the rules that you had of who was doing the cutting up.
00:22:04,00:22:09,"So in Padua, there was a lector, a sektor, and an ostenzial."
00:22:09,00:22:11,Those were the three jobs that you would have.
00:22:11,00:22:15,And a lector was a lecturer who was lecturing while it was going on.
00:22:15,00:22:20,"The sektor, as you might guess, is the barber who's doing the cutting up, the barber surgeon"
00:22:20,00:22:21,who's doing the operation.
00:22:21,00:22:27,"And the ostenzial is just pointing to the bit of the body being dissected at the moment,"
00:22:27,00:22:31,which feels like being the kind of sheet music turner rather than one of the two main
00:22:31,00:22:32,roles.
00:22:32,00:22:35,"Because otherwise, people don't know which bit is the arm and which bit is the leg and"
00:22:35,00:22:36,stuff.
00:22:36,00:22:37,You're right.
00:22:37,00:22:38,You're right.
00:22:38,00:22:41,I guess I'd just focus on which bit the surgeon was clearly cutting.
00:22:41,00:22:42,Yeah.
00:22:42,00:22:46,You would have thought that's an unnecessary second pointer to have when you've got the
00:22:46,00:22:48,knife as the first pointer.
00:22:48,00:22:50,Have you guys heard of Susan Potter?
00:22:50,00:22:51,No.
00:22:51,00:22:57,"So Susan Potter, in the year 2000, she was 72 years old and she donated her body to medicine."
00:22:57,00:23:04,"And she has died now, unfortunately, but they cut her body into 27,000 slivers, each one"
00:23:04,00:23:09,"thinner than a human hair, and then photographed each side of it, each side of each slice."
00:23:09,00:23:14,"And now she is like a virtual cadaver, which medical students can use whenever they need"
00:23:14,00:23:16,to do any studying.
00:23:16,00:23:17,That's unbelievable.
00:23:17,00:23:21,"So is that, is it so that you can be scanned sort of at any, you can just see what's going"
00:23:21,00:23:22,on at every single level.
00:23:22,00:23:23,And I suppose that's...
00:23:23,00:23:24,Yeah.
00:23:24,00:23:25,"It's like a 3D tour of the body, right?"
00:23:25,00:23:26,Yeah.
00:23:26,00:23:27,Exactly that.
00:23:27,00:23:31,"So you can see the inside of your liver, or you can see the edge of your liver, or you"
00:23:31,00:23:34,can see any part of the body.
00:23:34,00:23:38,"And the really interesting thing about it is when she donated her body, she'd just been"
00:23:38,00:23:42,"in a major car accident, and she was in a wheelchair, and people thought that she only"
00:23:42,00:23:43,had a year to live.
00:23:43,00:23:49,"And she continued to live for another 14 years after that, and kind of became quite friendly"
00:23:49,00:23:51,with the doctor who was going to do all the work.
00:23:51,00:23:56,And they interviewed her quite a lot during that 14 years.
00:23:56,00:24:01,"And now the plan, I don't think this is available yet, but in the future the plan might be that"
00:24:01,00:24:08,"if you're a student looking at Mrs Potter's kidneys, you might, like Siri, ask her about"
00:24:08,00:24:13,"her kidneys, and she could say, ""Oh, I've had these kidneys for 72 years,"" and blah,"
00:24:13,00:24:17,"blah, blah, and you would even be able to hear the voice of the person whose body you're"
00:24:17,00:24:18,looking at.
00:24:18,00:24:19,That's incredible.
00:24:19,00:24:23,They should make it that she just does constant small chat with the while they're trying to
00:24:23,00:24:24,do it.
00:24:24,00:24:26,Do you seem a very clever boy?
00:24:26,00:24:30,Your parents must be very proud of you.
00:24:30,00:24:31,Wow.
00:24:31,00:24:35,"Makes you hungry, doesn't it, this?"
00:24:35,00:24:40,"Do you guys know, so public dissections obviously stopped hundreds and hundreds of years ago,"
00:24:40,00:24:45,"or hundreds of years ago rather, but there was one performed publicly in London in 2009."
00:24:45,00:24:47,"Oh yeah, I think I remember this."
00:24:47,00:24:48,"Oh, yeah."
00:24:48,00:24:49,Was that Gunther von Hagen?
00:24:49,00:24:50,"That's right, yeah."
00:24:50,00:24:54,"So, Gunther von Hagen's, and it was filmed for Channel 4, and it went out, and so Gunther"
00:24:54,00:24:59,"von Hagen's, he's the guy who in Piccadilly Circus in London, there used to be a giant"
00:24:59,00:25:04,"Ripley's Believe It or Not Museum, and it's now this thing called Body World Exhibitions,"
00:25:04,00:25:08,"and he's worked on this method, which is called plastination, and plastination is the"
00:25:08,00:25:13,idea of taking certain body fats and tissues out and replacing them with silicon so that
00:25:13,00:25:17,"the body doesn't deteriorate or smell, and so you can go inside and you can see all these"
00:25:17,00:25:23,"dissected different things, and so it's pretty gross, and in 2009 he did this big show for"
00:25:23,00:25:29,"Channel 4 where he had a body that was donated, dissected on TV, handing out to the crowd"
00:25:29,00:25:33,"who were sitting there in their hundreds, bits of the body to look at closer on little"
00:25:33,00:25:39,"plates as it was going around, yeah, and he was told that this was illegal and that he"
00:25:39,00:25:43,"was going to be arrested, in fact police were there in the room to make an arrest if they"
00:25:43,00:25:47,"thought that it went into a territory which was dubious, but he didn't get arrested on"
00:25:47,00:25:48,the road.
00:25:48,00:25:50,"- How, sorry, police are not trained for that kind of decision."
00:25:50,00:25:54,"They sent them inside the Ripley's Believe It or Not shot, were like, okay, watch this"
00:25:54,00:25:56,weird creepy shit happen.
00:25:56,00:25:59,"If you think it's a bit dodgy, arrest them."
00:25:59,00:26:01,- What are they looking out for?
00:26:01,00:26:02,What are they looking at?
00:26:02,00:26:06,"Like if he kills someone else and starts dissecting them, then you definitely slap the cuffs on"
00:26:06,00:26:07,him.
00:26:07,00:26:08,- It's gotta just be that.
00:26:08,00:26:12,"- His thing is, he's now quite ill, in 2011 he got diagnosed with Parkinson's, and so"
00:26:12,00:26:18,"his plan now is that he is going to be turned into one of his bits of art, and is going"
00:26:18,00:26:24,"to be in this Piccadilly Circus body world as an exhibition, just as part of the display,"
00:26:24,00:26:28,"and it's his wife who's going to do it to him, and she doesn't want to do it."
00:26:28,00:26:33,"So he's granted her a year of not doing it, but then she has to."
00:26:33,00:26:35,"- That's not a year, that's not a grunt of anything."
00:26:35,00:26:38,"That's a year of worrying about this thing you have to do, apparently."
00:26:38,00:26:40,"- Oh, so she doesn't really have to do it, does she?"
00:26:40,00:26:43,"- I don't think you can make that statement in your will saying, ""I want someone to cut"
00:26:43,00:26:45,"me up and plastinate me after my death."""
00:26:45,00:26:50,"- She said that, he said to me, ""Angelina, you were entitled to freeze me down to minus"
00:26:50,00:26:55,"25 degrees for one year, but after that time, you really need to put your hands on me, because"
00:26:55,00:26:57,"otherwise I will get freeze-burned."""
00:26:57,00:26:58,So-
00:26:58,00:27:04,"- When he gets down to minus 25, he'll be gone to von Haagen-Dazs."
00:27:04,00:27:13,"- Please release that as an ice cream hug and dust, if you're listening, please."
00:27:13,00:27:21,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Anna."
00:27:21,00:27:26,"- My fact this week is that on the day that the border between Spain and Gibraltar opened,"
00:27:26,00:27:32,"the key to the gate didn't work, and they had to call a locksmith to let people through."
00:27:32,00:27:40,"I love this, it just sounds like such an awkward moment, and I kind of love the fact like borders"
00:27:40,00:27:42,just being physical gates.
00:27:42,00:27:48,"So the border between Spain and Gibraltar was closed by Franco in 1969, and no one could"
00:27:48,00:27:54,"really cross until 1982, December 1982, when it was reopened, and I was listening to an"
00:27:54,00:27:59,"interview with a guy called Tito Belejo-Smith, who is a Gibraltarian, and he was there at"
00:27:59,00:28:03,"the time, and he said it came to midnight when they were going to open the gate, and"
00:28:03,00:28:07,he first said there was this argument between all the top officials over which one of them
00:28:07,00:28:11,"was going to open the gate, eventually the head of customs sees the key, said I'll do"
00:28:11,00:28:17,"it, but the key didn't work, and they couldn't find the right key, and eventually they had"
00:28:17,00:28:18,to call a locksmith.
00:28:18,00:28:19,- So funny.
00:28:19,00:28:22,- It's weird that the border was closed.
00:28:22,00:28:25,Was it a power political move by General Franco?
00:28:25,00:28:26,"- Yes, it basically was."
00:28:26,00:28:29,"It was quite famous for that, wasn't it, Franco?"
00:28:29,00:28:30,- He loved a power move.
00:28:30,00:28:31,- He did.
00:28:31,00:28:33,He was pissed off with Gibraltar.
00:28:33,00:28:39,"Spain has a history of being, and there was a referendum, I think, in the late '60s about"
00:28:39,00:28:44,"whether Gibraltarians wanted to be British or wanted to have Spanish sovereignty, and"
00:28:44,00:28:51,"it's the most astonishing result ever, because no vote rigging, no corruption, but 96% turnout"
00:28:51,00:28:57,and 99.6% of people voted to stick with British sovereignty.
00:28:57,00:29:03,"- Quite similar to the vote in Crimea as well, wasn't it, which was no vote rigging, no corruption,"
00:29:03,00:29:07,"just a massive, massive win for one of the sides."
00:29:07,00:29:14,"- Huge majority, both equally valid, but yeah, only 44 people voted to have Spanish sovereignty"
00:29:14,00:29:18,"against 12,138 who voted to be British, so Franco was kind of pissed off, and he got more"
00:29:18,00:29:23,and more hard line in terms of who could cross the border and when and trade between Gibraltar
00:29:23,00:29:27,"and Spain, and then he just shot it down, a little big fence, and literally, it's amazing"
00:29:27,00:29:31,"when you hear about it, I hadn't realised that Gibraltarians just couldn't get across."
00:29:31,00:29:36,"You could get a boat to Morocco and then sail the way around, but there was an interview"
00:29:36,00:29:39,"with a guy who just said, you know, it was 15 when they opened the border, and it was"
00:29:39,00:29:43,"the first time I'd ever seen a cow, 'cause I went across and they had farms on the other"
00:29:43,00:29:44,side.
00:29:44,00:29:45,- Wow!
00:29:45,00:29:46,Oh my God.
00:29:46,00:29:51,"'Cause it's tiny, imagine being stuck there, it's like 2.5 square miles."
00:29:51,00:29:54,"- Yeah, it is tiny, isn't it, but a lot of it is rock."
00:29:54,00:29:57,"It is a lot rock, but when you say, I watched a video earlier, 'cause I thought, I wonder"
00:29:57,00:29:58,what it looks like.
00:29:58,00:30:02,"All the descriptions just talk about rocks and tunnels and caves and so on, and I thought,"
00:30:02,00:30:07,"okay, it must be quite barren, and actually, the high street looks very much like a high"
00:30:07,00:30:12,"street you'd get in the UK, there's McDonald's, there's shops everywhere, it's bustling."
00:30:12,00:30:18,"The issue is, it's so tiny, and there is so little flat surface on Gibraltar that you"
00:30:18,00:30:22,"know when you're sometimes going, driving on the road, and a train's coming, and you"
00:30:22,00:30:28,"have to stop because the train and sex are the road, the airport runway intersects with"
00:30:28,00:30:33,"their busiest main road, Winston Churchill Avenue, so they have to stop all the traffic"
00:30:33,00:30:38,"to let an easy jet plane land, and then they can start again."
00:30:38,00:30:42,"- Well, when they opened that bit of road, which was actually later, the Winston Churchill"
00:30:42,00:30:47,"Avenue bit, that was in 1985, 'cause even 1982, it was only the pedestrian border that"
00:30:47,00:30:51,"was open, they wouldn't let cars drive across, and there were loads of limitations on it."
00:30:51,00:30:56,"In 1985, they opened the road border, and I think they learned from the 1982 mistake,"
00:30:56,00:30:58,'cause they did a practice run.
00:30:58,00:31:02,"So early on in the day, they did a practice run, and it was a good thing because since"
00:31:02,00:31:08,"they'd shot it, the Spanish had laid two coats of tarmac on their side, and so the gate was"
00:31:08,00:31:11,completely jammed shut on their side.
00:31:11,00:31:13,- That's amazing.
00:31:13,00:31:17,- They had to get a pneumatic drill and a workman to remove it.
00:31:17,00:31:24,"- It's a really strange place, and I think it occupies a big space in the British imagination,"
00:31:24,00:31:26,because it was this big outpost of empire.
00:31:26,00:31:31,"It changed hands so many times, didn't it, between various different nations who were"
00:31:31,00:31:32,all claiming it.
00:31:32,00:31:37,"It's the site of the longest ever siege in British or English history, the great siege"
00:31:37,00:31:40,of Gibraltar went from 1779 to 1783.
00:31:40,00:31:45,"There were huge French and Spanish naval and land forces attacking about 30,000 troops"
00:31:45,00:31:50,"on that side, only about seven and a half thousand British troops, and they tried starving"
00:31:50,00:31:54,"the British troops out, launched these huge assaults, there were tourists watching the"
00:31:54,00:31:59,"final Franco-Spanish assault, who just assumed it was going to be a complete walkover."
00:31:59,00:32:03,"Everyone applauded as the French and Spanish took their places to start the bombardment,"
00:32:03,00:32:07,"and yet it withstood that, so it occupied this big space in the imperial imagination,"
00:32:07,00:32:08,I guess.
00:32:08,00:32:14,"- As we said, this place, Gibraltar, has just constantly been under siege, there's always"
00:32:14,00:32:20,"been attempts to take it over and shift the ownership around, and one of those times was"
00:32:20,00:32:26,"in World War II, and this was a point where Winston Churchill had his eye on Gibraltar"
00:32:26,00:32:31,"and wanted to make sure that we as the Brits kept hold of it, and one of the things that"
00:32:31,00:32:38,"happened is that there's an old superstition, in Gibraltar, for the British, that if the"
00:32:38,00:32:44,"Barbary apes that live there left, kind of like how if the ravens left the Tower of London,"
00:32:44,00:32:50,"Britain's rain over it would fall, so Winston Churchill made a specific request to make"
00:32:50,00:32:57,"sure there were always 24 of these Barbary apes on the island, even shipping some over"
00:32:57,00:32:58,to make sure that they had this.
00:32:58,00:33:04,"So I read this on WinstonChurchill.org, and he sent a directive to the Colonial Secretary"
00:33:04,00:33:09,saying the establishment of the apes on Gibraltar should be 24 and every effort should be made
00:33:09,00:33:14,"to reach this number as soon as possible and maintain it thereafter, and as a result of"
00:33:14,00:33:19,"this directive, the army appointed a non-commissioned officer who is the officer in charge of the"
00:33:19,00:33:25,"apes, and they had to just make sure that the apes were looked after, they were maintained."
00:33:25,00:33:30,It was a role that was held by a guy called Sergeant Alfred Holmes for 38 years.
00:33:30,00:33:35,"No way, he must have just thought this is a relatively easy army post, no one is shooting"
00:33:35,00:33:40,"at me, I just have to make sure none of the apes die, kept on pretending oh no it's actually"
00:33:40,00:33:43,"very difficult to get them to breed, I'm really struggling here."
00:33:43,00:33:46,Do you think he was in charge of making them breed?
00:33:46,00:33:48,It sounds like he was in charge of bringing up their numbers.
00:33:48,00:33:52,Mostly bringing them in from another country rather than making them shug each other I
00:33:52,00:33:53,think.
00:33:53,00:33:56,"Look, I don't know why he did for those 38 years."
00:33:56,00:34:00,"But you've got to say, I don't know, there was a lot of resources being stretched in"
00:34:00,00:34:06,a lot of ways during WWII and was shipping 20 monkeys from Africa to Gibraltar really
00:34:06,00:34:08,the best use of our time and effort.
00:34:08,00:34:12,"There was a big plan to invade wasn't there, it was called Operation Felix, the German"
00:34:12,00:34:15,"plan to invade, but there was a big turf war between Hitler and Franco, Franco said no"
00:34:15,00:34:21,"I only want Spain to invade and Spain was technically neutral, although it was the most"
00:34:21,00:34:24,Nazi neutral country you could possibly imagine it was literally a fascist country.
00:34:24,00:34:29,"And so Franco decided to stay neutral, but everyone thought it would be incredibly easy."
00:34:29,00:34:33,An aide to the governor thought it was impregnable as a poached egg and the Spanish thought it
00:34:33,00:34:37,would take literally 20 minutes to invade if they ever actually bothered.
00:34:37,00:34:40,How overcooked is this guy's poached eggs?
00:34:40,00:34:43,I think the point is that it's not impregnable right?
00:34:43,00:34:44,"Right, sorry."
00:34:44,00:34:48,So like a poached egg it will just fall apart as soon as you pierce it.
00:34:48,00:34:49,Exactly.
00:34:49,00:34:51,James has understood the metaphor there.
00:34:51,00:34:56,"I was saying there's no way we can get in, that makes a lot of sense because it does"
00:34:56,00:34:57,feel like the Nazis missed a trick.
00:34:57,00:35:01,"It's a piece of piss to get to, it's really small, it's the entrance to the Mediterranean,"
00:35:01,00:35:06,"I don't know if we've said for any sort of confused American listeners, it's not just"
00:35:06,00:35:11,"a random place, or any other country you might not know where Gibraltar is, just because"
00:35:11,00:35:15,America's quite far away.
00:35:15,00:35:18,"Only Anna America's a continent, not a country, I think you mean USA people, just to correct"
00:35:18,00:35:19,you on your geography there.
00:35:19,00:35:24,"Look, I was just trying to help, and I know I've got in trouble now."
00:35:24,00:35:27,"So yeah, it's really important, why didn't you go for it?"
00:35:27,00:35:32,"Because wasn't there a plan, because like an egg has lots of holes, tiny, tiny holes"
00:35:32,00:35:35,in it so that the chick can breathe on the inside.
00:35:35,00:35:39,"The Rock of Gibraltar has lots of little holes and caves, and wasn't there a thing where"
00:35:39,00:35:42,we put some soldiers inside one of those holes?
00:35:42,00:35:44,"Yes, there was."
00:35:44,00:35:50,"There was a cave which was set up so that if the island was overrun, a crew of six soldiers"
00:35:50,00:35:54,"only could stay behind, spy on the enemy movements and then report back."
00:35:54,00:35:59,"So they had a year's food and water, I don't know what happens after the year is up."
00:35:59,00:36:03,"They had exercise bikes, which I love, and that was going to power the generator they"
00:36:03,00:36:07,"used, I guess to run the radio and stay in contact with Britain."
00:36:07,00:36:11,"But what a situation that would have been for those six left behind, the only troops"
00:36:11,00:36:12,not discovered.
00:36:12,00:36:13,"It's amazing, isn't it?"
00:36:13,00:36:14,That is awesome.
00:36:14,00:36:16,"The idea was that if one of them died, they couldn't take them out, because that would"
00:36:16,00:36:21,"tell everyone where they were, so they were going to bury them underneath the floor in"
00:36:21,00:36:24,"one of these caves, and that was the official plan."
00:36:24,00:36:25,Oh my God.
00:36:25,00:36:26,Really?
00:36:26,00:36:28,"Well, you can't put the formaldehyde on, because then you'll use up your food supplies quicker"
00:36:28,00:36:29,than you want.
00:36:29,00:36:37,"Wow, that feels like it must have been the seven worst people in the British Army."
00:36:37,00:36:40,"The guy who's guarding the apes and the six people they shove in the caves on Gibraltar,"
00:36:40,00:36:44,"they're like, we've got to do something with these guys."
00:36:44,00:36:50,"Just to go back quickly to the blockade of Gibraltar by Spain, it was quite interesting"
00:36:50,00:36:56,"because before that happened, before the Second World War, basically, Gibraltar was sort of"
00:36:56,00:36:59,"Spanish in character, even though it was British territory."
00:36:59,00:37:04,"Everyone spoke Spanish, it was Spanish culture, Spanish families, you know, you'd have one"
00:37:04,00:37:09,"half of your family on one side, the other half on the other, it was almost indistinguishable,"
00:37:09,00:37:13,and what one of these guys who I was listening to an interview with was saying was that the
00:37:13,00:37:17,"blockade hardened Gibraltarian's attitudes, so it did complete the opposite of what Franco"
00:37:17,00:37:22,"wanted because he shut the border, and suddenly everyone in Gibraltar went, well, screw you"
00:37:22,00:37:23,then.
00:37:23,00:37:26,"And they did really well, and obviously they've got this access to the Mediterranean, and"
00:37:26,00:37:32,"they had all this food imported, and so before the war, I think a third of marriages were"
00:37:32,00:37:35,intermarriages between Spanish and Gibraltarians.
00:37:35,00:37:40,"Everyone spoke Spanish, like I say, now most people in Gibraltar don't even speak Spanish,"
00:37:40,00:37:45,"so you don't grow up speaking Spanish, and there's no intermarriage, they have completely"
00:37:45,00:37:49,"turned against Spain, so shot myself in the foot."
00:37:49,00:37:53,"And the keys have been quite a historical thing, haven't they, in Gibraltar, because"
00:37:53,00:37:58,"over history, especially in like the 17th, 18th, 19th centuries, they only had a certain"
00:37:58,00:38:02,"number of doors that you could get into the country with, and they had special keys that"
00:38:02,00:38:06,"they would lock it up every night, and they would have the ceremony of the keys like they"
00:38:06,00:38:08,do in the Tower of London.
00:38:08,00:38:09,Did they?
00:38:09,00:38:10,Right.
00:38:10,00:38:11,Yeah.
00:38:11,00:38:15,"And during the Great Siege, which Andy was talking about, the governor who's called General"
00:38:15,00:38:20,"Sir George Augustus Elliott, apparently he would have the one set of keys, and he would"
00:38:20,00:38:22,carry them everywhere he went.
00:38:22,00:38:26,"No matter where he went, he always had this set of keys on him, and it was rumoured, according"
00:38:26,00:38:31,"to the website I read, it was rumoured that he slept with them under his pillow at night."
00:38:31,00:38:35,"They're massive keys, that must be a rumour, because it would be an incredibly uncomfortable"
00:38:35,00:38:38,night's sleep for you to put.
00:38:38,00:38:42,"I could just about put my house keys under my pillow, because I don't live in a medieval"
00:38:42,00:38:43,fortress.
00:38:43,00:38:45,Do you put your keys under your pillow when you go to bed?
00:38:45,00:38:50,"I'm just saying I could, I'm not telling you where I keep my keys, I've tried James."
00:38:50,00:38:57,I was just thinking you might get robbed by the Tooth Fairy.
00:38:57,00:38:59,Freaky weird Tooth Fairy this guy has.
00:38:59,00:39:09,"Every morning I wake up with a quid, which then goes straight to Timbson's cutting another"
00:39:09,00:39:10,set.
00:39:10,00:39:15,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Andy."
00:39:15,00:39:21,"My fact is that Aristotle's masterpiece was written more than 2,000 years after Aristotle"
00:39:21,00:39:22,died.
00:39:22,00:39:23,Wow.
00:39:23,00:39:25,"Yeah, a late bloomer."
00:39:25,00:39:30,How much formaldehyde did he apply to his body to stay quite that active?
00:39:30,00:39:34,"This is a 17th century book, Aristotle's Masterpiece."
00:39:34,00:39:42,"It's a sex manual in a way, it's also a pregnancy manual, childbirth manual, all sorts of facts"
00:39:42,00:39:49,"about human reproduction and generation and all of this, and it's got nothing to do with"
00:39:49,00:39:50,Aristotle.
00:39:50,00:39:57,"It's completely bogus as a title, but it was popular to put Aristotle in the title"
00:39:57,00:40:03,of your book because it was a pseudonym that got used often for sex books because it was
00:40:03,00:40:08,"kind of known that he'd written a bit about reproduction, and so if you put Aristotle"
00:40:08,00:40:11,"in the title of a book, that made it quite sexy."
00:40:11,00:40:13,"Was it like people actually thought it was by Aristotle, right?"
00:40:13,00:40:16,"It wasn't like it was just the title, it was kind of claiming to be by him."
00:40:16,00:40:20,"I don't think, it did claim, but I don't think anyone seriously thought it was by him, apart"
00:40:20,00:40:25,"from anything, it kept getting updated every year, and most people knew that he'd been"
00:40:25,00:40:29,"dead for quite a long time, so I don't think anyone really thought it was by him."
00:40:29,00:40:34,"But yeah, like you say, Aristotle was like a reference for sex, basically."
00:40:34,00:40:38,"There are a lot of plays where people use the word ""Aristotle"" to mean ""sexy times"","
00:40:38,00:40:39,yeah.
00:40:39,00:40:40,But of how's your father?
00:40:40,00:40:41,Yeah.
00:40:41,00:40:46,"Because it was published in 1684, and it was immediately a massive success."
00:40:46,00:40:50,"It was pirated immediately as well, despite the fact that they tried to copyright it and"
00:40:50,00:40:54,"say ""official publisher"" was releasing the book."
00:40:54,00:41:01,"But it was reprinted all the way up until the 1930s, and in the middle of the 18th century,"
00:41:01,00:41:05,"there were more editions of this in circulation, this book, than all of the other works that"
00:41:05,00:41:07,were on reproduction combined.
00:41:07,00:41:08,Whoa.
00:41:08,00:41:09,It's insane.
00:41:09,00:41:10,What does that mean?
00:41:10,00:41:12,"I saw that written down, but I couldn't work out what it meant."
00:41:12,00:41:16,It'd be the equivalent of what to expect when you're expecting outselling all the other
00:41:16,00:41:18,books on the subject combined together.
00:41:18,00:41:21,They still had more in circulation.
00:41:21,00:41:29,"And Aristotle had this real rep for being sexy, so the book Aristotle's Problems was"
00:41:29,00:41:33,"published in 1595, which sounds like a fun agony uncle book."
00:41:33,00:41:38,"It was mostly, you know, lots of Q&As about sex and reproduction, so questions including"
00:41:38,00:41:45,"what is carnal copulation and how are hermaphrodites begotten, and other really important stuff"
00:41:45,00:41:46,that you needed to know.
00:41:46,00:41:50,"It was exactly the format of the book that we've released this year, Funny You Should"
00:41:50,00:41:51,Ask.
00:41:51,00:41:55,"Exactly the format, but quite a different content, wasn't it?"
00:41:55,00:41:57,"No, I was reading it."
00:41:57,00:41:58,Sexy You Should Ask.
00:41:58,00:42:01,I was reading it and looking at the number of questions that are the same in that as
00:42:01,00:42:03,"Funny You Should Ask, and there are quite a few."
00:42:03,00:42:07,"It's probably like, it made me think, how great that humans have been curious about the same"
00:42:07,00:42:09,shit for so long.
00:42:09,00:42:13,We didn't have how our hermaphrodites begotten.
00:42:13,00:42:14,"Okay, absolutely."
00:42:14,00:42:17,"I did try to get that one in, and not acceptable."
00:42:17,00:42:23,"There are a few sort of areas that we didn't cover, but like, why do we sneeze?"
00:42:23,00:42:25,Why do you have only one mouth but two eyes?
00:42:25,00:42:27,Why is spit white?
00:42:27,00:42:30,Why do we like sweet taste so much more than others?
00:42:30,00:42:34,Why do men and women get ticklish when you tickle their armpits but nothing else?
00:42:34,00:42:40,"I really thought, this guy's, whoever wrote this, not Aristotle, is a man after her own"
00:42:40,00:42:41,heart.
00:42:41,00:42:42,Pseudo-Aristotle.
00:42:42,00:42:43,Yeah.
00:42:43,00:42:46,"That was, this is a whole field of study, is books that claim to be by Aristotle but"
00:42:46,00:42:52,"are manifestly not, and the author, the collective author of those is known as Pseudo-Aristotle,"
00:42:52,00:42:53,which I love.
00:42:53,00:42:56,"Basically, everyone had a copy of this Aristotle's masterpiece, didn't they?"
00:42:56,00:42:58,"They were really, really popular."
00:42:58,00:43:03,"I was chatting to Ross McFarlane, who works at the Welcome Library, and they have quite"
00:43:03,00:43:09,"a few copies of this book there, and the ones that they have are quite small, they're printed"
00:43:09,00:43:14,"on very cheap paper, you can tell that they're things that were mass produced and that people"
00:43:14,00:43:15,would just own.
00:43:15,00:43:20,"And one thing that would happen is sometimes, as they get towards the end of a page, the"
00:43:20,00:43:24,font would get smaller and smaller and smaller so that they didn't have to have another page
00:43:24,00:43:30,"at the end of it, and you would see often people would write things in them."
00:43:30,00:43:34,"So there was one where they recorded all the births of their children, for instance, in"
00:43:34,00:43:36,there and stuff like that.
00:43:36,00:43:38,"So yeah, it was, they were very quotidian."
00:43:38,00:43:39,That's such a good idea.
00:43:39,00:43:40,Yeah.
00:43:40,00:43:46,"I can see successfully with Brian doing this, this one didn't work, tried it 12 times."
00:43:46,00:43:49,"Because there were these rules all the way through, which are obviously loads of them"
00:43:49,00:43:53,"are complete horlicks, you know, that male children sit on the right hand side of the"
00:43:53,00:43:57,"womb and girls sit on the left, not true."
00:43:57,00:44:00,"If you want to test whether your child is a boy or a girl, drop a drop of milk into"
00:44:00,00:44:02,a basin of water.
00:44:02,00:44:05,"And if the milk sinks to the bottom intact, it's a girl."
00:44:05,00:44:07,"If it spreads out and disperses, it's a boy."
00:44:07,00:44:08,That's not true.
00:44:08,00:44:10,You'll be amazed to hear.
00:44:10,00:44:14,"Like it's, I can't believe that this book survived until 1930s because a lot of it is"
00:44:14,00:44:15,just pure baloney.
00:44:15,00:44:16,Yeah.
00:44:16,00:44:18,But it's entertaining baloney.
00:44:18,00:44:20,"If it's entertaining, you'll read it, right?"
00:44:20,00:44:21,That's true.
00:44:21,00:44:22,And it's sexy baloney.
00:44:22,00:44:23,Sexy baloney.
00:44:23,00:44:24,Yeah.
00:44:24,00:44:30,"But with what James is saying about writing down the children and their birth dates, there's"
00:44:30,00:44:36,been a few cases where the book has been useful to prove things for people who've lost documentation.
00:44:36,00:44:41,"So this book made it over to America and in 1832, in Tennessee, there was a guy called"
00:44:41,00:44:46,Edward Weart who was trying to get a pension in connection to his military service in the
00:44:46,00:44:50,"Revolutionary War, but he had lost his discharge papers."
00:44:50,00:44:53,"And so he needed to prove his age, but he had no way of proving his age."
00:44:53,00:44:59,"And what the court records as his submission of proof was that this book, Aristotle's"
00:44:59,00:45:03,"Masterpiece, was brought in by him and it had in it his birth date as recorded by his"
00:45:03,00:45:05,parents in it.
00:45:05,00:45:09,"And they, that persuaded the court that he was born when he said he was born so he could"
00:45:09,00:45:10,get the pension.
00:45:10,00:45:12,"Sorry, why were people recording his birthday in the book?"
00:45:12,00:45:16,"Well, that was a thing parents used to write stuff all in the book."
00:45:16,00:45:21,"So you would, you would record your children's birth dates in it because it just was a, it"
00:45:21,00:45:22,was a place to put it.
00:45:22,00:45:23,It was a reproduction book.
00:45:23,00:45:25,Why not mark it down there?
00:45:25,00:45:30,"You could say that, you know, he didn't have his discharge papers, but that he had his"
00:45:30,00:45:32,parents discharge papers.
00:45:32,00:45:33,Oh dear.
00:45:33,00:45:36,"And that's a joke about his conception because obviously it's, um,"
00:45:36,00:45:38,"Do you have discharge papers, Andy?"
00:45:38,00:45:39,"Is that what, what is it like?"
00:45:39,00:45:41,What are you like in the bedroom?
00:45:41,00:45:48,There's a lot of paperwork.
00:45:48,00:45:52,It's almost feels like some of that stuff is a lot better than actual Aristotle was
00:45:52,00:45:53,"writing, right?"
00:45:53,00:45:58,"Because Aristotle, well, he was a genius for his time."
00:45:58,00:46:03,"I think it's fair to say he got quite a lot of things wrong, but he did get a lot of things"
00:46:03,00:46:05,wrong about women in his writings.
00:46:05,00:46:12,He thought that blonde women were better at getting orgasms than non-blonde women.
00:46:12,00:46:15,And that the orgasm was very important for conception.
00:46:15,00:46:20,So he thought that blonde women would be able to conceive better than non-blonde women.
00:46:20,00:46:25,He thought that women's discharge was very important for procreation.
00:46:25,00:46:29,"And so he spent a lot of time, according to the article I read, trying to separate out"
00:46:29,00:46:32,female fluids.
00:46:32,00:46:36,"And he thought that if women ate pungent foods like garlic or peppers, they would be able"
00:46:36,00:46:38,to conceive better.
00:46:38,00:46:42,I found it's definitely a hindrance rather than a hell.
00:46:42,00:46:46,He thought that women had fewer teeth than men.
00:46:46,00:46:48,"Look, that is just a fact, James."
00:46:48,00:46:52,You can't argue with nature like that.
00:46:52,00:46:57,"And he thought that women are more mischievous, less simple, more impulsive, more compassionate,"
00:46:57,00:47:01,"more easily moved to tears, more jealous, more crerulous, more apt to scold and strike,"
00:47:01,00:47:06,"more prone to despondency, less hopeful, more void of shame or self-respect, more false"
00:47:06,00:47:11,"of speech, more deceptive, more retentive of memory, more wakeful, more shrinking and"
00:47:11,00:47:13,more difficult to rouse to action than men.
00:47:13,00:47:14,OK.
00:47:14,00:47:15,More shrinking?
00:47:15,00:47:20,"I mean, there was a lot of wrong stuff in there, and it's quite strange that that's"
00:47:20,00:47:21,weird.
00:47:21,00:47:25,"Because there are a few things in there that you're like, oh, yeah, yeah."
00:47:25,00:47:28,"And it's got to, it's a whole melange of compliments and insults."
00:47:28,00:47:31,"It would be hard to know how to take that list, wouldn't it, if it came at you with"
00:47:31,00:47:32,her?
00:47:32,00:47:36,"I think probably best not to say that women are like X and men are like Y in general,"
00:47:36,00:47:38,"perhaps, even if some of them are compliments."
00:47:38,00:47:39,Let's just not say that.
00:47:39,00:47:40,I'll take the compliments.
00:47:40,00:47:41,Fuck it.
00:47:41,00:47:43,You take what you can get.
00:47:43,00:47:44,But is it possible?
00:47:44,00:47:46,"I mean, this guy was slightly clever, wasn't he?"
00:47:46,00:47:48,It was kind of a big deal.
00:47:48,00:47:55,Is it possible that back in the day women just did have less teeth?
00:47:55,00:48:01,"I read a really good article of, there was a guy called H. L. Levy who was trying to"
00:48:01,00:48:07,rescue Aristotle's reputation for misogynism because everyone thinks that he's misogynistic.
00:48:07,00:48:11,"And he basically said, well, maybe it's not that he was misogynistic."
00:48:11,00:48:16,He just got all these things wrong about women because he got quite a lot wrong about everything.
00:48:16,00:48:17,Yeah.
00:48:17,00:48:18,Right.
00:48:18,00:48:19,Because he did quite get quite a lot wrong.
00:48:19,00:48:21,"He must have got stuff wrong about men as well, right, presumably."
00:48:21,00:48:22,Yeah.
00:48:22,00:48:28,I think he said that men with bigger penises would be less good at fertilizing women because
00:48:28,00:48:33,that gives the sperm more time to get cold on their way over.
00:48:33,00:48:38,"That does sound like something he said on a one night stand, doesn't it?"
00:48:38,00:48:43,"I think that makes sense because I've successfully had two children and it's not about the size,"
00:48:43,00:48:44,guys.
00:48:44,00:48:51,"I feel like we should say that also Aristotle, unlike some of the more fun, but more wild"
00:48:51,00:48:55,"ancients that we talk about, is still discussed today extensively in philosophy."
00:48:55,00:49:00,He's one of the great philosophical pillars and his idea that everything is in balance.
00:49:00,00:49:06,So the idea of a virtue is the exact equidistant between two extremes of vice.
00:49:06,00:49:10,"Things like that are still discussed a lot, so let's give the guy some credit."
00:49:10,00:49:11,He was a bit sexist.
00:49:11,00:49:14,"He believed some crazy stuff, but he was a great philosopher."
00:49:14,00:49:18,"Thought that the oryx, which is the thing which turned into cows, thought that they"
00:49:18,00:49:24,projectile pood 1.8 meters away from their bums and that the poos burned like fire to
00:49:24,00:49:27,get rid of predators.
00:49:27,00:49:29,It's not completely implausible.
00:49:29,00:49:30,Yeah.
00:49:30,00:49:35,"He thought that an earthquake, he thought that the tremor of an earthquake was either"
00:49:35,00:49:39,"the earth farting, or you know that shiver when you pee sometimes."
00:49:39,00:49:43,He thought it was the earth's equivalent of that kind of shivering pee.
00:49:43,00:49:46,"Sorry, what's the shiver when you pee?"
00:49:46,00:49:49,"It's not a thing that everyone gets, but it's a relatively common thing that some people"
00:49:49,00:49:52,like get a shiver down the back of their neck when they urinate.
00:49:52,00:49:53,Do they?
00:49:53,00:49:54,Wow.
00:49:54,00:49:55,Okay.
00:49:55,00:49:56,Sounds like someone else is urinating onto them.
00:49:56,00:50:01,I should be even reading the wrong texts.
00:50:01,00:50:04,"Like that saying, don't piss up my back and tell me it's raining, right?"
00:50:04,00:50:05,Yeah.
00:50:05,00:50:12,"And he thought eels spontaneously generated from mud, but as we've said before, eels is"
00:50:12,00:50:13,a tough one.
00:50:13,00:50:14,Yeah.
00:50:14,00:50:15,Eels is a really tough one.
00:50:15,00:50:16,Yes.
00:50:16,00:50:17,Yes.
00:50:17,00:50:19,Another one in this constant wrangle with me trying to defend this obviously very ancient
00:50:19,00:50:24,sexist but who was a genius is the eels thing is evidence that he was an empiricist.
00:50:24,00:50:28,"And that was amazing at the time where his tutor, Plato and everyone else would just like come"
00:50:28,00:50:32,up with theories and then we'll say they're true because they make sense.
00:50:32,00:50:36,"And Aristotle said, should we actually look at what some stuff that's happening and start"
00:50:36,00:50:37,describing it instead?
00:50:37,00:50:38,"So, yeah."
00:50:38,00:50:42,"And then he went to eels and said, well, they don't have any genitals, which to be fair,"
00:50:42,00:50:48,"we thought for another 2000 years, you say, but that didn't stop Dan from having two children."
00:50:48,00:50:50,"So Dan's paperwork was all in order, though."
00:50:50,00:50:56,It's mostly about paperwork I find in the bedroom.
00:50:56,00:51:01,"There were things which, and again, this is the counterweight to all the absolutely true"
00:51:01,00:51:06,"stuff James has just said is so, for example, he observed that hairs can become doubly pregnant,"
00:51:06,00:51:09,which wasn't believed to be true for centuries after him.
00:51:09,00:51:14,"You know, hairs can become pregnant while already pregnant, as it were, they can do"
00:51:14,00:51:15,that again.
00:51:15,00:51:18,He did think that elephants couldn't bend their knees and that they always had to sleep
00:51:18,00:51:20,upright because they couldn't bend their knees.
00:51:20,00:51:25,"This is a grudge match between James on one side, Anna and Andy on the other saying Aristotle"
00:51:25,00:51:27,was an idiot or a genius.
00:51:27,00:51:29,"This is the thing I'm not sure about though, Anna, because I thought that he didn't do"
00:51:29,00:51:35,"actual experiments as in he was an empiricist, but he didn't, he didn't do the scientific"
00:51:35,00:51:39,"method to that extent, but he gathered a huge amount of data and then kind of extrapolated"
00:51:39,00:51:43,"an inferred based on that, which is still obviously a massive step forward from just"
00:51:43,00:51:45,saying any old stuff.
00:51:45,00:51:50,"And it was an attempt to categorize and sort things, which also obviously is a massive"
00:51:50,00:51:51,cognitive leap forward.
00:51:51,00:51:57,"So he divided animals into 11 grades from highest, lowest, highest, unsurprisingly humans."
00:51:57,00:52:02,"And he said, you know, the best and the highest animals in nature are the ones that give live"
00:52:02,00:52:09,"birth to hot and wet creatures and that the worst animals, the lowest grade of nature"
00:52:09,00:52:10,lay eggs.
00:52:10,00:52:14,"They don't give birth to the live young and those are cold, dry eggs and that those are"
00:52:14,00:52:15,the worst.
00:52:15,00:52:16,So I imagine chickens.
00:52:16,00:52:18,"No, chickens warm, aren't they?"
00:52:18,00:52:19,Chickens eggs are warm.
00:52:19,00:52:21,So I suppose like lizards.
00:52:21,00:52:22,Yeah.
00:52:22,00:52:23,I think it must be something.
00:52:23,00:52:24,Lizard is something reptilian.
00:52:24,00:52:30,"I really love just thinking about how he was, you know, co-opted by all these people over"
00:52:30,00:52:33,"the years, how he still is co-opted today."
00:52:33,00:52:37,"And if you look up Aristotle and look up articles that have been written about him,"
00:52:37,00:52:40,they'll just apply his philosophy to everything.
00:52:40,00:52:44,"So how Aristotle is the perfect happiness guru, guardian article."
00:52:44,00:52:47,"Should we cancel Aristotle, New York Times article?"
00:52:47,00:52:48,Sure.
00:52:48,00:52:49,"It is, it is useful."
00:52:49,00:52:53,"That thing that you said, Anna, about every virtue being a tightrope between two alternating"
00:52:53,00:52:54,vices.
00:52:54,00:52:55,That is quite a clever idea.
00:52:55,00:53:00,"So the idea is, for example, that bravery is a tightrope between cowardice on the one"
00:53:00,00:53:05,hand and being completely foolhardy on the other side between those two is the golden
00:53:05,00:53:11,"virtue, the golden mean of being brave when necessary."
00:53:11,00:53:16,"Part of that theory was that basically everything that is extant kind of fits in its own niche,"
00:53:16,00:53:17,right?
00:53:17,00:53:20,And that there wasn't a beginning to the universe and there isn't going to be an end to the
00:53:20,00:53:21,universe.
00:53:21,00:53:26,Everything just existed and the worms are where they should be and Aristotle's where
00:53:26,00:53:28,"he should be and everything's, you know."
00:53:28,00:53:29,Yeah.
00:53:29,00:53:36,It was also an attempt to justify the social structure of Greek city-states vis-a-vis slavery
00:53:36,00:53:42,"and yeah, it was a justifying, it's just the way things are, guys, was kind of how you"
00:53:42,00:53:44,could simplify his possession too.
00:53:44,00:53:49,I don't want a worm revolution any more than he does.
00:53:49,00:53:54,"So the Aristotle's problems that you were talking about before, which Anna said is basically"
00:53:54,00:54:00,"the same as funny you should ask, each chapter begins with a poem and I wonder if we should"
00:54:00,00:54:03,bring that for the next funny you should ask book.
00:54:03,00:54:04,Well.
00:54:04,00:54:05,We should start each chapter with a poem.
00:54:05,00:54:06,Watch this space.
00:54:06,00:54:07,Yeah.
00:54:07,00:54:12,"So for instance, this is one of the chapters, ""Thus man's most noble parts described we"
00:54:12,00:54:19,"see, for such the parts of generation be, are they that carefully surveyed will find,"
00:54:19,00:54:25,"each part is fitted for the use designed, the purest blood we find, if well we heed,"
00:54:25,00:54:28,"is in the testicles turned into seed."""
00:54:28,00:54:31,Do you think that might work for our next QI poem?
00:54:31,00:54:32,That's absolutely beautiful.
00:54:32,00:54:33,I think not.
00:54:33,00:54:34,That's static.
00:54:34,00:54:37,"Testicles does stick out a bit there in the poem, doesn't it?"
00:54:37,00:54:39,"It's difficult, isn't it, because the poem is about testicles."
00:54:39,00:54:40,Yeah.
00:54:40,00:54:41,So you do need testicles.
00:54:41,00:54:44,It's like Wordsworth's Daffodils poem.
00:54:44,00:54:49,"The word Daffodil really sticks out in that poem, I have to say, but it's about Daffodils,"
00:54:49,00:54:50,so you do.
00:54:50,00:54:51,Memorable.
00:54:51,00:54:52,Yeah.
00:54:52,00:54:53,Yeah.
00:54:53,00:54:54,Memorable.
00:54:54,00:54:55,I didn't see the testicles coming.
00:54:55,00:54:56,That felt like a twist to me.
00:54:56,00:54:57,"Oh, don't twist the testicles."
00:54:57,00:55:00,"Well, if you do, you won't see them coming."
00:55:00,00:55:05,"Okay, that's it."
00:55:05,00:55:06,That is all of our facts.
