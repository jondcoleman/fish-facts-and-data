00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.040
 "Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.880
 to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.280
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.800
 and James Harkin and once again we have gathered round the microphones with our four favourite

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.800
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.960
 Starting with fact number one and that is James."

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.520
 "Okay, my fact this week is that Cheryl Tweedy is the only member of Girls Allowed who doesn't

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.640
 share her name with a type of potato."

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.000
 "And is that deliberate?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.160
 Is that a snub from the potato community?"

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.520
 "I think perhaps not, I think it's just a coincidence in the world.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.920
 In fact it's not even a coincidence because one of them doesn't share their name with

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.080
 a potato.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.080
 If they all share names with potatoes that would be an incredible coincidence but as

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.200
 it happens one of them doesn't."

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.560
 "I've not seen this come up anywhere on the internet James, this is not from Oh My God

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.560
 Facts right?

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.560
 What is this?"

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.440
 "This is from my weird brain so I was reading an article about potatoes and I noticed there

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.040
 was a banana potato and an almond potato and I thought that was kind of weird.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.000
 I wonder if there's lots of other foodstuffs that are actually potatoes and so I found

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.360
 a list on Wikipedia of potatoes that started working my way down it and I found one called

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.720
 Nadine and I remembered that there was someone called Nadine in Girls Allowed so I thought

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.580
 I wonder if there's other potatoes named after people from Girls Allowed.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.640
 So I found a website with all the world's potatoes on it and searched all the names

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:55.800
 and there's a Kimberley and a Nicola and there is Maria Sarah so Sarah is in that name which

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.880
 I think counts because especially because Sarah, well Sarah Harding's mother is called

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.400
 Marie so that's like a..."

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.240
 "We're not going for the mums of the members of Girls Allowed?"

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.520
 "Well it's an even more of a slam that Cheryl doesn't get one.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.160
 They're heading into mum territory and not giving Cheryl."

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.160
 "Yeah that's true.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.840
 Sarah's got hers and her mums, yeah."

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.320
 "There is a Cherie potato so that's quite close but yeah I'm not really trying to say

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.240
 anything important about the world here just there's a lot of types of potatoes and there's

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.120
 a few members of Girls Allowed and they kind of some of the names overlap but I think it's

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.360
 made because there's lots of potatoes that are named after women so there's like Annabelle,

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:40.160
 Anya, Augusta, Barbara, Cara, Charlotte, Desiree, Juliet, Linda, I mean that's just me listing

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.160
 names of potatoes now so yeah."

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.560
 "There's an Anna potato."

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.560
 "Is there?"

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:52.200
 "Yes but there isn't, Dan, James or Anandie so Anna is the Cheryl Tweedy of no such thing

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.200
 as a fish."

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.200
 "She's a reverse Tweedy."

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.200
 "Reversed Tweedy, yeah."

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.200
 "You're the Cheryl."

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.280
 "No, no, no, she's the Cheryl in that her position in relation to potato naming is unique

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.600
 among the members of no such thing as a fish."

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:11.760
 "James, I'm just curious was this the agriculture and horticulture development board ahdb.org.uk

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.640
 website that you got your potato names on?"

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.000
 "No it wasn't actually, is that where you got your potato names from?"

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.840
 "Certainly is and I mean I don't know if this is a comprehensive list, I suspect it's not

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:31.880
 because there are thousands of potato varieties but there are romantic ones so there's Excalibur,

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:38.000
 Lionheart, Mayan Twilight, Mulan Rouge is the kind of potato so these are all the kind

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 of sexy ones.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.760
 There is also- "In what way outside of their name are they sexy, Anandie?"

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.240
 "Just in their name, literally just in their name but they don't have shapes that are sort

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.760
 of ooh that's a hot potato.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.280
 The Amorosa hot potato is not shaped like something especially sexual, no."

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.080
 "But I do hope that on the back of this podcast you've changed the meaning of the phrase hot

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.920
 potato to just literally mean a hot potato."

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:09.280
 "There is another Girls Allowed and Potato link which is the only one I've found and

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.920
 this is solely because of googling off the back of James's fact but Nadine from Girls

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.480
 Allowed is she Nadine Coyle?

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:23.000
 She loves or loved when they were doing their gigs to eat a potato before going on stage

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.040
 and in one of the interviews she did with the magazine she listed the top five ways

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.640
 she liked to eat a potato okay I'm just going to run these past you because this is important.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.400
 The top five ways Nadine Coyle likes to eat a potato are, see if you can spot the floor

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:46.600
 here, mashed, chips, roast, jacket, and new.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.880
 Now new is not a way of eating a potato, it's just a kind of potato.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.280
 "She means boiled potato, I call them new."

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.600
 "If you go to a restaurant and you order new potatoes with your steak you know what you're

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.560
 going to get, you're not going to get chips and they go 'oh actually you know you ordered

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.160
 new potatoes these are chipped new potatoes'."

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.280
 I think Andy's right, Nadine's clearly a potato connoisseur, she's going to be devastated

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.640
 when she hears this episode.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.320
 Our interviewer's just asking her questions about potatoes because she's Irish, that's

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.320
 why I like that.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.400
 "Good point, I think she must have brought it up first but she would have a potato before

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:29.480
 every show for a decade, whether in any of her five favorite methods or her four favorite

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.720
 methods and one favorite kind of potato."

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.320
 The restaurant central in Malima in Peru has 50 different ways to prepare potatoes.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.080
 "Have you read the list?"

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:48.360
 "No but I have been there, what kind of potato did you go for, inside out potato or something?"

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.680
 They kind of just give you what you get, it's like a menu but there was one dish that was

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.420
 just potatoes in lots of different ways, so like one of them was quite salty and one

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:01.200
 of them was bread made out of potato and one of them was something else.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:06.280
 "Cool, James did you visit the International Potato Center while you were there in Peru?"

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:11.200
 "You know what, I didn't, I was on holiday and even I will draw the line at dragging

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.760
 my wife to the International Potato Center."

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.760
 "You don't draw the line."

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:17.760
 "As is!"

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:18.760
 "That's well within your line."

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:19.960
 "You're just sitting there regretting it now."

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.200
 "Okay fine, I didn't know it was that."

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:28.360
 "The truth comes out, yeah there's an international potato center, I managed to find a slideshow

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:34.680
 of interesting potatoes that they have online and it was quite a journey going through the

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.680
 slides.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:41.400
 They have a potato that they like to show which is called the Yana Pina Potato and that's

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.680
 nicknamed the Weeping Bride.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:51.800
 The idea is that the potato needs to be peeled properly by a to-be-wife so that the mother-in-law

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.760
 can see that they've got the skills to peel the potatoes as such.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:01.880
 It's a very lumpy potato, if they can get past all of the bumps and the crevices it

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.920
 shows that they can navigate a potato.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:04.920
 That's interesting.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:08.920
 Peru takes its potatoes very seriously, they have got the International Potato Center.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.480
 Then they have occasional turf wars, don't they, with chili.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.520
 A lot of international potatoes, the really big hitters of the potato world, come from

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.800
 an island, I think it's Chiloé, which is off the coast of chili and potatoes are so

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:25.160
 popular there that some people will carry a potato in their pocket to ward off the spells

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.800
 of spiteful neighbours.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:34.760
 There was a guy called André Contreras-Mendes, he died in 2014, but his kind of lifetime's

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:42.120
 ambition was to go around Chiloé just trying to find unusual potatoes because in Chiloé

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:47.400
 you had a lot of people who kind of lived on their little homestead and you would have

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:52.480
 lots of elderly women who would look after the potatoes and then they would pass down

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:57.160
 the seeds of their potatoes to the next generation, to the next generation, to the next generation.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:01.120
 So if you didn't have someone going around kind of collecting the seeds and saving these

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:06.600
 types of potato, then when the generations died with the last old lady then the potatoes

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:07.600
 would two die.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.600
 Okay, very cool.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.480
 What kind of a name is Chiloé if it's part of chili?

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:17.920
 I mean they've literally just dropped a potato-shaped thing into the middle of the world.

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.920
 Seriously unimaginative day.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:20.920
 Yeah.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:21.920
 It's amazing.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:26.360
 Mr Potato Head has rebranded, big news this year.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.360
 Okay.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:32.280
 He's just Potato Head now, or in fact they are just Potato Head, to be more inclusive of

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:36.680
 the brand, because the Potato Head family is a whole family, I don't think I realise

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:37.680
 that.

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:38.680
 Yeah, have you not seen Toy Story?

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:42.960
 Oh my God, there's a Mrs Potato Head right there in Toy Story, isn't there?

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.680
 He just steals the attention so much.

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:48.920
 I think it was that the overall brand was called Mr Potato Head, now the overall brand

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:49.920
 is Potato Head.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:53.760
 And they made a big thing about saying, look you can still buy a Mr Potato Head within the

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.960
 family of Potato Head.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:56.960
 It was a really…

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:03.000
 It was one of the, it was a crazed media panic of the most predictable type.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.960
 Every headline saying Mr Potato Head's gone gender neutral and even though the press release

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:13.660
 it's gone out is, on every Mr Potato Head packet it says Mr Potato Head to make it clear

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:17.360
 that's who you're buying, they're just saying, look we can't call a whole brand

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:22.800
 Mr Potato Head, that's like my whole family just being named after my dad, actually I

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:26.640
 suppose that's what surname's on.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:31.520
 But like, you can really imagine that press release going through the entire company and

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:36.720
 everyone just going, this'll be fine won't it, no one's going to take offence to this.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:41.800
 You know, the biggest Mr Potato Head in history I guess you could say is a guy who we've

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:48.040
 mentioned once before, who's Antoine Augustin Parmentier, but he's the guy who rehabilitated

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.240
 potatoes in France.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:53.520
 They were seen as being incredibly dangerous, even though people were eating them in Germany

00:09:53.520 --> 00:10:01.280
 at that time, and he made them popular by this long PR campaign to get French people

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:07.120
 into potatoes, but it was partly because France was already looking for an excuse to eat potatoes

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:12.400
 if you like, because they had had failed grain harvests and things and there were big worries

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:18.520
 about this and there were prizes to identify alternative sources of nourishment, such a

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:21.440
 cool era when the government would just say there's a prize if you can think of anything

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:27.520
 we can eat, and he wrote an essay on potatoes and it won, and then he hung out with friend

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:32.260
 of the podcast, Benjamin Franklin, and was telling him all about these great things

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:36.640
 called potatoes, and then he ended up hosting a dinner, Parmentier, where everything was

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:37.640
 made of potatoes.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.720
 What, like the chairs, the table, the door, the house?

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.260
 Oh, God's sake.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:48.680
 Kind of like this restaurant James went to, everything on the plates was made of potatoes,

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:52.760
 so they served fish that was actually made of potatoes, and then they drank vodka, which

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.800
 was distilled from potatoes.

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.000
 That sounds like a very bland meal.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.560
 I don't know if salt was allowed or not, I think that's a big part of it, yeah.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.560
 Every bite is disappointing.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:07.320
 I agree with Anna, plot twist on every moment, the fork is made of potatoes, what, my plate

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:13.300
 is made of potatoes, the waiter is made of potatoes, a potato waiter, and then you look

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:19.840
 down at your own body and it's, I'm a potato.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:24.720
 Potatoes outside of Mr. Potato Head, as Anna was mentioning, being in the news, it has

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.400
 had quite a lot of press since the pandemic started.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:31.360
 I was looking just in, you know, news items to see where it's popped up.

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.200
 Quite a few headlines.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.560
 Woman accidentally turned herself into a potato for video meeting and couldn't figure out

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:37.680
 how to fix it.

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.600
 Do you remember that?

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:44.160
 She was, yeah, Lizette Ocampo was her name, political director at People for the American

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:50.320
 Way, and there was a filter on her Microsoft Teams app, which turned her into a potato.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:55.440
 She couldn't change it, had to do the entire meeting as a potato, a speaking potato.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:12:02.200
 Microsoft have developed a filter that knocks out potato chip noises from your conversation,

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.020
 this is another headline, when you're talking on Microsoft Teams.

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:07.680
 What noises potato chips make?

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:14.440
 So if you're, sorry, what I meant is if you're, crisps, exactly, so if you've got your hand

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:19.120
 in a bag of crisps and you're talking, it will knock out that noise because the AI has

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.040
 recognized that noise.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.040
 Yeah.

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:23.040
 So it kind of filters it out.

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:27.960
 So you can, you know, as everyone does, eat potato crisps during meetings.

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:30.240
 Stop calling them potato crisps or potato chips.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.240
 What do you mean?

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.240
 What are you doing?

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.240
 But they are crisps, right?

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.800
 Oh, Anna's about to strike a nationalist tone.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:38.280
 She's just saying, she's just like crisps, I think, is what she's about to say.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.280
 Just crisps.

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.280
 Just call them what we've always called them.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:41.280
 Okay.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.560
 I was just really trying to drill home the potato connection, even though obviously they're

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:46.720
 still connected without the word involved.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.240
 Oh, I like that you're helping the kids out.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.240
 Yeah.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.600
 I just want to make sure.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:57.360
 And then in 2020, last one that I found was the inaugural potato photographer of the year

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.360
 prize.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.360
 Oh, yeah.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:03.640
 That must be a hard job because they're quite hard to catch in the wild, aren't they?

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:06.640
 They're always hiding behind a bush.

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:07.640
 Exactly.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:08.640
 Nature's moles.

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:09.640
 Yeah.

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:10.640
 Yeah.

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:14.160
 It's an annual award that's happening every year now going forward a thousand pounds

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:19.920
 to the winner and you send in, yeah, you send in your picture of a potato that you've taken.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.280
 It's a very creative thing.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:26.840
 So the 2020 winner went down to a potato getting a lockdown haircut.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:30.960
 So it's obviously quite stylistic and artistic, a lot of these photos.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:35.120
 Some of the potatoes are actually potatoes in the wild or people planting potatoes or

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.200
 going through fields.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.200
 I would have gone for it.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:42.960
 Instead of a haircut, Dan, I would have gone for a Shakespeare King Lear, but with potatoes.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:47.800
 And you've got a potato Duke of Gloucester having its eyes removed because that's what

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.680
 happens in the play, spoiler alert.

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:53.160
 Oh, because potato, you call those things eyes on potatoes.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.160
 Yeah.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:55.160
 Exactly.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.120
 And in King Lear, the Duke of Gloucester is blinded.

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.120
 Okay.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:01.520
 Well, 2022 potato photographer of the year competition.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:02.520
 Here we come.

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:06.040
 Have you guys heard of the ketchup and chips plant?

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.040
 No.

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.040
 No.

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:09.040
 No.

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.040
 Is this an actual plant?

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:15.760
 You can buy from a company called Tom Tato and on the top above ground, it's a tomato

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:19.920
 plant and below ground, it's a potato plant.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:24.240
 So you can get from one plant, your chips and your ketchup.

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.240
 Amazing.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.240
 That's so good.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.520
 And when you say chips, James, sorry, can I just clarify what you mean?

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:29.520
 Potato chips.

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:30.520
 Sorry.

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:33.120
 Also not potato crisps.

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:34.440
 Can you speak of chips though?

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:38.640
 Can you guys guess what the egg and chips plant is that you can buy from the same company?

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:39.640
 Yeah.

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:40.640
 Egg and chips.

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:46.040
 It's a, oh, it's a chicken which lays a potato.

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:47.040
 Oh, beautiful.

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.640
 It's GM food gone mad.

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:52.400
 That would be great, but this is a plant.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.400
 Oh, okay.

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:58.200
 But before we get to Andy quickly, that definitely, if we get a photo of that, it's potato photographer

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:01.400
 of the year 2022.

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.400
 No question.

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:04.400
 Yeah.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.000
 An egg and chips plant.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.320
 So it's got to be, it's got to be a potato below ground.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.320
 Yep.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.320
 You've got the halfway there.

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:14.760
 But are you, chickens don't grow on trees as a second.

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:17.480
 Riddle me that, Sada.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:18.480
 Is it an, is it an aubergine?

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:19.480
 It's an egg plant.

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:20.480
 He's got it.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:21.480
 He's on the ground.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.960
 Aubergine above ground, potatoes below ground.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:25.960
 So good.

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:29.360
 It sounds, that sounds like one of those sayings, aubergine's above ground, potatoes below ground.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.400
 It sounds like I'm this in the streets, but I'm this in the sheets.

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:33.400
 You know?

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.840
 I'm an aubergine above ground, but I'm a potato below.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.840
 That's actually horrible.

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:39.840
 It's disgusting.

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:49.000
 I'm not sure you want the potatoes to be there, isn't it?

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.560
 Okay, it's time for fact number two, and that's my fact.

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:59.080
 My fact this week is that dissecting cadavers doesn't put you off your food.

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.520
 In fact, it actually makes you hungrier.

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:02.520
 Mmm.

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:04.520
 Do you mean dissecting?

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:05.520
 No.

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:07.520
 Say it normally.

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:08.520
 Sorry.

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:09.520
 Dissecting.

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:10.520
 Dissecting.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:11.520
 Yeah.

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:12.520
 It sounds pronounced, guys.

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.520
 So, fun fact for listeners.

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:19.480
 We had a chat before this episode recording started about how to say the word dissecting,

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:23.040
 and it turns out that dissecting is when you're only dividing something into two.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.040
 Yes.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.400
 But dissecting is only what pedants say.

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:31.000
 So in James Bond movies, when that laser is heading towards him to cut him right in half,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 the villains should be saying, "No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to be dissected."

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 No, dissected.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000
 What?

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 Are you kidding?

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 Because that's in two, and he would be cut in two pieces.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to dissect.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 Yeah.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 Yeah.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 No.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 He doesn't want James to dissect something.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 Dissecting is an active verb.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 So, Dan, what about these cadavers that I hear so much about?

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 Yeah, sorry.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 That is disgusting.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 Let's go back to your fact.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 People get hungry with dead bodies.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 Is it because it's meat?

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 Like, they're like literally cutting up meat?

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 No, it's not quite that, although it's a possibility that that's involved as well.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 What it is, is that in order for students, medical students, to practice dissection on

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 bodies, the bodies have to be preserved, and they're preserved in formaldehyde.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 So, that's a chemical that helps for them to stay fresh, and they can go through, and

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 they can practice all sorts of things.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 Now, there's a phenomenon which has been reported by so many doctors online, and I was told

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 this by a doctor friend, and I happen to have two doctor friends, so I asked another one,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 "Have you ever heard of, or experienced, when you were dissecting a body, a thing called

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 formaldehyde hunger?"

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 And he went, "Oh my God, I didn't even know that was a thing."

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 Yes, I've had that, that entire time, and everyone online talks about it.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 So, the idea is formaldehyde does something to you, where it makes you extremely hungry,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.300
 and if you look online at medical students talking about it, they talk about, it's not

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:59.800
 just a hunger, they get starving to the point where, as they're wrapping up, they all start

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:02.800
 talking about what they're going to eat, they exchange menu ideas.

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:08.800
 And one of them's like, "Wait a minute, this guy had nine fingers when he came in."

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.800
 It seems to be pretty widely acknowledged.

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:14.300
 I couldn't believe that all my doctor friends hadn't told me about it before when I asked

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:15.800
 them, but they were all like, "Oh, yeah, of course.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:16.800
 Yeah, you're starving.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:17.800
 Absolutely.

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:19.800
 All you want to do is bite the head off that dead body."

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.800
 It's like, "Well, why haven't you mentioned this before?"

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:23.800
 It's very weird.

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:27.300
 There was a study in rats, wasn't there, like there always has been.

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:32.300
 And they injected rats with formalin, which is where you get formaldehyde, and you put

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:33.800
 it in water.

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:39.800
 And when they gave these rats formalin, it increased how much sodium they took in.

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.800
 So, they really craved salt.

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:45.800
 So, that is a tiny bit of science, which suggests that it might be true.

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:51.300
 But obviously, for obvious reasons, one of which being that formaldehyde is toxic and

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:54.300
 pasnogenic, they haven't done the experiments on humans yet.

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:55.300
 Yes.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:59.800
 They do think that formaldehyde might cause sick building syndrome, which I'd never heard

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.800
 of, but which is what it sounds like.

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:02.800
 The building gets sick.

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:03.800
 Oh, okay.

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.800
 Apparently, it's not what it sounds like.

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:09.800
 To be fair, that is exactly what you made it sound like.

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:10.800
 Sorry.

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:11.800
 Yeah.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:12.800
 I've just seen how you could hear that.

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.800
 It's where people get sick in a building.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:18.800
 Sick person in a building syndrome is the full name.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:22.580
 And it's because formaldehyde has loads of uses I didn't know about, but one of them

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:25.420
 is as glue on wooden furniture.

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:28.580
 And if you're in a building which has lots of that, you can get a headache or you can

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:30.300
 get nauseous.

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:35.660
 And they found in a study in Japan in about the year 2000 that you can scatter lots of

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:42.500
 tea bags about the place, and if you do that, it'll soak it up and you will get less ill.

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:45.580
 Soaks up about 60 to 90% of the formaldehyde in the air.

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:46.580
 Really?

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:47.580
 You just scatter them around the building?

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:48.580
 Yeah.

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:49.580
 That seems to be what they did.

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:50.580
 Yeah.

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:51.580
 That feels risky to me.

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:58.140
 As a tea lover, I would think, oh great, someone's left out some tea bags for me.

00:19:58.140 --> 00:19:59.640
 I'll just brew these up.

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:04.240
 If you just see tea bags on the floor, you just pick them up and think, well, I might

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.480
 as well use some tea.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:06.480
 It depends.

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:09.520
 It is context dependent, but it's mostly dependent on how recently I've had a cup of

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:10.520
 tea.

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:13.940
 And if it's been more than half an hour, I'll probably pick it up.

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:20.180
 I was looking into the history of dissection and how medical students have been doing over

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:21.180
 the years.

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:27.020
 And I was reading a fantastic book called The Butchering Art, which is by Lindsay Fitzharris.

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:31.140
 And in the intro for a book, it just paints this amazing picture of what it was like in

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:35.740
 the 19th century in London when dissections were done publicly.

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:41.840
 So you would go into a theater and the rafters above where people could observe medical students

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:46.020
 would be packed not only with medical students, but random people off the street who were

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:48.420
 just fascinated with what was going on.

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:52.140
 They had to have people come in and make way and push people back so that the surgeon had

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:54.420
 enough space to actually do the operation.

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:58.140
 That's how tight it was, and there would be heckles as they were doing it if people were

00:20:58.140 --> 00:20:59.140
 in the way.

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:02.540
 So someone's doing surgery and people are going, heads, heads, saying, get your head

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:04.420
 out of the way so I get a better view of it.

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:07.940
 All right, this is what we want you to cut off.

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:08.940
 Elbows next.

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:12.360
 Shoulders, knees, toes.

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.800
 And this is a thing that used to be public entertainment.

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:19.920
 It went back all the way to the Renaissance where it was actually sort of billed as public

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:23.360
 entertainment to the point that when they were doing it, they would often have someone

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:30.000
 playing the flute to a dissection that was going on in the theater.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.880
 I thought you'd seen a ghost just then.

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.960
 And I thought you'd seen it in one of our zooms.

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:39.340
 And I thought it was like behind my back or something.

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:43.580
 And that's how scared we've got you mispronouncing things.

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:44.580
 I feel terrible.

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:47.580
 Like this is an abusive relationship.

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:51.700
 It does sound amazing, the shows that were on, and they were mostly in the winter in

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:55.020
 the European theaters because it was just too hot in the summer and they needed to make

00:21:55.020 --> 00:22:00.500
 a dissection take a couple of weeks, a full dissection would take weeks.

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:04.300
 But I really liked the rules that you had of who was doing the cutting up.

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:09.280
 So in Padua, there was a lector, a sektor, and an ostenzial.

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:11.080
 Those were the three jobs that you would have.

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:15.200
 And a lector was a lecturer who was lecturing while it was going on.

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:20.160
 The sektor, as you might guess, is the barber who's doing the cutting up, the barber surgeon

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.560
 who's doing the operation.

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:27.160
 And the ostenzial is just pointing to the bit of the body being dissected at the moment,

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:31.200
 which feels like being the kind of sheet music turner rather than one of the two main

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.200
 roles.

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:35.860
 Because otherwise, people don't know which bit is the arm and which bit is the leg and

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:36.860
 stuff.

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:37.860
 You're right.

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:38.860
 You're right.

00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:41.740
 I guess I'd just focus on which bit the surgeon was clearly cutting.

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:42.740
 Yeah.

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:46.280
 You would have thought that's an unnecessary second pointer to have when you've got the

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:48.560
 knife as the first pointer.

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.340
 Have you guys heard of Susan Potter?

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:51.500
 No.

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:57.780
 So Susan Potter, in the year 2000, she was 72 years old and she donated her body to medicine.

00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:04.120
 And she has died now, unfortunately, but they cut her body into 27,000 slivers, each one

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:09.560
 thinner than a human hair, and then photographed each side of it, each side of each slice.

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:14.640
 And now she is like a virtual cadaver, which medical students can use whenever they need

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:16.480
 to do any studying.

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.480
 That's unbelievable.

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:21.560
 So is that, is it so that you can be scanned sort of at any, you can just see what's going

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:22.560
 on at every single level.

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:23.560
 And I suppose that's...

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:24.560
 Yeah.

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:25.560
 It's like a 3D tour of the body, right?

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:26.560
 Yeah.

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:27.560
 Exactly that.

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:31.780
 So you can see the inside of your liver, or you can see the edge of your liver, or you

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:34.340
 can see any part of the body.

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:38.340
 And the really interesting thing about it is when she donated her body, she'd just been

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:42.220
 in a major car accident, and she was in a wheelchair, and people thought that she only

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:43.780
 had a year to live.

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:49.020
 And she continued to live for another 14 years after that, and kind of became quite friendly

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:51.900
 with the doctor who was going to do all the work.

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:56.660
 And they interviewed her quite a lot during that 14 years.

00:23:56.660 --> 00:24:01.240
 And now the plan, I don't think this is available yet, but in the future the plan might be that

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:08.560
 if you're a student looking at Mrs Potter's kidneys, you might, like Siri, ask her about

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:13.160
 her kidneys, and she could say, "Oh, I've had these kidneys for 72 years," and blah,

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:17.320
 blah, blah, and you would even be able to hear the voice of the person whose body you're

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:18.320
 looking at.

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:19.420
 That's incredible.

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:23.240
 They should make it that she just does constant small chat with the while they're trying to

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.240
 do it.

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:26.300
 Do you seem a very clever boy?

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:30.260
 Your parents must be very proud of you.

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:31.260
 Wow.

00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:35.180
 Makes you hungry, doesn't it, this?

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:40.300
 Do you guys know, so public dissections obviously stopped hundreds and hundreds of years ago,

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:45.300
 or hundreds of years ago rather, but there was one performed publicly in London in 2009.

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:47.540
 Oh yeah, I think I remember this.

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:48.540
 Oh, yeah.

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:49.540
 Was that Gunther von Hagen?

00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:50.540
 That's right, yeah.

00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:54.920
 So, Gunther von Hagen's, and it was filmed for Channel 4, and it went out, and so Gunther

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:59.420
 von Hagen's, he's the guy who in Piccadilly Circus in London, there used to be a giant

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:04.900
 Ripley's Believe It or Not Museum, and it's now this thing called Body World Exhibitions,

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:08.700
 and he's worked on this method, which is called plastination, and plastination is the

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:13.100
 idea of taking certain body fats and tissues out and replacing them with silicon so that

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:17.100
 the body doesn't deteriorate or smell, and so you can go inside and you can see all these

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:23.020
 dissected different things, and so it's pretty gross, and in 2009 he did this big show for

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:29.860
 Channel 4 where he had a body that was donated, dissected on TV, handing out to the crowd

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:33.940
 who were sitting there in their hundreds, bits of the body to look at closer on little

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:39.140
 plates as it was going around, yeah, and he was told that this was illegal and that he

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:43.500
 was going to be arrested, in fact police were there in the room to make an arrest if they

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:47.660
 thought that it went into a territory which was dubious, but he didn't get arrested on

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:48.660
 the road.

00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:50.940
 - How, sorry, police are not trained for that kind of decision.

00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:54.300
 They sent them inside the Ripley's Believe It or Not shot, were like, okay, watch this

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:56.220
 weird creepy shit happen.

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:59.900
 If you think it's a bit dodgy, arrest them.

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:01.460
 - What are they looking out for?

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:02.460
 What are they looking at?

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:06.100
 Like if he kills someone else and starts dissecting them, then you definitely slap the cuffs on

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:07.100
 him.

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:08.100
 - It's gotta just be that.

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:12.780
 - His thing is, he's now quite ill, in 2011 he got diagnosed with Parkinson's, and so

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:18.260
 his plan now is that he is going to be turned into one of his bits of art, and is going

00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:24.280
 to be in this Piccadilly Circus body world as an exhibition, just as part of the display,

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:28.500
 and it's his wife who's going to do it to him, and she doesn't want to do it.

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:33.080
 So he's granted her a year of not doing it, but then she has to.

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:35.260
 - That's not a year, that's not a grunt of anything.

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:38.380
 That's a year of worrying about this thing you have to do, apparently.

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:40.660
 - Oh, so she doesn't really have to do it, does she?

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:43.900
 - I don't think you can make that statement in your will saying, "I want someone to cut

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:45.780
 me up and plastinate me after my death."

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:50.140
 - She said that, he said to me, "Angelina, you were entitled to freeze me down to minus

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:55.900
 25 degrees for one year, but after that time, you really need to put your hands on me, because

00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:57.340
 otherwise I will get freeze-burned."

00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:58.340
 So-

00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:04.140
 - When he gets down to minus 25, he'll be gone to von Haagen-Dazs.

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:13.820
 - Please release that as an ice cream hug and dust, if you're listening, please.

00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:21.860
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Anna.

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:26.860
 - My fact this week is that on the day that the border between Spain and Gibraltar opened,

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:32.780
 the key to the gate didn't work, and they had to call a locksmith to let people through.

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:40.420
 I love this, it just sounds like such an awkward moment, and I kind of love the fact like borders

00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:42.640
 just being physical gates.

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:48.420
 So the border between Spain and Gibraltar was closed by Franco in 1969, and no one could

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:54.180
 really cross until 1982, December 1982, when it was reopened, and I was listening to an

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:59.180
 interview with a guy called Tito Belejo-Smith, who is a Gibraltarian, and he was there at

00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:03.660
 the time, and he said it came to midnight when they were going to open the gate, and

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:07.100
 he first said there was this argument between all the top officials over which one of them

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:11.080
 was going to open the gate, eventually the head of customs sees the key, said I'll do

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:17.000
 it, but the key didn't work, and they couldn't find the right key, and eventually they had

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.000
 to call a locksmith.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.500
 - So funny.

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:22.200
 - It's weird that the border was closed.

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:25.980
 Was it a power political move by General Franco?

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:26.980
 - Yes, it basically was.

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:29.900
 It was quite famous for that, wasn't it, Franco?

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:30.900
 - He loved a power move.

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:31.900
 - He did.

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:33.740
 He was pissed off with Gibraltar.

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:39.420
 Spain has a history of being, and there was a referendum, I think, in the late '60s about

00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:44.140
 whether Gibraltarians wanted to be British or wanted to have Spanish sovereignty, and

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:51.940
 it's the most astonishing result ever, because no vote rigging, no corruption, but 96% turnout

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:57.300
 and 99.6% of people voted to stick with British sovereignty.

00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:03.780
 - Quite similar to the vote in Crimea as well, wasn't it, which was no vote rigging, no corruption,

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:07.020
 just a massive, massive win for one of the sides.

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:14.020
 - Huge majority, both equally valid, but yeah, only 44 people voted to have Spanish sovereignty

00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:18.860
 against 12,138 who voted to be British, so Franco was kind of pissed off, and he got more

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:23.740
 and more hard line in terms of who could cross the border and when and trade between Gibraltar

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:27.740
 and Spain, and then he just shot it down, a little big fence, and literally, it's amazing

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:31.580
 when you hear about it, I hadn't realised that Gibraltarians just couldn't get across.

00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:36.260
 You could get a boat to Morocco and then sail the way around, but there was an interview

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:39.580
 with a guy who just said, you know, it was 15 when they opened the border, and it was

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:43.380
 the first time I'd ever seen a cow, 'cause I went across and they had farms on the other

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:44.380
 side.

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:45.380
 - Wow!

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:46.380
 Oh my God.

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:51.540
 'Cause it's tiny, imagine being stuck there, it's like 2.5 square miles.

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:54.220
 - Yeah, it is tiny, isn't it, but a lot of it is rock.

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:57.380
 It is a lot rock, but when you say, I watched a video earlier, 'cause I thought, I wonder

00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:58.380
 what it looks like.

00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:02.060
 All the descriptions just talk about rocks and tunnels and caves and so on, and I thought,

00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:07.180
 okay, it must be quite barren, and actually, the high street looks very much like a high

00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:12.860
 street you'd get in the UK, there's McDonald's, there's shops everywhere, it's bustling.

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:18.460
 The issue is, it's so tiny, and there is so little flat surface on Gibraltar that you

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:22.740
 know when you're sometimes going, driving on the road, and a train's coming, and you

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:28.020
 have to stop because the train and sex are the road, the airport runway intersects with

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:33.260
 their busiest main road, Winston Churchill Avenue, so they have to stop all the traffic

00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:38.460
 to let an easy jet plane land, and then they can start again.

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:42.180
 - Well, when they opened that bit of road, which was actually later, the Winston Churchill

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:47.140
 Avenue bit, that was in 1985, 'cause even 1982, it was only the pedestrian border that

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:51.380
 was open, they wouldn't let cars drive across, and there were loads of limitations on it.

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:56.620
 In 1985, they opened the road border, and I think they learned from the 1982 mistake,

00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:58.480
 'cause they did a practice run.

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:02.820
 So early on in the day, they did a practice run, and it was a good thing because since

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:08.100
 they'd shot it, the Spanish had laid two coats of tarmac on their side, and so the gate was

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:11.460
 completely jammed shut on their side.

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:13.460
 - That's amazing.

00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:17.700
 - They had to get a pneumatic drill and a workman to remove it.

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:24.340
 - It's a really strange place, and I think it occupies a big space in the British imagination,

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:26.900
 because it was this big outpost of empire.

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:31.260
 It changed hands so many times, didn't it, between various different nations who were

00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:32.260
 all claiming it.

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:37.580
 It's the site of the longest ever siege in British or English history, the great siege

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:40.700
 of Gibraltar went from 1779 to 1783.

00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:45.140
 There were huge French and Spanish naval and land forces attacking about 30,000 troops

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:50.220
 on that side, only about seven and a half thousand British troops, and they tried starving

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:54.360
 the British troops out, launched these huge assaults, there were tourists watching the

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:59.220
 final Franco-Spanish assault, who just assumed it was going to be a complete walkover.

00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:03.380
 Everyone applauded as the French and Spanish took their places to start the bombardment,

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:07.820
 and yet it withstood that, so it occupied this big space in the imperial imagination,

00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:08.820
 I guess.

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:14.860
 - As we said, this place, Gibraltar, has just constantly been under siege, there's always

00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:20.180
 been attempts to take it over and shift the ownership around, and one of those times was

00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:26.580
 in World War II, and this was a point where Winston Churchill had his eye on Gibraltar

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:31.860
 and wanted to make sure that we as the Brits kept hold of it, and one of the things that

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:38.860
 happened is that there's an old superstition, in Gibraltar, for the British, that if the

00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:44.820
 Barbary apes that live there left, kind of like how if the ravens left the Tower of London,

00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:50.420
 Britain's rain over it would fall, so Winston Churchill made a specific request to make

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:57.100
 sure there were always 24 of these Barbary apes on the island, even shipping some over

00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:58.820
 to make sure that they had this.

00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:04.260
 So I read this on WinstonChurchill.org, and he sent a directive to the Colonial Secretary

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:09.100
 saying the establishment of the apes on Gibraltar should be 24 and every effort should be made

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:14.020
 to reach this number as soon as possible and maintain it thereafter, and as a result of

00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:19.620
 this directive, the army appointed a non-commissioned officer who is the officer in charge of the

00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:25.060
 apes, and they had to just make sure that the apes were looked after, they were maintained.

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:30.540
 It was a role that was held by a guy called Sergeant Alfred Holmes for 38 years.

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:35.780
 No way, he must have just thought this is a relatively easy army post, no one is shooting

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:40.340
 at me, I just have to make sure none of the apes die, kept on pretending oh no it's actually

00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:43.580
 very difficult to get them to breed, I'm really struggling here.

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:46.340
 Do you think he was in charge of making them breed?

00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:48.580
 It sounds like he was in charge of bringing up their numbers.

00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:52.020
 Mostly bringing them in from another country rather than making them shug each other I

00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:53.020
 think.

00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:56.460
 Look, I don't know why he did for those 38 years.

00:33:56.460 --> 00:34:00.300
 But you've got to say, I don't know, there was a lot of resources being stretched in

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:06.300
 a lot of ways during WWII and was shipping 20 monkeys from Africa to Gibraltar really

00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:08.420
 the best use of our time and effort.

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:12.020
 There was a big plan to invade wasn't there, it was called Operation Felix, the German

00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:15.620
 plan to invade, but there was a big turf war between Hitler and Franco, Franco said no

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:21.020
 I only want Spain to invade and Spain was technically neutral, although it was the most

00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:24.620
 Nazi neutral country you could possibly imagine it was literally a fascist country.

00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:29.700
 And so Franco decided to stay neutral, but everyone thought it would be incredibly easy.

00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:33.780
 An aide to the governor thought it was impregnable as a poached egg and the Spanish thought it

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:37.140
 would take literally 20 minutes to invade if they ever actually bothered.

00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:40.020
 How overcooked is this guy's poached eggs?

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:43.700
 I think the point is that it's not impregnable right?

00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:44.700
 Right, sorry.

00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:48.820
 So like a poached egg it will just fall apart as soon as you pierce it.

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:49.820
 Exactly.

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:51.820
 James has understood the metaphor there.

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:56.220
 I was saying there's no way we can get in, that makes a lot of sense because it does

00:34:56.220 --> 00:34:57.860
 feel like the Nazis missed a trick.

00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:01.940
 It's a piece of piss to get to, it's really small, it's the entrance to the Mediterranean,

00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:06.260
 I don't know if we've said for any sort of confused American listeners, it's not just

00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:11.940
 a random place, or any other country you might not know where Gibraltar is, just because

00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:15.020
 America's quite far away.

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:18.820
 Only Anna America's a continent, not a country, I think you mean USA people, just to correct

00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:19.820
 you on your geography there.

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:24.620
 Look, I was just trying to help, and I know I've got in trouble now.

00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:27.300
 So yeah, it's really important, why didn't you go for it?

00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:32.660
 Because wasn't there a plan, because like an egg has lots of holes, tiny, tiny holes

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:35.460
 in it so that the chick can breathe on the inside.

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:39.620
 The Rock of Gibraltar has lots of little holes and caves, and wasn't there a thing where

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:42.700
 we put some soldiers inside one of those holes?

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:44.100
 Yes, there was.

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:50.580
 There was a cave which was set up so that if the island was overrun, a crew of six soldiers

00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:54.740
 only could stay behind, spy on the enemy movements and then report back.

00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:59.300
 So they had a year's food and water, I don't know what happens after the year is up.

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:03.060
 They had exercise bikes, which I love, and that was going to power the generator they

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:07.220
 used, I guess to run the radio and stay in contact with Britain.

00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:11.180
 But what a situation that would have been for those six left behind, the only troops

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:12.180
 not discovered.

00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:13.180
 It's amazing, isn't it?

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:14.020
 That is awesome.

00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:16.980
 The idea was that if one of them died, they couldn't take them out, because that would

00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:21.540
 tell everyone where they were, so they were going to bury them underneath the floor in

00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:24.020
 one of these caves, and that was the official plan.

00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:25.020
 Oh my God.

00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:26.020
 Really?

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:28.620
 Well, you can't put the formaldehyde on, because then you'll use up your food supplies quicker

00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:29.780
 than you want.

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:37.380
 Wow, that feels like it must have been the seven worst people in the British Army.

00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:40.500
 The guy who's guarding the apes and the six people they shove in the caves on Gibraltar,

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:44.700
 they're like, we've got to do something with these guys.

00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:50.500
 Just to go back quickly to the blockade of Gibraltar by Spain, it was quite interesting

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:56.020
 because before that happened, before the Second World War, basically, Gibraltar was sort of

00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:59.860
 Spanish in character, even though it was British territory.

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:04.900
 Everyone spoke Spanish, it was Spanish culture, Spanish families, you know, you'd have one

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:09.460
 half of your family on one side, the other half on the other, it was almost indistinguishable,

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:13.060
 and what one of these guys who I was listening to an interview with was saying was that the

00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:17.940
 blockade hardened Gibraltarian's attitudes, so it did complete the opposite of what Franco

00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:22.700
 wanted because he shut the border, and suddenly everyone in Gibraltar went, well, screw you

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:23.700
 then.

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:26.740
 And they did really well, and obviously they've got this access to the Mediterranean, and

00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:32.620
 they had all this food imported, and so before the war, I think a third of marriages were

00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:35.940
 intermarriages between Spanish and Gibraltarians.

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:40.900
 Everyone spoke Spanish, like I say, now most people in Gibraltar don't even speak Spanish,

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:45.180
 so you don't grow up speaking Spanish, and there's no intermarriage, they have completely

00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:49.140
 turned against Spain, so shot myself in the foot.

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:53.860
 And the keys have been quite a historical thing, haven't they, in Gibraltar, because

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:58.660
 over history, especially in like the 17th, 18th, 19th centuries, they only had a certain

00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:02.980
 number of doors that you could get into the country with, and they had special keys that

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:06.820
 they would lock it up every night, and they would have the ceremony of the keys like they

00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:08.220
 do in the Tower of London.

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:09.220
 Did they?

00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:10.220
 Right.

00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:11.220
 Yeah.

00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:15.420
 And during the Great Siege, which Andy was talking about, the governor who's called General

00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:20.860
 Sir George Augustus Elliott, apparently he would have the one set of keys, and he would

00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:22.940
 carry them everywhere he went.

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:26.780
 No matter where he went, he always had this set of keys on him, and it was rumoured, according

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:31.680
 to the website I read, it was rumoured that he slept with them under his pillow at night.

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:35.980
 They're massive keys, that must be a rumour, because it would be an incredibly uncomfortable

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:38.060
 night's sleep for you to put.

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:42.260
 I could just about put my house keys under my pillow, because I don't live in a medieval

00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:43.260
 fortress.

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:45.500
 Do you put your keys under your pillow when you go to bed?

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:50.580
 I'm just saying I could, I'm not telling you where I keep my keys, I've tried James.

00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:57.260
 I was just thinking you might get robbed by the Tooth Fairy.

00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:59.580
 Freaky weird Tooth Fairy this guy has.

00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:09.600
 Every morning I wake up with a quid, which then goes straight to Timbson's cutting another

00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:10.600
 set.

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:15.840
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Andy.

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:21.080
 My fact is that Aristotle's masterpiece was written more than 2,000 years after Aristotle

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:22.080
 died.

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:23.080
 Wow.

00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:25.120
 Yeah, a late bloomer.

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:30.060
 How much formaldehyde did he apply to his body to stay quite that active?

00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:34.460
 This is a 17th century book, Aristotle's Masterpiece.

00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:42.680
 It's a sex manual in a way, it's also a pregnancy manual, childbirth manual, all sorts of facts

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:49.520
 about human reproduction and generation and all of this, and it's got nothing to do with

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:50.520
 Aristotle.

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:57.880
 It's completely bogus as a title, but it was popular to put Aristotle in the title

00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:03.000
 of your book because it was a pseudonym that got used often for sex books because it was

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:08.600
 kind of known that he'd written a bit about reproduction, and so if you put Aristotle

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:11.200
 in the title of a book, that made it quite sexy.

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:13.440
 Was it like people actually thought it was by Aristotle, right?

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:16.440
 It wasn't like it was just the title, it was kind of claiming to be by him.

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:20.760
 I don't think, it did claim, but I don't think anyone seriously thought it was by him, apart

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:25.760
 from anything, it kept getting updated every year, and most people knew that he'd been

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:29.960
 dead for quite a long time, so I don't think anyone really thought it was by him.

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:34.080
 But yeah, like you say, Aristotle was like a reference for sex, basically.

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:38.800
 There are a lot of plays where people use the word "Aristotle" to mean "sexy times",

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:39.800
 yeah.

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:40.800
 But of how's your father?

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:41.800
 Yeah.

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:46.760
 Because it was published in 1684, and it was immediately a massive success.

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:50.920
 It was pirated immediately as well, despite the fact that they tried to copyright it and

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:54.480
 say "official publisher" was releasing the book.

00:40:54.480 --> 00:41:01.040
 But it was reprinted all the way up until the 1930s, and in the middle of the 18th century,

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:05.280
 there were more editions of this in circulation, this book, than all of the other works that

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:07.200
 were on reproduction combined.

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:08.200
 Whoa.

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:09.200
 It's insane.

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:10.200
 What does that mean?

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:12.760
 I saw that written down, but I couldn't work out what it meant.

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:16.560
 It'd be the equivalent of what to expect when you're expecting outselling all the other

00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:18.960
 books on the subject combined together.

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:21.680
 They still had more in circulation.

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:29.120
 And Aristotle had this real rep for being sexy, so the book Aristotle's Problems was

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:33.440
 published in 1595, which sounds like a fun agony uncle book.

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:38.500
 It was mostly, you know, lots of Q&As about sex and reproduction, so questions including

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:45.360
 what is carnal copulation and how are hermaphrodites begotten, and other really important stuff

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:46.600
 that you needed to know.

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:50.360
 It was exactly the format of the book that we've released this year, Funny You Should

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:51.360
 Ask.

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:55.560
 Exactly the format, but quite a different content, wasn't it?

00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:57.040
 No, I was reading it.

00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:58.040
 Sexy You Should Ask.

00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:01.040
 I was reading it and looking at the number of questions that are the same in that as

00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:03.320
 Funny You Should Ask, and there are quite a few.

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:07.960
 It's probably like, it made me think, how great that humans have been curious about the same

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:09.420
 shit for so long.

00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:13.100
 We didn't have how our hermaphrodites begotten.

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:14.100
 Okay, absolutely.

00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:17.140
 I did try to get that one in, and not acceptable.

00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:23.380
 There are a few sort of areas that we didn't cover, but like, why do we sneeze?

00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:25.940
 Why do you have only one mouth but two eyes?

00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:27.540
 Why is spit white?

00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:30.500
 Why do we like sweet taste so much more than others?

00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:34.540
 Why do men and women get ticklish when you tickle their armpits but nothing else?

00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:40.240
 I really thought, this guy's, whoever wrote this, not Aristotle, is a man after her own

00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:41.240
 heart.

00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:42.240
 Pseudo-Aristotle.

00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:43.240
 Yeah.

00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:46.440
 That was, this is a whole field of study, is books that claim to be by Aristotle but

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:52.520
 are manifestly not, and the author, the collective author of those is known as Pseudo-Aristotle,

00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:53.520
 which I love.

00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:56.920
 Basically, everyone had a copy of this Aristotle's masterpiece, didn't they?

00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:58.560
 They were really, really popular.

00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:03.360
 I was chatting to Ross McFarlane, who works at the Welcome Library, and they have quite

00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:09.200
 a few copies of this book there, and the ones that they have are quite small, they're printed

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:14.260
 on very cheap paper, you can tell that they're things that were mass produced and that people

00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:15.260
 would just own.

00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:20.060
 And one thing that would happen is sometimes, as they get towards the end of a page, the

00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:24.580
 font would get smaller and smaller and smaller so that they didn't have to have another page

00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:30.060
 at the end of it, and you would see often people would write things in them.

00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:34.400
 So there was one where they recorded all the births of their children, for instance, in

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:36.060
 there and stuff like that.

00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:38.840
 So yeah, it was, they were very quotidian.

00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:39.840
 That's such a good idea.

00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:40.840
 Yeah.

00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:46.400
 I can see successfully with Brian doing this, this one didn't work, tried it 12 times.

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:49.920
 Because there were these rules all the way through, which are obviously loads of them

00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:53.720
 are complete horlicks, you know, that male children sit on the right hand side of the

00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:57.280
 womb and girls sit on the left, not true.

00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:00.500
 If you want to test whether your child is a boy or a girl, drop a drop of milk into

00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:02.060
 a basin of water.

00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:05.340
 And if the milk sinks to the bottom intact, it's a girl.

00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:07.660
 If it spreads out and disperses, it's a boy.

00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:08.660
 That's not true.

00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:10.180
 You'll be amazed to hear.

00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:14.220
 Like it's, I can't believe that this book survived until 1930s because a lot of it is

00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:15.860
 just pure baloney.

00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:16.860
 Yeah.

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:18.500
 But it's entertaining baloney.

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:20.020
 If it's entertaining, you'll read it, right?

00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:21.020
 That's true.

00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:22.660
 And it's sexy baloney.

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:23.660
 Sexy baloney.

00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:24.660
 Yeah.

00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:30.200
 But with what James is saying about writing down the children and their birth dates, there's

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:36.600
 been a few cases where the book has been useful to prove things for people who've lost documentation.

00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:41.600
 So this book made it over to America and in 1832, in Tennessee, there was a guy called

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:46.260
 Edward Weart who was trying to get a pension in connection to his military service in the

00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:50.000
 Revolutionary War, but he had lost his discharge papers.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.680
 And so he needed to prove his age, but he had no way of proving his age.

00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:59.140
 And what the court records as his submission of proof was that this book, Aristotle's

00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:03.420
 Masterpiece, was brought in by him and it had in it his birth date as recorded by his

00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:05.580
 parents in it.

00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:09.720
 And they, that persuaded the court that he was born when he said he was born so he could

00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:10.720
 get the pension.

00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:12.900
 Sorry, why were people recording his birthday in the book?

00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:16.220
 Well, that was a thing parents used to write stuff all in the book.

00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:21.740
 So you would, you would record your children's birth dates in it because it just was a, it

00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:22.740
 was a place to put it.

00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:23.740
 It was a reproduction book.

00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:25.100
 Why not mark it down there?

00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:30.380
 You could say that, you know, he didn't have his discharge papers, but that he had his

00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:32.120
 parents discharge papers.

00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:33.120
 Oh dear.

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:36.280
 And that's a joke about his conception because obviously it's, um,

00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:38.040
 Do you have discharge papers, Andy?

00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:39.840
 Is that what, what is it like?

00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:41.340
 What are you like in the bedroom?

00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:48.260
 There's a lot of paperwork.

00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:52.180
 It's almost feels like some of that stuff is a lot better than actual Aristotle was

00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:53.380
 writing, right?

00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:58.620
 Because Aristotle, well, he was a genius for his time.

00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:03.220
 I think it's fair to say he got quite a lot of things wrong, but he did get a lot of things

00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:05.620
 wrong about women in his writings.

00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:12.340
 He thought that blonde women were better at getting orgasms than non-blonde women.

00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:15.080
 And that the orgasm was very important for conception.

00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:20.160
 So he thought that blonde women would be able to conceive better than non-blonde women.

00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:25.340
 He thought that women's discharge was very important for procreation.

00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:29.660
 And so he spent a lot of time, according to the article I read, trying to separate out

00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:32.060
 female fluids.

00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:36.660
 And he thought that if women ate pungent foods like garlic or peppers, they would be able

00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:38.160
 to conceive better.

00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:42.460
 I found it's definitely a hindrance rather than a hell.

00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:46.060
 He thought that women had fewer teeth than men.

00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:48.020
 Look, that is just a fact, James.

00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:52.480
 You can't argue with nature like that.

00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:57.080
 And he thought that women are more mischievous, less simple, more impulsive, more compassionate,

00:46:57.080 --> 00:47:01.520
 more easily moved to tears, more jealous, more crerulous, more apt to scold and strike,

00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:06.160
 more prone to despondency, less hopeful, more void of shame or self-respect, more false

00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:11.080
 of speech, more deceptive, more retentive of memory, more wakeful, more shrinking and

00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:13.840
 more difficult to rouse to action than men.

00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:14.840
 OK.

00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:15.840
 More shrinking?

00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:20.940
 I mean, there was a lot of wrong stuff in there, and it's quite strange that that's

00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:21.940
 weird.

00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:25.500
 Because there are a few things in there that you're like, oh, yeah, yeah.

00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:28.140
 And it's got to, it's a whole melange of compliments and insults.

00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:31.140
 It would be hard to know how to take that list, wouldn't it, if it came at you with

00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:32.140
 her?

00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:36.020
 I think probably best not to say that women are like X and men are like Y in general,

00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:38.700
 perhaps, even if some of them are compliments.

00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:39.700
 Let's just not say that.

00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:40.700
 I'll take the compliments.

00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:41.700
 Fuck it.

00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:43.200
 You take what you can get.

00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:44.200
 But is it possible?

00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:46.900
 I mean, this guy was slightly clever, wasn't he?

00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:48.300
 It was kind of a big deal.

00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:55.300
 Is it possible that back in the day women just did have less teeth?

00:47:55.300 --> 00:48:01.360
 I read a really good article of, there was a guy called H. L. Levy who was trying to

00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:07.060
 rescue Aristotle's reputation for misogynism because everyone thinks that he's misogynistic.

00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:11.280
 And he basically said, well, maybe it's not that he was misogynistic.

00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:16.080
 He just got all these things wrong about women because he got quite a lot wrong about everything.

00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:17.080
 Yeah.

00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:18.080
 Right.

00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:19.080
 Because he did quite get quite a lot wrong.

00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:21.580
 He must have got stuff wrong about men as well, right, presumably.

00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:22.580
 Yeah.

00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:28.740
 I think he said that men with bigger penises would be less good at fertilizing women because

00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:33.240
 that gives the sperm more time to get cold on their way over.

00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:38.020
 That does sound like something he said on a one night stand, doesn't it?

00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:43.920
 I think that makes sense because I've successfully had two children and it's not about the size,

00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:44.920
 guys.

00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:51.040
 I feel like we should say that also Aristotle, unlike some of the more fun, but more wild

00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:55.680
 ancients that we talk about, is still discussed today extensively in philosophy.

00:48:55.680 --> 00:49:00.920
 He's one of the great philosophical pillars and his idea that everything is in balance.

00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:06.120
 So the idea of a virtue is the exact equidistant between two extremes of vice.

00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:10.180
 Things like that are still discussed a lot, so let's give the guy some credit.

00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:11.540
 He was a bit sexist.

00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:14.740
 He believed some crazy stuff, but he was a great philosopher.

00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:18.540
 Thought that the oryx, which is the thing which turned into cows, thought that they

00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:24.780
 projectile pood 1.8 meters away from their bums and that the poos burned like fire to

00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:27.500
 get rid of predators.

00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:29.580
 It's not completely implausible.

00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:30.580
 Yeah.

00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:35.020
 He thought that an earthquake, he thought that the tremor of an earthquake was either

00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:39.920
 the earth farting, or you know that shiver when you pee sometimes.

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:43.480
 He thought it was the earth's equivalent of that kind of shivering pee.

00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:46.460
 Sorry, what's the shiver when you pee?

00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:49.840
 It's not a thing that everyone gets, but it's a relatively common thing that some people

00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:52.740
 like get a shiver down the back of their neck when they urinate.

00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:53.740
 Do they?

00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:54.740
 Wow.

00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:55.740
 Okay.

00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:56.740
 Sounds like someone else is urinating onto them.

00:49:56.740 --> 00:50:01.080
 I should be even reading the wrong texts.

00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:04.840
 Like that saying, don't piss up my back and tell me it's raining, right?

00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:05.840
 Yeah.

00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:12.060
 And he thought eels spontaneously generated from mud, but as we've said before, eels is

00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:13.060
 a tough one.

00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:14.060
 Yeah.

00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:15.060
 Eels is a really tough one.

00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:16.060
 Yes.

00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:17.060
 Yes.

00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:19.180
 Another one in this constant wrangle with me trying to defend this obviously very ancient

00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:24.540
 sexist but who was a genius is the eels thing is evidence that he was an empiricist.

00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:28.820
 And that was amazing at the time where his tutor, Plato and everyone else would just like come

00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:32.340
 up with theories and then we'll say they're true because they make sense.

00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:36.160
 And Aristotle said, should we actually look at what some stuff that's happening and start

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:37.320
 describing it instead?

00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:38.320
 So, yeah.

00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:42.560
 And then he went to eels and said, well, they don't have any genitals, which to be fair,

00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:48.160
 we thought for another 2000 years, you say, but that didn't stop Dan from having two children.

00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:50.640
 So Dan's paperwork was all in order, though.

00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:56.240
 It's mostly about paperwork I find in the bedroom.

00:50:56.240 --> 00:51:01.720
 There were things which, and again, this is the counterweight to all the absolutely true

00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:06.580
 stuff James has just said is so, for example, he observed that hairs can become doubly pregnant,

00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:09.340
 which wasn't believed to be true for centuries after him.

00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:14.020
 You know, hairs can become pregnant while already pregnant, as it were, they can do

00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:15.020
 that again.

00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:18.380
 He did think that elephants couldn't bend their knees and that they always had to sleep

00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:20.280
 upright because they couldn't bend their knees.

00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:25.380
 This is a grudge match between James on one side, Anna and Andy on the other saying Aristotle

00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:27.480
 was an idiot or a genius.

00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:29.780
 This is the thing I'm not sure about though, Anna, because I thought that he didn't do

00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:35.840
 actual experiments as in he was an empiricist, but he didn't, he didn't do the scientific

00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:39.480
 method to that extent, but he gathered a huge amount of data and then kind of extrapolated

00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:43.280
 an inferred based on that, which is still obviously a massive step forward from just

00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:45.280
 saying any old stuff.

00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:50.160
 And it was an attempt to categorize and sort things, which also obviously is a massive

00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:51.360
 cognitive leap forward.

00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:57.200
 So he divided animals into 11 grades from highest, lowest, highest, unsurprisingly humans.

00:51:57.200 --> 00:52:02.900
 And he said, you know, the best and the highest animals in nature are the ones that give live

00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:09.380
 birth to hot and wet creatures and that the worst animals, the lowest grade of nature

00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:10.380
 lay eggs.

00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:14.540
 They don't give birth to the live young and those are cold, dry eggs and that those are

00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:15.540
 the worst.

00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:16.540
 So I imagine chickens.

00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:18.540
 No, chickens warm, aren't they?

00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:19.540
 Chickens eggs are warm.

00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:21.540
 So I suppose like lizards.

00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:22.540
 Yeah.

00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:23.540
 I think it must be something.

00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:24.540
 Lizard is something reptilian.

00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:30.360
 I really love just thinking about how he was, you know, co-opted by all these people over

00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:33.140
 the years, how he still is co-opted today.

00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:37.640
 And if you look up Aristotle and look up articles that have been written about him,

00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:40.080
 they'll just apply his philosophy to everything.

00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:44.800
 So how Aristotle is the perfect happiness guru, guardian article.

00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:47.600
 Should we cancel Aristotle, New York Times article?

00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:48.600
 Sure.

00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:49.600
 It is, it is useful.

00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:53.840
 That thing that you said, Anna, about every virtue being a tightrope between two alternating

00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:54.840
 vices.

00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:55.840
 That is quite a clever idea.

00:52:55.840 --> 00:53:00.500
 So the idea is, for example, that bravery is a tightrope between cowardice on the one

00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:05.860
 hand and being completely foolhardy on the other side between those two is the golden

00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:11.180
 virtue, the golden mean of being brave when necessary.

00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:16.700
 Part of that theory was that basically everything that is extant kind of fits in its own niche,

00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:17.700
 right?

00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:20.300
 And that there wasn't a beginning to the universe and there isn't going to be an end to the

00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:21.300
 universe.

00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:26.320
 Everything just existed and the worms are where they should be and Aristotle's where

00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:28.560
 he should be and everything's, you know.

00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:29.560
 Yeah.

00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:36.000
 It was also an attempt to justify the social structure of Greek city-states vis-a-vis slavery

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:42.440
 and yeah, it was a justifying, it's just the way things are, guys, was kind of how you

00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:44.320
 could simplify his possession too.

00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:49.660
 I don't want a worm revolution any more than he does.

00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:54.100
 So the Aristotle's problems that you were talking about before, which Anna said is basically

00:53:54.100 --> 00:54:00.700
 the same as funny you should ask, each chapter begins with a poem and I wonder if we should

00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:03.340
 bring that for the next funny you should ask book.

00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:04.340
 Well.

00:54:04.340 --> 00:54:05.340
 We should start each chapter with a poem.

00:54:05.340 --> 00:54:06.340
 Watch this space.

00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:07.340
 Yeah.

00:54:07.340 --> 00:54:12.040
 So for instance, this is one of the chapters, "Thus man's most noble parts described we

00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:19.180
 see, for such the parts of generation be, are they that carefully surveyed will find,

00:54:19.180 --> 00:54:25.600
 each part is fitted for the use designed, the purest blood we find, if well we heed,

00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:28.640
 is in the testicles turned into seed."

00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:31.680
 Do you think that might work for our next QI poem?

00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:32.680
 That's absolutely beautiful.

00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:33.680
 I think not.

00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:34.680
 That's static.

00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:37.180
 Testicles does stick out a bit there in the poem, doesn't it?

00:54:37.180 --> 00:54:39.760
 It's difficult, isn't it, because the poem is about testicles.

00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:40.760
 Yeah.

00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:41.760
 So you do need testicles.

00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:44.880
 It's like Wordsworth's Daffodils poem.

00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:49.120
 The word Daffodil really sticks out in that poem, I have to say, but it's about Daffodils,

00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:50.120
 so you do.

00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:51.120
 Memorable.

00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:52.120
 Yeah.

00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:53.120
 Yeah.

00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:54.120
 Memorable.

00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:55.120
 I didn't see the testicles coming.

00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:56.120
 That felt like a twist to me.

00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:57.120
 Oh, don't twist the testicles.

00:54:57.120 --> 00:55:00.620
 Well, if you do, you won't see them coming.

00:55:00.620 --> 00:55:05.600
 Okay, that's it.

00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:06.840
 That is all of our facts.

00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:08.160
