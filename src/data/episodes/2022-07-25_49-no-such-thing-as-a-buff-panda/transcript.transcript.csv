00:00:10,00:00:14,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:14,00:00:16,to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:00:16,00:00:17,My name is Dan Triber.
00:00:17,00:00:21,"I'm sitting here with Andy Murray, Aniches and Ski and James Harkin."
00:00:21,00:00:24,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphone with our four favorite facts from"
00:00:24,00:00:28,"the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:28,00:00:29,Starting with you.
00:00:29,00:00:31,Andrew Hunter Murray.
00:00:31,00:00:35,"My fact is that until the mid-2000s, the best method for finding out how many pandas were"
00:00:35,00:00:38,alive was to sift through their poo.
00:00:38,00:00:40,Was that where they were hidden?
00:00:40,00:00:41,[Laughter]
00:00:41,00:00:44,You just had to look for the white bits.
00:00:44,00:00:45,[Laughter]
00:00:45,00:00:47,"Yeah, what does that mean?"
00:00:47,00:00:50,"Well, it's very, very hard to know how many pandas there are."
00:00:50,00:00:54,We've got no idea how many there are accurately and they do censuses every so often and they
00:00:54,00:00:58,"can be very, very, they can be based on a lot of guesswork."
00:00:58,00:01:04,"So the best method in the early 2000s, which came up with the total number of 1596, which"
00:01:04,00:01:10,"is very precise, was to go around looking for panda excrement, sift through it for undigested"
00:01:10,00:01:15,"fragments of bamboo and then find tooth marks on that, because tooth marks have a particular"
00:01:15,00:01:18,"like fingerprints though, it's supposedly unique."
00:01:18,00:01:20,And that's how you find out how many pandas there are.
00:01:20,00:01:23,So you were looking for pandas inside the poo?
00:01:23,00:01:24,"Yeah, wow."
00:01:24,00:01:25,In a way.
00:01:25,00:01:26,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:01:26,00:01:29,"There's a different, different tooth signature on every bite, basically."
00:01:29,00:01:31,Every panda has its own individual tooth marks.
00:01:31,00:01:35,"So I guess with pandas, it must be particularly useful, because bamboo has, like, has such hard"
00:01:35,00:01:36,"cellulose, doesn't it?"
00:01:36,00:01:37,So it was very hard to digest.
00:01:37,00:01:41,"I think, do they only digest 30% of it anyway or something and the rest of it?"
00:01:41,00:01:44,"They're all wrong pandas, you know, and they're carnivores."
00:01:44,00:01:45,And they're carnivores.
00:01:45,00:01:46,They're totally carnivores.
00:01:46,00:01:47,They're meant to be.
00:01:47,00:01:52,"They gave up eating meat several million years ago, but they're still built as carnivores."
00:01:52,00:01:55,"They have a sixth finger, don't they?"
00:01:55,00:01:59,"They have an opposable thumb, or what acts effectively as an opposable thumb."
00:01:59,00:02:04,"And there's a theory, so it's for, it's actually just a protruding bit of bone."
00:02:04,00:02:07,"And it's mainly, it's solely used to hold bamboo for them to eat it."
00:02:07,00:02:12,"But I think now there's a theory that that evolved back when they were carnivores, because"
00:02:12,00:02:16,"it helped them, I think it helped them dig away at their prey to try and kill each one."
00:02:16,00:02:19,"They do sometimes eat, like, insects and stuff."
00:02:19,00:02:22,"And little rodents, if they can get their hands on them, but normally they can't, because"
00:02:22,00:02:23,they're pandas.
00:02:23,00:02:25,It's very difficult for them to do anything.
00:02:25,00:02:27,"They're very slow moving, aren't they?"
00:02:27,00:02:28,"They are, yeah."
00:02:28,00:02:29,Sorry.
00:02:29,00:02:32,"There's a theory that they're only slow moving, because they change their diet."
00:02:32,00:02:38,"And because bamboo is so inefficient to eat, they then had to slow down, stop moving around,"
00:02:38,00:02:44,"have less sex, become fat, eat as much as you can, all of these behavioural changes come"
00:02:44,00:02:47,"from the evolutionary change, which is when there was bamboo everywhere, and it made sense."
00:02:47,00:02:49,It's basically like getting married.
00:02:49,00:02:54,"I don't know if there were ever thin pandas, it's kind of disgusting to think of, just like"
00:02:54,00:03:01,"really buff pandas walking around, sprinting, readily fast, and maybe they used to hype"
00:03:01,00:03:03,"an egg, because that's the reason they didn't hype an egg isn't it, because they can't"
00:03:03,00:03:07,"study, take a pause from eating, so he's such inefficient food."
00:03:07,00:03:13,"People have said that huge amounts of effort focused on them, and they're an evolutionary"
00:03:13,00:03:19,"dead end, which is not really fair, because we've removed all of their habitat."
00:03:19,00:03:24,"We've got to go around saying, ""Yeah, these guys are useless, they've got the bamboo, there's"
00:03:24,00:03:30,"no bamboo anywhere at the moment, what the hell, is not really fair."""
00:03:30,00:03:35,"My buddy Simon Wat, he's a scientist, and he does a lot of stand-up, he knows, and he"
00:03:35,00:03:39,tells us great fact about the WWF and the Panda logo.
00:03:39,00:03:42,Do you know why the panda is the logo for the WWF?
00:03:42,00:03:44,Was it because they thought they would die out?
00:03:44,00:03:45,No.
00:03:45,00:03:48,"It was a specific panda, a specific panda, isn't it?"
00:03:48,00:03:52,"It was all the basis, so this is Sir Peter Scott, who was the co-founder of the WWF, and"
00:03:52,00:03:54,who drew the original logo.
00:03:54,00:03:57,He said that obviously they're furry and they're beautiful and they're cute and people
00:03:57,00:03:59,"respond to them, but it was also one major reason."
00:03:59,00:04:01,Is it a black and white printing costume?
00:04:01,00:04:04,"It's a black and white animal print, black and white printing."
00:04:04,00:04:05,That's good.
00:04:05,00:04:06,Yeah.
00:04:06,00:04:08,Pandas defecate 40 times a day.
00:04:08,00:04:09,40?
00:04:09,00:04:10,Yeah.
00:04:10,00:04:13,"I mean, they eat a quarter of their own weight in food every day."
00:04:13,00:04:15,That's a lot of poo to sift through though.
00:04:15,00:04:16,Yeah.
00:04:16,00:04:18,They have evidence to gather your...
00:04:18,00:04:21,That's a lot of solid bamboo to be coming out of you as well.
00:04:21,00:04:22,No.
00:04:22,00:04:23,People work.
00:04:23,00:04:24,It's so sad.
00:04:24,00:04:28,"People work for years and they go out to China as Panda researchers, really excited and"
00:04:28,00:04:29,then they just don't see any.
00:04:29,00:04:35,I've read an article about the census and there was a guy called Daibo who's a wildlife
00:04:35,00:04:39,"biologist in the Chinese Forestry Ministry and he said, ""To be honest, I've been working"
00:04:39,00:04:42,"in these mountains for 20 years and I've never seen a panda in the wild."""
00:04:42,00:04:48,"Because he's working in the wrong places, isn't he?"
00:04:48,00:04:49,But you just...
00:04:49,00:04:52,"Also, when you're doing a census, you're not looking up for them."
00:04:52,00:04:55,You're looking at the ground desperately trying to spot their excriments.
00:04:55,00:04:56,Yeah.
00:04:56,00:04:59,So it's entirely possible that you're miss one because it's so fun to do something.
00:04:59,00:05:04,"But also, like these are, as you've said, fat, lazy animals."
00:05:04,00:05:08,How slow is this guy that he's able to find their excrement when not find them?
00:05:08,00:05:11,They're obviously close by.
00:05:11,00:05:15,20 years if he's finding it. They're in the neighborhood. They're very shy. They're very
00:05:15,00:05:18,shy. They're very shy. Would you be shy? Would you be shy to his wife each night? Did you see one
00:05:18,00:05:27,"today, dear? No. He's got his panda spotting notebook with no entries in it. There's one guy"
00:05:27,00:05:32,"every day who comes back into the office while he goes, ""I saw nine today."" Every day."
00:05:32,00:05:41,"Pandapu is, well, the world's most expensive cup of tea is made using Pandapu. It's this"
00:05:41,00:05:49,guy called Anjanshi and I think he started making it in 2013 and it costs 131 pounds for a cup
00:05:49,00:05:57,"and he uses 10 tons of Pandapu on his tea plantation to make his tea delicious. Oh, so it's not in"
00:05:57,00:06:02,"the tea itself. It grows the plant. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's used as the fertilizer. That's a relief."
00:06:02,00:06:09,"Yeah, relief. One lump or two. Yeah. Apparently it gives it a rich, a richer taste."
00:06:09,00:06:16,"Does it? I bet it does. Yeah. I mean, we get a bit sniffy about it but it's it's manure. It's"
00:06:16,00:06:20,"using fertiliser. Yes, yeah. No, no. I thought it was in, because they do sell dried out"
00:06:20,00:06:25,"Pandapu, you can buy it as paper, can't you from certain zoos in China. So I just thought"
00:06:25,00:06:29,"it might be, you know, why not? They're doing flattened it, don't they? They don't"
00:06:29,00:06:37,just be able to just write on this. You get a really lumpy envelope. I think I know who it's from.
00:06:38,00:06:45,"Just written on it. Still nothing. Do you remember, sorry, speaking of doing stuff to Pandas,"
00:06:45,00:06:52,"did we talk about that story of the Italian circus? No. And Italian circus a couple of years ago,"
00:06:52,00:06:58,"tried to pass off a pair of chow chow dogs as pandas by painting them and they're in,"
00:06:58,00:07:03,they're in serious trouble now for deceiving people and for animal cruelty. Skeptical customers
00:07:03,00:07:08,"were told that the two dogs, a male and a female, were actually half panda, half dog hybrids."
00:07:08,00:07:13,"So if you were skeptical, he said, I think these look a bit weird, they expected you to believe."
00:07:13,00:07:20,"Actually, that guy who works in China goes on holiday to Italy and he's like, you know what,"
00:07:20,00:07:24,we're going to go to the zoo because they've actually got pandas. We'll finally get to see one.
00:07:24,00:07:29,The first two lines in the Pandas spotting notebook are then just crossed out a few days later.
00:07:31,00:07:40,"Bit too late. I like this actually, in the article about, in the article about the disguise dogs,"
00:07:40,00:07:45,"it finished with the line, the owners may be facing additional charges for falsifying the animal"
00:07:45,00:07:53,passports. The dogs from Hungary also turned out to be six months younger than the document. So
00:07:53,00:08:01,it's claiming their pandas. But under age pandas. The Smithsonian got two pandas in 1976 or
00:08:02,00:08:05,and I'm not sure if these were the original pandas diplomacy ones but they were called
00:08:05,00:08:12,Sing Sing and Ling Ling. And this was at the time when they didn't really know how to
00:08:12,00:08:16,"encourage them to breed properly and the sentence is just this, it's a wonderful sentence."
00:08:16,00:08:21,"Sing Sing failed at his early attempts to inseminate Ling Ling, not much of a surprise considering"
00:08:21,00:08:28,"he tried to mate with her ear, wrist and foot. How do you how do you try mate with a wrist?"
00:08:28,00:08:42,Okay time for fact number two and that's my fact. My fact this week is that since 2007 the Wikipedia
00:08:42,00:08:48,"Brian Henderson has made more than 50,000 edits and all of them are exactly the same. Tracking down"
00:08:48,00:08:53,articles using the words comprised of and changing them to consists of. That's dedication.
00:08:53,00:08:58,I love it. Yeah. What a great guy who's definitely not wasting every minute of his life.
00:08:58,00:09:04,He's not wasting every minute. He does all of his edits on a Sunday night. I believe.
00:09:04,00:09:07,Yes. Yeah. And he's really. He's a heathen as well.
00:09:07,00:09:12,This guy makes all of his edits on a Sunday night. He has a special program. He's written
00:09:12,00:09:18,his own program which identifies when people have newly written comprises of or comprised of
00:09:18,00:09:24,he finds it and then he says and it typically takes about 10 seconds but that's because I've gotten
00:09:24,00:09:29,really really good at it. I've actually put a lot of thought into those 10 seconds. Some of them take
00:09:29,00:09:36,a lot longer. Some of them take minutes. Actually not the most edited entry on Wikipedia is.
00:09:36,00:09:39,What? It's the page for George W. Bush. Is that?
00:09:39,00:09:45,"Which has been edited 45,000 times. Is it just do we put full stop after W or not?"
00:09:45,00:09:51,"Yes, it's all that. Back and forth. It's been edited three times for every word in the article."
00:09:52,00:09:57,That says through to through November 2013. I'm not sure if it's only in that month it was edited
00:09:57,00:10:00,three times for every word in the article or whether that's in total history and total history.
00:10:00,00:10:05,"But either way, it's a lot. Here's a weird thing. That guy Brian Henderson, so who does these 50,000"
00:10:05,00:10:10,edits. I kind of thought that he must have the record from most edits on Wikipedia. And so I looked
00:10:10,00:10:16,into a list of the most edits ever made by George W. Bush. There's no doubt and don't.
00:10:19,00:10:24,Do you know what roughly number the most edits by single person? How many is this guy?
00:10:24,00:10:29,"50,000. Okay, so. And he's been going every Sunday since 2000. Sometimes that by seven."
00:10:29,00:10:37,"Yes, so 350,000. What's the answer? The answer is a guy called his username is co-alph k-o-a-u-f and"
00:10:37,00:10:48,"he has done 1455,693 edits. Wow. That's amazing. Okay, so I went on to the Wikipedia page for"
00:10:48,00:10:56,pedant. And that has been edited more than 500 times. I just thought I'd read all the different
00:10:56,00:11:03,"changes. One of the things was there are some quotes about pedantry on there. One of the quotes is,"
00:11:03,00:11:10,"""I am appendant when it comes to written English."" That's a quote by Garty Vixters. It's like a jokey"
00:11:10,00:11:17,"thing because someone in the edit page wrote, ""Changed pedant back to pendant yet again."""
00:11:17,00:11:27,So someone keeps changing that bad. That must be really annoying. I remember looking at the
00:11:27,00:11:34,"Wikipedia page entitled ""The Reliability of Wikipedia"" and finding the sentence, 90% of articles"
00:11:34,00:11:40,"on Wikipedia exhibit superior quality and then in square brackets on reliable source, question mark."
00:11:42,00:11:47,Have you ever looked at the most popular Wikipedia pages for various countries? No.
00:11:47,00:11:54,"No. They're just quite bizarre. So in Sweden in 2012, the top Wikipedia page that was searched,"
00:11:54,00:11:58,"that was clicked on was... Okay, we should guess. Oh, okay, think you'll guess this one. Sweden."
00:11:58,00:12:02,"William Shakespeare. Is there a coincidence that way you're saying, ""Will William Shakespeare?"""
00:12:02,00:12:08,"No, that's not the way I'm saying Sweden. Is it Sweden? Yeah. Okay. Got it. So that was Sweden."
00:12:08,00:12:12,Can't believe I guess William Schattener. I feel like an idiot now.
00:12:12,00:12:17,"Adult video actresses, pages are best in Japan. The second most clicked on Wikipedia page in"
00:12:17,00:12:23,Spain in 2012 was for the app symbol. Wow. And the most popular Wikipedia page in Germany that
00:12:23,00:12:31,year was the page on cul-de-sacs. And you know that game that you do on the Wikipedia where you
00:12:31,00:12:37,click on it and you're trying to get through the whole of the encyclopedia to get to a page.
00:12:37,00:12:40,"Wiki-race. Yeah, so you start over one word to another. Yeah, yeah."
00:12:40,00:12:44,"So in Germany, they get to cul-de-sac and there's no links there."
00:12:44,00:12:51,"Do you guys know what Jimmy Wales has said, his favourite Wikipedia pages? Was it Wales?"
00:12:51,00:12:58,No. The country. Was it William Schattener? Sweden?
00:12:58,00:13:04,"It's a very random one. It's a page called Metal Unglaut. Oh yeah, I know."
00:13:04,00:13:09,"Yeah, a page devoted to heavy metal bands that put a decorative Unglaut in their name."
00:13:09,00:13:13,"Oh yeah. Like a modely crew, maximum park."
00:13:13,00:13:18,"Motorhage. Yeah, that's what he says. And then the other one is a page for chocolate chip cookies."
00:13:18,00:13:24,"All right, you know, one more, you know, speaking of Jimmy Wales, he and the Wikipedia foundation"
00:13:24,00:13:30,"cracked down a few years ago on US Congress and banned them, banned any IP address with any"
00:13:30,00:13:34,"association with US Congress for making any Wikipedia edits because they were,"
00:13:34,00:13:38,it was during election period and they were just constantly vandalising each other's pages.
00:13:38,00:13:43,You do get that still from the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Lots of edits to Wikipedia pages.
00:13:43,00:13:48,"British politicians come from there. Good use of that. Dan and I went to a Wikimania event,"
00:13:48,00:13:52,which is for lots of Wikipedians and lots of editors and things like that. And it was in London
00:13:52,00:13:59,last year. Yes. And Dan was doing a speech about Wikipedia and did you make a page on the
00:13:59,00:14:04,"train? Yeah, so yeah, because one of the speakers at it, who's a comedian here in London and"
00:14:04,00:14:09,"scientists called Steve Cross, who runs a think called science show off, he came on and he,"
00:14:09,00:14:13,his whole talk was about how he didn't have a Wikipedia page. And you made one for him?
00:14:13,00:14:18,"No, I knew that he wasn't notable enough to make a Wikipedia page. That's what the problem was"
00:14:18,00:14:23,that he was saying that he can't get one. So what I made was one of those list pages and the list
00:14:23,00:14:27,was called the title of the page was people who don't have Wikipedia pages. And I put him as the
00:14:27,00:14:35,"first name and they deleted it within a minute. So can I read you just, I have one more thing about this,"
00:14:35,00:14:41,"which is that what I really, really like about the guy, Mr. Henderson. And I think, yeah, I mean,"
00:14:41,00:14:46,"I quite like his mission. I wouldn't do it myself, but it's quite, it's quite sweet in a way."
00:14:46,00:14:50,"I think it's sloppy English, I don't necessarily think it's wrong. But the first edit he made was on"
00:14:50,00:14:59,"the 14th of August 2006, which was for the article central processing unit. Right? Now the next one he made,"
00:14:59,00:15:04,"I think he made some other Wikipedia edits in between, but the next one he made for comprised of was"
00:15:04,00:15:11,on the 4th of January 2007. So that's about that's about four months difference. I just wonder what he
00:15:11,00:15:18,"did in that four months. He must have been thinking about it. Yeah, I'm glad I did that. I'll just do one more."
00:15:19,00:15:23,Just one. I've done one. I'll do another one. There probably aren't too many more. There was a point
00:15:23,00:15:28,"where he had dealt with all of them, every single one on Wikipedia. And then of course, because people"
00:15:28,00:15:35,write more articles and I guess also people get a bit proprietary or sometimes about their articles or
00:15:35,00:15:40,"articles that they've been editing a lot. And so if he changes it and they change it back, he tries not"
00:15:40,00:15:44,to immediately correct that again because he doesn't want to get on with his nerve. So that I think
00:15:44,00:15:50,"wasn't quite a friendly. And the other one, the other one that he has is that obviously if you"
00:15:50,00:15:55,"are quoting someone and they've used the words comprised of, you can't change that, that just sits"
00:15:55,00:16:00,there. And so he gets frustrated. He found like 150. My favorite thing about this fact is that
00:16:00,00:16:06,our show no such thing as a fish has a Wikipedia page in which all of our facts are put up on Wikipedia.
00:16:06,00:16:10,And now there's going to be 151 because this will now be a quote that he can't change.
00:16:10,00:16:15,Oh yeah. We're putting comprised of into our Wikipedia page because it's a fact that we've just said.
00:16:15,00:16:20,Oh that's so cruel. And it's so cruel because it's a fact that that's going to have his name in it as well.
00:16:20,00:16:21,Hi Brian. Hi Brian.
00:16:21,00:16:28,Okay time for fact number three. And that is James Harkin.
00:16:28,00:16:34,My fact is that the world's largest saw is used to cut through mountains in Kazakhstan.
00:16:34,00:16:36,Why are they cutting through mountains in Kazakhstan?
00:16:36,00:16:41,Mining. They're just mining for coal. Yeah they're looking for coal. It's a very impressive looking
00:16:41,00:16:46,"machine. It's terrifying actually. It looks just like a circular saw, only lots bigger. Do you know"
00:16:46,00:16:55,"how big it is? Yeah it's 145 feet in diameter and it weighs 45,000 tons. And it just basically"
00:16:55,00:17:02,anything in its path just gets sold out of the way. Can they change the axis of it so that it can
00:17:02,00:17:07,cut at an angle? I don't know. I don't think they can. Because you'd be very frustrated if the thing
00:17:07,00:17:14,you wanted was horizontal and you could only cut vertically. You probably can move it but it is
00:17:14,00:17:19,really really really heavy. Well it takes like 27 people to operate it right? Yeah. Yeah. So you've got one
00:17:19,00:17:24,person sitting inside. Apparently that's the prime position. 26 people outside? Yeah. I don't know why.
00:17:28,00:17:35,"It can dig out 4,500 tons of coal an hour. So it weighs 45,000 tons? Yeah. Bloody hell I know."
00:17:35,00:17:40,That's really heavy. But I just love this like the whole thing of big machinery and stuff.
00:17:40,00:17:45,Yeah. It's a nice subject. So the world's biggest boring machine. A tunneling as in boring.
00:17:45,00:17:51,"Yeah. And it's under, they're using it to make a tunnel in Seattle at the moment and it's got stuck."
00:17:51,00:17:57,So it's stuck underneath Seattle. Oh no. That would be a great sequel to sleepless insia.
00:17:57,00:18:03,I read the other day that Birmingham University has a bunch of disused tunnels under it which were built
00:18:03,00:18:09,in 1902 for mining students so they could practice mining. So they're fake mining tunnels.
00:18:09,00:18:13,Wow. Isn't that cool? Do you think they built it only a little bit underground? Because obviously it
00:18:13,00:18:17,would be a massive amount of effort to build a fake mining tunnel. Yeah they were. 200 feet down.
00:18:17,00:18:20,Yeah. I think we only went about 20 feet down or something. I have a cool fact about mines.
00:18:20,00:18:27,The very deepest mines you can't go down in just one lift because the weight of the cable
00:18:27,00:18:33,is so much that it would snap when when you were in the capsule at the bottom of the cable.
00:18:33,00:18:37,So you have to go down and then get another lift even further down. That's how deep into the
00:18:37,00:18:43,ground. Wow. It's also true of like super towers as well because I know I've been up some of the
00:18:43,00:18:47,tallest towers in the world and you always are on more than one lift there. Definitely in the
00:18:47,00:18:57,Kuala Lumpur. Yeah but there are two towers there so obviously you're going to have to do this. No sorry.
00:18:57,00:19:04,I have a thing about cables which is that Alaskan whales use cables like fishing rods
00:19:04,00:19:09,and fishing lines to eat their fish. What? Which is really interesting. I saw this in the
00:19:09,00:19:12,documentary the other day. So these fishermen go out and they throw these huge cables down
00:19:12,00:19:16,into the bottom of the ocean and they attach the side of it on hooks all these big fish.
00:19:16,00:19:21,And so bigger fish come and latch onto and start eating it and the whales have worked out that if
00:19:21,00:19:26,you slide down this cable with your mouth open you can eat all the fish so when they come up it's
00:19:26,00:19:31,half eaten fish. So they go fishing now. These Alaskan whales go fishing. Yeah it's really a very
00:19:31,00:19:37,cool look. They've got all this documentary footage. Back to sauce quickly. Do you guys know where
00:19:37,00:19:43,"the chainsaw was first invented? For childbirth wasn't it? Yeah I think it was all for, so it was in"
00:19:43,00:19:49,"1783 I think and it was just a little hand version of a chainsaw, hand-held version of a chainsaw"
00:19:49,00:19:56,and yeah it was for symphysiotomy which is a surgical procedure where you cut the cartilage to
00:19:56,00:20:03,wipe in the pelvis when a woman's giving birth. So it's nice and to cut bones generally. So they were
00:20:03,00:20:07,really useful in surgery in the 19th century weren't they? They were many used by doctors to cut
00:20:07,00:20:12,to amputate bones. It was called saw bones. That was an England for a doctor. I was looking at a list
00:20:12,00:20:21,"of different saws and there was, I know it wasn't one saw two saw three. Apparently there is a saw"
00:20:21,00:20:27,called a cold saw. Really? That's great. It's quite nice. Do you know what it does? Is it cooled down
00:20:27,00:20:33,to cut through hot things or is it? It's basically transfers the heat to the thing that it cuts so the
00:20:33,00:20:38,actual saw itself doesn't get too hot. That's pretty clever. But the thing you've stored into is
00:20:38,00:20:45,freaking boilers on fire. Hey so I was looking into mountains. Can I bring into mountains very quickly?
00:20:45,00:20:53,I found the smallest mountain in the world. Because I just thought there must be one right? There must be
00:20:53,00:20:58,the smallest mountain. I thought you had to be a certain number of feet to be a mountain. Okay so this
00:20:58,00:21:05,one is officially registered as a mountain. It's in Australia and it's called Mount Wichiproof.
00:21:05,00:21:10,It's actually an aboriginal word which is two words which she and pork and it means grass on a hill
00:21:10,00:21:17,and it totally makes sense because when you look at this it's the smallest mountain. It's 141 feet high.
00:21:17,00:21:22,So why is it claiming to be a mountain? It's just it's just registered as a mountain. It qualifies as a
00:21:22,00:21:27,mountain. I mean I guess a mountain must start at some height and that's the smallest. That's where it
00:21:27,00:21:32,starts. Oh that's the other. No that's it is. 141 feet is where the mountain starts. It starts at
00:21:32,00:21:36,something like 600 meters. But I think that it's one of those things like the definition of a county
00:21:36,00:21:40,which is quite fluid. I think you can get registered as a mountain by various dodgy.
00:21:40,00:21:47,Australia got an internet registry mountain server. I think it was a black market. You know I got
00:21:47,00:21:53,my license in an hour or nine. Like a Gillian McKee mountain. It's just $200 Australian dollars.
00:21:53,00:22:04,"Register yourself. We will mount it. This is my cat who is a mountain. Mr. Tibbles, many people have"
00:22:04,00:22:10,tried scaling him but died in the attempts. Yeah there is a rule about how high they are in the UK
00:22:10,00:22:15,"which is why that movie, the man who went up a hill and came down a mountain. The best you"
00:22:15,00:22:19,grant movie ever made. Is that what it's about? It's about the registration of mountains. It's about
00:22:19,00:22:27,him making the hill very slightly bigger than it was a mountain. It's really sad you watch the film
00:22:27,00:22:31,and it's one of those films. It reminded me of rabbit pre-fence because you follow Hugo on this
00:22:31,00:22:34,struggle to turn and say the gem mountain by adding a part of rocks to it or something. I can't
00:22:34,00:22:38,remember. And then the little right up at the end which tells you what happened afterwards because
00:22:38,00:22:42,I think it's based on a true story says a few years later it was then reclassified as a hill again.
00:22:42,00:22:49,Sorry. Is that really what the film's about? Yeah. Wow. I don't know. I thought you were just
00:22:49,00:22:54,running because I knew the title of the film but I just I just couldn't possibly believe that that
00:22:54,00:22:59,was what it was about. Basically he grant goes up this hill and then goes on the internet and buys
00:22:59,00:23:06,wait so why does he add rocks because it's just missing out on a high hill. Yeah it was like one meter
00:23:06,00:23:11,shot of being a mountain. Why did he want to make it a mountain? Because the village was all proud of
00:23:11,00:23:15,it. You've got to watch the film. It was a very touching kind of local story film. Okay and he's got
00:23:15,00:23:27,weirdly floppy straight hair. That's awful. I'm sure it's very. Okay time for a final
00:23:27,00:23:33,fact. The show and that is Hesinski. My fact is that in the early days of race walking or speed
00:23:33,00:23:41,walking the competitors were allowed to jog as necessary to relieve cramp. As in could they jog
00:23:41,00:23:45,forward or would they have to jog on the spot? So it's uncle I think they could jog forward. So it seems
00:23:45,00:23:51,to have been more of a gentlemanly thing to do was to admit when you didn't have cramp and therefore
00:23:51,00:23:57,walk and the understood rule was a fair heel and toe which as you can imagine is you have to have
00:23:57,00:24:03,your toe on the ground at the same time as your heel of the other foot hits the ground. There was one
00:24:03,00:24:09,football team. It was the one that WC Grace played for and whenever they got a penalty they always
00:24:09,00:24:13,deliberately missed the penalty because they couldn't believe that the other team would deliberately
00:24:13,00:24:20,do it very well. That's great. Race walking. Yeah you were saying about the pedestrianism.
00:24:20,00:24:28,Yeah so pedestrianism was where we got the sport speed walking and it started with British footman
00:24:28,00:24:33,in the 16th 17th centuries and it became a kind of a thing that gentleman like to do is compete over
00:24:33,00:24:38,how good their footman was or footman obviously had to walk next to a carriage. That's also a good
00:24:38,00:24:42,way that sport used to be where you didn't have to do it yourself you could get your slaves to
00:24:42,00:24:47,do it. Exactly and it was like a big gambling thing as you can imagine what bets were placed on
00:24:47,00:24:52,these people. Anyway Britain and the early 19th century and the most popular in America and the
00:24:52,00:24:58,late 19th they think and they were pretty easy going rule wise. I really like the the notion that
00:24:58,00:25:03,because they would do these walks which lasted for six days that's how the competitions were.
00:25:03,00:25:08,Yeah they would start on Sunday at midnight basically. Wait so this is the original. This is
00:25:08,00:25:12,what you were trying to do sport. So just to put this in context as well so this was in the late 1800s
00:25:12,00:25:19,it suddenly became the big sport in America. People were dying to see people walk. The story that I read
00:25:19,00:25:24,which is from a book that you got this fact from right which is a pedestrianism by Matthew Algeo or
00:25:24,00:25:31,Algeo came out last year. Yeah so from what I read it is that it kind of started as a craze when a person
00:25:31,00:25:36,had a bet with someone else about who was going to win the presidential election and the loser of
00:25:36,00:25:43,the bet had to walk all the way to the inauguration and that was a 10 day walkably from Boston to Washington
00:25:43,00:25:49,DC and Lincoln won the election and this guy lost his bet. He did the walk and it got such press that
00:25:49,00:25:54,all these people came to watch it and he had such a success that he kind of just went and it was a
00:25:54,00:25:59,line that I read it which I loved it said let's take this indoors and he started walking around a
00:25:59,00:26:04,rink and he started making money for it and then it turned into this big sport where everyone started
00:26:04,00:26:09,competing and he ended up using the original Madison Square Garden and huge crowds came in to watch
00:26:09,00:26:14,the thing because people they want to have had cars in those days presumably so people would walk
00:26:14,00:26:19,from miles around to see other people walking but they walked through from what I read in this book
00:26:19,00:26:25,21 hours a day for six days it's amazing it's insane and they had a cot on the side that they would
00:26:25,00:26:32,take naps in which must have been really hard with the thousands of screaming cheers and the yeah
00:26:32,00:26:36,but yeah and they would cover about 600 miles I think in the six days so about a hundred miles a day
00:26:36,00:26:41,but if they were racing as well I do love those naps as the kind of like the formula one that stops yeah
00:26:41,00:26:45,yeah but you'd go in and have a three hour nap and then you'd wake up and be like oh I'm still
00:26:45,00:26:50,two laps ahead while you and I think people would come in and change your things very very slowly
00:26:50,00:26:56,change your diapers yeah because presumably you'd have to go to the bathroom at times yeah I wonder
00:26:56,00:27:00,what you do there presumably there was a toilet there like a pottedoo and they just have to be in the
00:27:00,00:27:07,camp yeah maybe in the middle of the the camp that's why they only really stayed in there for about three
00:27:07,00:27:11,hours the motivation to get out and get back walking I think you should ever have children then
00:27:11,00:27:18,I very much admire marathon walkers and runners for their ability to just have a shit and a piss
00:27:18,00:27:24,wherever they go damn like like what was Paul uh right yeah I think that I wouldn't have dedicated
00:27:24,00:27:28,to the sport I think you don't really care about that kind of thing that's what I mean it's true
00:27:28,00:27:33,the newborn babies are the most dedicated sports athletes I was just going to say the guy
00:27:33,00:27:37,that Dan was talking about is called Edward Payson Western and yeah so they did have it before
00:27:37,00:27:41,because it was very popular in Britain in in the same kind of format in the early 19th century but
00:27:41,00:27:47,yeah he was the first big star of it I think and he I think I've been also the first case or one
00:27:47,00:27:53,of the first cases of a doping scandal uh because he got in trouble for winning a race under the
00:27:53,00:27:58,influence of coca leaves which was not actually against the rules but it was thought to be again
00:27:58,00:28:03,very unsportsman like and people were really upset his outright cheating um he admitted that he
00:28:03,00:28:08,used the coca leaves in the race in 1876 but he said he it was under the advice of his doctor and so
00:28:08,00:28:14,perfectly okay we all use that excuse when found with cocaine at work um do you know what the first
00:28:14,00:28:22,doping offence and the Olympics was was it in ancient Greece wasn't was it was in alcohol yeah
00:28:22,00:28:27,and the first one two beers and it was a guy I think it was in shooting yeah it was in the shooting
00:28:27,00:28:32,and he had two beers to calm his nerves yeah and they said that wasn't allowed so it's great of all
00:28:32,00:28:37,the sports to be drunk and do most dangerous for the spectators so there's one more thing about that
00:28:37,00:28:42,guy western who walked to the White House he didn't make it in time for the inauguration
00:28:42,00:28:48,he was several hours late and then president and he met president Lincoln and Lincoln um he went
00:28:48,00:28:53,to the first party at the White House and president Lincoln offered to pay his train fare back to Boston
00:28:53,00:29:02,and he said no I didn't make it so I'll walk back yeah oh my god is it fantastic that's true
00:29:02,00:29:09,do you know who popularized or who was the first recreational um client sort of climber rock climber
00:29:09,00:29:15,until climber in Britain no no I don't it was twiggy I was gonna say twiggy that's so weird yeah
00:29:15,00:29:20,Jenny only was going to say twiggy because it gets trees on mountains it's a natural name it sounds
00:29:20,00:29:25,it's a Christopher walkin oh very nice thank you because he's climbing what about oh climb
00:29:25,00:29:31,rock Hudson yeah that's good the rock kid rock you got to go older though I think okay stop being
00:29:31,00:29:38,silly boys okay right uh it was code of rich oh he's so he is it because the word ridges in his name
00:29:38,00:29:43,actually there you go we shouldn't we see if we kept going we would have gone to it
00:29:44,00:29:50,you say silly oh Kohler has made the first recorded recreational mountain climb in the UK um and
00:29:50,00:29:53,he was like this right yeah he was the first recorded person to climb up Scarfell Pike which is
00:29:53,00:29:58,the highest mountain in England and uh yeah and apparently he took an extremely dangerous route
00:29:58,00:30:07,down and nearly died uh he I know some things about him he uh liked eating fruit while it was still on
00:30:07,00:30:15,the tree yeah okay and he wore this huge gown which had stars and crescent moons all over it and it
00:30:15,00:30:22,made him look like a wizard wow yeah you sure you're thinking of him yeah I think I've dumbledore again
00:30:22,00:30:30,okay I want to do some FAQs from the race walking associations website go on before we finish yeah
00:30:30,00:30:39,okay so the second question on there is why not simply run fair it's a good question isn't it yeah
00:30:39,00:30:44,I can't think of an answer and their answer is running is certainly faster but one of the interests of
00:30:44,00:30:50,the spot is achieving good performances within the restrictions of the rules that's true I mean
00:30:50,00:30:55,that's like saying oh netball why not just let them go all over the court what does that's a different
00:30:55,00:31:01,sport yes very good why not let them play football yeah why not just pick up the ball this should have
00:31:01,00:31:05,been the real answer to the FAQ what you guys are saying right now yeah sure and why don't we just
00:31:05,00:31:10,rob everything wouldn't that be easier than earning money into buy things why is there anything
00:31:10,00:31:18,rather than nothing thanks Einstein you need rules idiot another question yeah it's one more um
00:31:19,00:31:27,do people not make fun of you when you're race walking it can't be denied that there are some
00:31:27,00:31:34,idiots usually overweight people in cars who think that race walking looks funny
00:31:34,00:31:42,um don't take them on unless you're a judo expert or a lawyer they're usually driving too fast
00:31:42,00:31:51,be to catch them anyway don't try chaser but you'll be disqualified with the rules section unless
00:31:51,00:31:57,you've got cramp then you can go yeah anyway I've got to go take a shit in the streets because why not
00:31:57,00:32:09,sign pull a reckless okay that's it that's our facts thanks so much for listening if you want to
