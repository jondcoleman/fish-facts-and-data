00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.420
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.860
 to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:17.860
 My name is Dan Triber.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.300
 I'm sitting here with Andy Murray, Aniches and Ski and James Harkin.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.820
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphone with our four favorite facts from

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.820
 the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:29.820
 Starting with you.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.660
 Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.860
 My fact is that until the mid-2000s, the best method for finding out how many pandas were

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.360
 alive was to sift through their poo.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.900
 Was that where they were hidden?

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:41.900
 [Laughter]

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.380
 You just had to look for the white bits.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.380
 [Laughter]

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.380
 Yeah, what does that mean?

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.420
 Well, it's very, very hard to know how many pandas there are.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.860
 We've got no idea how many there are accurately and they do censuses every so often and they

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.220
 can be very, very, they can be based on a lot of guesswork.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:04.500
 So the best method in the early 2000s, which came up with the total number of 1596, which

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.780
 is very precise, was to go around looking for panda excrement, sift through it for undigested

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.620
 fragments of bamboo and then find tooth marks on that, because tooth marks have a particular

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.540
 like fingerprints though, it's supposedly unique.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.840
 And that's how you find out how many pandas there are.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.100
 So you were looking for pandas inside the poo?

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.100
 Yeah, wow.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.100
 In a way.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.100
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.580
 There's a different, different tooth signature on every bite, basically.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.820
 Every panda has its own individual tooth marks.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.820
 So I guess with pandas, it must be particularly useful, because bamboo has, like, has such hard

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:36.820
 cellulose, doesn't it?

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:37.820
 So it was very hard to digest.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.500
 I think, do they only digest 30% of it anyway or something and the rest of it?

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.700
 They're all wrong pandas, you know, and they're carnivores.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.700
 And they're carnivores.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.700
 They're totally carnivores.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.700
 They're meant to be.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.900
 They gave up eating meat several million years ago, but they're still built as carnivores.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.540
 They have a sixth finger, don't they?

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.940
 They have an opposable thumb, or what acts effectively as an opposable thumb.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.100
 And there's a theory, so it's for, it's actually just a protruding bit of bone.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.580
 And it's mainly, it's solely used to hold bamboo for them to eat it.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.420
 But I think now there's a theory that that evolved back when they were carnivores, because

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.580
 it helped them, I think it helped them dig away at their prey to try and kill each one.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.180
 They do sometimes eat, like, insects and stuff.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.900
 And little rodents, if they can get their hands on them, but normally they can't, because

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:23.900
 they're pandas.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.900
 It's very difficult for them to do anything.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.260
 They're very slow moving, aren't they?

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.260
 They are, yeah.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.260
 Sorry.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.940
 There's a theory that they're only slow moving, because they change their diet.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.980
 And because bamboo is so inefficient to eat, they then had to slow down, stop moving around,

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.420
 have less sex, become fat, eat as much as you can, all of these behavioural changes come

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.740
 from the evolutionary change, which is when there was bamboo everywhere, and it made sense.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.740
 It's basically like getting married.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.980
 I don't know if there were ever thin pandas, it's kind of disgusting to think of, just like

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:01.660
 really buff pandas walking around, sprinting, readily fast, and maybe they used to hype

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.940
 an egg, because that's the reason they didn't hype an egg isn't it, because they can't

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.780
 study, take a pause from eating, so he's such inefficient food.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.340
 People have said that huge amounts of effort focused on them, and they're an evolutionary

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:19.700
 dead end, which is not really fair, because we've removed all of their habitat.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.660
 We've got to go around saying, "Yeah, these guys are useless, they've got the bamboo, there's

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.340
 no bamboo anywhere at the moment, what the hell, is not really fair."

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.220
 My buddy Simon Wat, he's a scientist, and he does a lot of stand-up, he knows, and he

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.700
 tells us great fact about the WWF and the Panda logo.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.980
 Do you know why the panda is the logo for the WWF?

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.700
 Was it because they thought they would die out?

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:45.700
 No.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.380
 It was a specific panda, a specific panda, isn't it?

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.940
 It was all the basis, so this is Sir Peter Scott, who was the co-founder of the WWF, and

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.220
 who drew the original logo.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.300
 He said that obviously they're furry and they're beautiful and they're cute and people

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.940
 respond to them, but it was also one major reason.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.540
 Is it a black and white printing costume?

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.340
 It's a black and white animal print, black and white printing.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.340
 That's good.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.340
 Yeah.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.780
 Pandas defecate 40 times a day.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:09.780
 40?

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:10.780
 Yeah.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.620
 I mean, they eat a quarter of their own weight in food every day.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.380
 That's a lot of poo to sift through though.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.380
 Yeah.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.380
 They have evidence to gather your...

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.420
 That's a lot of solid bamboo to be coming out of you as well.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:22.420
 No.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.420
 People work.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:24.420
 It's so sad.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.260
 People work for years and they go out to China as Panda researchers, really excited and

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.860
 then they just don't see any.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:35.100
 I've read an article about the census and there was a guy called Daibo who's a wildlife

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.180
 biologist in the Chinese Forestry Ministry and he said, "To be honest, I've been working

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.780
 in these mountains for 20 years and I've never seen a panda in the wild."

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.620
 Because he's working in the wrong places, isn't he?

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:49.620
 But you just...

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.940
 Also, when you're doing a census, you're not looking up for them.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.060
 You're looking at the ground desperately trying to spot their excriments.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.060
 Yeah.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.620
 So it's entirely possible that you're miss one because it's so fun to do something.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.460
 But also, like these are, as you've said, fat, lazy animals.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.980
 How slow is this guy that he's able to find their excrement when not find them?

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.820
 They're obviously close by.

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.740
 20 years if he's finding it. They're in the neighborhood. They're very shy. They're very

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.860
 shy. They're very shy. Would you be shy? Would you be shy to his wife each night? Did you see one

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:27.660
 today, dear? No. He's got his panda spotting notebook with no entries in it. There's one guy

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.860
 every day who comes back into the office while he goes, "I saw nine today." Every day.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:41.740
 Pandapu is, well, the world's most expensive cup of tea is made using Pandapu. It's this

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:49.580
 guy called Anjanshi and I think he started making it in 2013 and it costs 131 pounds for a cup

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:57.260
 and he uses 10 tons of Pandapu on his tea plantation to make his tea delicious. Oh, so it's not in

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:02.380
 the tea itself. It grows the plant. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's used as the fertilizer. That's a relief.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:09.900
 Yeah, relief. One lump or two. Yeah. Apparently it gives it a rich, a richer taste.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:16.060
 Does it? I bet it does. Yeah. I mean, we get a bit sniffy about it but it's it's manure. It's

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:20.620
 using fertiliser. Yes, yeah. No, no. I thought it was in, because they do sell dried out

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:25.660
 Pandapu, you can buy it as paper, can't you from certain zoos in China. So I just thought

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.260
 it might be, you know, why not? They're doing flattened it, don't they? They don't

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:37.340
 just be able to just write on this. You get a really lumpy envelope. I think I know who it's from.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:45.900
 Just written on it. Still nothing. Do you remember, sorry, speaking of doing stuff to Pandas,

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:52.940
 did we talk about that story of the Italian circus? No. And Italian circus a couple of years ago,

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:58.140
 tried to pass off a pair of chow chow dogs as pandas by painting them and they're in,

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:03.340
 they're in serious trouble now for deceiving people and for animal cruelty. Skeptical customers

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:08.860
 were told that the two dogs, a male and a female, were actually half panda, half dog hybrids.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:13.420
 So if you were skeptical, he said, I think these look a bit weird, they expected you to believe.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:20.380
 Actually, that guy who works in China goes on holiday to Italy and he's like, you know what,

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:24.220
 we're going to go to the zoo because they've actually got pandas. We'll finally get to see one.

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:29.580
 The first two lines in the Pandas spotting notebook are then just crossed out a few days later.

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:40.140
 Bit too late. I like this actually, in the article about, in the article about the disguise dogs,

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:45.900
 it finished with the line, the owners may be facing additional charges for falsifying the animal

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:53.500
 passports. The dogs from Hungary also turned out to be six months younger than the document. So

00:07:53.500 --> 00:08:01.660
 it's claiming their pandas. But under age pandas. The Smithsonian got two pandas in 1976 or

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:05.740
 and I'm not sure if these were the original pandas diplomacy ones but they were called

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:12.060
 Sing Sing and Ling Ling. And this was at the time when they didn't really know how to

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:16.860
 encourage them to breed properly and the sentence is just this, it's a wonderful sentence.

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:21.500
 Sing Sing failed at his early attempts to inseminate Ling Ling, not much of a surprise considering

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:28.700
 he tried to mate with her ear, wrist and foot. How do you how do you try mate with a wrist?

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:42.140
 Okay time for fact number two and that's my fact. My fact this week is that since 2007 the Wikipedia

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:48.140
 Brian Henderson has made more than 50,000 edits and all of them are exactly the same. Tracking down

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:53.580
 articles using the words comprised of and changing them to consists of. That's dedication.

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:58.460
 I love it. Yeah. What a great guy who's definitely not wasting every minute of his life.

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:04.700
 He's not wasting every minute. He does all of his edits on a Sunday night. I believe.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.180
 Yes. Yeah. And he's really. He's a heathen as well.

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:12.380
 This guy makes all of his edits on a Sunday night. He has a special program. He's written

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:18.620
 his own program which identifies when people have newly written comprises of or comprised of

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:24.060
 he finds it and then he says and it typically takes about 10 seconds but that's because I've gotten

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:29.180
 really really good at it. I've actually put a lot of thought into those 10 seconds. Some of them take

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:36.220
 a lot longer. Some of them take minutes. Actually not the most edited entry on Wikipedia is.

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:39.260
 What? It's the page for George W. Bush. Is that?

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:45.740
 Which has been edited 45,000 times. Is it just do we put full stop after W or not?

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:51.100
 Yes, it's all that. Back and forth. It's been edited three times for every word in the article.

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:57.420
 That says through to through November 2013. I'm not sure if it's only in that month it was edited

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.860
 three times for every word in the article or whether that's in total history and total history.

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:05.740
 But either way, it's a lot. Here's a weird thing. That guy Brian Henderson, so who does these 50,000

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:10.940
 edits. I kind of thought that he must have the record from most edits on Wikipedia. And so I looked

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:16.780
 into a list of the most edits ever made by George W. Bush. There's no doubt and don't.

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:24.060
 Do you know what roughly number the most edits by single person? How many is this guy?

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:29.740
 50,000. Okay, so. And he's been going every Sunday since 2000. Sometimes that by seven.

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:37.580
 Yes, so 350,000. What's the answer? The answer is a guy called his username is co-alph k-o-a-u-f and

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:48.540
 he has done 1455,693 edits. Wow. That's amazing. Okay, so I went on to the Wikipedia page for

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:56.220
 pedant. And that has been edited more than 500 times. I just thought I'd read all the different

00:10:56.220 --> 00:11:03.980
 changes. One of the things was there are some quotes about pedantry on there. One of the quotes is,

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:10.860
 "I am appendant when it comes to written English." That's a quote by Garty Vixters. It's like a jokey

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:17.020
 thing because someone in the edit page wrote, "Changed pedant back to pendant yet again."

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:27.180
 So someone keeps changing that bad. That must be really annoying. I remember looking at the

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:34.380
 Wikipedia page entitled "The Reliability of Wikipedia" and finding the sentence, 90% of articles

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:40.620
 on Wikipedia exhibit superior quality and then in square brackets on reliable source, question mark.

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:47.900
 Have you ever looked at the most popular Wikipedia pages for various countries? No.

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:54.220
 No. They're just quite bizarre. So in Sweden in 2012, the top Wikipedia page that was searched,

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:58.380
 that was clicked on was... Okay, we should guess. Oh, okay, think you'll guess this one. Sweden.

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:02.140
 William Shakespeare. Is there a coincidence that way you're saying, "Will William Shakespeare?"

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:08.060
 No, that's not the way I'm saying Sweden. Is it Sweden? Yeah. Okay. Got it. So that was Sweden.

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:12.140
 Can't believe I guess William Schattener. I feel like an idiot now.

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:17.660
 Adult video actresses, pages are best in Japan. The second most clicked on Wikipedia page in

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:23.500
 Spain in 2012 was for the app symbol. Wow. And the most popular Wikipedia page in Germany that

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:31.740
 year was the page on cul-de-sacs. And you know that game that you do on the Wikipedia where you

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:37.180
 click on it and you're trying to get through the whole of the encyclopedia to get to a page.

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:40.700
 Wiki-race. Yeah, so you start over one word to another. Yeah, yeah.

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:44.540
 So in Germany, they get to cul-de-sac and there's no links there.

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:51.900
 Do you guys know what Jimmy Wales has said, his favourite Wikipedia pages? Was it Wales?

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:58.220
 No. The country. Was it William Schattener? Sweden?

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:04.140
 It's a very random one. It's a page called Metal Unglaut. Oh yeah, I know.

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:09.820
 Yeah, a page devoted to heavy metal bands that put a decorative Unglaut in their name.

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:13.580
 Oh yeah. Like a modely crew, maximum park.

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:18.940
 Motorhage. Yeah, that's what he says. And then the other one is a page for chocolate chip cookies.

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:24.700
 All right, you know, one more, you know, speaking of Jimmy Wales, he and the Wikipedia foundation

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:30.140
 cracked down a few years ago on US Congress and banned them, banned any IP address with any

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:34.700
 association with US Congress for making any Wikipedia edits because they were,

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:38.220
 it was during election period and they were just constantly vandalising each other's pages.

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:43.740
 You do get that still from the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Lots of edits to Wikipedia pages.

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:48.620
 British politicians come from there. Good use of that. Dan and I went to a Wikimania event,

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:52.620
 which is for lots of Wikipedians and lots of editors and things like that. And it was in London

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:59.820
 last year. Yes. And Dan was doing a speech about Wikipedia and did you make a page on the

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:04.300
 train? Yeah, so yeah, because one of the speakers at it, who's a comedian here in London and

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:09.100
 scientists called Steve Cross, who runs a think called science show off, he came on and he,

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:13.740
 his whole talk was about how he didn't have a Wikipedia page. And you made one for him?

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:18.620
 No, I knew that he wasn't notable enough to make a Wikipedia page. That's what the problem was

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:23.420
 that he was saying that he can't get one. So what I made was one of those list pages and the list

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:27.980
 was called the title of the page was people who don't have Wikipedia pages. And I put him as the

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:35.260
 first name and they deleted it within a minute. So can I read you just, I have one more thing about this,

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:41.660
 which is that what I really, really like about the guy, Mr. Henderson. And I think, yeah, I mean,

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:46.940
 I quite like his mission. I wouldn't do it myself, but it's quite, it's quite sweet in a way.

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:50.860
 I think it's sloppy English, I don't necessarily think it's wrong. But the first edit he made was on

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:59.260
 the 14th of August 2006, which was for the article central processing unit. Right? Now the next one he made,

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:04.380
 I think he made some other Wikipedia edits in between, but the next one he made for comprised of was

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:11.340
 on the 4th of January 2007. So that's about that's about four months difference. I just wonder what he

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:18.700
 did in that four months. He must have been thinking about it. Yeah, I'm glad I did that. I'll just do one more.

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:23.660
 Just one. I've done one. I'll do another one. There probably aren't too many more. There was a point

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:28.860
 where he had dealt with all of them, every single one on Wikipedia. And then of course, because people

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:35.020
 write more articles and I guess also people get a bit proprietary or sometimes about their articles or

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:40.060
 articles that they've been editing a lot. And so if he changes it and they change it back, he tries not

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:44.380
 to immediately correct that again because he doesn't want to get on with his nerve. So that I think

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:50.140
 wasn't quite a friendly. And the other one, the other one that he has is that obviously if you

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:55.420
 are quoting someone and they've used the words comprised of, you can't change that, that just sits

00:15:55.420 --> 00:16:00.460
 there. And so he gets frustrated. He found like 150. My favorite thing about this fact is that

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:06.620
 our show no such thing as a fish has a Wikipedia page in which all of our facts are put up on Wikipedia.

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:10.540
 And now there's going to be 151 because this will now be a quote that he can't change.

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:15.660
 Oh yeah. We're putting comprised of into our Wikipedia page because it's a fact that we've just said.

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:20.220
 Oh that's so cruel. And it's so cruel because it's a fact that that's going to have his name in it as well.

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:21.580
 Hi Brian. Hi Brian.

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:28.300
 Okay time for fact number three. And that is James Harkin.

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:34.140
 My fact is that the world's largest saw is used to cut through mountains in Kazakhstan.

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:36.220
 Why are they cutting through mountains in Kazakhstan?

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:41.500
 Mining. They're just mining for coal. Yeah they're looking for coal. It's a very impressive looking

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:46.780
 machine. It's terrifying actually. It looks just like a circular saw, only lots bigger. Do you know

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:55.660
 how big it is? Yeah it's 145 feet in diameter and it weighs 45,000 tons. And it just basically

00:16:55.660 --> 00:17:02.140
 anything in its path just gets sold out of the way. Can they change the axis of it so that it can

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:07.980
 cut at an angle? I don't know. I don't think they can. Because you'd be very frustrated if the thing

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:14.060
 you wanted was horizontal and you could only cut vertically. You probably can move it but it is

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:19.180
 really really really heavy. Well it takes like 27 people to operate it right? Yeah. Yeah. So you've got one

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:24.860
 person sitting inside. Apparently that's the prime position. 26 people outside? Yeah. I don't know why.

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:35.340
 It can dig out 4,500 tons of coal an hour. So it weighs 45,000 tons? Yeah. Bloody hell I know.

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:40.540
 That's really heavy. But I just love this like the whole thing of big machinery and stuff.

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:45.660
 Yeah. It's a nice subject. So the world's biggest boring machine. A tunneling as in boring.

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:51.580
 Yeah. And it's under, they're using it to make a tunnel in Seattle at the moment and it's got stuck.

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:57.180
 So it's stuck underneath Seattle. Oh no. That would be a great sequel to sleepless insia.

00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:03.980
 I read the other day that Birmingham University has a bunch of disused tunnels under it which were built

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:09.100
 in 1902 for mining students so they could practice mining. So they're fake mining tunnels.

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:13.420
 Wow. Isn't that cool? Do you think they built it only a little bit underground? Because obviously it

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:17.660
 would be a massive amount of effort to build a fake mining tunnel. Yeah they were. 200 feet down.

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:20.940
 Yeah. I think we only went about 20 feet down or something. I have a cool fact about mines.

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:27.500
 The very deepest mines you can't go down in just one lift because the weight of the cable

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:33.420
 is so much that it would snap when when you were in the capsule at the bottom of the cable.

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:37.260
 So you have to go down and then get another lift even further down. That's how deep into the

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:43.260
 ground. Wow. It's also true of like super towers as well because I know I've been up some of the

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:47.500
 tallest towers in the world and you always are on more than one lift there. Definitely in the

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:57.260
 Kuala Lumpur. Yeah but there are two towers there so obviously you're going to have to do this. No sorry.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:04.140
 I have a thing about cables which is that Alaskan whales use cables like fishing rods

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:09.180
 and fishing lines to eat their fish. What? Which is really interesting. I saw this in the

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:12.860
 documentary the other day. So these fishermen go out and they throw these huge cables down

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:16.700
 into the bottom of the ocean and they attach the side of it on hooks all these big fish.

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:21.500
 And so bigger fish come and latch onto and start eating it and the whales have worked out that if

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:26.300
 you slide down this cable with your mouth open you can eat all the fish so when they come up it's

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:31.820
 half eaten fish. So they go fishing now. These Alaskan whales go fishing. Yeah it's really a very

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:37.180
 cool look. They've got all this documentary footage. Back to sauce quickly. Do you guys know where

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:43.820
 the chainsaw was first invented? For childbirth wasn't it? Yeah I think it was all for, so it was in

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:49.420
 1783 I think and it was just a little hand version of a chainsaw, hand-held version of a chainsaw

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:56.780
 and yeah it was for symphysiotomy which is a surgical procedure where you cut the cartilage to

00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:03.340
 wipe in the pelvis when a woman's giving birth. So it's nice and to cut bones generally. So they were

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:07.660
 really useful in surgery in the 19th century weren't they? They were many used by doctors to cut

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:12.380
 to amputate bones. It was called saw bones. That was an England for a doctor. I was looking at a list

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:21.100
 of different saws and there was, I know it wasn't one saw two saw three. Apparently there is a saw

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:27.580
 called a cold saw. Really? That's great. It's quite nice. Do you know what it does? Is it cooled down

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:33.180
 to cut through hot things or is it? It's basically transfers the heat to the thing that it cuts so the

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:38.540
 actual saw itself doesn't get too hot. That's pretty clever. But the thing you've stored into is

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:45.740
 freaking boilers on fire. Hey so I was looking into mountains. Can I bring into mountains very quickly?

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:53.660
 I found the smallest mountain in the world. Because I just thought there must be one right? There must be

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:58.220
 the smallest mountain. I thought you had to be a certain number of feet to be a mountain. Okay so this

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:05.020
 one is officially registered as a mountain. It's in Australia and it's called Mount Wichiproof.

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:10.860
 It's actually an aboriginal word which is two words which she and pork and it means grass on a hill

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:17.740
 and it totally makes sense because when you look at this it's the smallest mountain. It's 141 feet high.

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:22.460
 So why is it claiming to be a mountain? It's just it's just registered as a mountain. It qualifies as a

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:27.820
 mountain. I mean I guess a mountain must start at some height and that's the smallest. That's where it

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:32.140
 starts. Oh that's the other. No that's it is. 141 feet is where the mountain starts. It starts at

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:36.220
 something like 600 meters. But I think that it's one of those things like the definition of a county

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:40.620
 which is quite fluid. I think you can get registered as a mountain by various dodgy.

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:47.820
 Australia got an internet registry mountain server. I think it was a black market. You know I got

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:53.820
 my license in an hour or nine. Like a Gillian McKee mountain. It's just $200 Australian dollars.

00:21:53.820 --> 00:22:04.860
 Register yourself. We will mount it. This is my cat who is a mountain. Mr. Tibbles, many people have

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:10.540
 tried scaling him but died in the attempts. Yeah there is a rule about how high they are in the UK

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:15.580
 which is why that movie, the man who went up a hill and came down a mountain. The best you

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:19.740
 grant movie ever made. Is that what it's about? It's about the registration of mountains. It's about

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:27.900
 him making the hill very slightly bigger than it was a mountain. It's really sad you watch the film

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:31.580
 and it's one of those films. It reminded me of rabbit pre-fence because you follow Hugo on this

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:34.860
 struggle to turn and say the gem mountain by adding a part of rocks to it or something. I can't

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:38.460
 remember. And then the little right up at the end which tells you what happened afterwards because

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:42.540
 I think it's based on a true story says a few years later it was then reclassified as a hill again.

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:49.420
 Sorry. Is that really what the film's about? Yeah. Wow. I don't know. I thought you were just

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:54.940
 running because I knew the title of the film but I just I just couldn't possibly believe that that

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:59.500
 was what it was about. Basically he grant goes up this hill and then goes on the internet and buys

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:06.860
 wait so why does he add rocks because it's just missing out on a high hill. Yeah it was like one meter

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:11.020
 shot of being a mountain. Why did he want to make it a mountain? Because the village was all proud of

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:15.980
 it. You've got to watch the film. It was a very touching kind of local story film. Okay and he's got

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:27.580
 weirdly floppy straight hair. That's awful. I'm sure it's very. Okay time for a final

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:33.980
 fact. The show and that is Hesinski. My fact is that in the early days of race walking or speed

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:41.420
 walking the competitors were allowed to jog as necessary to relieve cramp. As in could they jog

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:45.660
 forward or would they have to jog on the spot? So it's uncle I think they could jog forward. So it seems

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:51.100
 to have been more of a gentlemanly thing to do was to admit when you didn't have cramp and therefore

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:57.900
 walk and the understood rule was a fair heel and toe which as you can imagine is you have to have

00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:03.580
 your toe on the ground at the same time as your heel of the other foot hits the ground. There was one

00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:09.820
 football team. It was the one that WC Grace played for and whenever they got a penalty they always

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:13.180
 deliberately missed the penalty because they couldn't believe that the other team would deliberately

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:20.940
 do it very well. That's great. Race walking. Yeah you were saying about the pedestrianism.

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:28.140
 Yeah so pedestrianism was where we got the sport speed walking and it started with British footman

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:33.500
 in the 16th 17th centuries and it became a kind of a thing that gentleman like to do is compete over

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:38.300
 how good their footman was or footman obviously had to walk next to a carriage. That's also a good

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:42.220
 way that sport used to be where you didn't have to do it yourself you could get your slaves to

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:47.820
 do it. Exactly and it was like a big gambling thing as you can imagine what bets were placed on

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:52.620
 these people. Anyway Britain and the early 19th century and the most popular in America and the

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:58.940
 late 19th they think and they were pretty easy going rule wise. I really like the the notion that

00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:03.660
 because they would do these walks which lasted for six days that's how the competitions were.

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:08.060
 Yeah they would start on Sunday at midnight basically. Wait so this is the original. This is

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:12.940
 what you were trying to do sport. So just to put this in context as well so this was in the late 1800s

00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:19.740
 it suddenly became the big sport in America. People were dying to see people walk. The story that I read

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:24.620
 which is from a book that you got this fact from right which is a pedestrianism by Matthew Algeo or

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:31.420
 Algeo came out last year. Yeah so from what I read it is that it kind of started as a craze when a person

00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:36.140
 had a bet with someone else about who was going to win the presidential election and the loser of

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:43.500
 the bet had to walk all the way to the inauguration and that was a 10 day walkably from Boston to Washington

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:49.980
 DC and Lincoln won the election and this guy lost his bet. He did the walk and it got such press that

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:54.220
 all these people came to watch it and he had such a success that he kind of just went and it was a

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:59.420
 line that I read it which I loved it said let's take this indoors and he started walking around a

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:04.060
 rink and he started making money for it and then it turned into this big sport where everyone started

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:09.420
 competing and he ended up using the original Madison Square Garden and huge crowds came in to watch

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:14.540
 the thing because people they want to have had cars in those days presumably so people would walk

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:19.740
 from miles around to see other people walking but they walked through from what I read in this book

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:25.900
 21 hours a day for six days it's amazing it's insane and they had a cot on the side that they would

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:32.220
 take naps in which must have been really hard with the thousands of screaming cheers and the yeah

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:36.140
 but yeah and they would cover about 600 miles I think in the six days so about a hundred miles a day

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:41.660
 but if they were racing as well I do love those naps as the kind of like the formula one that stops yeah

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:45.340
 yeah but you'd go in and have a three hour nap and then you'd wake up and be like oh I'm still

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:50.380
 two laps ahead while you and I think people would come in and change your things very very slowly

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:56.700
 change your diapers yeah because presumably you'd have to go to the bathroom at times yeah I wonder

00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:00.780
 what you do there presumably there was a toilet there like a pottedoo and they just have to be in the

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:07.740
 camp yeah maybe in the middle of the the camp that's why they only really stayed in there for about three

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:11.580
 hours the motivation to get out and get back walking I think you should ever have children then

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:18.780
 I very much admire marathon walkers and runners for their ability to just have a shit and a piss

00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:24.220
 wherever they go damn like like what was Paul uh right yeah I think that I wouldn't have dedicated

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:28.060
 to the sport I think you don't really care about that kind of thing that's what I mean it's true

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:33.420
 the newborn babies are the most dedicated sports athletes I was just going to say the guy

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:37.020
 that Dan was talking about is called Edward Payson Western and yeah so they did have it before

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:41.660
 because it was very popular in Britain in in the same kind of format in the early 19th century but

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:47.420
 yeah he was the first big star of it I think and he I think I've been also the first case or one

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:53.340
 of the first cases of a doping scandal uh because he got in trouble for winning a race under the

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:58.140
 influence of coca leaves which was not actually against the rules but it was thought to be again

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:03.100
 very unsportsman like and people were really upset his outright cheating um he admitted that he

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:08.620
 used the coca leaves in the race in 1876 but he said he it was under the advice of his doctor and so

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:14.220
 perfectly okay we all use that excuse when found with cocaine at work um do you know what the first

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:22.220
 doping offence and the Olympics was was it in ancient Greece wasn't was it was in alcohol yeah

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:27.740
 and the first one two beers and it was a guy I think it was in shooting yeah it was in the shooting

00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:32.540
 and he had two beers to calm his nerves yeah and they said that wasn't allowed so it's great of all

00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:37.820
 the sports to be drunk and do most dangerous for the spectators so there's one more thing about that

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:42.300
 guy western who walked to the White House he didn't make it in time for the inauguration

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:48.300
 he was several hours late and then president and he met president Lincoln and Lincoln um he went

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:53.500
 to the first party at the White House and president Lincoln offered to pay his train fare back to Boston

00:28:53.500 --> 00:29:02.300
 and he said no I didn't make it so I'll walk back yeah oh my god is it fantastic that's true

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:09.660
 do you know who popularized or who was the first recreational um client sort of climber rock climber

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:15.900
 until climber in Britain no no I don't it was twiggy I was gonna say twiggy that's so weird yeah

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:20.060
 Jenny only was going to say twiggy because it gets trees on mountains it's a natural name it sounds

00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:25.260
 it's a Christopher walkin oh very nice thank you because he's climbing what about oh climb

00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:31.100
 rock Hudson yeah that's good the rock kid rock you got to go older though I think okay stop being

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:38.140
 silly boys okay right uh it was code of rich oh he's so he is it because the word ridges in his name

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:43.260
 actually there you go we shouldn't we see if we kept going we would have gone to it

00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:50.300
 you say silly oh Kohler has made the first recorded recreational mountain climb in the UK um and

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:53.900
 he was like this right yeah he was the first recorded person to climb up Scarfell Pike which is

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:58.940
 the highest mountain in England and uh yeah and apparently he took an extremely dangerous route

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:07.020
 down and nearly died uh he I know some things about him he uh liked eating fruit while it was still on

00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:15.900
 the tree yeah okay and he wore this huge gown which had stars and crescent moons all over it and it

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:22.460
 made him look like a wizard wow yeah you sure you're thinking of him yeah I think I've dumbledore again

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:30.940
 okay I want to do some FAQs from the race walking associations website go on before we finish yeah

00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:39.180
 okay so the second question on there is why not simply run fair it's a good question isn't it yeah

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:44.300
 I can't think of an answer and their answer is running is certainly faster but one of the interests of

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:50.380
 the spot is achieving good performances within the restrictions of the rules that's true I mean

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:55.340
 that's like saying oh netball why not just let them go all over the court what does that's a different

00:30:55.340 --> 00:31:01.340
 sport yes very good why not let them play football yeah why not just pick up the ball this should have

00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:05.420
 been the real answer to the FAQ what you guys are saying right now yeah sure and why don't we just

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:10.540
 rob everything wouldn't that be easier than earning money into buy things why is there anything

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:18.300
 rather than nothing thanks Einstein you need rules idiot another question yeah it's one more um

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:27.580
 do people not make fun of you when you're race walking it can't be denied that there are some

00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:34.860
 idiots usually overweight people in cars who think that race walking looks funny

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:42.780
 um don't take them on unless you're a judo expert or a lawyer they're usually driving too fast

00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:51.260
 be to catch them anyway don't try chaser but you'll be disqualified with the rules section unless

00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:57.980
 you've got cramp then you can go yeah anyway I've got to go take a shit in the streets because why not
