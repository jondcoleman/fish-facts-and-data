00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 [phone ringing]

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 [indistinct chatter]

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 [music playing]

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 [music playing]

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 [music playing]

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 Hi, Andy.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 Hi, guys.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 We're all wearing coloured shirts today.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 Finally, my memos have been listening to you.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 [laughing]

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 Filming it has just changed us.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 Honestly, it was the last shirt I had available.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 Oh, okay.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 Tomorrow, for me.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 I'm down to three shirts because I jokingly sort of said.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 Yeah, because I said I'm going to throw out my entire wardrobe and start again.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 And Finella took that seriously.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 And I came home a few days ago.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 It was all over the lawn.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 [laughing]

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 Did you cut through your ties as well?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 It's something we're just happening.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 Yeah.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 Anyway, I'm staying down the road.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 But it's down with that bitch.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 [laughing]

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 Oh, my God.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 [laughing]

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 Welcome to drop us in.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 [laughing]

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 Welcome to drop us a line.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 Our audience feedback show.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 We've been receiving your emails.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 And now we're going to give them back to you.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 I've completely forgotten how to introduce this show.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 This is the quickest time to cry.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 Absolutely.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 That you've achieved on this show.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 No time to cry more.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 Yeah, I cry with laughter in every episode.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 If you're watching at home, you'll notice we've been able to see me crying with laughter.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 So, apologies about that.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 But now I've got it out of the way.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 I'm sure it won't happen again.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 Yeah.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 We'll not be funny again.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 Absolutely.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 So, thank you so much for all your emails.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 To podcast@QI.com.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 The inbox is bulging.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 And it's been a terrific fortnight in the inbox.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 We've had some good stuff.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 Great, great.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 Yeah. Should we twoparl it?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 Let's get in. Let's do it.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 All right.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 Andres Kut says,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 "As an Estonian,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 it's already going international.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 Really exciting.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 I was appalled by your blatant discussion of sounders

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 in episode 609.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 Oh.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 I'd imagine people in Finland throwing literal fits.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 What was the context?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 Pissing on the stones.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 Okay, so this is Amy Gladhill.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 Yep.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 Came on the show.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 And she said that on a sauna,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 I think in Leeds,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 there was a side saying,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 "Do not piss on the coals."

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 Yes.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 Yep.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 Well, Andres says,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 "Peeing on the stones,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 brackets not the coals,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 is one of the most awful things you could do in a sauna."

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 I think that's the point we were trying to get.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 Yeah, we weren't saying it was a good idea.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 Yeah.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 I hope not.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 I hope not.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 I hope like everyone who listens to the show hasn't got away

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 and peed on the coals.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 The only reason it's not a proverb is that it's too disgusting

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 of a thought to propagate.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 It is by no means harmless.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 The stench is awful

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 and you pretty much need to replace the stones.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 Once it sets in the wood,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 you kind of need to rep the whole thing down.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 Oh, dear.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 So, this is someone who's experienced.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 Yeah, it feels like we've opened up something.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 So, I'm really sorry, Andres.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 Thank you very much for telling us.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 Yeah.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 So, yeah.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 No, absolutely.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 Big sauna culture, isn't it?

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 It is.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 Yeah, but he's from Estonia.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 And I know Estonia and it has a synchia basically

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 a 200 yards away from each other,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 but they're still there.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 Estonia threw away, aren't they?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 Brilliant.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 Wow.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 applause.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 Let's stop the show.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 See you next time.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 Why?

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 There is short boat ride away from each other.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 It's nice.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 Yeah.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 Okay. Brilliant.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 Cool.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 That's true.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 Anyway, thank you, Andres.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 Sorry to everyone in that region.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 Let's keep going.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 Hannah Bevan writes.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 If you are actually choking,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 it is an emergency.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 Don't faff around calling 111.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 This is a lighthearted comment I made

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 off the back of my suggestion

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 to yell into someone's mouth.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 That's right.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 Come out bone.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 If you are a bone.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 Yeah.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 But good news from Hannah.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 A fish bone in your esophagus is not choking.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 Choking is an obstruction of the airway

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 and is an immediate threat to life.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 Okay.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 So you can't get oxygen.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 So that's when you do the abdominal

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 or the heimlich and all of that.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 If you can talk on the phone you want choking,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 but if you have a stuckfish fish bone,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 yes, see a doctor.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 Okay.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 I think don't come to us for medical advice.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 Yeah.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 Yeah.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 Look just generally speaking.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 I think that I would say the only piece

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 of medical advice that we've ever given

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 that is really solid.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 If you have hiccups,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 put your finger up your bum.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 That's really the only one I stand by.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 That's why I was a terrible GP.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 You really got through those disposable gloves, don't you?

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 Drew Eustent.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 Drew Eustent.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 Disposable.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 Brilliant.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 We've had word of,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 I would say the fish messiah being born.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 Right.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 This is so exciting.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 Okay.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 What's that mean?

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 Well, James, you know how you're good

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 at dishing out harkinings and checking facts.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 And you know, you're, I'd say,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 the sort of most pure facty.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 I hesitate to say so after I messed it up last time.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 But yeah.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 I do like to beautifully pick up people.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 Well, there is another.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 A child has been born.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 Who I think might be the next generation.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 Fish the next generation.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 Okay.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 It's my daughter.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 It's not.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 Literally as we were walking home the other day,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 she was like, Danny, did you know that the moon is not a planet?

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 I was like, yeah, I did know that.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 Did you know that the sun is not a planet?

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 Like, she's just got this, did you know?

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 I think going.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 That's great.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 I didn't think so.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 It seems likely.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 She's going to have a rough time growing up saying,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 did you know to you?

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 Because you'll say every time, yes.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 You won't, you won't, you won buckle.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 Yeah, you won't.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 Actually, when she said, did you know that the moon is not a planet?

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 I should have said, oh, really?

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 I was supposed to like, yeah.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 Obviously I did.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 That's a moon.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 Don't ever bring these matters to me again.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 Well, Aislin Fellow's rights.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 I thought you may enjoy the attached PowerPoint presentation created

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 by my eight-year-old daughter, Cersha, for her teacher.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 On the first day of their new topic, Vikings,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 the teacher relayed the usual chat of Viking helmets having horns.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 Oh, wow.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 My daughter attempted to correct her.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 The whole class and the teacher basically told her she was wrong.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 She refused to let this stand.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 And she put together an entire PowerPoint explaining that, no,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 the teacher was wrong about this.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 She sent it over.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 It's a great PowerPoint.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 I'll share a slide on the screen if Aislin doesn't mind.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 We did ask her to remove the original last line of,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 and this is why you're wrong.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 So, she's been forced to wear helmets

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 with horns for a school assembly,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 but she plans to display the helmet in her room with a plaque

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 describing that it's inaccurate.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 So, you know, this is...

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 I know.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 I mean, was that...

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 Would you have done something like that, do you think?

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 I don't think so.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 Right.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 Obviously, yes.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 Anyway, congratulations, Aislin.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 Lovely.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 Very great stuff.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 Yeah.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 Wonderful.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 Here's a little fact about us.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 We've had a bit of audience research done,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 which I really like.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 Scott McKellen from St. Louis, Missouri,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 has studied a sample of a hundred of our episodes.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 Well, it's quite a big sample.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 Yeah.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 Notice of things that first shares an average of one sex fact

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 in 31% of episodes.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 Brackets list-attached.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 That's fewer than I would have thought.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 I agree.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 He's not counting penis mentions.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 Presumably.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 Arguably.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 Arguably, that should be mentioned.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 Yeah.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 I presume that would just make it a hundred percent.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 And it becomes an uninteresting study.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 What period in our life are we talking about here?

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 The last 100.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 The last 100 most recent.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 My criteria was this is talking about a sexual position

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 or a breathing behavior.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 But if I included every time a reproductive system was mentioned,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 it would have topped 50%.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 And there's a list of all the species we've talked about here.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 A lot of them are water-based.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 Orca, starfish.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 Crocodiles.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 And a fish.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 Orpus.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 Barnacles.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 Good point.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 Humans have come up a few times.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 So to speak.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 Wow.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 The rough periwinkle snail.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 Yeah.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 If only we could tell it.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 It had arrived in a list like this.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 It only had the intelligence to understand.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 Made it.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 Made it, mum.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 You're on a list with the Northern Giant mouse lemur.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 Yeah.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 Yeah.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 Is there a conclusion about our interest?

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 Or is it just purely data?

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 It's purely data.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 Yeah.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 I always think if I go on mastermind and had a specialist subject,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 animal sex would be right up there.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 That's a good.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 That's a good idea.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 I feel like there's not much about animal sex

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 that I haven't come across over the years.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 Other words better when you're on mastermind.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 I've started self-finished.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 And there we go.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 That's why we'll keep this email in.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 Brilliant.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 Right.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 We come to our radio climb of the week.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 Okay.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 But it's a really positive one actually this time.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 We've had a lot of emails about climbing from climbers.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 Oh, Alex Honald was our fact.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 Let me guess because I've had quite a lot of people arguing

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 that he doesn't wear sticky shoes.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 He wears climbing shoes.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 Which I have to say I did know I was doing a bet.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 Right.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 I was saying that he wears sticky shoes.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 I actually didn't know that climbers wore sticky shoes

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 until I researched it.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 How sticky?

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 It's really interesting.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 It's just like it's a kind of rubber,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 which is particularly good at adhering surfaces.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 It's not, it's got a very high coefficient of friction.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 That's really interesting.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 It doesn't leave a trail behind him.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 It's not like a snail.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 That's why I got alcapitan.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 Okay.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 Yeah, I got quite a lot of that on my own social medias.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 We do.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 We haven't had much of that.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 You'll be relieved to hear it.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 Because one or two did.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 But Mike Robinson says there's a frozen waterfall in London

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 that you can ice climb.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 Oh, wow.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 What?

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 It's like I've been coven garden.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 What?

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000
 Yeah.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 Not that mountain sharp that's near our old office.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 I think it's the north face.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 Because I've been upstairs and downstairs there.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 And I don't.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000
 I didn't see it.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 No, there's a climbing place.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 And they've got a frozen waterfall.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 In coven garden.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 I looked it up.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 That's what it's seeing like.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 Wow.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 I know.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 But there's no mention of where it is in this email.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 He included a link, which I clicked.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 Yeah.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 How deep into the weasel we want to get on this one.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 I think we're asking a basic question.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 Where in coven garden is it?

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 Do you want me to Google it now?

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 We could do it after we could do it after.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 We've got all day.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 Yeah.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 It's your own time.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 You're wasted.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 Or right in if you know where it is.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 It's podcast at qi.com.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 You can't hang that over my head.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 You can't recognize this.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 We can't weaponize this at all.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 Okay.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 Right.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 Andrew says.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 Just Andrew.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 Do you want to guess what the screaming bar fees are when you're doing ice climbing?

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 He's an avid rock ice climber in western Canada.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 We're such an international show.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 Very cool.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 Screaming the screaming bar fees.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 It must be something to do with on it.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 Like bar.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 Yeah.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 It's something that makes you throw up when you're doing an ice climb.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 Is it something to do with your ears not working?

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 So you get off balance.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 So I was thinking like a wind, a type of wind that comes in through a crack.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 I can't relay it around your head.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 Quite.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 I'll tell you what it is.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 During a long cold climb, if you grip your ice axes too tight, your hands can go a little numb.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 But if you lower your hands and relax, the blood quickly rushes in too fast.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 And the pain in your hands is such that people will start either screaming or on occasion throwing up.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 All this while partway up a frozen waterfall.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 In Copenhagen.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 It was in Canada.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 But yeah, I mean, it's stunning.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 Like, amazing what people do for fun, isn't it?

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 I just don't think it's a massively good idea.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 I think if I was in TLC, I'd be singing "Don't Go Climbing Waterfalls".

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 That's really good.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 Frozen or not?

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 Yeah.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 Lovely.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 Lovely.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 We might need to stand up and sing National Anthem now, because we're going to House of Lords Corner.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 Okay.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 Lord Borwick of Hawkeshead writes, "Speakers' Corner".

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 You could call it.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 Very good.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 Yeah.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 We've heard from a Lord.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 Yeah.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 This is huge.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 Okay.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 There's a lot of the rats.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 There's a ton of them these days, aren't there?

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 Yeah, there's several hundred.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 Yeah.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 Does the Lord...

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 Does the Lord listen to drop us a line?

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 He listens to fish.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 Right.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
 You don't get this on parenting, are you?

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 No.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 Well, do you know?

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 I don't.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 And I bet it's really good.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 It is.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 You got a top podcast.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 They are.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 The top podcast.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 Yeah.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 That's great.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 Look, Lord Borwick of Hawkeshead writes, "Yes.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 In episode four of Little Fish, you mentioned Daniel McClies, the Irish painter, and his connection

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 with William Sykes and Charles Dickens, and they...

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
 Sykes was a wrongman whose wife had an affair with Daniel McClies.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 Yes, it was your up-to-date hot gossip, wasn't it?

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 And then he uses Sykes in Oliver Twist for Bill Sykes, and there was problems.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 There's an alternate story as to why the two fell out, which I have heard.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 So Lord Borwick is also providing hot gossip.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 Yeah.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 Which is that.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 Sykes, the Lord, was responsible for deciding the pay of painters in the rebuilt houses of Parliament.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 He couldn't agree the price with the painter, McClies, who painted the enormous 50 by 20 foot frescoes

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 in the royal gallery of the House of Lords.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 So, Daniel, the painter, painted lady Sykes into both paintings.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 Oh.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 So the wife of the guy who's paying him.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 Yeah, the wife of the wrongman here.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 Yeah.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 She appears in the Trafalgar painting next to a shot Admiral Nelson, and she appears in the Battle of Waterloo,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 standing there with a glass of wine in both.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 Wow.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 Really?

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 So that's a good sort of sick burn on someone you could do.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 Is it?

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 Put your wife in something?

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 Yeah.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 I'm not sure why it's a sick burn.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 It's quite cool to immortalize your wife.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 Ah, anyway, so thank you, my Lord.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 I don't know if that's the correct term of, um, probably is.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 Hmm.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 Thank you, Lord B of Hawkshead.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000
 Never been to Hawkshead?

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 Anyone know where it is?

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 No.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 Me neither.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 Ian Halliday writes, "Did you know that you can drive from Moscow to California in just one hour?"

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 [laughs]

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 Which Moscow?

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 With the one in Erscher.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 [laughs]

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 And California near Falkirk, both in Scotland.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 I haven't heard of either of those.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 Well, school or California?

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 Yeah.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 So I'm not sure why this is interesting.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 [laughs]

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 You've heard the place in Scotland, though.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 Brilliant.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 Um, Cath Kastner says, "I'm an artist and long time listener of the show.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 And I just had to write him because I was so surprised to hear you mention the sci-fi initiative of the French army."

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 Oh, yes.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 I mentioned that.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 Yeah, they basically had, as far as I can remember, a unit of sci-fi authors who were brought in to predict future warfare, predict, come up with ideas.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 And that was just to them, personally.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 Yeah.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 Good idea.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 But yeah, I don't remember much about it more than that.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 Lots of much sci-ops as sci-fi-ops.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 Mmm, lovely.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 Well, Cath just answers the question that we raised in the episode, but I don't think we answered.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 It's still very much a thing.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 How is it?

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 That's cool.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 I've changed their name from red team to radar, but Cath has been working for them, illustrating a book.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000
 No.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 Yeah, I couldn't write in straightaway as I signed an NDA for bidding me to talk about the project before the book came out.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 But she's free now to talk about it and tell us that it's still going.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 Interesting that they name themselves after quite an old bit of technology.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 Good point.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 You think they'd name themselves after something that's coming in 30 years?

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 Yes.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 Yeah, you're right.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 Or do they know something?

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 And we're going to be reduced back to old technology.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 Oh, no.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 That's like that Einstein quotes.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 You know, we said, "I don't know what World War III will be fought with, but I know World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones."

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 Yeah.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 It makes me think.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 She didn't tell us what the book is though.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 She's not allowed to tell us that.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 I think the book is out, so she probably is allowed, but she just didn't.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000
 Okay.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 So we don't know what the book is.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 You didn't Google it?

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 I didn't Google it.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000
 Can you Google it now?

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 Yeah, of course.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 Unless you know at home.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 In which case, email podcast at qi.com.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 I do like receiving all the emails, so it's actually not a threat, guys.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 He said, "I like having my head put down the toilet, actually."

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 So jokes on you, guys.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
 Let's go on to Mike Giggler of the week.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 Yeah.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 Gerard Pethabridge.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 An unbelievably good name.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
 Let's have a moment for Gerard Pethabridge.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 Pethabridge is wonderful.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 Gerard Pethabridge.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 It's like it should be Lord Gerard of Pethabridge.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 It does, doesn't it?

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 Anyway, congratulations, Gerard.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 You're going to the Lords.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 And Gerard writes, "In the most recent episode where the group called Lily Allen,

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 the modern-day Lord Byron."

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 "In the section where you were rattling off similarities."

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 Famous father and all that.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 Someone asked, "Does she have a club foot?"

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 I think it was you, wasn't it?

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 Yeah, and the answer is, "No, Cassavian had a club putt."

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 Brilliant.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 Well, Gerard is here to tell you she does.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 In 2024, Lily started selling feet picks on only fans.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 And much like clubfishes for fish fans,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 Lily's feet fans must surely be her club foot.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 Yes.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 Lovely.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 Very good.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 I didn't know that about her.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 Brilliant.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 I've got an extra diesel, by the way, about Lily Allen,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 which is relevant to the show.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 Yeah.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 So, do you remember how much have you spent on Lily Allen foot picks?

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 Signed.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
 Please.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:21.000
 So, this is why you read the premier in.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 I don't mind you throwing my clothes on the lawn,

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 but please, just a misspeck.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 So, the album was co-written.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 This is a friend of the podcast.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 This is a new album that's just come out.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 Right.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 The album is co-written and co-produced by a producer called Blue May.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 Okay.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 Blue May is a friend of mine.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 He lived here in London.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 He loved fish.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 Okay.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 Do you remember I told a story once.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 I think James, you might have been off,

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 but I told a story once about a sausage dog that has such large dangling testicles.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 That when it walked down the stairs, they banged down the stairs.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 That dog belonged to Blue May, the producer of Lily Allen's album.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 Does she mention it in any of the songs?

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 I think they're quite self-biographical.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 They are.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 I don't think Dave, the sausage dog, was around anymore by the time Lily came onto the scene.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 Wow.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 Yeah.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 So, the producer of Lily Allen's album is a friend of the podcast by his dog.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 Wow.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 Well, that's...

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 Sometimes you don't realise you're famous, like mega-famous.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 And then you just hear something and you realise, wow, we've come a long way.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 We know a book.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 He's got a sausage dog with big balls.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 It's called Dave.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 But he also produced Lily Allen's new albums.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 Yeah.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 Did he use any of the dog-stairball noises in the album?

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 Yeah.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000
 What do you think is a high heart?

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 Is actually...

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 Well, thank you for that.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 That's really cool.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 Yeah.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 Yeah.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 Max Dweck says, "I have one request if at all possible."

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 This is about...

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 Max has become a friend of the podcast on Patreon, where you get to sponsor a fact.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 I'm quite touched by this, so I just thought I mentioned it.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 I know I must be very far down on the custodian fact list.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 I really am sorry.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 We've had a rush.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 We're going to get you all your facts as soon as we can.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 Yeah.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
 That's totally great.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 But it would truly be an honour when it is my turn.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 Could you please assign me not a headline fact.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 But one of Andy's most boring side facts.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 Like me.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 And make it more specific, please.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 Like maybe model railways using coal for coal.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 I love Andy's boring side facts.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.000
 Nice.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 So, thank you, Max.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 I just...

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 I'm really touched by that.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 Yeah.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 So some people like them.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 It's all I'm trying to say.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 Yeah.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 One person.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 Thank you, Max.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 Oh, we like them as well.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 We love them.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 Thank you.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 That's why you're here.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 And luckily, there will be plenty of headline facts that fill that criteria from Andy.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 So...

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 It's not just the side facts.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 It's not the side facts.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 Sorry, Max.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 Okay.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 Okay.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 Okay.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 Luke McNeil writes.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 Uh-huh.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 In a recent Listen to Call in Episode.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 Oh, so this was a drop as a line.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 It might have been last drop as a line, but one.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 Okay.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.400
 Andy mentioned his idea for a movie about a Ragtag group of world record holders defeating

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.400
 criminals or terrorists.

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.400
 And the final climactic moments depend on the Guinness record keepers stopwatch ability.

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:28.400
 Yes.

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.400
 Right?

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:30.400
 Cast your minds back.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.400
 We've had some titles in.

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.400
 Oh, great.

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:35.400
 Because don't know.

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.400
 Was the first suggestion.

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:38.400
 Yeah.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.400
 Hall of oddities or holers, something like that was another one.

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:42.400
 Something.

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.400
 I don't really remember this very well.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.400
 Well, it was about the Guinness.

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:46.400
 I was about...

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.400
 You've explained what it is, but.

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:51.400
 Andy's dream led to a plot that we hashed out on the show.

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:54.400
 I woke up with an idea for a major franchise.

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.400
 Yeah.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.400
 Well, Luke McNeil has the title.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:00.400
 It's second hand heroes.

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.400
 This works on so many levels.

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:05.400
 For one, the heroes in question are not exactly who you would think of as heroes.

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:09.400
 Also, second hand obviously refers to the second hand of the stopwatch.

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.400
 Oh.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.400
 Okay, I think it's just those two levels.

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:13.400
 It's a good title though.

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.400
 Nice.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.400
 Whereas Troy Holland.

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:19.400
 A very amazing two place name.

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:21.400
 A person name.

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:23.400
 Only one of the mechston.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:24.400
 Yeah, true.

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:29.400
 Troy Holland says, "I think the movie should be called Try Hard."

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:31.400
 Which is not to die hard.

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:34.400
 Because it's the plot of die hard, which we're being upfront about.

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:35.400
 Right.

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.400
 I like it.

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:40.400
 And also, most Guinness world record holders surely try hard in their record attempts.

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:41.400
 Oh, yeah.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.400
 I did get that from the first three minutes.

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:44.400
 Sorry, I didn't.

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.400
 Until I got to that sentence in the email.

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:50.400
 If he ever writes a memoir, "Troy Hard" will be a great title.

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.400
 Oh my god.

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:53.400
 Yeah.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:54.400
 I love it.

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.400
 I'm a university challenge when people get an answer right.

00:22:56.400 --> 00:23:01.400
 Do you know they often pick up a glass of water and just congratulate themselves.

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.400
 I love how you just did that down after that joke.

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:05.400
 I have to be careful because I'm running out of water.

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:10.400
 These puns are not going to stop any time soon.

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:12.400
 It's because you know the applause break.

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.400
 It's coming.

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.400
 Yeah, that's it, isn't it?

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.400
 Yeah.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.400
 All right.

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:19.400
 Let's have something about space now.

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:20.400
 Okay.

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:22.400
 The final frontier.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:27.400
 This is the log of Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.400
 What we're doing, astronaut's logs actually.

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.400
 Oh, no.

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:34.400
 Because Aiden Kotter writes in with facts about astronauts going to the moon space.

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.400
 Which we did on Little Fish, didn't we?

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.400
 Yeah, we know.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.400
 Yes.

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:38.400
 That's all right.

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:43.400
 We were sent in a fact about the ISS having you're able to tell how much urine is in the urine tank.

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:45.400
 The P-tank blue sky account.

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:46.400
 That's right.

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:47.400
 38 percent.

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:48.400
 38.

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:49.400
 Yes.

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:54.600
 Well, Aiden's just following up with a little bit of information because there are some amazing

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:58.400
 stuff about these missions.

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:02.400
 So obviously it's, we is much easier to do with them poo.

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.400
 Oh, yeah.

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:08.400
 But where you can just put on some sauna calls.

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.400
 Well, okay.

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:16.400
 During the Apollo and Gemini missions, the NASA teams gave the first men on the moon bags

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.400
 to go into.

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.400
 Yeah.

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.400
 They did know that.

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:24.400
 But what I didn't know is that in zero gravity there is a problem with achieving separation.

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:25.400
 Oh.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:26.400
 You see what I mean?

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:30.400
 So the poo, you might, you might be pooing.

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:38.400
 Oh, so it's like you know those plasticine things where you feed the plasticine in and it comes out in a shape.

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.400
 Yeah.

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.400
 And then you cut the plasticine off.

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.400
 So you get your sausage.

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.400
 You have to.

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:44.400
 You have to.

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:49.400
 So the NASA designed bags with special finger compartments to allow.

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:50.400
 Wow.

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.400
 A astronauts in question two.

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:53.400
 Does your Sphinx and I'll do that.

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:54.400
 No.

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.400
 I thought, yeah, can you not do a bum squeeze to finish it?

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:57.400
 God.

00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:58.400
 I'm sorry.

00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.400
 I brought this up.

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.400
 But it's, I think it doesn't flee.

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:03.400
 It doesn't flee from you the way it normally does on Earth.

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:04.400
 Oh, I see.

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:05.400
 So it wasn't, it was cut.

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:06.400
 But it wouldn't.

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:07.400
 I'm afraid so.

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.400
 You know, you know, it's not enough.

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:12.400
 It's not enough push that when you get it out.

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:13.400
 Sorry if you're eating.

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:18.400
 It does feel like you would even because there's no friction in space.

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.400
 One squeeze.

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.400
 Yeah.

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:23.400
 It would go away and then it would just continue on its way into deep space.

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:24.400
 In space.

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:25.400
 No one can hear you squeeze.

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:26.400
 Yeah.

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:31.400
 Or if it just hangs it, could you fart and the air propellate?

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.400
 I wonder if it's strong enough to propel it.

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.400
 A single fart because there is talk about astronauts farting to propel themselves.

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:37.400
 That is not strong enough.

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:43.400
 There is talk on the website that goes to.

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:51.400
 What briefing paper stated this got to in NASA?

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.400
 Is talk.

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:53.400
 I love that.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.400
 Anyway.

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:58.400
 So thank you, Aidan, for that disgusting fact.

00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:59.400
 That's great.

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:00.400
 Yeah.

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:01.400
 That's great.

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:02.400
 So, okay.

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.400
 Two fingers as part of a plastic bag that you can thumb presumably.

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:07.400
 I don't know if it's all fingers.

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:08.400
 I haven't.

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:09.400
 You might as well do.

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:10.400
 There's no point having like mittens.

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:13.400
 You might as well have all their fingers available.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:14.400
 Yeah.

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.400
 Shittons, you could call them.

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:16.400
 Yes.

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:18.400
 Tag me your water.

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:22.400
 Let's have some of the non-determ.

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.400
 Oh.

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:24.400
 Let's go to non-determ, Ali.

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:32.400
 Kevin McGillivre says there is a 15 year old chess grandmaster from Iran whose name is

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:33.400
 Sinah.

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:35.400
 Move ahead.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.400
 Sinah.

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:37.400
 Move ahead.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:38.400
 He's a move ahead.

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:39.400
 Sinah move ahead.

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:40.400
 That's very good.

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:41.400
 That's stunning.

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:42.400
 Yeah.

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.400
 That's good.

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:44.400
 Never heard of him.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.400
 That's really.

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:46.400
 That's quite creepy non-determinism.

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:47.400
 Yeah.

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:48.400
 That's.

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:49.400
 Hang on.

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:54.400
 Harry not writes in about Adele Acta.

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:58.400
 Just wondering at what age Adele Acta realized he'd be an ideal actor.

00:26:58.400 --> 00:26:59.400
 He's an actor.

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:00.400
 Yeah.

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.400
 Incredible.

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:02.400
 He's an actor.

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.400
 Yep.

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:04.400
 Great.

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:09.400
 Ross Harvey says, the press secretary for the Reagan administration was named Larry Speaks.

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:14.400
 Press secretary, which makes him both a sentence person and an example of nominative determinism.

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.400
 Oh, that's good.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:16.400
 Yeah.

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:17.400
 Is that brilliant?

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:18.400
 Yeah.

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:20.400
 We have to go back briefly to the nulla ball plane.

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:21.400
 Oh, no.

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:28.280
 In a section we're now calling nulla balls.

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:33.280
 Can I say I think there's a chance one day we might go back to Australia for a tour.

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:34.280
 Yeah.

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:36.280
 If you guys want us to come, we'll come.

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:37.280
 Yeah.

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:44.280
 And I would love to do a gig, a gig in the nulla ball plane.

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:48.280
 In the 500 miles of nothing in every direction.

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:49.280
 I would be good.

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:50.280
 That would be great.

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:51.280
 I'm up for it.

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:52.280
 That would be awesome.

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:53.280
 Yeah.

00:27:53.280 --> 00:28:00.280
 Well, Mike Cowley is a former West Australian civil engineer and isn't writing about how you

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:02.280
 say the word nulla ball.

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:08.280
 He does include that as part of his email, but there's a thing amazing thing about road trains.

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:09.280
 Right.

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:10.280
 Which is this.

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:11.280
 You know, you get a huge.

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:13.280
 You've got a big semi on the front.

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:15.280
 And you've got a lot of characters on the back.

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:16.280
 Yeah.

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:18.280
 Trailers and all that.

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:23.280
 But this is a fantastic tiny extra bonus fact that I think probably only a former West Australian

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:25.280
 civil engineer would know.

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:26.280
 Okay.

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:28.280
 So he's from Perth.

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:31.280
 Like almost everyone in West Australia.

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:36.280
 Geometric rose design is typically completed using the Ostrodes guide to road design part

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:37.280
 three.

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:38.280
 Okay.

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:40.280
 You've already got Andy.

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:41.280
 He's hooked.

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:43.280
 You had me.

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:50.280
 No design.

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:59.280
 I'm flying a fighter jet right now.

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:01.280
 I'm part of this process.

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:02.280
 It's the calculation.

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:08.280
 I promise this is good of the site stopping distances, which take into account vehicle speed road surface

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:10.280
 road grade and reaction time.

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:11.280
 Yeah, sure.

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:14.280
 You had to learn that for your highway code in back in the day.

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:22.280
 And the reaction time is selected by the engineer based on road conditions slash drivers circumstances.

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:24.280
 So the engineer is building the road.

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:28.280
 Maybe a Len B Del or similar.

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:33.280
 You use either a reaction time of 1.5 seconds, two seconds or two and a half.

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:39.280
 And there's this tiny note in Ostrodes guide to road design part three, which says reaction

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:45.280
 time of 1.5 seconds, that's the fastest, cannot be used in Western Australia.

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:50.280
 A 1.5 second reaction time is owned to be used in constrained situations where drivers will be alert.

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:54.280
 The general minimum reaction time is two seconds.

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:58.280
 And Mike writes, there is no reason Western Australia should be treated differently.

00:29:58.280 --> 00:29:59.280
 It's not regional Western Australia.

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:00.280
 It's all of it.

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:05.280
 The only conclusion I can fathom is we take just a fraction of a moment longer to do things over here.

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:07.280
 It's just a slower pace of life.

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:12.280
 Not because there is lots of featureless land.

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:18.280
 And so you kind of kind of dose off a little bit and your reaction times are worse.

00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:20.280
 That's a very good theory.

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:22.280
 It doesn't explain why.

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:24.280
 It's maybe ungoogleable.

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:28.280
 Thank you so much, Mike Cowley for that barnstormer of an email.

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:31.280
 Great little spot of a tiny, tiny detail.

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:33.280
 I think that's why I liked it so much.

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:38.280
 I'm a former Western Australian road engineer.

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:40.280
 That gets me going.

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:41.280
 That pumps me up.

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:42.280
 Should we have last one?

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:43.280
 Last one.

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:44.280
 Let's do it.

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:47.280
 Dan, you like saying things about yourself on the show.

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:48.280
 Okay.

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:50.280
 You reveal things about yourself, don't you?

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:51.280
 Yeah.

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:53.280
 If I think of something that's relevant to the chat, I'll pop it in.

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:54.280
 Yeah.

00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:56.280
 But you don't keep yourself secret.

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:57.280
 No.

00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:58.280
 You know, I do.

00:30:58.280 --> 00:30:59.280
 I'm very private.

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:00.280
 And you're much more open, I'd say.

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:01.280
 Okay.

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:02.280
 And James, you're somewhere in the middle.

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:03.280
 Yeah.

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:08.280
 I think, especially in the little fish, we're all revealing ourselves a little bit more.

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:09.280
 That's true.

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:10.280
 than we ever have before.

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:13.280
 But what I do wonder is where the fuck you're going with this?

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:20.280
 I can't think of where.

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:27.280
 I can't think of where.

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:28.280
 I can't think of where.

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:32.280
 I'm not even playing at being innocent, I genuinely.

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:34.280
 I don't know what you're trying to get.

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.280
 We're such an unusual start to a bit.

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:37.280
 I guess you're right.

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:38.280
 It was weird.

00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:40.280
 It was weird of me to say.

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:46.280
 Basically, we've had a fact from something we said on little fish about celebrities who give out

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:47.280
 their personal phone number.

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:48.280
 Oh, yeah.

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:49.280
 Yeah.

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:50.280
 Patsy Clien.

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:51.280
 Patsy Clien.

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:52.280
 Yeah.

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:53.280
 At Laurel Hardy.

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:54.280
 Yes.

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:55.280
 Stan Laurel.

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:56.280
 Yes.

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:57.280
 That's right.

00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:02.280
 And then about the former T-Shock of Ireland, Ender Kenny.

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:03.280
 Oh, yeah.

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:06.280
 Not that long ago though.

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:07.280
 Not that long ago.

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:08.280
 No.

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:12.280
 Who was replaced by Leo Veracca and Olivia just right.

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:17.280
 She remembers a conversation with her politics teacher where she was told Ender Kenny was so prone to giving out

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:22.280
 his personal phone number to anyone who asked that two thirds of Kerry had him in their contacts.

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:24.280
 And I just really like this.

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:26.280
 So she tried to back it up.

00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:27.280
 She tried to do a bit more research.

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:28.280
 Yeah.

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:29.280
 She tried to Google it.

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:32.280
 But it turns out that he has done this loads.

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:33.280
 That's really great.

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:34.280
 Ender Kenny.

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:39.280
 And there's a news article she included the link to where Ender Kenny says his open invitation to global

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:42.280
 business to call him anytime has had some unexpected consequences.

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:44.280
 And he basically told the load of people.

00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:45.280
 Call me anytime.

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:48.280
 And more or less put his number up on the screen.

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:52.280
 And he then said, Christ, I'm getting phone calls from Adelaide and New Zealand and everywhere.

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:54.280
 They're not all about industry.

00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:56.280
 That's really cool.

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:58.280
 Oh, that's really cool.

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:00.280
 Anyway, this is a nice little effect.

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:01.280
 Yeah.

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:02.280
 But Ender Kenny.

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:05.280
 Who I think could be a friend of the podcast you never know with that kind of attitude.

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:06.280
 Friend of Kenny.

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:07.280
 Yeah.

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:08.280
 Friend of Kenny.

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:13.280
 Brilliant.

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:14.280
 All right.

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:15.280
 That's your lot.

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:16.280
 Yeah.

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:17.280
 Great.

00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:18.280
 Good stuff.

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:19.280
 Always good stuff.

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:20.280
 Yeah.

00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:29.280
 I would say at the moment, probably the inbox is a little bit gone.

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:32.280
 The inbox is looking very hollow.

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:33.280
 So what do we need?

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:35.280
 We need emails.

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:36.280
 I see what you're doing there.

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:37.280
 You're helping me.

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:39.280
 You have to be kidding out of this.

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:41.280
 You do need a bit of that.

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:42.280
 You've gone out of it.

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:44.280
 We're bringing you back in.

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:45.280
 Just what I think I'm out.

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:47.280
 It will be right back in.

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:49.280
 No, James is right.

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:50.280
 We need emails.

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:51.280
 We need them urgently.

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:56.280
 If you are a former Western Australian road engineer and you've noticed something funny

00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:58.280
 in "Ost Roads" volume three.

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.280
 If you're flying a fighter jet.

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:02.280
 If you're flying a fighter jet, please send it.

00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:04.280
 I mean, I'll glance at it.

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:10.280
 No, if you have anything to say about anything we've said on any of our 600 episodes,

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:14.280
 40 on drop of the lines and a growing number of little fish, we'd love to hear it.

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:17.280
 We'd love getting emails as we've mentioned once or twice before.

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:20.280
 It's podcast@QI.com.

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:23.280
 And we'll do another one of these in a couple of weeks.

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:25.280
 But until then, it's by from these two.

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.280
 Bye.

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:27.280
 So long.

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:28.280
 It's by from me.

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:30.280
 Oh, I'm afraid it's too wrong.

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:32.280
 There's no one else to say goodbye.

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:34.280
 What about Little Andy?

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:35.280
 What about me?

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:36.280
 What about me?

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:37.280
 What about me?

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:41.280
 It's by quite fun, Governor.

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:46.280
 He doesn't know how to fucking.

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:49.280
 What about even smaller Andy?

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:50.280
 What about me?

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:51.280
 Why?
