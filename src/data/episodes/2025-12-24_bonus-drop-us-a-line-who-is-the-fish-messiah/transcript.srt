00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 [phone ringing]

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 [indistinct chatter]

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 [music playing]

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 [music playing]

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 [music playing]

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Hi, Andy.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Hi, guys.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 We're all wearing coloured shirts today.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 Finally, my memos have been listening to you.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 [laughing]

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Filming it has just changed us.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 Honestly, it was the last shirt I had available.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Oh, okay.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 Tomorrow, for me.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 I'm down to three shirts because I jokingly sort of said.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Yeah, because I said I'm going to throw out my entire wardrobe and start again.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 And Finella took that seriously.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 And I came home a few days ago.

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 It was all over the lawn.

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 [laughing]

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Did you cut through your ties as well?

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 It's something we're just happening.

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Yeah.

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Anyway, I'm staying down the road.

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 But it's down with that bitch.

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 [laughing]

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Oh, my God.

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 [laughing]

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Welcome to drop us in.

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 [laughing]

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Welcome to drop us a line.

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Our audience feedback show.

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 We've been receiving your emails.

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 And now we're going to give them back to you.

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 I've completely forgotten how to introduce this show.

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 This is the quickest time to cry.

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Absolutely.

38
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 That you've achieved on this show.

39
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 No time to cry more.

40
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Yeah, I cry with laughter in every episode.

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 If you're watching at home, you'll notice we've been able to see me crying with laughter.

42
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 So, apologies about that.

43
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 But now I've got it out of the way.

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 I'm sure it won't happen again.

45
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Yeah.

46
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 We'll not be funny again.

47
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 Absolutely.

48
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 So, thank you so much for all your emails.

49
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 To podcast@QI.com.

50
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 The inbox is bulging.

51
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 And it's been a terrific fortnight in the inbox.

52
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 We've had some good stuff.

53
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Great, great.

54
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Yeah. Should we twoparl it?

55
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Let's get in. Let's do it.

56
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 All right.

57
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Andres Kut says,

58
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 "As an Estonian,

59
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 it's already going international.

60
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 Really exciting.

61
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 I was appalled by your blatant discussion of sounders

62
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 in episode 609.

63
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Oh.

64
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 I'd imagine people in Finland throwing literal fits.

65
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 What was the context?

66
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Pissing on the stones.

67
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 Okay, so this is Amy Gladhill.

68
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 Yep.

69
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Came on the show.

70
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 And she said that on a sauna,

71
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 I think in Leeds,

72
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 there was a side saying,

73
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 "Do not piss on the coals."

74
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Yes.

75
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Yep.

76
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 Well, Andres says,

77
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 "Peeing on the stones,

78
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 brackets not the coals,

79
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 is one of the most awful things you could do in a sauna."

80
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 I think that's the point we were trying to get.

81
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Yeah, we weren't saying it was a good idea.

82
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 Yeah.

83
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 I hope not.

84
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 I hope not.

85
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 I hope like everyone who listens to the show hasn't got away

86
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 and peed on the coals.

87
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 The only reason it's not a proverb is that it's too disgusting

88
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 of a thought to propagate.

89
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 It is by no means harmless.

90
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 The stench is awful

91
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 and you pretty much need to replace the stones.

92
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Once it sets in the wood,

93
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 you kind of need to rep the whole thing down.

94
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Oh, dear.

95
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 So, this is someone who's experienced.

96
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Yeah, it feels like we've opened up something.

97
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Yeah, absolutely.

98
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 So, I'm really sorry, Andres.

99
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Thank you very much for telling us.

100
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 Yeah.

101
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 So, yeah.

102
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 No, absolutely.

103
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Big sauna culture, isn't it?

104
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 It is.

105
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Yeah, but he's from Estonia.

106
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 And I know Estonia and it has a synchia basically

107
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 a 200 yards away from each other,

108
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 but they're still there.

109
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Estonia threw away, aren't they?

110
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 Brilliant.

111
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Wow.

112
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 applause.

113
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 Let's stop the show.

114
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 See you next time.

115
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Why?

116
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 There is short boat ride away from each other.

117
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 It's nice.

118
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 Yeah.

119
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 Okay. Brilliant.

120
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Cool.

121
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 That's true.

122
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Anyway, thank you, Andres.

123
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 Sorry to everyone in that region.

124
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 Let's keep going.

125
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 Hannah Bevan writes.

126
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 If you are actually choking,

127
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 it is an emergency.

128
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Don't faff around calling 111.

129
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 This is a lighthearted comment I made

130
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 off the back of my suggestion

131
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 to yell into someone's mouth.

132
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 That's right.

133
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Come out bone.

134
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 If you are a bone.

135
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 Yeah.

136
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 But good news from Hannah.

137
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 A fish bone in your esophagus is not choking.

138
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Choking is an obstruction of the airway

139
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 and is an immediate threat to life.

140
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 Okay.

141
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 So you can't get oxygen.

142
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 So that's when you do the abdominal

143
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 or the heimlich and all of that.

144
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 If you can talk on the phone you want choking,

145
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 but if you have a stuckfish fish bone,

146
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 yes, see a doctor.

147
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 Okay.

148
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 I think don't come to us for medical advice.

149
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 Yeah.

150
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 Yeah.

151
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Look just generally speaking.

152
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 I think that I would say the only piece

153
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 of medical advice that we've ever given

154
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 that is really solid.

155
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 If you have hiccups,

156
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 put your finger up your bum.

157
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 That's really the only one I stand by.

158
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 That's why I was a terrible GP.

159
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 You really got through those disposable gloves, don't you?

160
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 Drew Eustent.

161
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Drew Eustent.

162
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Disposable.

163
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 Brilliant.

164
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 We've had word of,

165
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 I would say the fish messiah being born.

166
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 Right.

167
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 This is so exciting.

168
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Okay.

169
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 What's that mean?

170
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 Well, James, you know how you're good

171
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 at dishing out harkinings and checking facts.

172
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 And you know, you're, I'd say,

173
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 the sort of most pure facty.

174
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 I hesitate to say so after I messed it up last time.

175
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 But yeah.

176
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 I do like to beautifully pick up people.

177
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 Well, there is another.

178
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 A child has been born.

179
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Who I think might be the next generation.

180
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 Fish the next generation.

181
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 Okay.

182
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 It's my daughter.

183
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 It's not.

184
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 Literally as we were walking home the other day,

185
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 she was like, Danny, did you know that the moon is not a planet?

186
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 I was like, yeah, I did know that.

187
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 Did you know that the sun is not a planet?

188
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 Like, she's just got this, did you know?

189
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 I think going.

190
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 That's great.

191
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 I didn't think so.

192
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 It seems likely.

193
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 She's going to have a rough time growing up saying,

194
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 did you know to you?

195
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 Because you'll say every time, yes.

196
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 You won't, you won't, you won buckle.

197
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 Yeah, you won't.

198
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Actually, when she said, did you know that the moon is not a planet?

199
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 I should have said, oh, really?

200
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 I was supposed to like, yeah.

201
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Obviously I did.

202
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 That's a moon.

203
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 Don't ever bring these matters to me again.

204
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 Well, Aislin Fellow's rights.

205
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 I thought you may enjoy the attached PowerPoint presentation created

206
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 by my eight-year-old daughter, Cersha, for her teacher.

207
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 On the first day of their new topic, Vikings,

208
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 the teacher relayed the usual chat of Viking helmets having horns.

209
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 Oh, wow.

210
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 My daughter attempted to correct her.

211
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 The whole class and the teacher basically told her she was wrong.

212
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 She refused to let this stand.

213
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 And she put together an entire PowerPoint explaining that, no,

214
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 the teacher was wrong about this.

215
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 She sent it over.

216
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 It's a great PowerPoint.

217
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 I'll share a slide on the screen if Aislin doesn't mind.

218
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 We did ask her to remove the original last line of,

219
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 and this is why you're wrong.

220
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 So, she's been forced to wear helmets

221
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 with horns for a school assembly,

222
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 but she plans to display the helmet in her room with a plaque

223
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 describing that it's inaccurate.

224
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 So, you know, this is...

225
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 I know.

226
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 I mean, was that...

227
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Would you have done something like that, do you think?

228
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 I don't think so.

229
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Right.

230
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 Obviously, yes.

231
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 Anyway, congratulations, Aislin.

232
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 Lovely.

233
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 Very great stuff.

234
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 Yeah.

235
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 Wonderful.

236
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Here's a little fact about us.

237
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 We've had a bit of audience research done,

238
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 which I really like.

239
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 Scott McKellen from St. Louis, Missouri,

240
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 has studied a sample of a hundred of our episodes.

241
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 Well, it's quite a big sample.

242
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 Yeah.

243
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 Notice of things that first shares an average of one sex fact

244
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 in 31% of episodes.

245
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 Brackets list-attached.

246
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 That's fewer than I would have thought.

247
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 I agree.

248
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 He's not counting penis mentions.

249
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 Presumably.

250
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 Arguably.

251
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 Arguably, that should be mentioned.

252
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 Yeah.

253
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 I presume that would just make it a hundred percent.

254
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 And it becomes an uninteresting study.

255
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 What period in our life are we talking about here?

256
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 The last 100.

257
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 The last 100 most recent.

258
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 My criteria was this is talking about a sexual position

259
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 or a breathing behavior.

260
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 But if I included every time a reproductive system was mentioned,

261
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 it would have topped 50%.

262
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 And there's a list of all the species we've talked about here.

263
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 A lot of them are water-based.

264
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 Orca, starfish.

265
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 Crocodiles.

266
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 And a fish.

267
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 Orpus.

268
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 Barnacles.

269
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 Good point.

270
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 Humans have come up a few times.

271
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 So to speak.

272
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 Wow.

273
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 The rough periwinkle snail.

274
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 Yeah.

275
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 If only we could tell it.

276
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 It had arrived in a list like this.

277
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 It only had the intelligence to understand.

278
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 Made it.

279
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 Made it, mum.

280
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 You're on a list with the Northern Giant mouse lemur.

281
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 Yeah.

282
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 Yeah.

283
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 Is there a conclusion about our interest?

284
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Or is it just purely data?

285
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 It's purely data.

286
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Yeah.

287
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 I always think if I go on mastermind and had a specialist subject,

288
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 animal sex would be right up there.

289
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 That's a good.

290
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 That's a good idea.

291
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 I feel like there's not much about animal sex

292
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 that I haven't come across over the years.

293
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 Other words better when you're on mastermind.

294
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 I've started self-finished.

295
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 And there we go.

296
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 That's why we'll keep this email in.

297
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 Brilliant.

298
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 Right.

299
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 We come to our radio climb of the week.

300
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 Okay.

301
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 But it's a really positive one actually this time.

302
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 We've had a lot of emails about climbing from climbers.

303
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 Oh, Alex Honald was our fact.

304
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 Let me guess because I've had quite a lot of people arguing

305
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 that he doesn't wear sticky shoes.

306
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 He wears climbing shoes.

307
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 Which I have to say I did know I was doing a bet.

308
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 Right.

309
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 I was saying that he wears sticky shoes.

310
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 I actually didn't know that climbers wore sticky shoes

311
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 until I researched it.

312
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 How sticky?

313
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 It's really interesting.

314
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 It's just like it's a kind of rubber,

315
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 which is particularly good at adhering surfaces.

316
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 It's not, it's got a very high coefficient of friction.

317
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 That's really interesting.

318
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 It doesn't leave a trail behind him.

319
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 It's not like a snail.

320
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 That's why I got alcapitan.

321
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 Okay.

322
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 Yeah, I got quite a lot of that on my own social medias.

323
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 We do.

324
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 We haven't had much of that.

325
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 You'll be relieved to hear it.

326
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 Because one or two did.

327
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 But Mike Robinson says there's a frozen waterfall in London

328
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 that you can ice climb.

329
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 Oh, wow.

330
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 What?

331
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 It's like I've been coven garden.

332
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 What?

333
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 Yeah.

334
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 Not that mountain sharp that's near our old office.

335
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 I think it's the north face.

336
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 Because I've been upstairs and downstairs there.

337
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 And I don't.

338
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 I didn't see it.

339
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 No, there's a climbing place.

340
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 And they've got a frozen waterfall.

341
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 In coven garden.

342
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 I looked it up.

343
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 That's what it's seeing like.

344
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 Wow.

345
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 I know.

346
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 But there's no mention of where it is in this email.

347
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 He included a link, which I clicked.

348
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 Yeah.

349
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 How deep into the weasel we want to get on this one.

350
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 I think we're asking a basic question.

351
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 Where in coven garden is it?

352
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 Do you want me to Google it now?

353
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 We could do it after we could do it after.

354
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 We've got all day.

355
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 Yeah.

356
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 It's your own time.

357
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 You're wasted.

358
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 Or right in if you know where it is.

359
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 It's podcast at qi.com.

360
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 You can't hang that over my head.

361
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 You can't recognize this.

362
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 We can't weaponize this at all.

363
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 Okay.

364
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 Right.

365
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 Andrew says.

366
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 Just Andrew.

367
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 Do you want to guess what the screaming bar fees are when you're doing ice climbing?

368
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 He's an avid rock ice climber in western Canada.

369
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 We're such an international show.

370
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 Very cool.

371
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 Screaming the screaming bar fees.

372
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 It must be something to do with on it.

373
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 Oh, yeah.

374
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 Like bar.

375
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 Yeah.

376
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 It's something that makes you throw up when you're doing an ice climb.

377
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 Is it something to do with your ears not working?

378
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 So you get off balance.

379
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 So I was thinking like a wind, a type of wind that comes in through a crack.

380
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 I can't relay it around your head.

381
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 Quite.

382
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 I'll tell you what it is.

383
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 During a long cold climb, if you grip your ice axes too tight, your hands can go a little numb.

384
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 But if you lower your hands and relax, the blood quickly rushes in too fast.

385
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 And the pain in your hands is such that people will start either screaming or on occasion throwing up.

386
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 All this while partway up a frozen waterfall.

387
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 In Copenhagen.

388
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 It was in Canada.

389
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 But yeah, I mean, it's stunning.

390
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 Like, amazing what people do for fun, isn't it?

391
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 I just don't think it's a massively good idea.

392
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 I think if I was in TLC, I'd be singing "Don't Go Climbing Waterfalls".

393
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 That's really good.

394
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 Frozen or not?

395
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 Yeah.

396
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Lovely.

397
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 Lovely.

398
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 We might need to stand up and sing National Anthem now, because we're going to House of Lords Corner.

399
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 Okay.

400
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 Lord Borwick of Hawkeshead writes, "Speakers' Corner".

401
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 You could call it.

402
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 Very good.

403
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 Yeah.

404
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 We've heard from a Lord.

405
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 Yeah.

406
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 This is huge.

407
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 Okay.

408
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 There's a lot of the rats.

409
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 There's a ton of them these days, aren't there?

410
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 Yeah, there's several hundred.

411
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 Yeah.

412
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 Does the Lord...

413
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 Does the Lord listen to drop us a line?

414
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 He listens to fish.

415
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 Right.

416
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 You don't get this on parenting, are you?

417
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 No.

418
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 Well, do you know?

419
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 I don't.

420
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 And I bet it's really good.

421
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 It is.

422
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 You got a top podcast.

423
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 They are.

424
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 The top podcast.

425
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 Yeah.

426
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 That's great.

427
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 Look, Lord Borwick of Hawkeshead writes, "Yes.

428
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 In episode four of Little Fish, you mentioned Daniel McClies, the Irish painter, and his connection

429
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 with William Sykes and Charles Dickens, and they...

430
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 Sykes was a wrongman whose wife had an affair with Daniel McClies.

431
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 Yes, it was your up-to-date hot gossip, wasn't it?

432
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 And then he uses Sykes in Oliver Twist for Bill Sykes, and there was problems.

433
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 There's an alternate story as to why the two fell out, which I have heard.

434
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 So Lord Borwick is also providing hot gossip.

435
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 Yeah.

436
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 Which is that.

437
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 Sykes, the Lord, was responsible for deciding the pay of painters in the rebuilt houses of Parliament.

438
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 He couldn't agree the price with the painter, McClies, who painted the enormous 50 by 20 foot frescoes

439
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 in the royal gallery of the House of Lords.

440
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 So, Daniel, the painter, painted lady Sykes into both paintings.

441
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 Oh.

442
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 So the wife of the guy who's paying him.

443
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 Yeah, the wife of the wrongman here.

444
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 Yeah.

445
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 She appears in the Trafalgar painting next to a shot Admiral Nelson, and she appears in the Battle of Waterloo,

446
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 standing there with a glass of wine in both.

447
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 Wow.

448
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 Really?

449
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 So that's a good sort of sick burn on someone you could do.

450
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 Is it?

451
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Put your wife in something?

452
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 Yeah.

453
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 I'm not sure why it's a sick burn.

454
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 It's quite cool to immortalize your wife.

455
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 Ah, anyway, so thank you, my Lord.

456
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Oh, yeah.

457
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 I don't know if that's the correct term of, um, probably is.

458
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 Hmm.

459
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 Thank you, Lord B of Hawkshead.

460
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 Never been to Hawkshead?

461
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 Anyone know where it is?

462
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 No.

463
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 Me neither.

464
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 Ian Halliday writes, "Did you know that you can drive from Moscow to California in just one hour?"

465
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 [laughs]

466
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 Which Moscow?

467
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 With the one in Erscher.

468
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 [laughs]

469
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 And California near Falkirk, both in Scotland.

470
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 I haven't heard of either of those.

471
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 Well, school or California?

472
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 Yeah.

473
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 So I'm not sure why this is interesting.

474
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 [laughs]

475
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 You've heard the place in Scotland, though.

476
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

477
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 Yeah, yeah.

478
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 Brilliant.

479
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 Um, Cath Kastner says, "I'm an artist and long time listener of the show.

480
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 And I just had to write him because I was so surprised to hear you mention the sci-fi initiative of the French army."

481
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 Oh, yes.

482
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 I mentioned that.

483
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

484
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 Yeah, they basically had, as far as I can remember, a unit of sci-fi authors who were brought in to predict future warfare, predict, come up with ideas.

485
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 And that was just to them, personally.

486
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 Yeah.

487
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 Good idea.

488
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 But yeah, I don't remember much about it more than that.

489
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 Lots of much sci-ops as sci-fi-ops.

490
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 Mmm, lovely.

491
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 Well, Cath just answers the question that we raised in the episode, but I don't think we answered.

492
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 It's still very much a thing.

493
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 How is it?

494
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 That's cool.

495
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 I've changed their name from red team to radar, but Cath has been working for them, illustrating a book.

496
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 No.

497
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 Yeah, I couldn't write in straightaway as I signed an NDA for bidding me to talk about the project before the book came out.

498
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 But she's free now to talk about it and tell us that it's still going.

499
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 Interesting that they name themselves after quite an old bit of technology.

500
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 Good point.

501
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 You think they'd name themselves after something that's coming in 30 years?

502
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 Yes.

503
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 Yeah, you're right.

504
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 Or do they know something?

505
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 Oh, yeah.

506
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 And we're going to be reduced back to old technology.

507
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 Oh, no.

508
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 That's like that Einstein quotes.

509
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 You know, we said, "I don't know what World War III will be fought with, but I know World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones."

510
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 Yeah.

511
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 It makes me think.

512
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 She didn't tell us what the book is though.

513
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 She's not allowed to tell us that.

514
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 I think the book is out, so she probably is allowed, but she just didn't.

515
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 Okay.

516
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 So we don't know what the book is.

517
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 You didn't Google it?

518
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 I didn't Google it.

519
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 Can you Google it now?

520
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 Yeah, of course.

521
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 Unless you know at home.

522
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 In which case, email podcast at qi.com.

523
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 I do like receiving all the emails, so it's actually not a threat, guys.

524
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 He said, "I like having my head put down the toilet, actually."

525
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 So jokes on you, guys.

526
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 Let's go on to Mike Giggler of the week.

527
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 Yeah.

528
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 Gerard Pethabridge.

529
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 An unbelievably good name.

530
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 Let's have a moment for Gerard Pethabridge.

531
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 Pethabridge is wonderful.

532
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 Gerard Pethabridge.

533
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 It's like it should be Lord Gerard of Pethabridge.

534
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 It does, doesn't it?

535
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 Anyway, congratulations, Gerard.

536
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 You're going to the Lords.

537
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 And Gerard writes, "In the most recent episode where the group called Lily Allen,

538
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 the modern-day Lord Byron."

539
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 Oh, yeah.

540
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 "In the section where you were rattling off similarities."

541
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 Famous father and all that.

542
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 Someone asked, "Does she have a club foot?"

543
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 I think it was you, wasn't it?

544
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 Yeah, and the answer is, "No, Cassavian had a club putt."

545
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 Brilliant.

546
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 Well, Gerard is here to tell you she does.

547
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 In 2024, Lily started selling feet picks on only fans.

548
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 And much like clubfishes for fish fans,

549
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 Lily's feet fans must surely be her club foot.

550
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 Yes.

551
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 Lovely.

552
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 Very good.

553
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 I didn't know that about her.

554
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 Brilliant.

555
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 I've got an extra diesel, by the way, about Lily Allen,

556
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 which is relevant to the show.

557
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 Yeah.

558
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 So, do you remember how much have you spent on Lily Allen foot picks?

559
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 Signed.

560
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 Please.

561
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 So, this is why you read the premier in.

562
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 I don't mind you throwing my clothes on the lawn,

563
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 but please, just a misspeck.

564
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 So, the album was co-written.

565
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 This is a friend of the podcast.

566
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 This is a new album that's just come out.

567
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 Right.

568
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 The album is co-written and co-produced by a producer called Blue May.

569
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 Okay.

570
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 Blue May is a friend of mine.

571
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 He lived here in London.

572
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 He loved fish.

573
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 Okay.

574
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 Do you remember I told a story once.

575
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 I think James, you might have been off,

576
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 but I told a story once about a sausage dog that has such large dangling testicles.

577
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 That when it walked down the stairs, they banged down the stairs.

578
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 That dog belonged to Blue May, the producer of Lily Allen's album.

579
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 Does she mention it in any of the songs?

580
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 I think they're quite self-biographical.

581
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 They are.

582
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 I don't think Dave, the sausage dog, was around anymore by the time Lily came onto the scene.

583
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Wow.

584
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 Yeah.

585
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 So, the producer of Lily Allen's album is a friend of the podcast by his dog.

586
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 Wow.

587
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 Well, that's...

588
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 Sometimes you don't realise you're famous, like mega-famous.

589
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 And then you just hear something and you realise, wow, we've come a long way.

590
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 We know a book.

591
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 He's got a sausage dog with big balls.

592
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 It's called Dave.

593
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 But he also produced Lily Allen's new albums.

594
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 Yeah.

595
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 Did he use any of the dog-stairball noises in the album?

596
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 Yeah.

597
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 What do you think is a high heart?

598
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 Is actually...

599
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 Well, thank you for that.

600
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 That's really cool.

601
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 Yeah.

602
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 Yeah.

603
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 Max Dweck says, "I have one request if at all possible."

604
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 This is about...

605
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 Max has become a friend of the podcast on Patreon, where you get to sponsor a fact.

606
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 I'm quite touched by this, so I just thought I mentioned it.

607
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 I know I must be very far down on the custodian fact list.

608
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 I really am sorry.

609
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 We've had a rush.

610
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 We're going to get you all your facts as soon as we can.

611
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 Yeah.

612
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 That's totally great.

613
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 But it would truly be an honour when it is my turn.

614
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 Could you please assign me not a headline fact.

615
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 But one of Andy's most boring side facts.

616
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 Like me.

617
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 And make it more specific, please.

618
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 Like maybe model railways using coal for coal.

619
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 I love Andy's boring side facts.

620
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 Nice.

621
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 So, thank you, Max.

622
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 I just...

623
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 I'm really touched by that.

624
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 Yeah.

625
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 So some people like them.

626
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 It's all I'm trying to say.

627
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 Yeah.

628
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 One person.

629
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 Thank you, Max.

630
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 Oh, we like them as well.

631
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 We love them.

632
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 Thank you.

633
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 That's why you're here.

634
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 And luckily, there will be plenty of headline facts that fill that criteria from Andy.

635
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 So...

636
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 It's not just the side facts.

637
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 It's not the side facts.

638
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 Sorry, Max.

639
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 Okay.

640
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 Okay.

641
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 Okay.

642
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 Luke McNeil writes.

643
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 Uh-huh.

644
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 In a recent Listen to Call in Episode.

645
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 Oh, so this was a drop as a line.

646
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 It might have been last drop as a line, but one.

647
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 Okay.

648
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,400
 Andy mentioned his idea for a movie about a Ragtag group of world record holders defeating

649
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,400
 criminals or terrorists.

650
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,400
 And the final climactic moments depend on the Guinness record keepers stopwatch ability.

651
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,400
 Yes.

652
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,400
 Right?

653
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,400
 Cast your minds back.

654
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,400
 We've had some titles in.

655
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,400
 Oh, great.

656
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,400
 Because don't know.

657
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,400
 Was the first suggestion.

658
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,400
 Yeah.

659
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,400
 Hall of oddities or holers, something like that was another one.

660
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,400
 Something.

661
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,400
 I don't really remember this very well.

662
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,400
 Well, it was about the Guinness.

663
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,400
 I was about...

664
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,400
 You've explained what it is, but.

665
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,400
 Andy's dream led to a plot that we hashed out on the show.

666
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,400
 I woke up with an idea for a major franchise.

667
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,400
 Yeah.

668
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,400
 Well, Luke McNeil has the title.

669
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,400
 It's second hand heroes.

670
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,400
 This works on so many levels.

671
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,400
 For one, the heroes in question are not exactly who you would think of as heroes.

672
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,400
 Also, second hand obviously refers to the second hand of the stopwatch.

673
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,400
 Oh.

674
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,400
 Okay, I think it's just those two levels.

675
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,400
 It's a good title though.

676
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,400
 Nice.

677
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,400
 Whereas Troy Holland.

678
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,400
 A very amazing two place name.

679
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,400
 A person name.

680
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,400
 Only one of the mechston.

681
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,400
 Yeah, true.

682
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,400
 Troy Holland says, "I think the movie should be called Try Hard."

683
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,400
 Which is not to die hard.

684
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,400
 Because it's the plot of die hard, which we're being upfront about.

685
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,400
 Right.

686
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,400
 I like it.

687
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,400
 And also, most Guinness world record holders surely try hard in their record attempts.

688
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,400
 Oh, yeah.

689
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,400
 I did get that from the first three minutes.

690
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,400
 Sorry, I didn't.

691
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,400
 Until I got to that sentence in the email.

692
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,400
 If he ever writes a memoir, "Troy Hard" will be a great title.

693
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,400
 Oh my god.

694
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,400
 Yeah.

695
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,400
 I love it.

696
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,400
 I'm a university challenge when people get an answer right.

697
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,400
 Do you know they often pick up a glass of water and just congratulate themselves.

698
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,400
 I love how you just did that down after that joke.

699
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,400
 I have to be careful because I'm running out of water.

700
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:10,400
 These puns are not going to stop any time soon.

701
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,400
 It's because you know the applause break.

702
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,400
 It's coming.

703
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,400
 Yeah, that's it, isn't it?

704
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,400
 Yeah.

705
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,400
 All right.

706
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,400
 Let's have something about space now.

707
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,400
 Okay.

708
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,400
 The final frontier.

709
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,400
 This is the log of Andrew Hunter Murray.

710
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,400
 What we're doing, astronaut's logs actually.

711
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,400
 Oh, no.

712
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,400
 Because Aiden Kotter writes in with facts about astronauts going to the moon space.

713
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,400
 Which we did on Little Fish, didn't we?

714
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,400
 Yeah, we know.

715
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,400
 Yes.

716
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,400
 That's all right.

717
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,400
 We were sent in a fact about the ISS having you're able to tell how much urine is in the urine tank.

718
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,400
 The P-tank blue sky account.

719
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,400
 That's right.

720
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,400
 38 percent.

721
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,400
 38.

722
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,400
 Yes.

723
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:54,600
 Well, Aiden's just following up with a little bit of information because there are some amazing

724
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,400
 stuff about these missions.

725
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,400
 So obviously it's, we is much easier to do with them poo.

726
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,400
 Oh, yeah.

727
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:08,400
 But where you can just put on some sauna calls.

728
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,400
 Well, okay.

729
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:16,400
 During the Apollo and Gemini missions, the NASA teams gave the first men on the moon bags

730
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,400
 to go into.

731
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,400
 Yeah.

732
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,400
 They did know that.

733
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:24,400
 But what I didn't know is that in zero gravity there is a problem with achieving separation.

734
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,400
 Oh.

735
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,400
 You see what I mean?

736
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,400
 So the poo, you might, you might be pooing.

737
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:38,400
 Oh, so it's like you know those plasticine things where you feed the plasticine in and it comes out in a shape.

738
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,400
 Yeah.

739
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,400
 And then you cut the plasticine off.

740
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,400
 So you get your sausage.

741
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,400
 You have to.

742
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,400
 You have to.

743
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,400
 So the NASA designed bags with special finger compartments to allow.

744
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,400
 Wow.

745
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,400
 A astronauts in question two.

746
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,400
 Does your Sphinx and I'll do that.

747
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,400
 No.

748
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,400
 I thought, yeah, can you not do a bum squeeze to finish it?

749
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,400
 God.

750
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,400
 I'm sorry.

751
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,400
 I brought this up.

752
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,400
 But it's, I think it doesn't flee.

753
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,400
 It doesn't flee from you the way it normally does on Earth.

754
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,400
 Oh, I see.

755
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,400
 So it wasn't, it was cut.

756
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,400
 But it wouldn't.

757
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,400
 I'm afraid so.

758
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,400
 You know, you know, it's not enough.

759
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,400
 It's not enough push that when you get it out.

760
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,400
 Sorry if you're eating.

761
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:18,400
 It does feel like you would even because there's no friction in space.

762
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,400
 One squeeze.

763
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,400
 Yeah.

764
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,400
 It would go away and then it would just continue on its way into deep space.

765
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,400
 In space.

766
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,400
 No one can hear you squeeze.

767
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,400
 Yeah.

768
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,400
 Or if it just hangs it, could you fart and the air propellate?

769
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,400
 I wonder if it's strong enough to propel it.

770
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,400
 A single fart because there is talk about astronauts farting to propel themselves.

771
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,400
 That is not strong enough.

772
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:43,400
 There is talk on the website that goes to.

773
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:51,400
 What briefing paper stated this got to in NASA?

774
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,400
 Is talk.

775
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,400
 I love that.

776
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,400
 Anyway.

777
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,400
 So thank you, Aidan, for that disgusting fact.

778
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,400
 That's great.

779
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,400
 Yeah.

780
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,400
 That's great.

781
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,400
 So, okay.

782
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,400
 Two fingers as part of a plastic bag that you can thumb presumably.

783
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,400
 I don't know if it's all fingers.

784
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,400
 I haven't.

785
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,400
 You might as well do.

786
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,400
 There's no point having like mittens.

787
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,400
 You might as well have all their fingers available.

788
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,400
 Yeah.

789
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,400
 Shittons, you could call them.

790
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,400
 Yes.

791
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,400
 Tag me your water.

792
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,400
 Let's have some of the non-determ.

793
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,400
 Oh.

794
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,400
 Let's go to non-determ, Ali.

795
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:32,400
 Kevin McGillivre says there is a 15 year old chess grandmaster from Iran whose name is

796
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,400
 Sinah.

797
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,400
 Move ahead.

798
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,400
 Sinah.

799
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,400
 Move ahead.

800
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,400
 He's a move ahead.

801
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,400
 Sinah move ahead.

802
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,400
 That's very good.

803
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,400
 That's stunning.

804
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,400
 Yeah.

805
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,400
 That's good.

806
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,400
 Never heard of him.

807
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,400
 That's really.

808
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,400
 That's quite creepy non-determinism.

809
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,400
 Yeah.

810
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,400
 That's.

811
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,400
 Hang on.

812
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:54,400
 Harry not writes in about Adele Acta.

813
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,400
 Just wondering at what age Adele Acta realized he'd be an ideal actor.

814
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,400
 He's an actor.

815
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,400
 Yeah.

816
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,400
 Incredible.

817
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,400
 He's an actor.

818
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,400
 Yep.

819
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,400
 Great.

820
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:09,400
 Ross Harvey says, the press secretary for the Reagan administration was named Larry Speaks.

821
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:14,400
 Press secretary, which makes him both a sentence person and an example of nominative determinism.

822
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,400
 Oh, that's good.

823
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,400
 Yeah.

824
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,400
 Is that brilliant?

825
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,400
 Yeah.

826
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,400
 We have to go back briefly to the nulla ball plane.

827
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,400
 Oh, no.

828
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:28,280
 In a section we're now calling nulla balls.

829
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:33,280
 Can I say I think there's a chance one day we might go back to Australia for a tour.

830
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,280
 Yeah.

831
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,280
 If you guys want us to come, we'll come.

832
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,280
 Yeah.

833
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:44,280
 And I would love to do a gig, a gig in the nulla ball plane.

834
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:48,280
 In the 500 miles of nothing in every direction.

835
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,280
 I would be good.

836
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,280
 That would be great.

837
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,280
 I'm up for it.

838
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,280
 That would be awesome.

839
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,280
 Yeah.

840
00:27:53,280 --> 00:28:00,280
 Well, Mike Cowley is a former West Australian civil engineer and isn't writing about how you

841
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,280
 say the word nulla ball.

842
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:08,280
 He does include that as part of his email, but there's a thing amazing thing about road trains.

843
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,280
 Right.

844
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,280
 Which is this.

845
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,280
 You know, you get a huge.

846
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,280
 You've got a big semi on the front.

847
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,280
 And you've got a lot of characters on the back.

848
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,280
 Yeah.

849
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,280
 Trailers and all that.

850
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:23,280
 But this is a fantastic tiny extra bonus fact that I think probably only a former West Australian

851
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,280
 civil engineer would know.

852
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,280
 Okay.

853
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,280
 So he's from Perth.

854
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,280
 Like almost everyone in West Australia.

855
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:36,280
 Geometric rose design is typically completed using the Ostrodes guide to road design part

856
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,280
 three.

857
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,280
 Okay.

858
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,280
 You've already got Andy.

859
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,280
 He's hooked.

860
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,280
 You had me.

861
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:50,280
 No design.

862
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:59,280
 I'm flying a fighter jet right now.

863
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,280
 I'm part of this process.

864
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,280
 It's the calculation.

865
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:08,280
 I promise this is good of the site stopping distances, which take into account vehicle speed road surface

866
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,280
 road grade and reaction time.

867
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,280
 Yeah, sure.

868
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,280
 You had to learn that for your highway code in back in the day.

869
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:22,280
 And the reaction time is selected by the engineer based on road conditions slash drivers circumstances.

870
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,280
 So the engineer is building the road.

871
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:28,280
 Maybe a Len B Del or similar.

872
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:33,280
 You use either a reaction time of 1.5 seconds, two seconds or two and a half.

873
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:39,280
 And there's this tiny note in Ostrodes guide to road design part three, which says reaction

874
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:45,280
 time of 1.5 seconds, that's the fastest, cannot be used in Western Australia.

875
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:50,280
 A 1.5 second reaction time is owned to be used in constrained situations where drivers will be alert.

876
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:54,280
 The general minimum reaction time is two seconds.

877
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:58,280
 And Mike writes, there is no reason Western Australia should be treated differently.

878
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,280
 It's not regional Western Australia.

879
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,280
 It's all of it.

880
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:05,280
 The only conclusion I can fathom is we take just a fraction of a moment longer to do things over here.

881
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,280
 It's just a slower pace of life.

882
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:12,280
 Not because there is lots of featureless land.

883
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:18,280
 And so you kind of kind of dose off a little bit and your reaction times are worse.

884
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,280
 That's a very good theory.

885
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,280
 It doesn't explain why.

886
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,280
 It's maybe ungoogleable.

887
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:28,280
 Thank you so much, Mike Cowley for that barnstormer of an email.

888
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:31,280
 Great little spot of a tiny, tiny detail.

889
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,280
 I think that's why I liked it so much.

890
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:38,280
 I'm a former Western Australian road engineer.

891
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,280
 That gets me going.

892
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,280
 That pumps me up.

893
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,280
 Should we have last one?

894
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,280
 Last one.

895
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,280
 Let's do it.

896
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:47,280
 Dan, you like saying things about yourself on the show.

897
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,280
 Okay.

898
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,280
 You reveal things about yourself, don't you?

899
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,280
 Yeah.

900
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,280
 If I think of something that's relevant to the chat, I'll pop it in.

901
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,280
 Yeah.

902
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,280
 But you don't keep yourself secret.

903
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,280
 No.

904
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,280
 You know, I do.

905
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,280
 I'm very private.

906
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,280
 And you're much more open, I'd say.

907
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,280
 Okay.

908
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,280
 And James, you're somewhere in the middle.

909
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,280
 Yeah.

910
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:08,280
 I think, especially in the little fish, we're all revealing ourselves a little bit more.

911
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,280
 That's true.

912
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,280
 than we ever have before.

913
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,280
 But what I do wonder is where the fuck you're going with this?

914
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:20,280
 I can't think of where.

915
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:27,280
 I can't think of where.

916
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,280
 I can't think of where.

917
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:32,280
 I'm not even playing at being innocent, I genuinely.

918
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,280
 I don't know what you're trying to get.

919
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,280
 We're such an unusual start to a bit.

920
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,280
 I guess you're right.

921
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,280
 It was weird.

922
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,280
 It was weird of me to say.

923
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:46,280
 Basically, we've had a fact from something we said on little fish about celebrities who give out

924
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,280
 their personal phone number.

925
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,280
 Oh, yeah.

926
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,280
 Yeah.

927
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,280
 Patsy Clien.

928
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,280
 Patsy Clien.

929
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,280
 Yeah.

930
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,280
 At Laurel Hardy.

931
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,280
 Yes.

932
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,280
 Stan Laurel.

933
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,280
 Yes.

934
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,280
 That's right.

935
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:02,280
 And then about the former T-Shock of Ireland, Ender Kenny.

936
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,280
 Oh, yeah.

937
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,280
 Not that long ago though.

938
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,280
 Not that long ago.

939
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,280
 No.

940
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:12,280
 Who was replaced by Leo Veracca and Olivia just right.

941
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:17,280
 She remembers a conversation with her politics teacher where she was told Ender Kenny was so prone to giving out

942
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:22,280
 his personal phone number to anyone who asked that two thirds of Kerry had him in their contacts.

943
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,280
 And I just really like this.

944
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,280
 So she tried to back it up.

945
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,280
 She tried to do a bit more research.

946
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,280
 Yeah.

947
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,280
 She tried to Google it.

948
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,280
 But it turns out that he has done this loads.

949
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,280
 That's really great.

950
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,280
 Ender Kenny.

951
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:39,280
 And there's a news article she included the link to where Ender Kenny says his open invitation to global

952
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,280
 business to call him anytime has had some unexpected consequences.

953
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,280
 And he basically told the load of people.

954
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,280
 Call me anytime.

955
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,280
 And more or less put his number up on the screen.

956
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:52,280
 And he then said, Christ, I'm getting phone calls from Adelaide and New Zealand and everywhere.

957
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,280
 They're not all about industry.

958
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,280
 That's really cool.

959
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,280
 Oh, that's really cool.

960
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,280
 Anyway, this is a nice little effect.

961
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,280
 Yeah.

962
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,280
 But Ender Kenny.

963
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,280
 Who I think could be a friend of the podcast you never know with that kind of attitude.

964
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,280
 Friend of Kenny.

965
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,280
 Yeah.

966
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,280
 Friend of Kenny.

967
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:13,280
 Brilliant.

968
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,280
 All right.

969
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,280
 That's your lot.

970
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,280
 Yeah.

971
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,280
 Great.

972
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,280
 Good stuff.

973
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,280
 Always good stuff.

974
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,280
 Yeah.

975
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:29,280
 I would say at the moment, probably the inbox is a little bit gone.

976
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,280
 The inbox is looking very hollow.

977
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,280
 So what do we need?

978
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,280
 We need emails.

979
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,280
 I see what you're doing there.

980
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,280
 You're helping me.

981
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,280
 You have to be kidding out of this.

982
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,280
 You do need a bit of that.

983
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,280
 You've gone out of it.

984
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,280
 We're bringing you back in.

985
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,280
 Just what I think I'm out.

986
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,280
 It will be right back in.

987
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,280
 No, James is right.

988
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,280
 We need emails.

989
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,280
 We need them urgently.

990
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:56,280
 If you are a former Western Australian road engineer and you've noticed something funny

991
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,280
 in "Ost Roads" volume three.

992
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,280
 If you're flying a fighter jet.

993
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,280
 If you're flying a fighter jet, please send it.

994
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,280
 I mean, I'll glance at it.

995
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:10,280
 No, if you have anything to say about anything we've said on any of our 600 episodes,

996
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:14,280
 40 on drop of the lines and a growing number of little fish, we'd love to hear it.

997
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,280
 We'd love getting emails as we've mentioned once or twice before.

998
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,280
 It's podcast@QI.com.

999
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,280
 And we'll do another one of these in a couple of weeks.

1000
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,280
 But until then, it's by from these two.

1001
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,280
 Bye.

1002
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,280
 So long.

1003
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,280
 It's by from me.

1004
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,280
 Oh, I'm afraid it's too wrong.

1005
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,280
 There's no one else to say goodbye.

1006
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,280
 What about Little Andy?

1007
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,280
 What about me?

1008
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,280
 What about me?

1009
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,280
 What about me?

1010
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,280
 It's by quite fun, Governor.

1011
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,280
 He doesn't know how to fucking.

1012
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,280
 What about even smaller Andy?

1013
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,280
 What about me?

1014
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,280
 Why?
