00:00:15,00:00:20,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:20,00:00:23,to you from the QI Officers in Covenant Garden.
00:00:23,00:00:28,"My name is Antigensky, I am here with Andrew Hunter Murray, and this week we are joined"
00:00:28,00:00:36,"by two great pillars of QI, the producer of QI, Piers Fletcher, and one of QI's longest"
00:00:36,00:00:42,"serving been there for a million years, researchers and historian Justin Pollard."
00:00:42,00:00:45,"And once again, we've gathered around the microphones with our four favourite facts in the last"
00:00:45,00:00:50,"seven days, and in no particular audit here we go, starting with you Justin."
00:00:50,00:00:57,"Okay, so the first person recorded ever buying a pornographic book in England was Samuel"
00:00:57,00:00:59,Peep's.
00:00:59,00:01:02,So how was he recorded?
00:01:02,00:01:06,"Typically idiotically, he managed to record it himself, because he knows Peep's wrote"
00:01:06,00:01:11,"this sort of 10-year diary, which is great, he records a great fire of London and the"
00:01:11,00:01:14,"plague and all sorts of big events, but the main use of it is he records the details"
00:01:14,00:01:19,"of his everyday life, and he wrote in his diary that he'd seen the idol Rogish book Les"
00:01:19,00:01:26,"Shoulder Fee which I have bought in plain binding, and he takes it home and he reads it, but"
00:01:26,00:01:29,"then he promises himself in his diary, which is written in short-hand, so nobody else can"
00:01:29,00:01:34,"read it, that as soon as I've read it, I will burn it, which as far as we know he did."
00:01:34,00:01:37,There's only one copy left of this book in the world.
00:01:37,00:01:38,Wow.
00:01:38,00:01:43,So he burned it in order to save himself the embarrassment of having it found among his
00:01:43,00:01:45,"collection, but then he recorded the fact that he'd read it in his diary."
00:01:45,00:01:49,He felt the clearest prose of history.
00:01:49,00:01:51,"When he bought it, he wrote in his diary, well I was thinking about getting it, because"
00:01:51,00:01:56,"in French, it would be a good translation tool for my wife, and then I think he saw what"
00:01:56,00:01:58,was in it and thought maybe not.
00:01:58,00:02:02,"Yeah, but the great thing is that he found it and then he went away for a month nearly."
00:02:02,00:02:07,"It's obviously been praying on his mind, he could have gone, ""I might just go down the"
00:02:07,00:02:08,"strand."""
00:02:08,00:02:11,"And then eventually, ""Oh, look, is that bookshop again?"""
00:02:11,00:02:17,And then he's apparently stayed there and he hang about in the bookshop for an hour before
00:02:17,00:02:18,actually buying it.
00:02:18,00:02:21,In a plane binding.
00:02:21,00:02:22,Exactly.
00:02:22,00:02:26,"So sorry, was the plane binding in the same way as the adults read Harry Potter with a different"
00:02:26,00:02:27,binding?
00:02:27,00:02:28,"Yeah, exactly."
00:02:28,00:02:33,"It was just so that, you know, when he's got only a shelf at home, it doesn't say pornographic"
00:02:33,00:02:34,book.
00:02:34,00:02:39,He says the reason is because he was cheaper in plane binding and he only took it home in order
00:02:39,00:02:40,to destroy it.
00:02:40,00:02:41,No one destroyed it.
00:02:41,00:02:42,This is a diary.
00:02:42,00:02:45,"He tends to know what else to read, but he's lying to himself, and it's the only thing."
00:02:45,00:02:48,"It is work, because at the end of his diaries, because he gave up after about ten"
00:02:48,00:02:51,"years, the personal diary, because of his eyesight was failing."
00:02:51,00:02:53,He was making him blind.
00:02:53,00:02:54,Yeah.
00:02:54,00:02:55,That's right.
00:02:55,00:02:56,Yeah.
00:02:56,00:02:59,"And he said, ""I'm going to keep going with my other diary,"" because he kept another diary"
00:02:59,00:03:01,"going, but it was just official engagements and things like that."
00:03:01,00:03:03,And it was being kept for him by other people.
00:03:03,00:03:08,"So he said, ""I'll have to put in only what I can decently tell other people, and which"
00:03:08,00:03:09,"I will be sure won't get out."""
00:03:09,00:03:11,Did he mean that for it to be seen?
00:03:11,00:03:12,Do we know?
00:03:12,00:03:13,We don't know for his private diary.
00:03:13,00:03:17,"Certainly it is, not during his lifetime, not by his wife, obviously."
00:03:17,00:03:20,"So he does recall sort of every detail in it, and he has numerous affairs."
00:03:20,00:03:24,"But the funny thing is, he obviously must be very conflicted, because he's writing it,"
00:03:24,00:03:26,"as you say, in code."
00:03:26,00:03:30,"But at the same time, he copies it out in fair, and puts it into leatherbounds, I think,"
00:03:30,00:03:31,and makes sure that it's...
00:03:31,00:03:34,So there must be some parvin that was saying somebody's going to read this and enjoy this
00:03:34,00:03:35,one day.
00:03:35,00:03:37,"Otherwise, you know, why would you bother him?"
00:03:37,00:03:39,I think he must have thought.
00:03:39,00:03:41,"I think that's like teenagers do that all the time, don't they?"
00:03:41,00:03:44,Right about their boyfriends and pretend that they want to hide the knowledge of it and
00:03:44,00:03:45,leave it carefully.
00:03:45,00:03:50,"But in a long time, in the future, it will be lovely when people get to read about my life."
00:03:50,00:03:54,I think what he had was an early case of Port noise complaint.
00:03:54,00:03:58,Port noise complaint is a disorder in which strongly felt ethical and altruistic impulses
00:03:58,00:04:01,are perpetually worrying with extreme sexual longings of a perverse nature.
00:04:01,00:04:06,"Yeah, because he does say he's, there's nothing wrong with a decent man, a morally upstanding"
00:04:06,00:04:09,"man reading material like that, for the sake of educating himself."
00:04:09,00:04:10,And he justifies himself.
00:04:10,00:04:14,"As they did right into the 19th century with the secret room of the British Museum,"
00:04:14,00:04:18,which contained all the sort of phallic statuary and things that were considered inappropriate
00:04:18,00:04:19,for the public.
00:04:19,00:04:24,"There was a secret museum at Naples, and it's exactly the same thing."
00:04:24,00:04:29,"All the erotic art that was found at Pompey and Herculaneum, so there's a statue of the"
00:04:29,00:04:33,"god Pan, sort of, he's getting off with a goat."
00:04:33,00:04:38,"Yes, that's extraordinary, he really is, they really are in a loving embrace."
00:04:38,00:04:39,"Definitely, yeah."
00:04:39,00:04:41,And that is the same thing that happened.
00:04:41,00:04:46,"Pompey had these erotic frescoes, and they had locked metal cabinets put over them."
00:04:46,00:04:49,"But if you were a gentleman and you paid a small fee, they would remove the locked metal"
00:04:49,00:04:52,"cabinet from the top of the fresco, and you could see it."
00:04:52,00:04:54,"But if you're a woman, no dice, I'm afraid, Anna."
00:04:54,00:04:58,"The interesting thing is, what you're saying is the first recorded instance of by your"
00:04:58,00:05:01,"own buying pornography, but apparently what happened was, most pornography at that time"
00:05:01,00:05:06,"was circulated in the form of manuscript, miscellaneous, that people would keep, people"
00:05:06,00:05:11,"would keep a miscellany of these kinds of things, but also recipes and political tracks and school"
00:05:11,00:05:15,"exercises, and they'd just keep them all bound together for themselves and to give to their"
00:05:15,00:05:16,friends.
00:05:16,00:05:17,But there was only ever one copy of each one.
00:05:17,00:05:18,I've got one here.
00:05:18,00:05:24,"This is the guy, I mean, Anthony Scattergood, who was a theologian in English."
00:05:24,00:05:30,"In his miscellany, he has an erotic poem called ""On Six Cambridge Mades Bailing Themselves"
00:05:30,00:05:34,"by Queen's College"" during the 15th, 1629, which is quite good."
00:05:34,00:05:39,"And then immediately after that is a recipe that says, ""For the eyes, take snails and prick"
00:05:39,00:05:43,"them through the shells with a great pin, and they will issue out a fat water, drop the"
00:05:43,00:05:45,"same into the eyes evening and morning."""
00:05:45,00:05:46,Wow.
00:05:46,00:05:50,"And you know, so that, frankly, probably less attractive than the six..."
00:05:50,00:05:54,"Anyway, that was the kind of thing they just gathered together in this miscellany."
00:05:54,00:05:57,"And often in verse form as well, because if it was in verse, it was a sort of a little bit"
00:05:57,00:06:02,"less sort of graphic, it was a bit more arty if it was in verse, so best selling pornographic"
00:06:02,00:06:07,"verses of the 15th century is a book called ""The Tale of Two Lovers"" in Ginoe wrote it."
00:06:07,00:06:09,"Oh, that was the Pope's one, wasn't it?"
00:06:09,00:06:10,"He was Pope-Past, the second."
00:06:10,00:06:11,Wow.
00:06:11,00:06:14,"This was to be fair before he became Pope, then he wrote this book."
00:06:14,00:06:16,"All the Popes have a past, don't they?"
00:06:16,00:06:20,"So there was the goalkeeper and there was the Hitler-Euth guy, as you know."
00:06:20,00:06:21,Yeah.
00:06:21,00:06:24,"And the one who wrote ""The Tale of Two Lovers."""
00:06:24,00:06:26,That is saucy of the most Popes.
00:06:26,00:06:27,Samuel Piebs.
00:06:27,00:06:28,Samuel Piebs.
00:06:28,00:06:29,Samuel Piebs.
00:06:29,00:06:33,My favourite line in all the diaries is he woke up and he was going down into the cellar
00:06:33,00:06:38,"and his exact words are ""and put my foot into a great heap of turds by mistake."""
00:06:38,00:06:40,That's just very funny.
00:06:40,00:06:45,One of the only things I knew about Samuel Piebs is that he buried his parmesan during
00:06:45,00:06:46,the Great Fire of London.
00:06:46,00:06:47,"Oh, yes."
00:06:47,00:06:51,"I did not know that he was involved in the Great Fire of London, and then he went to visit..."
00:06:51,00:06:52,He's not at it.
00:06:52,00:06:53,Yeah?
00:06:53,00:06:57,"No, he went to visit the King halfway through and advised the King, ""Will you need"
00:06:57,00:07:01,to pull down the houses where the fire hasn't got to yet and make what they call a fire
00:07:01,00:07:02,"break?"""
00:07:02,00:07:03,So it doesn't spread outside that area.
00:07:03,00:07:07,Didn't he say he also said that the fire of London went on for months and months after
00:07:07,00:07:08,we thought it did?
00:07:08,00:07:10,So I think it was still burning in March the following year.
00:07:10,00:07:11,What?
00:07:11,00:07:12,Yeah.
00:07:12,00:07:13,It's not weird.
00:07:13,00:07:14,"And it started in September, so I think..."
00:07:14,00:07:15,No.
00:07:15,00:07:16,Really?
00:07:16,00:07:17,Really strange.
00:07:17,00:07:20,"Another thing I didn't know about him was that he sort of wore spectacles, which he was"
00:07:20,00:07:23,very impressed by and thought worked really well.
00:07:23,00:07:29,"But what they were was paper tubes, which had been invented a few decades earlier."
00:07:29,00:07:33,And they were just rolled up bits of black paper and they were wider at the eye end than
00:07:33,00:07:39,"they were at the reading end, and so they focused right in on tiny lettering, and it kind of"
00:07:39,00:07:40,worked.
00:07:40,00:07:41,I guess it gets rid of...
00:07:41,00:07:42,You're glad?
00:07:42,00:07:43,"Well, it's a small aperture, isn't it?"
00:07:43,00:07:47,"You know how with a camera, people don't use old fashion cameras, but with a small aperture"
00:07:47,00:07:50,"on the lens, you get a much greater depth of field and you're just using that effect."
00:07:50,00:07:55,"You know, he said that Nero had emeralds polished as glasses, so for his reading, but he was Nero."
00:07:55,00:07:56,Yeah.
00:07:56,00:08:00,And that's probably a made-up story.
00:08:00,00:08:06,"OK, let's move on to fact number two, and that is from Pizz."
00:08:06,00:08:08,"Yeah, this is me."
00:08:08,00:08:15,"My fact is that if 50 people swam continuously for 15 months in an Olympic-sized swimming pool,"
00:08:15,00:08:16,the water would boil.
00:08:16,00:08:17,Ha!
00:08:17,00:08:19,Have you worked that out?
00:08:19,00:08:20,Yeah.
00:08:20,00:08:21,I've got the physics.
00:08:21,00:08:22,The thing is...
00:08:22,00:08:23,It's rubbish.
00:08:23,00:08:27,"The physics, you know, basically doesn't work, but so what we do..."
00:08:27,00:08:31,"It's an idealised model, but what this comes from is the general James Jewel, after whom"
00:08:31,00:08:35,"the Jewel is named, named, and a Jewel is the amount of energy it takes to lift a tomato"
00:08:35,00:08:38,one metre from the ground.
00:08:38,00:08:39,But the thing is...
00:08:39,00:08:40,I'll bigger tomato.
00:08:40,00:08:41,A hundred-gram tomato.
00:08:41,00:08:42,Right.
00:08:42,00:08:43,Standard tomato.
00:08:43,00:08:45,"Oh, you're a standard European tomato."
00:08:45,00:08:46,Yeah.
00:08:46,00:08:49,"Anyway, it's also the point is it's also the amount of energy released when you drop the"
00:08:49,00:08:52,"tomato back to the ground, and that each of those is one Jewel."
00:08:52,00:08:54,And the point about that is conservation of energy.
00:08:54,00:08:57,"You can't create a destroy energy, only converted from one for another."
00:08:57,00:09:01,"So, if you have people swimming around, they raise the temperature of the water, and he"
00:09:01,00:09:05,"demonstrated this, and he had a tank, which was sealed, and he had a paddle in it, and"
00:09:05,00:09:06,"a rope, which..."
00:09:06,00:09:10,"Or a string of something that came out of the top over a pulley, and then he had a weight"
00:09:10,00:09:15,"on the end, and the weight drops, turns the paddle, and he measures the temperature of"
00:09:15,00:09:19,"the water, and is able to demonstrate that the amount of energy from the dropping"
00:09:19,00:09:25,weight is exactly equal to the amount of energy from the increase in temperature in the water.
00:09:25,00:09:26,So...
00:09:26,00:09:29,Does it matter what stroke you'd be doing?
00:09:29,00:09:30,No.
00:09:30,00:09:32,It's just about your body heat.
00:09:32,00:09:33,"Well, that's the other thing."
00:09:33,00:09:34,It's not about your body heat.
00:09:34,00:09:37,"For the purposes of this calculation, I've excluded the body heat effect."
00:09:37,00:09:38,Right.
00:09:38,00:09:42,"If you excluded the fact that if you put people in 50 degree water, they tend to sort of"
00:09:42,00:09:43,stop functioning.
00:09:43,00:09:44,Certainly after 15 months.
00:09:44,00:09:51,I've got various things that need to be left out of the calculation here in often making
00:09:51,00:09:52,work.
00:09:52,00:09:54,"One of them is that the water, in this idealised swimming pool, doesn't radiate heat"
00:09:54,00:09:55,away.
00:09:55,00:09:57,They create all stays there.
00:09:57,00:10:02,"The other is that there's nothing to do with the body heat, and the other thing is that"
00:10:02,00:10:06,"you have to find a swimming pool that's open on Christmas Day, because otherwise..."
00:10:06,00:10:11,"That is the hardest thing, as opposed to the laws of thermodynamics, which are easy to"
00:10:11,00:10:12,move around.
00:10:12,00:10:14,Is it a lido that we're looking for?
00:10:14,00:10:18,"Yeah, and the other thing actually, which makes it difficult, is an Olympic-sized swimming pool."
00:10:18,00:10:20,"You know, this does not have a standard size."
00:10:20,00:10:21,Really?
00:10:21,00:10:23,The depth is not standard.
00:10:23,00:10:26,It can be anything from two metres to three metres.
00:10:26,00:10:29,"The pool in my illustration, I'm not going to actually run till these numbers, so I'm"
00:10:29,00:10:31,"looking at this, but it's two metres deep."
00:10:31,00:10:37,"It starts at 20 degrees, it would take 11,200 hours, which is 466 days, to raise the temperature"
00:10:37,00:10:39,by 80 degrees from that.
00:10:39,00:10:44,"And the other thing, of course, you've got to contend with, is what point people die."
00:10:44,00:10:47,"You can replace them, though, so you could just have substitutes to simply just stand in."
00:10:47,00:10:51,"Are you getting people to dive into a swimming pool, which is 90 degrees already?"
00:10:51,00:10:54,"Yes, for doing it full of fecal matter on you and..."
00:10:54,00:10:57,"Yeah, if you could put me down for an early shift, please slash that would be great."
00:10:57,00:10:58,So many caveats.
00:10:58,00:11:00,There's an entire thesis of caveats for this.
00:11:00,00:11:04,"But once we've overcome them, this is teemaking for the future."
00:11:04,00:11:13,"Guys, I'm afraid it's not in the idealised realm of physics, but it is an actual fact, so I don't know."
00:11:13,00:11:16,"Okay, so this is about urinating in swimming pools."
00:11:16,00:11:23,"So if a pool is chlorinated and you have a wiener, it creates a chemical called cyanogen chloride."
00:11:23,00:11:24,Do you know this?
00:11:24,00:11:27,And it's toxic.
00:11:27,00:11:29,It reacts with nitrogen.
00:11:29,00:11:31,It's when chlorine reacts with the nitrogen in your urine.
00:11:31,00:11:36,"And it acts basically as tear gas, and cyanogen chloride is classified as an agent of chemical warfare."
00:11:36,00:11:42,"So when you have a pee in the swimming pool, you are technically in breach of the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons."
00:11:42,00:11:44,You are a war criminal.
00:11:44,00:11:45,If you are a swimming pool.
00:11:45,00:11:49,"If you don't report it to the OPCW, then yeah."
00:11:49,00:11:52,That is actually a bit more idealised experiment than mine.
00:11:52,00:11:54,"Well, there is a calculation on this as well."
00:11:54,00:12:00,And it was to see whether you could produce enough cyanogen chloride in this same Olympic sized swimming pool
00:12:00,00:12:02,that we found that was open on Christmas Day.
00:12:02,00:12:03,Is that the boiling one?
00:12:03,00:12:04,Yeah.
00:12:04,00:12:08,That would cause a fatal amount of cyanogen chloride to be created.
00:12:08,00:12:11,So this is done by Casey Johnston at Ars Technica.
00:12:11,00:12:16,And she calculated that what you needed is 2500 parts per billion.
00:12:16,00:12:18,That's a fatal dose of cyanogen chloride.
00:12:18,00:12:24,She said what it turned out you would need is a swimming pool that was two parts water to one part chlorine.
00:12:24,00:12:28,So is anyway completely fatal to swimming before you get it.
00:12:28,00:12:34,And you also need about 3 million people to have a P in it before they were killed by the chlorine in the pool.
00:12:34,00:12:37,So we can't put it to military use just yet.
00:12:37,00:12:40,Wheel pattern pools onto the front line.
00:12:40,00:12:45,"No, it does also make a thing called a trichloramine, which is another lung irritant."
00:12:45,00:12:47,And it makes a tiny bit of chloroform as well.
00:12:47,00:12:50,Who knew that this must be going on when you had a P in the pool?
00:12:50,00:12:53,"There is a way of making flashes boiling pool work, of course."
00:12:53,00:12:58,So you have to do just one simple thing to his pool of water and the people without killing them.
00:12:58,00:13:03,All you have to do is raise the pool up a mere 18 kilometres into the air.
00:13:03,00:13:07,"Well, 18 kilometres in the air, then water will boil at blood temperature."
00:13:07,00:13:09,That's probably a better solution.
00:13:09,00:13:12,"So which would probably be easier, actually, if you just raised up, it's called the Armstrong limit."
00:13:12,00:13:16,"We've made a breakthrough. I mean, people said this is actually very useful."
00:13:16,00:13:22,"But it has been checked because, of course, when pilots are very high, above 18 kilometres you have to wear a precious suit."
00:13:22,00:13:24,I don't know how much oxygen you're getting from oxygen mask.
00:13:24,00:13:27,"Because beyond that point, things like your tears and your saliva start to boil."
00:13:27,00:13:28,Stop boiling.
00:13:28,00:13:34,"There is a recording of an American pilot who said the last thing we remember before blacking out,"
00:13:34,00:13:40,"this is going above 18 kilometres without a precious suit, is feeling the sensation of his saliva boiling on his tongue."
00:13:40,00:13:42,Wow.
00:13:42,00:13:44,That's going to be unpleasant.
00:13:44,00:13:46,Do you know about boiling in space?
00:13:46,00:13:47,This is very cool.
00:13:47,00:13:52,"So this is a thing which hadn't been done, obviously, for decades, because they have more pressing things to go into the moon."
00:13:52,00:13:56,"But obviously, the further up you go, the lower the boiling point of water."
00:13:56,00:14:02,"And in the 1990s, they did a series of experiments on boiling on the space shuttle."
00:14:02,00:14:06,"And they found out that when you boil a kettle, it has thousands of thousands of bubbles."
00:14:06,00:14:10,"When you boil a liquid in space, it just produces one big bubble."
00:14:10,00:14:11,No.
00:14:11,00:14:14,"Then it's hovers up all the other bubbles, it swallows up all the others."
00:14:14,00:14:16,So you just have one massive bubble when your tea is ready.
00:14:16,00:14:17,That's so great.
00:14:17,00:14:21,"I was listening to a podcast the other day called Smart Enough to Know Better,"
00:14:21,00:14:23,"which is an excellent podcast, really interesting."
00:14:23,00:14:28,And they were actually talking about a guy who tries to break records for blowing the biggest bubbles.
00:14:28,00:14:36,"And he was saying once a bubble goes above five metres in diameter, if you puncture it, it no longer pops, it tears."
00:14:36,00:14:37,Isn't that cool?
00:14:37,00:14:40,"So if you blow a gigantic soap bubble, it won't pop anywhere."
00:14:40,00:14:45,"In Edinburgh this year, we were after a show called The Amazing Bubble Man. It was a children's show."
00:14:45,00:14:47,It was unbelievably good.
00:14:47,00:14:49,We're watching a bit of it through the curtains.
00:14:49,00:14:51,Did you feel a bit like a let down after it?
00:14:51,00:14:56,"We couldn't follow it, but all his audience were four-year-olds and all our audience were not four-year-olds."
00:14:56,00:14:57,So it was all right.
00:14:57,00:15:00,"But oh man, so you know, he fills a bubble with smoke."
00:15:00,00:15:05,"He sort of injects a bubble, hypothetically, and then pumps smoke into it and it floats up."
00:15:05,00:15:08,"And when it pops, it produces this weird cloud of smoke."
00:15:08,00:15:12,He has a sort that can sort of slice bubbles in two.
00:15:12,00:15:15,You don't actually need a sort to do that.
00:15:15,00:15:18,You can get in for a moment as far as difficult to obtain or do the same.
00:15:18,00:15:19,That's true.
00:15:19,00:15:20,"Yeah, it's fascinating."
00:15:20,00:15:23,He sort of puts bubbles on people.
00:15:23,00:15:28,"You can put bubbles along the arm of a child, for example, because they don't have hair on the arm."
00:15:28,00:15:31,"But for an adult with more hair on the arm, you can't do that because it doesn't quite work."
00:15:31,00:15:33,"So yeah, all sorts of very interesting stuff."
00:15:33,00:15:34,What about plug for him?
00:15:34,00:15:35,"I know, I know."
00:15:35,00:15:36,It's about how you can't remember his name.
00:15:36,00:15:39,He doesn't need it. He's hugely successful.
00:15:39,00:15:44,"It's just well into, I know, his kind of grotesque, but the business about how the best way to kill a lobster."
00:15:44,00:15:45,Oh yeah.
00:15:45,00:15:48,And because there's a sharply divided opinion between...
00:15:48,00:15:49,Lobsters?
00:15:49,00:15:54,"I mean, you put them in cold water and bring it up to the heat gradually."
00:15:54,00:15:59,And then they sort of go to sleep and then they're inacitized and die without any.
00:15:59,00:16:03,Or else you plunge them into boiling water and that kills them instantly.
00:16:03,00:16:06,Or you stab them in the back.
00:16:06,00:16:09,"Or you don't kill them at all, which is the PETA-Peter position."
00:16:09,00:16:14,"If you do the PETA method and don't kill them, they're going to be very feisty on the plate."
00:16:14,00:16:15,It's no problem.
00:16:15,00:16:16,They are.
00:16:16,00:16:21,"We do know what happens if you boil a human alive, though, because there's a description of one."
00:16:21,00:16:22,"Oh, really?"
00:16:22,00:16:28,"From the reign of Henry VIII, a cook called Richard Rus, who poised the Bishop of Rochester."
00:16:28,00:16:35,"And he got caught and he thought, ""It's a joke. I gave him a purgative. It's just a joke. It's funny. Give him a runny tummy."""
00:16:35,00:16:39,But Henry VIII was incensed and actually put an act of attainment around against him.
00:16:39,00:16:42,So he could be convicted without trial.
00:16:42,00:16:46,Then persuaded the parliament to make poisoning an act of treason.
00:16:46,00:16:51,"Then, when he thought it couldn't get any worse, decided that the penalty for poisoning would be being boiled alive."
00:16:51,00:16:55,"So poor old Richard Rus, who apparently had just had a bit of a joke with his employer,"
00:16:55,00:16:58,and then being boiled alive.
00:16:58,00:17:04,"And there's someone who was actually watched, said he roared mighty loud and diverse women who were big with child,"
00:17:04,00:17:08,"did feel sick at the sight of what they saw, and were carried away half dead."
00:17:08,00:17:14,"And other men and women did not seem frightened by the boiling alive, but would prefer to see the headspin at his work."
00:17:14,00:17:16,What is in the executioner?
00:17:16,00:17:17,The executioner.
00:17:17,00:17:19,There are lots of different views.
00:17:19,00:17:22,"Well, it's as good as having his head cut."
00:17:22,00:17:25,Did that catch on as a means of execution? Or is he unique?
00:17:25,00:17:27,"No, there were a few others. There were actually a few before."
00:17:27,00:17:30,It's often said that Henry VIII invented boiling alive.
00:17:30,00:17:32,"They're actually in Scotland, they're a few."
00:17:32,00:17:39,"There was a layered somewhat earlier, who's upset some of his nobles by apparently being too harsh with them."
00:17:39,00:17:41,And they got together and threw him in a kettle.
00:17:41,00:17:50,"And apparently, then to prove they were all in it together, they all took a glass of the stew that they made by boiling their layered alive and drank it."
00:17:50,00:17:53,Do you guys know about the world's deepest swimming pool?
00:17:53,00:17:56,I don't know about the world's deepest swimming pool.
00:17:56,00:18:01,"There's not actually that much to say about it, except that I like it because it's called The Deep Joy,"
00:18:01,00:18:04,which sounds like a quote from one of Samuel Peep's favorites.
00:18:04,00:18:08,"But I think this is in Belgium, and you can walk through a tunnel at the bottom of it."
00:18:08,00:18:11,"And it's the depth of 9 or 10 double-decker buses, I think."
00:18:11,00:18:12,That's really cool.
00:18:12,00:18:16,"Here's my question though, but what's the point of having a deep end at all in this swimming pool?"
00:18:16,00:18:19,Why don't you just make it all sort of a normal type?
00:18:19,00:18:21,That's annoying. You want to dive down.
00:18:21,00:18:22,"Well not much, particularly."
00:18:22,00:18:25,"I mean, you think it's what you want to understand on your hands and have your feet sticking out, don't you?"
00:18:25,00:18:27,"You could do that, a shallow end flash."
00:18:27,00:18:28,A shallow end flash.
00:18:28,00:18:31,"Otherwise, you have to do all the other noobs up the shallow end."
00:18:31,00:18:35,"And you could have the whole pool, people standing upside down."
00:18:35,00:18:38,Flash has been possibly removed from many public pools.
00:18:38,00:18:43,"No, the only point, if you're going to do a very steep vertical dive."
00:18:43,00:18:44,Yeah.
00:18:44,00:18:48,"Otherwise, I guess they have to build that into the plans of the pool."
00:18:48,00:18:51,"In case someone misses the sign saying, please do not do a steep vertical dive."
00:18:51,00:18:56,"Because following the advice of Pierce Fletcher, we have made the entire pool a depth of only a meter and 30."
00:18:56,00:18:58,Feel free to stand on your hands.
00:18:58,00:19:02,"It makes it really difficult to boil the water, you know, because it's so much more."
00:19:02,00:19:10,"Okay, time for fact number three."
00:19:10,00:19:12,And that is my fact.
00:19:12,00:19:17,"And this is that, in Wales, the size of your garden used to be determined by how far you could throw."
00:19:17,00:19:20,And so this is a tradition in Wales that apparently is very well known.
00:19:20,00:19:24,And I went to the trouble because I don't want to offend anyone of looking up how you pronounce it.
00:19:24,00:19:28,"And it's called te unos, which means one night house."
00:19:28,00:19:32,"And it was this tradition that apparently dates back to the middle ages, according to Welsh folklore,"
00:19:32,00:19:37,which is that if you could build a house within a night and have a fire burning in the hearth
00:19:37,00:19:41,"and smoke coming out of the chimney by the morning, then you own that property."
00:19:41,00:19:45,And then the rule was that you could stand on your hands.
00:19:45,00:19:50,The rule was that you could stand on each of the four corners of your house and throw an axe
00:19:50,00:19:53,and the distance that you threw it marked out the boundaries of your property.
00:19:53,00:19:54,And that's what you owned.
00:19:54,00:19:57,And they continued doing this up until the 19th century.
00:19:57,00:19:58,It was never legally...
00:19:58,00:20:00,I've never found a law.
00:20:00,00:20:01,It was never a legal thing.
00:20:01,00:20:02,I think we just did it.
00:20:02,00:20:04,You get quite a big garden throwing in it.
00:20:04,00:20:05,"Oh, no, no, no."
00:20:05,00:20:10,I'm hugely relieved I didn't live in pre-19th century Wales because I would have had the smallest garden of all of my neighbours.
00:20:10,00:20:15,"There's an actual example of a house, which is, or in fact there's several, where there's one in particular supposed to be built that way."
00:20:15,00:20:16,You know about this and there's no doni at this time.
00:20:16,00:20:17,There's no doni at this time.
00:20:17,00:20:20,"Yes, this is where, because I went on holiday, the ugly house."
00:20:20,00:20:24,"Yeah, I was in Wales last week, so saw it and found out about this thing in an old book."
00:20:24,00:20:29,"But yeah, there is this house in Snowdonia called the ugly house, which is actually really attractive now."
00:20:29,00:20:34,"In a sort of tumble-downy sort of way, but it looks like something out of Hansel and Gressel or something."
00:20:34,00:20:38,And I think that was made by two brothers in the 15th century.
00:20:38,00:20:39,Was it? Was that the legend?
00:20:39,00:20:42,"Well, that's the legend, but apparently they think it's more likely to be in 19th century cottage."
00:20:42,00:20:44,"Yeah, that's more likely to be."
00:20:44,00:20:48,"The other thing is Hill, which is the word they translate as ugly, really doesn't mean ugly in Welsh."
00:20:48,00:20:49,It means rugged.
00:20:49,00:20:50,"Oh, really?"
00:20:50,00:20:51,Much nicer.
00:20:51,00:20:52,It does look rugged.
00:20:52,00:20:53,Yeah.
00:20:53,00:20:59,"Well, a load of the houses that tea in us houses were obviously not very good because they'd been built in a night."
00:20:59,00:21:01,So a load of them were torn down.
00:21:01,00:21:05,But then they were replaced later on by more modern cottages on the same site.
00:21:05,00:21:09,"They'd just nip into your garden, build a shade overnight, light a fire in it, throw me acts,"
00:21:09,00:21:11,and you wake up in the morning to find that I own half your garden.
00:21:11,00:21:12,Yeah.
00:21:12,00:21:14,And then later I build a very nice house on that.
00:21:14,00:21:18,"A nice conservatory on the side, and then there's a swimming pool in place of my house when I've gone out."
00:21:18,00:21:19,"Yeah, but it happened."
00:21:19,00:21:21,"I'd welcome you, Justin."
00:21:21,00:21:27,"I was just going to say you see, it might not be a law, but you can see how it's the kind of thing that people would believe."
00:21:27,00:21:29,Or at least they'll talk about it in the pub.
00:21:29,00:21:31,"Apparently, you know, if you do this."
00:21:31,00:21:35,"And then you can say, well, let's do it, and they go out and they do it, and then we'll have a laugh, and then they see if they can get away with it."
00:21:35,00:21:37,"The pen's been on notices, I suppose, isn't it, really?"
00:21:37,00:21:38,Yeah.
00:21:38,00:21:45,"I mean, there is a law of adverse possession in the UK, which changed in 2012, but still exists, whereby if it's called squatters relics,"
00:21:45,00:21:46,it's a short hand for it.
00:21:46,00:21:53,"And if you own a piece of land and act like the proprietor of it for long enough, then it can become your land."
00:21:53,00:21:55,Do you have to be in it for seven years or something?
00:21:55,00:21:56,Twelve years.
00:21:56,00:22:03,"Well, you can't now go and score in someone else's house if it's their home, and then wait for the process, you know, have them appeal to the courts."
00:22:03,00:22:05,You can immediately be chucked out for that now.
00:22:05,00:22:05,That's good.
00:22:05,00:22:11,"You could even create your own private beach, because you know, most of the foreland in Britain is owned by the crown."
00:22:11,00:22:17,That's the bin between sort of midway between the neat and the spring high tide mark and the ocean is owned by the crown.
00:22:17,00:22:21,"But if you wanted your own beach, there were just a couple of simple things you have to do."
00:22:21,00:22:28,"You have to find a nice, quiet beach somewhere, put up a sign saying private keep out, as you often see on beaches, actually, even though they're not."
00:22:28,00:22:33,"You could put up a little fence, don't have to, but it's nice to put up a little fence, just show that you're carrying for the land."
00:22:33,00:22:40,"Roll up your trousers, take your socks off, go for a paddle, and all you have to do is stay there for 60 years, and the beach is yours."
00:22:40,00:22:41,60 years!
00:22:41,00:22:43,"60 years of paddling, and the beach is yours."
00:22:43,00:22:47,You didn't know how many Olympic swimming pools you could boil in that time.
00:22:47,00:22:50,You don't actually have to be literally on the beach all that time.
00:22:50,00:22:57,And I do wonder if those people who put up private beach signs are actually waiting for 60 years to then say they now own the foreshore.
00:22:57,00:23:00,"I wouldn't have the nows to do this before the age of, let's say, 20."
00:23:00,00:23:03,"So by the age of 80, you'll have a beach."
00:23:03,00:23:05,"It's a gift for the crown, isn't it?"
00:23:05,00:23:09,"It's like planting trees, you know, stealing a foreshore."
00:23:09,00:23:12,So this thing about throwing a thing and seeing how far it lands.
00:23:12,00:23:18,"I looked into it, and I found a book called The History of the Germanic Empire Volume 3, which was published in 1835."
00:23:18,00:23:19,Best volume?
00:23:19,00:23:21,It's an absolute cracker.
00:23:21,00:23:23,And it describes a load of these customs.
00:23:23,00:23:32,So a shepherd could see how far he could drive his flock into someone else's forest by throwing his crook as far as he could.
00:23:32,00:23:35,"Or wherever it lands, you can drive your sheep in that far."
00:23:35,00:23:39,Or a woodcutter could cut wood according to how far he could throw his axe.
00:23:39,00:23:40,Could you only throw it once or...?
00:23:40,00:23:41,I don't know.
00:23:41,00:23:45,The history of The Germanic Empire Volume 3 is pretty sketchy on details.
00:23:45,00:23:54,"But I just found this other custom which I thought I had to share with you, which is if you kill someone else's dog to make restitution to them,"
00:23:54,00:23:58,what you had to do is hang it up by the tail with its nose just touching the ground.
00:23:58,00:24:00,And then you had to cover it with wheat.
00:24:00,00:24:01,So it was completely invisible.
00:24:01,00:24:03,So you completely covered the whole dog with wheat.
00:24:03,00:24:08,And then that heap of wheat is the compensation that's due to the person whose dog who kills.
00:24:08,00:24:12,Heap of wheat covered in dog cock is so precious.
00:24:12,00:24:14,"If it's a toy dog, then you're fine."
00:24:14,00:24:17,That's just a small loaf of bread you shove it into in your sausage.
00:24:17,00:24:22,"The thing about throwing the axe, the way they found out how much your territorial waters were internationally,"
00:24:22,00:24:25,were how far you could fire a cannon back in the day.
00:24:25,00:24:29,"In fact, not even know that long ago under international law."
00:24:29,00:24:35,"Until the mid-20th century, territorial waters were decided it were three nautical miles, which was the length of the cannon."
00:24:35,00:24:36,No!
00:24:36,00:24:39,And the idea was that that was the distance that you could dominate the sea.
00:24:39,00:24:40,Defensible distance.
00:24:40,00:24:42,"Wait, you could fire a cannon three miles."
00:24:42,00:24:43,Three nautical miles.
00:24:43,00:24:45,Of course you could fire a six-kilometre.
00:24:45,00:24:47,"Spain claimed six nautical miles, but that was unusual."
00:24:47,00:24:52,And the United Kingdom only extended from three miles to twelve in 1987.
00:24:52,00:24:55,I really thought when we suddenly got a cannon upgrade.
00:24:55,00:24:56,Got a bigger gun.
00:24:56,00:24:59,"Yeah, these days you've got cruise missiles, which can go quite a long way."
00:24:59,00:25:00,So you could make a pretty good claim.
00:25:00,00:25:02,So I think that doesn't work anymore.
00:25:02,00:25:03,That's how it worked out.
00:25:03,00:25:04,"Wow, that's interesting."
00:25:04,00:25:05,So it's actually such a...
00:25:05,00:25:11,"And you'd presumably, these Welsh guys were saying, ""Well, I can defend this house as far as I can throw this axe."""
00:25:11,00:25:14,But then you have to go out and get the axe from a limitless approach.
00:25:14,00:25:16,You're still a big deal in North Wales.
00:25:16,00:25:17,Is it?
00:25:17,00:25:18,"Yeah, apparently."
00:25:18,00:25:19,"In fact, here's the interesting thing."
00:25:19,00:25:24,"At this moment, there is a thing that's taking place, which is called the Good Life Experience."
00:25:24,00:25:25,And Howard and the State of North Wales.
00:25:25,00:25:30,And Karris Matthews runs an annual axe throwing competition there.
00:25:30,00:25:31,I know who that is.
00:25:31,00:25:32,"Yeah, she said."
00:25:32,00:25:34,"You know, Karris Matthews."
00:25:34,00:25:38,"Karris Matthews and some other people, but she's the one I'd heard of."
00:25:38,00:25:39,So it's Karris Matthews.
00:25:39,00:25:40,"Yes, that is."
00:25:40,00:25:42,"Well, it's becoming a trend here."
00:25:42,00:25:46,"And James Harkin, formerly of this podcast, has done axe throwing with his wife, Felina,"
00:25:46,00:25:48,and said it was the best one he's ever had.
00:25:48,00:25:49,I think there's one in Sheditch.
00:25:49,00:25:51,The best for e-lives are quite nice.
00:25:51,00:25:53,"Well, we should read peeps."
00:25:53,00:25:59,"But they are still, apparently, people still use Tomahorks in a military sense."
00:25:59,00:26:00,This is true.
00:26:00,00:26:01,This is true.
00:26:01,00:26:08,"I think in the Korean War, people actually brought throwing axes as part of their gear."
00:26:08,00:26:10,The Americans brought throwing axes.
00:26:10,00:26:14,"Here's the thing about Tomahorks, which I did not know, is that loads of Native American Tomahorks"
00:26:14,00:26:18,had hollow handles and could be used to smoke through.
00:26:18,00:26:22,"And basically, if some Native Americans met some white settlers,"
00:26:22,00:26:24,it could go one of two ways.
00:26:24,00:26:28,"You use the axe either to hit them or you sort of, you come to some sort of agreement"
00:26:28,00:26:30,and then you smoke together to seal the deal.
00:26:30,00:26:31,That's amazing.
00:26:31,00:26:35,"In the film, you see the shadow of this shape and be holding it up"
00:26:35,00:26:37,and then you cut and he's a piece fight.
00:26:37,00:26:39,That's a guy.
00:26:39,00:26:41,That would work.
00:26:41,00:26:45,"This is so random, but I discovered, since we're talking about America and Wales,"
00:26:45,00:26:48,that the first Welsh settler in America was called Howell Power.
00:26:48,00:26:49,Howell Power.
00:26:49,00:26:50,I like that.
00:26:50,00:26:54,"But anyway, I was actually going to talk about squatting in America generally."
00:26:54,00:26:57,"In 2004, a woman in Georgia came over from a holiday."
00:26:57,00:26:59,And there was a car in her drive.
00:26:59,00:27:01,And all the lights were right in her house.
00:27:01,00:27:03,And so she went into her house.
00:27:03,00:27:07,"There was a stranger in there, a woman, who was wearing all this woman's clothes."
00:27:07,00:27:10,She changed all her utility bills into her name.
00:27:10,00:27:14,She'd installed her washing machine and she'd installed a dryer and she'd moved her dog in.
00:27:14,00:27:17,"And this woman had just moved in, pretended to be her."
00:27:17,00:27:19,"So the lady arrived home, said, get out of my house."
00:27:19,00:27:21,And we have no idea why she did that.
00:27:21,00:27:24,She'd ripped out a carpet. She didn't like how one room was painted.
00:27:24,00:27:25,So she re-painted it.
00:27:25,00:27:26,What happened?
00:27:26,00:27:27,She went to prison.
00:27:27,00:27:28,The which one did?
00:27:28,00:27:30,The right moment.
00:27:30,00:27:33,"I mean, that's a film, isn't it?"
00:27:33,00:27:34,Who's house is it?
00:27:34,00:27:36,This lunatic turned up claiming to be me and it was my house.
00:27:36,00:27:40,That's a good teleformat is who actually owns the house.
00:27:40,00:27:44,And you get the two claimants and you have to ask them questions about where are the switches?
00:27:44,00:27:47,"If a light goes the trip switches, you know?"
00:27:47,00:27:49,Squatting through the keyhole.
00:27:49,00:27:51,Who would squat in a house like this?
00:27:51,00:27:52,Yeah!
00:27:58,00:28:01,"Okay, we should move on to our final fact and that is from Andy."
00:28:01,00:28:06,My fact is that some caterpillars find new friends by drumming on their anuses.
00:28:06,00:28:07,Work on me?
00:28:07,00:28:08,Yeah.
00:28:08,00:28:12,"So this actually, this fact was sent in by somebody by Gourish Chawler."
00:28:12,00:28:14,So thank you very much for sending us in.
00:28:14,00:28:15,I liked it so much.
00:28:15,00:28:18,This is the masked birch caterpillar.
00:28:18,00:28:21,And it lives on birch leaves and it spins cocoons out of silk.
00:28:21,00:28:27,But sometimes they need a lot of caterpillars to join in the silk cocoon ceremony
00:28:27,00:28:28,and maintain their hiding place.
00:28:28,00:28:30,So what they do is they do anal drumming.
00:28:30,00:28:32,So they bang their anuses on the ground.
00:28:32,00:28:33,They drum their anus on the leaf.
00:28:33,00:28:35,And it summons the other caterpillars.
00:28:35,00:28:40,"But they're very versatile because also if they have rivals and they want to scare a rival away sometimes,"
00:28:40,00:28:43,then they will do anal scraping.
00:28:43,00:28:44,That's different from anal drumming.
00:28:44,00:28:45,"Oh, yeah."
00:28:45,00:28:47,As we all know.
00:28:47,00:28:50,So they have a thing called an anal awe.
00:28:50,00:28:51,And they...
00:28:51,00:28:52,Law what?
00:28:54,00:28:57,Not a choice I want to be presented with.
00:28:57,00:29:00,If you don't have a very strong musical ear as a caterpillar
00:29:00,00:29:04,"and you misinterpret the come hither for the trouble please,"
00:29:04,00:29:06,"then yeah, you're really in trouble."
00:29:06,00:29:07,Yeah.
00:29:07,00:29:10,"Well, the thing is that there's a recording of this thing online."
00:29:10,00:29:11,You found that.
00:29:11,00:29:14,But there's the woman who researches it says you can't really hear it.
00:29:14,00:29:17,"But if you get a laser vibrometer, you hear this crazy rumbling sound."
00:29:17,00:29:19,They actually sound like lions.
00:29:19,00:29:20,Really tiny lions.
00:29:20,00:29:22,"She's called Jane Yak, this researcher."
00:29:22,00:29:25,And she says they talk to themselves with their asses as well.
00:29:25,00:29:27,Talking with their butts even when they were alone.
00:29:27,00:29:30,"When feeding they go chomp, chomp, chomp, anal scrape."
00:29:30,00:29:32,"Chomp, chomp, chomp."
00:29:32,00:29:34,Nothing unusual about that.
00:29:34,00:29:37,I don't get invited to many dinner parties.
00:29:37,00:29:41,The Alcon Blue caterpillar also makes a scraping noise.
00:29:41,00:29:43,But not for other caterpillars.
00:29:43,00:29:48,It makes a scraping noise that red ants mistake for a queen red ant.
00:29:48,00:29:51,And it releases a sort of a chemical that smells like them as well.
00:29:51,00:29:54,So the red ants then take the caterpillar into their ant hill.
00:29:54,00:29:57,Kick out the actual queen ant.
00:29:57,00:30:01,The caterpillar sits there eating the larvae to which the ants don't seem at all bothered.
00:30:01,00:30:04,"Because it smells like a queen, it looks like it doesn't look like it."
00:30:04,00:30:06,"But it smells like a queen, it's making a queen you sort of noise."
00:30:06,00:30:10,"Right up until the moment when it pupates and it stays in there protected by the ants,"
00:30:10,00:30:11,then it bursts out.
00:30:11,00:30:14,At which point all the ants go wait a minute.
00:30:14,00:30:17,"There's a butterfly in the middle of the ant hill, which is unusual."
00:30:17,00:30:20,But they're covered in really loose scales when they come out.
00:30:20,00:30:23,So the ants make a grab for it and all the scales just come off.
00:30:23,00:30:25,And it just climbs out and flies away.
00:30:25,00:30:26,"Brilliant, that's amazing."
00:30:26,00:30:27,Brilliant.
00:30:27,00:30:29,Is our own queen actually the queen?
00:30:29,00:30:31,Or is she just an enormous caterpillar?
00:30:31,00:30:33,"Imagine if one year for the state opening of Parliament,"
00:30:33,00:30:36,she comes out and she seems to be covered in these loose scales.
00:30:36,00:30:37,"Oh, what's going on there?"
00:30:37,00:30:39,Oh they floor to be a crab.
00:30:39,00:30:42,Do you know they have carnivorous caterpillars in Hawaii?
00:30:42,00:30:43,What are they?
00:30:43,00:30:44,Beef.
00:30:44,00:30:45,They eat snails.
00:30:45,00:30:48,They trap the snail in the silken noose and then they eat it alive
00:30:48,00:30:53,"because the snail can't move and the caterpillar sort of goes into the hole,"
00:30:53,00:30:55,"the front door, as it were."
00:30:55,00:30:58,And the snail tries to withdraw further and further into its own shell.
00:30:58,00:31:01,Then it runs out of space and then gets eaten alive and eat the whole thing.
00:31:01,00:31:03,"That's a rough way to go, packed into a corner."
00:31:03,00:31:05,They should have covered this.
00:31:05,00:31:07,He's called Daniel Rubinoff.
00:31:07,00:31:09,He said almost all insects are predators.
00:31:09,00:31:12,"But to find a caterpillar going after snails are real shocked,"
00:31:12,00:31:15,it's like finding a wolf diving for clams.
00:31:15,00:31:19,"Well, we'll have to take his word with that, I suppose, because he's the expert."
00:31:19,00:31:20,That would be a shock.
00:31:20,00:31:21,I would be a man.
00:31:21,00:31:24,"If I was a snail, I would have a trap door in the back of my shell."
00:31:24,00:31:25,Or a panic room.
00:31:25,00:31:26,"Which, yes."
00:31:26,00:31:27,Marine shells do.
00:31:27,00:31:28,They have an apurculum.
00:31:28,00:31:31,They have a little trap door they can close up their shell.
00:31:31,00:31:33,"Speaking of the words, ""back door."""
00:31:33,00:31:37,"Oh, no, I have a fact about, because the fact is about anal drumming."
00:31:37,00:31:41,I have a fact about the giant California sea cucumber.
00:31:41,00:31:47,"It's a lovely organism, lives in the ocean, and it uses its anus as a mouth,"
00:31:47,00:31:50,in spite of already having a mouth.
00:31:50,00:31:52,Or does it use its mouth?
00:31:52,00:31:54,It uses its mouth as a mouth.
00:31:54,00:31:55,It's very greedy.
00:31:55,00:31:59,"But then when there's food around, it's sort of like, ""Oh, I haven't been in half a bit of my bum."""
00:31:59,00:32:04,"That's the series of tubes which go up from its bottom,"
00:32:04,00:32:07,"and it gets water in through those tubes, and it sucks the oxygen out of the water."
00:32:07,00:32:09,That's how it gets its oxygen.
00:32:09,00:32:13,"But it also has these blood vessels, and they found that food has been making its way"
00:32:13,00:32:15,through these blood vessels from the bottom.
00:32:15,00:32:17,So that's how they're food.
00:32:17,00:32:18,Brilliant.
00:32:18,00:32:21,"On anuses, actually, I was reading about scorpions anuses,"
00:32:21,00:32:28,"and scorpions sometimes lose their anuses in, you know, some creatures do auto-totomy."
00:32:28,00:32:29,Yes.
00:32:29,00:32:33,"But the problem with scorpions, these particular scorpions, is that they commit auto-tomy."
00:32:33,00:32:37,"So if you threaten them from behind, then they drop their tail off."
00:32:37,00:32:39,But their anuses at the end of their tail.
00:32:39,00:32:43,"So once they've done that, they can no longer defecate."
00:32:43,00:32:44,Or sting.
00:32:44,00:32:45,"Or sting, indeed."
00:32:45,00:32:48,So they just wave around randomly a little butt.
00:32:48,00:32:52,"In fact, the guy who discovered this, a guy called Matoni, said that once it had lost its tail,"
00:32:52,00:32:56,he could see the build-up of fecal matter in the back of it.
00:32:56,00:32:58,"I've got a photograph of it, haven't I?"
00:32:58,00:32:59,Yeah.
00:32:59,00:33:00,And they can't grow it back.
00:33:00,00:33:01,They can't grow it back.
00:33:01,00:33:08,"The thing is, they can breed in the before they die, you know what I mean?"
00:33:08,00:33:10,They can bring up a family and pay the school fees.
00:33:10,00:33:11,So there's no problem?
00:33:11,00:33:12,It's not a good chat up line though.
00:33:12,00:33:14,It's not a good chat up line though.
00:33:14,00:33:16,It's like losing your hair.
00:33:16,00:33:19,You can still breed before you die.
00:33:19,00:33:20,Yeah.
00:33:20,00:33:21,In principle.
00:33:21,00:33:25,"There is a tiny species of jaw worm, which doesn't have a common name."
00:33:25,00:33:28,"It's called haplornatia, which has a transient anus."
00:33:28,00:33:30,"For most of the time, it doesn't have a bottom."
00:33:30,00:33:34,"And it eats things, and when it needs a bottom, a bottom appears for a while."
00:33:34,00:33:38,"It uses the bottom, and then the bottom goes away again."
00:33:38,00:33:39,That's so useful.
00:33:39,00:33:40,"Yeah, transient anus."
00:33:40,00:33:42,Think how useful that would be.
00:33:42,00:33:44,"I can imagine supermodels wanting to invest in that sort of thing,"
00:33:44,00:33:48,because an anus isn't actually that appealing body part.
00:33:48,00:33:50,"I know they say a lot of things would be a good name for a band,"
00:33:50,00:33:54,but transient anus would be a fantastic name for a band.
00:33:54,00:33:55,Matoni worms.
00:33:55,00:33:59,Do you know the larvae of the emperum off?
00:33:59,00:34:01,"It's said in the thing I read commonly eaten in Africa,"
00:34:01,00:34:04,but the Africa is always used to mean just this like a brew.
00:34:04,00:34:08,"And you eat it by squeezing it like a tube of toothpaste,"
00:34:08,00:34:10,and then giving a quick flick of the wrist
00:34:10,00:34:13,to expel the slimy green contents of the gut.
00:34:13,00:34:15,And it's a nutritious snack.
00:34:15,00:34:18,"And there's a bloke who was caught at Gatwick,"
00:34:18,00:34:21,"with four sacks of these things,"
00:34:21,00:34:23,which confiscated and destroyed.
00:34:23,00:34:26,"And the customs said they were worth £40,000."
00:34:26,00:34:27,What?
00:34:27,00:34:29,"I know, but I looked up the cost,"
00:34:29,00:34:32,"and you could buy £40,000 in for £16.99 online,"
00:34:32,00:34:34,"which means that if it really was £40,000 worth,"
00:34:34,00:34:36,this is in 2013.
00:34:36,00:34:39,He must have been carrying the same weight as a baby elephant.
00:34:39,00:34:40,I saw that.
00:34:40,00:34:42,I think it was about 100 kilos.
00:34:42,00:34:45,And he claimed that they were for personal consumption.
00:34:45,00:34:46,Exactly that.
00:34:46,00:34:50,How was he getting that much into the luggage?
00:34:50,00:34:53,He just packed your backpack really densely.
00:34:53,00:34:54,You could get away with a lot of them.
00:34:54,00:34:57,You cannot squeeze that into one of those tiny little wire containers
00:34:57,00:34:59,that they easy to check in.
00:34:59,00:35:00,"Well, he didn't..."
00:35:00,00:35:02,I don't know if it may not have been hand luggage.
00:35:02,00:35:03,"This was an unusual seizure,"
00:35:03,00:35:06,but the vigilance of our officers has stopped these dried inscriptions
00:35:06,00:35:08,from entering the UK.
00:35:08,00:35:09,Right.
00:35:09,00:35:11,And possibly posing a risk to our food chain.
00:35:11,00:35:13,A bit of a tingrid smith.
00:35:13,00:35:15,That's the smoke smith for the UK Board Regency talk.
00:35:15,00:35:17,I love the idea that you need vigilance to spot
00:35:17,00:35:20,100 kilos of dried caterpillars in sacks.
00:35:20,00:35:28,"Okay, that's all of our facts today."
00:35:28,00:35:30,"If you'd like to get in contact with any of us here,"
00:35:30,00:35:32,you can get in touch with the others on Twitter.
00:35:32,00:35:34,And he's on...

00:35:37,00:35:38,Flash.
00:35:38,00:35:39,That is retro.
00:35:39,00:35:41,"Wow, they all have Twitter accounts."
00:35:41,00:35:42,I didn't think either of you would.
00:35:42,00:35:43,What's your account?
00:35:43,00:35:45,"My account is an email address,"
00:35:45,00:35:47,"which is podcast@QI.com,"
00:35:47,00:35:49,"or you can go to @QIPodcast,"

00:35:58,00:35:59,First year of fish.
00:35:59,00:36:00,That's all for this week.
00:36:00,00:36:01,See you again next week.
