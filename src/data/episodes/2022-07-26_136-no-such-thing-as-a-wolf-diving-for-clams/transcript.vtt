00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.120
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.720
 to you from the QI Officers in Covenant Garden.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.860
 My name is Antigensky, I am here with Andrew Hunter Murray, and this week we are joined

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:36.700
 by two great pillars of QI, the producer of QI, Piers Fletcher, and one of QI's longest

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:42.780
 serving been there for a million years, researchers and historian Justin Pollard.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.500
 And once again, we've gathered around the microphones with our four favourite facts in the last

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.780
 seven days, and in no particular audit here we go, starting with you Justin.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:57.580
 Okay, so the first person recorded ever buying a pornographic book in England was Samuel

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.500
 Peep's.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.220
 So how was he recorded?

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.060
 Typically idiotically, he managed to record it himself, because he knows Peep's wrote

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.100
 this sort of 10-year diary, which is great, he records a great fire of London and the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.940
 plague and all sorts of big events, but the main use of it is he records the details

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.920
 of his everyday life, and he wrote in his diary that he'd seen the idol Rogish book Les

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.260
 Shoulder Fee which I have bought in plain binding, and he takes it home and he reads it, but

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.620
 then he promises himself in his diary, which is written in short-hand, so nobody else can

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.820
 read it, that as soon as I've read it, I will burn it, which as far as we know he did.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.740
 There's only one copy left of this book in the world.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.740
 Wow.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.020
 So he burned it in order to save himself the embarrassment of having it found among his

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.820
 collection, but then he recorded the fact that he'd read it in his diary.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.300
 He felt the clearest prose of history.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.580
 When he bought it, he wrote in his diary, well I was thinking about getting it, because

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.940
 in French, it would be a good translation tool for my wife, and then I think he saw what

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.740
 was in it and thought maybe not.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.780
 Yeah, but the great thing is that he found it and then he went away for a month nearly.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.300
 It's obviously been praying on his mind, he could have gone, "I might just go down the

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.300
 strand."

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.500
 And then eventually, "Oh, look, is that bookshop again?"

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.420
 And then he's apparently stayed there and he hang about in the bookshop for an hour before

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.820
 actually buying it.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.660
 In a plane binding.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.660
 Exactly.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.420
 So sorry, was the plane binding in the same way as the adults read Harry Potter with a different

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.420
 binding?

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.420
 Yeah, exactly.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.060
 It was just so that, you know, when he's got only a shelf at home, it doesn't say pornographic

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.060
 book.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.100
 He says the reason is because he was cheaper in plane binding and he only took it home in order

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.100
 to destroy it.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.100
 No one destroyed it.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.100
 This is a diary.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.620
 He tends to know what else to read, but he's lying to himself, and it's the only thing.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.740
 It is work, because at the end of his diaries, because he gave up after about ten

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.460
 years, the personal diary, because of his eyesight was failing.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.460
 He was making him blind.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.460
 Yeah.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.460
 That's right.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.460
 Yeah.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.140
 And he said, "I'm going to keep going with my other diary," because he kept another diary

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.380
 going, but it was just official engagements and things like that.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.620
 And it was being kept for him by other people.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.020
 So he said, "I'll have to put in only what I can decently tell other people, and which

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.460
 I will be sure won't get out."

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.300
 Did he mean that for it to be seen?

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.300
 Do we know?

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.860
 We don't know for his private diary.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.060
 Certainly it is, not during his lifetime, not by his wife, obviously.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.740
 So he does recall sort of every detail in it, and he has numerous affairs.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.300
 But the funny thing is, he obviously must be very conflicted, because he's writing it,

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.100
 as you say, in code.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.260
 But at the same time, he copies it out in fair, and puts it into leatherbounds, I think,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.260
 and makes sure that it's...

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.900
 So there must be some parvin that was saying somebody's going to read this and enjoy this

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:35.900
 one day.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.900
 Otherwise, you know, why would you bother him?

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.300
 I think he must have thought.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.700
 I think that's like teenagers do that all the time, don't they?

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.980
 Right about their boyfriends and pretend that they want to hide the knowledge of it and

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:45.980
 leave it carefully.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.780
 But in a long time, in the future, it will be lovely when people get to read about my life.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.620
 I think what he had was an early case of Port noise complaint.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.140
 Port noise complaint is a disorder in which strongly felt ethical and altruistic impulses

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.900
 are perpetually worrying with extreme sexual longings of a perverse nature.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.780
 Yeah, because he does say he's, there's nothing wrong with a decent man, a morally upstanding

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.740
 man reading material like that, for the sake of educating himself.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:10.740
 And he justifies himself.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.420
 As they did right into the 19th century with the secret room of the British Museum,

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.340
 which contained all the sort of phallic statuary and things that were considered inappropriate

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.340
 for the public.

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.540
 There was a secret museum at Naples, and it's exactly the same thing.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.940
 All the erotic art that was found at Pompey and Herculaneum, so there's a statue of the

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.740
 god Pan, sort of, he's getting off with a goat.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.500
 Yes, that's extraordinary, he really is, they really are in a loving embrace.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.500
 Definitely, yeah.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.100
 And that is the same thing that happened.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.500
 Pompey had these erotic frescoes, and they had locked metal cabinets put over them.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.660
 But if you were a gentleman and you paid a small fee, they would remove the locked metal

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.660
 cabinet from the top of the fresco, and you could see it.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.900
 But if you're a woman, no dice, I'm afraid, Anna.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.220
 The interesting thing is, what you're saying is the first recorded instance of by your

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.940
 own buying pornography, but apparently what happened was, most pornography at that time

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.060
 was circulated in the form of manuscript, miscellaneous, that people would keep, people

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.660
 would keep a miscellany of these kinds of things, but also recipes and political tracks and school

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.180
 exercises, and they'd just keep them all bound together for themselves and to give to their

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.180
 friends.

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.660
 But there was only ever one copy of each one.

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:18.660
 I've got one here.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:24.940
 This is the guy, I mean, Anthony Scattergood, who was a theologian in English.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:30.540
 In his miscellany, he has an erotic poem called "On Six Cambridge Mades Bailing Themselves

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.740
 by Queen's College" during the 15th, 1629, which is quite good.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.060
 And then immediately after that is a recipe that says, "For the eyes, take snails and prick

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.660
 them through the shells with a great pin, and they will issue out a fat water, drop the

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.500
 same into the eyes evening and morning."

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.500
 Wow.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.060
 And you know, so that, frankly, probably less attractive than the six...

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:54.220
 Anyway, that was the kind of thing they just gathered together in this miscellany.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.340
 And often in verse form as well, because if it was in verse, it was a sort of a little bit

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:02.860
 less sort of graphic, it was a bit more arty if it was in verse, so best selling pornographic

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.460
 verses of the 15th century is a book called "The Tale of Two Lovers" in Ginoe wrote it.

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.180
 Oh, that was the Pope's one, wasn't it?

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.700
 He was Pope-Past, the second.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:11.700
 Wow.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.660
 This was to be fair before he became Pope, then he wrote this book.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.180
 All the Popes have a past, don't they?

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.380
 So there was the goalkeeper and there was the Hitler-Euth guy, as you know.

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.380
 Yeah.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.100
 And the one who wrote "The Tale of Two Lovers."

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.100
 That is saucy of the most Popes.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.100
 Samuel Piebs.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.100
 Samuel Piebs.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.100
 Samuel Piebs.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:33.900
 My favourite line in all the diaries is he woke up and he was going down into the cellar

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:38.700
 and his exact words are "and put my foot into a great heap of turds by mistake."

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.780
 That's just very funny.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:45.940
 One of the only things I knew about Samuel Piebs is that he buried his parmesan during

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:46.940
 the Great Fire of London.

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:47.940
 Oh, yes.

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:51.940
 I did not know that he was involved in the Great Fire of London, and then he went to visit...

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:52.940
 He's not at it.

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:53.940
 Yeah?

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:57.740
 No, he went to visit the King halfway through and advised the King, "Will you need

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:01.820
 to pull down the houses where the fire hasn't got to yet and make what they call a fire

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:02.820
 break?"

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:03.980
 So it doesn't spread outside that area.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.060
 Didn't he say he also said that the fire of London went on for months and months after

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.060
 we thought it did?

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.060
 So I think it was still burning in March the following year.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.060
 What?

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:12.060
 Yeah.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:13.060
 It's not weird.

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.060
 And it started in September, so I think...

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.060
 No.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.060
 Really?

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.060
 Really strange.

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:20.900
 Another thing I didn't know about him was that he sort of wore spectacles, which he was

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.460
 very impressed by and thought worked really well.

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:29.340
 But what they were was paper tubes, which had been invented a few decades earlier.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:33.180
 And they were just rolled up bits of black paper and they were wider at the eye end than

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:39.300
 they were at the reading end, and so they focused right in on tiny lettering, and it kind of

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:40.300
 worked.

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.300
 I guess it gets rid of...

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.300
 You're glad?

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:43.300
 Well, it's a small aperture, isn't it?

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:47.060
 You know how with a camera, people don't use old fashion cameras, but with a small aperture

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:50.060
 on the lens, you get a much greater depth of field and you're just using that effect.

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:55.140
 You know, he said that Nero had emeralds polished as glasses, so for his reading, but he was Nero.

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:56.140
 Yeah.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:08:00.140
 And that's probably a made-up story.

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:06.900
 OK, let's move on to fact number two, and that is from Pizz.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.900
 Yeah, this is me.

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:15.020
 My fact is that if 50 people swam continuously for 15 months in an Olympic-sized swimming pool,

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.500
 the water would boil.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:17.500
 Ha!

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.500
 Have you worked that out?

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:20.500
 Yeah.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.500
 I've got the physics.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:22.500
 The thing is...

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:23.500
 It's rubbish.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:27.260
 The physics, you know, basically doesn't work, but so what we do...

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:31.020
 It's an idealised model, but what this comes from is the general James Jewel, after whom

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:35.820
 the Jewel is named, named, and a Jewel is the amount of energy it takes to lift a tomato

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:38.060
 one metre from the ground.

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:39.060
 But the thing is...

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:40.060
 I'll bigger tomato.

00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:41.060
 A hundred-gram tomato.

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:42.060
 Right.

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:43.060
 Standard tomato.

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:45.060
 Oh, you're a standard European tomato.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.060
 Yeah.

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:49.340
 Anyway, it's also the point is it's also the amount of energy released when you drop the

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:52.900
 tomato back to the ground, and that each of those is one Jewel.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.860
 And the point about that is conservation of energy.

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.740
 You can't create a destroy energy, only converted from one for another.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:01.620
 So, if you have people swimming around, they raise the temperature of the water, and he

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:05.700
 demonstrated this, and he had a tank, which was sealed, and he had a paddle in it, and

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:06.700
 a rope, which...

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:10.140
 Or a string of something that came out of the top over a pulley, and then he had a weight

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:15.060
 on the end, and the weight drops, turns the paddle, and he measures the temperature of

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:19.300
 the water, and is able to demonstrate that the amount of energy from the dropping

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:25.940
 weight is exactly equal to the amount of energy from the increase in temperature in the water.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:26.940
 So...

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.660
 Does it matter what stroke you'd be doing?

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:30.660
 No.

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:32.660
 It's just about your body heat.

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:33.660
 Well, that's the other thing.

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:34.660
 It's not about your body heat.

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:37.860
 For the purposes of this calculation, I've excluded the body heat effect.

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:38.860
 Right.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:42.420
 If you excluded the fact that if you put people in 50 degree water, they tend to sort of

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:43.420
 stop functioning.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:44.420
 Certainly after 15 months.

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:51.420
 I've got various things that need to be left out of the calculation here in often making

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:52.420
 work.

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:54.420
 One of them is that the water, in this idealised swimming pool, doesn't radiate heat

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:55.420
 away.

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:57.820
 They create all stays there.

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:02.420
 The other is that there's nothing to do with the body heat, and the other thing is that

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:06.420
 you have to find a swimming pool that's open on Christmas Day, because otherwise...

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:11.300
 That is the hardest thing, as opposed to the laws of thermodynamics, which are easy to

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:12.300
 move around.

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.300
 Is it a lido that we're looking for?

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:18.300
 Yeah, and the other thing actually, which makes it difficult, is an Olympic-sized swimming pool.

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.300
 You know, this does not have a standard size.

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:21.300
 Really?

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.300
 The depth is not standard.

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:26.100
 It can be anything from two metres to three metres.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:29.300
 The pool in my illustration, I'm not going to actually run till these numbers, so I'm

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.580
 looking at this, but it's two metres deep.

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:37.420
 It starts at 20 degrees, it would take 11,200 hours, which is 466 days, to raise the temperature

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.220
 by 80 degrees from that.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:44.020
 And the other thing, of course, you've got to contend with, is what point people die.

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:47.220
 You can replace them, though, so you could just have substitutes to simply just stand in.

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:51.220
 Are you getting people to dive into a swimming pool, which is 90 degrees already?

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:54.220
 Yes, for doing it full of fecal matter on you and...

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:57.220
 Yeah, if you could put me down for an early shift, please slash that would be great.

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:58.220
 So many caveats.

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.220
 There's an entire thesis of caveats for this.

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:04.220
 But once we've overcome them, this is teemaking for the future.

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:13.220
 Guys, I'm afraid it's not in the idealised realm of physics, but it is an actual fact, so I don't know.

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:16.220
 Okay, so this is about urinating in swimming pools.

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:23.220
 So if a pool is chlorinated and you have a wiener, it creates a chemical called cyanogen chloride.

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:24.220
 Do you know this?

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:27.220
 And it's toxic.

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.220
 It reacts with nitrogen.

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.220
 It's when chlorine reacts with the nitrogen in your urine.

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:36.220
 And it acts basically as tear gas, and cyanogen chloride is classified as an agent of chemical warfare.

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:42.220
 So when you have a pee in the swimming pool, you are technically in breach of the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons.

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:44.220
 You are a war criminal.

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:45.220
 If you are a swimming pool.

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:49.220
 If you don't report it to the OPCW, then yeah.

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:52.220
 That is actually a bit more idealised experiment than mine.

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:54.220
 Well, there is a calculation on this as well.

00:11:54.220 --> 00:12:00.220
 And it was to see whether you could produce enough cyanogen chloride in this same Olympic sized swimming pool

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.220
 that we found that was open on Christmas Day.

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:03.220
 Is that the boiling one?

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:04.220
 Yeah.

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:08.220
 That would cause a fatal amount of cyanogen chloride to be created.

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:11.220
 So this is done by Casey Johnston at Ars Technica.

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:16.220
 And she calculated that what you needed is 2500 parts per billion.

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:18.220
 That's a fatal dose of cyanogen chloride.

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:24.220
 She said what it turned out you would need is a swimming pool that was two parts water to one part chlorine.

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:28.220
 So is anyway completely fatal to swimming before you get it.

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:34.220
 And you also need about 3 million people to have a P in it before they were killed by the chlorine in the pool.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:37.220
 So we can't put it to military use just yet.

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:40.220
 Wheel pattern pools onto the front line.

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:45.220
 No, it does also make a thing called a trichloramine, which is another lung irritant.

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.220
 And it makes a tiny bit of chloroform as well.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:50.220
 Who knew that this must be going on when you had a P in the pool?

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:53.220
 There is a way of making flashes boiling pool work, of course.

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:58.220
 So you have to do just one simple thing to his pool of water and the people without killing them.

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:03.220
 All you have to do is raise the pool up a mere 18 kilometres into the air.

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:07.220
 Well, 18 kilometres in the air, then water will boil at blood temperature.

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:09.220
 That's probably a better solution.

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:12.220
 So which would probably be easier, actually, if you just raised up, it's called the Armstrong limit.

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:16.220
 We've made a breakthrough. I mean, people said this is actually very useful.

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:22.220
 But it has been checked because, of course, when pilots are very high, above 18 kilometres you have to wear a precious suit.

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:24.220
 I don't know how much oxygen you're getting from oxygen mask.

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:27.220
 Because beyond that point, things like your tears and your saliva start to boil.

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:28.220
 Stop boiling.

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:34.220
 There is a recording of an American pilot who said the last thing we remember before blacking out,

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:40.220
 this is going above 18 kilometres without a precious suit, is feeling the sensation of his saliva boiling on his tongue.

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:42.220
 Wow.

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:44.220
 That's going to be unpleasant.

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.220
 Do you know about boiling in space?

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:47.220
 This is very cool.

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:52.220
 So this is a thing which hadn't been done, obviously, for decades, because they have more pressing things to go into the moon.

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:56.220
 But obviously, the further up you go, the lower the boiling point of water.

00:13:56.220 --> 00:14:02.220
 And in the 1990s, they did a series of experiments on boiling on the space shuttle.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:06.220
 And they found out that when you boil a kettle, it has thousands of thousands of bubbles.

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:10.220
 When you boil a liquid in space, it just produces one big bubble.

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:11.220
 No.

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:14.220
 Then it's hovers up all the other bubbles, it swallows up all the others.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.220
 So you just have one massive bubble when your tea is ready.

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:17.220
 That's so great.

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:21.220
 I was listening to a podcast the other day called Smart Enough to Know Better,

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:23.220
 which is an excellent podcast, really interesting.

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:28.220
 And they were actually talking about a guy who tries to break records for blowing the biggest bubbles.

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:36.220
 And he was saying once a bubble goes above five metres in diameter, if you puncture it, it no longer pops, it tears.

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:37.220
 Isn't that cool?

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:40.220
 So if you blow a gigantic soap bubble, it won't pop anywhere.

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:45.220
 In Edinburgh this year, we were after a show called The Amazing Bubble Man. It was a children's show.

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:47.220
 It was unbelievably good.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.220
 We're watching a bit of it through the curtains.

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:51.220
 Did you feel a bit like a let down after it?

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:56.220
 We couldn't follow it, but all his audience were four-year-olds and all our audience were not four-year-olds.

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:57.220
 So it was all right.

00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:00.220
 But oh man, so you know, he fills a bubble with smoke.

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:05.220
 He sort of injects a bubble, hypothetically, and then pumps smoke into it and it floats up.

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:08.220
 And when it pops, it produces this weird cloud of smoke.

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:12.220
 He has a sort that can sort of slice bubbles in two.

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:15.220
 You don't actually need a sort to do that.

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:18.220
 You can get in for a moment as far as difficult to obtain or do the same.

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:19.220
 That's true.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:20.220
 Yeah, it's fascinating.

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:23.220
 He sort of puts bubbles on people.

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:28.220
 You can put bubbles along the arm of a child, for example, because they don't have hair on the arm.

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:31.220
 But for an adult with more hair on the arm, you can't do that because it doesn't quite work.

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:33.220
 So yeah, all sorts of very interesting stuff.

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:34.220
 What about plug for him?

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:35.220
 I know, I know.

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:36.220
 It's about how you can't remember his name.

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:39.220
 He doesn't need it. He's hugely successful.

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:44.220
 It's just well into, I know, his kind of grotesque, but the business about how the best way to kill a lobster.

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:45.220
 Oh yeah.

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:48.220
 And because there's a sharply divided opinion between...

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:49.220
 Lobsters?

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:54.220
 I mean, you put them in cold water and bring it up to the heat gradually.

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:59.220
 And then they sort of go to sleep and then they're inacitized and die without any.

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:03.220
 Or else you plunge them into boiling water and that kills them instantly.

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:06.220
 Or you stab them in the back.

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:09.220
 Or you don't kill them at all, which is the PETA-Peter position.

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:14.220
 If you do the PETA method and don't kill them, they're going to be very feisty on the plate.

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:15.220
 It's no problem.

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:16.220
 They are.

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:21.220
 We do know what happens if you boil a human alive, though, because there's a description of one.

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:22.220
 Oh, really?

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:28.220
 From the reign of Henry VIII, a cook called Richard Rus, who poised the Bishop of Rochester.

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:35.220
 And he got caught and he thought, "It's a joke. I gave him a purgative. It's just a joke. It's funny. Give him a runny tummy."

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:39.220
 But Henry VIII was incensed and actually put an act of attainment around against him.

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:42.220
 So he could be convicted without trial.

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:46.220
 Then persuaded the parliament to make poisoning an act of treason.

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:51.220
 Then, when he thought it couldn't get any worse, decided that the penalty for poisoning would be being boiled alive.

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:55.220
 So poor old Richard Rus, who apparently had just had a bit of a joke with his employer,

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:58.220
 and then being boiled alive.

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:04.220
 And there's someone who was actually watched, said he roared mighty loud and diverse women who were big with child,

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:08.220
 did feel sick at the sight of what they saw, and were carried away half dead.

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:14.220
 And other men and women did not seem frightened by the boiling alive, but would prefer to see the headspin at his work.

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:16.220
 What is in the executioner?

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:17.220
 The executioner.

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:19.220
 There are lots of different views.

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:22.220
 Well, it's as good as having his head cut.

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:25.220
 Did that catch on as a means of execution? Or is he unique?

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:27.220
 No, there were a few others. There were actually a few before.

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:30.220
 It's often said that Henry VIII invented boiling alive.

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:32.220
 They're actually in Scotland, they're a few.

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:39.220
 There was a layered somewhat earlier, who's upset some of his nobles by apparently being too harsh with them.

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:41.220
 And they got together and threw him in a kettle.

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:50.220
 And apparently, then to prove they were all in it together, they all took a glass of the stew that they made by boiling their layered alive and drank it.

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:53.220
 Do you guys know about the world's deepest swimming pool?

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:56.220
 I don't know about the world's deepest swimming pool.

00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:01.220
 There's not actually that much to say about it, except that I like it because it's called The Deep Joy,

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:04.220
 which sounds like a quote from one of Samuel Peep's favorites.

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:08.220
 But I think this is in Belgium, and you can walk through a tunnel at the bottom of it.

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:11.220
 And it's the depth of 9 or 10 double-decker buses, I think.

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:12.220
 That's really cool.

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:16.220
 Here's my question though, but what's the point of having a deep end at all in this swimming pool?

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:19.220
 Why don't you just make it all sort of a normal type?

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:21.220
 That's annoying. You want to dive down.

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:22.220
 Well not much, particularly.

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:25.220
 I mean, you think it's what you want to understand on your hands and have your feet sticking out, don't you?

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:27.220
 You could do that, a shallow end flash.

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:28.220
 A shallow end flash.

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:31.220
 Otherwise, you have to do all the other noobs up the shallow end.

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:35.220
 And you could have the whole pool, people standing upside down.

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:38.220
 Flash has been possibly removed from many public pools.

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:43.220
 No, the only point, if you're going to do a very steep vertical dive.

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:44.220
 Yeah.

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:48.220
 Otherwise, I guess they have to build that into the plans of the pool.

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:51.220
 In case someone misses the sign saying, please do not do a steep vertical dive.

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:56.220
 Because following the advice of Pierce Fletcher, we have made the entire pool a depth of only a meter and 30.

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.220
 Feel free to stand on your hands.

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:02.220
 It makes it really difficult to boil the water, you know, because it's so much more.

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:10.220
 Okay, time for fact number three.

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:12.220
 And that is my fact.

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:17.220
 And this is that, in Wales, the size of your garden used to be determined by how far you could throw.

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:20.220
 And so this is a tradition in Wales that apparently is very well known.

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:24.220
 And I went to the trouble because I don't want to offend anyone of looking up how you pronounce it.

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:28.220
 And it's called te unos, which means one night house.

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:32.220
 And it was this tradition that apparently dates back to the middle ages, according to Welsh folklore,

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:37.220
 which is that if you could build a house within a night and have a fire burning in the hearth

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:41.220
 and smoke coming out of the chimney by the morning, then you own that property.

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:45.220
 And then the rule was that you could stand on your hands.

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:50.220
 The rule was that you could stand on each of the four corners of your house and throw an axe

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:53.220
 and the distance that you threw it marked out the boundaries of your property.

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:54.220
 And that's what you owned.

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:57.220
 And they continued doing this up until the 19th century.

00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:58.220
 It was never legally...

00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:00.220
 I've never found a law.

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:01.220
 It was never a legal thing.

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:02.220
 I think we just did it.

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:04.220
 You get quite a big garden throwing in it.

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:05.220
 Oh, no, no, no.

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:10.220
 I'm hugely relieved I didn't live in pre-19th century Wales because I would have had the smallest garden of all of my neighbours.

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:15.220
 There's an actual example of a house, which is, or in fact there's several, where there's one in particular supposed to be built that way.

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:16.220
 You know about this and there's no doni at this time.

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:17.220
 There's no doni at this time.

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:20.220
 Yes, this is where, because I went on holiday, the ugly house.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:24.220
 Yeah, I was in Wales last week, so saw it and found out about this thing in an old book.

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:29.220
 But yeah, there is this house in Snowdonia called the ugly house, which is actually really attractive now.

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:34.220
 In a sort of tumble-downy sort of way, but it looks like something out of Hansel and Gressel or something.

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:38.220
 And I think that was made by two brothers in the 15th century.

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:39.220
 Was it? Was that the legend?

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:42.220
 Well, that's the legend, but apparently they think it's more likely to be in 19th century cottage.

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.220
 Yeah, that's more likely to be.

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:48.220
 The other thing is Hill, which is the word they translate as ugly, really doesn't mean ugly in Welsh.

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:49.220
 It means rugged.

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:50.220
 Oh, really?

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:51.220
 Much nicer.

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:52.220
 It does look rugged.

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:53.220
 Yeah.

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:59.220
 Well, a load of the houses that tea in us houses were obviously not very good because they'd been built in a night.

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:01.220
 So a load of them were torn down.

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:05.220
 But then they were replaced later on by more modern cottages on the same site.

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:09.220
 They'd just nip into your garden, build a shade overnight, light a fire in it, throw me acts,

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:11.220
 and you wake up in the morning to find that I own half your garden.

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:12.220
 Yeah.

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:14.220
 And then later I build a very nice house on that.

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:18.220
 A nice conservatory on the side, and then there's a swimming pool in place of my house when I've gone out.

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:19.220
 Yeah, but it happened.

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:21.220
 I'd welcome you, Justin.

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:27.220
 I was just going to say you see, it might not be a law, but you can see how it's the kind of thing that people would believe.

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:29.220
 Or at least they'll talk about it in the pub.

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:31.220
 Apparently, you know, if you do this.

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:35.220
 And then you can say, well, let's do it, and they go out and they do it, and then we'll have a laugh, and then they see if they can get away with it.

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:37.220
 The pen's been on notices, I suppose, isn't it, really?

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:38.220
 Yeah.

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:45.220
 I mean, there is a law of adverse possession in the UK, which changed in 2012, but still exists, whereby if it's called squatters relics,

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:46.220
 it's a short hand for it.

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:53.220
 And if you own a piece of land and act like the proprietor of it for long enough, then it can become your land.

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:55.220
 Do you have to be in it for seven years or something?

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:56.220
 Twelve years.

00:21:56.220 --> 00:22:03.220
 Well, you can't now go and score in someone else's house if it's their home, and then wait for the process, you know, have them appeal to the courts.

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:05.220
 You can immediately be chucked out for that now.

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:05.220
 That's good.

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:11.220
 You could even create your own private beach, because you know, most of the foreland in Britain is owned by the crown.

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:17.220
 That's the bin between sort of midway between the neat and the spring high tide mark and the ocean is owned by the crown.

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:21.220
 But if you wanted your own beach, there were just a couple of simple things you have to do.

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:28.220
 You have to find a nice, quiet beach somewhere, put up a sign saying private keep out, as you often see on beaches, actually, even though they're not.

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:33.220
 You could put up a little fence, don't have to, but it's nice to put up a little fence, just show that you're carrying for the land.

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:40.220
 Roll up your trousers, take your socks off, go for a paddle, and all you have to do is stay there for 60 years, and the beach is yours.

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:41.220
 60 years!

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:43.220
 60 years of paddling, and the beach is yours.

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:47.220
 You didn't know how many Olympic swimming pools you could boil in that time.

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:50.220
 You don't actually have to be literally on the beach all that time.

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:57.220
 And I do wonder if those people who put up private beach signs are actually waiting for 60 years to then say they now own the foreshore.

00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:00.220
 I wouldn't have the nows to do this before the age of, let's say, 20.

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:03.220
 So by the age of 80, you'll have a beach.

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:05.220
 It's a gift for the crown, isn't it?

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:09.220
 It's like planting trees, you know, stealing a foreshore.

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:12.220
 So this thing about throwing a thing and seeing how far it lands.

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:18.220
 I looked into it, and I found a book called The History of the Germanic Empire Volume 3, which was published in 1835.

00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:19.220
 Best volume?

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:21.220
 It's an absolute cracker.

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:23.220
 And it describes a load of these customs.

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:32.220
 So a shepherd could see how far he could drive his flock into someone else's forest by throwing his crook as far as he could.

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:35.220
 Or wherever it lands, you can drive your sheep in that far.

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:39.220
 Or a woodcutter could cut wood according to how far he could throw his axe.

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:40.220
 Could you only throw it once or...?

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:41.220
 I don't know.

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:45.220
 The history of The Germanic Empire Volume 3 is pretty sketchy on details.

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:54.220
 But I just found this other custom which I thought I had to share with you, which is if you kill someone else's dog to make restitution to them,

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:58.220
 what you had to do is hang it up by the tail with its nose just touching the ground.

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:00.220
 And then you had to cover it with wheat.

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:01.220
 So it was completely invisible.

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:03.220
 So you completely covered the whole dog with wheat.

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:08.220
 And then that heap of wheat is the compensation that's due to the person whose dog who kills.

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:12.220
 Heap of wheat covered in dog cock is so precious.

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:14.220
 If it's a toy dog, then you're fine.

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:17.220
 That's just a small loaf of bread you shove it into in your sausage.

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:22.220
 The thing about throwing the axe, the way they found out how much your territorial waters were internationally,

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:25.220
 were how far you could fire a cannon back in the day.

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:29.220
 In fact, not even know that long ago under international law.

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:35.220
 Until the mid-20th century, territorial waters were decided it were three nautical miles, which was the length of the cannon.

00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:36.220
 No!

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:39.220
 And the idea was that that was the distance that you could dominate the sea.

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:40.220
 Defensible distance.

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:42.220
 Wait, you could fire a cannon three miles.

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:43.220
 Three nautical miles.

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:45.220
 Of course you could fire a six-kilometre.

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:47.220
 Spain claimed six nautical miles, but that was unusual.

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:52.220
 And the United Kingdom only extended from three miles to twelve in 1987.

00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:55.220
 I really thought when we suddenly got a cannon upgrade.

00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:56.220
 Got a bigger gun.

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:59.220
 Yeah, these days you've got cruise missiles, which can go quite a long way.

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:00.220
 So you could make a pretty good claim.

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:02.220
 So I think that doesn't work anymore.

00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:03.220
 That's how it worked out.

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:04.220
 Wow, that's interesting.

00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:05.220
 So it's actually such a...

00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:11.220
 And you'd presumably, these Welsh guys were saying, "Well, I can defend this house as far as I can throw this axe."

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:14.220
 But then you have to go out and get the axe from a limitless approach.

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:16.220
 You're still a big deal in North Wales.

00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:17.220
 Is it?

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:18.220
 Yeah, apparently.

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:19.220
 In fact, here's the interesting thing.

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:24.220
 At this moment, there is a thing that's taking place, which is called the Good Life Experience.

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:25.220
 And Howard and the State of North Wales.

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:30.220
 And Karris Matthews runs an annual axe throwing competition there.

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:31.220
 I know who that is.

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:32.220
 Yeah, she said.

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:34.220
 You know, Karris Matthews.

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:38.220
 Karris Matthews and some other people, but she's the one I'd heard of.

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:39.220
 So it's Karris Matthews.

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:40.220
 Yes, that is.

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:42.220
 Well, it's becoming a trend here.

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:46.220
 And James Harkin, formerly of this podcast, has done axe throwing with his wife, Felina,

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:48.220
 and said it was the best one he's ever had.

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:49.220
 I think there's one in Sheditch.

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:51.220
 The best for e-lives are quite nice.

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:53.220
 Well, we should read peeps.

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:59.220
 But they are still, apparently, people still use Tomahorks in a military sense.

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:00.220
 This is true.

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:01.220
 This is true.

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:08.220
 I think in the Korean War, people actually brought throwing axes as part of their gear.

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:10.220
 The Americans brought throwing axes.

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:14.220
 Here's the thing about Tomahorks, which I did not know, is that loads of Native American Tomahorks

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:18.220
 had hollow handles and could be used to smoke through.

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:22.220
 And basically, if some Native Americans met some white settlers,

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:24.220
 it could go one of two ways.

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:28.220
 You use the axe either to hit them or you sort of, you come to some sort of agreement

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:30.220
 and then you smoke together to seal the deal.

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:31.220
 That's amazing.

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:35.220
 In the film, you see the shadow of this shape and be holding it up

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:37.220
 and then you cut and he's a piece fight.

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:39.220
 That's a guy.

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:41.220
 That would work.

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:45.220
 This is so random, but I discovered, since we're talking about America and Wales,

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:48.220
 that the first Welsh settler in America was called Howell Power.

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:49.220
 Howell Power.

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:50.220
 I like that.

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:54.220
 But anyway, I was actually going to talk about squatting in America generally.

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:57.220
 In 2004, a woman in Georgia came over from a holiday.

00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:59.220
 And there was a car in her drive.

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:01.220
 And all the lights were right in her house.

00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:03.220
 And so she went into her house.

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:07.220
 There was a stranger in there, a woman, who was wearing all this woman's clothes.

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:10.220
 She changed all her utility bills into her name.

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:14.220
 She'd installed her washing machine and she'd installed a dryer and she'd moved her dog in.

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:17.220
 And this woman had just moved in, pretended to be her.

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:19.220
 So the lady arrived home, said, get out of my house.

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:21.220
 And we have no idea why she did that.

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:24.220
 She'd ripped out a carpet. She didn't like how one room was painted.

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:25.220
 So she re-painted it.

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:26.220
 What happened?

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:27.220
 She went to prison.

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:28.220
 The which one did?

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:30.220
 The right moment.

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:33.220
 I mean, that's a film, isn't it?

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:34.220
 Who's house is it?

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:36.220
 This lunatic turned up claiming to be me and it was my house.

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:40.220
 That's a good teleformat is who actually owns the house.

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:44.220
 And you get the two claimants and you have to ask them questions about where are the switches?

00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:47.220
 If a light goes the trip switches, you know?

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:49.220
 Squatting through the keyhole.

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:51.220
 Who would squat in a house like this?

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:52.220
 Yeah!

00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:01.220
 Okay, we should move on to our final fact and that is from Andy.

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:06.220
 My fact is that some caterpillars find new friends by drumming on their anuses.

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:07.220
 Work on me?

00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:08.220
 Yeah.

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:12.220
 So this actually, this fact was sent in by somebody by Gourish Chawler.

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:14.220
 So thank you very much for sending us in.

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:15.220
 I liked it so much.

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:18.220
 This is the masked birch caterpillar.

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:21.220
 And it lives on birch leaves and it spins cocoons out of silk.

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:27.220
 But sometimes they need a lot of caterpillars to join in the silk cocoon ceremony

00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:28.220
 and maintain their hiding place.

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:30.220
 So what they do is they do anal drumming.

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:32.220
 So they bang their anuses on the ground.

00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:33.220
 They drum their anus on the leaf.

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:35.220
 And it summons the other caterpillars.

00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:40.220
 But they're very versatile because also if they have rivals and they want to scare a rival away sometimes,

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:43.220
 then they will do anal scraping.

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:44.220
 That's different from anal drumming.

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:45.220
 Oh, yeah.

00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:47.220
 As we all know.

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:50.220
 So they have a thing called an anal awe.

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:51.220
 And they...

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:52.220
 Law what?

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:57.220
 Not a choice I want to be presented with.

00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:00.220
 If you don't have a very strong musical ear as a caterpillar

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:04.220
 and you misinterpret the come hither for the trouble please,

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:06.220
 then yeah, you're really in trouble.

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:07.220
 Yeah.

00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:10.220
 Well, the thing is that there's a recording of this thing online.

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:11.220
 You found that.

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:14.220
 But there's the woman who researches it says you can't really hear it.

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:17.220
 But if you get a laser vibrometer, you hear this crazy rumbling sound.

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:19.220
 They actually sound like lions.

00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:20.220
 Really tiny lions.

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:22.220
 She's called Jane Yak, this researcher.

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:25.220
 And she says they talk to themselves with their asses as well.

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:27.220
 Talking with their butts even when they were alone.

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:30.220
 When feeding they go chomp, chomp, chomp, anal scrape.

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:32.220
 Chomp, chomp, chomp.

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:34.220
 Nothing unusual about that.

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:37.220
 I don't get invited to many dinner parties.

00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:41.220
 The Alcon Blue caterpillar also makes a scraping noise.

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:43.220
 But not for other caterpillars.

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:48.220
 It makes a scraping noise that red ants mistake for a queen red ant.

00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:51.220
 And it releases a sort of a chemical that smells like them as well.

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:54.220
 So the red ants then take the caterpillar into their ant hill.

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:57.220
 Kick out the actual queen ant.

00:29:57.220 --> 00:30:01.220
 The caterpillar sits there eating the larvae to which the ants don't seem at all bothered.

00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:04.220
 Because it smells like a queen, it looks like it doesn't look like it.

00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:06.220
 But it smells like a queen, it's making a queen you sort of noise.

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:10.220
 Right up until the moment when it pupates and it stays in there protected by the ants,

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:11.220
 then it bursts out.

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:14.220
 At which point all the ants go wait a minute.

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:17.220
 There's a butterfly in the middle of the ant hill, which is unusual.

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:20.220
 But they're covered in really loose scales when they come out.

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:23.220
 So the ants make a grab for it and all the scales just come off.

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:25.220
 And it just climbs out and flies away.

00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:26.220
 Brilliant, that's amazing.

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:27.220
 Brilliant.

00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:29.220
 Is our own queen actually the queen?

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:31.220
 Or is she just an enormous caterpillar?

00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:33.220
 Imagine if one year for the state opening of Parliament,

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:36.220
 she comes out and she seems to be covered in these loose scales.

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:37.220
 Oh, what's going on there?

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:39.220
 Oh they floor to be a crab.

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:42.220
 Do you know they have carnivorous caterpillars in Hawaii?

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:43.220
 What are they?

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:44.220
 Beef.

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:45.220
 They eat snails.

00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:48.220
 They trap the snail in the silken noose and then they eat it alive

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:53.220
 because the snail can't move and the caterpillar sort of goes into the hole,

00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:55.220
 the front door, as it were.

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:58.220
 And the snail tries to withdraw further and further into its own shell.

00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:01.220
 Then it runs out of space and then gets eaten alive and eat the whole thing.

00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:03.220
 That's a rough way to go, packed into a corner.

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:05.220
 They should have covered this.

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:07.220
 He's called Daniel Rubinoff.

00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:09.220
 He said almost all insects are predators.

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:12.220
 But to find a caterpillar going after snails are real shocked,

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:15.220
 it's like finding a wolf diving for clams.

00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:19.220
 Well, we'll have to take his word with that, I suppose, because he's the expert.

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:20.220
 That would be a shock.

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:21.220
 I would be a man.

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:24.220
 If I was a snail, I would have a trap door in the back of my shell.

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:25.220
 Or a panic room.

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:26.220
 Which, yes.

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:27.220
 Marine shells do.

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:28.220
 They have an apurculum.

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:31.220
 They have a little trap door they can close up their shell.

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:33.220
 Speaking of the words, "back door."

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:37.220
 Oh, no, I have a fact about, because the fact is about anal drumming.

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:41.220
 I have a fact about the giant California sea cucumber.

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:47.220
 It's a lovely organism, lives in the ocean, and it uses its anus as a mouth,

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:50.220
 in spite of already having a mouth.

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:52.220
 Or does it use its mouth?

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:54.220
 It uses its mouth as a mouth.

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:55.220
 It's very greedy.

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:59.220
 But then when there's food around, it's sort of like, "Oh, I haven't been in half a bit of my bum."

00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:04.220
 That's the series of tubes which go up from its bottom,

00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:07.220
 and it gets water in through those tubes, and it sucks the oxygen out of the water.

00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:09.220
 That's how it gets its oxygen.

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:13.220
 But it also has these blood vessels, and they found that food has been making its way

00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:15.220
 through these blood vessels from the bottom.

00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:17.220
 So that's how they're food.

00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:18.220
 Brilliant.

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:21.220
 On anuses, actually, I was reading about scorpions anuses,

00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:28.220
 and scorpions sometimes lose their anuses in, you know, some creatures do auto-totomy.

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:29.220
 Yes.

00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:33.220
 But the problem with scorpions, these particular scorpions, is that they commit auto-tomy.

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:37.220
 So if you threaten them from behind, then they drop their tail off.

00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:39.220
 But their anuses at the end of their tail.

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:43.220
 So once they've done that, they can no longer defecate.

00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:44.220
 Or sting.

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:45.220
 Or sting, indeed.

00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:48.220
 So they just wave around randomly a little butt.

00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:52.220
 In fact, the guy who discovered this, a guy called Matoni, said that once it had lost its tail,

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:56.220
 he could see the build-up of fecal matter in the back of it.

00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:58.220
 I've got a photograph of it, haven't I?

00:32:58.220 --> 00:32:59.220
 Yeah.

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:00.220
 And they can't grow it back.

00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:01.220
 They can't grow it back.

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:08.220
 The thing is, they can breed in the before they die, you know what I mean?

00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:10.220
 They can bring up a family and pay the school fees.

00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:11.220
 So there's no problem?

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:12.220
 It's not a good chat up line though.

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:14.220
 It's not a good chat up line though.

00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:16.220
 It's like losing your hair.

00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:19.220
 You can still breed before you die.

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:20.220
 Yeah.

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:21.220
 In principle.

00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:25.220
 There is a tiny species of jaw worm, which doesn't have a common name.

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:28.220
 It's called haplornatia, which has a transient anus.

00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:30.220
 For most of the time, it doesn't have a bottom.

00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:34.220
 And it eats things, and when it needs a bottom, a bottom appears for a while.

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:38.220
 It uses the bottom, and then the bottom goes away again.

00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:39.220
 That's so useful.

00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:40.220
 Yeah, transient anus.

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:42.220
 Think how useful that would be.

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:44.220
 I can imagine supermodels wanting to invest in that sort of thing,

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:48.220
 because an anus isn't actually that appealing body part.

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:50.220
 I know they say a lot of things would be a good name for a band,

00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:54.220
 but transient anus would be a fantastic name for a band.

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:55.220
 Matoni worms.

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:59.220
 Do you know the larvae of the emperum off?

00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:01.220
 It's said in the thing I read commonly eaten in Africa,

00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:04.220
 but the Africa is always used to mean just this like a brew.

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:08.220
 And you eat it by squeezing it like a tube of toothpaste,

00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:10.220
 and then giving a quick flick of the wrist

00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:13.220
 to expel the slimy green contents of the gut.

00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:15.220
 And it's a nutritious snack.

00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:18.220
 And there's a bloke who was caught at Gatwick,

00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:21.220
 with four sacks of these things,

00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:23.220
 which confiscated and destroyed.

00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:26.220
 And the customs said they were worth £40,000.

00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:27.220
 What?

00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:29.220
 I know, but I looked up the cost,

00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:32.220
 and you could buy £40,000 in for £16.99 online,

00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:34.220
 which means that if it really was £40,000 worth,

00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:36.220
 this is in 2013.

00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:39.220
 He must have been carrying the same weight as a baby elephant.

00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:40.220
 I saw that.

00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:42.220
 I think it was about 100 kilos.

00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:45.220
 And he claimed that they were for personal consumption.

00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:46.220
 Exactly that.

00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:50.220
 How was he getting that much into the luggage?

00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:53.220
 He just packed your backpack really densely.

00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:54.220
 You could get away with a lot of them.

00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:57.220
 You cannot squeeze that into one of those tiny little wire containers

00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:59.220
 that they easy to check in.

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:00.220
 Well, he didn't...

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:02.220
 I don't know if it may not have been hand luggage.

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:03.220
 This was an unusual seizure,

00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:06.220
 but the vigilance of our officers has stopped these dried inscriptions

00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:08.220
 from entering the UK.

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:09.220
 Right.

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:11.220
 And possibly posing a risk to our food chain.

00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:13.220
 A bit of a tingrid smith.

00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:15.220
 That's the smoke smith for the UK Board Regency talk.

00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:17.220
 I love the idea that you need vigilance to spot

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:20.220
 100 kilos of dried caterpillars in sacks.

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:28.220
 Okay, that's all of our facts today.

00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:30.220
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us here,

00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:32.220
 you can get in touch with the others on Twitter.

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:34.220
 And he's on...
