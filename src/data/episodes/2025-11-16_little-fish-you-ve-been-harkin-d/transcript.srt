 [telephone ringing]

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:03,300
 Hey don't look at it.

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,500
 I don't want to look at it.

4
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,400
 [telephone ringing]

5
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,400
 Hey don't look at it.

6
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,100
 [music playing]

7
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:16,600
 Hello and welcome to an episode of Little Fish.

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,900
 Your new weekly audience fact special of no such thing as a fish.

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,800
 This is the sibling show.

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,400
 This is Big Brother's Little Brother.

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,300
 This is Bake Off An Extra Slice.

12
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,900
 Bake Off An Extra Slice.

13
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,300
 Tracers Uncloked.

14
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,100
 God you know a lot of this.

15
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,300
 Well I work in television.

16
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,500
 I have to know this stuff.

17
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,900
 Antiques Roadshow.

18
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:36,900
 The cheap shit.

19
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,100
 [laughter]

20
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,800
 So we've got some audience facts that have been sent in by a range of listeners.

21
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,100
 They're all brilliant.

22
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,100
 Let's get into it.

23
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,800
 Does anyone have a fact they'd like to kick off with?

24
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,500
 I can do one.

25
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,100
 Yeah, go on.

26
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,300
 All right, this comes in from Kyla Jemisin.

27
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,200
 And the fact is that the P tank on the International Space Station

28
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,000
 has a blue sky account to update everyone on how full it is.

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,300
 So what do you say a P tank?

30
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,700
 Yeah, tank of we?

31
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,200
 Yeah, so there's a toilet on the ISS, there's a few toilets on the ISS.

32
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,200
 One in particular.

33
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,200
 You don't want to be called short.

34
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,200
 Yeah.

35
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,000
 And they have been.

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 They have been.

37
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,400
 Oh yeah, they've had some international problems as well.

38
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,800
 When stuff on the ground is going wrong and let's say one toilet is clogged,

39
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,500
 maybe the Americans won't allow the Russians to use their toilet or vice versa.

40
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,000
 They've had this, but there's a lot of problems.

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 But they do have a tank that collects a urine.

42
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,200
 Yeah, the urine then gets turned into drinkable water.

43
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,800
 So it's reused and so on.

44
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,200
 And this is not an official account.

45
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,000
 It's very explicit that it's not affiliated with NASA.

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 But there is an account on Blue Sky called the ISS PistTracker.

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,600
 And it's because the data of how full the tanks are are available to the public.

48
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,200
 And so and like it updates all the time.

49
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,800
 So how full is the how full is the P tank right now right now?

50
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,100
 Should we have a game?

51
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:53,800
 Yeah, okay.

52
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,800
 Is it sentage?

53
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,800
 Yeah, it's presented.

54
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,800
 Okay, I'm going to say 37%.

55
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,800
 You're saying 37%.

56
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,800
 I've got 38%.

57
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,800
 I'll just play the averages.

58
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,800
 Okay.

59
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,800
 I'm sorry.

60
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,800
 I'll change it.

61
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,800
 37.1%.

62
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,800
 Unbelievable.

63
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,800
 Okay, you sure?

64
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,800
 All right.

65
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:16,800
 As of six minutes ago, the last update, it was 38% full.

66
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,800
 You're joking.

67
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,800
 No.

68
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,800
 I said that.

69
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,800
 Yeah, you did.

70
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,800
 You pulled back to 37.1.

71
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,800
 So you're still ahead.

72
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,800
 Yeah, but you can only accept my first answer.

73
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,800
 And the thing is, it's like, I knew I just I had a feeling it was 38.

74
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,800
 And when Andy said 37, I thought, oh gosh, he's going to get really close.

75
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,800
 But I know it's 38.

76
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,800
 So I'm just going to go for 38.

77
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,800
 Because you thought I went for 38 because it's one more than 37.

78
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,800
 But that no, I had an in-clink.

79
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,800
 And when you said just play the averages, that was just, that was just your code for I know it.

80
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,800
 I just know it.

81
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,800
 If you serious James got it bang on.

82
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,800
 He got it bang on.

83
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,800
 So if we done it 22 minutes ago, it was 36% full.

84
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,800
 And you would have got it.

85
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,800
 You would have got it.

86
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,800
 But yes.

87
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,800
 So I've got to start these shows on time.

88
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,800
 I'm sorry.

89
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,800
 Really annoyed.

90
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:07,800
 I was looking into just urine in space and how it works in the international space station and general shuttles and so on.

91
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:14,800
 And there was a mission in 1984 where something went wrong with the exit point of where the urine gets let out into space.

92
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,800
 It froze up at the end.

93
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,800
 There was a giant icicle.

94
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,800
 And they were really worried because they thought that if it loosens up, it might crack the heat shields as we're going back down.

95
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,800
 They almost did a spacewalk to sort of chisel it off.

96
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,800
 But in the end, they had a robot arm that came and knocked it off and knocked it away.

97
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,800
 Wow.

98
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,800
 It also meant that once they'd got rid of it, the toilet was now out of order.

99
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:40,800
 So for six days, they had to pee into plastic bags.

100
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,800
 And also in space, really hard to pee because of the microgravity, right?

101
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,800
 So you've got to be very careful.

102
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,800
 So how do you think you do it?

103
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,800
 You've got the bag.

104
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,800
 Back for life.

105
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,800
 It's going to be because the other flims you want to have small holes in the bottom, don't they?

106
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,800
 No use.

107
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:59,800
 I assume these are more like what you'd put your sandwich in rather than I don't put your sandwich in there.

108
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,800
 I don't think Sainsbury's bags made it to the ISS or challenge it.

109
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,800
 Do you get in the bag?

110
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,800
 Have the pee.

111
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,800
 How would that help?

112
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,800
 Because none of the peers get in the bag.

113
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,800
 Someone holds it close.

114
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,800
 Do you have your wee quickly?

115
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,800
 Then you just get out of the bag.

116
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,800
 It doesn't make sense.

117
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,800
 Put the bag on the penis.

118
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,800
 This is for men.

119
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,800
 A couple of crocodile clips.

120
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,800
 Hold it in place.

121
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,800
 Very nice idea.

122
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,800
 Now we're thinking like astronauts.

123
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,800
 Now we are.

124
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,800
 Astronauts that did not make the cut.

125
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:37,800
 No, what you would do is you would put socks in and you would put underwear in so that the liquid would instantly soak into something.

126
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
 So they were losing their socks.

127
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,800
 They were losing all of the clothing for six days while they were up there.

128
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,800
 But they made it back safe.

129
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,800
 So all good.

130
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,800
 Right.

131
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,800
 Here's one from Lauren Kramer.

132
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:56,800
 And Spicer being completely landlocked and because of its man-made lakes and reservoirs, Oklahoma has more shoreline than the eastern west coast of the contiguous states combined.

133
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,800
 It also has an international part because the river connects to the Mississippi.

134
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,800
 Wait, Oklahoma has more shoreline than the eastern west coasts of America.

135
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,800
 That's what they're saying.

136
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,800
 But isn't Oklahoma part of the contiguous?

137
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,800
 Yes, but they don't have a Pacific or Atlantic coastline.

138
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,800
 So saying that the shoreline in Oklahoma is more than the Pacific and the Atlantic combined.

139
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,800
 What?

140
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
 Wow.

141
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,800
 How can that be?

142
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,800
 Have you run the math?

143
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:35,800
 Well, I've looked into it and I think probably it's not true, unfortunately, because if you just take Alaska, the shoreline of Alaska is 33904 miles.

144
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:44,800
 And according to the official Bureau, Oklahoma has 55,646 miles of shoreline on its lakes.

145
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:54,800
 So if Alaska is like 60% of the total, probably once you add the east seaboard and western seaboard, then you're going to go above it.

146
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,800
 So I think it's probably not true, but it was difficult for me to find the exact figures.

147
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,800
 Wait, did you say Oklahoma on its lakes?

148
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,800
 And it's like, so basically Oklahoma has a ton of lakes.

149
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,800
 And so they count a shoreline, all the shores of the lakes.

150
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:15,800
 And it's like this thing that, you know, if you're a sooner state person, like you would just know that as a fact you're told as a kid.

151
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,800
 I think probably it's not quite true.

152
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:25,800
 Lauren also said that at high school she learned that Oklahoma has the world's largest salt flats, alabaster deposit and parakeet farm.

153
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,800
 The largest salt flats is in Bolivia, the largest chips and deposits are in Spain.

154
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,800
 And the parakeet farm closed in the 1950s after a fire.

155
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,800
 So I'm sorry Lauren.

156
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:43,800
 Oh, Lauren, you've experienced a writer passage for anyone involved in QI on those things, which is called a thorough harkening.

157
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,800
 And it's like, it's never a nice experience, but you do come out of it a wiser person.

158
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,800
 Yeah, I'm sorry, it's not Lauren's fault. She was told this at school.

159
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,800
 James, that is, I know, but that is a thorough, that's a thorough job.

160
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,800
 Because now Lauren, you get to watch when James dishes out of harkening to the next person.

161
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,800
 And you can be like, yeah, it's a club.

162
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,800
 Every other human being is in that club.

163
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,800
 Who's farming parakeets?

164
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,800
 It was one person. It was one guy in Warrika.

165
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,800
 Now I might have mispronounced that.

166
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,800
 So Lauren might write in and say I've mispronounced it.

167
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,800
 But they brought in just a few parakeets from abroad.

168
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,800
 And then parakeets have like four or five babies every year.

169
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,800
 And so by the 1950s, they had about 1500 breeding pairs.

170
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,800
 Wow.

171
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,800
 But then there was a fire and they never quite reached the former glory.

172
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,800
 And now if you go on the internet and you google Oklahoma parakeets,

173
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,800
 you see Oklahoma was once the parakeet cups of the world and no one knows why.

174
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,800
 Well, that's why we know.

175
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,800
 I've got one, which I think is true from Tracy Thickston,

176
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:48,800
 a common British job used to be operating a shake willy machine.

177
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,800
 That's in the ISS. What's we finished?

178
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,800
 Take off the crocodile clips. Shake your willy.

179
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,800
 Get out of that bag.

180
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,800
 This is so good.

181
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,800
 So you know the word shoddy.

182
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,800
 Dodgy.

183
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,800
 Shoddy is dodgy.

184
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,800
 Low quality.

185
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,800
 It was like a kind of old cloth or something.

186
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,800
 Shoddy, wasn't it?

187
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,800
 That's what it's about.

188
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,800
 So I don't know if it's a whether it's traveled outside the UK.

189
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,800
 I don't know if it's in America, Australia's house.

190
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,800
 A bit of a shoddy job, isn't it?

191
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,800
 No, yeah, yeah.

192
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,800
 So shoddy.

193
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,800
 Okay.

194
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,800
 Well, it was this cloth.

195
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,800
 And it was a mix of ground up rags and virgin wool.

196
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,800
 And it was then woven into new cloth.

197
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,800
 And some of the makers started upping the amount of recycled material.

198
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,800
 And that led to like low quality cloth.

199
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,800
 Because the new stuff was getting more expensive.

200
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,800
 So the word gained the meaning shoddy, low quality.

201
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,800
 Shoddy just used to mean, oh, this is shoddy.

202
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,800
 You know, just, oh, what a nice piece of shoddy cloth.

203
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,800
 Great.

204
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,800
 Anyway, one of the steps of making the shoddy cloths was to do the willy ink in a shake willy machine.

205
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:51,800
 What it meant was roughly cleaning the material to fluff it up and to remove any dirt.

206
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,800
 Do you stop doing that with your hands while you tell us about it?

207
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,800
 And there are these census records of willyers, willy girls, willy men.

208
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,800
 Do we know why it's called willy?

209
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,800
 Is it because they got willy?

210
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,800
 Two theories.

211
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,800
 One is that there were willow baskets involved.

212
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,800
 And one is that it's a derivation of winnowing where you're winnowing out the low quality stuff.

213
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,800
 So you had to feed the willy into the shake willy and that fluffed it up.

214
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,800
 And that got rid of the nips, which is the dust and the dirt.

215
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:22,800
 The second willy ink machine is called the teaser, which is teasing it apart.

216
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,800
 So as far as I can tell, you do the fluffing in the shake willy.

217
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,800
 You get rid of the nips, put it through the teaser and then finally add the lubricant.

218
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,800
 That's the process.

219
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,800
 The Kenneth Williams, in fact, there's such a job.

220
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,800
 Imagine what's your profession of a willy man.

221
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,800
 That's good.

222
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,800
 I didn't, we were doing this recently with the Rachel Paris episode where we talked about extinct jobs.

223
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,800
 Yeah, I must admit, I had willy ink on my list.

224
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,800
 Oh, yeah.

225
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,800
 But we never got around to it.

226
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,800
 That's surely extinct.

227
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,800
 There's nobody willy ink these days.

228
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,800
 No willy is now.

229
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,800
 No.

230
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,800
 There is a brilliant Yorkshire company called I knew you.

231
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,800
 What?

232
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,800
 Was that your Yorkshire accent?

233
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:03,800
 It's what it's called I knew you, which is an abbreviation of it is not over until it is over.

234
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,800
 It's almost all vows.

235
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,800
 Sorry, what's that stew with willy ink?

236
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,800
 They're recycling firm.

237
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,800
 It's about recycling cloth.

238
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,800
 I got it.

239
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:20,800
 Yeah, and and Shoddy was pioneered in badly in Yorkshire by Benjamin Law, who founded a company called Shoddy Manufacturing, which is lovely.

240
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,800
 Right, who's next?

241
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,800
 I'll go on.

242
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,800
 This was sent into us by Jackie Gamel.

243
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:36,800
 She writes, the reason airplanes have round windows is because old planes used to have square ones, which created weak points, which caused metal fatigue.

244
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:42,800
 And metal fatigue failure would be where the window was weakened further by air pressure at high altitude.

245
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,800
 And supposedly a few crashes were off the back of this.

246
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,800
 And so they now, as we all know, have circular windows.

247
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,800
 And that is to distribute the pressure evenly.

248
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,800
 Yeah, that's a strong, very strong shape, isn't that circle?

249
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,800
 Yeah.

250
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,800
 I think now the materials are strong enough that you can get any shape of window.

251
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,800
 Could you play that was all window?

252
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,800
 Yeah, now you can.

253
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,800
 Wow.

254
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,800
 But people just wouldn't go for it.

255
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,800
 I think I wouldn't either.

256
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,800
 I think I would not go for that.

257
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,800
 I would like to play where you can see into the hold.

258
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
 So you look down and you're like, oh, there's my bag.

259
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,800
 Yeah.

260
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,800
 Yeah, I think that'd be really great.

261
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,800
 Do you think?

262
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,800
 I reckon you don't want to know what goes on in there.

263
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,800
 I imagine some weird shit goes on in those holds.

264
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,800
 Yeah, lots of Willie Shaken down there.

265
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,800
 Well, like snakes on a plane kind of thing.

266
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,800
 Yeah.

267
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,800
 Yeah, I don't want to see snakes down there.

268
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:36,800
 But a novelty glass bottom plane is a very interesting concept.

269
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,800
 Yeah.

270
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:44,800
 Like that is quite interesting to I'm a terrified flyer, but even I think I might do that.

271
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,800
 No.

272
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,800
 Yeah.

273
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,800
 Have you ever been in the glass bottom boat?

274
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,800
 I have.

275
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,800
 That's great fun.

276
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,800
 Thank you.

277
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,800
 Are you going to invent that?

278
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,800
 I'm well done.

279
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,800
 And we should say that event at the last moment.

280
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,800
 And now he's going to do it again with the plane apparently.

281
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,800
 What about an aeroplane?

282
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,800
 You know those rides at theme parks where you're not in a carriage.

283
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,800
 You're sort of suspended by your shoulders.

284
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,800
 Oh, the danglers.

285
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,800
 You're a dangler.

286
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,800
 What about Ryanair?

287
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,800
 Or it's a dangle all the way to Malaga.

288
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,800
 Oh, my goodness.

289
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,800
 So the plane has a top, but no bottom.

290
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,800
 Yeah.

291
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,800
 That's a good idea.

292
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,800
 I'm thinking, you know, it saves a bit of money on fuselage.

293
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,800
 It's going to make serving good drinks very tricky.

294
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,800
 I'll say that.

295
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,800
 I guess the steel is hanging upside down.

296
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,800
 I suppose they could wish themselves along down because there's no bottom on the plane.

297
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,800
 Why are they hanging upside down?

298
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,800
 Why are they not just attached the right way up like you are?

299
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,800
 They're all that players.

300
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,800
 Okay, okay.

301
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,800
 I'm going to row back on that.

302
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,800
 They can be the right way up.

303
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,800
 Now we're talking.

304
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,800
 Remember to not let Andy pitch our weird roller coaster plane.

305
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,800
 It will be stressful when you're coming into Lambo because it'll feel like

306
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,800
 you have to run very, very fast at a certain point to slow the plane down.

307
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,800
 It's a Flintstones plane.

308
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,800
 It's a Flintstones plane.

309
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:06,800
 Mark Loggy writes, in the 1760s Simon Harcott, the first L Harcott demolished the village

310
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,800
 of Noonham Courtney, as well as Noonham House, in order to make room for his garden.

311
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,800
 And he rebuilt the entire village one mile to the northeast.

312
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,800
 Wow.

313
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,800
 To make room for his garden.

314
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,800
 Yeah.

315
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,800
 It feels to me like it's easier to move a garden than it is to demolish the village.

316
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,800
 The thing is about rich people.

317
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,800
 They're not really bothered about what's easiest.

318
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,800
 They're more bothered about what's more convenient for them.

319
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,800
 And what's affordable, like if that's just within your budget?

320
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,800
 I think for Simon Harcott, the first L Harcott, everything was within budgets.

321
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,800
 There you go.

322
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,800
 And did just rebuild it correctly?

323
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,800
 Yeah.

324
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,800
 So if you drive through that area now.

325
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,800
 Yeah.

326
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,800
 So it's like basically from the M4 to the M40 up there.

327
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,800
 You can go through Noonham Courtney.

328
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,800
 And basically all the buildings are almost identical because he had to build them all at the same time

329
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,800
 for the people who removed from that village.

330
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,800
 Wow.

331
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,800
 Well, it's good that he rebuilt it.

332
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,800
 I'll say that.

333
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,800
 You know?

334
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,800
 Yeah.

335
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,800
 I would be a bit annoyed if someone's telling me to move your house from my garden.

336
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,800
 But if it's, if you're putting it back.

337
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,800
 What difference does it make if he removes everyone's, right?

338
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,800
 Yeah, no difference.

339
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,800
 I guess you're going to have a bit of time where the renovations going on is going to be quite inconvenient.

340
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,800
 Yeah, those jobs do stretch on, don't they?

341
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,800
 Especially if the builders would be quite busy because they've got to rebuild everyone's house.

342
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,800
 Yeah.

343
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,800
 What would have been great as if one family happened to have gone away on like a really long trip.

344
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,800
 And everyone decided not to tell them what had happened.

345
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,800
 And there's just go on as normal.

346
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,800
 I swear to God, we were closer to that.

347
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,800
 Am I getting nuts?

348
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,800
 Something else about Noonham Courtney.

349
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,800
 Yeah.

350
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,800
 I was looking into famous residents.

351
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:49,800
 Davis Lever, she was the person who broke the Italian Enigma code, which allowed the Royal Navy to ambush the Italian fleet at the Battle of Matapan, which was quite decisive.

352
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,800
 And she also broke the Abwehr Enigma, which was one of the German Enigmas.

353
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,800
 They had a few different codes that they used.

354
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,800
 Right.

355
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:04,800
 And that one, she solved it with her colleague Margaret Rock, which led to the right saying, give me a lever and rock.

356
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,800
 And I can move the universe, bloody brilliant.

357
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,800
 That's what one of her bosses said.

358
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,800
 That's really good.

359
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,800
 Here's one.

360
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,800
 It's from Jude Caffruini.

361
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:24,800
 This is maybe the most stoner fact in the inbox over the last, you know what I mean?

362
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,800
 Like the sort of woo, like the cause of cosmicly mind-blowing fact.

363
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,800
 Let's hear it.

364
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,800
 The T-Rex is closer to us in time than it is to the Stegosaurus.

365
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,800
 No, I really like this.

366
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,800
 I love dinosaur timing facts.

367
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,800
 Yeah.

368
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:44,800
 And this is that the T-Rex went extinct when they all did about 65, 6 million years ago.

369
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,800
 Right?

370
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,800
 But the T-Rex was actually quite new.

371
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:52,800
 It was only properly arrived in its final form at about 72 million years ago.

372
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,800
 And I got really sad reading that.

373
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,800
 And I thought, no, they had 6 million.

374
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,800
 That's a lot of time.

375
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,800
 That's such a long time.

376
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,800
 I don't know what I got.

377
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,800
 I got a bit misty eye thinking, God, they were in their prime.

378
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,800
 They had so much to give.

379
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,800
 They could have built their own HS2 in that time.

380
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,800
 Exactly.

381
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,800
 Exactly.

382
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:13,800
 But when that happened, when T-Rex arrived, 72 million years ago in the Lake Rotator's,

383
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,800
 Stegosaurus had already been extinct for over 70 million years.

384
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:22,800
 So the Stegosaurus and the T-Rex are further apart than the T-Rex is from us.

385
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:30,800
 Do you know that Sergeant Peppers, the album, is closer to the modern day than it is

386
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,800
 to when Cleopatra was alive?

387
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,800
 No way.

388
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,800
 Woo!

389
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,800
 And that's a stone effect, isn't it?

390
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,800
 [laughter]

391
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,800
 Sounds like an impressive fact until you actually listen to it.

392
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,800
 That's my thing.

393
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,800
 [laughter]

394
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,800
 That was the thing with the name Jurassic Park, that often gets said,

395
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,800
 is that half the dinosaurs in the movie are not Jurassic.

396
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,800
 But it implies that the dinosaurs in the park would have been incredibly freaked out by each other.

397
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,800
 They would have, like, the T-Rex would have been looking at the Stegosaurus.

398
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,800
 What is that?

399
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,800
 Yes.

400
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,800
 Whereas the humans, they would have been relatively calm about, because we're closer in time to them,

401
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,800
 so they'd be like, oh yeah, it's a normal, you know what I mean?

402
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,800
 Yeah, it's an interesting point.

403
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,800
 I don't think so.

404
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,800
 [laughter]

405
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,800
 It's not an interesting point.

406
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,800
 Oh no.

407
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,800
 Oh, I retract mine as well.

408
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,800
 No, you can't retract your point just because it's going with J.

409
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:22,800
 If you look now at an animal that was extinct 55 million years ago,

410
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,800
 and then you see an animal, which hasn't been invented yet,

411
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:31,800
 and will come in 20 million years, even though it's closer to you, which is going to be more surprising.

412
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,800
 Yeah.

413
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,800
 Yeah, okay.

414
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,800
 Yeah, all right.

415
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,800
 I retract.

416
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,800
 Yeah.

417
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,800
 Take that.

418
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,800
 All the way in my point was not interesting.

419
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,800
 You've been harkened.

420
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,800
 [laughter]

421
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,800
 Oh, it's tough.

422
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,800
 It's tough.

423
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,800
 But the T-Rex used to be the size of a Dalmatian.

424
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,800
 When it started.

425
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,800
 Ages ago.

426
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,800
 Yeah, yeah.

427
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,800
 Right.

428
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,800
 I think that's cool.

429
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,800
 Three meters long and 30 kilos.

430
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,800
 Was that a T-Rex or like another Tyrannosaur, like a related Tyrannosaur?

431
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,800
 It was an ancestor.

432
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,800
 It was what eventually turned into the T-Rex.

433
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:05,800
 Because I wonder if a baby T-Rex when it's born is already bigger than that size.

434
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,800
 Three meters is a big egg, isn't it?

435
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,800
 Yeah.

436
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,800
 Oh, that's true.

437
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,800
 Anyway, there you go.

438
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,800
 Here's one.

439
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,800
 This is from Ron Lebach.

440
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:21,800
 And Ron says that Case Western Reserve University, which is home of the famous physics study,

441
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:26,800
 the Michelson-Molly Experiment, which disproved that the ether existed,

442
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,800
 of looking at me like you know what that means.

443
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:34,800
 The theory was that the earth was going through some kind of air or some kind of field,

444
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,800
 but actually it turned out that it's going through space and these guys proved it.

445
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:45,800
 Anyway, this university, they test whether or not Galileo's theorem of gravity is true

446
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:52,800
 every Halloween by dropping two jumbo size pumpkins from the top of the auditorium building.

447
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,800
 And the idea is they could be different weights, but they should land at the same time.

448
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,800
 Right.

449
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,800
 And Spyler Alert, gravity works and they are.

450
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,800
 Good to check every year, though.

451
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,800
 You never know.

452
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,800
 You never know.

453
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,800
 It might change.

454
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,800
 Yeah, I think it is fun.

455
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,800
 Scientists have to check these things.

456
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,800
 And it brought me onto pumpkins.

457
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,800
 I've done a bit of my own research on pumpkins.

458
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:17,800
 There's an old cuifacts that 95% of pumpkins in the UK are not eaten.

459
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:22,800
 Because we basically buy them and turn them into jackalandsons and then throw them away.

460
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,800
 But actually that is not true anymore.

461
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,800
 That fact is really really old.

462
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:31,800
 But there was a 2024 survey that found about 37% of pumpkins are eaten.

463
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,800
 Which is just under the amount of urine currently sitting inside the ISS P tank.

464
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,800
 That's food for thought.

465
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,800
 But it's still not enough.

466
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:45,800
 And there is a campaign run by Hubbub which is a charity for the environment.

467
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:50,800
 And someone called Emily Gusson who wrote something called don't waste your pumpkin.

468
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,800
 To try and get people to eat pumpkins.

469
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,800
 And they have like pumpkin recipes.

470
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,800
 And just what raise awareness of not wasting food.

471
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:04,800
 And they claimed that they've almost halved pumpkin waste in the last year.

472
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,800
 Wow.

473
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,800
 So that's really good work for them.

474
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:12,800
 So if you're listening to this, it's three weeks after Halloween already.

475
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,800
 But don't despair.

476
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,800
 If you've still got a few pumpkins there, just scrape off the mold.

477
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,800
 They might still be good.

478
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,800
 Can I just do one more thing?

479
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,800
 Because I have an extra one that we never got to.

480
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,800
 And I did lots of extra research for it.

481
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:30,800
 So Frederico Santa wrote that if Tom and Jerry was made in ancient Rome,

482
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,800
 Tom instead of being a cat would have been a weasel.

483
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:40,800
 And that's because according to Frederico, the Romans had pet weasels instead of pet cats to get rid of mice and stuff.

484
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,800
 Lovely.

485
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,800
 They found the website called foundinantiquity.com.

486
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,800
 And they have a really, really long explanation of this.

487
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,800
 And they don't think it's true.

488
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,800
 They think that weasels were not used as pets.

489
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,800
 They were in the houses, but they were kind of a pest themselves.

490
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:01,800
 But the reason I wanted to say it is because they found on this website that this theory

491
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:09,800
 was first theorized in 1718 by Magnus Radilius and Andreas E. Weasel.

492
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:17,800
 And they reckon that maybe he came up with this theory that they had pet weasels because his name was Mr Weasel.

493
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,800
 Amazing.

494
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,800
 Amazing.

495
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,800
 Oh, Frederico, you've been harkened.

496
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,800
 That's good, though.

497
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,800
 That's very interesting.

498
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,800
 Yeah, I think the jury's still slightly out.

499
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,800
 Because they're in the house. I mean, that's a big animal to have a new house as a pest.

500
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,800
 Yeah, but a lot of the sources when they talk about these weasels,

501
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,800
 they talk about them in the same as you would say there is a fly in the house.

502
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:45,800
 Or there's a mouse in the house or a rat in the house is like an annoying thing.

503
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,800
 Right.

504
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,800
 Are they basically like ferrets?

505
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,800
 Well, they are smaller than ferrets.

506
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,800
 And the other thing is ferrets actually are quite easy to tame.

507
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:58,800
 And like I have a friend said, who I don't know if he still has a pet ferret, but he definitely used to.

508
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,800
 Then John Mitchinson from QI used to have a pet ferret.

509
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,800
 Oh, that's right.

510
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,800
 Yeah.

511
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,800
 But I think weasel, they're just a little bit angry and I think they don't make good pets.

512
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,800
 Do we get them in the UK?

513
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,800
 I can't actually.

514
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,800
 Oh, yeah.

515
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,800
 We go weasels.

516
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,800
 Yeah.

517
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,800
 Good fats.

518
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,800
 Old QI fats.

519
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,800
 Most weasels in the UK are least weasels.

520
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,800
 Yeah.

521
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,800
 Because there's a species called the least weasel, which is the most common one in the UK.

522
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,800
 That's lovely.

523
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,800
 I think we have a fact in the inbox someone saying, sorry, I don't remember the correspondent now,

524
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,800
 but the least weasel is currently rated as least concerned.

525
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,800
 Which is nice because the population's kind of doing all right.

526
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,800
 Yeah.

527
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,800
 My, my old neighbor used to take a ferret for a walk on a lead.

528
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,800
 Okay.

529
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,800
 As a pet, which is a cool thing to do.

530
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,800
 I think it's cool.

531
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,800
 Yes.

532
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,800
 Yes.

533
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,800
 You do.

534
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,800
 Okay.

535
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,800
 Okay.

536
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,800
 Okay.

537
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,800
 Let's go to inaugurating the latest members of the friend of the podcast.

538
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,800
 Very big.

539
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,800
 Exciting.

540
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:57,800
 Anyone who has signed up to Clubfish at the friend of the podcast here gets one of our headline

541
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,800
 facts in perpetuity.

542
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:03,800
 You are then the sponsor, patron, whatever you like of that fact, and you get a little shoutout

543
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,800
 on this show.

544
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,800
 That's what we're trying to say here.

545
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,800
 So we should, we should do some shoutouts.

546
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,800
 Guys, we've had a bit of a rush on membership of friend of the podcast.

547
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,800
 So we are going to up the pace.

548
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:17,800
 And of the number of shoutouts we give a show and and and get through a few more.

549
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,800
 So we're sorry we may not get to some of you for a little while, but your names are in the

550
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,800
 system.

551
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,800
 And we're going to try really hard to get through them.

552
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,800
 There's been a swell.

553
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:31,560
 You know those companies when you ring them and they say, sorry, we're having an unexpected

554
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,800
 large number of calls, but they say it absolutely every single day.

555
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,800
 Yeah.

556
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,800
 We're going to have that.

557
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,800
 I'm afraid we've experienced unprecedented demand.

558
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,800
 Yeah.

559
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,800
 And we're going to be dealing with it in a precedented way.

560
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:45,800
 So your fact will be dealt with in around seven months.

561
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,800
 It'll be before then we hope.

562
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,800
 Before then we hope.

563
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,800
 Let's do it.

564
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,800
 Right.

565
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,800
 Let's do some right today.

566
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,800
 Shout out number one goes to Orion Slater.

567
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,800
 Brilliant.

568
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,800
 What a terrific name.

569
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,800
 Orion.

570
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,800
 Three stars.

571
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,800
 Lovely.

572
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,800
 Lovely.

573
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,800
 He.

574
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,800
 Orion must be absolutely sick of that.

575
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,800
 Um, belt up.

576
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,800
 There we go.

577
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,800
 Very good.

578
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:13,800
 Anyway, Orion, your fact is that the earliest known dentistry is 9,000 years old.

579
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,800
 Yes.

580
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,800
 So what's the most exciting thing about this fact?

581
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,800
 Is it's not one of our facts or even one of ours?

582
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,800
 That's right.

583
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,800
 It's Greg Jenner's.

584
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,800
 Historian Greg Jenner.

585
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,800
 And this was our third episode.

586
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,800
 Yeah.

587
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:29,800
 And Greg Jenner and comedian Alex Edelman were sitting there with me in James for this episode.

588
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,800
 So.

589
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,800
 Where was I?

590
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,800
 I think you.

591
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,800
 I think you didn't really care about the show at that point.

592
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,800
 It's sort of a bit loose and goosey.

593
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,800
 And I've maintained that.

594
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,800
 I know.

595
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:43,800
 And you know, stays. Yeah, we did two in one day actually.

596
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,800
 Do you remember?

597
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,800
 And we got Greg and Alex to come in and do a show.

598
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,800
 And then as soon as we finished, as soon as the mics went off, they came back on again.

599
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,800
 And we did a show with the four of us.

600
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,800
 That's right.

601
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,800
 They basically came in to have a cup of tea.

602
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,800
 James and I said one.

603
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,800
 We just make an episode instead while they're here.

604
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,800
 So yeah, well done to Orion Slater.

605
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,800
 Great fact.

606
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,800
 Ancient dentistry.

607
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,800
 Let's have another.

608
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,800
 Okay.

609
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,800
 Well, this one is going to Christine and Tom Asbridge.

610
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:12,800
 And the fact is that according to Dr. Hans Ulrich, the middle ages never happened.

611
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:17,800
 This is a wild theory called Phantom Time Hypothesis.

612
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,800
 Largely put into the show because we knew that Greg would be horrified.

613
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,800
 He was sitting on a show that was discussing this particular thing.

614
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,800
 It just puts that in really.

615
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,800
 Wasn't it?

616
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,800
 Yeah, in a friendly way.

617
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,800
 We did, we did like it.

618
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,800
 But that was the idea.

619
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,800
 Yeah.

620
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:35,800
 And the excited thing about that one is that this is a special medieval fact requested by Christine.

621
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,800
 For Tom, who is a medieval historian and writer.

622
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:44,800
 So we're not going to say you can request your facts if you're a friend of the podcast.

623
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:49,800
 But you can put a little note in, you know, like where you put a allergic to nuts or something.

624
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,800
 Yeah.

625
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:55,800
 But as the guy who does the emails, I'd like to specify that as the chef in this restaurant, I may put nuts in anyway.

626
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,800
 That's absolutely.

627
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:01,800
 Well, while I'm these reply to emails, he may be touching nuts.

628
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,800
 So let's go to the next one.

629
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:13,800
 It was the fact is the most medically indispensable sea creature in the United States is the horse shoe crab.

630
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,800
 And that was an originally a fact from Alex Edelman.

631
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,800
 Lovely.

632
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,800
 A good friend.

633
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,800
 Like he's in the room.

634
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:26,800
 But now it is under the custodian ship of Anna, also known as Anna MC Anna Mac.

635
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:31,800
 She's a regular contributor to various emails and stuff like that.

636
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,800
 Yeah.

637
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,800
 Congratulations Anna.

638
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,800
 Yeah.

639
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,800
 And I like that.

640
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,800
 I do like the fact that the most medically indispensable sea creature in the United States.

641
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,800
 Like it's qualifier city, isn't it?

642
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,800
 Yeah.

643
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,800
 Yeah.

644
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,800
 I think Alex had just read a documentary or watched a documentary about the horseshoe crab.

645
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,800
 Right.

646
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,800
 And just wanted to talk about that.

647
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,800
 I love the idea of reading a documentary.

648
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,800
 It feels like it's something kind of thing you would do, James.

649
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,800
 Well, you print out the transcript of the documentary and then you read it because you'll do it faster

650
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,800
 and it won't be irritating pictures in the way.

651
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,800
 Yeah.

652
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,800
 I have a friend who reads all of our podcasts.

653
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,800
 Doesn't listen to them.

654
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,800
 Reads them.

655
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,800
 Wow.

656
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,800
 Yeah.

657
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,800
 I mean, you read famously.

658
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,800
 You read.

659
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,800
 It's rips of toy stories.

660
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,800
 Oh, far of them.

661
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,800
 Never seen the films.

662
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,800
 Did you cry at the right bits?

663
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,800
 Yeah.

664
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,800
 Just dripped on the printout.

665
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,800
 Couldn't read the next bit.

666
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,800
 Oh, dear.

667
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,800
 Right.

668
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,800
 Let's have another fact.

669
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:25,800
 Is going to double o die names.

670
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,800
 Dynamies.

671
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,800
 It's a terrific name.

672
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:33,800
 And it's that Queen Elizabeth slept in a bedroom with 28 women.

673
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,800
 So congratulations, double o.

674
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,800
 It's the Bonnie blew of her time.

675
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,800
 That's rude.

676
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,800
 Is it?

677
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,800
 I'm going to pretend I don't know who that is.

678
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,800
 Me too.

679
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,800
 Me too.

680
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:50,800
 I think that was the vibe we were going for to try and do a bit of a new end up.

681
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,800
 But actually, this was the fact that she had lots of handmaids and stuff.

682
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,800
 You used to sit and sleep in her bedroom.

683
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,800
 Yeah, they'd watch her give birth as well.

684
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,800
 Queen Elizabeth first.

685
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,800
 Did you have changed history then?

686
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,800
 That's huge.

687
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,800
 Sorry.

688
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:09,800
 I was thinking about the chambermaids who would stay and and births in those periods.

689
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,800
 I've been viewed by huge parties.

690
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,800
 So for Queen Elizabeth first, nicknamed the Virgin Queen.

691
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,800
 I think probably that wouldn't have been a big part of the jobs back.

692
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,800
 Not the nickname of Bonnie blew.

693
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,800
 Okay.

694
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,800
 Well, I don't know who that is.

695
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,800
 That's right.

696
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,800
 Carry on.

697
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,800
 So the next one.

698
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,800
 I'll do this one.

699
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,800
 It's the 30 million Chinese people living caves.

700
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:35,800
 And that fact is now under the custodianship of Nathan Morgan.

701
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,800
 Congratulations, Nathan.

702
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,800
 It feels like a fact that we'll have undergone some depreciation.

703
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,800
 Yeah, I think it was a fact of its time.

704
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,800
 It could have been an appreciation because the population's gone up a long way in the last 11 years.

705
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,800
 Yeah.

706
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,800
 What of China?

707
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,800
 Oh yeah.

708
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,800
 I suppose it has.

709
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,800
 Yeah, definitely.

710
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,800
 I feel like the housing boom in China might have might have.

711
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,800
 There's lots of rural bits of China that there are.

712
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,800
 But increasingly more people live in these mega cities, don't they?

713
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,800
 Yeah.

714
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,800
 Yeah.

715
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,800
 It's interesting that we can now say we've been going so long that we can talk about our own facts

716
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,800
 and say, well, that was a different time.

717
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,800
 Yeah.

718
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,800
 And it's us we're talking about.

719
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,800
 Well, it's weird.

720
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,800
 If you listen back to that episode, you'd probably hear yourself saying stuff where you're going,

721
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,800
 what am I talking about?

722
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,800
 I don't know that.

723
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,800
 When did I say that?

724
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,800
 I mean, that happens with every episode by the last three.

725
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,800
 Yeah.

726
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,800
 Like, I just, I'm just like, who's this guy?

727
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,800
 He sounds handsome.

728
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:24,800
 Are you one of those people always get to be a few mixed up?

729
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,800
 I have.

730
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,800
 Every time I look at the mirror, I'm shocked.

731
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,800
 Not have your face.

732
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,800
 Shall I do one?

733
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,800
 Yeah.

734
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,800
 All right.

735
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,800
 Hello, Alex Teewski.

736
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,800
 You have just become the custodian of this fact from James Harkin.

737
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:43,800
 There is a banker in Latvia who will lend you money using your immortal soul as security.

738
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,800
 That's great.

739
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,800
 Is he still going?

740
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,800
 I'm not sure.

741
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:52,800
 I'll tell you why I did this fact because our first, I think our first ever listener was Gattis

742
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,800
 who is or who was the advertising partner of my wife.

743
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,800
 And I sent him the episode to see what he thought about it.

744
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,800
 And that was before it went online or anything.

745
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,800
 And he is from Latvia.

746
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,800
 So I thought we'd do a little Latvian fact.

747
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,800
 I know.

748
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,800
 That's so cool.

749
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,800
 That is cool.

750
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,800
 Our first listener.

751
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,800
 That's great.

752
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,800
 I think he is.

753
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,800
 Well, that's a great fact.

754
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,800
 I'll do another one.

755
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,800
 This is another Anna.

756
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:22,200
 Anna, your fact forever is that for a hundred years, almost all maps of Africa contained a fictional

757
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,800
 mountain range called the mountains of Kong.

758
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:30,800
 So to clarify, that was a fact that was said by Anna.

759
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,800
 Yes.

760
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:35,800
 But it's now under the custodianship of another Anna.

761
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,800
 Whose surname we don't know.

762
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,800
 She's just Anna.

763
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,800
 Exactly.

764
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,800
 And Anna has signed up to be a friend of the podcast.

765
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,800
 Not a chance.

766
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,800
 No, she doesn't.

767
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,800
 She doesn't listen to the main show, let alone whatever we're doing now.

768
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,800
 She doesn't know this exists.

769
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:54,800
 I spoke to her last week and then she says she has been listening to the episodes and really enjoying them.

770
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,800
 Oh, okay.

771
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,800
 So Anna has been replaced.

772
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,800
 Yeah.

773
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,800
 Motherhood has done a really weird thing to her second time around.

774
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,800
 She did look very tired.

775
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,800
 That's a great fact.

776
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,800
 I think that's a really fun fact in the mountains of Kong.

777
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,800
 It's a huge mountain range.

778
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,800
 Everyone said, well, you can't go that way.

779
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,800
 What about the mountains of Kong?

780
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,800
 And they just weren't there.

781
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,800
 That one feels weirdly like an OG classic of fish.

782
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,800
 Absolutely.

783
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,800
 Here is one more for this week.

784
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:25,800
 So male Pennsylvania grassbiders are much like clear to approach a female who has already killed

785
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,800
 and eaten a male.

786
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,800
 That feels like an Anna fact, doesn't it?

787
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,800
 But actually it was one of yours, Andy.

788
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,800
 But now it is under the custodianship of Alva Klausen.

789
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,800
 Well done, Alva.

790
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,800
 It's a good fact.

791
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:42,800
 Male Pennsylvania grassbiders are much like you to approach a female who has already

792
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,800
 killed and eaten a male.

793
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,800
 Which is crazy, right?

794
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,800
 Because she's got a form.

795
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,800
 But she's full.

796
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,800
 You see what I mean?

797
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,800
 Yes.

798
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,800
 The killer wouldn't possibly want to kill again.

799
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,800
 No, that's what they say about serial killers, isn't it?

800
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,800
 Once you've killed once.

801
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,800
 It's not a told more-ish.

802
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:10,800
 You bump into, oh god, no, no, no, no, don't worry, I already did once tonight.

803
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,800
 Just want to hang.

804
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,800
 Yeah, great.

805
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,800
 Well, there you go.

806
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,800
 That is this week's batch of fact custodians.

807
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,800
 Thank you so much to all of you who've signed up at frankly any tier of club fish.

808
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,800
 It's a joy to have you on board.

809
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,800
 We will be back again in another week's time with another little fish.

810
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,800
 We'll be back in less time than that with another main episode of the show.

811
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,800
 And for members of Club Fish, we'll be back in an indeterminate amount of time

812
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,800
 with a drop as a line our audience feedback show.

813
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,800
 Clear?

814
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,800
 Clear.

815
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,800
 Great.

816
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,800
 Bye.
