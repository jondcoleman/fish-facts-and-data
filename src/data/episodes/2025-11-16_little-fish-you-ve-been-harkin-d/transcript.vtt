 [telephone ringing]

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:03.300
 Hey don't look at it.

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.500
 I don't want to look at it.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.400
 [telephone ringing]

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.400
 Hey don't look at it.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.100
 [music playing]

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.600
 Hello and welcome to an episode of Little Fish.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.900
 Your new weekly audience fact special of no such thing as a fish.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:22.800
 This is the sibling show.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.400
 This is Big Brother's Little Brother.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.300
 This is Bake Off An Extra Slice.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.900
 Bake Off An Extra Slice.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.300
 Tracers Uncloked.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.100
 God you know a lot of this.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.300
 Well I work in television.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.500
 I have to know this stuff.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.900
 Antiques Roadshow.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:36.900
 The cheap shit.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.100
 [laughter]

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.800
 So we've got some audience facts that have been sent in by a range of listeners.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.100
 They're all brilliant.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.100
 Let's get into it.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.800
 Does anyone have a fact they'd like to kick off with?

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.500
 I can do one.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.100
 Yeah, go on.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.300
 All right, this comes in from Kyla Jemisin.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.200
 And the fact is that the P tank on the International Space Station

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.000
 has a blue sky account to update everyone on how full it is.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.300
 So what do you say a P tank?

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.700
 Yeah, tank of we?

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.200
 Yeah, so there's a toilet on the ISS, there's a few toilets on the ISS.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.200
 One in particular.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.200
 You don't want to be called short.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.200
 Yeah.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.000
 And they have been.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 They have been.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.400
 Oh yeah, they've had some international problems as well.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.800
 When stuff on the ground is going wrong and let's say one toilet is clogged,

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.500
 maybe the Americans won't allow the Russians to use their toilet or vice versa.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.000
 They've had this, but there's a lot of problems.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 But they do have a tank that collects a urine.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.200
 Yeah, the urine then gets turned into drinkable water.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.800
 So it's reused and so on.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.200
 And this is not an official account.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.000
 It's very explicit that it's not affiliated with NASA.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 But there is an account on Blue Sky called the ISS PistTracker.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.600
 And it's because the data of how full the tanks are are available to the public.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.200
 And so and like it updates all the time.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.800
 So how full is the how full is the P tank right now right now?

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.100
 Should we have a game?

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.800
 Yeah, okay.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.800
 Is it sentage?

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.800
 Yeah, it's presented.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.800
 Okay, I'm going to say 37%.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.800
 You're saying 37%.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:59.800
 I've got 38%.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.800
 I'll just play the averages.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.800
 Okay.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.800
 I'm sorry.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.800
 I'll change it.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:05.800
 37.1%.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.800
 Unbelievable.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.800
 Okay, you sure?

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.800
 All right.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:16.800
 As of six minutes ago, the last update, it was 38% full.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.800
 You're joking.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.800
 No.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.800
 I said that.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.800
 Yeah, you did.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.800
 You pulled back to 37.1.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.800
 So you're still ahead.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.800
 Yeah, but you can only accept my first answer.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.800
 And the thing is, it's like, I knew I just I had a feeling it was 38.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.800
 And when Andy said 37, I thought, oh gosh, he's going to get really close.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.800
 But I know it's 38.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.800
 So I'm just going to go for 38.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.800
 Because you thought I went for 38 because it's one more than 37.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.800
 But that no, I had an in-clink.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.800
 And when you said just play the averages, that was just, that was just your code for I know it.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.800
 I just know it.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.800
 If you serious James got it bang on.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.800
 He got it bang on.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.800
 So if we done it 22 minutes ago, it was 36% full.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.800
 And you would have got it.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.800
 You would have got it.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.800
 But yes.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.800
 So I've got to start these shows on time.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.800
 I'm sorry.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.800
 Really annoyed.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:07.800
 I was looking into just urine in space and how it works in the international space station and general shuttles and so on.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:14.800
 And there was a mission in 1984 where something went wrong with the exit point of where the urine gets let out into space.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.800
 It froze up at the end.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.800
 There was a giant icicle.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.800
 And they were really worried because they thought that if it loosens up, it might crack the heat shields as we're going back down.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.800
 They almost did a spacewalk to sort of chisel it off.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.800
 But in the end, they had a robot arm that came and knocked it off and knocked it away.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.800
 Wow.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.800
 It also meant that once they'd got rid of it, the toilet was now out of order.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.800
 So for six days, they had to pee into plastic bags.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.800
 And also in space, really hard to pee because of the microgravity, right?

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.800
 So you've got to be very careful.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.800
 So how do you think you do it?

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:49.800
 You've got the bag.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.800
 Back for life.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.800
 It's going to be because the other flims you want to have small holes in the bottom, don't they?

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.800
 No use.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.800
 I assume these are more like what you'd put your sandwich in rather than I don't put your sandwich in there.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.800
 I don't think Sainsbury's bags made it to the ISS or challenge it.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.800
 Do you get in the bag?

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.800
 Have the pee.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.800
 How would that help?

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.800
 Because none of the peers get in the bag.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.800
 Someone holds it close.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.800
 Do you have your wee quickly?

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.800
 Then you just get out of the bag.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.800
 It doesn't make sense.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.800
 Put the bag on the penis.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.800
 This is for men.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.800
 A couple of crocodile clips.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.800
 Hold it in place.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.800
 Very nice idea.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.800
 Now we're thinking like astronauts.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.800
 Now we are.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.800
 Astronauts that did not make the cut.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:37.800
 No, what you would do is you would put socks in and you would put underwear in so that the liquid would instantly soak into something.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.800
 So they were losing their socks.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.800
 They were losing all of the clothing for six days while they were up there.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.800
 But they made it back safe.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.800
 So all good.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.800
 Right.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.800
 Here's one from Lauren Kramer.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:56.800
 And Spicer being completely landlocked and because of its man-made lakes and reservoirs, Oklahoma has more shoreline than the eastern west coast of the contiguous states combined.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.800
 It also has an international part because the river connects to the Mississippi.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.800
 Wait, Oklahoma has more shoreline than the eastern west coasts of America.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.800
 That's what they're saying.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.800
 But isn't Oklahoma part of the contiguous?

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.800
 Yes, but they don't have a Pacific or Atlantic coastline.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.800
 So saying that the shoreline in Oklahoma is more than the Pacific and the Atlantic combined.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.800
 What?

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.800
 Wow.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.800
 How can that be?

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.800
 Have you run the math?

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:35.800
 Well, I've looked into it and I think probably it's not true, unfortunately, because if you just take Alaska, the shoreline of Alaska is 33904 miles.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:44.800
 And according to the official Bureau, Oklahoma has 55,646 miles of shoreline on its lakes.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:54.800
 So if Alaska is like 60% of the total, probably once you add the east seaboard and western seaboard, then you're going to go above it.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.800
 So I think it's probably not true, but it was difficult for me to find the exact figures.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.800
 Wait, did you say Oklahoma on its lakes?

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.800
 And it's like, so basically Oklahoma has a ton of lakes.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.800
 And so they count a shoreline, all the shores of the lakes.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:15.800
 And it's like this thing that, you know, if you're a sooner state person, like you would just know that as a fact you're told as a kid.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.800
 I think probably it's not quite true.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:25.800
 Lauren also said that at high school she learned that Oklahoma has the world's largest salt flats, alabaster deposit and parakeet farm.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.800
 The largest salt flats is in Bolivia, the largest chips and deposits are in Spain.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.800
 And the parakeet farm closed in the 1950s after a fire.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.800
 So I'm sorry Lauren.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:43.800
 Oh, Lauren, you've experienced a writer passage for anyone involved in QI on those things, which is called a thorough harkening.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.800
 And it's like, it's never a nice experience, but you do come out of it a wiser person.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.800
 Yeah, I'm sorry, it's not Lauren's fault. She was told this at school.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.800
 James, that is, I know, but that is a thorough, that's a thorough job.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.800
 Because now Lauren, you get to watch when James dishes out of harkening to the next person.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.800
 And you can be like, yeah, it's a club.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.800
 Every other human being is in that club.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.800
 Who's farming parakeets?

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.800
 It was one person. It was one guy in Warrika.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.800
 Now I might have mispronounced that.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.800
 So Lauren might write in and say I've mispronounced it.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.800
 But they brought in just a few parakeets from abroad.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.800
 And then parakeets have like four or five babies every year.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.800
 And so by the 1950s, they had about 1500 breeding pairs.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:24.800
 Wow.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.800
 But then there was a fire and they never quite reached the former glory.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.800
 And now if you go on the internet and you google Oklahoma parakeets,

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.800
 you see Oklahoma was once the parakeet cups of the world and no one knows why.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.800
 Well, that's why we know.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.800
 I've got one, which I think is true from Tracy Thickston,

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:48.800
 a common British job used to be operating a shake willy machine.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.800
 That's in the ISS. What's we finished?

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.800
 Take off the crocodile clips. Shake your willy.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.800
 Get out of that bag.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.800
 This is so good.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.800
 So you know the word shoddy.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.800
 Dodgy.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.800
 Shoddy is dodgy.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:04.800
 Low quality.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.800
 It was like a kind of old cloth or something.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:07.800
 Shoddy, wasn't it?

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:08.800
 That's what it's about.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.800
 So I don't know if it's a whether it's traveled outside the UK.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.800
 I don't know if it's in America, Australia's house.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.800
 A bit of a shoddy job, isn't it?

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:15.800
 No, yeah, yeah.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:16.800
 So shoddy.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.800
 Okay.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.800
 Well, it was this cloth.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.800
 And it was a mix of ground up rags and virgin wool.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.800
 And it was then woven into new cloth.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:27.800
 And some of the makers started upping the amount of recycled material.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.800
 And that led to like low quality cloth.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.800
 Because the new stuff was getting more expensive.

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.800
 So the word gained the meaning shoddy, low quality.

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.800
 Shoddy just used to mean, oh, this is shoddy.

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:39.800
 You know, just, oh, what a nice piece of shoddy cloth.

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:40.800
 Great.

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:45.800
 Anyway, one of the steps of making the shoddy cloths was to do the willy ink in a shake willy machine.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:51.800
 What it meant was roughly cleaning the material to fluff it up and to remove any dirt.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.800
 Do you stop doing that with your hands while you tell us about it?

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:59.800
 And there are these census records of willyers, willy girls, willy men.

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.800
 Do we know why it's called willy?

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.800
 Is it because they got willy?

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:04.800
 Two theories.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.800
 One is that there were willow baskets involved.

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:11.800
 And one is that it's a derivation of winnowing where you're winnowing out the low quality stuff.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.800
 So you had to feed the willy into the shake willy and that fluffed it up.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.800
 And that got rid of the nips, which is the dust and the dirt.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:22.800
 The second willy ink machine is called the teaser, which is teasing it apart.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.800
 So as far as I can tell, you do the fluffing in the shake willy.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.800
 You get rid of the nips, put it through the teaser and then finally add the lubricant.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:29.800
 That's the process.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.800
 The Kenneth Williams, in fact, there's such a job.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.800
 Imagine what's your profession of a willy man.

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:34.800
 That's good.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:39.800
 I didn't, we were doing this recently with the Rachel Paris episode where we talked about extinct jobs.

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.800
 Yeah, I must admit, I had willy ink on my list.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:43.800
 Oh, yeah.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:44.800
 But we never got around to it.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:45.800
 That's surely extinct.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:46.800
 There's nobody willy ink these days.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:47.800
 No willy is now.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:48.800
 No.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:52.800
 There is a brilliant Yorkshire company called I knew you.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.800
 What?

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.800
 Was that your Yorkshire accent?

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:03.800
 It's what it's called I knew you, which is an abbreviation of it is not over until it is over.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.800
 It's almost all vows.

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.800
 Sorry, what's that stew with willy ink?

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:09.800
 They're recycling firm.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:10.800
 It's about recycling cloth.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:11.800
 I got it.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:20.800
 Yeah, and and Shoddy was pioneered in badly in Yorkshire by Benjamin Law, who founded a company called Shoddy Manufacturing, which is lovely.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:21.800
 Right, who's next?

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:22.800
 I'll go on.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.800
 This was sent into us by Jackie Gamel.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:36.800
 She writes, the reason airplanes have round windows is because old planes used to have square ones, which created weak points, which caused metal fatigue.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:42.800
 And metal fatigue failure would be where the window was weakened further by air pressure at high altitude.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.800
 And supposedly a few crashes were off the back of this.

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:49.800
 And so they now, as we all know, have circular windows.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.800
 And that is to distribute the pressure evenly.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.800
 Yeah, that's a strong, very strong shape, isn't that circle?

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:56.800
 Yeah.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:01.800
 I think now the materials are strong enough that you can get any shape of window.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.800
 Could you play that was all window?

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:04.800
 Yeah, now you can.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:05.800
 Wow.

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.800
 But people just wouldn't go for it.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.800
 I think I wouldn't either.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:10.800
 I think I would not go for that.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.800
 I would like to play where you can see into the hold.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.800
 So you look down and you're like, oh, there's my bag.

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:15.800
 Yeah.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:16.800
 Yeah, I think that'd be really great.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:17.800
 Do you think?

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.800
 I reckon you don't want to know what goes on in there.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:24.800
 I imagine some weird shit goes on in those holds.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.800
 Yeah, lots of Willie Shaken down there.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.800
 Well, like snakes on a plane kind of thing.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:29.800
 Yeah.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.800
 Yeah, I don't want to see snakes down there.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:36.800
 But a novelty glass bottom plane is a very interesting concept.

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:37.800
 Yeah.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:44.800
 Like that is quite interesting to I'm a terrified flyer, but even I think I might do that.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:45.800
 No.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:46.800
 Yeah.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:47.800
 Have you ever been in the glass bottom boat?

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:48.800
 I have.

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:49.800
 That's great fun.

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:50.800
 Thank you.

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:51.800
 Are you going to invent that?

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:52.800
 I'm well done.

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.800
 And we should say that event at the last moment.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.800
 And now he's going to do it again with the plane apparently.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.800
 What about an aeroplane?

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:03.800
 You know those rides at theme parks where you're not in a carriage.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.800
 You're sort of suspended by your shoulders.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:06.800
 Oh, the danglers.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:07.800
 You're a dangler.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:08.800
 What about Ryanair?

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.800
 Or it's a dangle all the way to Malaga.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:12.800
 Oh, my goodness.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.800
 So the plane has a top, but no bottom.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:15.800
 Yeah.

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:16.800
 That's a good idea.

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.800
 I'm thinking, you know, it saves a bit of money on fuselage.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.800
 It's going to make serving good drinks very tricky.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.800
 I'll say that.

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.800
 I guess the steel is hanging upside down.

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.800
 I suppose they could wish themselves along down because there's no bottom on the plane.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.800
 Why are they hanging upside down?

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.800
 Why are they not just attached the right way up like you are?

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.800
 They're all that players.

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.800
 Okay, okay.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:39.800
 I'm going to row back on that.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.800
 They can be the right way up.

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.800
 Now we're talking.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:47.800
 Remember to not let Andy pitch our weird roller coaster plane.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.800
 It will be stressful when you're coming into Lambo because it'll feel like

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:54.800
 you have to run very, very fast at a certain point to slow the plane down.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:55.800
 It's a Flintstones plane.

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:56.800
 It's a Flintstones plane.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:06.800
 Mark Loggy writes, in the 1760s Simon Harcott, the first L Harcott demolished the village

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:11.800
 of Noonham Courtney, as well as Noonham House, in order to make room for his garden.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:16.800
 And he rebuilt the entire village one mile to the northeast.

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:17.800
 Wow.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:18.800
 To make room for his garden.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:19.800
 Yeah.

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.800
 It feels to me like it's easier to move a garden than it is to demolish the village.

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.800
 The thing is about rich people.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.800
 They're not really bothered about what's easiest.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.800
 They're more bothered about what's more convenient for them.

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.800
 And what's affordable, like if that's just within your budget?

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:36.800
 I think for Simon Harcott, the first L Harcott, everything was within budgets.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:37.800
 There you go.

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.800
 And did just rebuild it correctly?

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:40.800
 Yeah.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.800
 So if you drive through that area now.

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:43.800
 Yeah.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.800
 So it's like basically from the M4 to the M40 up there.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.800
 You can go through Noonham Courtney.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:53.800
 And basically all the buildings are almost identical because he had to build them all at the same time

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.800
 for the people who removed from that village.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:57.800
 Wow.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:58.800
 Well, it's good that he rebuilt it.

00:13:58.800 --> 00:13:59.800
 I'll say that.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:00.800
 You know?

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:01.800
 Yeah.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.800
 I would be a bit annoyed if someone's telling me to move your house from my garden.

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.800
 But if it's, if you're putting it back.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.800
 What difference does it make if he removes everyone's, right?

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:09.800
 Yeah, no difference.

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:13.800
 I guess you're going to have a bit of time where the renovations going on is going to be quite inconvenient.

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.800
 Yeah, those jobs do stretch on, don't they?

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.800
 Especially if the builders would be quite busy because they've got to rebuild everyone's house.

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:19.800
 Yeah.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:23.800
 What would have been great as if one family happened to have gone away on like a really long trip.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.800
 And everyone decided not to tell them what had happened.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.800
 And there's just go on as normal.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.800
 I swear to God, we were closer to that.

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.800
 Am I getting nuts?

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.800
 Something else about Noonham Courtney.

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:35.800
 Yeah.

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.800
 I was looking into famous residents.

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:49.800
 Davis Lever, she was the person who broke the Italian Enigma code, which allowed the Royal Navy to ambush the Italian fleet at the Battle of Matapan, which was quite decisive.

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:53.800
 And she also broke the Abwehr Enigma, which was one of the German Enigmas.

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.800
 They had a few different codes that they used.

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:56.800
 Right.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:04.800
 And that one, she solved it with her colleague Margaret Rock, which led to the right saying, give me a lever and rock.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.800
 And I can move the universe, bloody brilliant.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.800
 That's what one of her bosses said.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:10.800
 That's really good.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:16.800
 Here's one.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:17.800
 It's from Jude Caffruini.

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:24.800
 This is maybe the most stoner fact in the inbox over the last, you know what I mean?

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:28.800
 Like the sort of woo, like the cause of cosmicly mind-blowing fact.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:29.800
 Let's hear it.

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.800
 The T-Rex is closer to us in time than it is to the Stegosaurus.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:34.800
 No, I really like this.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.800
 I love dinosaur timing facts.

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:37.800
 Yeah.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:44.800
 And this is that the T-Rex went extinct when they all did about 65, 6 million years ago.

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:45.800
 Right?

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.800
 But the T-Rex was actually quite new.

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:52.800
 It was only properly arrived in its final form at about 72 million years ago.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.800
 And I got really sad reading that.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:55.800
 And I thought, no, they had 6 million.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:56.800
 That's a lot of time.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:57.800
 That's such a long time.

00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:58.800
 I don't know what I got.

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:01.800
 I got a bit misty eye thinking, God, they were in their prime.

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:02.800
 They had so much to give.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.800
 They could have built their own HS2 in that time.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:06.800
 Exactly.

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:07.800
 Exactly.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:13.800
 But when that happened, when T-Rex arrived, 72 million years ago in the Lake Rotator's,

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:17.800
 Stegosaurus had already been extinct for over 70 million years.

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:22.800
 So the Stegosaurus and the T-Rex are further apart than the T-Rex is from us.

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:30.800
 Do you know that Sergeant Peppers, the album, is closer to the modern day than it is

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:33.800
 to when Cleopatra was alive?

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:34.800
 No way.

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:35.800
 Woo!

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.800
 And that's a stone effect, isn't it?

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.800
 [laughter]

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.800
 Sounds like an impressive fact until you actually listen to it.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:43.800
 That's my thing.

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:44.800
 [laughter]

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:48.800
 That was the thing with the name Jurassic Park, that often gets said,

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:52.800
 is that half the dinosaurs in the movie are not Jurassic.

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:56.800
 But it implies that the dinosaurs in the park would have been incredibly freaked out by each other.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.800
 They would have, like, the T-Rex would have been looking at the Stegosaurus.

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:00.800
 What is that?

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:01.800
 Yes.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.800
 Whereas the humans, they would have been relatively calm about, because we're closer in time to them,

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.800
 so they'd be like, oh yeah, it's a normal, you know what I mean?

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:08.800
 Yeah, it's an interesting point.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:09.800
 I don't think so.

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:10.800
 [laughter]

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:11.800
 It's not an interesting point.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:12.800
 Oh no.

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.800
 Oh, I retract mine as well.

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:17.800
 No, you can't retract your point just because it's going with J.

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:22.800
 If you look now at an animal that was extinct 55 million years ago,

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:26.800
 and then you see an animal, which hasn't been invented yet,

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:31.800
 and will come in 20 million years, even though it's closer to you, which is going to be more surprising.

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:32.800
 Yeah.

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:33.800
 Yeah, okay.

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:34.800
 Yeah, all right.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:35.800
 I retract.

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:36.800
 Yeah.

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:37.800
 Take that.

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.800
 All the way in my point was not interesting.

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:40.800
 You've been harkened.

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:41.800
 [laughter]

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.800
 Oh, it's tough.

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:44.800
 It's tough.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.800
 But the T-Rex used to be the size of a Dalmatian.

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:47.800
 When it started.

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:48.800
 Ages ago.

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:49.800
 Yeah, yeah.

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:50.800
 Right.

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:51.800
 I think that's cool.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:52.800
 Three meters long and 30 kilos.

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:56.800
 Was that a T-Rex or like another Tyrannosaur, like a related Tyrannosaur?

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:57.800
 It was an ancestor.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:00.800
 It was what eventually turned into the T-Rex.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:05.800
 Because I wonder if a baby T-Rex when it's born is already bigger than that size.

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.800
 Three meters is a big egg, isn't it?

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:08.800
 Yeah.

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:09.800
 Oh, that's true.

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:10.800
 Anyway, there you go.

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:11.800
 Here's one.

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.800
 This is from Ron Lebach.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:21.800
 And Ron says that Case Western Reserve University, which is home of the famous physics study,

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:26.800
 the Michelson-Molly Experiment, which disproved that the ether existed,

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:29.800
 of looking at me like you know what that means.

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:34.800
 The theory was that the earth was going through some kind of air or some kind of field,

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:37.800
 but actually it turned out that it's going through space and these guys proved it.

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:45.800
 Anyway, this university, they test whether or not Galileo's theorem of gravity is true

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:52.800
 every Halloween by dropping two jumbo size pumpkins from the top of the auditorium building.

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:56.800
 And the idea is they could be different weights, but they should land at the same time.

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:57.800
 Right.

00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:00.800
 And Spyler Alert, gravity works and they are.

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.800
 Good to check every year, though.

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:03.800
 You never know.

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:04.800
 You never know.

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:05.800
 It might change.

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:06.800
 Yeah, I think it is fun.

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.800
 Scientists have to check these things.

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:10.800
 And it brought me onto pumpkins.

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:12.800
 I've done a bit of my own research on pumpkins.

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:17.800
 There's an old cuifacts that 95% of pumpkins in the UK are not eaten.

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:22.800
 Because we basically buy them and turn them into jackalandsons and then throw them away.

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:24.800
 But actually that is not true anymore.

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:26.800
 That fact is really really old.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:31.800
 But there was a 2024 survey that found about 37% of pumpkins are eaten.

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:35.800
 Which is just under the amount of urine currently sitting inside the ISS P tank.

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.800
 That's food for thought.

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.800
 But it's still not enough.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:45.800
 And there is a campaign run by Hubbub which is a charity for the environment.

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:50.800
 And someone called Emily Gusson who wrote something called don't waste your pumpkin.

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.800
 To try and get people to eat pumpkins.

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:55.800
 And they have like pumpkin recipes.

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:59.800
 And just what raise awareness of not wasting food.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:04.800
 And they claimed that they've almost halved pumpkin waste in the last year.

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:05.800
 Wow.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:06.800
 So that's really good work for them.

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:12.800
 So if you're listening to this, it's three weeks after Halloween already.

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:13.800
 But don't despair.

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:17.800
 If you've still got a few pumpkins there, just scrape off the mold.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:18.800
 They might still be good.

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:20.800
 Can I just do one more thing?

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.800
 Because I have an extra one that we never got to.

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.800
 And I did lots of extra research for it.

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:30.800
 So Frederico Santa wrote that if Tom and Jerry was made in ancient Rome,

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.800
 Tom instead of being a cat would have been a weasel.

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:40.800
 And that's because according to Frederico, the Romans had pet weasels instead of pet cats to get rid of mice and stuff.

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:41.800
 Lovely.

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:44.800
 They found the website called foundinantiquity.com.

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.800
 And they have a really, really long explanation of this.

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.800
 And they don't think it's true.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:52.800
 They think that weasels were not used as pets.

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:56.800
 They were in the houses, but they were kind of a pest themselves.

00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:01.800
 But the reason I wanted to say it is because they found on this website that this theory

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:09.800
 was first theorized in 1718 by Magnus Radilius and Andreas E. Weasel.

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:17.800
 And they reckon that maybe he came up with this theory that they had pet weasels because his name was Mr Weasel.

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:18.800
 Amazing.

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:19.800
 Amazing.

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:22.800
 Oh, Frederico, you've been harkened.

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.800
 That's good, though.

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:26.800
 That's very interesting.

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.800
 Yeah, I think the jury's still slightly out.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:32.800
 Because they're in the house. I mean, that's a big animal to have a new house as a pest.

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:36.800
 Yeah, but a lot of the sources when they talk about these weasels,

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:40.800
 they talk about them in the same as you would say there is a fly in the house.

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:45.800
 Or there's a mouse in the house or a rat in the house is like an annoying thing.

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:46.800
 Right.

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.800
 Are they basically like ferrets?

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:50.800
 Well, they are smaller than ferrets.

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.800
 And the other thing is ferrets actually are quite easy to tame.

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:58.800
 And like I have a friend said, who I don't know if he still has a pet ferret, but he definitely used to.

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.800
 Then John Mitchinson from QI used to have a pet ferret.

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:01.800
 Oh, that's right.

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:02.800
 Yeah.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:06.800
 But I think weasel, they're just a little bit angry and I think they don't make good pets.

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:07.800
 Do we get them in the UK?

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:08.800
 I can't actually.

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:09.800
 Oh, yeah.

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:10.800
 We go weasels.

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:11.800
 Yeah.

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:12.800
 Good fats.

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:13.800
 Old QI fats.

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.800
 Most weasels in the UK are least weasels.

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:17.800
 Yeah.

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:21.800
 Because there's a species called the least weasel, which is the most common one in the UK.

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:22.800
 That's lovely.

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:26.800
 I think we have a fact in the inbox someone saying, sorry, I don't remember the correspondent now,

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:29.800
 but the least weasel is currently rated as least concerned.

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:32.800
 Which is nice because the population's kind of doing all right.

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:33.800
 Yeah.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:36.800
 My, my old neighbor used to take a ferret for a walk on a lead.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:37.800
 Okay.

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:39.800
 As a pet, which is a cool thing to do.

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:40.800
 I think it's cool.

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:41.800
 Yes.

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:42.800
 Yes.

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:43.800
 You do.

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:44.800
 Okay.

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:45.800
 Okay.

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:46.800
 Okay.

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:50.800
 Let's go to inaugurating the latest members of the friend of the podcast.

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:51.800
 Very big.

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:52.800
 Exciting.

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:57.800
 Anyone who has signed up to Clubfish at the friend of the podcast here gets one of our headline

00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:58.800
 facts in perpetuity.

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:03.800
 You are then the sponsor, patron, whatever you like of that fact, and you get a little shoutout

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:04.800
 on this show.

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:05.800
 That's what we're trying to say here.

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.800
 So we should, we should do some shoutouts.

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:10.800
 Guys, we've had a bit of a rush on membership of friend of the podcast.

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.800
 So we are going to up the pace.

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:17.800
 And of the number of shoutouts we give a show and and and get through a few more.

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:21.800
 So we're sorry we may not get to some of you for a little while, but your names are in the

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:22.800
 system.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.800
 And we're going to try really hard to get through them.

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:26.800
 There's been a swell.

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:31.560
 You know those companies when you ring them and they say, sorry, we're having an unexpected

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:34.800
 large number of calls, but they say it absolutely every single day.

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:35.800
 Yeah.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:36.800
 We're going to have that.

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:38.800
 I'm afraid we've experienced unprecedented demand.

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:39.800
 Yeah.

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:41.800
 And we're going to be dealing with it in a precedented way.

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:45.800
 So your fact will be dealt with in around seven months.

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.800
 It'll be before then we hope.

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:48.800
 Before then we hope.

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:49.800
 Let's do it.

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:50.800
 Right.

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:51.800
 Let's do some right today.

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:54.800
 Shout out number one goes to Orion Slater.

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:55.800
 Brilliant.

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:56.800
 What a terrific name.

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:57.800
 Orion.

00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:58.800
 Three stars.

00:23:58.800 --> 00:23:59.800
 Lovely.

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:00.800
 Lovely.

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:01.800
 He.

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:04.800
 Orion must be absolutely sick of that.

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:05.800
 Um, belt up.

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:06.800
 There we go.

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:07.800
 Very good.

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:13.800
 Anyway, Orion, your fact is that the earliest known dentistry is 9,000 years old.

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:14.800
 Yes.

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:16.800
 So what's the most exciting thing about this fact?

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:19.800
 Is it's not one of our facts or even one of ours?

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:20.800
 That's right.

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:21.800
 It's Greg Jenner's.

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:22.800
 Historian Greg Jenner.

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.800
 And this was our third episode.

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:25.800
 Yeah.

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:29.800
 And Greg Jenner and comedian Alex Edelman were sitting there with me in James for this episode.

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:30.800
 So.

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:31.800
 Where was I?

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:32.800
 I think you.

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:34.800
 I think you didn't really care about the show at that point.

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:36.800
 It's sort of a bit loose and goosey.

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:37.800
 And I've maintained that.

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:39.800
 I know.

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:43.800
 And you know, stays. Yeah, we did two in one day actually.

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:44.800
 Do you remember?

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.800
 And we got Greg and Alex to come in and do a show.

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:50.800
 And then as soon as we finished, as soon as the mics went off, they came back on again.

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:52.800
 And we did a show with the four of us.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:53.800
 That's right.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.800
 They basically came in to have a cup of tea.

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:56.800
 James and I said one.

00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:58.800
 We just make an episode instead while they're here.

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:00.800
 So yeah, well done to Orion Slater.

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:01.800
 Great fact.

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:02.800
 Ancient dentistry.

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:03.800
 Let's have another.

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:04.800
 Okay.

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:06.800
 Well, this one is going to Christine and Tom Asbridge.

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:12.800
 And the fact is that according to Dr. Hans Ulrich, the middle ages never happened.

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:17.800
 This is a wild theory called Phantom Time Hypothesis.

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:20.800
 Largely put into the show because we knew that Greg would be horrified.

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:23.800
 He was sitting on a show that was discussing this particular thing.

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:24.800
 It just puts that in really.

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:25.800
 Wasn't it?

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:26.800
 Yeah, in a friendly way.

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:27.800
 We did, we did like it.

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:29.800
 But that was the idea.

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:30.800
 Yeah.

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:35.800
 And the excited thing about that one is that this is a special medieval fact requested by Christine.

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:39.800
 For Tom, who is a medieval historian and writer.

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:44.800
 So we're not going to say you can request your facts if you're a friend of the podcast.

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:49.800
 But you can put a little note in, you know, like where you put a allergic to nuts or something.

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:50.800
 Yeah.

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:55.800
 But as the guy who does the emails, I'd like to specify that as the chef in this restaurant, I may put nuts in anyway.

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.800
 That's absolutely.

00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:01.800
 Well, while I'm these reply to emails, he may be touching nuts.

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:05.800
 So let's go to the next one.

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:13.800
 It was the fact is the most medically indispensable sea creature in the United States is the horse shoe crab.

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:17.800
 And that was an originally a fact from Alex Edelman.

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:18.800
 Lovely.

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:19.800
 A good friend.

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:20.800
 Like he's in the room.

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:26.800
 But now it is under the custodian ship of Anna, also known as Anna MC Anna Mac.

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:31.800
 She's a regular contributor to various emails and stuff like that.

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:32.800
 Yeah.

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:33.800
 Congratulations Anna.

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:34.800
 Yeah.

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:35.800
 And I like that.

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:39.800
 I do like the fact that the most medically indispensable sea creature in the United States.

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:42.800
 Like it's qualifier city, isn't it?

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:43.800
 Yeah.

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:44.800
 Yeah.

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:47.800
 I think Alex had just read a documentary or watched a documentary about the horseshoe crab.

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:48.800
 Right.

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:49.800
 And just wanted to talk about that.

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.800
 I love the idea of reading a documentary.

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:53.800
 It feels like it's something kind of thing you would do, James.

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:57.800
 Well, you print out the transcript of the documentary and then you read it because you'll do it faster

00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:59.800
 and it won't be irritating pictures in the way.

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:00.800
 Yeah.

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:01.800
 I have a friend who reads all of our podcasts.

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:02.800
 Doesn't listen to them.

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:03.800
 Reads them.

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:04.800
 Wow.

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:05.800
 Yeah.

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:06.800
 I mean, you read famously.

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:07.800
 You read.

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:08.800
 It's rips of toy stories.

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:09.800
 Oh, far of them.

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:12.800
 Never seen the films.

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.800
 Did you cry at the right bits?

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:15.800
 Yeah.

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:17.800
 Just dripped on the printout.

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:18.800
 Couldn't read the next bit.

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:19.800
 Oh, dear.

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:20.800
 Right.

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:21.800
 Let's have another fact.

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:25.800
 Is going to double o die names.

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:26.800
 Dynamies.

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:28.800
 It's a terrific name.

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:33.800
 And it's that Queen Elizabeth slept in a bedroom with 28 women.

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:36.800
 So congratulations, double o.

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.800
 It's the Bonnie blew of her time.

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:40.800
 That's rude.

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:41.800
 Is it?

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.800
 I'm going to pretend I don't know who that is.

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:44.800
 Me too.

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:45.800
 Me too.

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:50.800
 I think that was the vibe we were going for to try and do a bit of a new end up.

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:54.800
 But actually, this was the fact that she had lots of handmaids and stuff.

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.800
 You used to sit and sleep in her bedroom.

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:58.800
 Yeah, they'd watch her give birth as well.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:27:59.800
 Queen Elizabeth first.

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:02.800
 Did you have changed history then?

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:03.800
 That's huge.

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:04.800
 Sorry.

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:09.800
 I was thinking about the chambermaids who would stay and and births in those periods.

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:11.800
 I've been viewed by huge parties.

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:14.800
 So for Queen Elizabeth first, nicknamed the Virgin Queen.

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.800
 I think probably that wouldn't have been a big part of the jobs back.

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:20.800
 Not the nickname of Bonnie blew.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:21.800
 Okay.

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:22.800
 Well, I don't know who that is.

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:23.800
 That's right.

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:24.800
 Carry on.

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:25.800
 So the next one.

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:26.800
 I'll do this one.

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:30.800
 It's the 30 million Chinese people living caves.

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:35.800
 And that fact is now under the custodianship of Nathan Morgan.

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:36.800
 Congratulations, Nathan.

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:39.800
 It feels like a fact that we'll have undergone some depreciation.

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:42.800
 Yeah, I think it was a fact of its time.

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:46.800
 It could have been an appreciation because the population's gone up a long way in the last 11 years.

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:47.800
 Yeah.

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:48.800
 What of China?

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:49.800
 Oh yeah.

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:50.800
 I suppose it has.

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:51.800
 Yeah, definitely.

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:53.800
 I feel like the housing boom in China might have might have.

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.800
 There's lots of rural bits of China that there are.

00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:59.800
 But increasingly more people live in these mega cities, don't they?

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:00.800
 Yeah.

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:01.800
 Yeah.

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:04.800
 It's interesting that we can now say we've been going so long that we can talk about our own facts

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:05.800
 and say, well, that was a different time.

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:06.800
 Yeah.

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:07.800
 And it's us we're talking about.

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:08.800
 Well, it's weird.

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:11.800
 If you listen back to that episode, you'd probably hear yourself saying stuff where you're going,

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:12.800
 what am I talking about?

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:13.800
 I don't know that.

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:14.800
 When did I say that?

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:16.800
 I mean, that happens with every episode by the last three.

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:17.800
 Yeah.

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:18.800
 Like, I just, I'm just like, who's this guy?

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:19.800
 He sounds handsome.

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:24.800
 Are you one of those people always get to be a few mixed up?

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:25.800
 I have.

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:27.800
 Every time I look at the mirror, I'm shocked.

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:29.800
 Not have your face.

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:31.800
 Shall I do one?

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:32.800
 Yeah.

00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:33.800
 All right.

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:34.800
 Hello, Alex Teewski.

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:38.800
 You have just become the custodian of this fact from James Harkin.

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:43.800
 There is a banker in Latvia who will lend you money using your immortal soul as security.

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:44.800
 That's great.

00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:45.800
 Is he still going?

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:46.800
 I'm not sure.

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:52.800
 I'll tell you why I did this fact because our first, I think our first ever listener was Gattis

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:56.800
 who is or who was the advertising partner of my wife.

00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:00.800
 And I sent him the episode to see what he thought about it.

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:02.800
 And that was before it went online or anything.

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:03.800
 And he is from Latvia.

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:05.800
 So I thought we'd do a little Latvian fact.

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:06.800
 I know.

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:07.800
 That's so cool.

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:08.800
 That is cool.

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:09.800
 Our first listener.

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:10.800
 That's great.

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:11.800
 I think he is.

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:12.800
 Well, that's a great fact.

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:14.800
 I'll do another one.

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:16.800
 This is another Anna.

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:22.200
 Anna, your fact forever is that for a hundred years, almost all maps of Africa contained a fictional

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:25.800
 mountain range called the mountains of Kong.

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:30.800
 So to clarify, that was a fact that was said by Anna.

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:31.800
 Yes.

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:35.800
 But it's now under the custodianship of another Anna.

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:36.800
 Whose surname we don't know.

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:37.800
 She's just Anna.

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:38.800
 Exactly.

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:42.800
 And Anna has signed up to be a friend of the podcast.

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:43.800
 Not a chance.

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:44.800
 No, she doesn't.

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.800
 She doesn't listen to the main show, let alone whatever we're doing now.

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:49.800
 She doesn't know this exists.

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:54.800
 I spoke to her last week and then she says she has been listening to the episodes and really enjoying them.

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:55.800
 Oh, okay.

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:56.800
 So Anna has been replaced.

00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:57.800
 Yeah.

00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:59.800
 Motherhood has done a really weird thing to her second time around.

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.800
 She did look very tired.

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:04.800
 That's a great fact.

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:07.800
 I think that's a really fun fact in the mountains of Kong.

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:08.800
 It's a huge mountain range.

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:09.800
 Everyone said, well, you can't go that way.

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:10.800
 What about the mountains of Kong?

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:12.800
 And they just weren't there.

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:16.800
 That one feels weirdly like an OG classic of fish.

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:17.800
 Absolutely.

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:19.800
 Here is one more for this week.

00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:25.800
 So male Pennsylvania grassbiders are much like clear to approach a female who has already killed

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.800
 and eaten a male.

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:29.800
 That feels like an Anna fact, doesn't it?

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.800
 But actually it was one of yours, Andy.

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:35.800
 But now it is under the custodianship of Alva Klausen.

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:36.800
 Well done, Alva.

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:37.800
 It's a good fact.

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:42.800
 Male Pennsylvania grassbiders are much like you to approach a female who has already

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:43.800
 killed and eaten a male.

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.800
 Which is crazy, right?

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:46.800
 Because she's got a form.

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:47.800
 But she's full.

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:48.800
 You see what I mean?

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:49.800
 Yes.

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:52.800
 The killer wouldn't possibly want to kill again.

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:55.800
 No, that's what they say about serial killers, isn't it?

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:56.800
 Once you've killed once.

00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:58.800
 It's not a told more-ish.

00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:10.800
 You bump into, oh god, no, no, no, no, don't worry, I already did once tonight.

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:11.800
 Just want to hang.

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:12.800
 Yeah, great.

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:13.800
 Well, there you go.

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:16.800
 That is this week's batch of fact custodians.

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:20.800
 Thank you so much to all of you who've signed up at frankly any tier of club fish.

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:22.800
 It's a joy to have you on board.

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:26.800
 We will be back again in another week's time with another little fish.

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:29.800
 We'll be back in less time than that with another main episode of the show.

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:33.800
 And for members of Club Fish, we'll be back in an indeterminate amount of time

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:35.800
 with a drop as a line our audience feedback show.

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:36.800
 Clear?

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:37.800
 Clear.

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:38.800
 Great.

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:39.800
 Bye.
