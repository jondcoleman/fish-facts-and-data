00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:18.940
 Hello and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:24.940
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here next to James Harkin, who is sitting next to Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:38.420
 and then rounding off the circle in between Andrew and myself is Anarch Zinsky, and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.760
 Starting with you, the man sitting next to me, James Harkin.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:49.720
 And if at home you can work out because there's only one man sat next to Dan, if you remember the situation of us all around the table.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.360
 Genius.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.480
 So who's it? Me.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:01:01.980
 Yeah, sorry. My fact this week is that animal metabolism was first proven by Antoine Lavoisier in an experiment where he put a guinea pig in a freezer.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.100
 Okay, so a couple of caveats to this, freezers haven't been invented yet.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.100
 [laughter]

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.100
 It's the first time.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.700
 So it was in an ice calorimeter, which is a container inside another container, which is full of ice.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.440
 So it's a way that people would keep things cool in those days, but it's not a freezer per se, I wouldn't say.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.960
 It's kind of like a thermos flask, but it's got ice instead of a vacuum.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:27.560
 Yes.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.960
 Okay, yeah, that's fair enough.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:38.560
 But it was important that it was ice rather than a vacuum because it was the amount of ice that melted, which he measured, and that worked out how much heat was given off by the guinea pig.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.160
 And it was heat just from living from the guinea pig, and he realized that this was a kind of metabolism.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:55.520
 Which is a bit like combustion, so combustion is where you burn organic material to get energy, and metabolism is where you kind of burn sugars to get energy for the body, and he worked out that these two were kind of the same thing.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.840
 Mmm.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.400
 And I thought he'd sort of invented the device.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.640
 Or was it there anyway?

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.640
 I don't know about that.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:11.600
 The way I heard it describe, which is quite good, to visualise, is like one of those water coolers in an office, but so it had the guinea pig in the middle, and then it had another water cooler around it with the ice,

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.840
 and then it had another water cooler around it with snow, didn't it, because he had to insulate the ice.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.080
 I don't know where he was getting used to amounts of snow, so he stuffed the outside with snow, so the ice didn't melt for other reasons.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.600
 It's amazing, guys, though. Like, I wouldn't be surprised if he did invent that, because the guy invented so much.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:34.640
 I mean, he's a bit new to me, I have to say, but, you know, he created oxygen, and thank God for him, because before that, it was really hard to create.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.240
 He created carbon dioxide, like we all do.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.240
 Oh, yeah, he created that, but then he found the word oxygen.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.080
 Yeah, he coined, yeah.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:55.360
 Because he, so obviously, priestly is the person that most people associate with oxygen, because priestly worked out that this weird thing was happening during combustion, and so he went to Lavoisier, and said, hey, look at this, and it was Lavoisier, who kind of explained it.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:03.200
 But I think priestly didn't think it was oxygen that was being generated. He thought it was deflogisticated air.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:13.600
 That is. So the idea was that there was a substance called flogistone, which was in lots and lots of materials, and it really wanted to burn. So once you burn something, it was released.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:20.960
 So basically, as soon as you burn something, the flogistone was released, and then you just had, well, oxygen left over, but he just thought it was deflogisticated air.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:29.200
 And I think for the next 30 years of his life, he refused to believe Lavoisier's rival and correct interpretation of what oxygen was, and continued to call it deflogisticated air.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:38.880
 In fairness, they're pretty much the same thing, but just with one of them a way worse name. The weird thing is, he did all of this stuff on his day off, which is so cool.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:48.200
 So he was a taxman, really. He had a vast tax organisation, it was Paris's chief taxman, basically. And he worked six hours, he worked six hours every week.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.960
 No, he worked six days a week.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:59.160
 For 20 years, he worked six days a week, and he did all his science, his experiments on one day a week, and he did a little bit of work in the mornings.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:13.160
 And that actually led to his death partly, his job as a taxman, because he was guillotineed on trumped up charges of tax fraud, but really he'd been really unpopular since the time he suggested a wall around Paris.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.600
 He suggested a seventh wall around Paris.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.920
 I can't imagine why anyone would object to the political suggestion of a wall.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:27.160
 He said it was to make the tax system fairer, and a lot of people said it's not that it's to squeeze the poor, and it got torn down in the revolution.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:46.160
 As a tax collector, he was quite reformist, and I think a lot of people say that he probably wouldn't have been beheaded during the French Revolution, if it weren't for the fact that he really pissed off Marat, didn't he, who was notorious kind of quite bloodthirsty revolutionary, but who also fancied himself as a scientist.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:05:00.160
 So Marat wanted to get into the Academy of Sciences where Lavoisier was very influential. Marat believed in stuff like animal magnetism, which we've talked about before, and he said he could see things like magnetism and mesmerism leaking from objects.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.160
 He said he saw it leaking from the head of Benjamin Franklin, for instance.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:10.160
 So he applied to the Academy of Sciences with these theories, and Lavoisier said, "No, you can't come in. This sounds like nonsense to me."

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:16.160
 He held a grudge against him ever since, and it was him who said, "As soon as the opportunity arose, let's chop that guy's head off." He insulted me.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.160
 He saw a lot of stuff leaking from Lavoisier's head.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:33.160
 Actually, what happened was, in fact, this didn't happen, but there is a myth that Lavoisier asked one of his assistants, because he was a great scientist, to watch him as he had his head chopped off, and he was going to keep blinking and to see how long he blinked more after the chop off.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.160
 That is so cool.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.160
 Wait, but that didn't happen.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:46.160
 That's a famous myth, isn't it? I didn't know that was to do with him. That's so cool. Just on his head, a century after he died, there was a statue that was erected of him up in Paris.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.160
 But no one quite noticed at the time that it wasn't his head on the statue. They'd used the wrong head.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:06:03.160
 Basically, the guy who was sculpting it didn't have enough money, so he found a spare head, and it was the secretary of the Academy of Sciences, who was there during Lavoisier's last years, and they used his head instead on the thing.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.160
 I think the idea was he was going to sculpt Lavoisier's head over it.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:12.160
 When you said they used it said they obviously didn't plant his head on top of a statue. I mean, they used him as a model to sculpt his head.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:18.160
 No, they used like an old statue head of it. Obviously, it wasn't like the first one going to his head.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.160
 But not the actual, not an actual head.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.160
 No, this is a century after he died.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.160
 How many statues have actual heads on the top of them?

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:30.160
 You can tell with a statue, if the horse has got one leg off the ground, they die in battle.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.160
 If it has the person's actual head, they die in a guillotine accident.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.160
 They did some weird shit back there.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.160
 Guillotine accident.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.160
 Guillotine accident.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:43.160
 I keep dropping this. I wasn't even meant to be used for that.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:48.160
 It's really sad though, because he was exonerated a year and a half after his death.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.160
 That's only 18 months for a rapid turnaround in his reputation, and he had a massive funeral.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:07:00.160
 3,000 people came, there was a hundred strong choir singing, and there was a bust of him, which was crowned with a reed and this huge tomb,

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.160
 all despite the fact that his body was headless and buried in a mass grave somewhere.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.160
 Was the revolution?

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.160
 Yeah.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.160
 When he was 28, he married this 13-year-old.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:17.160
 And he put this girl to work translating scientific papers from different countries.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.160
 And then basically, once he got all this stuff translated, he then magically discovered things.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.160
 Oh, okay.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.160
 She was awesome though.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.160
 She was so cool.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:34.160
 Yeah, Marianne, Pierreette, Paul's, and yeah, she was 13, but I think she liked him a lot and she married him to get away from marrying a 50-year-old.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:42.160
 It was her father who effectively got them married to this 50-year-old count.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.160
 Apparently, he used to come around their house and they'd play board games together.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.160
 So it's a beautiful romance if you discount the 13-year-old thing.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.160
 But she was scientifically very adept.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:56.160
 It's thought on a lot of the stuff that he did and may have involved her, but she wouldn't have accredited.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.160
 She did amazing scientific drawings and stuff.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.160
 Yeah.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:05.160
 You know there was one experiment he did where he kept a pelican full of water at boiling point for a hundred and a half days.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.160
 What?

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.160
 A hundred and a hundred and one consecutive days.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.160
 Well, it must have been dead after the first 20 minutes.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:15.160
 Well, the thing you need to know about this is that a pelican is a kind of specialist water container.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:19.160
 How did you guys go, though?

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:25.160
 I quite like the fact that he was able to sort of do the foundations of metabolism off this one experiment.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:31.160
 Because people have been toying with it for a very long time and it must have really annoyed one guy in particular called Santoria Santoria.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.160
 You read about him?

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:41.160
 He spent 30 years using a chair device to weigh himself and everything that he ate and drank as well as his urine and feces.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:46.160
 And the idea was he was comparing the weight of what he'd eaten and that was coming out, the waste products.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:54.160
 So the whole point was to work out the foundations of metabolism, but 30 years and he didn't really get to a final point of it.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:09:00.160
 All mate puts a guinea pig in a freezer and I don't think it would have been that pestle because he'd been dead for at least 150 years.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.160
 Oh, yeah.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.160
 I didn't look at the birth and death date.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.160
 That's true.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.160
 Cool.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.160
 Actually, I feel better about that.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:10.160
 If you were doing that experiment, you really wouldn't want to mix up the tray on which you weigh all your food.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.160
 And then the tray on which you weigh all your pieces would you?

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.160
 You'd probably label them.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.160
 Yeah.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:24.160
 But the idea, is the logic presumably behind what he did was that he was trying to prove that what he ate weighed much more than what was coming out of it.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.160
 Yes.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.160
 And so it obviously was his theory proven to be correct.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:35.160
 And the overarching theory of kind of existence as we have it now is that whatever goes in has to come out in some form.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.160
 Like whatever matter goes in, that amount of matter has to come out.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.160
 Yeah.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.160
 So if it's not being pooed out, it's coming out somewhere else.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.160
 Exactly.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:48.160
 And he worked out that for every eight pounds of food he ate, he excreted only three pounds of feces.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:55.160
 And he worked out that about half a pound of air was coming out of his mouth and various stuff coming out of different parts of his body.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:10:00.160
 And this was all in his 1614 book, "Arse de Statica de Medicina."

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.160
 Arse.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.160
 Arse.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.160
 It's obviously art.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.160
 Come on.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:08.160
 That's Latin for art.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.160
 Or work, I guess.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.160
 Yeah.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.160
 Did he, it was consistent for him?

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:16.160
 Did he, like, would he be up to dinner suddenly feel the need to poo and sort of have to dash off to the lab?

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.160
 So what makes me think, oh, you mean did he do it every single day?

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.160
 Yeah.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.160
 I don't think people went out to restaurants in the same way.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.160
 Did they?

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.160
 They haven't been invented at that time.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.160
 Not really.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.160
 Dinner party maybe then.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.160
 Yeah.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:32.160
 If you invite him over to dinner, maybe he brought his contraption with him.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.160
 He just left his feces tray by the door.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.160
 No dietary requirements.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:42.160
 But I will need to weigh.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:50.160
 So one of the things that's crucial to metabolism, which we all learned in GCSE biology is enzymes, huge deal, right?

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.160
 So enzymes are the thing that speeds up all metabolic processes.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:11:00.160
 But I just always find it so amazing that these things would happen if enzymes didn't exist.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:04.160
 So the enzymes are the proteins that sit there and they tell processes to happen.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:09.160
 And they tell different molecules to pair up with each other and process things.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:13.160
 And if they didn't exist, then things would happen much more slowly.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:19.160
 So for instance, there's an enzyme called phosphatase, which is used for things like signaling between ourselves

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:23.160
 and like transmitting hormone impulses between us, totally necessary for life.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:28.160
 And one little reaction involving phosphatase takes 10 milliseconds.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:33.160
 Without that enzyme, it would take one trillion years.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:37.160
 So you would still be able to eat and still pour it out.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.160
 Yeah.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.160
 But you'd be pouring it out a trillion years in a few days.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.160
 Yeah, I mean more.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.160
 Yeah.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.160
 And it's just like a hundred times longer than the universe has been around.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.160
 But it's a long way.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.160
 If you took all the enzymes out of someone, you fed them a snack.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:50.160
 What would happen?

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.160
 So all the stuff would go into your body.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.160
 Yeah.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.160
 And your body would still try to excrete it.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.160
 So yeah, you just wouldn't digest it.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.160
 So you wouldn't get any of the any of the energy or anything like that.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.160
 So you'd just be reusable.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.160
 Really.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.160
 You wouldn't need different trays.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.160
 Yeah.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:13.160
 So there's, I read a really cool thing about metabolism,

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.160
 which is about the difference between a shrew and an elephant's metabolism.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.160
 Yeah.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:20.160
 So shrews have very, very fast metabolism.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.160
 Their heart's got 1,500 beats per minute.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:25.160
 And they have to eat twice their body weight every day.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.160
 Twice their body weight every single day.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:34.160
 But every gram of its body uses 67 times more oxygen than a single gram of a human body.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:37.160
 So they have incredibly fast metabolism, they digest.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.160
 Yes, just I mean they have to breathe in lots of oxygen.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.160
 It does.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:45.160
 Yeah, they need way more oxygen proportional to their body than elephants do.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:49.160
 Whereas elephants that was the SSA online about why elephants don't explode.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:50.160
 So what?

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.160
 So elephants have trillions more cells on their inside.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.160
 So they're much hotter on the inside.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:59.160
 Because their insides are proportionally bigger than their skins.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.160
 An elephant is 250,000 times larger than a mouse,

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.160
 but it's only got 5,000 times the surface area.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:08.160
 So then the big problem is how to let all that heat out.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:12.160
 And elephants, as a result, have a much slower metabolism.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.160
 So they don't burn food or fuel at the same rate.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.160
 They run much, much cooler than a mouse or a shrew,

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:22.160
 which has little heaters turned up really, really high.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.160
 And so it gets through a lot of fuel really, really fast.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.160
 So it's just that they slow their metabolism, but doesn't that mean?

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.160
 Because the shrew is still covered in fur.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.160
 So they must be hot all the time.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.160
 Yeah, they're always running around.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.160
 They're just always running around.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.160
 Yeah, they're probably really.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.160
 Back to any pig when he got in the freezer must have been like,

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.160
 "Oh, fuck, that's it."

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:46.160
 I was really a tiny bit about guinea pigs and about guinea pig shows.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.160
 So they're quite a big thing and they've been a big thing.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.160
 They've been a big thing.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.160
 They're like dog shows.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.160
 They've been around since Victorian times.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.160
 And now people take them really seriously.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:01.160
 So there are over 400 guinea pig shows in Britain every year.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:02.160
 What?

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.160
 I was reading an article about a guinea pig show winner,

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.160
 whose a person who owns lots of winning guinea pigs.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.160
 He's called Tony Tankock.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:10.160
 Tony?

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.160
 Yeah, Tony Tankock.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.160
 Tony Tankock, yeah.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:19.160
 That is one thing. He's also the new sunbathing champion of Britain.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:24.160
 So he's got more than 50 guinea pigs,

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:29.160
 but he had six show guinea pigs stolen before a show recently, outrageous.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:33.160
 And he thinks it's just for rivalry because actually even the best show guinea pigs,

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:36.160
 the most valuable, the ones who've won the most competitions,

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.160
 chain tanks for about £30 each.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.160
 [laughter]

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:50.160
 OK, it's time for fact number two and that is Andy.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.160
 My fact is that Britain has a special team of leak detectives

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.160
 who listen to the sound of water using a special stick.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.160
 I've seen it. I've seen it happen near my house.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:04.160
 Have you? Yeah. I was walking with my son and there were these two guys standing in the middle of the road

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.160
 and one was leaning into a stick.

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:09.160
 It looks like a very long upside down plunger.

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:13.160
 So he had his head sort of in this rubbery thing and he said no.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:16.160
 And then he looked at the stick up and he moved about a meter down.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.160
 He went, there it is.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:20.160
 And I didn't know what the hell they were doing, so I just took my son away from it.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.160
 [laughter]

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:26.160
 So he was just plunging his ears, trying to get some wet hair out of his brain.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.160
 [laughter]

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:33.160
 They were, they were using a Victorian device, which is still used today to spot leaks and underground pipes.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:37.160
 It's obviously very hard to spot leaks because they're underground pipes.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:42.160
 But they do, the pipes do, the sticks vibrate when a leak is detected.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.160
 And they're often used at night because it means that there's less traffic around.

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.160
 So it's easier to detect a stick.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:52.160
 Is it like acoustic vibrations from the sound of the leak coming out of the thing?

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.160
 Okay, so that vibrates the stick.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:58.160
 And do they introduce themselves sort of a parties, do they just say I'm a detective and you put it that?

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.160
 [laughter]

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:03.160
 And then it really rebounds, oh thank god my husband's missing.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.160
 [laughter]

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.160
 Let me fetch my stick.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:12.160
 Apparently it's like all these pipes make some kind of noise.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:17.160
 But the gurgle of water going through a pipe is slightly different if there's a hole in it.

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.160
 [laughter]

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:20.160
 I can believe that.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:24.160
 So they, yeah, they, they, they just must know the sound really well.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:28.160
 And it seems to work really well because in a 12 month period from an article I read,

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.160
 they've managed to find 18,000 leaks using this stick.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.160
 Wow.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.160
 Yeah.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.160
 And it's extremely necessary.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:37.160
 So leaks are a massive water problem in this country.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:41.160
 We have more than 3 billion litres of water leaks per year.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:47.160
 Tim's water, which is the biggest water provider, has 20,500 litres escaping every day per kilometre.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:48.160
 Escaping.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:49.160
 So yeah, getting out.

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:50.160
 They want to be free.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.160
 And it's treated water, isn't it?

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.160
 Is water that should be good enough to come out of the tap?

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.160
 Absolutely.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:59.160
 And the one fifth of the water that's been treated that we're supposed to be drinking or using in our homes,

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.160
 one fifth of it leaks away every year.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.160
 I mean, it's terrible.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:03.160
 It's so wasteful.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.160
 That's a lot.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:08.160
 There is one way of finding leaks that's not the acoustic sticks.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.160
 Well.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:10.160
 But it's sniffer dogs.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:11.160
 So they've recently been employed.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.160
 And I think Scotland is the first place to employ them.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:19.160
 There are two coca-spaniels named Snipe and Denzel, who again, I think is strong.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.160
 There's really strong.

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.160
 They feel like they've been seconded over from the murder squad.

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:26.160
 I don't think the water dog should be called Snipe and Denzel.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:27.160
 I know.

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.160
 I feel sorry for them.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.160
 They should be called Puddle and Splash or something.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:33.160
 No, they are.

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:38.160
 And what's also sad about Snipe and Denzel is that they've been trained by these two soldiers

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:43.160
 who used to serve in Afghanistan and Iraq and did train sniffer dogs there.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:46.160
 And these two people now decided quite sweetly came back from Afghanistan and Iraq

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:51.160
 and decided to start training dogs to sniff out bedbugs and then to sniff out leaks.

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:52.160
 And so this is what they do.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:56.160
 And the way they do it is they are trained to detect tiny, tiny amounts of chlorine,

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.160
 because obviously our water is chlorinated.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.160
 And so they can tell.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.160
 Yeah, it's impressive, isn't it?

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:06.160
 So for companies, leakages in, say, even bathrooms, if you're a big company,

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:09.160
 and you have huge buildings, that results in huge amounts of money being lost.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:12.160
 So Pepsi, the article I was reading PepsiCo,

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:15.160
 worked out that the money that the person with being paid in that one building

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:19.160
 to be the leak detective, was the same amount of money roughly that they were saving

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:22.160
 in what they would have lost through bills.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.160
 Does that mean they might as well just fire them?

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.160
 Yeah.

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:27.160
 Well, I can't, yeah, it doesn't look cancel itself out.

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.160
 So you might as well just fire him.

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:30.160
 He's redundant.

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.160
 Well done, Den. Thanks very much.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.160
 That guy is going to listen to this.

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.160
 He walks out of the building.

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:39.160
 It must be that they saved way more than his people.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.160
 Yeah, it must be right.

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:43.160
 And you presented that as though it was going to be a positive thing.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.160
 I thought, weirdly, it was like, hire me, but it will be like,

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:50.160
 you're not wasting any money, you're just, you're a zero because you're not losing the money.

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:52.160
 I mean, you're bringing nothing to this company.

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:57.160
 That's like having someone, it's like Pepsi hiring someone to make a kind of Pepsi,

00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:03.160
 but it costs them like 70p to hire this guy and sell it for 70p.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:04.160
 What's the point of that?

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.160
 This is the actual sentence in the article.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:09.160
 The employee there had convinced his boss that saving water

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:12.160
 would also save enough money to pay for the employee's time,

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.160
 spent tracking and repairing leaks.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.160
 He must do some other stuff.

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.160
 Maybe he also works in IT.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:19.160
 That's possible.

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:23.160
 Maybe the leak is bad enough that there's water leaking and gushing all the way through the building.

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:28.160
 And so actually, you're preventing that as well as saving the coffee for the water.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.160
 Damn, in the rooms not being used.

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.160
 So at least it cancels out just on them.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.160
 See, it did make sense.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:36.160
 Well, I think by enough, I think that might have been a misquerid.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:39.160
 And he means you'll save more than that.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.160
 Yeah, more than enough.

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:44.160
 More than enough.

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:50.160
 One group of not people, but things that are good at looking for leaks is beavers.

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:53.160
 Because beavers make dams, as we all know.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:56.160
 And they will always plug any leaks in their dams,

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:59.160
 because it's really important that they have lots of water behind them,

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:01.160
 because they use the water to hide in.

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.160
 And so if they get a tiny little hole,

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.160
 then they'll immediately put sticks and stuff in.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.160
 But humans don't really like dams.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:12.160
 And so we'll often put little tubes in there to try and let the water go through the dams.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:15.160
 And then the beavers will kind of plug it up.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:23.160
 And so, anyway, so they've invented this thing called a beaver deceiver.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:28.160
 And the beaver deceiver is like, it's almost like a triangular pipe that goes in.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:32.160
 So it means that the flow happens way away from the dam.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:36.160
 And so where the flow goes in, it's not enough of a flow for the beaver to recognize it.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:40.160
 So you can't tell that there's a hole in there, even though there is a hole.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.160
 That's really clever isn't it really?

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:44.160
 So that beaver goes and sees the front of his dam.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.160
 And it doesn't look like there's a hole anywhere in it.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.160
 Yeah, if you put a hole right in a dam,

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.160
 then there'll be a flow of water and the beaver will recognize it.

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.160
 But if you put the beaver deceiver in,

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:57.160
 then the flow of water is coming from quite a long way away from the dam itself.

00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:00.160
 And it's much wider there, so the flow is much less.

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.160
 It's more subtle.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:03.160
 It's been sort of dissipated.

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:07.160
 I'll be honest, it's mostly about the name that I brought to you.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:15.160
 Okay, it is time for fact number three.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.160
 And that is my fact.

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:22.160
 My fact this week is that Japan's cybersecurity minister has never used a computer.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.160
 He's unhackable.

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.160
 He's unhackable.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.160
 Yeah, absolutely true.

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:30.160
 Yeah, his name is Yoshitaka Sakurada.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:36.160
 He's 68 years old, and he was made the deputy chief of the government's cybersecurity strategy office.

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:42.160
 He also is looking over as the minister for the Olympic and Paralympic Committee for the 2020 Games.

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:45.160
 He's never thrown a javelin either.

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:47.160
 The guy is so unqualified.

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:50.160
 But he was in a parliamentary committee meeting,

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:55.160
 and it was during there just after he'd be given the post of cybersecurity minister that he said that he had never used.

00:21:55.160 --> 00:22:01.160
 A computer before also seemed quite confused when a USB was brought up, not quite knowing what that was.

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:04.160
 So yeah, pretty astonishing that this guy has been given the post.

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:09.160
 And it's been a bit embarrassing for the prime minister because he was the one who gave him the post.

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:15.160
 And in fact, two days later, Sakurada actually tried to contradict that statement and said,

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:17.160
 "Of course I have used a computer.

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.160
 I just don't use it at home is what I was saying.

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:22.160
 I use it in the office, but no one really."

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:29.160
 But he's known for his gaps as well. He's not someone who's particularly good in these parliamentary committee meetings.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:36.160
 He claimed that the Olympics would cost Japan 1,500 yen instead of 150 billion yen.

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:43.160
 So 1,500 yen would work out at about 13 dollars for the Olympics.

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:45.160
 It would be a bargain, wouldn't it?

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.160
 If you could do it for that much.

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:52.160
 Well if the Olympics bring in as much money as they cost.

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.160
 Yeah, a bit like that guy at Pepsi.

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:56.160
 Yeah, you may as well just not have the Olympics.

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:59.160
 It's a problem solved.

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:05.160
 When he did say this about not using computers, there was a lot of people online who were taking the mic out of him.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:10.160
 But someone did say you don't need to know how to drive a tractor to be a good agriculture minister,

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:13.160
 which I think is almost a good point.

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:21.160
 As in the ministry, if you're a minister of something, you're tending to oversee things rather than actually using them.

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:26.160
 Absolutely, although that's quite a slightly controversial thing, people sometimes object to anyway,

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:31.160
 that the person who is most senior in charge of various ministries like foreign affairs or defence,

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.160
 whatever, never knows what they're doing.

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:36.160
 But politicians in general don't ask democracy for you.

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:43.160
 If you want to have some kind of system where clever people are in charge, then that's enough.

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.160
 Good luck to you.

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.160
 But it's always weird.

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:49.160
 So I was reading, I was looking into unqualified ministers generally.

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:54.160
 But then I did think government ministers who had suddenly shifted to transport even though they don't even know what a bus looks like,

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:56.160
 is quite strange.

00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:02.160
 And I went into your Margaret Beckett in 2006 when she was suddenly shifted to be foreign secretary.

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:06.160
 And I think she'd been environment before or agriculture before that.

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:09.160
 And she openly said, "I'm completely flying by the seat of my pants."

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:12.160
 And she was appointed on Friday evening.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:15.160
 And she had to swap up over the weekend Monday morning.

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:18.160
 She's just flown to discuss Iran negotiations with Condoleezza Rice.

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:21.160
 And that's a baptism of fire.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.160
 You don't get that in most jobs.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.160
 Yeah, this is weird.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.160
 I'm reading a book kind of about this at the moment.

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:26.160
 I'm Michael Lewis.

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:27.160
 Yeah, it's called the fifth risk.

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:31.160
 And it's all about project management and how you fill roles.

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:33.160
 He's writing about the Department of Energy.

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:37.160
 And the guy who got the job had previously said he wanted to shut the Department of Energy down.

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:40.160
 Or he said he couldn't even remember which department he wanted to shut down.

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.160
 Yeah.

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:42.160
 Rick Perry.

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:43.160
 Oh, yeah, Rick Perry.

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:44.160
 Yeah.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.160
 And then he was given the job.

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:48.160
 So I think some level of knowledge is probably good.

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.160
 But there is an argument, isn't there?

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.160
 I mean, this is a bit technical and probably boring.

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:57.160
 But there is an argument that you should just have people in charge who know what they're doing.

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.160
 But the argument against that.

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:01.160
 What a ridiculous argument.

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:08.160
 I think it's like what we found that democracy is better where everyone gets a vote even though people don't really understand what they're voting for.

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:11.160
 And that means that everyone is kind of invested in it.

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:15.160
 And so even if you make a bad decision, at least everyone's invested in that bad decision.

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:19.160
 Whereas if you promote people who are supposed to be just good at things,

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:24.160
 number one, who decides who's good at stuff, but number two, no one else is invested in that.

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:30.160
 So if things go wrong, which they always do, then that's when you chop people's heads up.

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:31.160
 That's fine.

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:34.160
 I'd rather chop one person's head off than us all have to go down together taking the blame.

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.160
 For me, anti-democratic.

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:38.160
 I'm not saying one's better than the other, but you know.

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:40.160
 I like experts and autocracy.

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.160
 So I'm just going to flag it up.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:47.160
 So on Japanese computing stuff, the Japanese government is currently engaged.

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:52.160
 It's just beginning a massive exercise to hack 200 million objects.

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:58.160
 And they're quite worried about cybersecurity and about the Internet of Things.

00:25:58.160 --> 00:25:59.160
 You know what I'm saying?

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:01.160
 I just think he's meant to be hacking things.

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:04.160
 He's sitting there with a manual, a huge hacker's manual.

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:09.160
 No, this guy is probably, he thinks that he's hacking just 20 things.

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:16.160
 And so they're doing a five-year experiment hacking into Internet of Things.

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:18.160
 They've just got legal permission to do it.

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:21.160
 Because obviously it's like a conversation.

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:24.160
 So you're talking about like smart things in houses.

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:25.160
 Exactly, yeah.

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:28.160
 Also, you'll just have a government minister suddenly talking through your fridge to you or something.

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:29.160
 Why do you do that?

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:30.160
 I mean, sort of.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:36.160
 It's a test security because they're very worried about, you know, the chaos that can be caused by hacking into things.

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:41.160
 And you know, people don't have web-enabled yoga mats.

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:42.160
 Yeah, really?

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.160
 Yeah.

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:45.160
 And they've all got factory settings.

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:48.160
 But it's always zero, zero, zero, zero, or whatever.

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:50.160
 What's a yoga mat doing to you that needs a smart?

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:52.160
 I thought, I mean, it's just a rug, isn't it?

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:55.160
 It's going to say to you, you're putting too much pressure on your left wrist.

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:59.160
 So you need to change your, you know, the way that you're dogging.

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:03.160
 You're being a bit self-righteous and tedious about your yoga.

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:06.160
 Stop boring all your friends.

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:13.160
 No, Singapore did a very similar thing, I think, which is, I think this is a couple of years ago,

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:17.160
 hundreds of hackers were invited by the government to try and hack into its defense ministry.

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.160
 And so, and they offered their rewards.

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:22.160
 So they basically said everyone tried to crack into our security systems.

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:28.160
 And they distributed $15,000 price money between all these hackers who successfully said,

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:31.160
 "Yeah, I've just hacked in here and found out the planning to bomb Russia tomorrow."

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:32.160
 Singapore.

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:33.160
 Singapore.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:34.160
 Yeah, I know.

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.160
 Very surprising.

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:40.160
 Do you know that if you connect to someone else's Wi-Fi hotspot is Singapore without the permission,

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.160
 you can get three years in prison?

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.160
 Wow.

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:44.160
 Really?

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.160
 Did not know that.

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:50.160
 I think the whole hacking thing though, I mean, in Japan particularly, I guess it is a bit of a worrying problem

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:55.160
 because, let's say Tokyo, they're just really implementing the idea of robots running a lot of things.

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:57.160
 That's got to be a huge problem.

00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:01.160
 So for example, a robot last year ran for election in Japan.

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:03.160
 And it got 4,000 votes.

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.160
 It came third in the election.

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:07.160
 I think these things are never as far along as the makers claim.

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:08.160
 No, robots still rubbish.

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:09.160
 It came third.

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:10.160
 It came third.

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.160
 Japan, actually.

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:14.160
 That says more about the people voting for it than the robot now.

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:15.160
 That's true.

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:17.160
 I mean, America just elected a puppet.

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:18.160
 Whoa!

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.160
 Puppet.

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.160
 Yes.

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.160
 Yeah.

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:25.160
 Japan is actually not that advanced in computers.

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.160
 Well, I think we must have mentioned before.

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:33.160
 But in Japan, computers aren't the norm for a lot of people in the same way that they are in the Western world.

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:35.160
 So fax is still a very big thing in Japan.

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:36.160
 It's really, really common.

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:40.160
 You wouldn't send an email naturally if you were sort of booking a restaurant or something.

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:44.160
 Or there was a journalist who went and she wanted an interview with, I think, a government minister.

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:47.160
 And they said, you can't email us to book an interview or use any computers.

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:48.160
 You have to do it by fax.

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:49.160
 Yeah.

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:51.160
 If you RSVPing, it's all by fax machine.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:57.160
 So I don't think it's maybe as big a deal for this guy to have said he's never used a computer,

00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:59.160
 because it's maybe not as much the norm in your day-to-day life.

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:00.160
 That's a top-send.

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:02.160
 And it's all smart phones, basically.

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:09.160
 Do you think there's, like, a Japanese podcast saying that the head of digital security in the UK has never used a fax machine?

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:11.160
 [laughter]

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:15.160
 Actually, speaking of that, there's only one MP.

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:18.160
 This is in 2016. There's been an election since, but I think it's still true.

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:23.160
 There's only one MP who doesn't accept emails from constituents.

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:26.160
 And you have to send them a fax instead.

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.160
 Or a letter.

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:29.160
 And that is Dr. Julian Lewis.

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:32.160
 Oh, he's one of the big brecks here, guys.

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:33.160
 Yes, yeah.

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:34.160
 And they found this out.

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:40.160
 There was someone called the family Nixon, who worked for a company called Right to Them.

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:43.160
 And this is a website that lets you get in touch with your MP.

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:45.160
 And they found out that the fax machine had broken.

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:48.160
 And they tried to work out whether they had to buy a new one or not.

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:53.160
 And they realized that there was only one MP in the whole country that they needed a fax machine for.

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:55.160
 And it was this Julian Lewis guy.

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.160
 Really?

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:57.160
 Absolutely.

00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:00.160
 The FBI is very into faxing still.

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:08.160
 In fact, the FBI in 2017 said it will no longer accept freedom of information requests by email.

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:10.160
 It's only accepting them by fax again.

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:11.160
 Wow.

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:13.160
 So that you can either fax or use snail mail.

00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:15.160
 Is that just so that people can't be bothered?

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:18.160
 I think it's to make it a bit more difficult, yeah.

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:25.160
 This is a big thing in America as in technological illiteracy by, you know, senators or congresspeople.

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:30.160
 So when Mark Zuckerberg appeared in front of senators to answer all these questions about Facebook,

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:36.160
 he was asked questions, including, is Twitter the same as what you do?

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:43.160
 And if I'm emailing within WhatsApp, does that inform your advertisers?

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:45.160
 What was face mash?

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:47.160
 Is it still up and running?

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:49.160
 I don't know what face mash was.

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:53.160
 Face mash was his very first site where, yeah, it was grading.

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:55.160
 I know, yeah, I remember that.

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:58.160
 Oh, I thought it was the thing where you combine your face with someone else's face.

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:00.160
 That's what I thought when you said be like a baby.

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.160
 No.

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:02.160
 What?

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:05.160
 Like if you had a kid and you combined your heads and you told you what you'll.

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:07.160
 Kid would look like, okay.

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:08.160
 Yeah, maybe.

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:09.160
 Maybe I'm wrong about face mash.

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:10.160
 See, I don't know.

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:11.160
 Maybe I'm wrong.

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:12.160
 Maybe I thought that was his first thing.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:16.160
 Well, I think we've established it's a totally justified relationship.

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:18.160
 And well done for asking.

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:23.160
 That's so good, though. It's like he's basically been called round to his grandparents place.

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:27.160
 There are a thousand grandparents there.

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:35.160
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show.

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:37.160
 And that is Chazinski.

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:42.160
 My fact this week is that a Mumbai businessman is trying to sue his parents for giving birth to him.

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:45.160
 And his mother has responded by saying,

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:50.160
 if she'd met him before he was born, she definitely wouldn't have done it.

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:56.160
 So this is this guy from Mumbai and he said his parents gave birth to him without his consent.

00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:58.160
 And you shouldn't be allowed to do that.

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:01.160
 It's wrong to bring children into the world without their consent.

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:05.160
 They're destined to a life of constant suffering that they didn't choose.

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:07.160
 And so he's suing his parents.

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:12.160
 And the thing is going to make it a bit harder for him is that both his parents are lawyers.

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:20.160
 So I had one other thing his mother said, which is if he could come up with a rational explanation as to how we could have sought his consent to be born, I will accept my fault.

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:22.160
 Yeah, that's fair enough.

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:26.160
 So this is anti-natalism, which I had never heard of up until this.

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:28.160
 Well, it's quite a new concept.

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:30.160
 Yeah, it's an amazing concept, though, isn't it?

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:33.160
 It's just the idea that why are we alive at all?

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:36.160
 We should just stop having babies, but we shouldn't be upset about that.

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:39.160
 We should be thinking of we're doing the universal favour.

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:41.160
 Why? Sorry.

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:44.160
 They just think we're born into suffering that we're born into.

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:50.160
 If you know that you've got certain diseases in your family that you know might genetically go down, that's a bit different.

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:51.160
 That is just like everything.

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:53.160
 Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of reasons as well.

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:57.160
 One reason is overpopulation, which is always a thing that people can't pay for.

00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:01.160
 But the other thing is like by bringing in birth, it means that you're bringing in death.

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:06.160
 So it guarantees that whoever is alive, there is going to be some kind of suffering for them.

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:08.160
 Yeah, I guess so.

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:12.160
 And it's the idea, basically, that by having someone give birth, you add something negative.

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:17.160
 He says it's wrong to bring children into the world because even he admits my life is proportionately very good.

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:20.160
 It's absolutely fine, I'm perfectly happy, but I'd rather not be here.

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:23.160
 It's like there's a nice room, but I don't really want to be in that room.

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:25.160
 We'll piss off her.

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:28.160
 No, no, you can't say that.

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:34.160
 Guy falls dying, and then he says, "Well, it's really unfair to have locked me with the decision of whether or not I kill myself."

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:40.160
 And this actually comes from this guy who had a similarly low bar for what equal suffering.

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:44.160
 So it's this guy called David Benatar, who wrote a book called Better To Have Never Been.

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:46.160
 And that was, I think, about...

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:48.160
 It should have been written in the book, should it?

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:50.160
 He really regrets it.

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:52.160
 It should have never been written in the book.

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:56.160
 It's the best seller buy, really, which is probably up there.

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.160
 So he's a really fun guy.

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:03.160
 And he says that we're almost always hungry or thirsty.

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:05.160
 When we're not, we always have to go to the bathroom.

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:07.160
 We're always experiencing it.

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:09.160
 I think it's going to touch us.

00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:14.160
 I'm capable of going an hour or time without eating or drinking or going to the bathroom.

00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:16.160
 And I don't think I'm special, I should say.

00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:19.160
 Would you not say you're always a bit hungry or thirsty?

00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:20.160
 No.

00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:21.160
 Or if not, he says...

00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:22.160
 Are you not a bad thing, though?

00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:24.160
 I'm a bit thirsty, yeah.

00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:28.160
 Oh no, I should never have been born.

00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:34.160
 Or if that, he says, and this is something that you can't deny Andy, he says...

00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:36.160
 We're always experiencing thermal discomfort.

00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:38.160
 We're always a bit too hot or a bit too cold.

00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:40.160
 You literally just tell me to turn the heating down.

00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:41.160
 That's true.

00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:43.160
 Okay, I'm in.

00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:44.160
 Or too tired.

00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:50.160
 I'm not tired, but that's any because we're recording at about 10 to 1 in the afternoon.

00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:54.160
 You said it's quite new, but this idea has been around for quite a long time.

00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:57.160
 Not the name, anti-natalism, but other stuff.

00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:04.160
 So the Enchrotites, which were an old sex, they said that in order to conquer death,

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:07.160
 people should desist from procreation.

00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:11.160
 The Manichains, the Boga Mills, the Cathars, they all thought that kind of thing.

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:14.160
 But obviously not any of them really around now.

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:16.160
 And that's kind of the problem with this.

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:20.160
 If it's your doctrine, then you don't really send it down to your children or your children.

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:21.160
 All or nothing, isn't it?

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:24.160
 Unless you can persuade everyone, your idea is not going to be the one that survives.

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:29.160
 So there's a group called the voluntary human extinction movement, which set up in 1991.

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:31.160
 Until 1992.

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:34.160
 And that was a guy called Les Knight, who founded it.

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:37.160
 And it just asks people not to have children, basically.

00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:39.160
 And he said, "I consider it a success.

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:42.160
 Every time one more of us decides not to add one more of us."

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:45.160
 It needs to be the enforced human extinction movement, doesn't it?

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:47.160
 It's not going to work in this country.

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:50.160
 Yeah, actually it's that guy from Avengers, isn't it?

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:51.160
 It's the same idea.

00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:53.160
 What's he called from the latest Avengers?

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:54.160
 Thanos.

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:56.160
 Yeah, Thanos, spoiler alert, if you haven't seen it.

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.160
 But you really should have done.

00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:02.160
 But at the end of it, he kind of kills half of all beings in the universe.

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.160
 Wow.

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:04.160
 They just disappear.

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:06.160
 And the idea is there's overpopulation.

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.160
 And he thinks that, you know, that's the best way of doing it.

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:10.160
 And it's completely random in the Avengers.

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:13.160
 So all at once you just start to disappear half of the people.

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:14.160
 Wow.

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:15.160
 I think warn people.

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:17.160
 There's no reason not to warn people.

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:19.160
 Well, they knew because the Avengers were fighting against it.

00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:22.160
 So they kind of knew that this guy was going to do something.

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:25.160
 But you should have time to set your affairs in order and feed the cat.

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:27.160
 And the event that the cat survives.

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:28.160
 Is the cat saying?

00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:29.160
 That's generally what you're saying.

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:32.160
 Well, if you've got two cats, you should put out one lot of food basically.

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:36.160
 Well, you don't know because your two might both survive when they might both die.

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:40.160
 And the other thing is if you're the one who disappears, but your cat doesn't,

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:42.160
 then the cat's going to starve to death.

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:45.160
 So actually, it's going to be more than half of the universe.

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:48.160
 Some people are reliant on others.

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:53.160
 Cats aren't reliant on us.

00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:54.160
 The dogs will die.

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:55.160
 Sure.

00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:57.160
 I do find it an amazing concept.

00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:58.160
 I'm definitely.

00:36:58.160 --> 00:36:59.160
 The Avengers, yeah.

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:00.160
 Yeah.

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:02.160
 Right down the name of that title.

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:06.160
 But no, the idea of, you know, should we go on?

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:08.160
 I'm on the side that we should.

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:09.160
 I've proved that.

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:10.160
 I've just had a baby.

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:11.160
 I've proved it.

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:12.160
 I've got proof that I think that.

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:14.160
 But I do, you do kind of go, well, why are we going?

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:15.160
 What are we going on for?

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:17.160
 I can see that their side of it is sort of going,

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:21.160
 what if we've actually woken up to the idea that there's all this suffering going on?

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:24.160
 And our job is to be clever enough to end it completely.

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:25.160
 Yeah.

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:26.160
 The life is a mistake.

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:28.160
 It's if we haven't seen it anywhere else.

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:30.160
 Yeah, but there's just such a big concept.

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:32.160
 I think the planet has got resources to give a town of, say,

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:34.160
 20,000 people a really good time.

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:37.160
 You know, but I guess if you just keep those 20,000 people alive,

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:38.160
 we'll just have a vote.

00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:39.160
 Or we'll have a random ballot.

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:41.160
 And we'll just say, you 20,000, you get to survive.

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:42.160
 And you're going to have a great time.

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:44.160
 You would love it if there weren't that many.

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.160
 You would have loved it in the Stone Age.

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:49.160
 In the Stone Age, they've recently done a study at the start, the Stone Age,

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:53.160
 that in the whole of Europe, there are about 1,500 people.

00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:54.160
 Lovely.

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:56.160
 We just about the same number has come to one of our shows.

00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:58.160
 But that's over the whole of Europe.

00:37:58.160 --> 00:37:59.160
 Yeah, that's crazy.

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:00.160
 That's crazy.

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:02.160
 Travel and parking will be a nightmare for that show, wouldn't it?

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:05.160
 If everyone from Europe was coming to it.

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:07.160
 Yes, but parking in the rest of Europe would be quite good.

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:08.160
 Oh, yeah.

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:11.160
 If you were the one person that didn't want to go to the show,

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:14.160
 it would be bliss, wouldn't it?

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:16.160
 Pros are empty.

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:17.160
 It is interesting.

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:19.160
 And you having a child doesn't actually prove

00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:21.160
 that you don't believe in this.

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:22.160
 It just means you're a hypocrite.

00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:24.160
 Just means you're shit at contraception.

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:27.160
 No, it's not me, guys.

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:29.160
 I messed up big time.

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:31.160
 Yeah, I mean, a lot of us do things

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:33.160
 that we wouldn't say morally what we believe in.

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:34.160
 Right.

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:36.160
 In fact, the guy Benatar, who's sort of come up with...

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:37.160
 It's got 50 kids.

00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:41.160
 He won't admit.

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:43.160
 He won't tell journalists that New York interviewed him and said,

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:44.160
 "Do you have children yourself?"

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:45.160
 And he said, "I'd rather not answer that.

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:47.160
 I don't see how it's relevant to my argument."

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:48.160
 Really?

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:52.160
 There's only evidence that he hadn't quite believed it at, you know,

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:54.160
 nine months before the time of the birth of his child.

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:56.160
 So he might have changed his mind now.

00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:57.160
 He might have changed his mind.

00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:58.160
 That's a really good point.

00:38:58.160 --> 00:38:59.160
 After he met the kid.

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:02.160
 That was a one thing that changed his mind.

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:05.160
 This one by businessman thinks he should never have been born as worse

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:08.160
 if your parents become anti-natalists after your born.

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:11.160
 As you just say, a lot of these facts we were mentioning

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:14.160
 came from this brilliant article in the New Yorker.

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:15.160
 It's called "The History of Blood"

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:17.160
 and would definitely recommend reading it.

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:19.160
 Just on weird lawsuits.

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:20.160
 Yeah.

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:23.160
 I didn't know about this lawsuit in the 19th century.

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:26.160
 So in 1893, where the Supreme Court got involved

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:29.160
 in whether tomato was a fruit or a vegetable.

00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:30.160
 Why?

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:31.160
 Why did they do this?

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:33.160
 So the ruling is actually in.

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:36.160
 And it was a lawsuit that was brought by the next family

00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:38.160
 so they were big sellers of tomatoes.

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:40.160
 And it was against this guy called Edward Heden.

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:43.160
 And it was to recover some fees they'd spent.

00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:46.160
 There's some tax they'd paid on exporting some tomatoes.

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:50.160
 Because there was a rule that tax had to be paid on imported vegetables

00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:51.160
 but not on fruit.

00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:55.160
 And then they were like, well, tomato is technically a fruit.

00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:56.160
 So we shouldn't have to pay tax on that.

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.160
 Went to court.

00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:59.160
 And everyone got their dictionaries out in court

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:01.160
 and brought up different definitions of fruits and vegetables.

00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:04.160
 And it was ruled that tomato is a vegetable.

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:07.160
 According to the Supreme Court, you had to pay tax on it

00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:10.160
 because everyone sort of thinks of it as a vegetable.

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:12.160
 I don't think it is though.

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:14.160
 Well, it's not botanically, but they said that's not relevant

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:15.160
 for tax purposes.

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:18.160
 I remember reading that I think by law in the EU,

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:20.160
 a carrot is a fruit.

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:21.160
 It is.

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:24.160
 A carrot is a carrot, a cucumber, sweet potato.

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:27.160
 It's because in Portugal, they make jam out of it.

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:28.160
 Yeah.

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:31.160
 And so jam has different fruit, if you're fruit jam,

00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:33.160
 then you've got certain tax rules that apply to you.

00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:34.160
 And so it's got to make sure.

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:36.160
 And there's a thing a directive that says,

00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:39.160
 for these purposes, carrots, cucumbers, sweet potatoes are all fruits.

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:40.160
 Wow.

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:41.160
 And that's why we're leaving.

00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:42.160
 So you can make a really--

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:45.160
 [LAUGHTER]

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:48.160
 There was a guy in 2006 called Alan Heckard

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:52.160
 who tried to sue Michael Jordan for $416 million

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:55.160
 on the grounds that he looked like him.

00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:59.160
 And this guy said that it was ruining his life.

00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:00.160
 He couldn't go to church.

00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:01.160
 He couldn't go to the shops.

00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:03.160
 He couldn't eat out without being mistaken

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:04.160
 for Michael Jordan.

00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:05.160
 People were coming out with him.

00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:07.160
 So he actually-- so he paid the fee.

00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:08.160
 This is the weird thing.

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:10.160
 You pay a fee to file this lawsuit.

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:11.160
 It's like $200.

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:14.160
 And he also sued Nike for the same amount,

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:16.160
 because it was their responsibility as well

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:18.160
 for making Jordan famous.

00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:20.160
 And weirdly, though, I've looked at pictures.

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:23.160
 And basically, the similarities are that he's bald

00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:24.160
 like Michael Jordan.

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:26.160
 He has an earring and exactly the same ear,

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:27.160
 which I suppose he could have removed.

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:28.160
 He's exactly the same ear.

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:30.160
 [LAUGHTER]

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:33.160
 And he wears a Jordan shoes.

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:35.160
 [LAUGHTER]

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:37.160
 And always a basketball jersey

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:38.160
 with the name Jordan.

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:41.160
 [LAUGHTER]

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:42.160
 Wow.

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:43.160
 He lost, right?

00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:44.160
 No, he won.

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:45.160
 Yeah, a billion dollars.

00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:48.160
 [LAUGHTER]

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:49.160
 Yeah, he did not win.

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:54.160
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:55.160
 OK, that's it.

00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:56.160
 That is all of our facts.
