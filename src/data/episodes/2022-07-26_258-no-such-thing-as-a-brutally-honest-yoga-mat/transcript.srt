00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:18,940
 Hello and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.

3
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:24,940
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here next to James Harkin, who is sitting next to Andrew Hunter Murray,

4
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:38,420
 and then rounding off the circle in between Andrew and myself is Anarch Zinsky, and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

5
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:42,760
 Starting with you, the man sitting next to me, James Harkin.

6
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:49,720
 And if at home you can work out because there's only one man sat next to Dan, if you remember the situation of us all around the table.

7
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,360
 Genius.

8
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,480
 So who's it? Me.

9
00:00:51,480 --> 00:01:01,980
 Yeah, sorry. My fact this week is that animal metabolism was first proven by Antoine Lavoisier in an experiment where he put a guinea pig in a freezer.

10
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:08,100
 Okay, so a couple of caveats to this, freezers haven't been invented yet.

11
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,100
 [laughter]

12
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,100
 It's the first time.

13
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:18,700
 So it was in an ice calorimeter, which is a container inside another container, which is full of ice.

14
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,440
 So it's a way that people would keep things cool in those days, but it's not a freezer per se, I wouldn't say.

15
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,960
 It's kind of like a thermos flask, but it's got ice instead of a vacuum.

16
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,560
 Yes.

17
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,960
 Okay, yeah, that's fair enough.

18
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:38,560
 But it was important that it was ice rather than a vacuum because it was the amount of ice that melted, which he measured, and that worked out how much heat was given off by the guinea pig.

19
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,160
 And it was heat just from living from the guinea pig, and he realized that this was a kind of metabolism.

20
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:55,520
 Which is a bit like combustion, so combustion is where you burn organic material to get energy, and metabolism is where you kind of burn sugars to get energy for the body, and he worked out that these two were kind of the same thing.

21
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,840
 Mmm.

22
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,400
 And I thought he'd sort of invented the device.

23
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,640
 Or was it there anyway?

24
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,640
 I don't know about that.

25
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:11,600
 The way I heard it describe, which is quite good, to visualise, is like one of those water coolers in an office, but so it had the guinea pig in the middle, and then it had another water cooler around it with the ice,

26
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,840
 and then it had another water cooler around it with snow, didn't it, because he had to insulate the ice.

27
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,080
 I don't know where he was getting used to amounts of snow, so he stuffed the outside with snow, so the ice didn't melt for other reasons.

28
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,600
 It's amazing, guys, though. Like, I wouldn't be surprised if he did invent that, because the guy invented so much.

29
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:34,640
 I mean, he's a bit new to me, I have to say, but, you know, he created oxygen, and thank God for him, because before that, it was really hard to create.

30
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,240
 He created carbon dioxide, like we all do.

31
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,240
 Oh, yeah, he created that, but then he found the word oxygen.

32
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,080
 Yeah, he coined, yeah.

33
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:55,360
 Because he, so obviously, priestly is the person that most people associate with oxygen, because priestly worked out that this weird thing was happening during combustion, and so he went to Lavoisier, and said, hey, look at this, and it was Lavoisier, who kind of explained it.

34
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:03,200
 But I think priestly didn't think it was oxygen that was being generated. He thought it was deflogisticated air.

35
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:13,600
 That is. So the idea was that there was a substance called flogistone, which was in lots and lots of materials, and it really wanted to burn. So once you burn something, it was released.

36
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:20,960
 So basically, as soon as you burn something, the flogistone was released, and then you just had, well, oxygen left over, but he just thought it was deflogisticated air.

37
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:29,200
 And I think for the next 30 years of his life, he refused to believe Lavoisier's rival and correct interpretation of what oxygen was, and continued to call it deflogisticated air.

38
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:38,880
 In fairness, they're pretty much the same thing, but just with one of them a way worse name. The weird thing is, he did all of this stuff on his day off, which is so cool.

39
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:48,200
 So he was a taxman, really. He had a vast tax organisation, it was Paris's chief taxman, basically. And he worked six hours, he worked six hours every week.

40
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,960
 No, he worked six days a week.

41
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:59,160
 For 20 years, he worked six days a week, and he did all his science, his experiments on one day a week, and he did a little bit of work in the mornings.

42
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:13,160
 And that actually led to his death partly, his job as a taxman, because he was guillotineed on trumped up charges of tax fraud, but really he'd been really unpopular since the time he suggested a wall around Paris.

43
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,600
 He suggested a seventh wall around Paris.

44
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,920
 I can't imagine why anyone would object to the political suggestion of a wall.

45
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:27,160
 He said it was to make the tax system fairer, and a lot of people said it's not that it's to squeeze the poor, and it got torn down in the revolution.

46
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:46,160
 As a tax collector, he was quite reformist, and I think a lot of people say that he probably wouldn't have been beheaded during the French Revolution, if it weren't for the fact that he really pissed off Marat, didn't he, who was notorious kind of quite bloodthirsty revolutionary, but who also fancied himself as a scientist.

47
00:04:46,160 --> 00:05:00,160
 So Marat wanted to get into the Academy of Sciences where Lavoisier was very influential. Marat believed in stuff like animal magnetism, which we've talked about before, and he said he could see things like magnetism and mesmerism leaking from objects.

48
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,160
 He said he saw it leaking from the head of Benjamin Franklin, for instance.

49
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:10,160
 So he applied to the Academy of Sciences with these theories, and Lavoisier said, "No, you can't come in. This sounds like nonsense to me."

50
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:16,160
 He held a grudge against him ever since, and it was him who said, "As soon as the opportunity arose, let's chop that guy's head off." He insulted me.

51
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,160
 He saw a lot of stuff leaking from Lavoisier's head.

52
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:33,160
 Actually, what happened was, in fact, this didn't happen, but there is a myth that Lavoisier asked one of his assistants, because he was a great scientist, to watch him as he had his head chopped off, and he was going to keep blinking and to see how long he blinked more after the chop off.

53
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,160
 That is so cool.

54
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,160
 Wait, but that didn't happen.

55
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:46,160
 That's a famous myth, isn't it? I didn't know that was to do with him. That's so cool. Just on his head, a century after he died, there was a statue that was erected of him up in Paris.

56
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,160
 But no one quite noticed at the time that it wasn't his head on the statue. They'd used the wrong head.

57
00:05:51,160 --> 00:06:03,160
 Basically, the guy who was sculpting it didn't have enough money, so he found a spare head, and it was the secretary of the Academy of Sciences, who was there during Lavoisier's last years, and they used his head instead on the thing.

58
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,160
 I think the idea was he was going to sculpt Lavoisier's head over it.

59
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:12,160
 When you said they used it said they obviously didn't plant his head on top of a statue. I mean, they used him as a model to sculpt his head.

60
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:18,160
 No, they used like an old statue head of it. Obviously, it wasn't like the first one going to his head.

61
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,160
 But not the actual, not an actual head.

62
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,160
 No, this is a century after he died.

63
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,160
 How many statues have actual heads on the top of them?

64
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:30,160
 You can tell with a statue, if the horse has got one leg off the ground, they die in battle.

65
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,160
 If it has the person's actual head, they die in a guillotine accident.

66
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,160
 They did some weird shit back there.

67
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,160
 Guillotine accident.

68
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,160
 Guillotine accident.

69
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,160
 I keep dropping this. I wasn't even meant to be used for that.

70
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:48,160
 It's really sad though, because he was exonerated a year and a half after his death.

71
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,160
 That's only 18 months for a rapid turnaround in his reputation, and he had a massive funeral.

72
00:06:52,160 --> 00:07:00,160
 3,000 people came, there was a hundred strong choir singing, and there was a bust of him, which was crowned with a reed and this huge tomb,

73
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,160
 all despite the fact that his body was headless and buried in a mass grave somewhere.

74
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,160
 Was the revolution?

75
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,160
 Yeah.

76
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,160
 When he was 28, he married this 13-year-old.

77
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:17,160
 And he put this girl to work translating scientific papers from different countries.

78
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,160
 And then basically, once he got all this stuff translated, he then magically discovered things.

79
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,160
 Oh, okay.

80
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,160
 She was awesome though.

81
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,160
 She was so cool.

82
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:34,160
 Yeah, Marianne, Pierreette, Paul's, and yeah, she was 13, but I think she liked him a lot and she married him to get away from marrying a 50-year-old.

83
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:42,160
 It was her father who effectively got them married to this 50-year-old count.

84
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,160
 Apparently, he used to come around their house and they'd play board games together.

85
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,160
 So it's a beautiful romance if you discount the 13-year-old thing.

86
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,160
 But she was scientifically very adept.

87
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,160
 It's thought on a lot of the stuff that he did and may have involved her, but she wouldn't have accredited.

88
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,160
 She did amazing scientific drawings and stuff.

89
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,160
 Yeah.

90
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:05,160
 You know there was one experiment he did where he kept a pelican full of water at boiling point for a hundred and a half days.

91
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,160
 What?

92
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,160
 A hundred and a hundred and one consecutive days.

93
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,160
 Well, it must have been dead after the first 20 minutes.

94
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,160
 Well, the thing you need to know about this is that a pelican is a kind of specialist water container.

95
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,160
 How did you guys go, though?

96
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:25,160
 I quite like the fact that he was able to sort of do the foundations of metabolism off this one experiment.

97
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:31,160
 Because people have been toying with it for a very long time and it must have really annoyed one guy in particular called Santoria Santoria.

98
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,160
 You read about him?

99
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:41,160
 He spent 30 years using a chair device to weigh himself and everything that he ate and drank as well as his urine and feces.

100
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:46,160
 And the idea was he was comparing the weight of what he'd eaten and that was coming out, the waste products.

101
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:54,160
 So the whole point was to work out the foundations of metabolism, but 30 years and he didn't really get to a final point of it.

102
00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:00,160
 All mate puts a guinea pig in a freezer and I don't think it would have been that pestle because he'd been dead for at least 150 years.

103
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,160
 Oh, yeah.

104
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,160
 I didn't look at the birth and death date.

105
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,160
 That's true.

106
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,160
 Cool.

107
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,160
 Actually, I feel better about that.

108
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:10,160
 If you were doing that experiment, you really wouldn't want to mix up the tray on which you weigh all your food.

109
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,160
 And then the tray on which you weigh all your pieces would you?

110
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,160
 You'd probably label them.

111
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,160
 Yeah.

112
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:24,160
 But the idea, is the logic presumably behind what he did was that he was trying to prove that what he ate weighed much more than what was coming out of it.

113
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,160
 Yes.

114
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,160
 And so it obviously was his theory proven to be correct.

115
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:35,160
 And the overarching theory of kind of existence as we have it now is that whatever goes in has to come out in some form.

116
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,160
 Like whatever matter goes in, that amount of matter has to come out.

117
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,160
 Yeah.

118
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,160
 So if it's not being pooed out, it's coming out somewhere else.

119
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,160
 Exactly.

120
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:48,160
 And he worked out that for every eight pounds of food he ate, he excreted only three pounds of feces.

121
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:55,160
 And he worked out that about half a pound of air was coming out of his mouth and various stuff coming out of different parts of his body.

122
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:00,160
 And this was all in his 1614 book, "Arse de Statica de Medicina."

123
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,160
 Arse.

124
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,160
 Arse.

125
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,160
 It's obviously art.

126
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,160
 Come on.

127
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,160
 That's Latin for art.

128
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,160
 Or work, I guess.

129
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,160
 Yeah.

130
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,160
 Did he, it was consistent for him?

131
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:16,160
 Did he, like, would he be up to dinner suddenly feel the need to poo and sort of have to dash off to the lab?

132
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,160
 So what makes me think, oh, you mean did he do it every single day?

133
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,160
 Yeah.

134
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,160
 I don't think people went out to restaurants in the same way.

135
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,160
 Did they?

136
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,160
 They haven't been invented at that time.

137
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,160
 Not really.

138
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,160
 Dinner party maybe then.

139
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,160
 Yeah.

140
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:32,160
 If you invite him over to dinner, maybe he brought his contraption with him.

141
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,160
 He just left his feces tray by the door.

142
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,160
 No dietary requirements.

143
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:42,160
 But I will need to weigh.

144
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:50,160
 So one of the things that's crucial to metabolism, which we all learned in GCSE biology is enzymes, huge deal, right?

145
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,160
 So enzymes are the thing that speeds up all metabolic processes.

146
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:00,160
 But I just always find it so amazing that these things would happen if enzymes didn't exist.

147
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,160
 So the enzymes are the proteins that sit there and they tell processes to happen.

148
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,160
 And they tell different molecules to pair up with each other and process things.

149
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,160
 And if they didn't exist, then things would happen much more slowly.

150
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:19,160
 So for instance, there's an enzyme called phosphatase, which is used for things like signaling between ourselves

151
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,160
 and like transmitting hormone impulses between us, totally necessary for life.

152
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:28,160
 And one little reaction involving phosphatase takes 10 milliseconds.

153
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,160
 Without that enzyme, it would take one trillion years.

154
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,160
 So you would still be able to eat and still pour it out.

155
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,160
 Yeah.

156
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,160
 But you'd be pouring it out a trillion years in a few days.

157
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,160
 Yeah, I mean more.

158
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,160
 Yeah.

159
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,160
 And it's just like a hundred times longer than the universe has been around.

160
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,160
 But it's a long way.

161
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,160
 If you took all the enzymes out of someone, you fed them a snack.

162
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,160
 What would happen?

163
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,160
 So all the stuff would go into your body.

164
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,160
 Yeah.

165
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,160
 And your body would still try to excrete it.

166
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,160
 So yeah, you just wouldn't digest it.

167
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,160
 So you wouldn't get any of the any of the energy or anything like that.

168
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,160
 So you'd just be reusable.

169
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,160
 Really.

170
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,160
 You wouldn't need different trays.

171
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,160
 Yeah.

172
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:13,160
 So there's, I read a really cool thing about metabolism,

173
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,160
 which is about the difference between a shrew and an elephant's metabolism.

174
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,160
 Yeah.

175
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,160
 So shrews have very, very fast metabolism.

176
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,160
 Their heart's got 1,500 beats per minute.

177
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,160
 And they have to eat twice their body weight every day.

178
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,160
 Twice their body weight every single day.

179
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:34,160
 But every gram of its body uses 67 times more oxygen than a single gram of a human body.

180
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,160
 So they have incredibly fast metabolism, they digest.

181
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,160
 Yes, just I mean they have to breathe in lots of oxygen.

182
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,160
 It does.

183
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,160
 Yeah, they need way more oxygen proportional to their body than elephants do.

184
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,160
 Whereas elephants that was the SSA online about why elephants don't explode.

185
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,160
 So what?

186
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,160
 So elephants have trillions more cells on their inside.

187
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,160
 So they're much hotter on the inside.

188
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,160
 Because their insides are proportionally bigger than their skins.

189
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,160
 An elephant is 250,000 times larger than a mouse,

190
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,160
 but it's only got 5,000 times the surface area.

191
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,160
 So then the big problem is how to let all that heat out.

192
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,160
 And elephants, as a result, have a much slower metabolism.

193
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,160
 So they don't burn food or fuel at the same rate.

194
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,160
 They run much, much cooler than a mouse or a shrew,

195
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,160
 which has little heaters turned up really, really high.

196
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,160
 And so it gets through a lot of fuel really, really fast.

197
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,160
 So it's just that they slow their metabolism, but doesn't that mean?

198
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,160
 Because the shrew is still covered in fur.

199
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,160
 So they must be hot all the time.

200
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,160
 Yeah, they're always running around.

201
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,160
 They're just always running around.

202
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,160
 Yeah, they're probably really.

203
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

204
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,160
 Back to any pig when he got in the freezer must have been like,

205
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,160
 "Oh, fuck, that's it."

206
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:46,160
 I was really a tiny bit about guinea pigs and about guinea pig shows.

207
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,160
 So they're quite a big thing and they've been a big thing.

208
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,160
 They've been a big thing.

209
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,160
 They're like dog shows.

210
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,160
 They've been around since Victorian times.

211
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,160
 And now people take them really seriously.

212
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,160
 So there are over 400 guinea pig shows in Britain every year.

213
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,160
 What?

214
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,160
 I was reading an article about a guinea pig show winner,

215
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,160
 whose a person who owns lots of winning guinea pigs.

216
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,160
 He's called Tony Tankock.

217
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,160
 Tony?

218
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,160
 Yeah, Tony Tankock.

219
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,160
 Tony Tankock, yeah.

220
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:19,160
 That is one thing. He's also the new sunbathing champion of Britain.

221
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:24,160
 So he's got more than 50 guinea pigs,

222
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:29,160
 but he had six show guinea pigs stolen before a show recently, outrageous.

223
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,160
 And he thinks it's just for rivalry because actually even the best show guinea pigs,

224
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,160
 the most valuable, the ones who've won the most competitions,

225
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,160
 chain tanks for about £30 each.

226
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,160
 [laughter]

227
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:50,160
 OK, it's time for fact number two and that is Andy.

228
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,160
 My fact is that Britain has a special team of leak detectives

229
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,160
 who listen to the sound of water using a special stick.

230
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,160
 I've seen it. I've seen it happen near my house.

231
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:04,160
 Have you? Yeah. I was walking with my son and there were these two guys standing in the middle of the road

232
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,160
 and one was leaning into a stick.

233
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,160
 It looks like a very long upside down plunger.

234
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:13,160
 So he had his head sort of in this rubbery thing and he said no.

235
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,160
 And then he looked at the stick up and he moved about a meter down.

236
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,160
 He went, there it is.

237
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,160
 And I didn't know what the hell they were doing, so I just took my son away from it.

238
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,160
 [laughter]

239
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:26,160
 So he was just plunging his ears, trying to get some wet hair out of his brain.

240
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,160
 [laughter]

241
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,160
 They were, they were using a Victorian device, which is still used today to spot leaks and underground pipes.

242
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:37,160
 It's obviously very hard to spot leaks because they're underground pipes.

243
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:42,160
 But they do, the pipes do, the sticks vibrate when a leak is detected.

244
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,160
 And they're often used at night because it means that there's less traffic around.

245
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,160
 So it's easier to detect a stick.

246
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:52,160
 Is it like acoustic vibrations from the sound of the leak coming out of the thing?

247
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,160
 Okay, so that vibrates the stick.

248
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,160
 And do they introduce themselves sort of a parties, do they just say I'm a detective and you put it that?

249
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,160
 [laughter]

250
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,160
 And then it really rebounds, oh thank god my husband's missing.

251
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,160
 [laughter]

252
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,160
 Let me fetch my stick.

253
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:12,160
 Apparently it's like all these pipes make some kind of noise.

254
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:17,160
 But the gurgle of water going through a pipe is slightly different if there's a hole in it.

255
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,160
 [laughter]

256
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,160
 I can believe that.

257
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,160
 So they, yeah, they, they, they just must know the sound really well.

258
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,160
 And it seems to work really well because in a 12 month period from an article I read,

259
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,160
 they've managed to find 18,000 leaks using this stick.

260
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,160
 Wow.

261
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,160
 Yeah.

262
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,160
 And it's extremely necessary.

263
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,160
 So leaks are a massive water problem in this country.

264
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,160
 We have more than 3 billion litres of water leaks per year.

265
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:47,160
 Tim's water, which is the biggest water provider, has 20,500 litres escaping every day per kilometre.

266
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,160
 Escaping.

267
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,160
 So yeah, getting out.

268
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,160
 They want to be free.

269
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,160
 And it's treated water, isn't it?

270
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,160
 Is water that should be good enough to come out of the tap?

271
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,160
 Absolutely.

272
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:59,160
 And the one fifth of the water that's been treated that we're supposed to be drinking or using in our homes,

273
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,160
 one fifth of it leaks away every year.

274
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,160
 I mean, it's terrible.

275
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,160
 It's so wasteful.

276
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,160
 That's a lot.

277
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,160
 There is one way of finding leaks that's not the acoustic sticks.

278
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,160
 Well.

279
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,160
 But it's sniffer dogs.

280
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,160
 So they've recently been employed.

281
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,160
 And I think Scotland is the first place to employ them.

282
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,160
 There are two coca-spaniels named Snipe and Denzel, who again, I think is strong.

283
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,160
 There's really strong.

284
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,160
 They feel like they've been seconded over from the murder squad.

285
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,160
 I don't think the water dog should be called Snipe and Denzel.

286
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,160
 I know.

287
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,160
 I feel sorry for them.

288
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,160
 They should be called Puddle and Splash or something.

289
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,160
 No, they are.

290
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:38,160
 And what's also sad about Snipe and Denzel is that they've been trained by these two soldiers

291
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,160
 who used to serve in Afghanistan and Iraq and did train sniffer dogs there.

292
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,160
 And these two people now decided quite sweetly came back from Afghanistan and Iraq

293
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:51,160
 and decided to start training dogs to sniff out bedbugs and then to sniff out leaks.

294
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,160
 And so this is what they do.

295
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,160
 And the way they do it is they are trained to detect tiny, tiny amounts of chlorine,

296
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,160
 because obviously our water is chlorinated.

297
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,160
 And so they can tell.

298
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,160
 Yeah, it's impressive, isn't it?

299
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,160
 So for companies, leakages in, say, even bathrooms, if you're a big company,

300
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,160
 and you have huge buildings, that results in huge amounts of money being lost.

301
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,160
 So Pepsi, the article I was reading PepsiCo,

302
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,160
 worked out that the money that the person with being paid in that one building

303
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:19,160
 to be the leak detective, was the same amount of money roughly that they were saving

304
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,160
 in what they would have lost through bills.

305
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,160
 Does that mean they might as well just fire them?

306
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,160
 Yeah.

307
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,160
 Well, I can't, yeah, it doesn't look cancel itself out.

308
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,160
 So you might as well just fire him.

309
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,160
 He's redundant.

310
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,160
 Well done, Den. Thanks very much.

311
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,160
 That guy is going to listen to this.

312
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,160
 He walks out of the building.

313
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,160
 It must be that they saved way more than his people.

314
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,160
 Yeah, it must be right.

315
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,160
 And you presented that as though it was going to be a positive thing.

316
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,160
 I thought, weirdly, it was like, hire me, but it will be like,

317
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,160
 you're not wasting any money, you're just, you're a zero because you're not losing the money.

318
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,160
 I mean, you're bringing nothing to this company.

319
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:57,160
 That's like having someone, it's like Pepsi hiring someone to make a kind of Pepsi,

320
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:03,160
 but it costs them like 70p to hire this guy and sell it for 70p.

321
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,160
 What's the point of that?

322
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,160
 This is the actual sentence in the article.

323
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,160
 The employee there had convinced his boss that saving water

324
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,160
 would also save enough money to pay for the employee's time,

325
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,160
 spent tracking and repairing leaks.

326
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,160
 He must do some other stuff.

327
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,160
 Maybe he also works in IT.

328
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,160
 That's possible.

329
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:23,160
 Maybe the leak is bad enough that there's water leaking and gushing all the way through the building.

330
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:28,160
 And so actually, you're preventing that as well as saving the coffee for the water.

331
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,160
 Damn, in the rooms not being used.

332
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,160
 So at least it cancels out just on them.

333
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,160
 See, it did make sense.

334
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,160
 Well, I think by enough, I think that might have been a misquerid.

335
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,160
 And he means you'll save more than that.

336
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,160
 Yeah, more than enough.

337
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,160
 More than enough.

338
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:50,160
 One group of not people, but things that are good at looking for leaks is beavers.

339
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,160
 Because beavers make dams, as we all know.

340
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,160
 And they will always plug any leaks in their dams,

341
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,160
 because it's really important that they have lots of water behind them,

342
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,160
 because they use the water to hide in.

343
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,160
 And so if they get a tiny little hole,

344
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,160
 then they'll immediately put sticks and stuff in.

345
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,160
 But humans don't really like dams.

346
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,160
 And so we'll often put little tubes in there to try and let the water go through the dams.

347
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,160
 And then the beavers will kind of plug it up.

348
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:23,160
 And so, anyway, so they've invented this thing called a beaver deceiver.

349
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:28,160
 And the beaver deceiver is like, it's almost like a triangular pipe that goes in.

350
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,160
 So it means that the flow happens way away from the dam.

351
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:36,160
 And so where the flow goes in, it's not enough of a flow for the beaver to recognize it.

352
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:40,160
 So you can't tell that there's a hole in there, even though there is a hole.

353
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,160
 That's really clever isn't it really?

354
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,160
 So that beaver goes and sees the front of his dam.

355
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,160
 And it doesn't look like there's a hole anywhere in it.

356
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,160
 Yeah, if you put a hole right in a dam,

357
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,160
 then there'll be a flow of water and the beaver will recognize it.

358
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,160
 But if you put the beaver deceiver in,

359
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:57,160
 then the flow of water is coming from quite a long way away from the dam itself.

360
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,160
 And it's much wider there, so the flow is much less.

361
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,160
 It's more subtle.

362
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,160
 It's been sort of dissipated.

363
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:07,160
 I'll be honest, it's mostly about the name that I brought to you.

364
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:15,160
 Okay, it is time for fact number three.

365
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,160
 And that is my fact.

366
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:22,160
 My fact this week is that Japan's cybersecurity minister has never used a computer.

367
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,160
 He's unhackable.

368
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,160
 He's unhackable.

369
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,160
 Yeah, absolutely true.

370
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,160
 Yeah, his name is Yoshitaka Sakurada.

371
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:36,160
 He's 68 years old, and he was made the deputy chief of the government's cybersecurity strategy office.

372
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:42,160
 He also is looking over as the minister for the Olympic and Paralympic Committee for the 2020 Games.

373
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,160
 He's never thrown a javelin either.

374
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,160
 The guy is so unqualified.

375
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,160
 But he was in a parliamentary committee meeting,

376
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:55,160
 and it was during there just after he'd be given the post of cybersecurity minister that he said that he had never used.

377
00:21:55,160 --> 00:22:01,160
 A computer before also seemed quite confused when a USB was brought up, not quite knowing what that was.

378
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,160
 So yeah, pretty astonishing that this guy has been given the post.

379
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:09,160
 And it's been a bit embarrassing for the prime minister because he was the one who gave him the post.

380
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:15,160
 And in fact, two days later, Sakurada actually tried to contradict that statement and said,

381
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,160
 "Of course I have used a computer.

382
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,160
 I just don't use it at home is what I was saying.

383
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,160
 I use it in the office, but no one really."

384
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:29,160
 But he's known for his gaps as well. He's not someone who's particularly good in these parliamentary committee meetings.

385
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:36,160
 He claimed that the Olympics would cost Japan 1,500 yen instead of 150 billion yen.

386
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:43,160
 So 1,500 yen would work out at about 13 dollars for the Olympics.

387
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,160
 It would be a bargain, wouldn't it?

388
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,160
 If you could do it for that much.

389
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:52,160
 Well if the Olympics bring in as much money as they cost.

390
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,160
 Yeah, a bit like that guy at Pepsi.

391
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,160
 Yeah, you may as well just not have the Olympics.

392
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:59,160
 It's a problem solved.

393
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:05,160
 When he did say this about not using computers, there was a lot of people online who were taking the mic out of him.

394
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:10,160
 But someone did say you don't need to know how to drive a tractor to be a good agriculture minister,

395
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,160
 which I think is almost a good point.

396
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:21,160
 As in the ministry, if you're a minister of something, you're tending to oversee things rather than actually using them.

397
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:26,160
 Absolutely, although that's quite a slightly controversial thing, people sometimes object to anyway,

398
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:31,160
 that the person who is most senior in charge of various ministries like foreign affairs or defence,

399
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,160
 whatever, never knows what they're doing.

400
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,160
 But politicians in general don't ask democracy for you.

401
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:43,160
 If you want to have some kind of system where clever people are in charge, then that's enough.

402
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,160
 Good luck to you.

403
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,160
 But it's always weird.

404
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:49,160
 So I was reading, I was looking into unqualified ministers generally.

405
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:54,160
 But then I did think government ministers who had suddenly shifted to transport even though they don't even know what a bus looks like,

406
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,160
 is quite strange.

407
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:02,160
 And I went into your Margaret Beckett in 2006 when she was suddenly shifted to be foreign secretary.

408
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:06,160
 And I think she'd been environment before or agriculture before that.

409
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,160
 And she openly said, "I'm completely flying by the seat of my pants."

410
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,160
 And she was appointed on Friday evening.

411
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,160
 And she had to swap up over the weekend Monday morning.

412
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,160
 She's just flown to discuss Iran negotiations with Condoleezza Rice.

413
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,160
 And that's a baptism of fire.

414
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,160
 You don't get that in most jobs.

415
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,160
 Yeah, this is weird.

416
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,160
 I'm reading a book kind of about this at the moment.

417
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,160
 I'm Michael Lewis.

418
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,160
 Yeah, it's called the fifth risk.

419
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:31,160
 And it's all about project management and how you fill roles.

420
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,160
 He's writing about the Department of Energy.

421
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:37,160
 And the guy who got the job had previously said he wanted to shut the Department of Energy down.

422
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,160
 Or he said he couldn't even remember which department he wanted to shut down.

423
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,160
 Yeah.

424
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,160
 Rick Perry.

425
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,160
 Oh, yeah, Rick Perry.

426
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,160
 Yeah.

427
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,160
 And then he was given the job.

428
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,160
 So I think some level of knowledge is probably good.

429
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,160
 But there is an argument, isn't there?

430
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,160
 I mean, this is a bit technical and probably boring.

431
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:57,160
 But there is an argument that you should just have people in charge who know what they're doing.

432
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,160
 But the argument against that.

433
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,160
 What a ridiculous argument.

434
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:08,160
 I think it's like what we found that democracy is better where everyone gets a vote even though people don't really understand what they're voting for.

435
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,160
 And that means that everyone is kind of invested in it.

436
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:15,160
 And so even if you make a bad decision, at least everyone's invested in that bad decision.

437
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:19,160
 Whereas if you promote people who are supposed to be just good at things,

438
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:24,160
 number one, who decides who's good at stuff, but number two, no one else is invested in that.

439
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:30,160
 So if things go wrong, which they always do, then that's when you chop people's heads up.

440
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,160
 That's fine.

441
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,160
 I'd rather chop one person's head off than us all have to go down together taking the blame.

442
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,160
 For me, anti-democratic.

443
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,160
 I'm not saying one's better than the other, but you know.

444
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,160
 I like experts and autocracy.

445
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,160
 So I'm just going to flag it up.

446
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:47,160
 So on Japanese computing stuff, the Japanese government is currently engaged.

447
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:52,160
 It's just beginning a massive exercise to hack 200 million objects.

448
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:58,160
 And they're quite worried about cybersecurity and about the Internet of Things.

449
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,160
 You know what I'm saying?

450
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,160
 I just think he's meant to be hacking things.

451
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,160
 He's sitting there with a manual, a huge hacker's manual.

452
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:09,160
 No, this guy is probably, he thinks that he's hacking just 20 things.

453
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:16,160
 And so they're doing a five-year experiment hacking into Internet of Things.

454
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,160
 They've just got legal permission to do it.

455
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,160
 Because obviously it's like a conversation.

456
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,160
 So you're talking about like smart things in houses.

457
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,160
 Exactly, yeah.

458
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,160
 Also, you'll just have a government minister suddenly talking through your fridge to you or something.

459
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,160
 Why do you do that?

460
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,160
 I mean, sort of.

461
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:36,160
 It's a test security because they're very worried about, you know, the chaos that can be caused by hacking into things.

462
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:41,160
 And you know, people don't have web-enabled yoga mats.

463
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,160
 Yeah, really?

464
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,160
 Yeah.

465
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,160
 And they've all got factory settings.

466
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:48,160
 But it's always zero, zero, zero, zero, or whatever.

467
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,160
 What's a yoga mat doing to you that needs a smart?

468
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,160
 I thought, I mean, it's just a rug, isn't it?

469
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,160
 It's going to say to you, you're putting too much pressure on your left wrist.

470
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:59,160
 So you need to change your, you know, the way that you're dogging.

471
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:03,160
 You're being a bit self-righteous and tedious about your yoga.

472
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,160
 Stop boring all your friends.

473
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:13,160
 No, Singapore did a very similar thing, I think, which is, I think this is a couple of years ago,

474
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:17,160
 hundreds of hackers were invited by the government to try and hack into its defense ministry.

475
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,160
 And so, and they offered their rewards.

476
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,160
 So they basically said everyone tried to crack into our security systems.

477
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:28,160
 And they distributed $15,000 price money between all these hackers who successfully said,

478
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,160
 "Yeah, I've just hacked in here and found out the planning to bomb Russia tomorrow."

479
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,160
 Singapore.

480
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,160
 Singapore.

481
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,160
 Yeah, I know.

482
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,160
 Very surprising.

483
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:40,160
 Do you know that if you connect to someone else's Wi-Fi hotspot is Singapore without the permission,

484
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,160
 you can get three years in prison?

485
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,160
 Wow.

486
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,160
 Really?

487
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,160
 Did not know that.

488
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:50,160
 I think the whole hacking thing though, I mean, in Japan particularly, I guess it is a bit of a worrying problem

489
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:55,160
 because, let's say Tokyo, they're just really implementing the idea of robots running a lot of things.

490
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,160
 That's got to be a huge problem.

491
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:01,160
 So for example, a robot last year ran for election in Japan.

492
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,160
 And it got 4,000 votes.

493
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,160
 It came third in the election.

494
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,160
 I think these things are never as far along as the makers claim.

495
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,160
 No, robots still rubbish.

496
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,160
 It came third.

497
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,160
 It came third.

498
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,160
 Japan, actually.

499
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:14,160
 That says more about the people voting for it than the robot now.

500
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,160
 That's true.

501
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,160
 I mean, America just elected a puppet.

502
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,160
 Whoa!

503
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,160
 Puppet.

504
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,160
 Yes.

505
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,160
 Yeah.

506
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:25,160
 Japan is actually not that advanced in computers.

507
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,160
 Well, I think we must have mentioned before.

508
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:33,160
 But in Japan, computers aren't the norm for a lot of people in the same way that they are in the Western world.

509
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,160
 So fax is still a very big thing in Japan.

510
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,160
 It's really, really common.

511
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:40,160
 You wouldn't send an email naturally if you were sort of booking a restaurant or something.

512
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:44,160
 Or there was a journalist who went and she wanted an interview with, I think, a government minister.

513
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,160
 And they said, you can't email us to book an interview or use any computers.

514
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,160
 You have to do it by fax.

515
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,160
 Yeah.

516
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,160
 If you RSVPing, it's all by fax machine.

517
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:57,160
 So I don't think it's maybe as big a deal for this guy to have said he's never used a computer,

518
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,160
 because it's maybe not as much the norm in your day-to-day life.

519
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,160
 That's a top-send.

520
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,160
 And it's all smart phones, basically.

521
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:09,160
 Do you think there's, like, a Japanese podcast saying that the head of digital security in the UK has never used a fax machine?

522
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,160
 [laughter]

523
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:15,160
 Actually, speaking of that, there's only one MP.

524
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,160
 This is in 2016. There's been an election since, but I think it's still true.

525
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:23,160
 There's only one MP who doesn't accept emails from constituents.

526
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,160
 And you have to send them a fax instead.

527
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,160
 Or a letter.

528
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,160
 And that is Dr. Julian Lewis.

529
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,160
 Oh, he's one of the big brecks here, guys.

530
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,160
 Yes, yeah.

531
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,160
 And they found this out.

532
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:40,160
 There was someone called the family Nixon, who worked for a company called Right to Them.

533
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:43,160
 And this is a website that lets you get in touch with your MP.

534
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,160
 And they found out that the fax machine had broken.

535
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:48,160
 And they tried to work out whether they had to buy a new one or not.

536
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:53,160
 And they realized that there was only one MP in the whole country that they needed a fax machine for.

537
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,160
 And it was this Julian Lewis guy.

538
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,160
 Really?

539
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,160
 Absolutely.

540
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,160
 The FBI is very into faxing still.

541
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:08,160
 In fact, the FBI in 2017 said it will no longer accept freedom of information requests by email.

542
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,160
 It's only accepting them by fax again.

543
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,160
 Wow.

544
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,160
 So that you can either fax or use snail mail.

545
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,160
 Is that just so that people can't be bothered?

546
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,160
 I think it's to make it a bit more difficult, yeah.

547
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:25,160
 This is a big thing in America as in technological illiteracy by, you know, senators or congresspeople.

548
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:30,160
 So when Mark Zuckerberg appeared in front of senators to answer all these questions about Facebook,

549
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:36,160
 he was asked questions, including, is Twitter the same as what you do?

550
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:43,160
 And if I'm emailing within WhatsApp, does that inform your advertisers?

551
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,160
 What was face mash?

552
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,160
 Is it still up and running?

553
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,160
 I don't know what face mash was.

554
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:53,160
 Face mash was his very first site where, yeah, it was grading.

555
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,160
 I know, yeah, I remember that.

556
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:58,160
 Oh, I thought it was the thing where you combine your face with someone else's face.

557
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,160
 That's what I thought when you said be like a baby.

558
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,160
 No.

559
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,160
 What?

560
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,160
 Like if you had a kid and you combined your heads and you told you what you'll.

561
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,160
 Kid would look like, okay.

562
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,160
 Yeah, maybe.

563
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,160
 Maybe I'm wrong about face mash.

564
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,160
 See, I don't know.

565
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,160
 Maybe I'm wrong.

566
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,160
 Maybe I thought that was his first thing.

567
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:16,160
 Well, I think we've established it's a totally justified relationship.

568
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,160
 And well done for asking.

569
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:23,160
 That's so good, though. It's like he's basically been called round to his grandparents place.

570
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:27,160
 There are a thousand grandparents there.

571
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:35,160
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show.

572
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,160
 And that is Chazinski.

573
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:42,160
 My fact this week is that a Mumbai businessman is trying to sue his parents for giving birth to him.

574
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,160
 And his mother has responded by saying,

575
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:50,160
 if she'd met him before he was born, she definitely wouldn't have done it.

576
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:56,160
 So this is this guy from Mumbai and he said his parents gave birth to him without his consent.

577
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,160
 And you shouldn't be allowed to do that.

578
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,160
 It's wrong to bring children into the world without their consent.

579
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:05,160
 They're destined to a life of constant suffering that they didn't choose.

580
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,160
 And so he's suing his parents.

581
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:12,160
 And the thing is going to make it a bit harder for him is that both his parents are lawyers.

582
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:20,160
 So I had one other thing his mother said, which is if he could come up with a rational explanation as to how we could have sought his consent to be born, I will accept my fault.

583
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,160
 Yeah, that's fair enough.

584
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:26,160
 So this is anti-natalism, which I had never heard of up until this.

585
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,160
 Well, it's quite a new concept.

586
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,160
 Yeah, it's an amazing concept, though, isn't it?

587
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,160
 It's just the idea that why are we alive at all?

588
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,160
 We should just stop having babies, but we shouldn't be upset about that.

589
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:39,160
 We should be thinking of we're doing the universal favour.

590
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,160
 Why? Sorry.

591
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:44,160
 They just think we're born into suffering that we're born into.

592
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:50,160
 If you know that you've got certain diseases in your family that you know might genetically go down, that's a bit different.

593
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,160
 That is just like everything.

594
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,160
 Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of reasons as well.

595
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:57,160
 One reason is overpopulation, which is always a thing that people can't pay for.

596
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:01,160
 But the other thing is like by bringing in birth, it means that you're bringing in death.

597
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:06,160
 So it guarantees that whoever is alive, there is going to be some kind of suffering for them.

598
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,160
 Yeah, I guess so.

599
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:12,160
 And it's the idea, basically, that by having someone give birth, you add something negative.

600
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:17,160
 He says it's wrong to bring children into the world because even he admits my life is proportionately very good.

601
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,160
 It's absolutely fine, I'm perfectly happy, but I'd rather not be here.

602
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,160
 It's like there's a nice room, but I don't really want to be in that room.

603
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,160
 We'll piss off her.

604
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:28,160
 No, no, you can't say that.

605
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:34,160
 Guy falls dying, and then he says, "Well, it's really unfair to have locked me with the decision of whether or not I kill myself."

606
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:40,160
 And this actually comes from this guy who had a similarly low bar for what equal suffering.

607
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:44,160
 So it's this guy called David Benatar, who wrote a book called Better To Have Never Been.

608
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,160
 And that was, I think, about...

609
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,160
 It should have been written in the book, should it?

610
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,160
 He really regrets it.

611
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,160
 It should have never been written in the book.

612
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:56,160
 It's the best seller buy, really, which is probably up there.

613
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,160
 So he's a really fun guy.

614
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:03,160
 And he says that we're almost always hungry or thirsty.

615
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,160
 When we're not, we always have to go to the bathroom.

616
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,160
 We're always experiencing it.

617
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,160
 I think it's going to touch us.

618
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:14,160
 I'm capable of going an hour or time without eating or drinking or going to the bathroom.

619
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,160
 And I don't think I'm special, I should say.

620
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:19,160
 Would you not say you're always a bit hungry or thirsty?

621
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,160
 No.

622
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,160
 Or if not, he says...

623
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,160
 Are you not a bad thing, though?

624
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,160
 I'm a bit thirsty, yeah.

625
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:28,160
 Oh no, I should never have been born.

626
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:34,160
 Or if that, he says, and this is something that you can't deny Andy, he says...

627
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,160
 We're always experiencing thermal discomfort.

628
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,160
 We're always a bit too hot or a bit too cold.

629
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,160
 You literally just tell me to turn the heating down.

630
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,160
 That's true.

631
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,160
 Okay, I'm in.

632
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,160
 Or too tired.

633
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:50,160
 I'm not tired, but that's any because we're recording at about 10 to 1 in the afternoon.

634
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:54,160
 You said it's quite new, but this idea has been around for quite a long time.

635
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,160
 Not the name, anti-natalism, but other stuff.

636
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:04,160
 So the Enchrotites, which were an old sex, they said that in order to conquer death,

637
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,160
 people should desist from procreation.

638
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:11,160
 The Manichains, the Boga Mills, the Cathars, they all thought that kind of thing.

639
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:14,160
 But obviously not any of them really around now.

640
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,160
 And that's kind of the problem with this.

641
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,160
 If it's your doctrine, then you don't really send it down to your children or your children.

642
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,160
 All or nothing, isn't it?

643
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,160
 Unless you can persuade everyone, your idea is not going to be the one that survives.

644
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:29,160
 So there's a group called the voluntary human extinction movement, which set up in 1991.

645
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,160
 Until 1992.

646
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,160
 And that was a guy called Les Knight, who founded it.

647
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,160
 And it just asks people not to have children, basically.

648
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,160
 And he said, "I consider it a success.

649
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,160
 Every time one more of us decides not to add one more of us."

650
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,160
 It needs to be the enforced human extinction movement, doesn't it?

651
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,160
 It's not going to work in this country.

652
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,160
 Yeah, actually it's that guy from Avengers, isn't it?

653
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,160
 It's the same idea.

654
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,160
 What's he called from the latest Avengers?

655
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,160
 Thanos.

656
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,160
 Yeah, Thanos, spoiler alert, if you haven't seen it.

657
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,160
 But you really should have done.

658
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:02,160
 But at the end of it, he kind of kills half of all beings in the universe.

659
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,160
 Wow.

660
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,160
 They just disappear.

661
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,160
 And the idea is there's overpopulation.

662
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,160
 And he thinks that, you know, that's the best way of doing it.

663
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,160
 And it's completely random in the Avengers.

664
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,160
 So all at once you just start to disappear half of the people.

665
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,160
 Wow.

666
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,160
 I think warn people.

667
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,160
 There's no reason not to warn people.

668
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,160
 Well, they knew because the Avengers were fighting against it.

669
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:22,160
 So they kind of knew that this guy was going to do something.

670
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,160
 But you should have time to set your affairs in order and feed the cat.

671
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,160
 And the event that the cat survives.

672
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,160
 Is the cat saying?

673
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,160
 That's generally what you're saying.

674
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,160
 Well, if you've got two cats, you should put out one lot of food basically.

675
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:36,160
 Well, you don't know because your two might both survive when they might both die.

676
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,160
 And the other thing is if you're the one who disappears, but your cat doesn't,

677
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,160
 then the cat's going to starve to death.

678
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,160
 So actually, it's going to be more than half of the universe.

679
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:48,160
 Some people are reliant on others.

680
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:53,160
 Cats aren't reliant on us.

681
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,160
 The dogs will die.

682
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,160
 Sure.

683
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,160
 I do find it an amazing concept.

684
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,160
 I'm definitely.

685
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,160
 The Avengers, yeah.

686
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,160
 Yeah.

687
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,160
 Right down the name of that title.

688
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,160
 But no, the idea of, you know, should we go on?

689
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,160
 I'm on the side that we should.

690
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,160
 I've proved that.

691
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,160
 I've just had a baby.

692
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,160
 I've proved it.

693
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,160
 I've got proof that I think that.

694
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,160
 But I do, you do kind of go, well, why are we going?

695
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,160
 What are we going on for?

696
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,160
 I can see that their side of it is sort of going,

697
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:21,160
 what if we've actually woken up to the idea that there's all this suffering going on?

698
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,160
 And our job is to be clever enough to end it completely.

699
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,160
 Yeah.

700
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,160
 The life is a mistake.

701
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,160
 It's if we haven't seen it anywhere else.

702
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,160
 Yeah, but there's just such a big concept.

703
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,160
 I think the planet has got resources to give a town of, say,

704
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,160
 20,000 people a really good time.

705
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,160
 You know, but I guess if you just keep those 20,000 people alive,

706
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,160
 we'll just have a vote.

707
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,160
 Or we'll have a random ballot.

708
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,160
 And we'll just say, you 20,000, you get to survive.

709
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,160
 And you're going to have a great time.

710
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,160
 You would love it if there weren't that many.

711
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,160
 You would have loved it in the Stone Age.

712
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:49,160
 In the Stone Age, they've recently done a study at the start, the Stone Age,

713
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:53,160
 that in the whole of Europe, there are about 1,500 people.

714
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,160
 Lovely.

715
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,160
 We just about the same number has come to one of our shows.

716
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,160
 But that's over the whole of Europe.

717
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,160
 Yeah, that's crazy.

718
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,160
 That's crazy.

719
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,160
 Travel and parking will be a nightmare for that show, wouldn't it?

720
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,160
 If everyone from Europe was coming to it.

721
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,160
 Yes, but parking in the rest of Europe would be quite good.

722
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,160
 Oh, yeah.

723
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,160
 If you were the one person that didn't want to go to the show,

724
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,160
 it would be bliss, wouldn't it?

725
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,160
 Pros are empty.

726
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,160
 It is interesting.

727
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,160
 And you having a child doesn't actually prove

728
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,160
 that you don't believe in this.

729
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,160
 It just means you're a hypocrite.

730
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,160
 Just means you're shit at contraception.

731
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,160
 No, it's not me, guys.

732
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,160
 I messed up big time.

733
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,160
 Yeah, I mean, a lot of us do things

734
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,160
 that we wouldn't say morally what we believe in.

735
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,160
 Right.

736
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,160
 In fact, the guy Benatar, who's sort of come up with...

737
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,160
 It's got 50 kids.

738
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:41,160
 He won't admit.

739
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,160
 He won't tell journalists that New York interviewed him and said,

740
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,160
 "Do you have children yourself?"

741
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,160
 And he said, "I'd rather not answer that.

742
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,160
 I don't see how it's relevant to my argument."

743
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,160
 Really?

744
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,160
 There's only evidence that he hadn't quite believed it at, you know,

745
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,160
 nine months before the time of the birth of his child.

746
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,160
 So he might have changed his mind now.

747
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,160
 He might have changed his mind.

748
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,160
 That's a really good point.

749
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,160
 After he met the kid.

750
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,160
 That was a one thing that changed his mind.

751
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,160
 This one by businessman thinks he should never have been born as worse

752
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:08,160
 if your parents become anti-natalists after your born.

753
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,160
 As you just say, a lot of these facts we were mentioning

754
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,160
 came from this brilliant article in the New Yorker.

755
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,160
 It's called "The History of Blood"

756
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,160
 and would definitely recommend reading it.

757
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,160
 Just on weird lawsuits.

758
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,160
 Yeah.

759
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,160
 I didn't know about this lawsuit in the 19th century.

760
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,160
 So in 1893, where the Supreme Court got involved

761
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,160
 in whether tomato was a fruit or a vegetable.

762
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,160
 Why?

763
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,160
 Why did they do this?

764
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,160
 So the ruling is actually in.

765
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,160
 And it was a lawsuit that was brought by the next family

766
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,160
 so they were big sellers of tomatoes.

767
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,160
 And it was against this guy called Edward Heden.

768
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,160
 And it was to recover some fees they'd spent.

769
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,160
 There's some tax they'd paid on exporting some tomatoes.

770
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:50,160
 Because there was a rule that tax had to be paid on imported vegetables

771
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,160
 but not on fruit.

772
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:55,160
 And then they were like, well, tomato is technically a fruit.

773
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,160
 So we shouldn't have to pay tax on that.

774
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,160
 Went to court.

775
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,160
 And everyone got their dictionaries out in court

776
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,160
 and brought up different definitions of fruits and vegetables.

777
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:04,160
 And it was ruled that tomato is a vegetable.

778
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,160
 According to the Supreme Court, you had to pay tax on it

779
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:10,160
 because everyone sort of thinks of it as a vegetable.

780
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,160
 I don't think it is though.

781
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,160
 Well, it's not botanically, but they said that's not relevant

782
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,160
 for tax purposes.

783
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:18,160
 I remember reading that I think by law in the EU,

784
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,160
 a carrot is a fruit.

785
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,160
 It is.

786
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,160
 A carrot is a carrot, a cucumber, sweet potato.

787
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,160
 It's because in Portugal, they make jam out of it.

788
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,160
 Yeah.

789
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,160
 And so jam has different fruit, if you're fruit jam,

790
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,160
 then you've got certain tax rules that apply to you.

791
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,160
 And so it's got to make sure.

792
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,160
 And there's a thing a directive that says,

793
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,160
 for these purposes, carrots, cucumbers, sweet potatoes are all fruits.

794
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,160
 Wow.

795
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,160
 And that's why we're leaving.

796
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,160
 So you can make a really--

797
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,160
 [LAUGHTER]

798
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:48,160
 There was a guy in 2006 called Alan Heckard

799
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:52,160
 who tried to sue Michael Jordan for $416 million

800
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,160
 on the grounds that he looked like him.

801
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:59,160
 And this guy said that it was ruining his life.

802
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,160
 He couldn't go to church.

803
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,160
 He couldn't go to the shops.

804
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,160
 He couldn't eat out without being mistaken

805
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,160
 for Michael Jordan.

806
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,160
 People were coming out with him.

807
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,160
 So he actually-- so he paid the fee.

808
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,160
 This is the weird thing.

809
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,160
 You pay a fee to file this lawsuit.

810
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,160
 It's like $200.

811
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:14,160
 And he also sued Nike for the same amount,

812
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,160
 because it was their responsibility as well

813
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,160
 for making Jordan famous.

814
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,160
 And weirdly, though, I've looked at pictures.

815
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,160
 And basically, the similarities are that he's bald

816
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,160
 like Michael Jordan.

817
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,160
 He has an earring and exactly the same ear,

818
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,160
 which I suppose he could have removed.

819
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,160
 He's exactly the same ear.

820
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,160
 [LAUGHTER]

821
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,160
 And he wears a Jordan shoes.

822
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,160
 [LAUGHTER]

823
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,160
 And always a basketball jersey

824
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,160
 with the name Jordan.

825
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,160
 [LAUGHTER]

826
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,160
 Wow.

827
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,160
 He lost, right?

828
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,160
 No, he won.

829
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,160
 Yeah, a billion dollars.

830
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:48,160
 [LAUGHTER]

831
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,160
 Yeah, he did not win.

 OK, that's it.

 That is all of our facts.

 No such thing as a fish.com.

 They are up there now.

853
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,160
 We're very excited to be going.

854
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,160
 Check them out.

855
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,160
 Hopefully, see you there.

856
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,160
 And hopefully, see you all again next week.

857
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,160
 When we do another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish.

858
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,160
 Goodbye.
