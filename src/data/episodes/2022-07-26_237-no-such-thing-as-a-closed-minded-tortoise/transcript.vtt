WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:24.120
 No one is coming to you from 2020 Audio.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.340
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.140
 and Annotch is Innski and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.940
 4th favorite facts from the last 7 days and in no particular order here we go.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.540
 Sorry Dan, can I ask you who 2020 Audio is?

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.540
 Yes.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.540
 I came out of nowhere a little bit.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.540
 Yeah sorry about that.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.980
 2020 Audio is where we are recording the audiobook for our Book of the Year which will

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.820
 be entitled "Audio Book of the Year" and we are in the very booth that it has been recorded.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:54.820
 Yes.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:01.340
 The honour of being in the same booth as the no such thing as a fish team when they recorded

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.020
 the audio but not 1 hour ago.

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.020
 That author is, we are mere podcasters, such an honour.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.180
 Okay, starting with fact number 1 and that is Andy.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:19.620
 My fact is that there are whales alive today who were alive before Moby Dick was written.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:20.620
 Wow.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.940
 Does that mean so that book was written about a real whale?

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:25.940
 Yes.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.940
 So might that whale still be alive?

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:28.940
 No.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:35.820
 So because there are different kinds of whales there are particular whales which do live

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.180
 for at least 200 years.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.180
 We know that but they are bow head whales and I think the whale and Moby Dick was a sperm

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.180
 whale.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.180
 Yeah.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.060
 So I don't know how long live sperm whales are actually.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.060
 It is possible.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.060
 Wow.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.060
 There is a bow head.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.060
 Sorry you said bow head whales.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.380
 So bow head whales are they have got a life expectancy that can actually go up to 250 years

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.420
 I remember.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:03.220
 So that would mean that not only were they alive longer then let's say the book itself

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.140
 Moby Dick was written but potentially there is one that is alive that was born the year

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.020
 that Herman Melville the author of Moby Dick was born.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.020
 Oh wow.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.740
 Yeah he wrote the book at 32 years old.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:13.740
 Wow.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.740
 And it was in 1851.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:15.740
 Yes.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.460
 And here is another thing the first New England Whalers so the first people from North America

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:26.740
 who were whaling around there they started in 1791 and that was 227 years ago.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.380
 So there might be some whales alive who remember a time before whaling in that area of the

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.380
 world.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.380
 Wow.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.820
 Oh my god the time when they were free roaming the waters with no fear.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:37.820
 Well this is the thing.

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.740
 So there was this massive bout of whaling in the Arctic especially between 1848 and 1915.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.980
 So the bowhead whales in the Arctic all but about I think 1200 of them were killed 30 years

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.660
 ago they're only about 1200 left.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.380
 So it's not like we have an individual we can definitely point to that whale and say that

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.860
 one was alive before Moby Dick.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:02.060
 But they did find one recently which had a harpoon in it and they tested the age of the

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:08.860
 harpoon and they found it had only been manufactured between 1879 and 1885 that specific harpoon.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.960
 So the whale was probably harpooned sometime from 1885 to 95 or it could be someone who

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:19.240
 just likes old harpoons like a modern day guy who's you know he's just using really old

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.240
 material.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.180
 It could have been harpooned three years ago with an ancient harpoon supported off the day.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.460
 But they reckon that that one that they found the harpoon and was 211 years old.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.460
 So that's yeah.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.740
 So basically these bowhead whales in particular are very very old.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.020
 And it's one of the best ways to date them sometimes is when the harpoons came from because

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:41.260
 they're often found with harpoons in them embedded in their blubber, aren't they?

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.500
 But we should say with bowhead whales you were saying there were only about 1200 left.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.340
 That was about 30, 30 years ago.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.620
 And today there are 14,000 some good whale news.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:50.620
 Oh, that was good.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.020
 So that actually conservation is really worth.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.020
 Wow.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.380
 But yeah people used to harpoon a lot but whales can survive a huge amount of harpooning.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:04.380
 So in fact the whale that Moby Dick was based on was a real life whale called Mocha Dick.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.580
 You can see how a Melville really uses imagination when he switched names there.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.900
 And Mocha Dick was a super famous whale in the 1830s, sort of terrorised boaters.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.220
 And it was swim really calmly next to a wailing boat.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.540
 But then at the first sign of aggression from the boat it would like attack the boat and

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:20.540
 tip people out.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.860
 And when it finally died in 1839 it had 19 harpoons lodged in its side.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:25.860
 Wow.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.860
 There he is bits of harpoon.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:27.860
 19.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:28.860
 Wow.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.660
 Because they get stuck in the blubber don't they?

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:31.660
 Yeah.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.220
 And Mocha Dick was a sperm whale I think.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:39.500
 Of the bowhead whales they have more blubber than anyone they have up to half a meter thick

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.500
 of blubber.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.500
 Wow.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.500
 That is a lot I think.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.660
 You sort of body shaming the old bowhead a little bit aren't you?

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.700
 Well they're really weird animals aren't they?

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:54.220
 Because they've got a skull which is up to 40% of their body length.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.340
 So the skull alone could be over five meters long.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.580
 And the really weird thing about them is that they have the largest mouth of any living

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:02.580
 animal.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.860
 But they have no teeth.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.660
 Like large in terms of depth breath.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:07.660
 I think volume.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:08.660
 Volume.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:09.660
 Yeah.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.060
 So it's larger than a blue whale's mouth even though the bowhead is slightly smaller it's

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:17.860
 got such a massive head that I've read this fact about blue whales which I guess must

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.900
 be true about bowhead whales if it's true about blue whales which you might not be.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:27.100
 But it is that the amount of water that a blue whale can fit in its mouth is heavier than

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.100
 a blue whale itself.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.100
 What?

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.100
 Oh really?

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.100
 Yeah.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.100
 That's plausible actually isn't it?

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.100
 Yeah.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.420
 Are you going to say why don't they sink?

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.420
 No, I wasn't.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:42.180
 I was going to say do they expand to a double blue whale size like a pufferfish?

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.580
 No it's about different densities so I guess water's more dense.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:46.580
 Yeah.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.620
 Then blubber especially because blubber's quite buoyant isn't it?

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:50.620
 Yeah.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.220
 That's why women I think are often better at floating.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.940
 This is actually only my subjective experience but I find it quite easy to swim and I'm

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.620
 often swimming with men who sink more easily and I think it's because women naturally

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:02.620
 have a bit more water fat.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.180
 But you are going regularly harpoon to a little downside aren't you?

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:10.060
 I've got 14 harpoons in pale in my sight at this moment.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.740
 I should just sorry just one more thing I learned about harpoons that I didn't know which

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.700
 I found out from that one that was discovered that was 130 years old.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:22.100
 They had explosives in them which I didn't realise they did so they harpoon them and they

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.100
 were timed explosive.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.340
 This is in the mid 19th century, timed explosive so they went inside and then they were

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:32.140
 timed to explode once in there.

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:35.820
 They didn't use harpoons to kill whales did they?

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:39.260
 That's you kill a whale with a lance or with a club or something like that.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.260
 You use your harpoon to kind of catch it and then it kind of drags you along until it

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.700
 gets tired and then once it's tired you can kind of kill it with something else.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.580
 I see.

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:53.540
 The bowhead whales, have we said before that they have giant penises in their heads?

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:54.540
 What?

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:58.100
 Well, sort of very penis equivalent thing.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.660
 They have this massive ridge of tissue and it's called the corpus cavernosum axilaris.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:07.540
 Now any latin or penis fans might remember that there is a thing in the human penis called

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:11.100
 the corpus cavernosum and that's the thing which fills with blood, those are the chambers

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:15.460
 which fill up and they do the same thing in the whale but they're to cool the whale down.

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:19.700
 So when the whale is swimming around and is getting really active there's a real risk

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.060
 that they'll overheat because they've got so much blood there they can get really hot

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:29.380
 really easily so they engorge this corpus cavernosum axilaris which means in the head with blood

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:33.620
 and then it opens its mouth, cold sea water flows in, cools the blood flows back out.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.500
 So it's their way of cooling themselves down using this giant head penis.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:40.900
 That's weird that they need to cool themselves down because they are found in cool water which

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:44.140
 is one of the reasons for their longevity, isn't it?

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:47.340
 Yeah, but they're constantly wearing a really thick coat basically and if you're trying

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:52.740
 to do anything in a thick coat or warm up, it is a bit like having a big coat all

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:58.620
 the time on a cold day but then whenever you want to cool down, get in an erection and pouring

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:03.620
 cold water into your butts and that's effectively what we're saying, isn't it?

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:06.260
 Yeah, it doesn't sound like a crazy way of cooling down.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:07.260
 It does.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.860
 I think people would call you crazy if you started doing that.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:10.860
 Not on the bus.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:11.860
 Not on the bus.

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:17.980
 Oh, I actually have a coat fact related to whales.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:23.900
 Yeah, I love this. Some of the earliest waterproof jackets were made from whale intestines and

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.900
 it was the innuets who used to wear them because they are really waterproof.

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:31.340
 I was thinking intestines are full of water, bodily water, but very permeable because the

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:35.980
 nutrients have to permeate through them and so yeah, they would turn them into waterproof

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:36.980
 jackets.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:37.980
 That is amazing.

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:40.580
 I don't really know what an intestine looks like but I imagine it's a bit like a puffer

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:43.620
 jacket because it's going to have lots of folds in it.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:44.620
 You're right.

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:45.620
 All the folds.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:49.060
 So, what would they do to preserve it so it doesn't rot?

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:52.140
 Oh, I guess they're keeping it on ice most of the time anyway.

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:53.580
 Yeah, that's a good point.

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:54.580
 That's a good point.

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:55.580
 If you dry it out, I guess.

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:56.580
 Don't know that.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:57.580
 Oh, that's true.

00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:58.580
 We wear leather clothes sometimes.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:08:59.580
 Yeah.

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:00.580
 Just cure it.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:06.060
 Yeah, cure it with urine, for instance, if you get cow hide and then you put a load of urine

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:09.420
 on it for ages and ages and ages, it'll get cured and it won't go rotten.

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:10.420
 This is very weird.

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:13.900
 I have another whale based clothing fact, which I didn't even realise and it's about

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:14.900
 Moby Dick too.

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:21.060
 So, there's a whole chapter in Moby Dick on the whale's penis and it's called the casak.

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:26.220
 It's pretty gruesome reading but the men, the whalers, they cut off a whale's penis, they

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:31.180
 skin it and then they turn the skin into a sleeveless robe, kind of like a onesie.

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:32.180
 Oh, cool.

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:33.180
 Yeah.

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:39.980
 And it's specifically for a man called the mincer and his job is to chop blubber and keep

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:41.620
 cooking it in the pot.

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:43.620
 Isn't it true that someone had a yacht?

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:44.620
 I want to say Jackie Onassis.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:47.700
 It was Onassis, the husband, yeah.

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:48.700
 Aristotle Onassis.

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:49.700
 Aristotle Onassis.

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:52.340
 And well, I think you're going to know this fact, Dan, if you say that.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:58.780
 But did they have a chair, which was, had whale penis as the, yeah, it was the skin of

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:00.860
 the chair was whale penis, I believe.

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.180
 Who's upholsted in it, yeah.

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.180
 Oh.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:04.180
 Hmm.

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:08.420
 Who thought, first, of pissing on a cow hide to cure it?

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:09.420
 What?

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:10.420
 Unknown genius.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:13.220
 They, they used piss for a lot of things, didn't they?

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:14.220
 Yeah.

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:15.220
 They tried everything.

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:16.220
 Don't they?

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:17.220
 We on everything.

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:18.220
 See what sticks.

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:19.220
 Mostly it's not useful.

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:23.660
 It's always just one person in the village going, have you pissed on it?

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:24.660
 Just for everything.

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.020
 Every new thing being tested.

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:31.980
 Well, my, my iPhone stuff worked.

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:37.180
 I wonder though, if the penis bit in Moby Dick stayed in the British version, because the

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:40.260
 one that was printed in Britain was massively changed, wasn't it?

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:41.740
 Which caused serious problems.

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:46.460
 So when it was published, I think it was actually published in the UK, maybe just before America,

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:51.300
 because there were weird copyright in quirk, that, um, they wanted to avoid piracy.

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.300
 Yeah.

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:53.300
 Exactly.

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:58.500
 Um, but it was printed in the UK first, but the UK publishers were kind of a combination

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.180
 of really careless and really prudish.

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:04.580
 They cut huge tracks of it out and also they cut out the epilogue.

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:07.980
 And I should say if you haven't read Moby Dick and you don't want a spoiler, then fast

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:13.180
 forward, like the next 15 seconds of this, but, oh, I put my hands on my ears, but I've

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:14.180
 got cancer.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.180
 It's just going to make the sound more intense.

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:17.180
 Yeah.

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:21.780
 And also, when James says cans, he doesn't mean actual cans on his head, so I'm wearing headphones.

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:24.620
 I'm wearing the southern French city of Canada.

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:29.900
 Anyone who tuned out will be tuning back in right around now.

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:32.700
 Go away for five minutes and then come back.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:38.620
 Disappear, go make a cup of tea. Um, basically, the epilogue is a crucial part of Moby Dick,

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:43.740
 because it's narrated by famously by Ishmael, hence call me Ishmael, being that famous line.

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:48.860
 But, uh, at the sort of apparent end of Moby Dick, then the ship goes down, everyone dies.

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:52.500
 It's only in the epilogue that it's explained that Ishmael has survived.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:56.220
 So that was cut out and it got terrible reviews in Britain, because all the reviewers said,

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:59.380
 "Well, it doesn't make any sense how the hell is this story being narrated by someone

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:01.140
 who clearly died at the end of the book?"

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:02.820
 Yeah, the ghost of Ishmael.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:03.820
 Yeah.

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:10.340
 The reviews were so bad, so I read about a few of them, um, one review in the Boston Post said,

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:15.300
 "We have read nearly one half of this book and are satisfied that the London Athenaeum

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:19.060
 is right in calling it an ill-compounded mixture of romance and matter effect."

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:23.180
 And the spectator said, "Nothing should be introduced into a novel which it is physically

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:26.660
 impossible for the writer to have known, thus he must not describe the conversation of

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:28.940
 miners in a pit if they all perish."

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:31.620
 So that was exactly that problem that you mentioned about it, yeah.

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:32.780
 And it killed his career.

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:37.540
 Yeah, he had a terrible career as an author for someone who's a household name.

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:41.380
 It's all 315 copies, and he then just gave up.

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:45.380
 But actually it didn't become popular, I think, until relatively recently, is that right?

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:50.820
 I think it was the 1950s, because the British flawed edition remained the most commonly

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:54.900
 read one for so long, and it was only when, like, the seminal text was published, and

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:58.140
 I think the 50s that people suddenly went, "Ah, this is quite good now that it makes sense."

00:12:58.140 --> 00:12:59.140
 Yeah.

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:00.540
 And his other stuff sounds really interesting.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:05.700
 He wrote a book called The Confidence Man, and it's a book which is all about a con man

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:07.020
 who fools people.

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:11.760
 It's set on one single day, and I think it's known to be the first book ever to just be

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.180
 set in a single day.

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:17.980
 And that day happens to be April Fool's Day, because he's conning someone, and the book

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:22.140
 itself was released on April Fool's Day to tie in with that.

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:26.100
 Just one other thing as well, that Herman Melville, in what he's written, is he wrote what

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:30.020
 is said to be the longest poem in American literature.

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:31.700
 It's almost 18,000 lines.

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:33.700
 Are you going to read it for us now?

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:38.500
 If you want to fast forward it, hold it for a little bit, three hours.

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:39.500
 What's it about?

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:42.940
 It's a poem and pilgrimage in the Holy Land.

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:43.940
 Oh, okay.

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:44.940
 Yeah.

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:45.940
 Yeah.

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:46.940
 Sounds great.

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:47.940
 On very old things.

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:48.940
 Oh, yeah.

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:49.940
 This was in the news this year.

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:55.020
 I'm not sure if it's true, but it has been claimed that some Russian scientists have

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:59.580
 found an extinct lion cub underneath the snow in Siberia.

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:05.100
 And inside that lion cub, they found two nematode worms, which must be at least 40,000 years

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:08.140
 old, and they brought them back to life.

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:13.380
 So there are two 40,000 year old worms currently living in Russia.

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.380
 They came over to Salisbury for two days.

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:16.380
 Not for that.

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:18.340
 I mean, isn't that amazing?

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:19.340
 That is amazing.

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:20.340
 Wait, so they were...

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:21.340
 Sorry.

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:22.340
 What?

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:23.340
 So how did they bring them back to life?

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:24.340
 40,000 years ago.

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:25.340
 Yeah.

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:28.580
 These worms were just happily living inside a rectum of a lion.

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:29.580
 Yeah.

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:30.580
 And then the lion died.

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.380
 And then it got frozen.

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:35.620
 And then they just kind of went into almost like a hibernation kind of thing.

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:42.020
 And when they defrosted them 40,000 years later, they just kind of, you on and off.

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:43.020
 And they're alive again.

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:45.140
 The Austin Powers of the world.

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:47.540
 They've been against none of the cultural references.

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:50.780
 It's going to be so difficult bringing them up to speed.

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:51.780
 It would be interesting.

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:56.820
 We'll never know, but to put a modern day of a species worm next to it and just...

00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:58.300
 See if they chat.

00:14:58.300 --> 00:14:59.300
 Just to know if that...

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:00.300
 See if they get up.

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:03.580
 Like, I would love to know how much has happened in the worm world.

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:06.100
 There would be enough of a difference in their conversation.

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.860
 I'd love to know what you think you would see.

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:09.860
 Yeah.

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:10.860
 Exactly.

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:12.860
 Because I'm telling you, it would be nothing.

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:16.060
 They're just going to sit next to each other for a bit.

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:17.860
 I wonder if they'd have sex with each other.

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:18.860
 Oh, yeah.

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:24.420
 Because there's an age difference, isn't there, and then there's like 40,000 year-age difference.

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:28.140
 Well, do you know that a very big age difference I found in nature, actually,

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:30.660
 is that between the world's oldest tortoise.

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:33.300
 So tortoises and other animals that lives a long time.

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:35.420
 And the oldest living one is Jonathan.

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:37.660
 He's 186 years old.

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:41.700
 And the girl that he's been trying to get off with is only 26.

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:44.820
 He's been trying to get off with her since 1991.

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:48.100
 The problem he might have been having is that they discovered last year.

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:50.700
 Frederica is actually most probably a male.

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:51.700
 Oh.

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:52.700
 Oh, sorry.

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:57.900
 You said, girl, I think you made a human woman that he was sort of infatuated with as a tortoise.

00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:58.900
 No, sorry.

00:15:58.900 --> 00:15:59.900
 No, sorry.

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:00.900
 You were a female tortoise.

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:01.900
 A girl tortoise, yes.

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:02.900
 Yeah.

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:05.620
 Turns out he's just been trying to mount another man, make babies.

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:06.620
 Which is fine.

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:07.620
 Of course.

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:08.620
 It's totally fine.

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:09.620
 It just won't make babies.

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:10.620
 No.

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:12.700
 And also, if you're a hundred and seventy odd years old, you're probably quite right-wing

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:13.700
 in your opinions.

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:18.780
 Do you think he's most certainly homophobic?

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:23.300
 I just say, at that age, I think people do get a bit like that, but they...

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:24.300
 I don't know.

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:26.300
 I think tortoises are more open-minded.

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:29.500
 I can't believe I was getting shit for talking about what worms would say to each other.

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:36.100
 You would just say tortoises are more open-minded.

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:44.340
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:49.540
 My fact this week is that the European Space Agency has a sound system so loud that if you

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:52.620
 heard it, it would kill you.

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:58.700
 Your head would explode is probably not what would happen.

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:01.260
 This is claimed by the ESA.

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:04.740
 They've said that they have this big sound system.

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:06.820
 Well, they definitely do have the sound system.

00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:07.820
 Definitely.

00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:08.820
 Yes, they have the sound system.

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:09.820
 It's in the Netherlands.

00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:14.460
 And it's the ESA's large European acoustic facility, otherwise known as LEAF.

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:16.580
 It's 16.4 meters tall.

00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:22.660
 It's 11 meters wide, 9 meters deep, and it uses nitrogen gas in order to make the sounds.

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:25.180
 And what they use it for is to test rockets.

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:29.880
 They smash sound into rockets to simulate what it might be like for when a rocket is

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:32.260
 exiting or re-entering Earth.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:36.060
 So what they've said is that if you were in this room and they closed their door and this

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:43.660
 was put on, that it could kill you, that's a bit disputed by I think every site I've read

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:44.660
 that talks about it.

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:46.260
 We're not sure that it could do that.

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:49.580
 It only gets up to, I believe, 154 decibels.

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:54.060
 Most scientists believe that 154 decibels probably will boast your ear drums, it will cause

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:58.380
 pain, but it won't explode your head in the way that perhaps they're suggesting.

00:17:58.380 --> 00:17:59.380
 But it won't be pleasant.

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:00.380
 It won't be pleasant.

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:03.820
 Especially depends what kind of music it is as well, don't forget.

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:05.820
 Yeah, do we know what kind of music they play to the rockets?

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:06.820
 Well, I read it.

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:07.820
 I read it.

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:10.660
 No, it's just sound, unfortunately, as in...

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:11.660
 Well, sorry, grab that.

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:14.940
 The music they say, "No, it's just sound."

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:18.620
 You and Jonathan, the talk just ain't funny.

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:23.060
 Well, one guy who was interviewed about it who works there says that they do, you know,

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:26.820
 you plug an iPod in and he would love to play rock music, whatever, but actually it's

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:28.900
 just a bunch of noise.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:34.780
 And so basically with what sound waves are, it's molecules in the air and they're kind

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:37.900
 of getting closer together and further apart, closer together and further apart, so it's

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:39.260
 a change in pressure.

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:42.860
 So if you make a sound loud enough, there'll be a big enough change in pressure that it

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:44.460
 would definitely kill you, in my opinion.

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:45.460
 Wow.

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:46.460
 I'm pretty sure it would.

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:49.900
 It would probably explode your lungs, but I don't see any reason why it couldn't explode

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:50.900
 your head as well.

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:51.900
 Wow.

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:55.980
 I think sound waves become a shock wave, basically, at a certain point, effectively,

00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:01.980
 and they're about 190, where it's then like the, you know, the shock wave that makes a big

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:04.140
 sonic boom.

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:08.140
 But yeah, they apparently also, it doesn't have to be sounds that you can hear.

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:14.660
 So there's infrasound, which is sounds that are out of the range of human hearing frequencies.

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:19.340
 And people have found that if you expose humans to infrasounds that are over 100 decibels,

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:22.860
 they have blood pressure and respiratory rate changes that they can't control.

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:25.020
 They just feel their breathing changing.

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:29.340
 And if you take the decibel level high enough, even though they can't even hear the sound,

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:31.580
 their lungs will deflate and inflate.

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:36.580
 So it can be used as a means of like artificial respiration if you play this inaudible sound.

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:37.580
 It's amazing.

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:38.580
 That's so weird.

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:43.820
 So any of these things, loudness is basically how big the amplitude and whatever it is.

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:47.340
 So it could be really, really, really, really loud, but you still can't hear it because

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:48.820
 it's below, say, 60 Hz.

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:49.820
 Yeah, right.

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:53.900
 And that, to me, that just blows my mind a little bit because how something can be really

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:55.180
 loud, but you can't hear it.

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:56.180
 That just doesn't make any sense.

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:57.180
 It's astonishing.

00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:59.220
 Well, I don't like it because it can affect you.

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:02.420
 Who knows what sounds are being played right now that are screwing with our brains?

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:03.420
 No.

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:04.420
 Well, that's what they thought, didn't they?

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:06.900
 In the American Embassy in Cuba or something?

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:07.900
 Yeah.

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:09.220
 So everyone's feeling sick.

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:12.260
 And they thought maybe there's some infrasound kind of weapon they were using.

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:14.380
 I think probably we think that isn't true, right?

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:16.340
 I don't think they could work in fear it.

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:17.580
 They've not decided one way or the other.

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:19.780
 Or they certainly haven't said if they have.

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:21.740
 So loud noise also causes heart disease.

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:22.740
 Really?

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:23.740
 Yeah.

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:25.220
 So it's really strange.

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:27.220
 It induces a stress response.

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:33.420
 It disrupts your body at a cellular level and it induces a kind of fight or flight response.

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:37.980
 So when the stress hormones increase, that can lead to vascular damage.

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:42.780
 And this happens even if you're asleep, a loud noise will increase your blood pressure.

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:43.780
 Wow.

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:44.780
 So it's kind of the same.

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:48.660
 Even if you're not hearing it consciously, it just affects the body.

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:49.660
 Yeah.

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:55.220
 And every time I've ever walked into a club, I immediately want to run away as fast.

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:56.220
 That will be it.

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:57.220
 That will be possible.

00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:01.100
 Did you know the scientists have only just discovered why cocks don't deffin themselves?

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:02.100
 Cockrels.

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:03.100
 Roles.

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:04.100
 Cockrels?

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:05.100
 Let's call them roosters.

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:08.780
 So roosters crow at over 100 decibels, which is extremely loud.

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:10.940
 It's the same as running a chainsaw right next to your ear.

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:11.940
 Wow.

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:14.220
 And we didn't know why they don't just go deaf, why the eardrums don't explode.

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:16.220
 And they've looked into them and there are a couple of reasons.

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:19.460
 So they've got an eardrum that's surrounded by a nice soft squishy tissue.

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:24.020
 But also, when they tilt their head back to start crowing, then they've got this little

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:28.300
 flap of material which drops down and covers their ear canal completely.

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:30.100
 So they've got their own built-in ear plug.

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:31.100
 Oh my god.

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:35.540
 Do you remember those dolls that you would get as a kid and as you sat it up, the eyes open

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:37.700
 and then the way you lay them, the same fingers.

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:38.940
 Yeah, it's exactly the same thing.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:39.940
 The same technology.

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:40.940
 Yeah.

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:41.940
 Wow.

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:42.940
 That is amazing.

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:43.940
 It's cool.

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:46.700
 It's like being able to stick your fingers in your ears if you don't have fingers.

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:52.940
 It's like having a finger inside your ear that you could just kind of maneuver it inside

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:54.780
 the ear and stick it in the little canal.

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:55.780
 It's exactly like that.

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:59.940
 Hey, you know that song "Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution" by AC/DC?

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:00.940
 No.

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:01.940
 It's track 10 on Back and Black.

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:04.100
 It's one of the more famous songs.

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:05.100
 It's a very good one.

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:06.100
 Sing it for us.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:07.100
 No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:08.100
 We're not allowed.

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:09.100
 For legal reasons.

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:10.100
 For legal reasons.

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:11.100
 For legal reasons.

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:12.100
 For legal reasons.

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:13.100
 For legal reasons.

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:14.100
 For legal reasons.

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:15.100
 The lyrics are "Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution".

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:16.100
 Okay.

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:20.700
 The Mississippi State University, who recently tested whether or not "Rock and Roll" is

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:23.700
 or "Ain't Noise Pollution" to aphids.

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:24.700
 Piss!

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:25.700
 No, sorry.

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:26.700
 To beetles.

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:27.700
 To beetles.

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:30.540
 They played rock two beetles.

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:32.380
 There's a beetle called Lady Beetles.

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:34.300
 They're living fields and they play on aphids.

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:40.020
 And the scientists played AC/DC at them quite loud, along with some other music.

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:44.180
 And they found that when it was country and folk music, the beetles didn't mind.

00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:49.540
 But when it was AC/DC, specifically back in black, the number of aphids they caught was

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:51.540
 cut in half.

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:56.020
 And the aphid population rocketed and then the plants in the field were 25% smaller.

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:58.980
 So it has a big impact on farming, basically.

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:03.780
 So they have concluded, they said, as fans of AC/DC, we sadly must disagree with the band

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:07.780
 and conclude that "Rock and Roll" is "Noise Pollution" for beetles.

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:08.780
 That's so weird.

00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:10.780
 I find that so weird.

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:11.780
 Do you?

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:17.860
 Because I think AC/DC is melodic, as much as we're about to get into the argument about

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:20.620
 whether it's metal or rock.

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:22.860
 No, I just find that a bit odd.

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:26.300
 Yeah, but we don't know what's making them stop eating the aphids.

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:28.820
 It might be that they're enjoying the music so much.

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:31.820
 They're just kind of bopping around and they don't have time to do that.

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:34.220
 Yeah, or they've gone off to buy the CD or something.

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:35.540
 That's possible.

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:43.580
 Just speaking of music, metal, Metallica this year has released a whiskey.

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:47.900
 So they're like growing a number of bands that are releasing their own alcohols.

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:52.020
 They've gone for whiskey, but the way that they are distilling the whiskey, the distilling

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:55.020
 process, is they are playing heavy metal to the whiskey.

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:56.020
 Right.

00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:57.020
 It's very cool.

00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:02.140
 So it's a process that then they're calling black noise and the idea is it's shaping

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:03.460
 the whiskey's flavor.

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:10.020
 So they play Metallica's music through a subwoofer and they disrupt the whiskey inside the barrel.

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:14.540
 So it's sort of just getting mixed up and mixed up and it's a molecular level of infusion

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:15.540
 going on.

00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:17.180
 Yeah, what is absolute bullshit.

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:18.180
 No, no, no, no.

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:21.500
 I think they do this all the time to whiskey, don't they?

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:22.500
 There's always they are.

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:23.820
 This one's been at the bottom of the sea.

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:24.820
 Yeah.

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:25.820
 This one's been in space.

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:29.380
 This one's like, can they not just make nice whiskey that people want to buy?

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:30.380
 It's good.

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:32.980
 Listen, I'm getting this from a very, very good source.

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:36.900
 This is the press release released by the band.

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:42.180
 And yeah, it it's increased wood interaction that kicks up the wood flavor characteristics

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:43.180
 in the whiskey.

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:44.180
 I don't know what that means.

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:45.180
 I don't know where the wood bit came in.

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:46.180
 The wood comes from the barrel.

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:47.180
 For the barrels.

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:48.180
 For the barrels.

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:52.220
 The whole point is that the wood you use in the barrels sort of reacts with the spirit.

00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:55.420
 That's where the taste comes from whiskey, the barrels.

00:24:55.420 --> 00:25:00.260
 As in they put tasteless alcohol in there and then it's in the barrels for 25 years and

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:03.980
 it seeps in all the flavor from the wood and that's where the whiskey plays the sweet.

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:05.980
 Is it 25 years for you?

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:06.980
 It's over.

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:09.980
 That's just a six week whiskey.

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:12.460
 And it just gives it a quick dip.

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:13.460
 It just gives it a quick dip.

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:14.460
 It just gives it a quick dip.

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:15.460
 It just gives it a quick dip.

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:16.460
 It just gives it a quick dip.

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:17.460
 It just gives it a quick dip.

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:18.460
 It just gives it a quick dip.

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:19.460
 It just gives it a quick dip.

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:20.460
 It just gives it a quick dip.

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:21.460
 It just gives it a quick dip.

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:22.460
 It just gives it a quick dip.

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:23.460
 It just gives it a quick dip.

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:24.460
 It just gives it a quick dip.

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:25.460
 It just gives it a quick dip.

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:26.460
 It just gives it a quick dip.

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:27.460
 It just gives it a quick dip.

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:28.460
 It just gives it a quick dip.

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:29.460
 It just gives it a quick dip.

00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:30.460
 It just gives it a quick dip.

00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:31.460
 It just gives it a quick dip.

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:32.460
 It just gives it a quick dip.

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:33.460
 It just gives it a quick dip.

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:34.460
 It just gives it a quick dip.

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:35.460

 It just gives it a quick dip.

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:10.460

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:14.460
 It just gives it a quick dip.

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:15.460

 It just gives it a quick dip.

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:41.460
 It just gives it a quick dip.

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:42.460
 It just gives it a quick dip.

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:43.460
 It just gives it a quick dip.

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:44.460
 It just gives it a quick dip.

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:45.460
 It just gives it a quick dip.

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:46.460
 It just gives it a quick dip.

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:47.460
 It just gives it a quick dip.

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:48.460
 It just gives it a quick dip.

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:49.460
 It just gives it a quick dip.

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:50.460
 It just gives it a quick dip.

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:51.460
 It just gives it a quick dip.

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:52.460
 It just gives it a quick dip.

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:53.460
 It just gives it a quick dip.

00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:54.460
 It just gives it a quick dip.

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:55.460
 It just gives it a quick dip.

00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:56.460
 It just gives it a quick dip.

00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:57.460
 Is that right?

00:26:57.460 --> 00:26:58.460
 Is that right?

00:26:58.460 --> 00:26:59.460
 That is...

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:00.460
 I mean, it's not a million miles from what I get.

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:01.460
 Well, there you go.

00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:02.460
 You're the healthiest.

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:07.460
 It followed 500,000 people over a 10-year period and then looked at who had died at the end of it.

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:12.460
 And it found that you reduced your chance of death by 14% of your drinking eight plus cups

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:16.460
 of coffee and by 16% if you drink seven cups of coffee a day.

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:20.460
 Is it the caffeine that's the good ingredient or is it coffee in general?

00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:20.460
 Is it the good ingredient or is it coffee in general?

00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:21.460
 Is it the good ingredient or is it coffee in general?

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:22.460
 Is it the good ingredient or is it coffee in general?

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:23.460
 Is it the good ingredient or is it coffee in general?

00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:24.460
 Is it the good ingredient or is it coffee in general?

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:25.460
 Is it the good ingredient or is it coffee in general?

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:26.460
 Is it the normal coffee?

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:27.460
 Would they still be healthy?

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:28.460
 And there's no hope here.

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:29.460
 Sorry.

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:33.460
 No, they don't know because it's just a statistical study.

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:34.460
 It's not a biological study as it was.

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:36.460
 They've just looked at who's dead.

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:37.460
 Right.

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:40.460
 But they've adjusted for other factors as in it could be...

00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:41.460
 Yes.

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:45.460
 I'm sure they've done all the stuff that scientists are meant to do, like a chance for other mitigating

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:46.460
 factors.

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:48.460
 One would hope.

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:50.460
 South Korean schools aren't the only place to abandon coffee.

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:51.460
 Go on.

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:52.460
 Bit of a history.

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:54.460
 All of Sweden did in 1746.

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:55.460
 Wow.

00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:56.460
 Yeah.

00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:57.460
 This was very interesting.

00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:01.300
 They banned coffee and it was banned by King Gustav III.

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:04.820
 And it was banned because they just thought that it was very bad for your health.

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:09.360
 So what he wanted to do was ban it and then experiment on it to see whether or not he was

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:13.060
 right in his belief or whether or not his advisors who told him that were right in their

00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:14.060
 belief.

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:18.340
 So what they did was they started giving it to convicted criminals to test to see whether

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:22.820
 if they drunk coffee all day, every day or at least, you know, they all ended up being

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:23.820
 beheaded.

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:24.820
 So it was included.

00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:25.820
 Very bad for you.

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:28.380
 Well, here's the thing.

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:31.480
 The King ordered an experiment to be done on two identical twins.

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:36.060
 They were both on death row, but they were both put just for life imprisonment if they

00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:39.020
 went and did this because they wanted to see how long it could last.

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:42.460
 So one was given coffee every day and the other one was given tea.

00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:46.260
 And unfortunately, Gustav III died before the experiment finished.

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:48.980
 He was having energy drinks every day, wasn't he?

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:49.980
 Yes.

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:50.980
 Exactly.

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:51.980
 Yeah.

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:54.740
 No, he was assassinated in 1792.

00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:55.740
 Sorry.

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:56.740
 Sorry, guys.

00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:57.740
 Too soon.

00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:58.740
 Too soon.

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:01.460
 But yeah, we don't fully know what happened.

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:07.540
 Well, no, the really great thing was that so the two doctors were assigned to study the patients,

00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:12.820
 one doctor each, but both the doctors and King Gustav all died before either the tea drinker

00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:13.820
 or the coffee drinker.

00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:14.820
 Yeah.

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:15.820
 Great.

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:19.220
 I've read an account saying that the tea drinker died first and that the solitary coffee

00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:23.820
 drinker, who was meant to be living this unhealthy, life-start drinking coffee, lived longest

00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:24.820
 of all of them.

00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:27.340
 I think there is a question that it's a pocketful tale though.

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:28.860
 I mean, it sounds so neat.

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:29.860
 Yeah.

00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:30.860
 Yeah.

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:31.860
 I found somewhere else where it was banned.

00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:32.860
 Gone.

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:34.020
 This is in the Ottoman Empire.

00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:40.060
 So there were lots, so it's basically originated for the first time in Yemen in the 15th century,

00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:42.500
 as in grinding the beans, mixing with liquid.

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:46.460
 There have been various other attempts to use caffeine beans before that.

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:50.020
 Yemen is, or modern day Yemen, I guess, is where it first appeared.

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:51.300
 Same as India's ad.

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:52.300
 Really?

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:53.300
 Is he from Yemen?

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:54.300
 Yeah, he is.

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:55.300
 He was born there, wasn't he?

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:56.300
 Yeah.

00:29:56.300 --> 00:30:01.380
 Well, I thought that might go somewhere different, so.

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:06.100
 He then moved to Bexhillon Sea, which is where comedians like Milligan and those stations

00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:09.900
 are ensuring the early bit of the Second World War.

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:10.900
 Where is that, Bexhillon Sea?

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:12.620
 Bexhillon Sea is just near.

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:13.620
 It's on the coast.

00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:15.140
 It's sort of, you can see France in the distance.

00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:16.140
 Oh, on the South Coast.

00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:17.820
 Wow, there's some really nice towns here.

00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:18.820
 Unbelievable.

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:20.180
 I've got some stuff here.

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:26.060
 Thank you about Yemen, where he is, I'm trying to say.

00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:32.540
 So basically, it became really popular because it was very delicious, but also it was seen

00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:36.580
 as quite dangerous, quite political, because you'd have a coffee house, which is where people

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:39.620
 meet and they can discuss, and they can discuss politics.

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:43.620
 So it's not like meeting at a mosque where things are a bit more police than you're only

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:45.140
 there for religious purposes.

00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:50.100
 So it's a secular space, and also the coffee was brewed for 20 minutes and it was served

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:54.740
 very, very hot, so you could only drink it in tiny sips, so you kind of have to chat.

00:30:54.740 --> 00:31:00.540
 So the Ottoman Sultan in 1633 cracked down on it, and this is supposedly true, that he

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:05.340
 walked around Istanbul in disguise with a big sword ready to behead anybody he found drinking

00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:06.340
 coffee.

00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:07.340
 Is that right?

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:09.820
 Well, this is the story, and again, it may well be apocryphal.

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:11.660
 I love the detail of a big sword.

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:17.540
 He wasn't turning no fruit knife around.

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:24.860
 It was banned by Frederick the Great, 1781, because he thought that people should be taking

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:27.740
 beer instead of beer gruel instead of coffee.

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:30.060
 He thought it was a bit of a luxury.

00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:31.060
 Beer gruel.

00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:34.820
 Beer gruel would be like the porridgey stuff that you get at the bottom when you've been

00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:36.500
 brewing beer.

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:39.220
 And he was brought up on that and he thought other people should be having that.

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:42.860
 They shouldn't be having this luxurious stuff from Yemen.

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:47.740
 But he actually did himself have coffee, although the difference was he bowled his with instead

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:48.740
 of water champagne.

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:49.740
 Yeah.

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:50.740
 Wow.

00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:51.740
 Oh.

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:52.740
 That's way to have it.

00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:53.740
 Would that be nice?

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:54.740
 Would it?

00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:55.740
 Yeah.

00:31:55.740 --> 00:32:00.740
 I think after the fourth or fifth cup, you start to enjoy it a bit more.

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:09.020
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show.

00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:11.300
 And that is Chazinski.

00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:16.940
 My fact this week is that facial recognition technology for chickens allows you to pre-order

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:22.580
 a specific chicken and watch it grow on the farm before it ends up on your plate.

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:23.780
 It's actually quite nice.

00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:28.220
 This is a technology that's just being patented and developed in China.

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:31.180
 And it's to make sure that your chicken is totally free range.

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:34.460
 And they've developed really advanced facial recognition technology for chickens, which

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:38.420
 is about, you know, late '90s percent accuracy.

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:40.220
 And so you pre-order your chicken.

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:44.580
 And then I guess four to six months later, once it's waddled about on its nice free range

00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:48.740
 farm for a while, and you've been able to check it every once in a while, then you get

00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:49.740
 to eat it.

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:50.740
 You check in on it.

00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:51.740
 Check, check.

00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:52.740
 You check.

00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:53.740
 You check in on it.

00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:57.420
 Well, yeah, facial recognition is going to be everywhere, isn't it?

00:32:57.420 --> 00:33:01.220
 Well, the technology seems, yeah, really advanced in some areas and really crap in others.

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:06.860
 For instance, there was the trial at the 2017 Champions League final in Cardiff, where

00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:10.500
 it was revealed that it'd wrongly identified more than 2,000 people.

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:16.700
 So the technology flagged up 2,470 people as potential criminals by comparing them to a

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:18.420
 database of potential criminals.

00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:22.700
 It turned out 2,297 of those flags were false positives.

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:24.740
 Well, it's still sub-positive, though.

00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:25.740
 Some positives.

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:30.940
 I think the police at the moment have a 98% false positive rate for their facial recognition

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:31.940
 technology.

00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:35.940
 No, but those, the South Wales police, they've been improving that technology since the

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:36.940
 Champions League final.

00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:42.020
 I think they switched to a new algorithm and at a recent event, they only got 10 false

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:46.420
 positives, which was 0.02% of the total number of matches.

00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:47.420
 I'm skeptical.

00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:50.220
 So I went to an exhibition last night at Somerset House.

00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:51.500
 It's really good.

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:55.300
 It's basically a massive design exhibition that's taken over the whole thing.

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:56.660
 It's on for a few weeks.

00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:59.940
 Each country has its own room and design piece.

00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:03.180
 And the American one was testing facial recognition.

00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:08.780
 So I had a go and it asks you to sit in a chair and it scans your face and it does lots of,

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:12.100
 you know, investigating your face, everything about it, and then tells you how old it thinks

00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:14.900
 you are, whether you're male or female, all that kind of thing.

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:18.420
 And you're skeptical about this because I think you're a hundred and seventy-five-year-old

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:19.420
 tartarist.

00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:20.420
 Oh, yeah.

00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:26.460
 It wasn't quite that wrong, but it asked me to try and look really angry.

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:27.460
 And so I did.

00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:28.460
 I tried really hard.

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:29.460
 You know, I put loads of angry faces.

00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:30.460
 I see those faces.

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:31.460
 I see those faces.

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:32.460
 You've all seen those faces a lot.

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:35.300
 Give us a fake, angry face that you were giving it.

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:36.300
 Oh, that.

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:43.180
 To me, it's screaming constipation.

00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:52.300
 But basically, then, I guess what expression I was trying to do, and it said calm, and then

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:53.300
 it gets my age.

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:55.620
 And I was there with my friend.

00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:56.620
 She did it and I did it.

00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:57.620
 It said it.

00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:02.060
 It thought I was a female age 15 to 20, which is extremely flashing, but I'm not the kind

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:03.060
 of person.

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:05.980
 I mean, no one has wrinkles between 15 and 20.

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:07.300
 Why can't it spot that?

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:11.220
 And it said my poor friend was a female age 55 to 65.

00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:12.900
 Who's my age?

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:16.380
 So I think the average they got it right.

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:17.380
 Pretty much.

00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:18.380
 Right.

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:20.380
 Is that what they're going for?

00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:23.500
 In Finland, they're testing a new technology.

00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:27.860
 So the idea is that when you walk into a shop, they're developing scanners that when you

00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:33.020
 walk in up to the till, you give a meaningful nod, as it says in the quotes, that's how they've

00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:37.060
 said in this video, you give a meaningful nod to the scanner, and that's how you pay.

00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:41.300
 And it's memorized through, in the same way, with your bank card details, your face is

00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:42.300
 going on.

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:43.300
 Creepy, creepy, creepy, creepy.

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:44.300
 Yeah.

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:47.100
 I am going to trick all this facial recognition stuff, and I found out a method I can do.

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:49.500
 I deliberately disfiguring your own face.

00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:50.500
 That's right.

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:55.900
 So it turns out that you can't trick good facial recognition systems by wearing makeup.

00:35:55.900 --> 00:36:00.020
 Even if you're wearing weird goth style makeup, it doesn't work.

00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:04.180
 But there is a guy online, and his name is Taki on, that's his Twitter account, he has

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:12.500
 found that the kind of makeup worn by fans of the insane clown posse, aka Juggalos, right?

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:18.020
 They wear very heavy clown makeup, and it completely redefines what the computer sees

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:19.540
 as your jawline.

00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:24.460
 So we may still see people wearing clown masks for bank robberies, but they'll just be

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:26.780
 wearing clown makeup instead.

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:27.820
 That's very clever.

00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:28.820
 Oh.

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:29.820
 But they tried to train them up, didn't they?

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:35.340
 Recently, I think you mentioned fleetingly in a podcast a few months ago, Andy, that the

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:42.460
 South Wales Police sent facial recognition AI to a massive Elvis impersonator festival,

00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:46.500
 the biggest one in the world, in order to hone its techniques to see if it could distinguish

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:47.980
 between different Elvis impersonators.

00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:52.780
 Oh, speaking of Elvis, I've been reading up on him recently.

00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:57.900
 I was reading this one article that was published on the enemy, and it's one of those things

00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:01.580
 that we don't usually naturally go to when we're doing our research, you know, something

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:07.260
 that's like 101 amazing things that you'll, but this article called 75 geeky facts you

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:09.020
 might not know about Elvis Presley.

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:12.220
 And it was genuinely incredible every time I give this one.

00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:13.820
 Okay, here's one.

00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:18.660
 The inspiration for Elvis Presley's trademark jumpsuit and quiff look was a comic book hero

00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:23.300
 Captain Marvel Jr. is what inspired Elvis Presley's look.

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:28.700
 This is the geekiest foundations for what it seemed to be the coolest singer of the 1950s

00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:31.460
 and so did he say that was, did he used to read them?

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:35.460
 He must have, as a kid, yeah, he was obsessed with them, I believe, when he was younger.

00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:38.060
 And so that's what he based his look on.

00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:42.620
 Here's another one just before he died, Elvis commissioned his stage electrician to design

00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:46.700
 a version of his big white jumpsuit that he wore, which would fire laser beams into

00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:49.120
 the audience from the suit.

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:50.120
 I mean, that's incredible.

00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:51.120
 I've not heard that before.

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:52.820
 Do you know Elvis?

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:54.900
 He, Elvis impersonators.

00:37:54.900 --> 00:38:00.740
 Do you know the first Elvis impersonator was in 1954, which is two years before Elvis's

00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:01.740
 first hit single?

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:02.740
 What?

00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:06.300
 This guy was called Carl Cheesy Nelson.

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:07.300
 That is.

00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:08.300
 Cheesy.

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:09.300
 Cheesy.

00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:10.300
 It was his nickname.

00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:11.300
 That was his middle name.

00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:12.300
 Okay.

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:17.580
 And basically, what had happened was Elvis had been delayed for a show and this guy was

00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:18.940
 a really good friend of Elvis.

00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:22.540
 And so he did the whole show just copying his entire style.

00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:23.540
 That's so cool.

00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:24.540
 So, yeah, that's amazing.

00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:25.540
 That's amazing.

00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:26.540
 That's so funny.

00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:31.260
 Just while we're on impersonators, and again, from this NME article, really fascinating.

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:36.060
 In Somalia, going to strict Islamic law, Elvis impersonators are required to have beards.

00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:37.060
 Right.

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:38.060
 So you can do everything.

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:40.340
 And I'm reading these facts word for word, I should say.

00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:42.460
 It's such a brilliant article.

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:45.340
 Just one more thing I found really interesting about facial recognition.

00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:46.340
 Oh, yeah.

00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:50.740
 Do you know that shops in London have it specifically for celebrities?

00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:55.980
 So a bunch of stores in London, more than a dozen stores in 2013, installed this technology,

00:38:55.980 --> 00:39:01.140
 which is VIP facial recognition technology, to stop that moment when someone super famous

00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:02.140
 walks in.

00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:06.180
 And as a shop assistant, you're supposed to be really kind of nice and sequest to them,

00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:07.620
 but you don't know who they are.

00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:12.340
 So it has a database of all celebrities' faces, and as soon as a celebrity walks in, then

00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:16.380
 a thing pops up on these guys' tills that says, "Oh, Julia Roberts has just entered the

00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:17.380
 building."

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:21.340
 And also with a bit of info about her, like, she is this size, and she likes this style of

00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:24.420
 thing, and go and force her to buy some shit.

00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:29.700
 If only Hugh Grant had had that in Notting Hill when Julia Roberts walked into his bookshop.

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:30.700
 Oh, if only.

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:32.500
 They could have done the whole film in half an hour.

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:33.500
 You're so right.

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:38.340
 And he would have sold her a book she actually wanted to buy, because it would have had a preferences.

00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:40.620
 I have a thing about facial recognition and celebrities.

00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:42.340
 This is weirdly similar to that.

00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:50.260
 So still on the tricking facial recognition thing, there are specially designed glasses

00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:55.340
 which can make facial recognition computers think that you are Miller Yovervitch.

00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:56.340
 Who?

00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:57.340
 Miller Yovervitch?

00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:58.340
 Yeah, Miller Yovervitch.

00:39:58.340 --> 00:39:59.340
 She's in the fifth element.

00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:04.460
 She's a model slash actor, resident, she's in all six of the resident evil movies, and

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:06.540
 she does a brilliant job at them.

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:08.540
 So they only tell you when it's her?

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:09.540
 No, no, no.

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:13.020
 They make the computer think that you are Miller Yovervitch.

00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:14.020
 Got it.

00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:15.020
 So it's really bizarre.

00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:18.980
 They've got, they can be made up to look like normal tortoise glasses, but on the front

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:23.020
 of the rims, they've got these specially printed images, okay?

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:27.700
 And the frames kind of overlay the face with pixels.

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:31.580
 And when the computer looks at you, it's calculations are disturbed and it thinks that you are

00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:34.060
 someone else in its database.

00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:35.380
 And I think there are limits.

00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:39.740
 As in I think you, you might have to be a woman, for example, with that, with a slightly

00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:43.540
 different bone structure, or you might need to be white as Miller Yovervitch.

00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:50.020
 Do you think wholesale people might start robbing banks, looking like Miller Yovervitch?

00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:51.020
 What an idea.

00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:52.020
 Yeah.

00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:53.740
 And then she's just going to get arrested, obviously.

00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:54.740
 Yeah.

00:40:54.740 --> 00:41:04.660
 Just be her in the insane clown posse in prison.

00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:05.660
 Okay.

00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:06.660
 That is it.

00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:07.660
 That is all of our facts.

00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:08.660
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:11.460

 No such thing as a fish.com.

 We have everything up there.

00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:36.380
 All of our previous episodes linked to our upcoming tour in 2019.

 We have links to our new book, which is coming out very soon.

00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:44.620
 And we just want to also say very quickly a thank you to 2020 audio for allowing us to record

00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:45.620
 here today.

00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:50.060
 Also a massive thank you to Ruben, who's next door right now, recording this for us.

00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:53.380
 He did our audio book, he's awesome, and he's a DJ.

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:57.460
 So go find him on what's your @Ruben, do you have a Twitter app?

00:41:57.460 --> 00:41:58.460
 @Rubiconuk.

00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:01.860
 Okay, that's it, we'll be back again next week.

 We'll see you then.

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:02.860
 Goodbye.
