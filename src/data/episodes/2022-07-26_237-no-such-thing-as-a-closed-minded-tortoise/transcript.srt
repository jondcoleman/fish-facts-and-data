1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,120
 No one is coming to you from 2020 Audio.

2
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,340
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin

3
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:32,140
 and Annotch is Innski and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our

4
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:37,940
 4th favorite facts from the last 7 days and in no particular order here we go.

5
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,540
 Sorry Dan, can I ask you who 2020 Audio is?

6
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,540
 Yes.

7
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:42,540
 I came out of nowhere a little bit.

8
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,540
 Yeah sorry about that.

9
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,980
 2020 Audio is where we are recording the audiobook for our Book of the Year which will

10
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:53,820
 be entitled "Audio Book of the Year" and we are in the very booth that it has been recorded.

11
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,820
 Yes.

12
00:00:54,820 --> 00:01:01,340
 The honour of being in the same booth as the no such thing as a fish team when they recorded

13
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:05,020
 the audio but not 1 hour ago.

14
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:09,020
 That author is, we are mere podcasters, such an honour.

15
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:13,180
 Okay, starting with fact number 1 and that is Andy.

16
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:19,620
 My fact is that there are whales alive today who were alive before Moby Dick was written.

17
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,620
 Wow.

18
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:24,940
 Does that mean so that book was written about a real whale?

19
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:25,940
 Yes.

20
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,940
 So might that whale still be alive?

21
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:28,940
 No.

22
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:35,820
 So because there are different kinds of whales there are particular whales which do live

23
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,180
 for at least 200 years.

24
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,180
 We know that but they are bow head whales and I think the whale and Moby Dick was a sperm

25
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,180
 whale.

26
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,180
 Yeah.

27
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,060
 So I don't know how long live sperm whales are actually.

28
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,060
 It is possible.

29
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,060
 Wow.

30
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,060
 There is a bow head.

31
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,060
 Sorry you said bow head whales.

32
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:54,380
 So bow head whales are they have got a life expectancy that can actually go up to 250 years

33
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,420
 I remember.

34
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:03,220
 So that would mean that not only were they alive longer then let's say the book itself

35
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:07,140
 Moby Dick was written but potentially there is one that is alive that was born the year

36
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,020
 that Herman Melville the author of Moby Dick was born.

37
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,020
 Oh wow.

38
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,740
 Yeah he wrote the book at 32 years old.

39
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,740
 Wow.

40
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,740
 And it was in 1851.

41
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,740
 Yes.

42
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:20,460
 And here is another thing the first New England Whalers so the first people from North America

43
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:26,740
 who were whaling around there they started in 1791 and that was 227 years ago.

44
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:31,380
 So there might be some whales alive who remember a time before whaling in that area of the

45
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,380
 world.

46
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,380
 Wow.

47
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:36,820
 Oh my god the time when they were free roaming the waters with no fear.

48
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,820
 Well this is the thing.

49
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:42,740
 So there was this massive bout of whaling in the Arctic especially between 1848 and 1915.

50
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:47,980
 So the bowhead whales in the Arctic all but about I think 1200 of them were killed 30 years

51
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,660
 ago they're only about 1200 left.

52
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:53,380
 So it's not like we have an individual we can definitely point to that whale and say that

53
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,860
 one was alive before Moby Dick.

54
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:02,060
 But they did find one recently which had a harpoon in it and they tested the age of the

55
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:08,860
 harpoon and they found it had only been manufactured between 1879 and 1885 that specific harpoon.

56
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:13,960
 So the whale was probably harpooned sometime from 1885 to 95 or it could be someone who

57
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:19,240
 just likes old harpoons like a modern day guy who's you know he's just using really old

58
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,240
 material.

59
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,180
 It could have been harpooned three years ago with an ancient harpoon supported off the day.

60
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,460
 But they reckon that that one that they found the harpoon and was 211 years old.

61
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,460
 So that's yeah.

62
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,740
 So basically these bowhead whales in particular are very very old.

63
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:36,020
 And it's one of the best ways to date them sometimes is when the harpoons came from because

64
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:41,260
 they're often found with harpoons in them embedded in their blubber, aren't they?

65
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:44,500
 But we should say with bowhead whales you were saying there were only about 1200 left.

66
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,340
 That was about 30, 30 years ago.

67
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,620
 And today there are 14,000 some good whale news.

68
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,620
 Oh, that was good.

69
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,020
 So that actually conservation is really worth.

70
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,020
 Wow.

71
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:58,380
 But yeah people used to harpoon a lot but whales can survive a huge amount of harpooning.

72
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:04,380
 So in fact the whale that Moby Dick was based on was a real life whale called Mocha Dick.

73
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:08,580
 You can see how a Melville really uses imagination when he switched names there.

74
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:13,900
 And Mocha Dick was a super famous whale in the 1830s, sort of terrorised boaters.

75
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,220
 And it was swim really calmly next to a wailing boat.

76
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,540
 But then at the first sign of aggression from the boat it would like attack the boat and

77
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,540
 tip people out.

78
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:24,860
 And when it finally died in 1839 it had 19 harpoons lodged in its side.

79
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,860
 Wow.

80
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,860
 There he is bits of harpoon.

81
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,860
 19.

82
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,860
 Wow.

83
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,660
 Because they get stuck in the blubber don't they?

84
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,660
 Yeah.

85
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,220
 And Mocha Dick was a sperm whale I think.

86
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:39,500
 Of the bowhead whales they have more blubber than anyone they have up to half a meter thick

87
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,500
 of blubber.

88
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,500
 Wow.

89
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,500
 That is a lot I think.

90
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,660
 You sort of body shaming the old bowhead a little bit aren't you?

91
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,700
 Well they're really weird animals aren't they?

92
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:54,220
 Because they've got a skull which is up to 40% of their body length.

93
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,340
 So the skull alone could be over five meters long.

94
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:01,580
 And the really weird thing about them is that they have the largest mouth of any living

95
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,580
 animal.

96
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,860
 But they have no teeth.

97
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,660
 Like large in terms of depth breath.

98
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,660
 I think volume.

99
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,660
 Volume.

100
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,660
 Yeah.

101
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,060
 So it's larger than a blue whale's mouth even though the bowhead is slightly smaller it's

102
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:17,860
 got such a massive head that I've read this fact about blue whales which I guess must

103
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,900
 be true about bowhead whales if it's true about blue whales which you might not be.

104
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:27,100
 But it is that the amount of water that a blue whale can fit in its mouth is heavier than

105
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,100
 a blue whale itself.

106
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,100
 What?

107
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,100
 Oh really?

108
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,100
 Yeah.

109
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,100
 That's plausible actually isn't it?

110
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,100
 Yeah.

111
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,420
 Are you going to say why don't they sink?

112
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,420
 No, I wasn't.

113
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:42,180
 I was going to say do they expand to a double blue whale size like a pufferfish?

114
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:45,580
 No it's about different densities so I guess water's more dense.

115
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,580
 Yeah.

116
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,620
 Then blubber especially because blubber's quite buoyant isn't it?

117
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,620
 Yeah.

118
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,220
 That's why women I think are often better at floating.

119
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,940
 This is actually only my subjective experience but I find it quite easy to swim and I'm

120
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,620
 often swimming with men who sink more easily and I think it's because women naturally

121
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,620
 have a bit more water fat.

122
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,180
 But you are going regularly harpoon to a little downside aren't you?

123
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:10,060
 I've got 14 harpoons in pale in my sight at this moment.

124
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:14,740
 I should just sorry just one more thing I learned about harpoons that I didn't know which

125
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:18,700
 I found out from that one that was discovered that was 130 years old.

126
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,100
 They had explosives in them which I didn't realise they did so they harpoon them and they

127
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,100
 were timed explosive.

128
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,340
 This is in the mid 19th century, timed explosive so they went inside and then they were

129
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:32,140
 timed to explode once in there.

130
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:35,820
 They didn't use harpoons to kill whales did they?

131
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:39,260
 That's you kill a whale with a lance or with a club or something like that.

132
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:43,260
 You use your harpoon to kind of catch it and then it kind of drags you along until it

133
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:46,700
 gets tired and then once it's tired you can kind of kill it with something else.

134
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,580
 I see.

135
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:53,540
 The bowhead whales, have we said before that they have giant penises in their heads?

136
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,540
 What?

137
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,100
 Well, sort of very penis equivalent thing.

138
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:02,660
 They have this massive ridge of tissue and it's called the corpus cavernosum axilaris.

139
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:07,540
 Now any latin or penis fans might remember that there is a thing in the human penis called

140
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:11,100
 the corpus cavernosum and that's the thing which fills with blood, those are the chambers

141
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,460
 which fill up and they do the same thing in the whale but they're to cool the whale down.

142
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:19,700
 So when the whale is swimming around and is getting really active there's a real risk

143
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,060
 that they'll overheat because they've got so much blood there they can get really hot

144
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:29,380
 really easily so they engorge this corpus cavernosum axilaris which means in the head with blood

145
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:33,620
 and then it opens its mouth, cold sea water flows in, cools the blood flows back out.

146
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,500
 So it's their way of cooling themselves down using this giant head penis.

147
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,900
 That's weird that they need to cool themselves down because they are found in cool water which

148
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,140
 is one of the reasons for their longevity, isn't it?

149
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:47,340
 Yeah, but they're constantly wearing a really thick coat basically and if you're trying

150
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:52,740
 to do anything in a thick coat or warm up, it is a bit like having a big coat all

151
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:58,620
 the time on a cold day but then whenever you want to cool down, get in an erection and pouring

152
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,620
 cold water into your butts and that's effectively what we're saying, isn't it?

153
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,260
 Yeah, it doesn't sound like a crazy way of cooling down.

154
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,260
 It does.

155
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,860
 I think people would call you crazy if you started doing that.

156
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,860
 Not on the bus.

157
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,860
 Not on the bus.

158
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:17,980
 Oh, I actually have a coat fact related to whales.

159
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:23,900
 Yeah, I love this. Some of the earliest waterproof jackets were made from whale intestines and

160
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,900
 it was the innuets who used to wear them because they are really waterproof.

161
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:31,340
 I was thinking intestines are full of water, bodily water, but very permeable because the

162
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:35,980
 nutrients have to permeate through them and so yeah, they would turn them into waterproof

163
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,980
 jackets.

164
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:37,980
 That is amazing.

165
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,580
 I don't really know what an intestine looks like but I imagine it's a bit like a puffer

166
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,620
 jacket because it's going to have lots of folds in it.

167
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,620
 You're right.

168
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,620
 All the folds.

169
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:49,060
 So, what would they do to preserve it so it doesn't rot?

170
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:52,140
 Oh, I guess they're keeping it on ice most of the time anyway.

171
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,580
 Yeah, that's a good point.

172
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,580
 That's a good point.

173
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,580
 If you dry it out, I guess.

174
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,580
 Don't know that.

175
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,580
 Oh, that's true.

176
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,580
 We wear leather clothes sometimes.

177
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,580
 Yeah.

178
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,580
 Just cure it.

179
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:06,060
 Yeah, cure it with urine, for instance, if you get cow hide and then you put a load of urine

180
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,420
 on it for ages and ages and ages, it'll get cured and it won't go rotten.

181
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,420
 This is very weird.

182
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:13,900
 I have another whale based clothing fact, which I didn't even realise and it's about

183
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,900
 Moby Dick too.

184
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:21,060
 So, there's a whole chapter in Moby Dick on the whale's penis and it's called the casak.

185
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:26,220
 It's pretty gruesome reading but the men, the whalers, they cut off a whale's penis, they

186
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:31,180
 skin it and then they turn the skin into a sleeveless robe, kind of like a onesie.

187
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,180
 Oh, cool.

188
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,180
 Yeah.

189
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:39,980
 And it's specifically for a man called the mincer and his job is to chop blubber and keep

190
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,620
 cooking it in the pot.

191
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,620
 Isn't it true that someone had a yacht?

192
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,620
 I want to say Jackie Onassis.

193
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,700
 It was Onassis, the husband, yeah.

194
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,700
 Aristotle Onassis.

195
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,700
 Aristotle Onassis.

196
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,340
 And well, I think you're going to know this fact, Dan, if you say that.

197
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:58,780
 But did they have a chair, which was, had whale penis as the, yeah, it was the skin of

198
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,860
 the chair was whale penis, I believe.

199
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,180
 Who's upholsted in it, yeah.

200
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,180
 Oh.

201
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,180
 Hmm.

202
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:08,420
 Who thought, first, of pissing on a cow hide to cure it?

203
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,420
 What?

204
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,420
 Unknown genius.

205
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:13,220
 They, they used piss for a lot of things, didn't they?

206
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,220
 Yeah.

207
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,220
 They tried everything.

208
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,220
 Don't they?

209
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,220
 We on everything.

210
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,220
 See what sticks.

211
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,220
 Mostly it's not useful.

212
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:23,660
 It's always just one person in the village going, have you pissed on it?

213
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,660
 Just for everything.

214
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,020
 Every new thing being tested.

215
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:31,980
 Well, my, my iPhone stuff worked.

216
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:37,180
 I wonder though, if the penis bit in Moby Dick stayed in the British version, because the

217
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:40,260
 one that was printed in Britain was massively changed, wasn't it?

218
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,740
 Which caused serious problems.

219
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:46,460
 So when it was published, I think it was actually published in the UK, maybe just before America,

220
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:51,300
 because there were weird copyright in quirk, that, um, they wanted to avoid piracy.

221
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,300
 Yeah.

222
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,300
 Exactly.

223
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:58,500
 Um, but it was printed in the UK first, but the UK publishers were kind of a combination

224
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,180
 of really careless and really prudish.

225
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:04,580
 They cut huge tracks of it out and also they cut out the epilogue.

226
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,980
 And I should say if you haven't read Moby Dick and you don't want a spoiler, then fast

227
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:13,180
 forward, like the next 15 seconds of this, but, oh, I put my hands on my ears, but I've

228
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,180
 got cancer.

229
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,180
 It's just going to make the sound more intense.

230
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,180
 Yeah.

231
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:21,780
 And also, when James says cans, he doesn't mean actual cans on his head, so I'm wearing headphones.

232
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,620
 I'm wearing the southern French city of Canada.

233
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:29,900
 Anyone who tuned out will be tuning back in right around now.

234
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,700
 Go away for five minutes and then come back.

235
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:38,620
 Disappear, go make a cup of tea. Um, basically, the epilogue is a crucial part of Moby Dick,

236
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:43,740
 because it's narrated by famously by Ishmael, hence call me Ishmael, being that famous line.

237
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:48,860
 But, uh, at the sort of apparent end of Moby Dick, then the ship goes down, everyone dies.

238
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:52,500
 It's only in the epilogue that it's explained that Ishmael has survived.

239
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,220
 So that was cut out and it got terrible reviews in Britain, because all the reviewers said,

240
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:59,380
 "Well, it doesn't make any sense how the hell is this story being narrated by someone

241
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,140
 who clearly died at the end of the book?"

242
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,820
 Yeah, the ghost of Ishmael.

243
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,820
 Yeah.

244
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:10,340
 The reviews were so bad, so I read about a few of them, um, one review in the Boston Post said,

245
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:15,300
 "We have read nearly one half of this book and are satisfied that the London Athenaeum

246
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:19,060
 is right in calling it an ill-compounded mixture of romance and matter effect."

247
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:23,180
 And the spectator said, "Nothing should be introduced into a novel which it is physically

248
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:26,660
 impossible for the writer to have known, thus he must not describe the conversation of

249
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,940
 miners in a pit if they all perish."

250
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,620
 So that was exactly that problem that you mentioned about it, yeah.

251
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,780
 And it killed his career.

252
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:37,540
 Yeah, he had a terrible career as an author for someone who's a household name.

253
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:41,380
 It's all 315 copies, and he then just gave up.

254
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:45,380
 But actually it didn't become popular, I think, until relatively recently, is that right?

255
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:50,820
 I think it was the 1950s, because the British flawed edition remained the most commonly

256
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,900
 read one for so long, and it was only when, like, the seminal text was published, and

257
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,140
 I think the 50s that people suddenly went, "Ah, this is quite good now that it makes sense."

258
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,140
 Yeah.

259
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,540
 And his other stuff sounds really interesting.

260
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:05,700
 He wrote a book called The Confidence Man, and it's a book which is all about a con man

261
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,020
 who fools people.

262
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:11,760
 It's set on one single day, and I think it's known to be the first book ever to just be

263
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,180
 set in a single day.

264
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:17,980
 And that day happens to be April Fool's Day, because he's conning someone, and the book

265
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:22,140
 itself was released on April Fool's Day to tie in with that.

266
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:26,100
 Just one other thing as well, that Herman Melville, in what he's written, is he wrote what

267
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:30,020
 is said to be the longest poem in American literature.

268
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,700
 It's almost 18,000 lines.

269
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,700
 Are you going to read it for us now?

270
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:38,500
 If you want to fast forward it, hold it for a little bit, three hours.

271
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,500
 What's it about?

272
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,940
 It's a poem and pilgrimage in the Holy Land.

273
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,940
 Oh, okay.

274
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:44,940
 Yeah.

275
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:45,940
 Yeah.

276
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:46,940
 Sounds great.

277
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:47,940
 On very old things.

278
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:48,940
 Oh, yeah.

279
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:49,940
 This was in the news this year.

280
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:55,020
 I'm not sure if it's true, but it has been claimed that some Russian scientists have

281
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:59,580
 found an extinct lion cub underneath the snow in Siberia.

282
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:05,100
 And inside that lion cub, they found two nematode worms, which must be at least 40,000 years

283
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,140
 old, and they brought them back to life.

284
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:13,380
 So there are two 40,000 year old worms currently living in Russia.

285
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,380
 They came over to Salisbury for two days.

286
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,380
 Not for that.

287
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,340
 I mean, isn't that amazing?

288
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,340
 That is amazing.

289
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,340
 Wait, so they were...

290
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,340
 Sorry.

291
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,340
 What?

292
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,340
 So how did they bring them back to life?

293
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,340
 40,000 years ago.

294
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,340
 Yeah.

295
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,580
 These worms were just happily living inside a rectum of a lion.

296
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,580
 Yeah.

297
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,580
 And then the lion died.

298
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,380
 And then it got frozen.

299
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,620
 And then they just kind of went into almost like a hibernation kind of thing.

300
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:42,020
 And when they defrosted them 40,000 years later, they just kind of, you on and off.

301
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,020
 And they're alive again.

302
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,140
 The Austin Powers of the world.

303
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,540
 They've been against none of the cultural references.

304
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:50,780
 It's going to be so difficult bringing them up to speed.

305
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,780
 It would be interesting.

306
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:56,820
 We'll never know, but to put a modern day of a species worm next to it and just...

307
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,300
 See if they chat.

308
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,300
 Just to know if that...

309
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,300
 See if they get up.

310
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,580
 Like, I would love to know how much has happened in the worm world.

311
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:06,100
 There would be enough of a difference in their conversation.

312
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,860
 I'd love to know what you think you would see.

313
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,860
 Yeah.

314
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:10,860
 Exactly.

315
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,860
 Because I'm telling you, it would be nothing.

316
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:16,060
 They're just going to sit next to each other for a bit.

317
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,860
 I wonder if they'd have sex with each other.

318
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,860
 Oh, yeah.

319
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:24,420
 Because there's an age difference, isn't there, and then there's like 40,000 year-age difference.

320
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:28,140
 Well, do you know that a very big age difference I found in nature, actually,

321
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,660
 is that between the world's oldest tortoise.

322
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,300
 So tortoises and other animals that lives a long time.

323
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,420
 And the oldest living one is Jonathan.

324
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,660
 He's 186 years old.

325
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:41,700
 And the girl that he's been trying to get off with is only 26.

326
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,820
 He's been trying to get off with her since 1991.

327
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:48,100
 The problem he might have been having is that they discovered last year.

328
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,700
 Frederica is actually most probably a male.

329
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,700
 Oh.

330
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,700
 Oh, sorry.

331
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:57,900
 You said, girl, I think you made a human woman that he was sort of infatuated with as a tortoise.

332
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,900
 No, sorry.

333
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,900
 No, sorry.

334
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,900
 You were a female tortoise.

335
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,900
 A girl tortoise, yes.

336
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:02,900
 Yeah.

337
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,620
 Turns out he's just been trying to mount another man, make babies.

338
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,620
 Which is fine.

339
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,620
 Of course.

340
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,620
 It's totally fine.

341
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,620
 It just won't make babies.

342
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,620
 No.

343
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,700
 And also, if you're a hundred and seventy odd years old, you're probably quite right-wing

344
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,700
 in your opinions.

345
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:18,780
 Do you think he's most certainly homophobic?

346
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:23,300
 I just say, at that age, I think people do get a bit like that, but they...

347
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,300
 I don't know.

348
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,300
 I think tortoises are more open-minded.

349
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,500
 I can't believe I was getting shit for talking about what worms would say to each other.

350
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:36,100
 You would just say tortoises are more open-minded.

351
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:44,340
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

352
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:49,540
 My fact this week is that the European Space Agency has a sound system so loud that if you

353
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:52,620
 heard it, it would kill you.

354
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:58,700
 Your head would explode is probably not what would happen.

355
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,260
 This is claimed by the ESA.

356
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:04,740
 They've said that they have this big sound system.

357
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,820
 Well, they definitely do have the sound system.

358
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,820
 Definitely.

359
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:08,820
 Yes, they have the sound system.

360
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,820
 It's in the Netherlands.

361
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:14,460
 And it's the ESA's large European acoustic facility, otherwise known as LEAF.

362
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,580
 It's 16.4 meters tall.

363
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:22,660
 It's 11 meters wide, 9 meters deep, and it uses nitrogen gas in order to make the sounds.

364
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:25,180
 And what they use it for is to test rockets.

365
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:29,880
 They smash sound into rockets to simulate what it might be like for when a rocket is

366
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,260
 exiting or re-entering Earth.

367
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:36,060
 So what they've said is that if you were in this room and they closed their door and this

368
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:43,660
 was put on, that it could kill you, that's a bit disputed by I think every site I've read

369
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,660
 that talks about it.

370
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,260
 We're not sure that it could do that.

371
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:49,580
 It only gets up to, I believe, 154 decibels.

372
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:54,060
 Most scientists believe that 154 decibels probably will boast your ear drums, it will cause

373
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:58,380
 pain, but it won't explode your head in the way that perhaps they're suggesting.

374
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,380
 But it won't be pleasant.

375
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,380
 It won't be pleasant.

376
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:03,820
 Especially depends what kind of music it is as well, don't forget.

377
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,820
 Yeah, do we know what kind of music they play to the rockets?

378
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,820
 Well, I read it.

379
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,820
 I read it.

380
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,660
 No, it's just sound, unfortunately, as in...

381
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,660
 Well, sorry, grab that.

382
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:14,940
 The music they say, "No, it's just sound."

383
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,620
 You and Jonathan, the talk just ain't funny.

384
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:23,060
 Well, one guy who was interviewed about it who works there says that they do, you know,

385
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,820
 you plug an iPod in and he would love to play rock music, whatever, but actually it's

386
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,900
 just a bunch of noise.

387
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:34,780
 And so basically with what sound waves are, it's molecules in the air and they're kind

388
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,900
 of getting closer together and further apart, closer together and further apart, so it's

389
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,260
 a change in pressure.

390
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:42,860
 So if you make a sound loud enough, there'll be a big enough change in pressure that it

391
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,460
 would definitely kill you, in my opinion.

392
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,460
 Wow.

393
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,460
 I'm pretty sure it would.

394
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,900
 It would probably explode your lungs, but I don't see any reason why it couldn't explode

395
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,900
 your head as well.

396
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,900
 Wow.

397
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:55,980
 I think sound waves become a shock wave, basically, at a certain point, effectively,

398
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:01,980
 and they're about 190, where it's then like the, you know, the shock wave that makes a big

399
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,140
 sonic boom.

400
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:08,140
 But yeah, they apparently also, it doesn't have to be sounds that you can hear.

401
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:14,660
 So there's infrasound, which is sounds that are out of the range of human hearing frequencies.

402
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:19,340
 And people have found that if you expose humans to infrasounds that are over 100 decibels,

403
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:22,860
 they have blood pressure and respiratory rate changes that they can't control.

404
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,020
 They just feel their breathing changing.

405
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:29,340
 And if you take the decibel level high enough, even though they can't even hear the sound,

406
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,580
 their lungs will deflate and inflate.

407
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:36,580
 So it can be used as a means of like artificial respiration if you play this inaudible sound.

408
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,580
 It's amazing.

409
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,580
 That's so weird.

410
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:43,820
 So any of these things, loudness is basically how big the amplitude and whatever it is.

411
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:47,340
 So it could be really, really, really, really loud, but you still can't hear it because

412
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,820
 it's below, say, 60 Hz.

413
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,820
 Yeah, right.

414
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:53,900
 And that, to me, that just blows my mind a little bit because how something can be really

415
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,180
 loud, but you can't hear it.

416
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,180
 That just doesn't make any sense.

417
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,180
 It's astonishing.

418
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,220
 Well, I don't like it because it can affect you.

419
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,420
 Who knows what sounds are being played right now that are screwing with our brains?

420
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,420
 No.

421
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,420
 Well, that's what they thought, didn't they?

422
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,900
 In the American Embassy in Cuba or something?

423
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,900
 Yeah.

424
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,220
 So everyone's feeling sick.

425
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:12,260
 And they thought maybe there's some infrasound kind of weapon they were using.

426
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,380
 I think probably we think that isn't true, right?

427
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,340
 I don't think they could work in fear it.

428
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,580
 They've not decided one way or the other.

429
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,780
 Or they certainly haven't said if they have.

430
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,740
 So loud noise also causes heart disease.

431
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,740
 Really?

432
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,740
 Yeah.

433
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,220
 So it's really strange.

434
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,220
 It induces a stress response.

435
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:33,420
 It disrupts your body at a cellular level and it induces a kind of fight or flight response.

436
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:37,980
 So when the stress hormones increase, that can lead to vascular damage.

437
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:42,780
 And this happens even if you're asleep, a loud noise will increase your blood pressure.

438
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,780
 Wow.

439
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,780
 So it's kind of the same.

440
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:48,660
 Even if you're not hearing it consciously, it just affects the body.

441
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,660
 Yeah.

442
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:55,220
 And every time I've ever walked into a club, I immediately want to run away as fast.

443
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,220
 That will be it.

444
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,220
 That will be possible.

445
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:01,100
 Did you know the scientists have only just discovered why cocks don't deffin themselves?

446
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,100
 Cockrels.

447
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,100
 Roles.

448
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,100
 Cockrels?

449
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,100
 Let's call them roosters.

450
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,780
 So roosters crow at over 100 decibels, which is extremely loud.

451
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,940
 It's the same as running a chainsaw right next to your ear.

452
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:11,940
 Wow.

453
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,220
 And we didn't know why they don't just go deaf, why the eardrums don't explode.

454
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,220
 And they've looked into them and there are a couple of reasons.

455
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:19,460
 So they've got an eardrum that's surrounded by a nice soft squishy tissue.

456
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:24,020
 But also, when they tilt their head back to start crowing, then they've got this little

457
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:28,300
 flap of material which drops down and covers their ear canal completely.

458
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,100
 So they've got their own built-in ear plug.

459
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,100
 Oh my god.

460
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:35,540
 Do you remember those dolls that you would get as a kid and as you sat it up, the eyes open

461
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,700
 and then the way you lay them, the same fingers.

462
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,940
 Yeah, it's exactly the same thing.

463
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,940
 The same technology.

464
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:40,940
 Yeah.

465
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:41,940
 Wow.

466
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:42,940
 That is amazing.

467
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:43,940
 It's cool.

468
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,700
 It's like being able to stick your fingers in your ears if you don't have fingers.

469
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:52,940
 It's like having a finger inside your ear that you could just kind of maneuver it inside

470
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,780
 the ear and stick it in the little canal.

471
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,780
 It's exactly like that.

472
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:59,940
 Hey, you know that song "Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution" by AC/DC?

473
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,940
 No.

474
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:01,940
 It's track 10 on Back and Black.

475
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:04,100
 It's one of the more famous songs.

476
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,100
 It's a very good one.

477
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,100
 Sing it for us.

478
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,100
 No, no, no, no, no, no.

479
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,100
 We're not allowed.

480
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,100
 For legal reasons.

481
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,100
 For legal reasons.

482
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,100
 For legal reasons.

483
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,100
 For legal reasons.

484
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,100
 For legal reasons.

485
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,100
 For legal reasons.

486
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,100
 The lyrics are "Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution".

487
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,100
 Okay.

488
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:20,700
 The Mississippi State University, who recently tested whether or not "Rock and Roll" is

489
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,700
 or "Ain't Noise Pollution" to aphids.

490
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,700
 Piss!

491
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,700
 No, sorry.

492
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,700
 To beetles.

493
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,700
 To beetles.

494
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,540
 They played rock two beetles.

495
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,380
 There's a beetle called Lady Beetles.

496
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,300
 They're living fields and they play on aphids.

497
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:40,020
 And the scientists played AC/DC at them quite loud, along with some other music.

498
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:44,180
 And they found that when it was country and folk music, the beetles didn't mind.

499
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:49,540
 But when it was AC/DC, specifically back in black, the number of aphids they caught was

500
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,540
 cut in half.

501
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:56,020
 And the aphid population rocketed and then the plants in the field were 25% smaller.

502
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,980
 So it has a big impact on farming, basically.

503
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:03,780
 So they have concluded, they said, as fans of AC/DC, we sadly must disagree with the band

504
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:07,780
 and conclude that "Rock and Roll" is "Noise Pollution" for beetles.

505
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,780
 That's so weird.

506
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,780
 I find that so weird.

507
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,780
 Do you?

508
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:17,860
 Because I think AC/DC is melodic, as much as we're about to get into the argument about

509
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,620
 whether it's metal or rock.

510
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,860
 No, I just find that a bit odd.

511
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:26,300
 Yeah, but we don't know what's making them stop eating the aphids.

512
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,820
 It might be that they're enjoying the music so much.

513
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,820
 They're just kind of bopping around and they don't have time to do that.

514
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,220
 Yeah, or they've gone off to buy the CD or something.

515
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,540
 That's possible.

516
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:43,580
 Just speaking of music, metal, Metallica this year has released a whiskey.

517
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:47,900
 So they're like growing a number of bands that are releasing their own alcohols.

518
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:52,020
 They've gone for whiskey, but the way that they are distilling the whiskey, the distilling

519
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:55,020
 process, is they are playing heavy metal to the whiskey.

520
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,020
 Right.

521
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,020
 It's very cool.

522
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:02,140
 So it's a process that then they're calling black noise and the idea is it's shaping

523
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,460
 the whiskey's flavor.

524
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:10,020
 So they play Metallica's music through a subwoofer and they disrupt the whiskey inside the barrel.

525
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:14,540
 So it's sort of just getting mixed up and mixed up and it's a molecular level of infusion

526
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,540
 going on.

527
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,180
 Yeah, what is absolute bullshit.

528
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,180
 No, no, no, no.

529
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:21,500
 I think they do this all the time to whiskey, don't they?

530
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,500
 There's always they are.

531
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,820
 This one's been at the bottom of the sea.

532
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,820
 Yeah.

533
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,820
 This one's been in space.

534
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:29,380
 This one's like, can they not just make nice whiskey that people want to buy?

535
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,380
 It's good.

536
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,980
 Listen, I'm getting this from a very, very good source.

537
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:36,900
 This is the press release released by the band.

538
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:42,180
 And yeah, it it's increased wood interaction that kicks up the wood flavor characteristics

539
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,180
 in the whiskey.

540
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,180
 I don't know what that means.

541
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,180
 I don't know where the wood bit came in.

542
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,180
 The wood comes from the barrel.

543
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,180
 For the barrels.

544
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,180
 For the barrels.

545
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:52,220
 The whole point is that the wood you use in the barrels sort of reacts with the spirit.

546
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:55,420
 That's where the taste comes from whiskey, the barrels.

547
00:24:55,420 --> 00:25:00,260
 As in they put tasteless alcohol in there and then it's in the barrels for 25 years and

548
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:03,980
 it seeps in all the flavor from the wood and that's where the whiskey plays the sweet.

549
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,980
 Is it 25 years for you?

550
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:06,980
 It's over.

551
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,980
 That's just a six week whiskey.

552
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,460
 And it just gives it a quick dip.

553
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,460

00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,460

 Is that right?

659
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,460
 That is...

660
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,460
 I mean, it's not a million miles from what I get.

661
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,460
 Well, there you go.

662
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,460
 You're the healthiest.

663
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:07,460
 It followed 500,000 people over a 10-year period and then looked at who had died at the end of it.

664
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:12,460
 And it found that you reduced your chance of death by 14% of your drinking eight plus cups

665
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:16,460
 of coffee and by 16% if you drink seven cups of coffee a day.

666
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:20,460
 Is it the caffeine that's the good ingredient or is it coffee in general?

667
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:20,460
 Is it the good ingredient or is it coffee in general?

668
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,460
 Is it the good ingredient or is it coffee in general?

669
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,460

670
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,460
 Is it the good ingredient or is it coffee in general?

671
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,460
 Is it the good ingredient or is it coffee in general?

672
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,460
 Is it the good ingredient or is it coffee in general?

673
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,460
 Is it the normal coffee?

674
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,460
 Would they still be healthy?

675
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,460
 And there's no hope here.

676
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,460
 Sorry.

677
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:33,460
 No, they don't know because it's just a statistical study.

678
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,460
 It's not a biological study as it was.

679
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,460
 They've just looked at who's dead.

680
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,460
 Right.

681
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:40,460
 But they've adjusted for other factors as in it could be...

682
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,460
 Yes.

683
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:45,460
 I'm sure they've done all the stuff that scientists are meant to do, like a chance for other mitigating

684
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,460
 factors.

685
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,460
 One would hope.

686
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,460
 South Korean schools aren't the only place to abandon coffee.

687
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,460
 Go on.

688
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,460
 Bit of a history.

689
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,460
 All of Sweden did in 1746.

690
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,460
 Wow.

691
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,460
 Yeah.

692
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,460
 This was very interesting.

693
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:01,300
 They banned coffee and it was banned by King Gustav III.

694
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:04,820
 And it was banned because they just thought that it was very bad for your health.

695
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:09,360
 So what he wanted to do was ban it and then experiment on it to see whether or not he was

696
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,060
 right in his belief or whether or not his advisors who told him that were right in their

697
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,060
 belief.

698
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:18,340
 So what they did was they started giving it to convicted criminals to test to see whether

699
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:22,820
 if they drunk coffee all day, every day or at least, you know, they all ended up being

700
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:23,820
 beheaded.

701
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,820
 So it was included.

702
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,820
 Very bad for you.

703
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:28,380
 Well, here's the thing.

704
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:31,480
 The King ordered an experiment to be done on two identical twins.

705
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:36,060
 They were both on death row, but they were both put just for life imprisonment if they

706
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:39,020
 went and did this because they wanted to see how long it could last.

707
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:42,460
 So one was given coffee every day and the other one was given tea.

708
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:46,260
 And unfortunately, Gustav III died before the experiment finished.

709
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,980
 He was having energy drinks every day, wasn't he?

710
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:49,980
 Yes.

711
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:50,980
 Exactly.

712
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,980
 Yeah.

713
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,740
 No, he was assassinated in 1792.

714
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,740
 Sorry.

715
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,740
 Sorry, guys.

716
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,740
 Too soon.

717
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,740
 Too soon.

718
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:01,460
 But yeah, we don't fully know what happened.

719
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:07,540
 Well, no, the really great thing was that so the two doctors were assigned to study the patients,

720
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:12,820
 one doctor each, but both the doctors and King Gustav all died before either the tea drinker

721
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:13,820
 or the coffee drinker.

722
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:14,820
 Yeah.

723
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,820
 Great.

724
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:19,220
 I've read an account saying that the tea drinker died first and that the solitary coffee

725
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:23,820
 drinker, who was meant to be living this unhealthy, life-start drinking coffee, lived longest

726
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,820
 of all of them.

727
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:27,340
 I think there is a question that it's a pocketful tale though.

728
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,860
 I mean, it sounds so neat.

729
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:29,860
 Yeah.

730
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:30,860
 Yeah.

731
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,860
 I found somewhere else where it was banned.

732
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:32,860
 Gone.

733
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,020
 This is in the Ottoman Empire.

734
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:40,060
 So there were lots, so it's basically originated for the first time in Yemen in the 15th century,

735
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,500
 as in grinding the beans, mixing with liquid.

736
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:46,460
 There have been various other attempts to use caffeine beans before that.

737
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:50,020
 Yemen is, or modern day Yemen, I guess, is where it first appeared.

738
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,300
 Same as India's ad.

739
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,300
 Really?

740
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,300
 Is he from Yemen?

741
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,300
 Yeah, he is.

742
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,300
 He was born there, wasn't he?

743
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,300
 Yeah.

744
00:29:56,300 --> 00:30:01,380
 Well, I thought that might go somewhere different, so.

745
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:06,100
 He then moved to Bexhillon Sea, which is where comedians like Milligan and those stations

746
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:09,900
 are ensuring the early bit of the Second World War.

747
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,900
 Where is that, Bexhillon Sea?

748
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,620
 Bexhillon Sea is just near.

749
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,620
 It's on the coast.

750
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,140
 It's sort of, you can see France in the distance.

751
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,140
 Oh, on the South Coast.

752
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,820
 Wow, there's some really nice towns here.

753
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:18,820
 Unbelievable.

754
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,180
 I've got some stuff here.

755
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:26,060
 Thank you about Yemen, where he is, I'm trying to say.

756
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:32,540
 So basically, it became really popular because it was very delicious, but also it was seen

757
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:36,580
 as quite dangerous, quite political, because you'd have a coffee house, which is where people

758
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:39,620
 meet and they can discuss, and they can discuss politics.

759
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:43,620
 So it's not like meeting at a mosque where things are a bit more police than you're only

760
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,140
 there for religious purposes.

761
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:50,100
 So it's a secular space, and also the coffee was brewed for 20 minutes and it was served

762
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:54,740
 very, very hot, so you could only drink it in tiny sips, so you kind of have to chat.

763
00:30:54,740 --> 00:31:00,540
 So the Ottoman Sultan in 1633 cracked down on it, and this is supposedly true, that he

764
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:05,340
 walked around Istanbul in disguise with a big sword ready to behead anybody he found drinking

765
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,340
 coffee.

766
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,340
 Is that right?

767
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:09,820
 Well, this is the story, and again, it may well be apocryphal.

768
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,660
 I love the detail of a big sword.

769
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:17,540
 He wasn't turning no fruit knife around.

770
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:24,860
 It was banned by Frederick the Great, 1781, because he thought that people should be taking

771
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:27,740
 beer instead of beer gruel instead of coffee.

772
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:30,060
 He thought it was a bit of a luxury.

773
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,060
 Beer gruel.

774
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:34,820
 Beer gruel would be like the porridgey stuff that you get at the bottom when you've been

775
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,500
 brewing beer.

776
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,220
 And he was brought up on that and he thought other people should be having that.

777
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:42,860
 They shouldn't be having this luxurious stuff from Yemen.

778
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:47,740
 But he actually did himself have coffee, although the difference was he bowled his with instead

779
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,740
 of water champagne.

780
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,740
 Yeah.

781
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,740
 Wow.

782
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,740
 Oh.

783
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,740
 That's way to have it.

784
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,740
 Would that be nice?

785
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,740
 Would it?

786
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,740
 Yeah.

787
00:31:55,740 --> 00:32:00,740
 I think after the fourth or fifth cup, you start to enjoy it a bit more.

788
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:09,020
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show.

789
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,300
 And that is Chazinski.

790
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:16,940
 My fact this week is that facial recognition technology for chickens allows you to pre-order

791
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:22,580
 a specific chicken and watch it grow on the farm before it ends up on your plate.

792
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,780
 It's actually quite nice.

793
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:28,220
 This is a technology that's just being patented and developed in China.

794
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:31,180
 And it's to make sure that your chicken is totally free range.

795
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:34,460
 And they've developed really advanced facial recognition technology for chickens, which

796
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:38,420
 is about, you know, late '90s percent accuracy.

797
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,220
 And so you pre-order your chicken.

798
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:44,580
 And then I guess four to six months later, once it's waddled about on its nice free range

799
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:48,740
 farm for a while, and you've been able to check it every once in a while, then you get

800
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,740
 to eat it.

801
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,740
 You check in on it.

802
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,740
 Check, check.

803
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,740
 You check.

804
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:53,740
 You check in on it.

805
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:57,420
 Well, yeah, facial recognition is going to be everywhere, isn't it?

806
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:01,220
 Well, the technology seems, yeah, really advanced in some areas and really crap in others.

807
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:06,860
 For instance, there was the trial at the 2017 Champions League final in Cardiff, where

808
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:10,500
 it was revealed that it'd wrongly identified more than 2,000 people.

809
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:16,700
 So the technology flagged up 2,470 people as potential criminals by comparing them to a

810
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,420
 database of potential criminals.

811
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:22,700
 It turned out 2,297 of those flags were false positives.

812
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,740
 Well, it's still sub-positive, though.

813
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,740
 Some positives.

814
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:30,940
 I think the police at the moment have a 98% false positive rate for their facial recognition

815
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:31,940
 technology.

816
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:35,940
 No, but those, the South Wales police, they've been improving that technology since the

817
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:36,940
 Champions League final.

818
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:42,020
 I think they switched to a new algorithm and at a recent event, they only got 10 false

819
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:46,420
 positives, which was 0.02% of the total number of matches.

820
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,420
 I'm skeptical.

821
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:50,220
 So I went to an exhibition last night at Somerset House.

822
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,500
 It's really good.

823
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:55,300
 It's basically a massive design exhibition that's taken over the whole thing.

824
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,660
 It's on for a few weeks.

825
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,940
 Each country has its own room and design piece.

826
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:03,180
 And the American one was testing facial recognition.

827
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:08,780
 So I had a go and it asks you to sit in a chair and it scans your face and it does lots of,

828
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:12,100
 you know, investigating your face, everything about it, and then tells you how old it thinks

829
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,900
 you are, whether you're male or female, all that kind of thing.

830
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:18,420
 And you're skeptical about this because I think you're a hundred and seventy-five-year-old

831
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,420
 tartarist.

832
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,420
 Oh, yeah.

833
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:26,460
 It wasn't quite that wrong, but it asked me to try and look really angry.

834
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,460
 And so I did.

835
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,460
 I tried really hard.

836
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,460
 You know, I put loads of angry faces.

837
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,460
 I see those faces.

838
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:31,460
 I see those faces.

839
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,460
 You've all seen those faces a lot.

840
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:35,300
 Give us a fake, angry face that you were giving it.

841
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,300
 Oh, that.

842
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:43,180
 To me, it's screaming constipation.

843
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:52,300
 But basically, then, I guess what expression I was trying to do, and it said calm, and then

844
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,300
 it gets my age.

845
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,620
 And I was there with my friend.

846
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,620
 She did it and I did it.

847
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,620
 It said it.

848
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:02,060
 It thought I was a female age 15 to 20, which is extremely flashing, but I'm not the kind

849
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,060
 of person.

850
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,980
 I mean, no one has wrinkles between 15 and 20.

851
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,300
 Why can't it spot that?

852
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:11,220
 And it said my poor friend was a female age 55 to 65.

853
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,900
 Who's my age?

854
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:16,380
 So I think the average they got it right.

855
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,380
 Pretty much.

856
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,380
 Right.

857
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,380
 Is that what they're going for?

858
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:23,500
 In Finland, they're testing a new technology.

859
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:27,860
 So the idea is that when you walk into a shop, they're developing scanners that when you

860
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:33,020
 walk in up to the till, you give a meaningful nod, as it says in the quotes, that's how they've

861
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:37,060
 said in this video, you give a meaningful nod to the scanner, and that's how you pay.

862
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:41,300
 And it's memorized through, in the same way, with your bank card details, your face is

863
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,300
 going on.

864
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,300
 Creepy, creepy, creepy, creepy.

865
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,300
 Yeah.

866
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:47,100
 I am going to trick all this facial recognition stuff, and I found out a method I can do.

867
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,500
 I deliberately disfiguring your own face.

868
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,500
 That's right.

869
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:55,900
 So it turns out that you can't trick good facial recognition systems by wearing makeup.

870
00:35:55,900 --> 00:36:00,020
 Even if you're wearing weird goth style makeup, it doesn't work.

871
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:04,180
 But there is a guy online, and his name is Taki on, that's his Twitter account, he has

872
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:12,500
 found that the kind of makeup worn by fans of the insane clown posse, aka Juggalos, right?

873
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:18,020
 They wear very heavy clown makeup, and it completely redefines what the computer sees

874
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,540
 as your jawline.

875
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:24,460
 So we may still see people wearing clown masks for bank robberies, but they'll just be

876
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,780
 wearing clown makeup instead.

877
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,820
 That's very clever.

878
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:28,820
 Oh.

879
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,820
 But they tried to train them up, didn't they?

880
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:35,340
 Recently, I think you mentioned fleetingly in a podcast a few months ago, Andy, that the

881
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:42,460
 South Wales Police sent facial recognition AI to a massive Elvis impersonator festival,

882
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:46,500
 the biggest one in the world, in order to hone its techniques to see if it could distinguish

883
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,980
 between different Elvis impersonators.

884
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:52,780
 Oh, speaking of Elvis, I've been reading up on him recently.

885
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:57,900
 I was reading this one article that was published on the enemy, and it's one of those things

886
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,580
 that we don't usually naturally go to when we're doing our research, you know, something

887
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:07,260
 that's like 101 amazing things that you'll, but this article called 75 geeky facts you

888
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,020
 might not know about Elvis Presley.

889
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:12,220
 And it was genuinely incredible every time I give this one.

890
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,820
 Okay, here's one.

891
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:18,660
 The inspiration for Elvis Presley's trademark jumpsuit and quiff look was a comic book hero

892
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:23,300
 Captain Marvel Jr. is what inspired Elvis Presley's look.

893
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:28,700
 This is the geekiest foundations for what it seemed to be the coolest singer of the 1950s

894
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,460
 and so did he say that was, did he used to read them?

895
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:35,460
 He must have, as a kid, yeah, he was obsessed with them, I believe, when he was younger.

896
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:38,060
 And so that's what he based his look on.

897
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:42,620
 Here's another one just before he died, Elvis commissioned his stage electrician to design

898
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:46,700
 a version of his big white jumpsuit that he wore, which would fire laser beams into

899
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,120
 the audience from the suit.

900
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,120
 I mean, that's incredible.

901
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,120
 I've not heard that before.

902
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,820
 Do you know Elvis?

903
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,900
 He, Elvis impersonators.

904
00:37:54,900 --> 00:38:00,740
 Do you know the first Elvis impersonator was in 1954, which is two years before Elvis's

905
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,740
 first hit single?

906
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,740
 What?

907
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:06,300
 This guy was called Carl Cheesy Nelson.

908
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,300
 That is.

909
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,300
 Cheesy.

910
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,300
 Cheesy.

911
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,300
 It was his nickname.

912
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,300
 That was his middle name.

913
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,300
 Okay.

914
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:17,580
 And basically, what had happened was Elvis had been delayed for a show and this guy was

915
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:18,940
 a really good friend of Elvis.

916
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:22,540
 And so he did the whole show just copying his entire style.

917
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,540
 That's so cool.

918
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,540
 So, yeah, that's amazing.

919
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,540
 That's amazing.

920
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,540
 That's so funny.

921
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:31,260
 Just while we're on impersonators, and again, from this NME article, really fascinating.

922
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:36,060
 In Somalia, going to strict Islamic law, Elvis impersonators are required to have beards.

923
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,060
 Right.

924
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,060
 So you can do everything.

925
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:40,340
 And I'm reading these facts word for word, I should say.

926
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:42,460
 It's such a brilliant article.

927
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:45,340
 Just one more thing I found really interesting about facial recognition.

928
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,340
 Oh, yeah.

929
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:50,740
 Do you know that shops in London have it specifically for celebrities?

930
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:55,980
 So a bunch of stores in London, more than a dozen stores in 2013, installed this technology,

931
00:38:55,980 --> 00:39:01,140
 which is VIP facial recognition technology, to stop that moment when someone super famous

932
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,140
 walks in.

933
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:06,180
 And as a shop assistant, you're supposed to be really kind of nice and sequest to them,

934
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,620
 but you don't know who they are.

935
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:12,340
 So it has a database of all celebrities' faces, and as soon as a celebrity walks in, then

936
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:16,380
 a thing pops up on these guys' tills that says, "Oh, Julia Roberts has just entered the

937
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,380
 building."

938
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:21,340
 And also with a bit of info about her, like, she is this size, and she likes this style of

939
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:24,420
 thing, and go and force her to buy some shit.

940
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:29,700
 If only Hugh Grant had had that in Notting Hill when Julia Roberts walked into his bookshop.

941
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,700
 Oh, if only.

942
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,500
 They could have done the whole film in half an hour.

943
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,500
 You're so right.

944
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:38,340
 And he would have sold her a book she actually wanted to buy, because it would have had a preferences.

945
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,620
 I have a thing about facial recognition and celebrities.

946
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,340
 This is weirdly similar to that.

947
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:50,260
 So still on the tricking facial recognition thing, there are specially designed glasses

948
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:55,340
 which can make facial recognition computers think that you are Miller Yovervitch.

949
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,340
 Who?

950
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,340
 Miller Yovervitch?

951
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,340
 Yeah, Miller Yovervitch.

952
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,340
 She's in the fifth element.

953
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:04,460
 She's a model slash actor, resident, she's in all six of the resident evil movies, and

954
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,540
 she does a brilliant job at them.

955
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,540
 So they only tell you when it's her?

956
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,540
 No, no, no.

957
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:13,020
 They make the computer think that you are Miller Yovervitch.

958
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,020
 Got it.

959
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,020
 So it's really bizarre.

960
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:18,980
 They've got, they can be made up to look like normal tortoise glasses, but on the front

961
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:23,020
 of the rims, they've got these specially printed images, okay?

962
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:27,700
 And the frames kind of overlay the face with pixels.

963
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:31,580
 And when the computer looks at you, it's calculations are disturbed and it thinks that you are

964
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:34,060
 someone else in its database.

965
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,380
 And I think there are limits.

966
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:39,740
 As in I think you, you might have to be a woman, for example, with that, with a slightly

967
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:43,540
 different bone structure, or you might need to be white as Miller Yovervitch.

968
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:50,020
 Do you think wholesale people might start robbing banks, looking like Miller Yovervitch?

969
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,020
 What an idea.

970
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,020
 Yeah.

971
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,740
 And then she's just going to get arrested, obviously.

972
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:54,740
 Yeah.

973
00:40:54,740 --> 00:41:04,660
 Just be her in the insane clown posse in prison.

974
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,660
 Okay.

975
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:06,660
 That is it.

976
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,660
 That is all of our facts.
