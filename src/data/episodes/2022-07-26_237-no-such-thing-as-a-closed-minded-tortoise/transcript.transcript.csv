00:00:00,00:00:24,No one is coming to you from 2020 Audio.
00:00:24,00:00:28,"My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin"
00:00:28,00:00:32,and Annotch is Innski and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our
00:00:32,00:00:37,4th favorite facts from the last 7 days and in no particular order here we go.
00:00:37,00:00:40,"Sorry Dan, can I ask you who 2020 Audio is?"
00:00:40,00:00:41,Yes.
00:00:41,00:00:42,I came out of nowhere a little bit.
00:00:42,00:00:43,Yeah sorry about that.
00:00:43,00:00:47,2020 Audio is where we are recording the audiobook for our Book of the Year which will
00:00:47,00:00:53,"be entitled ""Audio Book of the Year"" and we are in the very booth that it has been recorded."
00:00:53,00:00:54,Yes.
00:00:54,00:01:01,The honour of being in the same booth as the no such thing as a fish team when they recorded
00:01:01,00:01:05,the audio but not 1 hour ago.
00:01:05,00:01:09,"That author is, we are mere podcasters, such an honour."
00:01:09,00:01:13,"Okay, starting with fact number 1 and that is Andy."
00:01:13,00:01:19,My fact is that there are whales alive today who were alive before Moby Dick was written.
00:01:19,00:01:20,Wow.
00:01:20,00:01:24,Does that mean so that book was written about a real whale?
00:01:24,00:01:25,Yes.
00:01:25,00:01:27,So might that whale still be alive?
00:01:27,00:01:28,No.
00:01:28,00:01:35,So because there are different kinds of whales there are particular whales which do live
00:01:35,00:01:37,for at least 200 years.
00:01:37,00:01:40,We know that but they are bow head whales and I think the whale and Moby Dick was a sperm
00:01:40,00:01:41,whale.
00:01:41,00:01:42,Yeah.
00:01:42,00:01:44,So I don't know how long live sperm whales are actually.
00:01:44,00:01:45,It is possible.
00:01:45,00:01:46,Wow.
00:01:46,00:01:47,There is a bow head.
00:01:47,00:01:48,Sorry you said bow head whales.
00:01:48,00:01:54,So bow head whales are they have got a life expectancy that can actually go up to 250 years
00:01:54,00:01:56,I remember.
00:01:56,00:02:03,So that would mean that not only were they alive longer then let's say the book itself
00:02:03,00:02:07,Moby Dick was written but potentially there is one that is alive that was born the year
00:02:07,00:02:10,that Herman Melville the author of Moby Dick was born.
00:02:10,00:02:11,Oh wow.
00:02:11,00:02:12,Yeah he wrote the book at 32 years old.
00:02:12,00:02:13,Wow.
00:02:13,00:02:14,And it was in 1851.
00:02:14,00:02:15,Yes.
00:02:15,00:02:20,And here is another thing the first New England Whalers so the first people from North America
00:02:20,00:02:26,who were whaling around there they started in 1791 and that was 227 years ago.
00:02:26,00:02:31,So there might be some whales alive who remember a time before whaling in that area of the
00:02:31,00:02:32,world.
00:02:32,00:02:33,Wow.
00:02:33,00:02:36,Oh my god the time when they were free roaming the waters with no fear.
00:02:36,00:02:37,Well this is the thing.
00:02:37,00:02:42,So there was this massive bout of whaling in the Arctic especially between 1848 and 1915.
00:02:42,00:02:47,So the bowhead whales in the Arctic all but about I think 1200 of them were killed 30 years
00:02:47,00:02:49,ago they're only about 1200 left.
00:02:49,00:02:53,So it's not like we have an individual we can definitely point to that whale and say that
00:02:53,00:02:55,one was alive before Moby Dick.
00:02:55,00:03:02,But they did find one recently which had a harpoon in it and they tested the age of the
00:03:02,00:03:08,harpoon and they found it had only been manufactured between 1879 and 1885 that specific harpoon.
00:03:08,00:03:13,So the whale was probably harpooned sometime from 1885 to 95 or it could be someone who
00:03:13,00:03:19,just likes old harpoons like a modern day guy who's you know he's just using really old
00:03:19,00:03:20,material.
00:03:20,00:03:24,It could have been harpooned three years ago with an ancient harpoon supported off the day.
00:03:24,00:03:28,But they reckon that that one that they found the harpoon and was 211 years old.
00:03:28,00:03:29,So that's yeah.
00:03:29,00:03:32,So basically these bowhead whales in particular are very very old.
00:03:32,00:03:36,And it's one of the best ways to date them sometimes is when the harpoons came from because
00:03:36,00:03:41,"they're often found with harpoons in them embedded in their blubber, aren't they?"
00:03:41,00:03:44,But we should say with bowhead whales you were saying there were only about 1200 left.
00:03:44,00:03:47,"That was about 30, 30 years ago."
00:03:47,00:03:49,"And today there are 14,000 some good whale news."
00:03:49,00:03:50,"Oh, that was good."
00:03:50,00:03:53,So that actually conservation is really worth.
00:03:53,00:03:54,Wow.
00:03:54,00:03:58,But yeah people used to harpoon a lot but whales can survive a huge amount of harpooning.
00:03:58,00:04:04,So in fact the whale that Moby Dick was based on was a real life whale called Mocha Dick.
00:04:04,00:04:08,You can see how a Melville really uses imagination when he switched names there.
00:04:08,00:04:13,"And Mocha Dick was a super famous whale in the 1830s, sort of terrorised boaters."
00:04:13,00:04:16,And it was swim really calmly next to a wailing boat.
00:04:16,00:04:19,But then at the first sign of aggression from the boat it would like attack the boat and
00:04:19,00:04:20,tip people out.
00:04:20,00:04:24,And when it finally died in 1839 it had 19 harpoons lodged in its side.
00:04:24,00:04:25,Wow.
00:04:25,00:04:26,There he is bits of harpoon.
00:04:26,00:04:27,19.
00:04:27,00:04:28,Wow.
00:04:28,00:04:30,Because they get stuck in the blubber don't they?
00:04:30,00:04:31,Yeah.
00:04:31,00:04:33,And Mocha Dick was a sperm whale I think.
00:04:33,00:04:39,Of the bowhead whales they have more blubber than anyone they have up to half a meter thick
00:04:39,00:04:40,of blubber.
00:04:40,00:04:41,Wow.
00:04:41,00:04:42,That is a lot I think.
00:04:42,00:04:46,You sort of body shaming the old bowhead a little bit aren't you?
00:04:46,00:04:48,Well they're really weird animals aren't they?
00:04:48,00:04:54,Because they've got a skull which is up to 40% of their body length.
00:04:54,00:04:57,So the skull alone could be over five meters long.
00:04:57,00:05:01,And the really weird thing about them is that they have the largest mouth of any living
00:05:01,00:05:02,animal.
00:05:02,00:05:04,But they have no teeth.
00:05:04,00:05:06,Like large in terms of depth breath.
00:05:06,00:05:07,I think volume.
00:05:07,00:05:08,Volume.
00:05:08,00:05:09,Yeah.
00:05:09,00:05:12,So it's larger than a blue whale's mouth even though the bowhead is slightly smaller it's
00:05:12,00:05:17,got such a massive head that I've read this fact about blue whales which I guess must
00:05:17,00:05:21,be true about bowhead whales if it's true about blue whales which you might not be.
00:05:21,00:05:27,But it is that the amount of water that a blue whale can fit in its mouth is heavier than
00:05:27,00:05:28,a blue whale itself.
00:05:28,00:05:29,What?
00:05:29,00:05:30,Oh really?
00:05:30,00:05:31,Yeah.
00:05:31,00:05:32,That's plausible actually isn't it?
00:05:32,00:05:33,Yeah.
00:05:33,00:05:35,Are you going to say why don't they sink?
00:05:35,00:05:36,"No, I wasn't."
00:05:36,00:05:42,I was going to say do they expand to a double blue whale size like a pufferfish?
00:05:42,00:05:45,No it's about different densities so I guess water's more dense.
00:05:45,00:05:46,Yeah.
00:05:46,00:05:49,Then blubber especially because blubber's quite buoyant isn't it?
00:05:49,00:05:50,Yeah.
00:05:50,00:05:54,That's why women I think are often better at floating.
00:05:54,00:05:58,This is actually only my subjective experience but I find it quite easy to swim and I'm
00:05:58,00:06:01,often swimming with men who sink more easily and I think it's because women naturally
00:06:01,00:06:02,have a bit more water fat.
00:06:02,00:06:05,But you are going regularly harpoon to a little downside aren't you?
00:06:05,00:06:10,I've got 14 harpoons in pale in my sight at this moment.
00:06:10,00:06:14,I should just sorry just one more thing I learned about harpoons that I didn't know which
00:06:14,00:06:18,I found out from that one that was discovered that was 130 years old.
00:06:18,00:06:22,They had explosives in them which I didn't realise they did so they harpoon them and they
00:06:22,00:06:23,were timed explosive.
00:06:23,00:06:27,"This is in the mid 19th century, timed explosive so they went inside and then they were"
00:06:27,00:06:32,timed to explode once in there.
00:06:32,00:06:35,They didn't use harpoons to kill whales did they?
00:06:35,00:06:39,That's you kill a whale with a lance or with a club or something like that.
00:06:39,00:06:43,You use your harpoon to kind of catch it and then it kind of drags you along until it
00:06:43,00:06:46,gets tired and then once it's tired you can kind of kill it with something else.
00:06:46,00:06:48,I see.
00:06:48,00:06:53,"The bowhead whales, have we said before that they have giant penises in their heads?"
00:06:53,00:06:54,What?
00:06:54,00:06:58,"Well, sort of very penis equivalent thing."
00:06:58,00:07:02,They have this massive ridge of tissue and it's called the corpus cavernosum axilaris.
00:07:02,00:07:07,Now any latin or penis fans might remember that there is a thing in the human penis called
00:07:07,00:07:11,"the corpus cavernosum and that's the thing which fills with blood, those are the chambers"
00:07:11,00:07:15,which fill up and they do the same thing in the whale but they're to cool the whale down.
00:07:15,00:07:19,So when the whale is swimming around and is getting really active there's a real risk
00:07:19,00:07:23,that they'll overheat because they've got so much blood there they can get really hot
00:07:23,00:07:29,really easily so they engorge this corpus cavernosum axilaris which means in the head with blood
00:07:29,00:07:33,"and then it opens its mouth, cold sea water flows in, cools the blood flows back out."
00:07:33,00:07:36,So it's their way of cooling themselves down using this giant head penis.
00:07:36,00:07:40,That's weird that they need to cool themselves down because they are found in cool water which
00:07:40,00:07:44,"is one of the reasons for their longevity, isn't it?"
00:07:44,00:07:47,"Yeah, but they're constantly wearing a really thick coat basically and if you're trying"
00:07:47,00:07:52,"to do anything in a thick coat or warm up, it is a bit like having a big coat all"
00:07:52,00:07:58,"the time on a cold day but then whenever you want to cool down, get in an erection and pouring"
00:07:58,00:08:03,"cold water into your butts and that's effectively what we're saying, isn't it?"
00:08:03,00:08:06,"Yeah, it doesn't sound like a crazy way of cooling down."
00:08:06,00:08:07,It does.
00:08:07,00:08:09,I think people would call you crazy if you started doing that.
00:08:09,00:08:10,Not on the bus.
00:08:10,00:08:11,Not on the bus.
00:08:11,00:08:17,"Oh, I actually have a coat fact related to whales."
00:08:17,00:08:23,"Yeah, I love this. Some of the earliest waterproof jackets were made from whale intestines and"
00:08:23,00:08:26,it was the innuets who used to wear them because they are really waterproof.
00:08:26,00:08:31,"I was thinking intestines are full of water, bodily water, but very permeable because the"
00:08:31,00:08:35,"nutrients have to permeate through them and so yeah, they would turn them into waterproof"
00:08:35,00:08:36,jackets.
00:08:36,00:08:37,That is amazing.
00:08:37,00:08:40,I don't really know what an intestine looks like but I imagine it's a bit like a puffer
00:08:40,00:08:43,jacket because it's going to have lots of folds in it.
00:08:43,00:08:44,You're right.
00:08:44,00:08:45,All the folds.
00:08:45,00:08:49,"So, what would they do to preserve it so it doesn't rot?"
00:08:49,00:08:52,"Oh, I guess they're keeping it on ice most of the time anyway."
00:08:52,00:08:53,"Yeah, that's a good point."
00:08:53,00:08:54,That's a good point.
00:08:54,00:08:55,"If you dry it out, I guess."
00:08:55,00:08:56,Don't know that.
00:08:56,00:08:57,"Oh, that's true."
00:08:57,00:08:58,We wear leather clothes sometimes.
00:08:58,00:08:59,Yeah.
00:08:59,00:09:00,Just cure it.
00:09:00,00:09:06,"Yeah, cure it with urine, for instance, if you get cow hide and then you put a load of urine"
00:09:06,00:09:09,"on it for ages and ages and ages, it'll get cured and it won't go rotten."
00:09:09,00:09:10,This is very weird.
00:09:10,00:09:13,"I have another whale based clothing fact, which I didn't even realise and it's about"
00:09:13,00:09:14,Moby Dick too.
00:09:14,00:09:21,"So, there's a whole chapter in Moby Dick on the whale's penis and it's called the casak."
00:09:21,00:09:26,"It's pretty gruesome reading but the men, the whalers, they cut off a whale's penis, they"
00:09:26,00:09:31,"skin it and then they turn the skin into a sleeveless robe, kind of like a onesie."
00:09:31,00:09:32,"Oh, cool."
00:09:32,00:09:33,Yeah.
00:09:33,00:09:39,And it's specifically for a man called the mincer and his job is to chop blubber and keep
00:09:39,00:09:41,cooking it in the pot.
00:09:41,00:09:43,Isn't it true that someone had a yacht?
00:09:43,00:09:44,I want to say Jackie Onassis.
00:09:44,00:09:47,"It was Onassis, the husband, yeah."
00:09:47,00:09:48,Aristotle Onassis.
00:09:48,00:09:49,Aristotle Onassis.
00:09:49,00:09:52,"And well, I think you're going to know this fact, Dan, if you say that."
00:09:52,00:09:58,"But did they have a chair, which was, had whale penis as the, yeah, it was the skin of"
00:09:58,00:10:00,"the chair was whale penis, I believe."
00:10:00,00:10:02,"Who's upholsted in it, yeah."
00:10:02,00:10:03,Oh.
00:10:03,00:10:04,Hmm.
00:10:04,00:10:08,"Who thought, first, of pissing on a cow hide to cure it?"
00:10:08,00:10:09,What?
00:10:09,00:10:10,Unknown genius.
00:10:10,00:10:13,"They, they used piss for a lot of things, didn't they?"
00:10:13,00:10:14,Yeah.
00:10:14,00:10:15,They tried everything.
00:10:15,00:10:16,Don't they?
00:10:16,00:10:17,We on everything.
00:10:17,00:10:18,See what sticks.
00:10:18,00:10:19,Mostly it's not useful.
00:10:19,00:10:23,"It's always just one person in the village going, have you pissed on it?"
00:10:23,00:10:24,Just for everything.
00:10:24,00:10:27,Every new thing being tested.
00:10:27,00:10:31,"Well, my, my iPhone stuff worked."
00:10:31,00:10:37,"I wonder though, if the penis bit in Moby Dick stayed in the British version, because the"
00:10:37,00:10:40,"one that was printed in Britain was massively changed, wasn't it?"
00:10:40,00:10:41,Which caused serious problems.
00:10:41,00:10:46,"So when it was published, I think it was actually published in the UK, maybe just before America,"
00:10:46,00:10:51,"because there were weird copyright in quirk, that, um, they wanted to avoid piracy."
00:10:51,00:10:52,Yeah.
00:10:52,00:10:53,Exactly.
00:10:53,00:10:58,"Um, but it was printed in the UK first, but the UK publishers were kind of a combination"
00:10:58,00:11:00,of really careless and really prudish.
00:11:00,00:11:04,They cut huge tracks of it out and also they cut out the epilogue.
00:11:04,00:11:07,"And I should say if you haven't read Moby Dick and you don't want a spoiler, then fast"
00:11:07,00:11:13,"forward, like the next 15 seconds of this, but, oh, I put my hands on my ears, but I've"
00:11:13,00:11:14,got cancer.
00:11:14,00:11:16,It's just going to make the sound more intense.
00:11:16,00:11:17,Yeah.
00:11:17,00:11:21,"And also, when James says cans, he doesn't mean actual cans on his head, so I'm wearing headphones."
00:11:21,00:11:24,I'm wearing the southern French city of Canada.
00:11:24,00:11:29,Anyone who tuned out will be tuning back in right around now.
00:11:29,00:11:32,Go away for five minutes and then come back.
00:11:32,00:11:38,"Disappear, go make a cup of tea. Um, basically, the epilogue is a crucial part of Moby Dick,"
00:11:38,00:11:43,"because it's narrated by famously by Ishmael, hence call me Ishmael, being that famous line."
00:11:43,00:11:48,"But, uh, at the sort of apparent end of Moby Dick, then the ship goes down, everyone dies."
00:11:48,00:11:52,It's only in the epilogue that it's explained that Ishmael has survived.
00:11:52,00:11:56,"So that was cut out and it got terrible reviews in Britain, because all the reviewers said,"
00:11:56,00:11:59,"""Well, it doesn't make any sense how the hell is this story being narrated by someone"
00:11:59,00:12:01,"who clearly died at the end of the book?"""
00:12:01,00:12:02,"Yeah, the ghost of Ishmael."
00:12:02,00:12:03,Yeah.
00:12:03,00:12:10,"The reviews were so bad, so I read about a few of them, um, one review in the Boston Post said,"
00:12:10,00:12:15,"""We have read nearly one half of this book and are satisfied that the London Athenaeum"
00:12:15,00:12:19,"is right in calling it an ill-compounded mixture of romance and matter effect."""
00:12:19,00:12:23,"And the spectator said, ""Nothing should be introduced into a novel which it is physically"
00:12:23,00:12:26,"impossible for the writer to have known, thus he must not describe the conversation of"
00:12:26,00:12:28,"miners in a pit if they all perish."""
00:12:28,00:12:31,"So that was exactly that problem that you mentioned about it, yeah."
00:12:31,00:12:32,And it killed his career.
00:12:32,00:12:37,"Yeah, he had a terrible career as an author for someone who's a household name."
00:12:37,00:12:41,"It's all 315 copies, and he then just gave up."
00:12:41,00:12:45,"But actually it didn't become popular, I think, until relatively recently, is that right?"
00:12:45,00:12:50,"I think it was the 1950s, because the British flawed edition remained the most commonly"
00:12:50,00:12:54,"read one for so long, and it was only when, like, the seminal text was published, and"
00:12:54,00:12:58,"I think the 50s that people suddenly went, ""Ah, this is quite good now that it makes sense."""
00:12:58,00:12:59,Yeah.
00:12:59,00:13:00,And his other stuff sounds really interesting.
00:13:00,00:13:05,"He wrote a book called The Confidence Man, and it's a book which is all about a con man"
00:13:05,00:13:07,who fools people.
00:13:07,00:13:11,"It's set on one single day, and I think it's known to be the first book ever to just be"
00:13:11,00:13:14,set in a single day.
00:13:14,00:13:17,"And that day happens to be April Fool's Day, because he's conning someone, and the book"
00:13:17,00:13:22,itself was released on April Fool's Day to tie in with that.
00:13:22,00:13:26,"Just one other thing as well, that Herman Melville, in what he's written, is he wrote what"
00:13:26,00:13:30,is said to be the longest poem in American literature.
00:13:30,00:13:31,"It's almost 18,000 lines."
00:13:31,00:13:33,Are you going to read it for us now?
00:13:33,00:13:38,"If you want to fast forward it, hold it for a little bit, three hours."
00:13:38,00:13:39,What's it about?
00:13:39,00:13:42,It's a poem and pilgrimage in the Holy Land.
00:13:42,00:13:43,"Oh, okay."
00:13:43,00:13:44,Yeah.
00:13:44,00:13:45,Yeah.
00:13:45,00:13:46,Sounds great.
00:13:46,00:13:47,On very old things.
00:13:47,00:13:48,"Oh, yeah."
00:13:48,00:13:49,This was in the news this year.
00:13:49,00:13:55,"I'm not sure if it's true, but it has been claimed that some Russian scientists have"
00:13:55,00:13:59,found an extinct lion cub underneath the snow in Siberia.
00:13:59,00:14:05,"And inside that lion cub, they found two nematode worms, which must be at least 40,000 years"
00:14:05,00:14:08,"old, and they brought them back to life."
00:14:08,00:14:13,"So there are two 40,000 year old worms currently living in Russia."
00:14:13,00:14:15,They came over to Salisbury for two days.
00:14:15,00:14:16,Not for that.
00:14:16,00:14:18,"I mean, isn't that amazing?"
00:14:18,00:14:19,That is amazing.
00:14:19,00:14:20,"Wait, so they were..."
00:14:20,00:14:21,Sorry.
00:14:21,00:14:22,What?
00:14:22,00:14:23,So how did they bring them back to life?
00:14:23,00:14:24,"40,000 years ago."
00:14:24,00:14:25,Yeah.
00:14:25,00:14:28,These worms were just happily living inside a rectum of a lion.
00:14:28,00:14:29,Yeah.
00:14:29,00:14:30,And then the lion died.
00:14:30,00:14:32,And then it got frozen.
00:14:32,00:14:35,And then they just kind of went into almost like a hibernation kind of thing.
00:14:35,00:14:42,"And when they defrosted them 40,000 years later, they just kind of, you on and off."
00:14:42,00:14:43,And they're alive again.
00:14:43,00:14:45,The Austin Powers of the world.
00:14:45,00:14:47,They've been against none of the cultural references.
00:14:47,00:14:50,It's going to be so difficult bringing them up to speed.
00:14:50,00:14:51,It would be interesting.
00:14:51,00:14:56,"We'll never know, but to put a modern day of a species worm next to it and just..."
00:14:56,00:14:58,See if they chat.
00:14:58,00:14:59,Just to know if that...
00:14:59,00:15:00,See if they get up.
00:15:00,00:15:03,"Like, I would love to know how much has happened in the worm world."
00:15:03,00:15:06,There would be enough of a difference in their conversation.
00:15:06,00:15:08,I'd love to know what you think you would see.
00:15:08,00:15:09,Yeah.
00:15:09,00:15:10,Exactly.
00:15:10,00:15:12,"Because I'm telling you, it would be nothing."
00:15:12,00:15:16,They're just going to sit next to each other for a bit.
00:15:16,00:15:17,I wonder if they'd have sex with each other.
00:15:17,00:15:18,"Oh, yeah."
00:15:18,00:15:24,"Because there's an age difference, isn't there, and then there's like 40,000 year-age difference."
00:15:24,00:15:28,"Well, do you know that a very big age difference I found in nature, actually,"
00:15:28,00:15:30,is that between the world's oldest tortoise.
00:15:30,00:15:33,So tortoises and other animals that lives a long time.
00:15:33,00:15:35,And the oldest living one is Jonathan.
00:15:35,00:15:37,He's 186 years old.
00:15:37,00:15:41,And the girl that he's been trying to get off with is only 26.
00:15:41,00:15:44,He's been trying to get off with her since 1991.
00:15:44,00:15:48,The problem he might have been having is that they discovered last year.
00:15:48,00:15:50,Frederica is actually most probably a male.
00:15:50,00:15:51,Oh.
00:15:51,00:15:52,"Oh, sorry."
00:15:52,00:15:57,"You said, girl, I think you made a human woman that he was sort of infatuated with as a tortoise."
00:15:57,00:15:58,"No, sorry."
00:15:58,00:15:59,"No, sorry."
00:15:59,00:16:00,You were a female tortoise.
00:16:00,00:16:01,"A girl tortoise, yes."
00:16:01,00:16:02,Yeah.
00:16:02,00:16:05,"Turns out he's just been trying to mount another man, make babies."
00:16:05,00:16:06,Which is fine.
00:16:06,00:16:07,Of course.
00:16:07,00:16:08,It's totally fine.
00:16:08,00:16:09,It just won't make babies.
00:16:09,00:16:10,No.
00:16:10,00:16:12,"And also, if you're a hundred and seventy odd years old, you're probably quite right-wing"
00:16:12,00:16:13,in your opinions.
00:16:13,00:16:18,Do you think he's most certainly homophobic?
00:16:18,00:16:23,"I just say, at that age, I think people do get a bit like that, but they..."
00:16:23,00:16:24,I don't know.
00:16:24,00:16:26,I think tortoises are more open-minded.
00:16:26,00:16:29,I can't believe I was getting shit for talking about what worms would say to each other.
00:16:29,00:16:36,You would just say tortoises are more open-minded.
00:16:36,00:16:44,"Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact."
00:16:44,00:16:49,My fact this week is that the European Space Agency has a sound system so loud that if you
00:16:49,00:16:52,"heard it, it would kill you."
00:16:52,00:16:58,Your head would explode is probably not what would happen.
00:16:58,00:17:01,This is claimed by the ESA.
00:17:01,00:17:04,They've said that they have this big sound system.
00:17:04,00:17:06,"Well, they definitely do have the sound system."
00:17:06,00:17:07,Definitely.
00:17:07,00:17:08,"Yes, they have the sound system."
00:17:08,00:17:09,It's in the Netherlands.
00:17:09,00:17:14,"And it's the ESA's large European acoustic facility, otherwise known as LEAF."
00:17:14,00:17:16,It's 16.4 meters tall.
00:17:16,00:17:22,"It's 11 meters wide, 9 meters deep, and it uses nitrogen gas in order to make the sounds."
00:17:22,00:17:25,And what they use it for is to test rockets.
00:17:25,00:17:29,They smash sound into rockets to simulate what it might be like for when a rocket is
00:17:29,00:17:32,exiting or re-entering Earth.
00:17:32,00:17:36,So what they've said is that if you were in this room and they closed their door and this
00:17:36,00:17:43,"was put on, that it could kill you, that's a bit disputed by I think every site I've read"
00:17:43,00:17:44,that talks about it.
00:17:44,00:17:46,We're not sure that it could do that.
00:17:46,00:17:49,"It only gets up to, I believe, 154 decibels."
00:17:49,00:17:54,"Most scientists believe that 154 decibels probably will boast your ear drums, it will cause"
00:17:54,00:17:58,"pain, but it won't explode your head in the way that perhaps they're suggesting."
00:17:58,00:17:59,But it won't be pleasant.
00:17:59,00:18:00,It won't be pleasant.
00:18:00,00:18:03,"Especially depends what kind of music it is as well, don't forget."
00:18:03,00:18:05,"Yeah, do we know what kind of music they play to the rockets?"
00:18:05,00:18:06,"Well, I read it."
00:18:06,00:18:07,I read it.
00:18:07,00:18:10,"No, it's just sound, unfortunately, as in..."
00:18:10,00:18:11,"Well, sorry, grab that."
00:18:11,00:18:14,"The music they say, ""No, it's just sound."""
00:18:14,00:18:18,"You and Jonathan, the talk just ain't funny."
00:18:18,00:18:23,"Well, one guy who was interviewed about it who works there says that they do, you know,"
00:18:23,00:18:26,"you plug an iPod in and he would love to play rock music, whatever, but actually it's"
00:18:26,00:18:28,just a bunch of noise.
00:18:28,00:18:34,"And so basically with what sound waves are, it's molecules in the air and they're kind"
00:18:34,00:18:37,"of getting closer together and further apart, closer together and further apart, so it's"
00:18:37,00:18:39,a change in pressure.
00:18:39,00:18:42,"So if you make a sound loud enough, there'll be a big enough change in pressure that it"
00:18:42,00:18:44,"would definitely kill you, in my opinion."
00:18:44,00:18:45,Wow.
00:18:45,00:18:46,I'm pretty sure it would.
00:18:46,00:18:49,"It would probably explode your lungs, but I don't see any reason why it couldn't explode"
00:18:49,00:18:50,your head as well.
00:18:50,00:18:51,Wow.
00:18:51,00:18:55,"I think sound waves become a shock wave, basically, at a certain point, effectively,"
00:18:55,00:19:01,"and they're about 190, where it's then like the, you know, the shock wave that makes a big"
00:19:01,00:19:04,sonic boom.
00:19:04,00:19:08,"But yeah, they apparently also, it doesn't have to be sounds that you can hear."
00:19:08,00:19:14,"So there's infrasound, which is sounds that are out of the range of human hearing frequencies."
00:19:14,00:19:19,"And people have found that if you expose humans to infrasounds that are over 100 decibels,"
00:19:19,00:19:22,they have blood pressure and respiratory rate changes that they can't control.
00:19:22,00:19:25,They just feel their breathing changing.
00:19:25,00:19:29,"And if you take the decibel level high enough, even though they can't even hear the sound,"
00:19:29,00:19:31,their lungs will deflate and inflate.
00:19:31,00:19:36,So it can be used as a means of like artificial respiration if you play this inaudible sound.
00:19:36,00:19:37,It's amazing.
00:19:37,00:19:38,That's so weird.
00:19:38,00:19:43,"So any of these things, loudness is basically how big the amplitude and whatever it is."
00:19:43,00:19:47,"So it could be really, really, really, really loud, but you still can't hear it because"
00:19:47,00:19:48,"it's below, say, 60 Hz."
00:19:48,00:19:49,"Yeah, right."
00:19:49,00:19:53,"And that, to me, that just blows my mind a little bit because how something can be really"
00:19:53,00:19:55,"loud, but you can't hear it."
00:19:55,00:19:56,That just doesn't make any sense.
00:19:56,00:19:57,It's astonishing.
00:19:57,00:19:59,"Well, I don't like it because it can affect you."
00:19:59,00:20:02,Who knows what sounds are being played right now that are screwing with our brains?
00:20:02,00:20:03,No.
00:20:03,00:20:04,"Well, that's what they thought, didn't they?"
00:20:04,00:20:06,In the American Embassy in Cuba or something?
00:20:06,00:20:07,Yeah.
00:20:07,00:20:09,So everyone's feeling sick.
00:20:09,00:20:12,And they thought maybe there's some infrasound kind of weapon they were using.
00:20:12,00:20:14,"I think probably we think that isn't true, right?"
00:20:14,00:20:16,I don't think they could work in fear it.
00:20:16,00:20:17,They've not decided one way or the other.
00:20:17,00:20:19,Or they certainly haven't said if they have.
00:20:19,00:20:21,So loud noise also causes heart disease.
00:20:21,00:20:22,Really?
00:20:22,00:20:23,Yeah.
00:20:23,00:20:25,So it's really strange.
00:20:25,00:20:27,It induces a stress response.
00:20:27,00:20:33,It disrupts your body at a cellular level and it induces a kind of fight or flight response.
00:20:33,00:20:37,"So when the stress hormones increase, that can lead to vascular damage."
00:20:37,00:20:42,"And this happens even if you're asleep, a loud noise will increase your blood pressure."
00:20:42,00:20:43,Wow.
00:20:43,00:20:44,So it's kind of the same.
00:20:44,00:20:48,"Even if you're not hearing it consciously, it just affects the body."
00:20:48,00:20:49,Yeah.
00:20:49,00:20:55,"And every time I've ever walked into a club, I immediately want to run away as fast."
00:20:55,00:20:56,That will be it.
00:20:56,00:20:57,That will be possible.
00:20:57,00:21:01,Did you know the scientists have only just discovered why cocks don't deffin themselves?
00:21:01,00:21:02,Cockrels.
00:21:02,00:21:03,Roles.
00:21:03,00:21:04,Cockrels?
00:21:04,00:21:05,Let's call them roosters.
00:21:05,00:21:08,"So roosters crow at over 100 decibels, which is extremely loud."
00:21:08,00:21:10,It's the same as running a chainsaw right next to your ear.
00:21:10,00:21:11,Wow.
00:21:11,00:21:14,"And we didn't know why they don't just go deaf, why the eardrums don't explode."
00:21:14,00:21:16,And they've looked into them and there are a couple of reasons.
00:21:16,00:21:19,So they've got an eardrum that's surrounded by a nice soft squishy tissue.
00:21:19,00:21:24,"But also, when they tilt their head back to start crowing, then they've got this little"
00:21:24,00:21:28,flap of material which drops down and covers their ear canal completely.
00:21:28,00:21:30,So they've got their own built-in ear plug.
00:21:30,00:21:31,Oh my god.
00:21:31,00:21:35,"Do you remember those dolls that you would get as a kid and as you sat it up, the eyes open"
00:21:35,00:21:37,"and then the way you lay them, the same fingers."
00:21:37,00:21:38,"Yeah, it's exactly the same thing."
00:21:38,00:21:39,The same technology.
00:21:39,00:21:40,Yeah.
00:21:40,00:21:41,Wow.
00:21:41,00:21:42,That is amazing.
00:21:42,00:21:43,It's cool.
00:21:43,00:21:46,It's like being able to stick your fingers in your ears if you don't have fingers.
00:21:46,00:21:52,It's like having a finger inside your ear that you could just kind of maneuver it inside
00:21:52,00:21:54,the ear and stick it in the little canal.
00:21:54,00:21:55,It's exactly like that.
00:21:55,00:21:59,"Hey, you know that song ""Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution"" by AC/DC?"
00:21:59,00:22:00,No.
00:22:00,00:22:01,It's track 10 on Back and Black.
00:22:01,00:22:04,It's one of the more famous songs.
00:22:04,00:22:05,It's a very good one.
00:22:05,00:22:06,Sing it for us.
00:22:06,00:22:07,"No, no, no, no, no, no."
00:22:07,00:22:08,We're not allowed.
00:22:08,00:22:09,For legal reasons.
00:22:09,00:22:10,For legal reasons.
00:22:10,00:22:11,For legal reasons.
00:22:11,00:22:12,For legal reasons.
00:22:12,00:22:13,For legal reasons.
00:22:13,00:22:14,For legal reasons.
00:22:14,00:22:15,"The lyrics are ""Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution""."
00:22:15,00:22:16,Okay.
00:22:16,00:22:20,"The Mississippi State University, who recently tested whether or not ""Rock and Roll"" is"
00:22:20,00:22:23,"or ""Ain't Noise Pollution"" to aphids."
00:22:23,00:22:24,Piss!
00:22:24,00:22:25,"No, sorry."
00:22:25,00:22:26,To beetles.
00:22:26,00:22:27,To beetles.
00:22:27,00:22:30,They played rock two beetles.
00:22:30,00:22:32,There's a beetle called Lady Beetles.
00:22:32,00:22:34,They're living fields and they play on aphids.
00:22:34,00:22:40,"And the scientists played AC/DC at them quite loud, along with some other music."
00:22:40,00:22:44,"And they found that when it was country and folk music, the beetles didn't mind."
00:22:44,00:22:49,"But when it was AC/DC, specifically back in black, the number of aphids they caught was"
00:22:49,00:22:51,cut in half.
00:22:51,00:22:56,And the aphid population rocketed and then the plants in the field were 25% smaller.
00:22:56,00:22:58,"So it has a big impact on farming, basically."
00:22:58,00:23:03,"So they have concluded, they said, as fans of AC/DC, we sadly must disagree with the band"
00:23:03,00:23:07,"and conclude that ""Rock and Roll"" is ""Noise Pollution"" for beetles."
00:23:07,00:23:08,That's so weird.
00:23:08,00:23:10,I find that so weird.
00:23:10,00:23:11,Do you?
00:23:11,00:23:17,"Because I think AC/DC is melodic, as much as we're about to get into the argument about"
00:23:17,00:23:20,whether it's metal or rock.
00:23:20,00:23:22,"No, I just find that a bit odd."
00:23:22,00:23:26,"Yeah, but we don't know what's making them stop eating the aphids."
00:23:26,00:23:28,It might be that they're enjoying the music so much.
00:23:28,00:23:31,They're just kind of bopping around and they don't have time to do that.
00:23:31,00:23:34,"Yeah, or they've gone off to buy the CD or something."
00:23:34,00:23:35,That's possible.
00:23:35,00:23:43,"Just speaking of music, metal, Metallica this year has released a whiskey."
00:23:43,00:23:47,So they're like growing a number of bands that are releasing their own alcohols.
00:23:47,00:23:52,"They've gone for whiskey, but the way that they are distilling the whiskey, the distilling"
00:23:52,00:23:55,"process, is they are playing heavy metal to the whiskey."
00:23:55,00:23:56,Right.
00:23:56,00:23:57,It's very cool.
00:23:57,00:24:02,So it's a process that then they're calling black noise and the idea is it's shaping
00:24:02,00:24:03,the whiskey's flavor.
00:24:03,00:24:10,So they play Metallica's music through a subwoofer and they disrupt the whiskey inside the barrel.
00:24:10,00:24:14,So it's sort of just getting mixed up and mixed up and it's a molecular level of infusion
00:24:14,00:24:15,going on.
00:24:15,00:24:17,"Yeah, what is absolute bullshit."
00:24:17,00:24:18,"No, no, no, no."
00:24:18,00:24:21,"I think they do this all the time to whiskey, don't they?"
00:24:21,00:24:22,There's always they are.
00:24:22,00:24:23,This one's been at the bottom of the sea.
00:24:23,00:24:24,Yeah.
00:24:24,00:24:25,This one's been in space.
00:24:25,00:24:29,"This one's like, can they not just make nice whiskey that people want to buy?"
00:24:29,00:24:30,It's good.
00:24:30,00:24:32,"Listen, I'm getting this from a very, very good source."
00:24:32,00:24:36,This is the press release released by the band.
00:24:36,00:24:42,"And yeah, it it's increased wood interaction that kicks up the wood flavor characteristics"
00:24:42,00:24:43,in the whiskey.
00:24:43,00:24:44,I don't know what that means.
00:24:44,00:24:45,I don't know where the wood bit came in.
00:24:45,00:24:46,The wood comes from the barrel.
00:24:46,00:24:47,For the barrels.
00:24:47,00:24:48,For the barrels.
00:24:48,00:24:52,The whole point is that the wood you use in the barrels sort of reacts with the spirit.
00:24:52,00:24:55,"That's where the taste comes from whiskey, the barrels."
00:24:55,00:25:00,As in they put tasteless alcohol in there and then it's in the barrels for 25 years and
00:25:00,00:25:03,it seeps in all the flavor from the wood and that's where the whiskey plays the sweet.
00:25:03,00:25:05,Is it 25 years for you?
00:25:05,00:25:06,It's over.
00:25:06,00:25:09,That's just a six week whiskey.
00:25:09,00:25:12,And it just gives it a quick dip.
00:25:12,00:25:13,It just gives it a quick dip.

00:26:55,00:26:56,It just gives it a quick dip.
00:26:56,00:26:57,Is that right?
00:26:57,00:26:58,Is that right?
00:26:58,00:26:59,That is...
00:26:59,00:27:00,"I mean, it's not a million miles from what I get."
00:27:00,00:27:01,"Well, there you go."
00:27:01,00:27:02,You're the healthiest.
00:27:02,00:27:07,"It followed 500,000 people over a 10-year period and then looked at who had died at the end of it."
00:27:07,00:27:12,And it found that you reduced your chance of death by 14% of your drinking eight plus cups
00:27:12,00:27:16,of coffee and by 16% if you drink seven cups of coffee a day.
00:27:16,00:27:20,Is it the caffeine that's the good ingredient or is it coffee in general?
00:27:20,00:27:20,Is it the good ingredient or is it coffee in general?
00:27:20,00:27:21,Is it the good ingredient or is it coffee in general?
00:27:21,00:27:22,Is it the good ingredient or is it coffee in general?
00:27:22,00:27:23,Is it the good ingredient or is it coffee in general?
00:27:23,00:27:24,Is it the good ingredient or is it coffee in general?
00:27:24,00:27:25,Is it the good ingredient or is it coffee in general?
00:27:25,00:27:26,Is it the normal coffee?
00:27:26,00:27:27,Would they still be healthy?
00:27:27,00:27:28,And there's no hope here.
00:27:28,00:27:29,Sorry.
00:27:29,00:27:33,"No, they don't know because it's just a statistical study."
00:27:33,00:27:34,It's not a biological study as it was.
00:27:34,00:27:36,They've just looked at who's dead.
00:27:36,00:27:37,Right.
00:27:37,00:27:40,But they've adjusted for other factors as in it could be...
00:27:40,00:27:41,Yes.
00:27:41,00:27:45,"I'm sure they've done all the stuff that scientists are meant to do, like a chance for other mitigating"
00:27:45,00:27:46,factors.
00:27:46,00:27:48,One would hope.
00:27:48,00:27:50,South Korean schools aren't the only place to abandon coffee.
00:27:50,00:27:51,Go on.
00:27:51,00:27:52,Bit of a history.
00:27:52,00:27:54,All of Sweden did in 1746.
00:27:54,00:27:55,Wow.
00:27:55,00:27:56,Yeah.
00:27:56,00:27:57,This was very interesting.
00:27:57,00:28:01,They banned coffee and it was banned by King Gustav III.
00:28:01,00:28:04,And it was banned because they just thought that it was very bad for your health.
00:28:04,00:28:09,So what he wanted to do was ban it and then experiment on it to see whether or not he was
00:28:09,00:28:13,right in his belief or whether or not his advisors who told him that were right in their
00:28:13,00:28:14,belief.
00:28:14,00:28:18,So what they did was they started giving it to convicted criminals to test to see whether
00:28:18,00:28:22,"if they drunk coffee all day, every day or at least, you know, they all ended up being"
00:28:22,00:28:23,beheaded.
00:28:23,00:28:24,So it was included.
00:28:24,00:28:25,Very bad for you.
00:28:25,00:28:28,"Well, here's the thing."
00:28:28,00:28:31,The King ordered an experiment to be done on two identical twins.
00:28:31,00:28:36,"They were both on death row, but they were both put just for life imprisonment if they"
00:28:36,00:28:39,went and did this because they wanted to see how long it could last.
00:28:39,00:28:42,So one was given coffee every day and the other one was given tea.
00:28:42,00:28:46,"And unfortunately, Gustav III died before the experiment finished."
00:28:46,00:28:48,"He was having energy drinks every day, wasn't he?"
00:28:48,00:28:49,Yes.
00:28:49,00:28:50,Exactly.
00:28:50,00:28:51,Yeah.
00:28:51,00:28:54,"No, he was assassinated in 1792."
00:28:54,00:28:55,Sorry.
00:28:55,00:28:56,"Sorry, guys."
00:28:56,00:28:57,Too soon.
00:28:57,00:28:58,Too soon.
00:28:58,00:29:01,"But yeah, we don't fully know what happened."
00:29:01,00:29:07,"Well, no, the really great thing was that so the two doctors were assigned to study the patients,"
00:29:07,00:29:12,"one doctor each, but both the doctors and King Gustav all died before either the tea drinker"
00:29:12,00:29:13,or the coffee drinker.
00:29:13,00:29:14,Yeah.
00:29:14,00:29:15,Great.
00:29:15,00:29:19,I've read an account saying that the tea drinker died first and that the solitary coffee
00:29:19,00:29:23,"drinker, who was meant to be living this unhealthy, life-start drinking coffee, lived longest"
00:29:23,00:29:24,of all of them.
00:29:24,00:29:27,I think there is a question that it's a pocketful tale though.
00:29:27,00:29:28,"I mean, it sounds so neat."
00:29:28,00:29:29,Yeah.
00:29:29,00:29:30,Yeah.
00:29:30,00:29:31,I found somewhere else where it was banned.
00:29:31,00:29:32,Gone.
00:29:32,00:29:34,This is in the Ottoman Empire.
00:29:34,00:29:40,"So there were lots, so it's basically originated for the first time in Yemen in the 15th century,"
00:29:40,00:29:42,"as in grinding the beans, mixing with liquid."
00:29:42,00:29:46,There have been various other attempts to use caffeine beans before that.
00:29:46,00:29:50,"Yemen is, or modern day Yemen, I guess, is where it first appeared."
00:29:50,00:29:51,Same as India's ad.
00:29:51,00:29:52,Really?
00:29:52,00:29:53,Is he from Yemen?
00:29:53,00:29:54,"Yeah, he is."
00:29:54,00:29:55,"He was born there, wasn't he?"
00:29:55,00:29:56,Yeah.
00:29:56,00:30:01,"Well, I thought that might go somewhere different, so."
00:30:01,00:30:06,"He then moved to Bexhillon Sea, which is where comedians like Milligan and those stations"
00:30:06,00:30:09,are ensuring the early bit of the Second World War.
00:30:09,00:30:10,"Where is that, Bexhillon Sea?"
00:30:10,00:30:12,Bexhillon Sea is just near.
00:30:12,00:30:13,It's on the coast.
00:30:13,00:30:15,"It's sort of, you can see France in the distance."
00:30:15,00:30:16,"Oh, on the South Coast."
00:30:16,00:30:17,"Wow, there's some really nice towns here."
00:30:17,00:30:18,Unbelievable.
00:30:18,00:30:20,I've got some stuff here.
00:30:20,00:30:26,"Thank you about Yemen, where he is, I'm trying to say."
00:30:26,00:30:32,"So basically, it became really popular because it was very delicious, but also it was seen"
00:30:32,00:30:36,"as quite dangerous, quite political, because you'd have a coffee house, which is where people"
00:30:36,00:30:39,"meet and they can discuss, and they can discuss politics."
00:30:39,00:30:43,So it's not like meeting at a mosque where things are a bit more police than you're only
00:30:43,00:30:45,there for religious purposes.
00:30:45,00:30:50,"So it's a secular space, and also the coffee was brewed for 20 minutes and it was served"
00:30:50,00:30:54,"very, very hot, so you could only drink it in tiny sips, so you kind of have to chat."
00:30:54,00:31:00,"So the Ottoman Sultan in 1633 cracked down on it, and this is supposedly true, that he"
00:31:00,00:31:05,walked around Istanbul in disguise with a big sword ready to behead anybody he found drinking
00:31:05,00:31:06,coffee.
00:31:06,00:31:07,Is that right?
00:31:07,00:31:09,"Well, this is the story, and again, it may well be apocryphal."
00:31:09,00:31:11,I love the detail of a big sword.
00:31:11,00:31:17,He wasn't turning no fruit knife around.
00:31:17,00:31:24,"It was banned by Frederick the Great, 1781, because he thought that people should be taking"
00:31:24,00:31:27,beer instead of beer gruel instead of coffee.
00:31:27,00:31:30,He thought it was a bit of a luxury.
00:31:30,00:31:31,Beer gruel.
00:31:31,00:31:34,Beer gruel would be like the porridgey stuff that you get at the bottom when you've been
00:31:34,00:31:36,brewing beer.
00:31:36,00:31:39,And he was brought up on that and he thought other people should be having that.
00:31:39,00:31:42,They shouldn't be having this luxurious stuff from Yemen.
00:31:42,00:31:47,"But he actually did himself have coffee, although the difference was he bowled his with instead"
00:31:47,00:31:48,of water champagne.
00:31:48,00:31:49,Yeah.
00:31:49,00:31:50,Wow.
00:31:50,00:31:51,Oh.
00:31:51,00:31:52,That's way to have it.
00:31:52,00:31:53,Would that be nice?
00:31:53,00:31:54,Would it?
00:31:54,00:31:55,Yeah.
00:31:55,00:32:00,"I think after the fourth or fifth cup, you start to enjoy it a bit more."
00:32:00,00:32:09,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show."
00:32:09,00:32:11,And that is Chazinski.
00:32:11,00:32:16,My fact this week is that facial recognition technology for chickens allows you to pre-order
00:32:16,00:32:22,a specific chicken and watch it grow on the farm before it ends up on your plate.
00:32:22,00:32:23,It's actually quite nice.
00:32:23,00:32:28,This is a technology that's just being patented and developed in China.
00:32:28,00:32:31,And it's to make sure that your chicken is totally free range.
00:32:31,00:32:34,"And they've developed really advanced facial recognition technology for chickens, which"
00:32:34,00:32:38,"is about, you know, late '90s percent accuracy."
00:32:38,00:32:40,And so you pre-order your chicken.
00:32:40,00:32:44,"And then I guess four to six months later, once it's waddled about on its nice free range"
00:32:44,00:32:48,"farm for a while, and you've been able to check it every once in a while, then you get"
00:32:48,00:32:49,to eat it.
00:32:49,00:32:50,You check in on it.
00:32:50,00:32:51,"Check, check."
00:32:51,00:32:52,You check.
00:32:52,00:32:53,You check in on it.
00:32:53,00:32:57,"Well, yeah, facial recognition is going to be everywhere, isn't it?"
00:32:57,00:33:01,"Well, the technology seems, yeah, really advanced in some areas and really crap in others."
00:33:01,00:33:06,"For instance, there was the trial at the 2017 Champions League final in Cardiff, where"
00:33:06,00:33:10,"it was revealed that it'd wrongly identified more than 2,000 people."
00:33:10,00:33:16,"So the technology flagged up 2,470 people as potential criminals by comparing them to a"
00:33:16,00:33:18,database of potential criminals.
00:33:18,00:33:22,"It turned out 2,297 of those flags were false positives."
00:33:22,00:33:24,"Well, it's still sub-positive, though."
00:33:24,00:33:25,Some positives.
00:33:25,00:33:30,I think the police at the moment have a 98% false positive rate for their facial recognition
00:33:30,00:33:31,technology.
00:33:31,00:33:35,"No, but those, the South Wales police, they've been improving that technology since the"
00:33:35,00:33:36,Champions League final.
00:33:36,00:33:42,"I think they switched to a new algorithm and at a recent event, they only got 10 false"
00:33:42,00:33:46,"positives, which was 0.02% of the total number of matches."
00:33:46,00:33:47,I'm skeptical.
00:33:47,00:33:50,So I went to an exhibition last night at Somerset House.
00:33:50,00:33:51,It's really good.
00:33:51,00:33:55,It's basically a massive design exhibition that's taken over the whole thing.
00:33:55,00:33:56,It's on for a few weeks.
00:33:56,00:33:59,Each country has its own room and design piece.
00:33:59,00:34:03,And the American one was testing facial recognition.
00:34:03,00:34:08,"So I had a go and it asks you to sit in a chair and it scans your face and it does lots of,"
00:34:08,00:34:12,"you know, investigating your face, everything about it, and then tells you how old it thinks"
00:34:12,00:34:14,"you are, whether you're male or female, all that kind of thing."
00:34:14,00:34:18,And you're skeptical about this because I think you're a hundred and seventy-five-year-old
00:34:18,00:34:19,tartarist.
00:34:19,00:34:20,"Oh, yeah."
00:34:20,00:34:26,"It wasn't quite that wrong, but it asked me to try and look really angry."
00:34:26,00:34:27,And so I did.
00:34:27,00:34:28,I tried really hard.
00:34:28,00:34:29,"You know, I put loads of angry faces."
00:34:29,00:34:30,I see those faces.
00:34:30,00:34:31,I see those faces.
00:34:31,00:34:32,You've all seen those faces a lot.
00:34:32,00:34:35,"Give us a fake, angry face that you were giving it."
00:34:35,00:34:36,"Oh, that."
00:34:36,00:34:43,"To me, it's screaming constipation."
00:34:43,00:34:52,"But basically, then, I guess what expression I was trying to do, and it said calm, and then"
00:34:52,00:34:53,it gets my age.
00:34:53,00:34:55,And I was there with my friend.
00:34:55,00:34:56,She did it and I did it.
00:34:56,00:34:57,It said it.
00:34:57,00:35:02,"It thought I was a female age 15 to 20, which is extremely flashing, but I'm not the kind"
00:35:02,00:35:03,of person.
00:35:03,00:35:05,"I mean, no one has wrinkles between 15 and 20."
00:35:05,00:35:07,Why can't it spot that?
00:35:07,00:35:11,And it said my poor friend was a female age 55 to 65.
00:35:11,00:35:12,Who's my age?
00:35:12,00:35:16,So I think the average they got it right.
00:35:16,00:35:17,Pretty much.
00:35:17,00:35:18,Right.
00:35:18,00:35:20,Is that what they're going for?
00:35:20,00:35:23,"In Finland, they're testing a new technology."
00:35:23,00:35:27,"So the idea is that when you walk into a shop, they're developing scanners that when you"
00:35:27,00:35:33,"walk in up to the till, you give a meaningful nod, as it says in the quotes, that's how they've"
00:35:33,00:35:37,"said in this video, you give a meaningful nod to the scanner, and that's how you pay."
00:35:37,00:35:41,"And it's memorized through, in the same way, with your bank card details, your face is"
00:35:41,00:35:42,going on.
00:35:42,00:35:43,"Creepy, creepy, creepy, creepy."
00:35:43,00:35:44,Yeah.
00:35:44,00:35:47,"I am going to trick all this facial recognition stuff, and I found out a method I can do."
00:35:47,00:35:49,I deliberately disfiguring your own face.
00:35:49,00:35:50,That's right.
00:35:50,00:35:55,So it turns out that you can't trick good facial recognition systems by wearing makeup.
00:35:55,00:36:00,"Even if you're wearing weird goth style makeup, it doesn't work."
00:36:00,00:36:04,"But there is a guy online, and his name is Taki on, that's his Twitter account, he has"
00:36:04,00:36:12,"found that the kind of makeup worn by fans of the insane clown posse, aka Juggalos, right?"
00:36:12,00:36:18,"They wear very heavy clown makeup, and it completely redefines what the computer sees"
00:36:18,00:36:19,as your jawline.
00:36:19,00:36:24,"So we may still see people wearing clown masks for bank robberies, but they'll just be"
00:36:24,00:36:26,wearing clown makeup instead.
00:36:26,00:36:27,That's very clever.
00:36:27,00:36:28,Oh.
00:36:28,00:36:29,"But they tried to train them up, didn't they?"
00:36:29,00:36:35,"Recently, I think you mentioned fleetingly in a podcast a few months ago, Andy, that the"
00:36:35,00:36:42,"South Wales Police sent facial recognition AI to a massive Elvis impersonator festival,"
00:36:42,00:36:46,"the biggest one in the world, in order to hone its techniques to see if it could distinguish"
00:36:46,00:36:47,between different Elvis impersonators.
00:36:47,00:36:52,"Oh, speaking of Elvis, I've been reading up on him recently."
00:36:52,00:36:57,"I was reading this one article that was published on the enemy, and it's one of those things"
00:36:57,00:37:01,"that we don't usually naturally go to when we're doing our research, you know, something"
00:37:01,00:37:07,"that's like 101 amazing things that you'll, but this article called 75 geeky facts you"
00:37:07,00:37:09,might not know about Elvis Presley.
00:37:09,00:37:12,And it was genuinely incredible every time I give this one.
00:37:12,00:37:13,"Okay, here's one."
00:37:13,00:37:18,The inspiration for Elvis Presley's trademark jumpsuit and quiff look was a comic book hero
00:37:18,00:37:23,Captain Marvel Jr. is what inspired Elvis Presley's look.
00:37:23,00:37:28,This is the geekiest foundations for what it seemed to be the coolest singer of the 1950s
00:37:28,00:37:31,"and so did he say that was, did he used to read them?"
00:37:31,00:37:35,"He must have, as a kid, yeah, he was obsessed with them, I believe, when he was younger."
00:37:35,00:37:38,And so that's what he based his look on.
00:37:38,00:37:42,"Here's another one just before he died, Elvis commissioned his stage electrician to design"
00:37:42,00:37:46,"a version of his big white jumpsuit that he wore, which would fire laser beams into"
00:37:46,00:37:49,the audience from the suit.
00:37:49,00:37:50,"I mean, that's incredible."
00:37:50,00:37:51,I've not heard that before.
00:37:51,00:37:52,Do you know Elvis?
00:37:52,00:37:54,"He, Elvis impersonators."
00:37:54,00:38:00,"Do you know the first Elvis impersonator was in 1954, which is two years before Elvis's"
00:38:00,00:38:01,first hit single?
00:38:01,00:38:02,What?
00:38:02,00:38:06,This guy was called Carl Cheesy Nelson.
00:38:06,00:38:07,That is.
00:38:07,00:38:08,Cheesy.
00:38:08,00:38:09,Cheesy.
00:38:09,00:38:10,It was his nickname.
00:38:10,00:38:11,That was his middle name.
00:38:11,00:38:12,Okay.
00:38:12,00:38:17,"And basically, what had happened was Elvis had been delayed for a show and this guy was"
00:38:17,00:38:18,a really good friend of Elvis.
00:38:18,00:38:22,And so he did the whole show just copying his entire style.
00:38:22,00:38:23,That's so cool.
00:38:23,00:38:24,"So, yeah, that's amazing."
00:38:24,00:38:25,That's amazing.
00:38:25,00:38:26,That's so funny.
00:38:26,00:38:31,"Just while we're on impersonators, and again, from this NME article, really fascinating."
00:38:31,00:38:36,"In Somalia, going to strict Islamic law, Elvis impersonators are required to have beards."
00:38:36,00:38:37,Right.
00:38:37,00:38:38,So you can do everything.
00:38:38,00:38:40,"And I'm reading these facts word for word, I should say."
00:38:40,00:38:42,It's such a brilliant article.
00:38:42,00:38:45,Just one more thing I found really interesting about facial recognition.
00:38:45,00:38:46,"Oh, yeah."
00:38:46,00:38:50,Do you know that shops in London have it specifically for celebrities?
00:38:50,00:38:55,"So a bunch of stores in London, more than a dozen stores in 2013, installed this technology,"
00:38:55,00:39:01,"which is VIP facial recognition technology, to stop that moment when someone super famous"
00:39:01,00:39:02,walks in.
00:39:02,00:39:06,"And as a shop assistant, you're supposed to be really kind of nice and sequest to them,"
00:39:06,00:39:07,but you don't know who they are.
00:39:07,00:39:12,"So it has a database of all celebrities' faces, and as soon as a celebrity walks in, then"
00:39:12,00:39:16,"a thing pops up on these guys' tills that says, ""Oh, Julia Roberts has just entered the"
00:39:16,00:39:17,"building."""
00:39:17,00:39:21,"And also with a bit of info about her, like, she is this size, and she likes this style of"
00:39:21,00:39:24,"thing, and go and force her to buy some shit."
00:39:24,00:39:29,If only Hugh Grant had had that in Notting Hill when Julia Roberts walked into his bookshop.
00:39:29,00:39:30,"Oh, if only."
00:39:30,00:39:32,They could have done the whole film in half an hour.
00:39:32,00:39:33,You're so right.
00:39:33,00:39:38,"And he would have sold her a book she actually wanted to buy, because it would have had a preferences."
00:39:38,00:39:40,I have a thing about facial recognition and celebrities.
00:39:40,00:39:42,This is weirdly similar to that.
00:39:42,00:39:50,"So still on the tricking facial recognition thing, there are specially designed glasses"
00:39:50,00:39:55,which can make facial recognition computers think that you are Miller Yovervitch.
00:39:55,00:39:56,Who?
00:39:56,00:39:57,Miller Yovervitch?
00:39:57,00:39:58,"Yeah, Miller Yovervitch."
00:39:58,00:39:59,She's in the fifth element.
00:39:59,00:40:04,"She's a model slash actor, resident, she's in all six of the resident evil movies, and"
00:40:04,00:40:06,she does a brilliant job at them.
00:40:06,00:40:08,So they only tell you when it's her?
00:40:08,00:40:09,"No, no, no."
00:40:09,00:40:13,They make the computer think that you are Miller Yovervitch.
00:40:13,00:40:14,Got it.
00:40:14,00:40:15,So it's really bizarre.
00:40:15,00:40:18,"They've got, they can be made up to look like normal tortoise glasses, but on the front"
00:40:18,00:40:23,"of the rims, they've got these specially printed images, okay?"
00:40:23,00:40:27,And the frames kind of overlay the face with pixels.
00:40:27,00:40:31,"And when the computer looks at you, it's calculations are disturbed and it thinks that you are"
00:40:31,00:40:34,someone else in its database.
00:40:34,00:40:35,And I think there are limits.
00:40:35,00:40:39,"As in I think you, you might have to be a woman, for example, with that, with a slightly"
00:40:39,00:40:43,"different bone structure, or you might need to be white as Miller Yovervitch."
00:40:43,00:40:50,"Do you think wholesale people might start robbing banks, looking like Miller Yovervitch?"
00:40:50,00:40:51,What an idea.
00:40:51,00:40:52,Yeah.
00:40:52,00:40:53,"And then she's just going to get arrested, obviously."
00:40:53,00:40:54,Yeah.
00:40:54,00:41:04,Just be her in the insane clown posse in prison.
00:41:04,00:41:05,Okay.
00:41:05,00:41:06,That is it.
00:41:06,00:41:07,That is all of our facts.
00:41:07,00:41:08,Thank you so much for listening.
