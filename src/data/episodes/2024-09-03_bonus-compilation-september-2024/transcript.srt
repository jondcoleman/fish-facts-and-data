00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
 Hey Clubfish members, Dan here and welcome to your secret bonus content that you get as part of your membership.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:12,000
 Today we have a compilation episode for you, so these are all the bits that just didn't quite fit into the episodes,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,600
 the tangents that we would go on that don't quite fit the shape of the show, but they're all great bits,

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,400
 and so we bung 'em all together here for you to listen to.

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,100
 So I hope you enjoy it, I hope that we get to meet some of you Clubfishers out on the road.

6
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,100
 Our tour is beginning properly as of this Friday.

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:32,600
 We are going to be in Bristol with our Thunder Nerds tour, and then we're going over to Dublin the next week,

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,000
 and then there's more UK dates.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 If you want to come and see us live, no such thing as TheFish.com.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,300
 You can find links to all the tickets there, so go check that out.

11
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:46,800
 We've been road testing some material for the whole show as the extra bits that you get as the live audience,

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,300
 and it's so fun.

13
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,700
 There's going to be quizzes, audience interaction, we've got special guests, it's going to be awesome.

14
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:59,300
 So do come along if you can, check out the list of where we're going and get your ticket.

15
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,500
 Alright, well let's get on with this week's compilation.

16
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,100
 You are going to be hearing about Space Monks,

17
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,400
 you're going to be hearing about Japanese scissors known as knob cutters,

18
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,600
 and you're going to be hearing about insanely long-lasting pagodas.

19
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,100
 Let's do it, on with the show!

20
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:28,500
 [Music]

21
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:36,300
 I've got a couple of things just to do with other efforts of combining monks and space together as a thing.

22
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:41,400
 There is a lot of research that's currently going on by scientists who are trying to work out

23
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,100
 how can we get to places like Mars when you've got a human body that might go into,

24
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:51,700
 you know, they're trying to work out can we put you into hibernation, all that sort of stuff for deep space travel.

25
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:57,100
 And a lot of them are looking into monks and how they can take their bodies to extreme places,

26
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,200
 how they can lower their heart rates to basically a hibernating state and so on.

27
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,200
 And the Dalai Lama has loaned out hundreds of monks to science communities in Russia

28
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,500
 who are currently studying them to see if they can get astronauts to emulate this kind of hibernation.

29
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,900
 Did they consent to that? I don't know if I'd agree to be loaned out to a Russian science community.

30
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,400
 Yeah, you go where your Lama sends you.

31
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,300
 Yeah, so that's an effort that's going on right now

32
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:27,600
 because they can take the body to places that are quite remarkable with meditation as we've talked about before.

33
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,800
 Do you have to stay meditating for the whole, what is it, year-long journey to Mars?

34
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,700
 That feels like extreme, that feels very difficult to me.

35
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,900
 Yeah, definitely, right? I'm very distractible.

36
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,800
 I think it's only a few months to Mars.

37
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,100
 Really? I think so.

38
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,200
 I don't think it's a year, yeah.

39
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,600
 So you get that Buzz Aldrin cycle thing there.

40
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,900
 Yeah, all right.

41
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,300
 But I would still be tempted to look at my phone halfway through.

42
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,100
 I would.

43
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,900
 Where are you going to get a signal halfway between,

44
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,500
 "Oh, we're at a Lagrange point. Hold your phone up in the air."

45
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,800
 Exactly, yeah.

46
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,800
 If it's in front of me, I will just be looking at it, you know.

47
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,100
 But that monks probably don't keep their phones in front of them.

48
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,200
 That's probably another element of being a monk.

49
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,600
 So they aren't doing a thing where they're trying to work out

50
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,200
 if they can sort of, as through drug induction,

51
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,300
 whether they can drug induce a torpor,

52
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,400
 which is a type of hibernation, right?

53
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,800
 So the idea is that the astronauts going to Mars

54
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,700
 would have to really stock up on food,

55
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,900
 put on a lot of weight, which they could shed over that period.

56
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,800
 Yeah, exactly.

57
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,500
 Dude, like Grizzly Bear, for instance, when they go into topper,

58
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,200
 they put a plug in their anuses

59
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,600
 so that they don't defecate like of hair and mud and stuff like that.

60
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,100
 Do you think the astronauts might do that?

61
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,300
 I think if they did, they might not tell us.

62
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,200
 That'll be it.

63
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,300
 The bears put it there.

64
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,100
 I always thought it just kind of built up.

65
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,300
 The bears don't shove anything.

66
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,400
 I thought it sort of appeared as well,

67
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,100
 the tap-tap it, whatever it's called.

68
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,500
 They're just shoving the mud.

69
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,700
 But I've never thought about it.

70
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,500
 Rebecca, reach with this.

71
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,500
 Oh, what, this plug?

72
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,000
 No, it just imponds itself.

73
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,900
 I'll use that excuse.

74
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,100
 In 2000, and I had not realized,

75
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,500
 I had forgotten one of the causes of that.

76
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,400
 A brilliantly successful election in America,

77
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,700
 which I'm sure everyone remembers,

78
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,600
 was the butterfly ballots,

79
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,500
 which was, I don't know if you've seen these,

80
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,800
 but it's in Florida,

81
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,000
 where obviously it was where they had to have a massive recap

82
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,900
 between Gore and Burton.

83
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,000
 It's always been very controversial.

84
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,900
 Exactly.

85
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,700
 In Florida, they had butterfly ballots,

86
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,000
 and if you look at them,

87
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,800
 they're completely misaligned.

88
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,500
 So if you voted for one candidate,

89
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,700
 if you read a candidate's name,

90
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,500
 and in this case, it was actually if you read the Democrat's name,

91
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,300
 so if you followed Gore's name along,

92
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,400
 and you ticked the first box that you came to,

93
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,800
 that was actually a vote for Pappy Cannon,

94
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,400
 because they misaligned the boxes by the names.

95
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,500
 Oh, you had one job.

96
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,600
 Oh, no.

97
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,600
 I mean, how much of it

98
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,400
 surely goes into the most important Democratic moment

99
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,700
 in every four years?

100
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,000
 And they fucked it up,

101
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,700
 and they calculated that about 2,000 people

102
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,100
 must have made that mistake,

103
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,500
 and that was more than the majority that Bush got.

104
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,200
 So, but how does that happen?

105
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,500
 How does no one look at that and go, guys?

106
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,300
 Is this legit?

107
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,500
 That's crazy.

108
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,300
 In America, I actually hadn't realized

109
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,900
 how long electronic voting has been around.

110
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,100
 It's extraordinary, since it's the 19th century.

111
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,200
 We are behind the curve in Britain compared to those guys,

112
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,600
 and they're so beautiful,

113
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,900
 the really old voting machine.

114
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,200
 So the first one was kind of invented

115
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,600
 in the very late 19th century,

116
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,800
 and it's lever-operated,

117
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,100
 and you can look up pictures,

118
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,400
 but basically, it was calculated at the time

119
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,900
 that it had more moving parts than any other machine

120
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,500
 in the country, like more than cars at the time.

121
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,700
 And it was the most complicated machine there was.

122
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,400
 And so there'll be lots of candidates here

123
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,700
 at this big metal machine

124
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,400
 that looks like a really old arcade game or something.

125
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,400
 And each candidate has a mini lever next to their name,

126
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,700
 or if you know that you're just going to vote

127
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,900
 along party lines on everything,

128
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,300
 then you've got a big lever,

129
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,600
 which is Democrat or a big lever,

130
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,700
 which is Republican.

131
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,300
 You can just pull them.

132
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,300
 And then behind the scenes,

133
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,800
 it's got to be incredibly complicated,

134
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,100
 because all the mini levers

135
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,700
 have to connect to the relevant major lever.

136
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,700
 And also, your vote isn't registered

137
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,800
 until you pull the final lever,

138
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,100
 which opens the curtain,

139
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,700
 which has been around you for privacy,

140
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,200
 to escape, and it's when you pull the curtain.

141
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,100
 - So we're looking for a four-digit number.

142
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,200
 Like, I've got a lot of color here.

143
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,800
 I've got four colors.

144
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,100
 Come on, guys, we can work this out.

145
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,200
 - The ceiling is slowly sinking towards me.

146
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,300
 - Sounds chaotic.

147
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,700
 - You know what I wonder about that?

148
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,900
 You know how does this thing,

149
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,300
 that if your name is closer to the top of the ballot,

150
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,300
 that people vote for you,

151
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,400
 or more likely to vote for you?

152
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,000
 - Okay.

153
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,700
 - I wonder if you've got two levers.

154
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,600
 - Oh, yeah.

155
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,800
 - Were the right-handed people

156
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,200
 are more likely to pull the right one?

157
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,000
 - Definitely not.

158
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,700
 - Definitely not.

159
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,500
 - Well, unfortunately,

160
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,000
 it's usually a mix-up with the makeup machine.

161
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,400
 The Democrat lever actually votes you Republican.

162
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,100
 - But no, I bet that would be the case.

163
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:47,800
 - It feels like it.

164
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,500
 - I bet so.

165
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,600
 - If I'm right-handed,

166
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,200
 and I'm pulling the left lever,

167
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,900
 I'm way more likely to half pull it,

168
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,000
 and then my hands slip off,

169
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,500
 and not pull the left lever.

170
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,100
 - And then it spoils your ballot.

171
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,000
 That sounds like a terrible system.

172
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,700
 As in the little pencil genuinely does,

173
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,800
 it works very, very well.

174
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,500
 - Or a permanent ink in my case

175
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,200
 so that people don't rub out my votes,

176
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,300
 because I know that happens.

177
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,800
 - The last thing I voted at,

178
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,400
 the lady in front of me,

179
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,100
 got told, "Yeah, there's your booth.

180
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,000
 There's a pencil in the booth."

181
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,200
 And she said, "Can I borrow your pen?"

182
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,200
 And I said, "Yeah."

183
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,800
 And she said, "Good. Can't rub out pen."

184
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,900
 And she was one of the truthers.

185
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,800
 - I remember when I was at primary school,

186
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,300
 you used to buy robbers that could rub out ink.

187
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,600
 - Well, exactly.

188
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,000
 That is the worst conspiracy theory of modern times,

189
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,600
 is that why wouldn't you just print more ballot papers

190
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,500
 and fill them out?

191
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,300
 Why would you have a team,

192
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,300
 a secret team of children with robbers

193
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,300
 in a backroom somewhere,

194
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,200
 rubbing out people's votes?

195
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,600
 Anyway, never mind that.

196
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,000
 - And then she went on to vote Lydden.

197
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,200
 - Do you think there's anything, as you were saying,

198
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,800
 with a name being higher on the ballot and so on?

199
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,200
 Is there any research, I wonder,

200
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,000
 about names being familiar names to people that you know?

201
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,700
 So for example, I felt quite warm to Sean Kemp

202
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,900
 that you mentioned just now

203
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,800
 because he's one of the greatest basketball players

204
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,700
 of all time.

205
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,700
 And name association often is a thing, isn't it?

206
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,500
 - Wait, not the former Lydden press head of press.

207
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,500
 We all remember his name.

208
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,200
 - He's one of the best basketball players of all time.

209
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,400
 - Namesake. They show names.

210
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,100
 - I see. I see. Okay.

211
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,100
 - We don't know.

212
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,700
 We're the same person.

213
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,000
 - We do. That's true.

214
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,800
 - That's interesting.

215
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,100
 I think, like, I remember in the Ukrainian election,

216
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,600
 the last one that Ukraine had,

217
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,800
 they had a lot of candidates

218
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,400
 who had very, very similar names, didn't they?

219
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:23,900
 Do you remember that?

220
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,900
 - They named themselves Zelensky, didn't they?

221
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,300
 - I think they'd be Zelensky with two Ys.

222
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,200
 All of them would be Zelensky with an E and an E.

223
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,500
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

224
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,300
 I think that's definitely true, Dan.

225
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,200
 If I see a name of someone I admire,

226
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,900
 I'll be lucky to think one of them.

227
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,500
 - Yeah.

228
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,800
 - If I saw a Dan or James or an Anna in the polling booth.

229
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,500
 - Don't need to say which way you think.

230
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,100
 - I had no idea that hunters have to wear high vis.

231
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,900
 - Yeah, it's to stop them from shooting each other.

232
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,800
 - Well, that makes sense.

233
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,700
 But I just thought, I just, I think of a hunter.

234
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,100
 I think of someone who I haven't seen at all, actually.

235
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,100
 Do you know who he is?

236
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:01,800
 - He's a camouflage.

237
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,800
 - You think of a tree.

238
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,700
 You look at every tree and you think, could be a hunter.

239
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,900
 - Could be absolutely stuffed with hunters.

240
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,700
 And I know it's not.

241
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,900
 So I'm able to go camping with a bit more reassurance.

242
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,400
 - I think so.

243
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,200
 These are like sport hunters, I suppose.

244
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,200
 So they're not like, they are trying to get the animals,

245
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,300
 but they're more...

246
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:15,700
 - I see.

247
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,800
 But if they're a trained government assassins after me,

248
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,900
 they may not necessarily be bound by the same rules.

249
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,500
 - Exactly.

250
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,600
 - Okay, okay, okay, okay.

251
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:21,900
 I get that.

252
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,500
 - But I think it's unlikely.

253
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,500
 Although actually probably in, you know,

254
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,800
 parts of London where we live,

255
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,100
 someone in a high vis jacket would blend in,

256
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:34,200
 especially with the potholes that they have to continuously mend

257
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,800
 and the road works always in North London.

258
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,500
 - I'll tell you what, actually.

259
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,300
 Tell you what, the election going on,

260
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,900
 all these politicians going around high vis.

261
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,700
 Probably, you know, you see someone in high vis.

262
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,600
 You think it's a builder.

263
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,100
 It's probably a candidate for an office, you know,

264
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,100
 trying to pretend to be a working man, you know.

265
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:50,800
 - Damn, you're good at that.

266
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,100
 (all laughing)

267
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,300
 - Keep digging.

268
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,600
 Keep drilling.

269
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,000
 - Do you think this is creepy, by the way?

270
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,900
 Sorry, this is all going back to the last section,

271
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,100
 but speaking of candidates going around knocking on doors.

272
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,000
 You know, people have got smart doorbells now.

273
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,400
 - Yeah.

274
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,300
 - And politicians are saying it's quite useful

275
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,200
 because you can speak to someone

276
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,200
 even when they're not in the country.

277
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,500
 So you ring their doorbell and I think a Lib Dem candidate

278
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,900
 said someone answered from a sunbed in Spain.

279
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,300
 And then said another person answered from their bath.

280
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,300
 And they had a nice chat with them

281
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,000
 about who they were going to vote for.

282
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,200
 - All right, you know, going to Spain,

283
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,200
 but probably thanks to Brexit,

284
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,600
 not hardly anyone's in Spain these days.

285
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,300
 - There we go, there we go.

286
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,500
 And you brought it home.

287
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,800
 (all laughing)

288
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,800
 - I'm going to be to set James up like that.

289
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,300
 - We've hit that oil, but I knew it was down there somewhere.

290
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,600
 - But yeah, you did get cats in Egypt, of course.

291
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,600
 - Indeed.

292
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,700
 - The mother of all cats was Bastet.

293
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,600
 And in theory, all cats have a little bit of her in them.

294
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,600
 - Today, is she a kind of cat god all the time?

295
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,100
 - Yeah, yeah.

296
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,500
 - She's like the Genghis kind of cats.

297
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,700
 - Exactly, all cats are little Bastets.

298
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,300
 (all laughing)

299
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,900
 - Was she a real historical cat?

300
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,900
 Or is she in mythology?

301
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,500
 - She's the goddess of, you know,

302
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,000
 with the cat face and the human body.

303
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,900
 - Got it.

304
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,400
 - That's cool.

305
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,700
 - They have a quite an interesting role in Hebrew

306
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,700
 and Islamic texts as well,

307
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,100
 which is that they didn't exist until the Ark.

308
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:19,200
 So they were created on the Ark.

309
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,000
 - Really?

310
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,800
 - So this is not according to Christian beliefs,

311
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,800
 but yeah, Hebrew and Islam believe that we're on the Ark.

312
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,000
 They've got a mouse problem.

313
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,200
 Some of the old texts say that the mouse was created

314
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,000
 because a pig sneezed and it came out of the pig's nose.

315
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,300
 Anyway, there's a mouse problem on the Ark.

316
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,700
 Everyone's like, Noah, what are we going to do about this mouse?

317
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,400
 And Noah rubbed his hand over the lion's head a few times

318
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,700
 and the lion sneezed out some cats.

319
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,600
 - What text is this?

320
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,200
 Is this Hebrew and Islamic?

321
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,800
 - Ancient Hebrew and Islamic texts.

322
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,200
 - So it's not in the Old Testament,

323
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,200
 but it's in the versions of the Old Testament.

324
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,000
 - Exactly, it's in other bits of scripture.

325
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,700
 - And it's quite the story.

326
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,700
 - I was really trying to find the very original source

327
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,300
 that they did back to, but it is like, yeah,

328
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,500
 going back to like six.

329
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,900
 - Well, there's a cuneiform, isn't there?

330
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,200
 That what's his name found?

331
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,100
 - Irving Finkel.

332
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,800
 - Irving Finkel, which is the earliest text about the Ark.

333
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,000
 - Maybe that's a little picture on it

334
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,600
 of a lion sneezing out a kissin.

335
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,300
 - They're such a mad sort of robes

336
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,300
 and otherwise very credible.

337
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,800
 - Right, yeah, of course.

338
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,600
 - When they were putting together the Old Testament,

339
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,600
 they must have been like, are we going to do the sneezing bit?

340
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,200
 No, Noah's going to believe that.

341
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,900
 - Actually, Muhammad loved cats.

342
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,500
 There's another story which I really like

343
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,900
 where he had to go to pray and had to put his prayer cloak on

344
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,100
 and he saw a cat was sleeping on it.

345
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,500
 So rather than wake up the cat,

346
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,400
 he cut off the arm of his cloak

347
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,700
 and took it away without waking the cat.

348
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,700
 - That's clever.

349
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,700
 - And also very much a symbol of sort of cats' relationships

350
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,500
 with humans.

351
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,300
 - Yeah, what, just sort of do what they say?

352
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,700
 - Yeah, they'll do what they want.

353
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,800
 - Yeah, they do what they want.

354
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,300
 We work around them.

355
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,900
 Do you know the most expensive pair of knob cutters?

356
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,700
 - Oh, no. - Oh, bonsai scissors.

357
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,500
 - No. - I think this is the most expensive.

358
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,500
 They're made by Yasuhiro Hirakawa,

359
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,700
 who is a fifth generation bonsai scissor maker.

360
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:06,500
 And he has one pair that go for $35,000,

361
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,100
 but usually sells them for about $1,100.

362
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,000
 And it's one of those--

363
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,300
 - Is it one of those tourist things?

364
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,500
 Like I spent so much money on like novelty chopsticks

365
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,400
 when I went to Japan.

366
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,200
 - Yeah, probably.

367
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,500
 And then for normal Japanese people,

368
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,500
 they're just on sale in Asda.

369
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,100
 No, it's great 'cause it's so typical Japanese

370
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,700
 where they take so much care

371
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,200
 and go to such extreme lengths.

372
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,500
 So there's a bonsai craftsman called Masakazu Yoshikawa

373
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,600
 who I watched an interview with.

374
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,300
 And he gets his scissors bespoke made by this scissor maker.

375
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,100
 And he says, he'll get on the phone, Tim,

376
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,700
 spend an hour explaining exactly what he wants to do.

377
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,500
 You know, the kind of tree, exactly the thing.

378
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,600
 - That's a boring hour for Mr.--

379
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,900
 Did you say Hirakawa?

380
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,800
 - Describe exactly the kind of knob he wants to cut.

381
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,700
 - Hirakawa's taking notes.

382
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,700
 - Yeah, okay, so it's a knob on the tree, isn't it?

383
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,900
 Yeah.

384
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,700
 Okay.

385
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,900
 Yeah.

386
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,700
 - But you don't get one hour later, right?

387
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,100
 - No, I do, yeah, I have actually done this before, yeah.

388
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,800
 (laughing)

389
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,500
 - Well, he's actually--

390
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,800
 - I'm gonna charge you $30,000 for these.

391
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,000
 We normally sell them at a 98% discount to all our customers.

392
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,700
 - He's not the one you should feel sorry for.

393
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,500
 'Cause then Parod Masakazu has to wait up to a year.

394
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,600
 - Who's that, sorry?

395
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,600
 - The person who's ordered the scissors.

396
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,800
 Then he says, you know, then Hirakawa will say,

397
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,300
 well, I need to research that.

398
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,600
 There'll be a lot of information there.

399
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,100
 It'll take six months to a year.

400
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,900
 - It is hard to research knobs on the internet.

401
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,300
 (laughing)

402
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,000
 He has to scroll through lots of pages of Google

403
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,900
 before he finds out these three knobs.

404
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,800
 - Developed a massive porn addiction.

405
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,200
 (laughing)

406
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,900
 - Yep, spends 11 months looking at porn

407
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,700
 and then a month making some scissors.

408
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,200
 - You know those lances that you get

409
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,900
 when someone's unveiling something?

410
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,300
 - Oh yeah, the novelty.

411
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,000
 - They don't look very sharp, though.

412
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,200
 - I don't think they are.

413
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,100
 I think, I don't know.

414
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,500
 - Oh, they're sharp enough for a ribbon.

415
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,340
 - There's some, there's some--

416
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,600
 - Winners really aren't that hard.

417
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,300
 - They can't do, they can't do microsurgery

418
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,140
 or anything like that.

419
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:01,960
 But why would you want them to?

420
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,500
 But they normally, they're--

421
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,700
 - Your doctor brought those out during microsurgery.

422
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,700
 (laughing)

423
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,300
 - They're just going, "This is--"

424
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,100
 - Yeah, the last thing you see is you're doing the couch

425
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,100
 for the anesthesia.

426
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,800
 - But normally you hire them.

427
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,100
 I guess because why on earth

428
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,200
 would you want to keep a two foot long pair of scissors.

429
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,200
 It's just, but there is--

430
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,100
 - There can't be many in the country.

431
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,000
 There aren't many in the country, James, I'm so glad.

432
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,500
 So there's, in the UK,

433
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,300
 there's unveilingcurtains.co.uk.

434
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,300
 They say no unveiling ceremony is complete

435
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,000
 without a pair of our giant ceremony ribbon scissors.

436
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,500
 But in America, there's goldenopenings.com.

437
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,900
 - Oh, I saw their website, really great.

438
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,500
 - Yeah, and what were you Googling when you found that?

439
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,900
 (laughing)

440
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,200
 - Well, I'd finished Googling, obviously, though.

441
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,600
 - But they are 40 inches long.

442
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,700
 They advertise themselves

443
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,900
 as the largest working scissors in the world.

444
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,800
 And they, you can hire those for $75,

445
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,100
 which is pretty good.

446
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,200
 - You can also hire a stand.

447
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,700
 - No, that's the thing, they sell you the stand.

448
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,400
 - What, you can't hire the stand?

449
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,700
 - I believe not.

450
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,800
 - Oh my gosh. - 'Cause you display stand,

451
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,100
 which you have to buy,

452
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,400
 and then you hire the scissors for $75.

453
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,100
 - What else can you use a display stand for

454
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,600
 after you've had to give the scissors back?

455
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,900
 - Nothing.

456
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,500
 - I've got some bigger scissors than that.

457
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,700
 - Have you? - Yeah, demolition shears.

458
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,200
 - Cool.

459
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,800
 - Get a corner building in there.

460
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,600
 - Pretty much, yeah. - What?

461
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,000
 - With 34 meters in length. - What?

462
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,200
 - Attached to a massive excavator arm.

463
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,600
 These are used for cutting their way

464
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,400
 through North Sea oil platforms.

465
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,800
 And essentially, they're just scissors.

466
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,700
 - Wow. - They're just--

467
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,500
 - That is cool. - Scissors technology.

468
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:41,400
 The biggest one ever is the Rush triple 34 to 25 excavator

469
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,800
 with a Genesis 2500 demolition shear fitted.

470
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,100
 - Wow. - Whatever that means.

471
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,200
 But yeah, because if you have to decommission an oil rig,

472
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:55,800
 it's quite hard to carry it all the way to the recycling.

473
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,600
 You can't just put it in like your green bin.

474
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,000
 - That gets projected anyway, doesn't it?

475
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,200
 The house will sit in the back.

476
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,200
 - You need to cut it into smaller bits to get rid of it.

477
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,600
 And so they use these massive demolition shears.

478
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,200
 - That is very cool.

479
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,200
 - Temple begotas, I just think are so cool

480
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,400
 because they don't fall over.

481
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,300
 This is the weird thing, right?

482
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,300
 Japan prone to earthquakes.

483
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,600
 - Very prone to earthquakes, yeah.

484
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,400
 And lots of them, I mean, they're made of wood, right?

485
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,900
 Lots of them have burned down, sure.

486
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,800
 - If there was any big, bad wolves around.

487
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,100
 - Oh, maybe they'd be first to go.

488
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,100
 - Well, they'd be second to go after the strollers.

489
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,600
 - But they don't, basically only two have fallen over

490
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,100
 in earthquakes in about 1400 years.

491
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:34,900
 - That's amazing.

492
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,500
 This is due to the engineering.

493
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,500
 - Yes, and I just, I love this so much, right?

494
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,500
 So you can picture the shape of a pagoda, right?

495
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,200
 You've got several floors, maybe,

496
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,200
 and it's got these great big swishing eaves, right?

497
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,600
 - Like ski jumps.

498
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,700
 - Like ski jumps, exactly.

499
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,800
 And they have the eaves because it's very rainy.

500
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,800
 The rain rushes outwards down these swishy roofs and out,

501
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,000
 and the eaves are big.

502
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,900
 So the rain eventually lands on the ground further out.

503
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,000
 Yeah, when it's come on.

504
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,800
 And that means the rain doesn't go into the foundations.

505
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,100
 It doesn't cause subsidence.

506
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:05,900
 - Great.

507
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:09,400
 - And the central pillar is called the shin basheera,

508
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,100
 and it is frequently not actually rooted in the ground.

509
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,400
 It's not a foundation.

510
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,900
 It either is on the ground,

511
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,100
 or it's actually sometimes just hanging above the ground, okay?

512
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,700
 And this, I just love this so much, right?

513
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,900
 So the floors are stacked on top of each other.

514
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,900
 They're not properly attached to each other.

515
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,700
 - Right.

516
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,900
 - So the weight of them is holding them in place?

517
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,700
 - Kind of, yeah.

518
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,000
 They're sort of like plugged into each other a bit,

519
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,400
 but not like nailed together, if you see what I mean.

520
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,500
 So basically, if the structure is swaying,

521
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,500
 that massive central pillar,

522
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,600
 it acts like a tight row walker's pole,

523
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,400
 and the sliding floors all collide with that central column.

524
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,700
 So the whole thing is like a mass damping system

525
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,900
 that you get in modern skyscrapers.

526
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,500
 - Wow.

527
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,100
 - And the central pillar will drag its base

528
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,600
 along the ground a bit,

529
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,800
 which means the energy gets kind of dissipated.

530
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,000
 It's just so clever.

531
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,300
 And it's been worked out 1400 years ago.

532
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,300
 - Yeah, that's amazing.

533
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,600
 - Well, the one that I'm talking about,

534
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,300
 the very specific one in Daigoji Temple,

535
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,200
 the pagoda they have there, the five-floor one,

536
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,200
 that's the oldest pagoda in Kyoto.

537
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,100
 So that's from the 1400s.

538
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,100
 It's mad, just sitting there, unaffected.

539
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:13,700
 - Yeah.

540
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,500
 - Do you think they knew it, or was it just lucky?

541
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,000
 - Lucky.

542
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 - Yeah.

543
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,100
 It was actually just like everyone was like,

544
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,200
 "Why have you built these wobbly temples?

545
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,700
 Couldn't find any nails."

546
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,400
 I think we discussed a few years ago

547
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,200
 that they were trying to remove the smell from kimchi

548
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,600
 to make it more appealing globally.

549
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,100
 And they were worried that everyone was going to hate it

550
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:30,700
 because of the smell.

551
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,400
 But I'm not sure everyone has.

552
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,100
 It seems like they're just paranoid

553
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,300
 that this thing that they love,

554
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,700
 everyone's going to be repulsed by.

555
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,100
 And actually, as soon as they did release it to the world,

556
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,900
 everyone absolutely loved it, didn't they?

557
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,500
 - Yeah.

558
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,100
 - When they were doing the campaign,

559
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,600
 did they call it soul food?

560
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,300
 And if not, why not?

561
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,300
 - Oh, soul as in the capital of South Korea.

562
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:49,800
 - That's right.

563
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,900
 - Well, and I think, and also soul,

564
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,200
 like, you know, you say soul food.

565
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,400
 - Oh, it works in two different levels, that.

566
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:55,800
 - It does.

567
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,700
 I don't know if Andy realized that.

568
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,800
 - No, he probably didn't.

569
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,700
 No, I had no idea.

570
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,600
 I'm so grateful to you both.

571
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,700
 I was thinking bottom of the feet

572
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,800
 because it's the Olympics.

573
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,500
 - Well, I was thinking of the fish

574
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,200
 because there's fish paste in the kimchi.

575
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,900
 - Yeah.

576
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:16,000
 Okay, so we've established it works on multiple levels.

577
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,200
 - What if we covered the entire Sahara with solar panels?

578
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,200
 - It's delivery for the camels.

579
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,300
 - It would give us enough energy to power the entire world.

580
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,100
 - Wow.

581
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,600
 But surely more than.

582
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,800
 - Yeah, should we do that?

583
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,300
 - Okay.

584
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,400
 What, I feel like you wanted to say yes.

585
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,700
 - You can't just ask, like, what do you think?

586
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,400
 Does it sound like a good idea?

587
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,600
 - It would generate a massive exit

588
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,500
 because I think at the moment it's only half the size of whales

589
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,700
 which is the world's total solar power capacity.

590
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,200
 - I gotta say those Welsh farmers

591
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,800
 were not very happy when we did that.

592
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,700
 - Are you saying we shouldn't do it?

593
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,900
 - No, probably not.

594
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,300
 Like, basically it's terraforming, isn't it?

595
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,600
 It's, if you do something huge like that,

596
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,700
 it's going to affect lots of things

597
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,300
 that you can't even work out what they are.

598
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,400
 But one of them would be,

599
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,100
 they would reflect a lot of heat

600
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,200
 as well as creating electricity,

601
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:09,000
 making the temperature much warmer in the short term above them,

602
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,500
 which there would be a differential between the water

603
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,400
 and the area of the Sahara

604
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,300
 which would suck in a lot of the water as rain

605
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,800
 and suddenly the Sahara would get much greener.

606
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,400
 - Right.

607
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,400
 - Way more planting.

608
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,800
 We'd be able to farm the Sahara,

609
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,300
 in fact, probably the bits that didn't have solar power.

610
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,500
 Sounds like upsides to me.

611
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,400
 - Tick.

612
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,400
 - Well, unfortunately at the moment

613
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,000
 the dust from the Sahara feeds the Amazon rainforest

614
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,500
 because it blows over the oceans.

615
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:39,200
 So probably the Amazon rainforest would disappear

616
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,400
 and then that would cause massive amounts of decreased rainfall

617
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,700
 in crucial areas of the United States

618
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,700
 and would probably turn the entirety

619
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,000
 of the United States into a desert.

620
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,300
 So you basically just taken the desert from one place

621
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,900
 and moved it to another part of the world.

622
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,200
 - All right, big oil.

623
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,700
 And that's why we shouldn't do solar.

624
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,200
 - Well, there was actually another Duke

625
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,400
 who also was not averse to trains and tunnels, in fact,

626
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,600
 who I can't believe we haven't mentioned him.

627
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,700
 He's so amazing.

628
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,600
 William Bentick, who was the fifth Duke of Portland.

629
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,900
 So this was in around the 1850s.

630
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:21,100
 He was incredibly shy/reclusive/hated people

631
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,300
 and he built this world underground.

632
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,800
 So he is his landed seat with the Nottinghamshire

633
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,300
 and he built all these subterranean incredible rooms

634
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,900
 like this massive ballroom even though he hated people.

635
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,900
 So he never invited anyone to it.

636
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,900
 I think he used to roll a skate around it on his own.

637
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,500
 He built, you know, a big billiard room

638
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,100
 that fitted 12 billiards tables

639
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,100
 and he had 15 miles of tunnels connecting them all.

640
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,200
 Again, who's playing billiards?

641
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,000
 He doesn't allow anyone to see him.

642
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,700
 And yeah, he was near to works up railway station

643
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,300
 where sometimes he'd have to get the train to London.

644
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,400
 He doesn't want anyone to see him.

645
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,600
 So he built one of his tunnels, which was a mile or so long

646
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,100
 from his house to the railway station.

647
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,200
 Then he'd have his carriage with all the drapes down

648
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,400
 so no one could see him lifted onto the train

649
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,600
 and then he can get to London with no one seeing him.

650
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,100
 I just, I find it amazing that this world existed

651
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,000
 fully underground built by one person.

652
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,600
 Is it open to the public now?

653
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,800
 I was trying to find out if you can visit

654
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,700
 and I don't know, I don't think so.

655
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,800
 Can't be safe.

656
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,600
 Maybe it's safe, could be.

657
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,200
 Mr. Badger in "Wind of the Willows"

658
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,800
 or Badger was based on him.

659
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,300
 Is it not based on the fact that Badger's dig tunnels?

660
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:31,600
 No, weirdly Kenneth Graham didn't know that at the time.

661
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,500
 It's a total coincidence.

662
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,800
 I found the dullest fact I found in some years

663
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,400
 which is also about spiders and guitars.

664
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,100
 Okay.

665
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,600
 It's a high bar.

666
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,900
 BBC News, September 2012, right?

667
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,100
 The backstage area of a Jersey music festival

668
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,100
 had to be quarantined

669
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,200
 after a large spider jumped out of Noel Gallagher's flight case.

670
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:54,800
 Jersey live crew were unpacking his guitars on Sunday

671
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,300
 when they saw the huge black spider with green fangs.

672
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:00,000
 It was taken away to be checked by a herpetologist

673
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,100
 who I know does snakes.

674
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,200
 What?

675
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,600
 He's like, "Mrs. Nightingale is a snake nor a lizard."

676
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,500
 I think there was no a ragnology at that stage at Jersey Live.

677
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,300
 It's like, "Is there a dunce around bars?"

678
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,800
 "Well, I'm a dentist."

679
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,800
 It's exactly the same.

680
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:21,600
 All right, that is it.

681
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,100
 That is all of our outtakes.

682
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,400
 Thank you so much for listening.

683
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,100
 If you've got any questions, any comments, any opinions

684
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,900
 you want to add to the things that were said

685
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,700
 during the course of this compilation,

686
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,800
 podcast@ky.com, send us an email there.

687
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,400
 And you never know, that email might end up being read out

688
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,400
 on one of our Drop Us a Line episodes

689
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,700
 that you get as part of a club fish membership

690
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,700
 and we can talk about it on there.

691
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,300
 So that's it for now.

692
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,200
 As I said at the top, we are on tour.

693
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,600
 If you want to come and say hi,

694
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,400
 head to knowsuchthingasafish.com.

695
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,500
 All of the links are up there for all the cities and towns

696
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,500
 we're heading to.

697
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,500
 And yeah, we'd love to see you all there.

698
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,800
 Thundernerds, it's going to be an amazing show.

699
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,800
 That's it for now.

700
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,800
 We'll be back in a couple of weeks with more bonus content
