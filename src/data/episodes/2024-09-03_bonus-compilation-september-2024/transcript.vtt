WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800
 Hey Clubfish members, Dan here and welcome to your secret bonus content that you get as part of your membership.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:12.000
 Today we have a compilation episode for you, so these are all the bits that just didn't quite fit into the episodes,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.600
 the tangents that we would go on that don't quite fit the shape of the show, but they're all great bits,

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.400
 and so we bung 'em all together here for you to listen to.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.100
 So I hope you enjoy it, I hope that we get to meet some of you Clubfishers out on the road.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.100
 Our tour is beginning properly as of this Friday.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.600
 We are going to be in Bristol with our Thunder Nerds tour, and then we're going over to Dublin the next week,

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.000
 and then there's more UK dates.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 If you want to come and see us live, no such thing as TheFish.com.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.300
 You can find links to all the tickets there, so go check that out.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.800
 We've been road testing some material for the whole show as the extra bits that you get as the live audience,

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.300
 and it's so fun.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.700
 There's going to be quizzes, audience interaction, we've got special guests, it's going to be awesome.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:59.300
 So do come along if you can, check out the list of where we're going and get your ticket.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.500
 Alright, well let's get on with this week's compilation.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.100
 You are going to be hearing about Space Monks,

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.400
 you're going to be hearing about Japanese scissors known as knob cutters,

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.600
 and you're going to be hearing about insanely long-lasting pagodas.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.100
 Let's do it, on with the show!

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:28.500
 [Music]

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:36.300
 I've got a couple of things just to do with other efforts of combining monks and space together as a thing.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.400
 There is a lot of research that's currently going on by scientists who are trying to work out

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.100
 how can we get to places like Mars when you've got a human body that might go into,

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.700
 you know, they're trying to work out can we put you into hibernation, all that sort of stuff for deep space travel.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.100
 And a lot of them are looking into monks and how they can take their bodies to extreme places,

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.200
 how they can lower their heart rates to basically a hibernating state and so on.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.200
 And the Dalai Lama has loaned out hundreds of monks to science communities in Russia

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.500
 who are currently studying them to see if they can get astronauts to emulate this kind of hibernation.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.900
 Did they consent to that? I don't know if I'd agree to be loaned out to a Russian science community.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.400
 Yeah, you go where your Lama sends you.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.300
 Yeah, so that's an effort that's going on right now

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.600
 because they can take the body to places that are quite remarkable with meditation as we've talked about before.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.800
 Do you have to stay meditating for the whole, what is it, year-long journey to Mars?

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.700
 That feels like extreme, that feels very difficult to me.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.900
 Yeah, definitely, right? I'm very distractible.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.800
 I think it's only a few months to Mars.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.100
 Really? I think so.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.200
 I don't think it's a year, yeah.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.600
 So you get that Buzz Aldrin cycle thing there.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.900
 Yeah, all right.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.300
 But I would still be tempted to look at my phone halfway through.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.100
 I would.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.900
 Where are you going to get a signal halfway between,

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.500
 "Oh, we're at a Lagrange point. Hold your phone up in the air."

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.800
 Exactly, yeah.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.800
 If it's in front of me, I will just be looking at it, you know.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.100
 But that monks probably don't keep their phones in front of them.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.200
 That's probably another element of being a monk.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.600
 So they aren't doing a thing where they're trying to work out

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.200
 if they can sort of, as through drug induction,

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.300
 whether they can drug induce a torpor,

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.400
 which is a type of hibernation, right?

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.800
 So the idea is that the astronauts going to Mars

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.700
 would have to really stock up on food,

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.900
 put on a lot of weight, which they could shed over that period.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.800
 Yeah, exactly.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.500
 Dude, like Grizzly Bear, for instance, when they go into topper,

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.200
 they put a plug in their anuses

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.600
 so that they don't defecate like of hair and mud and stuff like that.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.100
 Do you think the astronauts might do that?

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.300
 I think if they did, they might not tell us.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.200
 That'll be it.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.300
 The bears put it there.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.100
 I always thought it just kind of built up.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.300
 The bears don't shove anything.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.400
 I thought it sort of appeared as well,

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.100
 the tap-tap it, whatever it's called.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.500
 They're just shoving the mud.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.700
 But I've never thought about it.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.500
 Rebecca, reach with this.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.500
 Oh, what, this plug?

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.000
 No, it just imponds itself.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.900
 I'll use that excuse.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.100
 In 2000, and I had not realized,

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.500
 I had forgotten one of the causes of that.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.400
 A brilliantly successful election in America,

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.700
 which I'm sure everyone remembers,

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.600
 was the butterfly ballots,

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.500
 which was, I don't know if you've seen these,

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.800
 but it's in Florida,

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.000
 where obviously it was where they had to have a massive recap

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.900
 between Gore and Burton.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.000
 It's always been very controversial.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.900
 Exactly.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.700
 In Florida, they had butterfly ballots,

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.000
 and if you look at them,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.800
 they're completely misaligned.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.500
 So if you voted for one candidate,

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.700
 if you read a candidate's name,

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.500
 and in this case, it was actually if you read the Democrat's name,

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.300
 so if you followed Gore's name along,

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.400
 and you ticked the first box that you came to,

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.800
 that was actually a vote for Pappy Cannon,

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.400
 because they misaligned the boxes by the names.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.500
 Oh, you had one job.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.600
 Oh, no.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.600
 I mean, how much of it

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.400
 surely goes into the most important Democratic moment

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.700
 in every four years?

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.000
 And they fucked it up,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.700
 and they calculated that about 2,000 people

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.100
 must have made that mistake,

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.500
 and that was more than the majority that Bush got.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.200
 So, but how does that happen?

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.500
 How does no one look at that and go, guys?

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.300
 Is this legit?

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.500
 That's crazy.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.300
 In America, I actually hadn't realized

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.900
 how long electronic voting has been around.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.100
 It's extraordinary, since it's the 19th century.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.200
 We are behind the curve in Britain compared to those guys,

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.600
 and they're so beautiful,

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.900
 the really old voting machine.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.200
 So the first one was kind of invented

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.600
 in the very late 19th century,

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.800
 and it's lever-operated,

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.100
 and you can look up pictures,

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.400
 but basically, it was calculated at the time

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.900
 that it had more moving parts than any other machine

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.500
 in the country, like more than cars at the time.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.700
 And it was the most complicated machine there was.

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.400
 And so there'll be lots of candidates here

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.700
 at this big metal machine

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.400
 that looks like a really old arcade game or something.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.400
 And each candidate has a mini lever next to their name,

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.700
 or if you know that you're just going to vote

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.900
 along party lines on everything,

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.300
 then you've got a big lever,

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.600
 which is Democrat or a big lever,

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.700
 which is Republican.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.300
 You can just pull them.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.300
 And then behind the scenes,

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.800
 it's got to be incredibly complicated,

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.100
 because all the mini levers

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.700
 have to connect to the relevant major lever.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.700
 And also, your vote isn't registered

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.800
 until you pull the final lever,

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.100
 which opens the curtain,

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.700
 which has been around you for privacy,

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.200
 to escape, and it's when you pull the curtain.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.100
 - So we're looking for a four-digit number.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.200
 Like, I've got a lot of color here.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.800
 I've got four colors.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.100
 Come on, guys, we can work this out.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.200
 - The ceiling is slowly sinking towards me.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.300
 - Sounds chaotic.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.700
 - You know what I wonder about that?

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:26.900
 You know how does this thing,

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.300
 that if your name is closer to the top of the ballot,

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.300
 that people vote for you,

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.400
 or more likely to vote for you?

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.000
 - Okay.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.700
 - I wonder if you've got two levers.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:34.600
 - Oh, yeah.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.800
 - Were the right-handed people

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.200
 are more likely to pull the right one?

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.000
 - Definitely not.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.700
 - Definitely not.

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:39.500
 - Well, unfortunately,

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.000
 it's usually a mix-up with the makeup machine.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.400
 The Democrat lever actually votes you Republican.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.100
 - But no, I bet that would be the case.

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:47.800
 - It feels like it.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.500
 - I bet so.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.600
 - If I'm right-handed,

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.200
 and I'm pulling the left lever,

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.900
 I'm way more likely to half pull it,

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.000
 and then my hands slip off,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.500
 and not pull the left lever.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.100
 - And then it spoils your ballot.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.000
 That sounds like a terrible system.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.700
 As in the little pencil genuinely does,

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:02.800
 it works very, very well.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.500
 - Or a permanent ink in my case

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.200
 so that people don't rub out my votes,

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.300
 because I know that happens.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:08.800
 - The last thing I voted at,

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.400
 the lady in front of me,

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.100
 got told, "Yeah, there's your booth.

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:13.000
 There's a pencil in the booth."

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.200
 And she said, "Can I borrow your pen?"

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.200
 And I said, "Yeah."

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.800
 And she said, "Good. Can't rub out pen."

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.900
 And she was one of the truthers.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.800
 - I remember when I was at primary school,

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.300
 you used to buy robbers that could rub out ink.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.600
 - Well, exactly.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.000
 That is the worst conspiracy theory of modern times,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.600
 is that why wouldn't you just print more ballot papers

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.500
 and fill them out?

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.300
 Why would you have a team,

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.300
 a secret team of children with robbers

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.300
 in a backroom somewhere,

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.200
 rubbing out people's votes?

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.600
 Anyway, never mind that.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.000
 - And then she went on to vote Lydden.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.200
 - Do you think there's anything, as you were saying,

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.800
 with a name being higher on the ballot and so on?

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.200
 Is there any research, I wonder,

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.000
 about names being familiar names to people that you know?

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.700
 So for example, I felt quite warm to Sean Kemp

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:53.900
 that you mentioned just now

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.800
 because he's one of the greatest basketball players

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.700
 of all time.

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:59.700
 And name association often is a thing, isn't it?

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:02.500
 - Wait, not the former Lydden press head of press.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:03.500
 We all remember his name.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.200
 - He's one of the best basketball players of all time.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.400
 - Namesake. They show names.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.100
 - I see. I see. Okay.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.100
 - We don't know.

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:11.700
 We're the same person.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.000
 - We do. That's true.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:14.800
 - That's interesting.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.100
 I think, like, I remember in the Ukrainian election,

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.600
 the last one that Ukraine had,

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.800
 they had a lot of candidates

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.400
 who had very, very similar names, didn't they?

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:23.900
 Do you remember that?

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:25.900
 - They named themselves Zelensky, didn't they?

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.300
 - I think they'd be Zelensky with two Ys.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.200
 All of them would be Zelensky with an E and an E.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.500
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:34.300
 I think that's definitely true, Dan.

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:37.200
 If I see a name of someone I admire,

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.900
 I'll be lucky to think one of them.

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:41.500
 - Yeah.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.800
 - If I saw a Dan or James or an Anna in the polling booth.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.500
 - Don't need to say which way you think.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.100
 - I had no idea that hunters have to wear high vis.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:53.900
 - Yeah, it's to stop them from shooting each other.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:54.800
 - Well, that makes sense.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.700
 But I just thought, I just, I think of a hunter.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:00.100
 I think of someone who I haven't seen at all, actually.

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:01.100
 Do you know who he is?

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:01.800
 - He's a camouflage.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:02.800
 - You think of a tree.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.700
 You look at every tree and you think, could be a hunter.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:05.900
 - Could be absolutely stuffed with hunters.

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:06.700
 And I know it's not.

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.900
 So I'm able to go camping with a bit more reassurance.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:09.400
 - I think so.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.200
 These are like sport hunters, I suppose.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.200
 So they're not like, they are trying to get the animals,

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.300
 but they're more...

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:15.700
 - I see.

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.800
 But if they're a trained government assassins after me,

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.900
 they may not necessarily be bound by the same rules.

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:20.500
 - Exactly.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:21.600
 - Okay, okay, okay, okay.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:21.900
 I get that.

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.500
 - But I think it's unlikely.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.500
 Although actually probably in, you know,

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:26.800
 parts of London where we live,

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:30.100
 someone in a high vis jacket would blend in,

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:34.200
 especially with the potholes that they have to continuously mend

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.800
 and the road works always in North London.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.500
 - I'll tell you what, actually.

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.300
 Tell you what, the election going on,

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:41.900
 all these politicians going around high vis.

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:43.700
 Probably, you know, you see someone in high vis.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:44.600
 You think it's a builder.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:48.100
 It's probably a candidate for an office, you know,

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.100
 trying to pretend to be a working man, you know.

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:50.800
 - Damn, you're good at that.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.100
 (all laughing)

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:54.300
 - Keep digging.

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.600
 Keep drilling.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.000
 - Do you think this is creepy, by the way?

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.900
 Sorry, this is all going back to the last section,

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.100
 but speaking of candidates going around knocking on doors.

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:05.000
 You know, people have got smart doorbells now.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:05.400
 - Yeah.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.300
 - And politicians are saying it's quite useful

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.200
 because you can speak to someone

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.200
 even when they're not in the country.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.500
 So you ring their doorbell and I think a Lib Dem candidate

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:14.900
 said someone answered from a sunbed in Spain.

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:17.300
 And then said another person answered from their bath.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:18.300
 And they had a nice chat with them

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:19.000
 about who they were going to vote for.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.200
 - All right, you know, going to Spain,

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.200
 but probably thanks to Brexit,

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.600
 not hardly anyone's in Spain these days.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.300
 - There we go, there we go.

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:28.500
 And you brought it home.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.800
 (all laughing)

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.800
 - I'm going to be to set James up like that.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:38.300
 - We've hit that oil, but I knew it was down there somewhere.

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:40.600
 - But yeah, you did get cats in Egypt, of course.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.600
 - Indeed.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.700
 - The mother of all cats was Bastet.

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:47.600
 And in theory, all cats have a little bit of her in them.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.600
 - Today, is she a kind of cat god all the time?

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.100
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:51.500
 - She's like the Genghis kind of cats.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.700
 - Exactly, all cats are little Bastets.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.300
 (all laughing)

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:57.900
 - Was she a real historical cat?

00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:59.900
 Or is she in mythology?

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.500
 - She's the goddess of, you know,

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.000
 with the cat face and the human body.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:04.900
 - Got it.

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:06.400
 - That's cool.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.700
 - They have a quite an interesting role in Hebrew

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.700
 and Islamic texts as well,

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:15.100
 which is that they didn't exist until the Ark.

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:19.200
 So they were created on the Ark.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.000
 - Really?

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.800
 - So this is not according to Christian beliefs,

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:26.800
 but yeah, Hebrew and Islam believe that we're on the Ark.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.000
 They've got a mouse problem.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.200
 Some of the old texts say that the mouse was created

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:34.000
 because a pig sneezed and it came out of the pig's nose.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.300
 Anyway, there's a mouse problem on the Ark.

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:38.700
 Everyone's like, Noah, what are we going to do about this mouse?

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:42.400
 And Noah rubbed his hand over the lion's head a few times

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.700
 and the lion sneezed out some cats.

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:45.600
 - What text is this?

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.200
 Is this Hebrew and Islamic?

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.800
 - Ancient Hebrew and Islamic texts.

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.200
 - So it's not in the Old Testament,

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.200
 but it's in the versions of the Old Testament.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.000
 - Exactly, it's in other bits of scripture.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.700
 - And it's quite the story.

00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:59.700
 - I was really trying to find the very original source

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:01.300
 that they did back to, but it is like, yeah,

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:02.500
 going back to like six.

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:03.900
 - Well, there's a cuneiform, isn't there?

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:05.200
 That what's his name found?

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.100
 - Irving Finkel.

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.800
 - Irving Finkel, which is the earliest text about the Ark.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.000
 - Maybe that's a little picture on it

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.600
 of a lion sneezing out a kissin.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.300
 - They're such a mad sort of robes

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:16.300
 and otherwise very credible.

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:17.800
 - Right, yeah, of course.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.600
 - When they were putting together the Old Testament,

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.600
 they must have been like, are we going to do the sneezing bit?

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.200
 No, Noah's going to believe that.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.900
 - Actually, Muhammad loved cats.

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:28.500
 There's another story which I really like

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.900
 where he had to go to pray and had to put his prayer cloak on

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:34.100
 and he saw a cat was sleeping on it.

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.500
 So rather than wake up the cat,

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.400
 he cut off the arm of his cloak

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.700
 and took it away without waking the cat.

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:40.700
 - That's clever.

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:42.700
 - And also very much a symbol of sort of cats' relationships

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:43.500
 with humans.

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.300
 - Yeah, what, just sort of do what they say?

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:47.700
 - Yeah, they'll do what they want.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:48.800
 - Yeah, they do what they want.

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.300
 We work around them.

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:52.900
 Do you know the most expensive pair of knob cutters?

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:54.700
 - Oh, no. - Oh, bonsai scissors.

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:56.500
 - No. - I think this is the most expensive.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.500
 They're made by Yasuhiro Hirakawa,

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:01.700
 who is a fifth generation bonsai scissor maker.

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:06.500
 And he has one pair that go for $35,000,

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:09.100
 but usually sells them for about $1,100.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.000
 And it's one of those--

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.300
 - Is it one of those tourist things?

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:15.500
 Like I spent so much money on like novelty chopsticks

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:16.400
 when I went to Japan.

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:17.200
 - Yeah, probably.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.500
 And then for normal Japanese people,

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.500
 they're just on sale in Asda.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:23.100
 No, it's great 'cause it's so typical Japanese

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:24.700
 where they take so much care

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:27.200
 and go to such extreme lengths.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:30.500
 So there's a bonsai craftsman called Masakazu Yoshikawa

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:31.600
 who I watched an interview with.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:35.300
 And he gets his scissors bespoke made by this scissor maker.

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:37.100
 And he says, he'll get on the phone, Tim,

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.700
 spend an hour explaining exactly what he wants to do.

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:41.500
 You know, the kind of tree, exactly the thing.

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.600
 - That's a boring hour for Mr.--

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:44.900
 Did you say Hirakawa?

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.800
 - Describe exactly the kind of knob he wants to cut.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.700
 - Hirakawa's taking notes.

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:52.700
 - Yeah, okay, so it's a knob on the tree, isn't it?

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:53.900
 Yeah.

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:55.700
 Okay.

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:56.900
 Yeah.

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:59.700
 - But you don't get one hour later, right?

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:02.100
 - No, I do, yeah, I have actually done this before, yeah.

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:03.800
 (laughing)

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.500
 - Well, he's actually--

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.800
 - I'm gonna charge you $30,000 for these.

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:11.000
 We normally sell them at a 98% discount to all our customers.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.700
 - He's not the one you should feel sorry for.

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:17.500
 'Cause then Parod Masakazu has to wait up to a year.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:18.600
 - Who's that, sorry?

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.600
 - The person who's ordered the scissors.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.800
 Then he says, you know, then Hirakawa will say,

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.300
 well, I need to research that.

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:25.600
 There'll be a lot of information there.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.100
 It'll take six months to a year.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:29.900
 - It is hard to research knobs on the internet.

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:32.300
 (laughing)

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:35.000
 He has to scroll through lots of pages of Google

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.900
 before he finds out these three knobs.

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:39.800
 - Developed a massive porn addiction.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:42.200
 (laughing)

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.900
 - Yep, spends 11 months looking at porn

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:45.700
 and then a month making some scissors.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.200
 - You know those lances that you get

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:48.900
 when someone's unveiling something?

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:50.300
 - Oh yeah, the novelty.

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:53.000
 - They don't look very sharp, though.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.200
 - I don't think they are.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.100
 I think, I don't know.

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:56.500
 - Oh, they're sharp enough for a ribbon.

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:57.340
 - There's some, there's some--

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:58.600
 - Winners really aren't that hard.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.300
 - They can't do, they can't do microsurgery

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:01.140
 or anything like that.

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:01.960
 But why would you want them to?

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:03.500
 But they normally, they're--

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.700
 - Your doctor brought those out during microsurgery.

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:06.700
 (laughing)

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:08.300
 - They're just going, "This is--"

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:10.100
 - Yeah, the last thing you see is you're doing the couch

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:11.100
 for the anesthesia.

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:14.800
 - But normally you hire them.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.100
 I guess because why on earth

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:18.200
 would you want to keep a two foot long pair of scissors.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.200
 It's just, but there is--

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.100
 - There can't be many in the country.

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:23.000
 There aren't many in the country, James, I'm so glad.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.500
 So there's, in the UK,

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.300
 there's unveilingcurtains.co.uk.

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:29.300
 They say no unveiling ceremony is complete

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:32.000
 without a pair of our giant ceremony ribbon scissors.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.500
 But in America, there's goldenopenings.com.

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:35.900
 - Oh, I saw their website, really great.

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:38.500
 - Yeah, and what were you Googling when you found that?

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:39.900
 (laughing)

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:42.200
 - Well, I'd finished Googling, obviously, though.

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.600
 - But they are 40 inches long.

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:45.700
 They advertise themselves

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:48.900
 as the largest working scissors in the world.

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:51.800
 And they, you can hire those for $75,

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.100
 which is pretty good.

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:55.200
 - You can also hire a stand.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.700
 - No, that's the thing, they sell you the stand.

00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:59.400
 - What, you can't hire the stand?

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.700
 - I believe not.

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:01.800
 - Oh my gosh. - 'Cause you display stand,

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.100
 which you have to buy,

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:05.400
 and then you hire the scissors for $75.

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.100
 - What else can you use a display stand for

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.600
 after you've had to give the scissors back?

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:09.900
 - Nothing.

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:11.500
 - I've got some bigger scissors than that.

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:14.700
 - Have you? - Yeah, demolition shears.

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:16.200
 - Cool.

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.800
 - Get a corner building in there.

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.600
 - Pretty much, yeah. - What?

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:24.000
 - With 34 meters in length. - What?

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.200
 - Attached to a massive excavator arm.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.600
 These are used for cutting their way

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.400
 through North Sea oil platforms.

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.800
 And essentially, they're just scissors.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:34.700
 - Wow. - They're just--

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:36.500
 - That is cool. - Scissors technology.

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:41.400
 The biggest one ever is the Rush triple 34 to 25 excavator

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:44.800
 with a Genesis 2500 demolition shear fitted.

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:47.100
 - Wow. - Whatever that means.

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:51.200
 But yeah, because if you have to decommission an oil rig,

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:55.800
 it's quite hard to carry it all the way to the recycling.

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:59.600
 You can't just put it in like your green bin.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:01.000
 - That gets projected anyway, doesn't it?

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.200
 The house will sit in the back.

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:05.200
 - You need to cut it into smaller bits to get rid of it.

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.600
 And so they use these massive demolition shears.

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:10.200
 - That is very cool.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.200
 - Temple begotas, I just think are so cool

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:13.400
 because they don't fall over.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.300
 This is the weird thing, right?

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.300
 Japan prone to earthquakes.

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:18.600
 - Very prone to earthquakes, yeah.

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:21.400
 And lots of them, I mean, they're made of wood, right?

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:22.900
 Lots of them have burned down, sure.

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:24.800
 - If there was any big, bad wolves around.

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:27.100
 - Oh, maybe they'd be first to go.

00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:30.100
 - Well, they'd be second to go after the strollers.

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:32.600
 - But they don't, basically only two have fallen over

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.100
 in earthquakes in about 1400 years.

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:34.900
 - That's amazing.

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.500
 This is due to the engineering.

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:38.500
 - Yes, and I just, I love this so much, right?

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.500
 So you can picture the shape of a pagoda, right?

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.200
 You've got several floors, maybe,

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:45.200
 and it's got these great big swishing eaves, right?

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.600
 - Like ski jumps.

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.700
 - Like ski jumps, exactly.

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:51.800
 And they have the eaves because it's very rainy.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:55.800
 The rain rushes outwards down these swishy roofs and out,

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:57.000
 and the eaves are big.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.900
 So the rain eventually lands on the ground further out.

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:01.000
 Yeah, when it's come on.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.800
 And that means the rain doesn't go into the foundations.

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.100
 It doesn't cause subsidence.

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:05.900
 - Great.

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:09.400
 - And the central pillar is called the shin basheera,

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:13.100
 and it is frequently not actually rooted in the ground.

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:14.400
 It's not a foundation.

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.900
 It either is on the ground,

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:20.100
 or it's actually sometimes just hanging above the ground, okay?

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:21.700
 And this, I just love this so much, right?

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:23.900
 So the floors are stacked on top of each other.

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:25.900
 They're not properly attached to each other.

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:26.700
 - Right.

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:28.900
 - So the weight of them is holding them in place?

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:29.700
 - Kind of, yeah.

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:32.000
 They're sort of like plugged into each other a bit,

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.400
 but not like nailed together, if you see what I mean.

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:36.500
 So basically, if the structure is swaying,

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.500
 that massive central pillar,

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:40.600
 it acts like a tight row walker's pole,

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:43.400
 and the sliding floors all collide with that central column.

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.700
 So the whole thing is like a mass damping system

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:46.900
 that you get in modern skyscrapers.

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:47.500
 - Wow.

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:49.100
 - And the central pillar will drag its base

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:50.600
 along the ground a bit,

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.800
 which means the energy gets kind of dissipated.

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.000
 It's just so clever.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.300
 And it's been worked out 1400 years ago.

00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:58.300
 - Yeah, that's amazing.

00:18:58.300 --> 00:18:59.600
 - Well, the one that I'm talking about,

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:02.300
 the very specific one in Daigoji Temple,

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:04.200
 the pagoda they have there, the five-floor one,

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:07.200
 that's the oldest pagoda in Kyoto.

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:10.100
 So that's from the 1400s.

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:13.100
 It's mad, just sitting there, unaffected.

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:13.700
 - Yeah.

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:15.500
 - Do you think they knew it, or was it just lucky?

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:16.000
 - Lucky.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 - Yeah.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.100
 It was actually just like everyone was like,

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:20.200
 "Why have you built these wobbly temples?

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.700
 Couldn't find any nails."

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:24.400
 I think we discussed a few years ago

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.200
 that they were trying to remove the smell from kimchi

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.600
 to make it more appealing globally.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:30.100
 And they were worried that everyone was going to hate it

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:30.700
 because of the smell.

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:32.400
 But I'm not sure everyone has.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.100
 It seems like they're just paranoid

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:35.300
 that this thing that they love,

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:36.700
 everyone's going to be repulsed by.

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:39.100
 And actually, as soon as they did release it to the world,

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:40.900
 everyone absolutely loved it, didn't they?

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:41.500
 - Yeah.

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:43.100
 - When they were doing the campaign,

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:45.600
 did they call it soul food?

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.300
 And if not, why not?

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:49.300
 - Oh, soul as in the capital of South Korea.

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:49.800
 - That's right.

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:51.900
 - Well, and I think, and also soul,

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.200
 like, you know, you say soul food.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.400
 - Oh, it works in two different levels, that.

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:55.800
 - It does.

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:56.700
 I don't know if Andy realized that.

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:57.800
 - No, he probably didn't.

00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.700
 No, I had no idea.

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:01.600
 I'm so grateful to you both.

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.700
 I was thinking bottom of the feet

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:06.800
 because it's the Olympics.

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:08.500
 - Well, I was thinking of the fish

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:11.200
 because there's fish paste in the kimchi.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:11.900
 - Yeah.

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:16.000
 Okay, so we've established it works on multiple levels.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.200
 - What if we covered the entire Sahara with solar panels?

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.200
 - It's delivery for the camels.

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:26.300
 - It would give us enough energy to power the entire world.

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:27.100
 - Wow.

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:28.600
 But surely more than.

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:30.800
 - Yeah, should we do that?

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:31.300
 - Okay.

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:33.400
 What, I feel like you wanted to say yes.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.700
 - You can't just ask, like, what do you think?

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:36.400
 Does it sound like a good idea?

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.600
 - It would generate a massive exit

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.500
 because I think at the moment it's only half the size of whales

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.700
 which is the world's total solar power capacity.

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:45.200
 - I gotta say those Welsh farmers

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.800
 were not very happy when we did that.

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:48.700
 - Are you saying we shouldn't do it?

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:49.900
 - No, probably not.

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.300
 Like, basically it's terraforming, isn't it?

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:54.600
 It's, if you do something huge like that,

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:56.700
 it's going to affect lots of things

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:58.300
 that you can't even work out what they are.

00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:00.400
 But one of them would be,

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.100
 they would reflect a lot of heat

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:04.200
 as well as creating electricity,

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:09.000
 making the temperature much warmer in the short term above them,

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.500
 which there would be a differential between the water

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:13.400
 and the area of the Sahara

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:16.300
 which would suck in a lot of the water as rain

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:18.800
 and suddenly the Sahara would get much greener.

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:19.400
 - Right.

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.400
 - Way more planting.

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:22.800
 We'd be able to farm the Sahara,

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:25.300
 in fact, probably the bits that didn't have solar power.

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:26.500
 Sounds like upsides to me.

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:27.400
 - Tick.

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.400
 - Well, unfortunately at the moment

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:33.000
 the dust from the Sahara feeds the Amazon rainforest

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.500
 because it blows over the oceans.

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:39.200
 So probably the Amazon rainforest would disappear

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:43.400
 and then that would cause massive amounts of decreased rainfall

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:45.700
 in crucial areas of the United States

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:47.700
 and would probably turn the entirety

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:50.000
 of the United States into a desert.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.300
 So you basically just taken the desert from one place

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:55.900
 and moved it to another part of the world.

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:58.200
 - All right, big oil.

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:02.700
 And that's why we shouldn't do solar.

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:04.200
 - Well, there was actually another Duke

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:08.400
 who also was not averse to trains and tunnels, in fact,

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.600
 who I can't believe we haven't mentioned him.

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:10.700
 He's so amazing.

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:13.600
 William Bentick, who was the fifth Duke of Portland.

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:16.900
 So this was in around the 1850s.

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:21.100
 He was incredibly shy/reclusive/hated people

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:24.300
 and he built this world underground.

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:26.800
 So he is his landed seat with the Nottinghamshire

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:30.300
 and he built all these subterranean incredible rooms

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:32.900
 like this massive ballroom even though he hated people.

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:34.900
 So he never invited anyone to it.

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:37.900
 I think he used to roll a skate around it on his own.

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:40.500
 He built, you know, a big billiard room

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:42.100
 that fitted 12 billiards tables

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:45.100
 and he had 15 miles of tunnels connecting them all.

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:46.200
 Again, who's playing billiards?

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:49.000
 He doesn't allow anyone to see him.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.700
 And yeah, he was near to works up railway station

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:54.300
 where sometimes he'd have to get the train to London.

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:55.400
 He doesn't want anyone to see him.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:58.600
 So he built one of his tunnels, which was a mile or so long

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:01.100
 from his house to the railway station.

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:03.200
 Then he'd have his carriage with all the drapes down

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.400
 so no one could see him lifted onto the train

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:08.600
 and then he can get to London with no one seeing him.

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:11.100
 I just, I find it amazing that this world existed

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:14.000
 fully underground built by one person.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.600
 Is it open to the public now?

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:16.800
 I was trying to find out if you can visit

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.700
 and I don't know, I don't think so.

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:19.800
 Can't be safe.

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:21.600
 Maybe it's safe, could be.

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.200
 Mr. Badger in "Wind of the Willows"

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:24.800
 or Badger was based on him.

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:28.300
 Is it not based on the fact that Badger's dig tunnels?

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:31.600
 No, weirdly Kenneth Graham didn't know that at the time.

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.500
 It's a total coincidence.

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:36.800
 I found the dullest fact I found in some years

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:38.400
 which is also about spiders and guitars.

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:39.100
 Okay.

00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:40.600
 It's a high bar.

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:43.900
 BBC News, September 2012, right?

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:46.100
 The backstage area of a Jersey music festival

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.100
 had to be quarantined

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:50.200
 after a large spider jumped out of Noel Gallagher's flight case.

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:54.800
 Jersey live crew were unpacking his guitars on Sunday

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.300
 when they saw the huge black spider with green fangs.

00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:00.000
 It was taken away to be checked by a herpetologist

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.100
 who I know does snakes.

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:02.200
 What?

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:05.600
 He's like, "Mrs. Nightingale is a snake nor a lizard."

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:09.500
 I think there was no a ragnology at that stage at Jersey Live.

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:11.300
 It's like, "Is there a dunce around bars?"

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:12.800
 "Well, I'm a dentist."

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.800
 It's exactly the same.

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:21.600
 All right, that is it.

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:23.100
 That is all of our outtakes.

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:24.400
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:27.100

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:36.400
 And you never know, that email might end up being read out

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.400
 on one of our Drop Us a Line episodes

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.700
 that you get as part of a club fish membership

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:42.700
 and we can talk about it on there.

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:44.300
 So that's it for now.

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:46.200
 As I said at the top, we are on tour.

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.600
 If you want to come and say hi,

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:49.400

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.500
 All of the links are up there for all the cities and towns

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:52.500
 we're heading to.

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:54.500
 And yeah, we'd love to see you all there.

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:56.800
 Thundernerds, it's going to be an amazing show.

00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:57.800
 That's it for now.

00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:59.800
 We'll be back in a couple of weeks with more bonus content

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:00.800
 for you club fishers.

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:01.800
 So we'll see you then.

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:02.800
 Goodbye.

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.380
 (upbeat music)

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:07.960
 (upbeat music)
