00:01:47,00:01:49,Thank you everyone for being here.
00:01:49,00:01:50,Thank you so much.
00:01:50,00:01:51,This is very exciting for us.
00:01:51,00:01:52,We love doing our live shows.
00:01:52,00:01:56,We're very proud to have been invited to the 10 year anniversary of the London Podcast
00:01:56,00:01:57,Festival.
00:01:57,00:01:59,This is something that we played quite a few times.
00:01:59,00:02:01,Do we ever play it the first year?
00:02:01,00:02:02,No.
00:02:02,00:02:03,We weren't invited.
00:02:03,00:02:04,No.
00:02:04,00:02:05,But why don't we bring out our guests?
00:02:05,00:02:06,We have a very exciting guest.
00:02:06,00:02:11,"So it's not just the 10 year anniversary of the London Podcast Festival, but on the 4th"
00:02:11,00:02:18,of October 2015 a woman called Belinda blinked for the very first time.
00:02:18,00:02:24,She blinked into existence and it gave birth to what is basically the pop culture podcast
00:02:24,00:02:29,phenomena of the UK and we're very excited to have one of the members here.
00:02:29,00:02:34,Could you please welcome onto the stage celebrating his 10 year anniversary of his own show.
00:02:34,00:02:35,His dad wrote a porno.
00:02:35,00:02:37,"Jamie Morden, everyone."
00:02:37,00:02:44,10 years.
00:02:44,00:02:47,This is the first place we ever played porno.
00:02:47,00:02:48,That's true.
00:02:48,00:02:49,"Oh, really?"
00:02:49,00:02:50,You first have a live show.
00:02:50,00:02:51,Yes.
00:02:51,00:02:52,Yeah.
00:02:52,00:02:53,"That's cool, man."
00:02:53,00:02:54,I was here for it.
00:02:54,00:02:55,"Yes, stalker."
00:02:55,00:02:56,Yeah.
00:02:56,00:02:57,Didn't know him.
00:02:57,00:02:58,Still don't really.
00:02:58,00:03:02,I was in the audience and they did a tombola thing at the end to give away a prize and they picked
00:03:02,00:03:09,out a winner and the first winner was for a row that didn't exist in the room.
00:03:09,00:03:10,So this secret.
00:03:10,00:03:11,Yeah.
00:03:11,00:03:13,Surely every theatre has a row.
00:03:13,00:03:15,It was like 0.2 or so.
00:03:15,00:03:16,That's not a row.
00:03:16,00:03:17,It was really weird.
00:03:17,00:03:22,It took ages to work out the row didn't exist and then they did it again and it was a sold-out
00:03:22,00:03:23,show.
00:03:23,00:03:25,It landed on the only seat that was empty.
00:03:25,00:03:26,So no one.
00:03:26,00:03:27,"Thanks, Dan."
00:03:27,00:03:32,"So anyway, I love you to be here, but then the third one came and it was my seat."
00:03:32,00:03:33,And I won.
00:03:33,00:03:34,Yeah.
00:03:34,00:03:37,And I came up and it looked like the whole thing was fixed and grew in the moment.
00:03:37,00:03:38,What did you win?
00:03:38,00:03:39,A mug.
00:03:39,00:03:40,A mug.
00:03:40,00:03:41,Signed?
00:03:41,00:03:42,Yeah.
00:03:42,00:03:43,By?
00:03:43,00:03:44,Your dad.
00:03:44,00:03:45,Of course.
00:03:45,00:03:46,He signs everything.
00:03:46,00:03:47,"If you can find a mug that isn't signed by dad, it's worth the fortune."
00:03:47,00:03:48,I'm just so excited.
00:03:48,00:03:50,I'm so just to level with everyone.
00:03:50,00:03:53,This is such an intense show to do.
00:03:53,00:03:55,There's so much prep.
00:03:55,00:03:56,It's like homework.
00:03:56,00:03:57,I've been cramming.
00:03:57,00:03:58,Yeah.
00:03:58,00:03:59,Where's your dad now?
00:03:59,00:04:00,Yeah.
00:04:00,00:04:03,I'm nothing without him as you're all about to see.
00:04:03,00:04:05,You should have got him to do your research.
00:04:05,00:04:06,That would have been incredible.
00:04:06,00:04:07,Oh my God.
00:04:07,00:04:08,Next time.
00:04:08,00:04:09,Next time.
00:04:09,00:04:10,"Well, listen, we've got a show to do."
00:04:10,00:04:13,"We don't have a tumbola, but we do have a competition, don't we?"
00:04:13,00:04:14,Absolutely.
00:04:14,00:04:17,"Because you guys have been sending in your facts, which I've got on my phone here."
00:04:17,00:04:20,What we're going to do is we're going to read a few of them out and then we're going
00:04:20,00:04:25,to choose one winner and that person will go into a head-to-head against our very special
00:04:25,00:04:27,guest tonight.
00:04:27,00:04:29,So it's a big prize.
00:04:29,00:04:31,I'll read out a few facts and we'll decide which is our favourite thing.
00:04:31,00:04:32,Okay.
00:04:32,00:04:33,So here's one.
00:04:33,00:04:34,It's not going to name on it.
00:04:34,00:04:38,It's from Road 0.2.
00:04:38,00:04:43,"They said a new spider has been discovered in Australia, which is now known to be the most"
00:04:43,00:04:45,dangerous spider.
00:04:45,00:04:53,It's a subspecies of the Sydney for the web and it's called the Newcastle Big Boy.
00:04:53,00:04:54,That is good.
00:04:54,00:04:55,That's a great face.
00:04:55,00:04:56,That's it.
00:04:56,00:04:57,Can we see the audience?
00:04:57,00:04:58,"Yes, please."
00:04:58,00:04:59,Who's that audience?
00:04:59,00:05:00,Confess.
00:05:00,00:05:01,"Oh, there it is."
00:05:01,00:05:02,Right at the back.
00:05:02,00:05:03,"Oh, the way."
00:05:03,00:05:06,The only spot that the light does not hit.
00:05:06,00:05:08,What's your name?
00:05:08,00:05:09,Charlie.
00:05:09,00:05:10,Charlie.
00:05:10,00:05:11,And are you from Australia?
00:05:11,00:05:12,"Oh, good."
00:05:12,00:05:13,"Oh, wow."
00:05:13,00:05:14,And here's another one.
00:05:14,00:05:18,This is from James and Kerry and this is much more low-brow.
00:05:18,00:05:21,House fly sperm is larger than human sperm.
00:05:21,00:05:22,Really?
00:05:22,00:05:23,What?
00:05:23,00:05:24,House fly sperm.
00:05:24,00:05:26,House fly sperm is larger than human sperm.
00:05:26,00:05:28,I know what a sperm I know about.
00:05:28,00:05:30,I've had 10 years of sperm.
00:05:30,00:05:31,Professionally.
00:05:31,00:05:32,How do you know this?
00:05:32,00:05:33,You know what I mean.
00:05:33,00:05:36,Five to six centriots is boiled up.
00:05:36,00:05:37,Five to six centriots.
00:05:37,00:05:38,And the house fly.
00:05:38,00:05:39,Brilliant.
00:05:39,00:05:41,"Well, here's another one."
00:05:41,00:05:43,"Again, I don't have a name on this."
00:05:43,00:05:46,This person says they're recovering from a broken ankle.
00:05:46,00:05:51,"It's a talus bone fracture, which is known as the aviator fracture, because when Spitfire"
00:05:51,00:05:56,"pilots crash landed their planes, they had to keep their feet on the pedals until"
00:05:56,00:06:00,they were safely down and so they would all break their ankles when they landed.
00:06:00,00:06:01,Yikes.
00:06:01,00:06:03,Who is the person with a broken ankle?
00:06:03,00:06:04,What's your name?
00:06:04,00:06:05,Sadie.
00:06:05,00:06:06,Sadie.
00:06:06,00:06:07,That's a terrific fact.
00:06:07,00:06:08,Do you want to choose one?
00:06:08,00:06:11,"Well, I guess Jamie, you're going to be going up against someone."
00:06:11,00:06:15,Who do you think you can beat those people?
00:06:15,00:06:16,What was it?
00:06:16,00:06:17,New culture people.
00:06:17,00:06:18,It's got to be the sperm.
00:06:18,00:06:19,I'm sorry.
00:06:19,00:06:20,OK.
00:06:20,00:06:24,"So, James or Kerry, would you be willing to come up on stage in a bit later?"
00:06:24,00:06:25,One of you.
00:06:25,00:06:26,Tell you when.
00:06:26,00:06:28,Stay where you are for now.
00:06:28,00:06:32,You've got a full hour to worry about it.
00:06:32,00:06:33,Kerry's just made very clear.
00:06:33,00:06:35,It's going to be James giving up on stage.
00:06:35,00:06:36,All right.
00:06:36,00:06:40,"Well, you guys ready for us to do a show?"
00:06:40,00:06:44,Roll the theme tune.
00:06:44,00:06:55,Hello and welcome to another episode of
00:06:55,00:06:58,"No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast."
00:06:58,00:07:06,This week coming to you live from the London Podcast Festival.
00:07:06,00:07:08,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:07:08,00:07:12,"I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin, and Jamie Morton."
00:07:12,00:07:16,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts"
00:07:16,00:07:17,from the last seven days.
00:07:17,00:07:21,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:07:21,00:07:24,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Jamie."
00:07:24,00:07:27,"No particular order, the guest first."
00:07:27,00:07:28,OK.
00:07:28,00:07:30,Don't destroy our show straight away.
00:07:30,00:07:31,It's just a light.
00:07:31,00:07:32,I like it.
00:07:32,00:07:33,OK.
00:07:33,00:07:40,"Iconic, Festbian, beer bone, had a walk on part in every single production at the Geal"
00:07:40,00:07:44,Good Theatre in London's West End for 20 years.
00:07:44,00:07:50,"And fittingly, had a front page obituary in the stage newspaper."
00:07:50,00:07:56,He was also a cat.
00:07:56,00:07:57,I know.
00:07:57,00:07:58,"I mean, like, what a hag."
00:07:58,00:07:59,I'm sorry.
00:07:59,00:08:01,That is a Festbian cat.
00:08:01,00:08:01,That is.
00:08:01,00:08:02,Yeah.
00:08:02,00:08:07,"For people listening on the podcast next week, or whenever it goes out, can you describe"
00:08:07,00:08:08,the cat who was Jamie?
00:08:08,00:08:10,"We've got a tabby cat, he's male."
00:08:10,00:08:14,And he's lounging on stage at the Geal Good.
00:08:14,00:08:16,Looking very happy with his beautifully lit.
00:08:16,00:08:17,It's black and white.
00:08:17,00:08:20,"It's very-- it sounds like a headshot, but it's a full body."
00:08:20,00:08:21,Yeah.
00:08:21,00:08:22,Yeah.
00:08:22,00:08:23,Shea's long kind of look.
00:08:23,00:08:24,That little-- is that a photo of a tail?
00:08:24,00:08:27,"He's like saying, paint me like one of your French cats."
00:08:27,00:08:28,It's giving that energy.
00:08:28,00:08:29,"Oh, yeah."
00:08:29,00:08:30,Yeah.
00:08:30,00:08:32,Say the opulence as well around it in terms of the architecture.
00:08:32,00:08:33,Yeah.
00:08:33,00:08:34,"I mean, I love this cat."
00:08:34,00:08:35,So--
00:08:35,00:08:36,I'm not going to lie.
00:08:36,00:08:37,I've fallen in love with him this week.
00:08:37,00:08:38,"I've never heard of him before, but now I love him."
00:08:38,00:08:43,"So when you say walk on roll in all the plays, was that official, was he-- was he written"
00:08:43,00:08:44,into--
00:08:44,00:08:45,No.
00:08:45,00:08:46,No.
00:08:46,00:08:49,Is the resident-- is it like Mouser?
00:08:49,00:08:50,Is that--
00:08:50,00:08:54,"Yeah, Mouser name that they caught the mice."
00:08:54,00:08:59,"And he just would randomly walk on stage during productions, which, being a theatre director,"
00:08:59,00:09:04,"I find chilling, because you work so hard to kind of make a show good, then some fucking"
00:09:04,00:09:07,cats just like wandering in front of everyone.
00:09:07,00:09:09,And what did the actors think of it?
00:09:09,00:09:10,Were they--
00:09:10,00:09:12,"Well, the actors, like, loved this cat."
00:09:12,00:09:16,"Like, almost uniformly, I think there wasn't a single actor who didn't love him."
00:09:16,00:09:21,"And he didn't love beer bone, because he is, as I said, a total hag."
00:09:21,00:09:23,"I mean, look at him."
00:09:23,00:09:29,"But yeah, he was loved, and-- and people got very attached to him."
00:09:29,00:09:33,So much so that he had this obituary on the front page of the stage newspaper.
00:09:33,00:09:37,"And people like Penelope Keith wrote obituries for him, like loads of actors kind of got involved."
00:09:37,00:09:42,"The stage, I hadn't heard of the stage, is that, like, the main, main thing that you"
00:09:42,00:09:43,can get on it?
00:09:43,00:09:44,The Bible.
00:09:44,00:09:45,"Dan, honestly."
00:09:45,00:09:46,"Oh, man."
00:09:46,00:09:47,I actually heard of it.
00:09:47,00:09:48,I was just being them for a second.
00:09:48,00:09:49,Yeah.
00:09:49,00:09:51,"Then they've heard of it, too."
00:09:51,00:09:54,"Oh, so it is just being-- it's a great news paper, yeah."
00:09:54,00:09:55,"No, it is."
00:09:55,00:09:56,It's a great news paper.
00:09:56,00:09:57,"It's behind a play wall, but it's great."
00:09:57,00:10:01,"OK, a lot of people did love beer bone, but beer bone would arrive on stage at moments"
00:10:01,00:10:04,that weren't necessarily good for a scene.
00:10:04,00:10:07,"You know, there was one-- there was one play that was on, which was called the House of"
00:10:07,00:10:12,"Bernard Alba, which had a lot of sand all over the stage."
00:10:12,00:10:13,"Oh, no."
00:10:13,00:10:18,Beer bone was the ultimate pooing ground.
00:10:18,00:10:21,"That was not good, right, at this moment."
00:10:21,00:10:22,Not good for who?
00:10:22,00:10:23,We loved it.
00:10:23,00:10:24,It adds realism to the play.
00:10:24,00:10:25,"Oh, yeah."
00:10:25,00:10:26,That's where it's set.
00:10:26,00:10:31,"If it's set in the pitiless desert of the Sahara, it actually, I would say, kills the"
00:10:31,00:10:33,mood a bit to have a house cat.
00:10:33,00:10:34,There are enough.
00:10:34,00:10:38,"Some people think it's good luck for a cat to be on stage, and in America, at least, there"
00:10:38,00:10:44,"was a superstition that if a black cat came into the theatre, that was really good luck."
00:10:44,00:10:47,"And if it came on the first night, that was really, really good luck, and the whole show"
00:10:47,00:10:48,was going to be amazing.
00:10:48,00:10:49,Right.
00:10:49,00:10:55,"And so the fifth avenue theatre in New York used to keep a black cat backstage, and then"
00:10:55,00:11:00,"on the first show of every run, that they would throw it out there so that it was on stage."
00:11:00,00:11:01,And that was good luck.
00:11:01,00:11:02,"Oh, yeah."
00:11:02,00:11:06,"And the reason you said ""Mouser"" a second ago, Jamie, the reason that cats used to be very,"
00:11:06,00:11:11,"very important in theatre is because back in the day, food being thrown on stage to show"
00:11:11,00:11:14,your all-pleasure or pleasure in a play was a massive thing.
00:11:14,00:11:17,"So at the end of every night, food was just everywhere, all over the stage, which brought"
00:11:17,00:11:20,"in the mice, and mice were a huge, huge problem."
00:11:20,00:11:25,"So theatres would have, sometimes, up to 20 cats roaming around, catching mice if they"
00:11:25,00:11:26,had problems.
00:11:26,00:11:29,But a lot of those cats would lie on their CVs.
00:11:29,00:11:31,You've put on who you also do birds.
00:11:31,00:11:32,Is that true?
00:11:32,00:11:33,"Oh, yeah."
00:11:33,00:11:34,Yeah.
00:11:34,00:11:37,"The film was on the payroll, I read."
00:11:37,00:11:41,"He was officially listed on the Gilgur payroll, which, as a former accountant, I think brings"
00:11:41,00:11:43,up a whole host of problems.
00:11:43,00:11:46,"Like, who pays the national insurance on that?"
00:11:46,00:11:47,Yep.
00:11:47,00:11:48,I wonder who his agent was?
00:11:48,00:11:49,I don't know.
00:11:49,00:11:50,Someone bloody good.
00:11:50,00:11:51,15% of a count.
00:11:51,00:11:55,"And apparently, he would disappear from time to time, according to Dame Hilda Brackett,"
00:11:55,00:11:59,he would dash off to see a particular friend at the Lyric theatre.
00:11:59,00:12:00,His girlfriend?
00:12:00,00:12:01,Yeah.
00:12:01,00:12:03,"She said, ""We used to hear lots of meows."
00:12:03,00:12:05,"This was so how after all."""
00:12:05,00:12:06,I love it.
00:12:06,00:12:10,"Do you think, well, look, most West Enfielders have cats, as you said."
00:12:10,00:12:11,Yeah.
00:12:11,00:12:12,They're all mates.
00:12:12,00:12:13,"Do you think they just, like, all meet up at..."
00:12:13,00:12:17,"Oh, that's a cute, that's a great show, though, that you should have seen the performers"
00:12:17,00:12:18,for this.
00:12:18,00:12:22,"Well, the lots of theatres did have cats in there."
00:12:22,00:12:27,"So the Noel Cow Theatre had two cats, imaginative, called Girl Cat and Boy Cat."
00:12:27,00:12:32,And I think Boy Cat only ever distinguished himself once when he ate Princess Margaret's
00:12:32,00:12:33,bouquet.
00:12:33,00:12:34,Is that a euphemism?
00:12:34,00:12:35,"No, it's not."
00:12:35,00:12:39,"It's a bloody good one, isn't it?"
00:12:39,00:12:44,"Yeah, apparently, he also escaped offstage during a performance of a musical five-guys'"
00:12:44,00:12:49,"name Moe, and he would go under the stage and he would only come out when someone tapped"
00:12:49,00:12:50,out Stolverham.
00:12:50,00:12:51,Right.
00:12:51,00:12:57,"There was a cat called Ambrose at the theatre Royal Jury Lane, which I think you've performed"
00:12:57,00:12:58,at.
00:12:58,00:12:59,"Oh, yeah."
00:12:59,00:13:03,And this cat got into a beef with Michael Crawford.
00:13:03,00:13:08,He kept upstaging Michael Crawford and Michael Crawford had no sense of humour about this.
00:13:08,00:13:11,"It's Michael Crawford, the original phantom, yes."
00:13:11,00:13:12,But was he also Frank Spencer?
00:13:12,00:13:13,"Yeah, Frank Spencer."
00:13:13,00:13:14,Open tea.
00:13:14,00:13:15,That guy.
00:13:15,00:13:16,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:13:16,00:13:17,"A varied career, I think."
00:13:17,00:13:18,I was going to say yellow.
00:13:18,00:13:22,"But then, and so, Michael Crawford was like kicking off about this cat, but every single"
00:13:22,00:13:25,person in the theatre took the cat's side.
00:13:25,00:13:26,What does that say?
00:13:26,00:13:27,Wow.
00:13:27,00:13:31,I read about one that was at the Sadler's Wells.
00:13:31,00:13:36,"It was called Sadler, the cat, and Sadler in 1956 just suddenly disappeared."
00:13:36,00:13:40,"But unlike the other cats who would come on unprompted, Sadler actually had a role in"
00:13:40,00:13:41,a play.
00:13:41,00:13:42,"Oh, no."
00:13:42,00:13:47,"So, in the stage, magazine, they had an advert to audition for a new cat for the show, and"
00:13:47,00:13:48,I found the advert.
00:13:48,00:13:53,"It said, owing to the dramatic disappearance of Sadler, official theatre cat at the Wells,"
00:13:53,00:13:57,the important feline role and the forthcoming production of School of Fathers falls vacant
00:13:57,00:14:03,"or additions will be held, applicants must be fully grown and capable of maintaining dignity"
00:14:03,00:14:08,"and poise atop a 10-foot high wall, despite the distractions of a full, operatic orchestra"
00:14:08,00:14:10,and audience laughter and applause.
00:14:10,00:14:14,"The chosen artist will receive full her service, one sardine and two complementary tickets"
00:14:14,00:14:15,per performance.
00:14:15,00:14:17,Wow.
00:14:17,00:14:19,And did you see who got the part?
00:14:19,00:14:20,No.
00:14:20,00:14:24,"It was a cat called Keats, and according to the Daily Telegraphy beat off tough composition"
00:14:24,00:14:31,"from cats called Fantasia, Nimbus, Klott and Mr Woodbury Bentley."
00:14:31,00:14:32,And they had two auditions.
00:14:32,00:14:37,"In the second audition, he jumped off the wall that he was sitting on and then walked over"
00:14:37,00:14:42,"to the bar and started knocking down bottles, and they decided this was a perfect cat for"
00:14:42,00:14:43,the theatre.
00:14:43,00:14:47,"You know, this is exactly what the old actors would do, so, yeah."
00:14:47,00:14:48,So good.
00:14:48,00:14:49,How can you cast a cat in a play?
00:14:49,00:14:53,"They just, they famously don't play bull, well, they play with bulls, but you know what"
00:14:53,00:14:54,I mean.
00:14:54,00:14:55,Yeah.
00:14:55,00:14:56,I know.
00:14:56,00:14:57,"To direct, I would imagine."
00:14:57,00:14:58,Yeah.
00:14:58,00:14:59,"Dogs, I think, do get a look in sometimes on the West End."
00:14:59,00:15:02,I was trying to find other animals that have been in West End productions.
00:15:02,00:15:03,Yeah.
00:15:03,00:15:04,"Oh, yeah."
00:15:04,00:15:08,So there was a Guardian report in 2001 that there was a production of The Taming of the
00:15:08,00:15:11,"True, which had an entire cast of chickens, and I cannot find out whether it was like a"
00:15:11,00:15:16,whole flock of chickens and a human cast or whether it was an entire cast of chickens.
00:15:16,00:15:17,Ah.
00:15:17,00:15:18,Like.
00:15:18,00:15:20,"But when they all fired, I think."
00:15:20,00:15:21,"They were sacked, yes."
00:15:21,00:15:22,Yeah.
00:15:22,00:15:23,Apparently for being too hysterical.
00:15:23,00:15:27,I don't know what the hysterical chicken can't imagine how hysterical they got when they
00:15:27,00:15:28,were told they were fired.
00:15:28,00:15:29,Yeah.
00:15:29,00:15:30,That's the big on the room.
00:15:30,00:15:31,"Guys, we're going to have fun."
00:15:31,00:15:32,You go.
00:15:32,00:15:35,"By the way, beer bomb, the cat."
00:15:35,00:15:36,Do we know?
00:15:36,00:15:38,Do you guys know why it's called beer bomb?
00:15:38,00:15:40,"There was a famous actor called beer, but I don't know what they're going to say."
00:15:40,00:15:41,Yeah.
00:15:41,00:15:42,He was a theater manager.
00:15:42,00:15:43,He was an actor as well.
00:15:43,00:15:48,"His name was Sir Herbert Beerbomb Tree, and he founded Rada, the Royal Academy of Dramatic"
00:15:48,00:15:49,Arts.
00:15:49,00:15:50,Yeah.
00:15:50,00:15:51,"And he's a pretty, he's a pretty amazing character."
00:15:51,00:15:52,He released a few records.
00:15:52,00:15:55,He did hamlets to be or not to be on vinyl.
00:15:55,00:15:56,That's pretty cool.
00:15:56,00:15:59,It's just really sin his own stuff.
00:15:59,00:16:04,"But he also, he's from the Beerbomb family, which is quite an amazing family, Max Beerbomb."
00:16:04,00:16:07,The satirical writer was part of that family.
00:16:07,00:16:11,Virtually every child that he had was part of some major bit of theater in the day.
00:16:11,00:16:14,He had a lot of illegitimate children as well.
00:16:14,00:16:18,His grandson from one of those moments was Oliver Reed.
00:16:18,00:16:20,So he's very connected.
00:16:20,00:16:24,"He's basically the reason that Shakespeare is so popular today, Beerbomb Tree, I think."
00:16:24,00:16:25,Right.
00:16:25,00:16:27,"Yeah, because in those days, so this was what?"
00:16:27,00:16:29,It was 19th century.
00:16:29,00:16:33,"People were kind of putting Shakespeare on, but it was very stuffy."
00:16:33,00:16:34,People didn't really like it.
00:16:34,00:16:35,It was going out of fashion.
00:16:35,00:16:39,And then he started putting loads of Shakespeare plays on and making them real sort of blockbuster
00:16:39,00:16:43,shows so that everyone loved to go there and loved to see it.
00:16:43,00:16:47,"And he was also the person who put, I think, the first film Shakespeare?"
00:16:47,00:16:49,I think he was the guy who did that as well.
00:16:49,00:16:49,Right.
00:16:49,00:16:53,"He went over to America and did a hamlet on my path, I was up in."
00:16:53,00:16:54,Right.
00:16:54,00:16:55,"Yeah, he's a..."
00:16:55,00:16:56,"So he's what's a blame, basically?"
00:16:56,00:16:57,"Yeah, yeah."
00:16:57,00:17:03,"And also, randomly, in the play ""Cats,"" there is a reference which is said to Gus from"
00:17:03,00:17:04,"""Geliorum."""
00:17:04,00:17:05,Is that the name of the cat in it?

00:17:18,00:17:19,"Boy, it just makes you think, doesn't it?"
00:17:19,00:17:20,Yeah.

00:18:20,00:18:21,Why do you think they used so many condoms?

00:18:24,00:18:25,What sort of thing?
00:18:25,00:18:27,You smuggle drugs for the cast.

00:18:33,00:18:34,Is it?
00:18:34,00:18:35,Okay.
00:18:35,00:18:36,"Oh, is it for..."
00:18:36,00:18:43,"So a lot of preppers will use condoms to store water because a condom, like a water balloon,"
00:18:43,00:18:44,holds gallons of water.
00:18:44,00:18:45,Absolutely not.
00:18:45,00:18:46,I know.

00:18:58,00:18:59,Yes.
00:18:59,00:19:03,So it's to protect the claws in transit and they had 49...
00:19:03,00:19:05,"Well, real cats have claws."
00:19:05,00:19:06,This is a show with people.
00:19:06,00:19:07,Yeah.
00:19:07,00:19:08,"Alright, put us out and move."
00:19:08,00:19:09,It was...
00:19:09,00:19:10,"You were right, James."
00:19:10,00:19:13,It was to protect their microphone packs.
00:19:13,00:19:15,"They were sweating so much because it's a dance show, right?"
00:19:15,00:19:18,They're dancing so much that they would put their mic packs in condoms.
00:19:18,00:19:19,"49,000?"
00:19:19,00:19:20,Yeah.
00:19:20,00:19:24,"After each show, they're just like tip loads of condoms in the bin outside of this."
00:19:24,00:19:26,"Oh, it's a sweet show."
00:19:26,00:19:32,"While we're on Andrew Lloyd Webber, there's another cat connection, which is the fact that"
00:19:32,00:19:34,Phantom of the Opera now has a sequel.
00:19:34,00:19:38,"Many, many years ago Lloyd Webber was working on that sequel and he was rising it with"
00:19:38,00:19:40,"Frederick Forsyth, the author."
00:19:40,00:19:42,"The author, the author, exactly."
00:19:42,00:19:43,So they were writing it.
00:19:43,00:19:47,He'd written all the music and he had it on his electric piano and then one day he sat
00:19:47,00:19:53,"down to write a new song and his kitten, called Otto, stepped on the keyboard and erased the"
00:19:53,00:19:55,entire score.
00:19:55,00:19:56,And so we never got it.
00:19:56,00:20:00,"The main thing about Cat Charlie is the movie, the amazing movie that came out a few years ago."
00:20:00,00:20:01,"Oh, yeah."
00:20:01,00:20:03,"And it was really the start of the pandemic, I think."
00:20:03,00:20:05,"It was right at the start of the pandemic, wasn't it?"
00:20:05,00:20:06,Yeah.
00:20:06,00:20:07,I was at that moment.
00:20:07,00:20:08,It was the pandemic.
00:20:08,00:20:09,I don't know.
00:20:09,00:20:10,It was not longer.
00:20:10,00:20:15,We knew something bad was in the air when cats came out.
00:20:15,00:20:20,And the big thing about that is the CGI bumholes that all the cats had.
00:20:20,00:20:21,Wow.
00:20:21,00:20:22,Isn't it?
00:20:22,00:20:26,"Well, there is, is it true or not, because that is urban myth, is it true?"
00:20:26,00:20:27,It's urban myth.
00:20:27,00:20:32,"So someone tweeted, a guy called Jack Waz, and I think, I mean, that sounds like an honest"
00:20:32,00:20:33,"man, doesn't it?"
00:20:33,00:20:34,Jack Waz.
00:20:34,00:20:37,"The thing is James, you go to such impeccable lengths to source all of your facts."
00:20:37,00:20:41,"Like James goes deep into newspaper archives from 200 years ago, but he will also sometimes"
00:20:41,00:20:45,"throw in like, at Jack Waz, I don't know."
00:20:45,00:20:48,At Jack Waz is the New York Times of our day.
00:20:48,00:20:55,"He said that a VFX producer, friend of a friend, was hired to get rid of the bumholes, right?"
00:20:55,00:21:01,"But then the Daily Beast online magazine found a VFX person, and they said it was true."
00:21:01,00:21:03,And they were definitely someone who worked on the show.
00:21:03,00:21:08,And they said what had happened was actually the way the visual effects worked is they had
00:21:08,00:21:11,a very special way of the fur being made.
00:21:11,00:21:15,"And the fur would go in little like holes, like your hair does, you know, you have walls in"
00:21:15,00:21:16,your hair.
00:21:16,00:21:19,"And so they had them on all the cats, and it just so happened that if you got them any"
00:21:19,00:21:26,"of them from a certain angle, it looked like they had female genitalia or an anus."
00:21:26,00:21:31,And they had to imply one person who basically it was their job to go through looking for
00:21:31,00:21:33,the bumholes and then get rid of them.
00:21:33,00:21:34,Right.
00:21:34,00:21:35,That's insane.
00:21:35,00:21:37,That's such a high pressure job as well.
00:21:37,00:21:39,"You've got to catch every single one, you know?"
00:21:39,00:21:40,It's true.
00:21:40,00:21:41,"Yeah, yeah."
00:21:41,00:21:42,I put them on.
00:21:42,00:21:43,Yeah.
00:21:43,00:21:44,I love it.
00:21:44,00:21:48,"They could catch all of the bumholes, but not Judith and she's wedding ring, which is on"
00:21:48,00:21:49,throughout the fucking process.
00:21:49,00:21:50,How is it?
00:21:50,00:21:51,As like an old cat.
00:21:51,00:21:54,"So you got all of the rings, but one in the end."
00:21:54,00:21:55,Is that good?
00:21:55,00:21:57,"Hey, I need to move us on to our next fight."
00:21:57,00:21:58,"Oh, oh."
00:21:58,00:21:59,"Oh, they just have one more thing."
00:21:59,00:22:00,"Yeah, sure, yeah."
00:22:00,00:22:02,"Alice Swift's cat, right?"
00:22:02,00:22:03,In the movie.
00:22:03,00:22:04,She's in the film.
00:22:04,00:22:05,"Oh, no, I mean her actual cat."
00:22:05,00:22:06,Yes.
00:22:06,00:22:08,It's called Olivia Benson.
00:22:08,00:22:17,And it is reportedly worth over double the net worth of her fiance.
00:22:17,00:22:19,It's her fiance Kelsey.
00:22:19,00:22:20,"Yeah, yeah."
00:22:20,00:22:24,But Travis Kelsey is worth a mega $40 million.
00:22:24,00:22:31,This fucking cat is worth 97 million dollars.
00:22:31,00:22:36,And it says that most of that wealth has come from the cat's TV commercial work and Swift's
00:22:36,00:22:39,music videos of blank space and me.
00:22:39,00:22:40,It's called.
00:22:40,00:22:41,Okay.
00:22:41,00:22:42,Where it's made all of its money.
00:22:42,00:22:43,What's the source of it?
00:22:43,00:22:44,Is this jacket?
00:22:44,00:22:45,Yeah.
00:22:45,00:22:46,I'm not buying it.
00:22:46,00:22:47,That's very interesting.
00:22:47,00:22:48,Yeah.
00:22:48,00:22:49,Wow.
00:22:49,00:22:51,How awful that her cat is worth double her fiance.
00:22:51,00:22:52,I think it's okay.
00:22:52,00:22:53,"No, it is okay."
00:22:53,00:22:55,How many Super Bowls is he won?
00:22:55,00:22:56,That's the thing.
00:22:56,00:22:58,Kelsey's won a couple of Super Bowls.
00:22:58,00:22:59,I see.
00:22:59,00:23:02,I thought you meant Kelsey Grammer who played Frazier.
00:23:02,00:23:05,It's just as two brothers that I can never remember which ones.
00:23:05,00:23:08,Because I know a lot more about NFL than I do about Taylor Swift.
00:23:08,00:23:09,Is the truth.
00:23:09,00:23:10,So name is Kelsey.
00:23:10,00:23:11,I understand that.
00:23:11,00:23:12,Cool.
00:23:12,00:23:16,"Interestingly, the one only major other pop culture reference to Herbert Beerbom Tree"
00:23:16,00:23:18,is in an episode of Frazier with Kelsey Grammer.
00:23:18,00:23:19,No.
00:23:19,00:23:20,Yeah.
00:23:20,00:23:21,Who would have thought that would come up?
00:23:21,00:23:23,It's in a thing called...
00:23:23,00:23:25,"This is all scripts, you guys."
00:23:25,00:23:27,It's in the episode Daphne's Room.
00:23:27,00:23:31,The plot involves Frazier's retrieval of a book from her room called The Life and Times
00:23:31,00:23:33,of Sohera Burt Beerbom Tree.
00:23:33,00:23:34,Great.
00:23:34,00:23:35,"Anyway, moving on."
00:23:35,00:23:38,It's great to end with a bang.
00:23:38,00:23:39,You know?
00:23:39,00:23:40,Actually.
00:23:40,00:23:41,Yeah.
00:23:41,00:23:46,So it's time for fact number two.
00:23:46,00:23:47,And that is my fact.
00:23:47,00:23:53,"My fact this week is that at one of the oldest bath houses in Japan, visitors have the"
00:23:53,00:24:07,"option of soaking in hot water, cold water, electric water or condom water."
00:24:07,00:24:08,We need to call them and suggest that.
00:24:08,00:24:09,No.
00:24:09,00:24:10,The final one.
00:24:10,00:24:13,"There are many others, but the other one is radioactive water."
00:24:13,00:24:14,Ooh.
00:24:14,00:24:15,Yeah.
00:24:15,00:24:16,People also drink this water.
00:24:16,00:24:20,"So it turns out I thought this was going to be unique to this one place in Japan, which"
00:24:20,00:24:27,"is a radium onsen, an onsen as a word that means bath houses in Japan that use hot spring"
00:24:27,00:24:30,water and they take natural source water.
00:24:30,00:24:31,And they use that.
00:24:31,00:24:35,"There's something like 25,000 hot spring sources in Japan that are used there everywhere."
00:24:35,00:24:36,Yeah.
00:24:36,00:24:39,"And 3,000 onsen establishments all over Japan."
00:24:39,00:24:40,So it's a real big thing there.
00:24:40,00:24:45,"And so like the electric water that you would sit in, that actually sends mild electric"
00:24:45,00:24:47,currents through the water as you're sitting in it.
00:24:47,00:24:52,And people describe it as like being tickled by lightning as you're trying to relax.
00:24:52,00:24:53,How relaxing.
00:24:53,00:24:54,Yeah.
00:24:54,00:24:58,"Well, they see these baths not as necessarily completely relaxing."
00:24:58,00:25:01,"It's all about rejuvenation, it's all about health and so on."
00:25:01,00:25:04,"And so radioactive water, radium water is a thing."
00:25:04,00:25:07,"It's not bad for you, is it?"
00:25:07,00:25:09,"The quantities are really, really small."
00:25:09,00:25:14,"The quantities are less than you would get if you were on a flight, for example."
00:25:14,00:25:16,But that's flight.
00:25:16,00:25:21,"You know, we get hit by radioactive, you know, flares from space as you're on a flight."
00:25:21,00:25:25,"So James, quick jump in."
00:25:25,00:25:30,"There is radiation that comes from space and if the closer you are to it, the less space."
00:25:30,00:25:31,Space.
00:25:31,00:25:32,Space.
00:25:32,00:25:33,It's a flight.
00:25:33,00:25:34,Not Katy Perry.
00:25:34,00:25:35,But it means you.
00:25:35,00:25:41,But there's less of the atmosphere to block it out when your fervor up is the basics.
00:25:41,00:25:43,"But if you're on a plane all the time, it'll be bad for you."
00:25:43,00:25:47,"Like a air hostess or a pilot, for example, and it's bad for you."
00:25:47,00:25:48,It's bad for you.
00:25:48,00:25:50,What the hell are you talking about?
00:25:50,00:25:53,They said that like it's safest way to travel.
00:25:53,00:25:54,No.
00:25:54,00:25:56,"But if you live in Cornwall, there's radiation there too."
00:25:56,00:25:57,Yeah.
00:25:57,00:26:01,But here's some good lead box at the end of this.
00:26:01,00:26:03,So there is radiation in Cornwall.
00:26:03,00:26:07,"Cornwall has more background radiation than anywhere else, but we all have a little bit."
00:26:07,00:26:13,And a normal person would get two to three millisieverts of radiation in a year.
00:26:13,00:26:17,"Well, there's a place called Ramsai in a run that has the highest radiation anywhere in"
00:26:17,00:26:18,the world.
00:26:18,00:26:21,It's because they have hot springs and radiation underground and it comes up.
00:26:21,00:26:27,"And they get 260 millisieverts per year, which is more than 100 times what a normal person"
00:26:27,00:26:28,would get.
00:26:28,00:26:33,"But actually, the cancer incidence there is lower than any of their neighbours."
00:26:33,00:26:34,Right.
00:26:34,00:26:38,"And what people think is the people who live there, they have a higher proportion of what's"
00:26:38,00:26:39,called T cells.
00:26:39,00:26:42,"Remember in Covid, they said T cells, it's like, helped your immune system."
00:26:42,00:26:45,And it turns out that people there have got higher proportion of T cells and it's the thing
00:26:45,00:26:51,"called Hormesis, which is the idea that very small low doses of something that would otherwise"
00:26:51,00:26:54,be harmful can actually make you stronger.
00:26:54,00:26:59,"And it is really, I mean, I'm not saying everyone should go out now and get as much radiation"
00:26:59,00:27:00,as possible.
00:27:00,00:27:01,But it is.
00:27:01,00:27:02,You just have a great time.
00:27:02,00:27:03,That's amazing.
00:27:03,00:27:04,Yeah.
00:27:04,00:27:05,That really is amazing.
00:27:05,00:27:06,It's very cool.
00:27:06,00:27:10,"So as I was saying a second ago, these are massive in Japan and I was trying to find more"
00:27:10,00:27:14,information about this very specific one in Osaka.
00:27:14,00:27:20,And the best place I could find out about it was a website called tatufriendlyonson.com.
00:27:20,00:27:26,"And this is so interesting because in Japan, when you go to an onsen, largely it's separated."
00:27:26,00:27:27,So men will go into one place.
00:27:27,00:27:28,One will go into another.
00:27:28,00:27:29,You have to be naked.
00:27:29,00:27:30,You've got to be completely naked.
00:27:30,00:27:35,"And the problem is in Japan, if you have tattoos, you're not allowed to go and show"
00:27:35,00:27:37,your tattoos in these places because of the yakuza.
00:27:37,00:27:39,So a lot of foreigners arrive trying to go...
00:27:39,00:27:41,Because they're the gangsters.
00:27:41,00:27:42,Yeah.
00:27:42,00:27:43,The mafia basically.
00:27:43,00:27:44,Yeah.
00:27:44,00:27:45,"Who are tattoos, typically."
00:27:45,00:27:46,Yeah.
00:27:46,00:27:47,Exactly.
00:27:47,00:27:51,"And so if you arrive and you've got like, you know, like, eternity, I love cherry, whatever"
00:27:51,00:27:52,on your face.
00:27:52,00:27:53,I love...
00:27:53,00:27:57,"It's so revealing knowing what you would have gone for, though."
00:27:57,00:27:59,I didn't want to talk about my actual tattoos.
00:27:59,00:28:00,Okay.
00:28:00,00:28:01,I will.
00:28:01,00:28:02,"So, thug life across your..."
00:28:02,00:28:03,You tell me.
00:28:03,00:28:06,They won't let you in because of the yakuza thing.
00:28:06,00:28:10,So this website basically lists all of the onsens that you can go to and that will allow
00:28:10,00:28:11,you in.
00:28:11,00:28:16,Do you think the pork broth onsen would be one of those tattoo friendly ones?
00:28:16,00:28:17,I think it might be.
00:28:17,00:28:18,Yeah.
00:28:18,00:28:19,This is amazing.
00:28:19,00:28:20,This is...
00:28:20,00:28:21,There's a place.
00:28:21,00:28:22,"Well, it's the pork broth hot tub."
00:28:22,00:28:24,It's the Unison Spa.
00:28:24,00:28:27,"And they have a massive ramen bath, basically."
00:28:27,00:28:29,And it's just slightly porky hot water.
00:28:29,00:28:30,It sounds amazing.
00:28:30,00:28:31,It's a noodles in there.
00:28:31,00:28:35,"Well, they dangle above you a huge sculpture that looks like a pair of tropsticks holding"
00:28:35,00:28:36,noodles.
00:28:36,00:28:38,So it looks like you're about to be...
00:28:38,00:28:40,It's like you're a soft boiled egg.
00:28:40,00:28:41,It's like you're a...
00:28:41,00:28:42,Yeah.
00:28:42,00:28:46,"And as you've seen my physique, that I am like a soft boiled egg, basically."
00:28:46,00:28:47,But they've got a green tea bath.
00:28:47,00:28:50,"They've got a sake bath, which is very slightly sake."
00:28:50,00:28:53,"It's not obviously not all sake, because that'd be hugely expensive."
00:28:53,00:28:56,"They've got a coffee bath, which does not look appetising."
00:28:56,00:28:57,Yeah.
00:28:57,00:28:59,It looks really gross.
00:28:59,00:29:00,It's...
00:29:00,00:29:03,"It's safe if you have the runs, isn't it?"
00:29:03,00:29:04,"Oh, yes."
00:29:04,00:29:05,Absolutely.
00:29:05,00:29:06,Yeah.
00:29:06,00:29:07,That sounds...
00:29:07,00:29:08,I'd love to go there.
00:29:08,00:29:09,It does look cool.
00:29:09,00:29:10,Sounds awesome.
00:29:10,00:29:12,"I have been to Anonsan, a few, in fact, in Japan."
00:29:12,00:29:13,Really?
00:29:13,00:29:19,"There's a thing in Japan called Hadakano Sukui, which means naked camaraderie."
00:29:19,00:29:21,And the idea is everyone gets naked.
00:29:21,00:29:25,You're all together in a big sort of jacuzzi with no bubbles.
00:29:25,00:29:30,"And it means you're all emotionally together, open, honest."
00:29:30,00:29:31,That's the idea behind it.
00:29:31,00:29:34,"And I must admit, I went in, ran in, had a bath."
00:29:34,00:29:36,I just came out and went back to my room as quickly as I could.
00:29:36,00:29:37,"Oh, right."
00:29:37,00:29:38,You didn't have any...
00:29:38,00:29:39,Not very communal for you then.
00:29:39,00:29:40,I don't speak Japanese.
00:29:40,00:29:43,But there are other ways of communicating then.
00:29:43,00:29:47,"Yeah, but naked charades are the best of times is difficult."
00:29:47,00:29:49,I'm just a harkest back to the last fact.
00:29:49,00:29:52,You know that Andrew Lloyd Webber has a 30-person hot tub.
00:29:52,00:29:53,That's disgusting.
00:29:53,00:29:54,Does he?
00:29:54,00:29:59,"So it's a 30-person hot tub, meaning everyone gets a slot on the outer wall."
00:29:59,00:30:00,I believe.
00:30:00,00:30:01,What's the alternative?
00:30:01,00:30:06,That it could go a bus format where it is like six by four.
00:30:06,00:30:07,"Like, what's the..."
00:30:07,00:30:08,Yeah.
00:30:08,00:30:09,What?
00:30:09,00:30:11,There's an aisle down the middle.
00:30:11,00:30:13,"Tickets, please."
00:30:13,00:30:15,Chicken of fish.
00:30:15,00:30:16,Nuts.
00:30:16,00:30:17,"No, we don't have any."
00:30:17,00:30:18,I can just concede.
00:30:18,00:30:19,"No, I don't..."
00:30:19,00:30:20,"Yeah, I don't know what..."
00:30:20,00:30:21,"Yeah, I don't know."
00:30:21,00:30:22,I think it must be...
00:30:22,00:30:23,Everyone gets a bit of wall.
00:30:23,00:30:26,"Otherwise, you're just popping about in the middle, feeling like a..."
00:30:26,00:30:27,"Like a lemon, yeah."
00:30:27,00:30:28,"I hate that bit, yeah."
00:30:28,00:30:29,"Oh, yeah."
00:30:29,00:30:30,Bobbing.
00:30:30,00:30:36,"Bob, in the Southern Island of Tremacutu, and it opened up, I think, in 2017."
00:30:36,00:30:38,They'd announced it with big fanfare the year before.
00:30:38,00:30:41,"They said, ""This is going to be a... actually, it wasn't a spa."
00:30:41,00:30:44,"It was a spa-themed amusement park."""
00:30:44,00:30:50,"And they had released some images of, basically, a rollercoaster that's full of bath rollercoaster."
00:30:50,00:30:51,Okay.
00:30:51,00:30:54,"What, you're in a little bath, and that's your..."
00:30:54,00:30:55,Yeah.
00:30:55,00:30:56,You know you get in the carriage.
00:30:56,00:30:57,Yeah.
00:30:57,00:30:58,And it's a bath.
00:30:58,00:30:59,Wow.
00:30:59,00:31:00,And you're in a spa.
00:31:00,00:31:01,So they were not sure at the time if it could be done.
00:31:01,00:31:02,Yeah.
00:31:02,00:31:05,"It was, like, beyond the, the can of humanity, but they, they, they did it."
00:31:05,00:31:09,"So you're in a compartment that is a jacuzzi, basically?"
00:31:09,00:31:12,I think they didn't quite correct the full rollercoaster bath.
00:31:12,00:31:13,Yeah.
00:31:13,00:31:15,"Because that would have been very heavy, obviously."
00:31:15,00:31:16,It was spill a lot.
00:31:16,00:31:17,It was spill a lot.
00:31:17,00:31:18,Yeah.
00:31:18,00:31:19,It's like an opposite log flume.
00:31:19,00:31:20,Yeah.
00:31:20,00:31:21,But water's in.
00:31:21,00:31:24,"If you're really unlucky, you'll be dry at the end of it."
00:31:24,00:31:25,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:31:25,00:31:27,All the people waiting on the cycle.
00:31:27,00:31:28,"Oh, hang on."
00:31:28,00:31:29,Yeah.
00:31:29,00:31:30,Yeah.
00:31:30,00:31:31,That's very interesting.
00:31:31,00:31:33,"There's another one, which I wonder if that's there as well, where you have an option of"
00:31:33,00:31:36,arriving and they bury you up to your neck and sand.
00:31:36,00:31:41,"And it's quite hot sand so that you can get whatever, you know, holistic therapy."
00:31:41,00:31:47,"So have you done, have you ever done any sort of odd pampering things like this?"
00:31:47,00:31:49,"Um, that you're willing to admit too?"
00:31:49,00:31:50,Yeah.
00:31:50,00:31:54,I was quite intrigued by the beer baths that you can do.
00:31:54,00:31:56,"You know, in Europe, in like the Czech Republic, like, there's a lot, they're quite popular"
00:31:56,00:31:57,now.
00:31:57,00:32:01,"Um, it's like bathing, like, hoppy water, a bit like your ramen."
00:32:01,00:32:02,"Right, right, right."
00:32:02,00:32:05,"I wonder if you'd be interested in this, uh, this thing in Japan."
00:32:05,00:32:07,It's the Nightingale Fese's Facial.
00:32:07,00:32:10,"Now, it's not what it sounds like."
00:32:10,00:32:15,"It's Fese's from the Japanese Bushwabler, which is not a true Nightingale."
00:32:15,00:32:16,Oh.
00:32:16,00:32:17,Oh.
00:32:17,00:32:18,Thank God.
00:32:18,00:32:23,"In Japanese, it's brilliantly called Uguisu No Fun."
00:32:23,00:32:24,Right.
00:32:24,00:32:28,"And apparently anyone around you, because you stink of shit."
00:32:28,00:32:29,Yeah.
00:32:29,00:32:31,"Apparently, Victoria Beckham is a proponent of it."
00:32:31,00:32:32,"Oh, yeah."
00:32:32,00:32:33,Wow.
00:32:33,00:32:34,Okay.
00:32:34,00:32:35,That's extreme.
00:32:35,00:32:39,"I read about the, uh, the crying therapy rooms, which seems really nice."
00:32:39,00:32:41,The whole idea is to make you a sad as you could possibly be.
00:32:41,00:32:46,So you go in and you sit down and there's just sad movies playing on the screen and someone
00:32:46,00:32:49,"sits next to you, just going to ask really sad, isn't it?"
00:32:49,00:32:52,And then they hand you tissues as you're crying.
00:32:52,00:32:55,Just me.
00:32:55,00:32:56,Okay.
00:32:56,00:32:57,Give that one some bigger.
00:32:57,00:32:58,"No, that sounds nice."
00:32:58,00:33:00,So we've got to have a good cry.
00:33:00,00:33:01,Yeah.
00:33:01,00:33:02,Yeah.
00:33:02,00:33:03,Yeah.
00:33:03,00:33:04,"Yeah, I'd buy that."
00:33:04,00:33:05,Just going back to Onsen.
00:33:05,00:33:10,"So these baths, would you eat an Onsen Tamago, which is a traditional Japanese egg, which"
00:33:10,00:33:13,is cooked in a Onsen?
00:33:13,00:33:15,You put your egg in a rope net.
00:33:15,00:33:20,You put it in the Onsen and the water is about 70 degrees and you leave it in for 30 to
00:33:20,00:33:22,40 minutes.
00:33:22,00:33:23,And then it's done.
00:33:23,00:33:24,Question.
00:33:24,00:33:25,Yeah.
00:33:25,00:33:27,Because there are two ways of cooking eggs in water.
00:33:27,00:33:29,Shell on and shell off.
00:33:29,00:33:32,"So are we, are we poaching this bear boy or are we?"
00:33:32,00:33:34,"This is, I believe it's shell on, I think."
00:33:34,00:33:35,"Oh, fine."
00:33:35,00:33:36,Shell on.
00:33:36,00:33:37,Wow.
00:33:37,00:33:38,There you go.
00:33:38,00:33:39,The audience has spoken shell on.
00:33:39,00:33:40,But shell on.
00:33:40,00:33:41,In it.
00:33:41,00:33:42,It can be in a bath.
00:33:42,00:33:45,"It's not just a water bath, like a battery, it's an actual Onsen."
00:33:45,00:33:46,Yeah.
00:33:46,00:33:50,But also the eggs have a unique silky custard texture.
00:33:50,00:33:51,I bet they do.
00:33:51,00:33:52,Yeah.
00:33:52,00:33:53,I would eat that.
00:33:53,00:33:54,I'm sorry.
00:33:54,00:33:56,"Can I just ask the person, was it a lady in the audience who said, ""Chelon, have you"
00:33:56,00:33:57,"had one of these?"""
00:33:57,00:33:58,They're really good.
00:33:58,00:33:59,They're really good.
00:33:59,00:34:00,There you go.
00:34:00,00:34:01,Can't you?
00:34:01,00:34:02,Like a poached egg.
00:34:02,00:34:04,There's that like bit of white that never gets cooked and it's someone's like flamed
00:34:04,00:34:05,on your plate.
00:34:05,00:34:06,"Oh, yeah."
00:34:06,00:34:07,"Yeah, yeah."
00:34:07,00:34:09,It looks like a dementor in the in the water as it's boiling.
00:34:09,00:34:11,I've never seen a poached egg that hasn't got it.
00:34:11,00:34:12,Why do we put order this?
00:34:12,00:34:13,It's foul.
00:34:13,00:34:14,"Oh, I love a poached egg."
00:34:14,00:34:15,You do.
00:34:15,00:34:16,Yeah.
00:34:16,00:34:19,"But they're just like, if it's in its wrapper, I don't mind where it's been."
00:34:19,00:34:20,It's wrapped.
00:34:20,00:34:25,"I'd have a, I'd have a, if there was a banana, a banana in at the same time, pop that in"
00:34:25,00:34:26,the net.
00:34:26,00:34:27,I don't mind.
00:34:27,00:34:28,Yeah.
00:34:28,00:34:30,"Because it's been up her, up her chicken's bum, hasn't it?"
00:34:30,00:34:31,You're right.
00:34:31,00:34:32,Let's not get fussy.
00:34:32,00:34:33,You know.
00:34:33,00:34:35,"I wish I hadn't brought it up, I'll be honest."
00:34:35,00:34:36,It's good.
00:34:36,00:34:38,But I just want the other weird sparking.
00:34:38,00:34:42,"There was that bullseemon hair treatment, right?"
00:34:42,00:34:43,Okay.
00:34:43,00:34:45,I don't need about this in Chelsea.
00:34:45,00:34:46,No?
00:34:46,00:34:47,In Chelsea?
00:34:47,00:34:48,Yeah.
00:34:48,00:34:49,Okay.
00:34:49,00:34:52,"It was a hair mask, basically, in like 2008, 2009."
00:34:52,00:34:53,Hair mask?
00:34:53,00:34:54,Yeah.
00:34:54,00:35:00,"It was this place called Harry's Salon in Chelsea, and it offered a 45-minute Aberdeen organic"
00:35:00,00:35:10,"hair treatment, which was Aberdeen Angus, like good quality, bull come stuff, which women"
00:35:10,00:35:15,"would like, I don't know, I guess, would pay like a lot of money to have, like, lathered over"
00:35:15,00:35:16,their hair.
00:35:16,00:35:17,Yep.
00:35:17,00:35:20,"And would just like sit with it for 45 minutes, and apparently it was amazing."
00:35:20,00:35:21,Really?
00:35:21,00:35:22,"And it made their hair silky and smooth, and..."
00:35:22,00:35:26,"But I have made head-in shoulders two in one shampoo and conditioner, and that makes"
00:35:26,00:35:27,my hair silky and smooth.
00:35:27,00:35:31,"Andy, are there levels of silkeness and smoothness that I've not matched yet?"
00:35:31,00:35:32,You haven't lived.
00:35:32,00:35:35,I can imagine one of these women from Chelsea going into the countryside afterwards
00:35:35,00:35:39,"and walking through a field, and all the female cows are like, ""Do you smell something?"""
00:35:39,00:35:40,Yeah.
00:35:40,00:35:49,"Well, it's funny to say that, because the people that ran this salon told the Metro a new"
00:35:49,00:35:51,"story, these pervert fraudsters, yeah, it's gone."
00:35:51,00:35:57,These quacks said to the Metro that the seamen is refrigerated before use and doesn't smell.
00:35:57,00:36:00,"I mean, it is come, but it's not, you know..."
00:36:00,00:36:02,It's not going to stay refrigerated.
00:36:02,00:36:03,That's the problem.
00:36:03,00:36:05,The body heat is going to cause that to warm up.
00:36:05,00:36:07,"Yeah, but it's 45 minutes a minute."
00:36:07,00:36:11,"Look at, like, eating an egg from a buffoon of people, like, what do you mean?"
00:36:11,00:36:12,Look at all.
00:36:12,00:36:14,"We do need to move on to our next factory, do we?"
00:36:14,00:36:15,No!
00:36:15,00:36:16,"Yeah, but we ran again."
00:36:16,00:36:17,We didn't even touch...
00:36:17,00:36:21,I've got the dreams of engineering stuff about how the Fukushima reactor dealt with its
00:36:21,00:36:23,water after the terrible incident there.
00:36:23,00:36:24,"But I'll save it, I'll save it."
00:36:24,00:36:25,You save it.
00:36:25,00:36:26,It's fascinating.
00:36:26,00:36:27,They built an underground wall with the ice.
00:36:27,00:36:28,"Oh, he's going for it."
00:36:28,00:36:29,He's moving on.
00:36:35,00:36:37,"OK, we do need to move on."
00:36:37,00:36:39,So it is time for fact number three.
00:36:39,00:36:40,And that is...
00:36:40,00:36:41,"Oh, it's Andy."
00:36:41,00:36:50,"So, after the terrible incident at Fukushima, the engineers there pulled off a miracle, a miracle"
00:36:50,00:36:52,of preventing the radioactive.
00:36:52,00:36:53,So they've got...
00:36:53,00:36:56,Imagine a 1.5 kilometer radio circle.
00:36:56,00:36:57,Oh!
00:36:57,00:37:00,30 meters underground filled with frozen brine.
00:37:00,00:37:01,Get off your phone!
00:37:01,00:37:02,Come on!
00:37:02,00:37:04,Help your phone!
00:37:04,00:37:06,I can't start against shock of its 2 seconds.
00:37:06,00:37:07,OK.
00:37:07,00:37:08,Anyway.
00:37:08,00:37:09,Sorry.
00:37:09,00:37:15,"My fact is, the first named man who sent a letter bomb only invented it to get back at people"
00:37:15,00:37:19,who had rejected all his other ideas for inventions.
00:37:19,00:37:20,So...
00:37:20,00:37:21,This is...
00:37:21,00:37:22,Very funny.
00:37:22,00:37:24,I love this guy.
00:37:24,00:37:25,He's a very interesting historical figure.
00:37:25,00:37:30,"His name was Martin Eckenberg, and I was on the website of the Clapham Society, which"
00:37:30,00:37:32,"is a great website, all about Clapham, which is a part of South London where I used"
00:37:32,00:37:33,to live.
00:37:33,00:37:38,"He was a Swedish scientist, Martin Eckenberg, born in 1870."
00:37:38,00:37:43,"He was kind of, he was gifted inventor in some ways."
00:37:43,00:37:48,"His ideas were decent, but the other problem that he had, personally, was that he was a liar,"
00:37:48,00:37:49,he was a cheat.
00:37:49,00:37:52,He claimed qualifications he didn't have.
00:37:52,00:37:56,"He'd been kicked out of Sweden's Royal Institute of Technology, specifically for cheating."
00:37:56,00:37:57,He was a badden.
00:37:57,00:37:58,He was a badden.
00:37:58,00:37:59,He was a badden.
00:37:59,00:38:00,Fucking legend.
00:38:00,00:38:01,So...
00:38:01,00:38:02,Free thinker.
00:38:02,00:38:05,"Outside the box, kind of a liar."
00:38:05,00:38:08,"But still, this didn't hold him back that much, because he moved to one of the nicest houses"
00:38:08,00:38:09,in Clapham.
00:38:09,00:38:12,It was this really beautiful mansion he moved to.
00:38:12,00:38:14,That's not the point of the fact.
00:38:14,00:38:18,"It's been replaced by flats now, so you can't go and visit it, but if you would, that's"
00:38:18,00:38:20,"weird, and you should be on a terror list."
00:38:20,00:38:24,"And then in 1905, if you thought, right, I'm going to get revenge on everyone who's turned"
00:38:24,00:38:27,"down my ideas along the way, who turned me down for finance."
00:38:27,00:38:30,"I am going to get back at you, and he's so basically created, started making his own"
00:38:30,00:38:34,"letter bombs, and there were packages sent through the post to harm people before, but I think"
00:38:34,00:38:37,"he's the first name sort of, you know, like, prosecuted."
00:38:37,00:38:38,I think it was a bit unfair.
00:38:38,00:38:44,"So like the first person that he really sent it to was a guy called London, who ran this"
00:38:44,00:38:45,company.
00:38:45,00:38:49,"It was like an engineering company, and Eckenberg had invented something that could turn"
00:38:49,00:38:55,"fish oil into engine oil, and he thought it was going to make his millions, but it failed."
00:38:55,00:38:57,"And so he thought, well, I'm going to get this guy, London."
00:38:57,00:39:01,So the reason it failed is because the oil still smelled a fish.
00:39:01,00:39:05,"So like if people put it in the cars, the cars smelled a fish."
00:39:05,00:39:06,Right.
00:39:06,00:39:09,"I suppose if people are harries and get that sent removed, like the bullseamon."
00:39:09,00:39:13,"Well, no, the ships that was going to be used on ships, which have fish, obviously."
00:39:13,00:39:14,That's true.
00:39:14,00:39:15,"Heads of the phrase, fish and ships."
00:39:15,00:39:18,"But yeah, that."
00:39:18,00:39:23,"And then this guy, London, opens the packet, and it said, I read an article in the newspaper"
00:39:23,00:39:29,"that said, ""It rumbled and shook like thunder."" The director felt as if he had been hit by lightning"
00:39:29,00:39:31,or tickled by lightning.
00:39:31,00:39:36,"An intense flame burst out the box and burned his hands, arms, chest and face terribly."
00:39:36,00:39:37,And his clothes went on fire.
00:39:37,00:39:42,"And the next day he got a postcard saying, ""A former employee has decided that you're ripe"
00:39:42,00:39:43,"for the picking."""
00:39:43,00:39:44,Yes.
00:39:44,00:39:47,"What's interesting is that it's not as if he sent it from the post in the UK, which would"
00:39:47,00:39:49,be more traceable.
00:39:49,00:39:54,"He went by boat, back to Sweden, he assembled it there, sent it there and then went back home."
00:39:54,00:39:55,So he really covered up his tracks.
00:39:55,00:40:00,But then he still set a postcard with his writing identifiable on it to the person he'd
00:40:00,00:40:01,just...
00:40:01,00:40:02,Yeah.
00:40:02,00:40:05,"I mean, he was caught for various quite stupid things like that."
00:40:05,00:40:06,Yeah.
00:40:06,00:40:09,Can I just rescind that I thought he was good?
00:40:09,00:40:10,"No, no."
00:40:10,00:40:13,"There's another thing as well, James, see if you still think he's good."
00:40:13,00:40:18,"So when he was arrested, he claimed innocence, and then he, according to the New York Times,"
00:40:18,00:40:21,he lost his reason and was taken to an asylum.
00:40:21,00:40:27,"He died two months later, after his arrest, of what they said was apoplexy."
00:40:27,00:40:32,"But the head of the Swedish detective service said that if he'd been sent back to Sweden,"
00:40:32,00:40:35,he would have also been tried for murdering his two wives.
00:40:35,00:40:36,Oh.
00:40:36,00:40:37,Right.
00:40:37,00:40:38,Yeah.
00:40:38,00:40:39,No.
00:40:39,00:40:40,Are you feeling sorry about that?
00:40:40,00:40:42,Let's get a live reaction from Jamie Morden sitting right here.
00:40:42,00:40:43,Sounds fine.
00:40:43,00:40:44,Yeah.
00:40:44,00:40:45,Not too sure.
00:40:45,00:40:50,"What appears to have happened is he poisoned his first two wives, and then he bribed the"
00:40:50,00:40:54,prison guards to get him the same poison which he then took himself.
00:40:54,00:40:55,Yeah.
00:40:55,00:40:56,Yeah.
00:40:56,00:41:01,"And interestingly today, if you go to the police museum and stock home, there's a giant wax"
00:41:01,00:41:07,"work, like a replica, human-sized wax replica of him standing there, and not only that, they"
00:41:07,00:41:09,have a bunch of things that were to do with the case.
00:41:09,00:41:13,"So one of the bombings, which was sent to the Swedish Export Society, was opened up by"
00:41:13,00:41:18,"a man called John Hammer, and John Hammer's thumb was blown off as part of opening the"
00:41:18,00:41:19,scene.
00:41:19,00:41:23,"And if you go to the police museum and stock home, you can see the wax work of Morden Eckenberg,"
00:41:23,00:41:26,and then you can see the actual thumb of John Hammer.
00:41:26,00:41:27,Thumbs up or thumbs down.
00:41:27,00:41:28,It's the...
00:41:28,00:41:29,Yeah.
00:41:29,00:41:30,It wasn't happy.
00:41:30,00:41:31,It's a definite thumbs down for me.
00:41:31,00:41:32,Yeah.
00:41:32,00:41:33,"So it's very, very grim guy."
00:41:33,00:41:35,But it was an innovator of sorts.
00:41:35,00:41:39,"And as I say, people had been sending devices designed to hurt other people through the"
00:41:39,00:41:41,"post for ages, you know."
00:41:41,00:41:45,So the very first one was a thing called the band box plot.
00:41:45,00:41:49,"People were very worried about the week party in the, I think, 18th century, and supposedly"
00:41:49,00:41:53,that party were involved in some attempts to assassinate people.
00:41:53,00:41:54,Get this.
00:41:54,00:41:58,"The very first ever thing sent through the post designed to harm someone, this band box plot,"
00:41:58,00:42:02,"was a box full of, I think, there's three pistols, but when you open it, they all go off"
00:42:02,00:42:03,at you.
00:42:03,00:42:04,Wow.
00:42:04,00:42:05,I know.
00:42:05,00:42:06,And it was...
00:42:06,00:42:07,"Oh, my God."
00:42:07,00:42:09,This is the story that it was thwarted by Jonathan Swift.
00:42:09,00:42:15,"Well, the author of the travels, because he was a political figure as well, and he supposedly"
00:42:15,00:42:19,noticed a thread on the box and cut it before opening it.
00:42:19,00:42:24,"Oh, so he's the first red wire blue wire cut moment that we've ever had for a bomb."
00:42:24,00:42:25,Yeah.
00:42:25,00:42:26,Pretty cool.
00:42:26,00:42:27,And we talk about his books instead.
00:42:27,00:42:28,"No, yeah."
00:42:28,00:42:32,But Eckenberg was the first of a kind of new wave where Gump Outer had been invented.
00:42:32,00:42:34,The post had improved things like that.
00:42:34,00:42:38,"And so there were anarchists, people very, very worried about anarchists with their kind"
00:42:38,00:42:40,of cartoon-style bombs that they'd be throwing.
00:42:40,00:42:41,Yeah.
00:42:41,00:42:46,"And he also invented a way to freeze dry milk, which is kind of similar to what we have today."
00:42:46,00:42:49,"So like, you know, instant custard, we wouldn't have it without him."
00:42:49,00:42:50,Really?
00:42:50,00:42:51,"Well, Eckenberg."
00:42:51,00:42:52,Wow.
00:42:52,00:42:53,"Jamie, you want to change your..."
00:42:53,00:42:56,"Because you're going off him, but I know you don't mind custard, do you know?"
00:42:56,00:42:57,You don't have a bit of custard.
00:42:57,00:42:58,"I mean, you know, I'm..."
00:42:58,00:42:59,Because of 50/50.
00:42:59,00:43:00,It requires people.
00:43:00,00:43:05,I'll tell you why I think he's not a complete villain.
00:43:05,00:43:11,"So interesting, which Hills people choose to die on."
00:43:11,00:43:12,I find that really fascinating.
00:43:12,00:43:17,"I just kind of love the fact that like through revenge he invented something that was actually,"
00:43:17,00:43:22,"I mean, not a good thing, but was like a thing."
00:43:22,00:43:25,This silver lining is slimming down all the time.
00:43:25,00:43:26,I got to say.
00:43:26,00:43:29,"So it was for revenge, but he did invent something really bad."
00:43:29,00:43:35,"Well, maybe this is how my mind works. I mean, I got quite heavily into revenge during my"
00:43:35,00:43:36,researching of this.
00:43:36,00:43:39,"So I was like, what else has revenge kind of created?"
00:43:39,00:43:44,And the rotary telephone is one thing that revenge has created.
00:43:44,00:43:45,Yeah.
00:43:45,00:43:51,"Because there was a guy called Alman Stroudger, and he was an undertaker in the late 19th century"
00:43:51,00:43:52,in Kansas City.
00:43:52,00:43:55,"They were all manual switchboards at that point, obviously."
00:43:55,00:44:02,"And he thought that the switchboard operators were deliberately fiddling with his connections,"
00:44:02,00:44:03,because--
00:44:03,00:44:07,"Wait, so you would call up and say, patch me through to this person, right?"
00:44:07,00:44:14,"And he was convinced that this was being meddled with, because the other undertakers across"
00:44:14,00:44:20,"the town, I think their wife worked at the phone company, so someone dies, you put them"
00:44:20,00:44:21,through to--
00:44:21,00:44:22,Right.
00:44:22,00:44:23,To the rival.
00:44:23,00:44:24,"And yeah, exactly."
00:44:24,00:44:25,So they were getting all the work.
00:44:25,00:44:26,So what's going on here?
00:44:26,00:44:30,And so he invented the rotary telephone to cut out the--
00:44:30,00:44:32,What's the one where you dial with it?
00:44:32,00:44:33,"Yeah, so you could dial it yourself."
00:44:33,00:44:34,That is amazing.
00:44:34,00:44:35,That's great.
00:44:35,00:44:36,It's not amazing.
00:44:36,00:44:37,Right.
00:44:37,00:44:38,Revenge.
00:44:38,00:44:39,But not all bad.
00:44:39,00:44:40,Okay.
00:44:40,00:44:41,It's like those spite houses.
00:44:41,00:44:42,"You know, spite houses."
00:44:42,00:44:46,And it's just so cool that something that you build to screw someone over ends up being
00:44:46,00:44:47,worth more than the house that--
00:44:47,00:44:48,"Yeah, exactly."
00:44:48,00:44:49,"Yeah, exactly."
00:44:49,00:44:50,I just love stuff like that.
00:44:50,00:44:55,"Just jumping back to Letterbombs for a second, I've discovered that the former prime minister--"
00:44:55,00:44:59,"well, a very long former prime minister, Anthony Eden."
00:44:59,00:45:02,"So prime minister of England, he was almost killed by Letterbombs."
00:45:02,00:45:03,Is that so?
00:45:03,00:45:04,Yeah.
00:45:04,00:45:05,And this was prior to him being prime minister.
00:45:05,00:45:12,"It was when he was foreign secretary, and someone had hand-delivered a Letterbombs."
00:45:12,00:45:15,"He took it, but he thought, ah, this looks a bit boring."
00:45:15,00:45:19,"So he put it in his briefcase, and he had it for 24 hours."
00:45:19,00:45:20,He went home.
00:45:20,00:45:21,He didn't open it.
00:45:21,00:45:23,He just had a whole day of not opening it.
00:45:23,00:45:24,And then Scotland got--
00:45:24,00:45:25,A letter looked boring.
00:45:25,00:45:27,"Yeah, he thought it looked like a circular, like it looked like something that might have been"
00:45:27,00:45:28,dropped off.
00:45:28,00:45:29,"Oh, yeah."
00:45:29,00:45:30,And it was a generic thing.
00:45:30,00:45:31,Yeah.
00:45:31,00:45:35,"And so then Scotland Yard got in contact and said, we're worried that something might have"
00:45:35,00:45:36,been sent to you that is a bomb.
00:45:36,00:45:38,And he still didn't look at it.
00:45:38,00:45:42,"And it was his secretary who eventually went, that might be a bomb, and then--"
00:45:42,00:45:43,And it was.
00:45:43,00:45:47,And so it was just purely his absolute boredom towards this letter that--
00:45:47,00:45:51,Because that was an interesting letter he ever received.
00:45:51,00:45:55,"And that's the thing is, they're designed to go off when you open them, aren't they?"
00:45:55,00:45:56,So you can carry them around.
00:45:56,00:45:57,Yeah.
00:45:57,00:45:58,And it's fine.
00:45:58,00:46:03,"So, for instance, you're told that if you work in a government office and they might"
00:46:03,00:46:06,"happen, a lot of people, when they get a letter that they're not sure about, they put"
00:46:06,00:46:07,it in water.
00:46:07,00:46:10,"Because they think that's what you're supposed to do with a bomb, but you're absolutely not"
00:46:10,00:46:11,supposed to put it in water.
00:46:11,00:46:14,Because some of the explosives will explode if you put them in a big--
00:46:14,00:46:15,Is that so?
00:46:15,00:46:18,I also renders the letter completely illegible.
00:46:18,00:46:19,Exactly.
00:46:19,00:46:21,I've got stupid idea.
00:46:21,00:46:22,There are some tips.
00:46:22,00:46:23,"There are some useful tips, actually."
00:46:23,00:46:29,"So warning signs include, excess postage."
00:46:29,00:46:31,"Like, why is someone spending so much money on their parcel?"
00:46:31,00:46:34,"Because you don't want to risk it getting returned to you, do you?"
00:46:34,00:46:37,Right.
00:46:37,00:46:39,No return address.
00:46:39,00:46:42,So the really clever bombers will leave the return address off.
00:46:42,00:46:47,I think I would put the return address as my number two nemesis.
00:46:47,00:46:48,"Yeah, nice."
00:46:48,00:46:49,Such a good idea.
00:46:49,00:46:50,Yeah.
00:46:50,00:46:52,Such a good idea.
00:46:52,00:46:53,Number two.
00:46:53,00:46:55,What have you got?
00:46:55,00:46:56,It's a long old list.
00:46:56,00:46:57,He's doing this.
00:46:57,00:46:58,He's doing this.
00:46:58,00:46:59,Bad spelling.
00:46:59,00:47:00,Oh.
00:47:00,00:47:02,"Because a lot of-- I mean, a lot of people sending these things are not the-- maybe."
00:47:02,00:47:04,"I'm going to say, like, off letter bombs."
00:47:04,00:47:06,They're not the brightest buttons.
00:47:06,00:47:07,Really?
00:47:07,00:47:08,"Yeah, bad spelling."
00:47:08,00:47:10,Because they've just constructed a bomb.
00:47:10,00:47:12,It feels like you've got a basic--
00:47:12,00:47:13,Get one.
00:47:13,00:47:13,What are you doing?
00:47:13,00:47:17,They might have studied the sciences and not the humanities.
00:47:17,00:47:18,"Yes, that's the point."
00:47:18,00:47:20,There are so many kinds of intelligence.
00:47:20,00:47:26,"Addressed personal, confidential, or do not x-ray."
00:47:26,00:47:31,That's wrong.
00:47:31,00:47:34,"And the final one, just for any of that have slipped through those many holes"
00:47:34,00:47:40,"in the Swiss cheese, ticking sounds, protruding wires."
00:47:40,00:47:41,"OK, yeah."
00:47:41,00:47:42,Or aluminium foil.
00:47:42,00:47:44,"Or if it says ""acme bomb"" on the front."
00:47:44,00:47:50,"If it's dropped off by a coyote who looks pleased with himself, that's another one."
00:47:50,00:47:51,I did read.
00:47:51,00:47:54,"There was a-- what's the name of the journalist, Slasov Zizek?"
00:47:54,00:47:55,Slasov Zizek.
00:47:55,00:47:58,"Yeah, so he wrote this piece."
00:47:58,00:48:01,And the opening anecdote of the piece at the top winner in the contest
00:48:01,00:48:05,for the greatest blunder of 1998 was a Latin American patriotic terrorist
00:48:05,00:48:09,who sent a letter bomb to a US consulate in order to protest against America
00:48:09,00:48:11,interfering local politics.
00:48:11,00:48:14,"As a conscientious citizen, he wrote his return address on the envelope."
00:48:14,00:48:17,"However, he did not put enough stamps on it."
00:48:17,00:48:19,"So that post was returned to him, forgetting he'd put it in."
00:48:19,00:48:21,He opened it and blew himself up.
00:48:21,00:48:22,"He did, and he did what James said."
00:48:22,00:48:23,Yeah.
00:48:23,00:48:26,"Now, who knows if that's apocryphal, but it's--"
00:48:26,00:48:26,What's his name?
00:48:26,00:48:28,"All the fingerprints of Jack Waz, anyway, near this."
00:48:28,00:48:35,"I'll tell you what, that's the first time Jack Waz and Slasov Zizek"
00:48:35,00:48:37,have been mentioned in the same sentence together.
00:48:38,00:48:41,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:48:41,00:48:48,"It is time for our final fact of the show, and that is James."
00:48:48,00:48:52,"OK, my fact this week is that there is currently a scandal in Thailand"
00:48:52,00:48:56,after at least a dozen supposedly celibate monks
00:48:56,00:49:00,admitted to having sex with a woman called Mrs. Golf.
00:49:00,00:49:04,"James, you're a keen golfer."
00:49:04,00:49:05,That's how I found this.
00:49:05,00:49:07,I was googling gol.
00:49:07,00:49:10,"No, no, no."
00:49:10,00:49:14,"No, I just read this in the news, and I thought it's very amusing."
00:49:14,00:49:16,It is a lot of senior monks.
00:49:16,00:49:18,"I mean, not amusing, if you're a monk,"
00:49:18,00:49:21,"because obviously a lot of them have lost their livelihoods,"
00:49:21,00:49:24,"including some as high ranking as frat dep,"
00:49:24,00:49:26,which means angelic level.
00:49:26,00:49:29,"So this goes to the very, very top."
00:49:29,00:49:31,And it turns out they've been having relationships
00:49:31,00:49:33,"with this woman, who's called Mrs. Golf,"
00:49:33,00:49:36,and they've been transferring money to her.
00:49:36,00:49:39,"And they've found this lady, and they've found"
00:49:39,00:49:43,"over 80,000 photos of naked monks on her phone."
00:49:43,00:49:45,How do they know they're monks?
00:49:45,00:49:47,[LAUGHTER]
00:49:47,00:49:48,Sorry to quibble.
00:49:48,00:49:51,I reckon there's a way.
00:49:51,00:49:52,You reckon there's a way?
00:49:52,00:49:52,It's probably a way.
00:49:52,00:49:53,I reckon there's a way.
00:49:53,00:49:55,Probably it's the hair style down there.
00:49:55,00:49:56,It's like a tontia.
00:49:56,00:49:59,It's like a tontia.
00:49:59,00:50:00,"80,000 is a lot."
00:50:00,00:50:02,Not necessarily all different monks.
00:50:02,00:50:04,They could have been--
00:50:04,00:50:06,I don't even know if I have that amount of storage on my phone
00:50:06,00:50:07,"for 80,000 photos."
00:50:07,00:50:08,"Yes, what was her data plan like?"
00:50:08,00:50:10,This is really interesting.
00:50:10,00:50:11,Is she in the cloud?
00:50:11,00:50:13,She's using the cloud.
00:50:13,00:50:15,"So yeah, and the reason she's called Mrs. Golf"
00:50:15,00:50:18,is because this is like common in Thailand
00:50:18,00:50:21,for people to have little short nicknames.
00:50:21,00:50:24,And you're kind of given them as a child by your parents.
00:50:24,00:50:26,And they don't really mean anything.
00:50:26,00:50:28,"It might be that this person's parents love golf,"
00:50:28,00:50:33,"but more likely, they just take a Western word that kind"
00:50:33,00:50:35,of sounds fun or trendy or whatever.
00:50:35,00:50:36,And they just call that.
00:50:36,00:50:39,The most famous Thai person in the world probably
00:50:39,00:50:40,is Lisa from Blackpink.
00:50:40,00:50:42,And her nickname is Pockpack.
00:50:42,00:50:46,"Lisa from Blackpink, the band."
00:50:46,00:50:47,So it's just like--
00:50:47,00:50:50,[LAUGHTER]
00:50:50,00:50:52,"James, earlier in the show, I thought Taylor Swift"
00:50:52,00:50:54,was getting married to Kelsey Grammar.
00:50:54,00:50:58,So let's just modulate--
00:50:58,00:51:00,"like, what we think I'm going to know."
00:51:00,00:51:04,So they're just--
00:51:04,00:51:06,"mostly just sounds, or they might be little words"
00:51:06,00:51:09,"from other languages, but it's just like a little nickname."
00:51:09,00:51:10,But people go by it in real life.
00:51:10,00:51:13,"Like, as adults, you might still be known as that nickname."
00:51:13,00:51:14,Yeah.
00:51:14,00:51:17,But so this is an unbelievably fascinating story.
00:51:17,00:51:22,This one woman went around so many of these different monasteries
00:51:22,00:51:24,and managed to talk in what were effectively--
00:51:24,00:51:26,"I'm assuming, celibate monks--"
00:51:26,00:51:30,"into engaging, not only in sex, but also having photos taken."
00:51:30,00:51:33,"And the top monks, some of them, have fled the country."
00:51:33,00:51:34,We don't know quite where they are.
00:51:34,00:51:36,And they haven't said why they've done that.
00:51:36,00:51:40,"They're now investigating 300,000 other Buddhist monks"
00:51:40,00:51:43,in Thailand off the back of this to see whether or not
00:51:43,00:51:43,they're involved.
00:51:43,00:51:46,And she got a lot of money off the back of this.
00:51:46,00:51:48,Was her own extortion?
00:51:48,00:51:49,"Sort of, I'll release the photos."
00:51:49,00:51:51,"So the photos would be shown back to them,"
00:51:51,00:51:52,and then they would have to pay money.
00:51:52,00:51:54,And a lot of the monks have been acquitted
00:51:54,00:51:57,where the police have decided that actually you just
00:51:57,00:51:59,gave her money because she was pleading for the money
00:51:59,00:52:02,and didn't engage in sexual activity.
00:52:02,00:52:02,And trust me.
00:52:02,00:52:04,"But you know how much money, allegedly,"
00:52:04,00:52:11,she has netted the equivalent of $11.9 million from this.
00:52:11,00:52:12,"There's a lot of money in munking, isn't there?"
00:52:12,00:52:14,Isn't there?
00:52:14,00:52:16,"Yeah, that's a bigger career than I thought."
00:52:16,00:52:20,"Like, no, my career advisor did not say,"
00:52:20,00:52:22,have you considered becoming a monk?
00:52:22,00:52:23,And I think it's quite a big deal.
00:52:23,00:52:26,"In Thailand, because if you're a Buddhist,"
00:52:26,00:52:28,"you think that if someone becomes a monk,"
00:52:28,00:52:30,then they kind of automatically sort of
00:52:30,00:52:34,develop this strong resistance to temptation
00:52:34,00:52:35,and that kind of thing.
00:52:35,00:52:37,And so to find out that they haven't
00:52:37,00:52:39,was quite a big deal for a lot of people.
00:52:39,00:52:39,Yeah.
00:52:39,00:52:41,"I think this is very interesting, because I"
00:52:41,00:52:44,"started reading about, by the way, James,"
00:52:44,00:52:46,"there's a very hard factor, Google, like naughty monks."
00:52:46,00:52:50,And naughty nuns is actually even worse.
00:52:50,00:52:53,It's an even harder legit Google.
00:52:53,00:52:56,"But basically, there was a lot of this in the 16th century"
00:52:56,00:53:01,"in England, because monks and nuns and monasteries and nunneries"
00:53:01,00:53:03,were seen as hoppets of sin.
00:53:03,00:53:05,And the idea was they're all on the take.
00:53:05,00:53:09,"They're all selling, pardoning for sins, that kind of thing."
00:53:09,00:53:11,"Like, they're all, and they're all shacking up."
00:53:11,00:53:12,And there were some institutions--
00:53:12,00:53:14,Cancer Reformation.
00:53:14,00:53:15,"Cancer Reformation, right."
00:53:15,00:53:17,But I think we've all been conned into thinking
00:53:17,00:53:20,"that monks and nuns are inherently sort of naughty figures,"
00:53:20,00:53:22,because they're absolutely not.
00:53:22,00:53:25,And I think we fall off a Henry VIII era propaganda.
00:53:25,00:53:26,And I'm blowing the lid off this.
00:53:26,00:53:30,"Not enough people talk about it, but I'm not afraid to."
00:53:30,00:53:33,"I'd just like to reference the paper by Christian Knudsen,"
00:53:33,00:53:35,"Sodomitic monks and other dissolution myths,"
00:53:35,00:53:38,the late medieval monastic decline narrative revisited.
00:53:38,00:53:39,And it is a belting read.
00:53:39,00:53:41,It's really good.
00:53:41,00:53:43,And it's-- can you tell us more about the Fukushima
00:53:43,00:53:43,disaster?
00:53:50,00:53:53,"But like, Henry VIII wanted to dissolve the monasteries."
00:53:53,00:53:57,Because they owned a huge proportion of English land.
00:53:57,00:53:58,There was so wealthy.
00:53:58,00:54:00,And Henry VIII thought I'm going to discredit
00:54:00,00:54:03,ecclesiastical institutions any way I can.
00:54:03,00:54:06,"And every monastery in England, in 1535 and '65,"
00:54:06,00:54:09,got a visit from bureaucrats who were trying to record
00:54:09,00:54:12,every dubious incidence of behavior by a monk or a nun
00:54:12,00:54:13,they could.
00:54:13,00:54:15,And there were some cases--
00:54:15,00:54:16,"absolutely, there were some cases"
00:54:16,00:54:18,where monks had been playing the field or whatever it is.
00:54:18,00:54:21,But they also-- they had to come up with new crimes.
00:54:21,00:54:22,So they found dozens of instances
00:54:22,00:54:25,"recorded of voluntary pollution, which"
00:54:25,00:54:26,is just sort of playing with yourself.
00:54:26,00:54:31,"But it's not-- in one priori, West Acres, 76% of the monks"
00:54:31,00:54:33,were labeled incontinent by which they mean
00:54:33,00:54:36,romantically incontinent.
00:54:36,00:54:38,But 10 of those 13 were for just enjoying
00:54:38,00:54:40,some sort of cowl billiards.
00:54:40,00:54:43,"And so it's not cow-- the cow goes in your head, doesn't it?"
00:54:43,00:54:45,You know what I mean?
00:54:45,00:54:45,Hardly ever.
00:54:45,00:54:49,[LAUGHTER]
00:54:49,00:54:50,I just think it's really interesting.
00:54:50,00:54:52,And I think we shouldn't fall for it.
00:54:52,00:54:53,"OK, well, we won't."
00:54:53,00:54:56,[LAUGHTER]
00:54:56,00:54:58,"But also, I'm a Catholic."
00:54:58,00:54:59,"I mean, you know, lapsed Catholic."
00:54:59,00:55:01,"Like, you can do anything if you say sorry."
00:55:01,00:55:02,That's like the point.
00:55:02,00:55:03,Yes.
00:55:03,00:55:04,But actually--
00:55:04,00:55:07,"The penance was quite severe, where it could be."
00:55:07,00:55:11,"So Richard Gray, one man called Richard Gray in Medieval England,"
00:55:11,00:55:13,he was found guilty of having sex with a nun.
00:55:13,00:55:16,And he was sentenced to being flogged while walking
00:55:16,00:55:19,"around Stanford Church on four Sundays in a row,"
00:55:19,00:55:23,carrying a candle while dressed only in linen garments.
00:55:23,00:55:25,And then he had to make a barefoot pilgrimage
00:55:25,00:55:28,"to Lincoln Cathedral, from where?"
00:55:28,00:55:31,Wherever he lived.
00:55:31,00:55:34,"Wow, that's a movable feast of a punishment, isn't it?"
00:55:34,00:55:35,I just want to feed you all right.
00:55:35,00:55:37,I'm going to get a flat just outside Lincoln.
00:55:37,00:55:40,[LAUGHTER]
00:55:40,00:55:43,"Yeah, that was quite a mess for me to not say"
00:55:43,00:55:45,where he actually lived in my notes.
00:55:45,00:55:47,But then--
00:55:47,00:55:50,"And then after that, he didn't do what he was supposed to do,"
00:55:50,00:55:52,and they've excommunicated him.
00:55:52,00:55:53,"But in those days, being excommunicated"
00:55:53,00:55:54,"was a big, old deal."
00:55:54,00:55:55,Right.
00:55:55,00:55:57,"Because it means you can't go to heaven,"
00:55:57,00:55:59,but also means you can't be baptized.
00:55:59,00:56:00,Means you can't get married.
00:56:00,00:56:03,You can't do all sorts of different things.
00:56:03,00:56:04,"Yeah, and actually, quite often,"
00:56:04,00:56:06,the women were punished more than the men.
00:56:06,00:56:09,"So two that happened quite close to each other,"
00:56:09,00:56:12,"a guy called Nicholas Plymouth, was a monk who"
00:56:12,00:56:15,has committed adultery with a Tanner's wife.
00:56:15,00:56:19,And he was ordered to remain silent for one week.
00:56:19,00:56:20,"And around the same time, someone"
00:56:20,00:56:22,called Alice Longspray was sentenced
00:56:22,00:56:26,to a year of strict confinement after an affair
00:56:26,00:56:26,with a priest.
00:56:26,00:56:27,It's double standards.
00:56:27,00:56:29,"So it is double standards, yeah."
00:56:29,00:56:29,Yeah.
00:56:29,00:56:32,"James, you've spent time in Bhutan."
00:56:32,00:56:32,I have.
00:56:32,00:56:35,Did you ever hear of the thunderbolt of flaming wisdom
00:56:35,00:56:36,while you were out there?
00:56:36,00:56:38,"That's what they still call me, then."
00:56:38,00:56:41,[LAUGHTER]
00:56:41,00:56:43,I wonder when the thunderbolt of flaming wisdom
00:56:43,00:56:46,is going to return.
00:56:46,00:56:51,"So it's referring to amongst penis,"
00:56:51,00:56:51,but--
00:56:51,00:56:56,[LAUGHTER]
00:56:56,00:57:00,So a question who your real friends were out there.
00:57:00,00:57:04,But it was strange that they yelled at me at the streets.
00:57:04,00:57:06,[LAUGHTER]
00:57:06,00:57:07,Is that right?
00:57:07,00:57:11,"There was this guy, Druckper Cunley, and he was in the 1400s."
00:57:11,00:57:12,"Yeah, I'd been to his church."
00:57:12,00:57:13,You've been to his church.
00:57:13,00:57:15,"So he was interesting, because he"
00:57:15,00:57:18,"was known as the Saint of 5,000 women."
00:57:18,00:57:20,He was a fertility saint.
00:57:20,00:57:21,The idea was he thought sex should
00:57:21,00:57:24,be incorporated into reaching enlightenment.
00:57:24,00:57:25,And so--
00:57:25,00:57:25,"Oh, right."
00:57:25,00:57:27,So classic.
00:57:27,00:57:27,"Oh, yeah."
00:57:27,00:57:30,"Yeah, you would meet the thunderbolt of flaming wisdom"
00:57:30,00:57:33,"as part of your hello to him, basically."
00:57:33,00:57:37,"And he was liked, but mad as fuck."
00:57:37,00:57:39,"Like, people genuinely thought he was."
00:57:39,00:57:40,And what I--
00:57:40,00:57:42,It's known as like the Holy Mad Man or something like that.
00:57:42,00:57:42,Yeah.
00:57:42,00:57:44,"And he introduced this idea, which still"
00:57:44,00:57:46,"goes on in various bits of Bhutan today,"
00:57:46,00:57:48,which is that if you're setting up a new house
00:57:48,00:57:51,"and you need it to be blessed, you would basically"
00:57:51,00:57:54,"graffiti, fallists, put dig picks, all over--"
00:57:54,00:57:56,"like draw a penis, all over the walls."
00:57:56,00:57:57,Did you see any--
00:57:57,00:58:00,"Well, yeah, yeah, they're on every house, has them."
00:58:00,00:58:00,Yeah.
00:58:00,00:58:02,In this particular town where he was from.
00:58:02,00:58:05,"And also, if you go into his church,"
00:58:05,00:58:07,priest comes up to you with a giant fallace
00:58:07,00:58:09,and sort of touches you as if you'd
00:58:09,00:58:11,been knighted by the queen.
00:58:11,00:58:12,Rise.
00:58:12,00:58:13,Did you have that?
00:58:13,00:58:13,Yeah.
00:58:13,00:58:14,Wow.
00:58:14,00:58:14,Cool.
00:58:14,00:58:15,Arise.
00:58:15,00:58:20,"If it's on every house, can you put it on a semi?"
00:58:20,00:58:21,Sorry.
00:58:21,00:58:21,Go on.
00:58:21,00:58:25,"Well, so it's pretty fascinating."
00:58:25,00:58:27,It sounds like modern Bhutan really
00:58:27,00:58:29,"is for the people who are less connected to that,"
00:58:29,00:58:32,slightly embarrassed by the fact that penises are everywhere.
00:58:32,00:58:35,"I'll be honest, they take every tourist there."
00:58:35,00:58:35,"Right, OK."
00:58:35,00:58:38,"Because it is, like, it's Instagram central, you know,"
00:58:38,00:58:40,like lots of houses with penises on them.
00:58:40,00:58:41,"Yeah, interesting."
00:58:41,00:58:42,Yeah.
00:58:42,00:58:44,But I did also play golf with my monks.
00:58:44,00:58:47,"So I say my monks, like, the monks take you around"
00:58:47,00:58:48,the same time.
00:58:48,00:58:49,You're not allowed to just walk around.
00:58:49,00:58:51,They give you a couple of monks who kind of take you
00:58:51,00:58:52,everywhere.
00:58:52,00:58:53,And I asked if I could play golf.
00:58:53,00:58:55,"And apparently, no one really asked that."
00:58:55,00:58:56,"But I was in the Himalayas, so they"
00:58:56,00:59:00,"has really thin, so the ball goes miles."
00:59:00,00:59:01,"Oh, but if you get it wrong."
00:59:01,00:59:02,Surely.
00:59:02,00:59:03,Yeah.
00:59:03,00:59:04,"And also today, I've learned that I"
00:59:04,00:59:08,got a very high dose of radiation that day.
00:59:08,00:59:11,"And then I did karaoke with them, as well, with the monks."
00:59:11,00:59:14,"Like, all the monks came together in a bar in the evening."
00:59:14,00:59:15,And they went with them.
00:59:15,00:59:16,And we-- and sang karaoke.
00:59:16,00:59:18,What was that go-to song?
00:59:18,00:59:19,"Come on, come on."
00:59:19,00:59:22,"I sang it in Bhutanese, so I didn't really understand it."
00:59:22,00:59:23,What did they sing?
00:59:23,00:59:25,They were all the songs were in Bhutanese.
00:59:25,00:59:25,I will survive.
00:59:25,00:59:26,Got to be I will survive.
00:59:26,00:59:27,Yeah.
00:59:27,00:59:28,Yeah.
00:59:28,00:59:30,Do you want to know something cool about the first century
00:59:30,00:59:31,St. Thecla?
00:59:31,00:59:32,"Yes, please."
00:59:32,00:59:33,"Yes, please."
00:59:33,00:59:34,"This was sent in by a listener, actually."
00:59:34,00:59:35,Listen to Kat Brinker.
00:59:35,00:59:36,So thanks Kat for this.
00:59:36,00:59:39,This is the first century St. Thecla.
00:59:39,00:59:43,She is the unofficial patron saint of computers and the internet.
00:59:43,00:59:44,Can you work out why?
00:59:44,00:59:46,"It's going to be sex-connected, presumably."
00:59:46,00:59:47,Nope.
00:59:47,00:59:48,[LAUGHTER]
00:59:48,00:59:50,But you said it was to do with the internet.
00:59:50,00:59:51,"No, I know."
00:59:51,00:59:52,I know.
00:59:52,00:59:54,What did the first century monk have to do with computers
00:59:54,00:59:55,and the internet?
00:59:55,00:59:56,She liked cats.
00:59:56,00:59:58,That's a really good one.
00:59:58,00:59:59,That's very close.
00:59:59,01:00:01,She was very racist all the time.
01:00:01,01:00:02,No.
01:00:02,01:00:03,[LAUGHTER]
01:00:03,01:00:10,It's because her name Thecla sounds like the Spanish word for a key on a keyboard.
01:00:10,01:00:11,Thecla.
01:00:11,01:00:12,"Oh, OK."
01:00:12,01:00:13,Thecla.
01:00:13,01:00:14,You've not just wasted their time.
01:00:14,01:00:15,[LAUGHTER]
01:00:15,01:00:16,Unbelievable.
01:00:16,01:00:25,"If you'd like to know some other grabs of the word Thecla, I've got loads."
01:00:25,01:00:29,[MUSIC PLAYING]
01:00:29,01:00:30,We've got to wrap up.
01:00:30,01:00:31,We need to wrap up our show.
01:00:31,01:00:32,What is for the shame?
01:00:32,01:00:37,[LAUGHTER]
01:00:37,01:00:41,"However, before we wrap up tonight, so we've got one last thing to do, which is our brilliant"
01:00:41,01:00:46,giant sperm donor over there is going to come on stage.
01:00:46,01:00:47,You could have quit.
01:00:47,01:00:49,It's going to arrive on stage.
01:00:49,01:00:56,"And, James, you're going to be hosting a quiz, right?"
01:00:56,01:00:57,"Yes, I am."
01:00:57,01:00:59,"Yes, so is it James as well?"
01:00:59,01:01:00,"Come on up, James."
01:01:00,01:01:03,What we're going to do is we're going to do a little quiz and we're going to put you up
01:01:03,01:01:05,against Jamie Martin.
01:01:05,01:01:07,"How well do you know those things are fish, James?"
01:01:07,01:01:08,"Very well, yeah."
01:01:08,01:01:10,"Yes, Jamie?"
01:01:10,01:01:11,Not at all.
01:01:11,01:01:13,[LAUGHTER]
01:01:13,01:01:18,"Well, I've been on it three times, three or four times, and that's it."
01:01:18,01:01:19,OK.
01:01:19,01:01:22,"These questions will not refer to any time you were on the show, Jamie."
01:01:22,01:01:26,"But I do know you guys, so in theory, it should balance out."
01:01:26,01:01:30,"Absolutely, because the quiz is going to be things that we have mentioned about ourselves"
01:01:30,01:01:31,on the podcast.
01:01:31,01:01:36,"I'm going to say a statement that one of us has said, and it's up to you to decide which"
01:01:36,01:01:37,of us said it.
01:01:37,01:01:40,"Now, Jamie, if you don't remember our names, just point at us."
01:01:40,01:01:41,Great.
01:01:41,01:01:42,OK.
01:01:42,01:01:43,The guy in the hat.
01:01:43,01:01:44,Can I confer?
01:01:44,01:01:45,No.
01:01:45,01:01:46,Because Dan will--
01:01:46,01:01:47,No.
01:01:47,01:01:49,[LAUGHTER]
01:01:49,01:01:50,Dan knows it's so less than me.
01:01:50,01:01:54,"So what we're going to do is we're going to do three questions, because one of the questions"
01:01:54,01:01:58,I have is something that we've just mentioned on the podcast today.
01:01:58,01:01:59,So I can't do that one.
01:01:59,01:02:00,We'll do three each.
01:02:00,01:02:02,Hopefully it won't be a tie.
01:02:02,01:02:03,That's all I could say.
01:02:03,01:02:06,"So first of all, this is to you, James."
01:02:06,01:02:07,OK.
01:02:07,01:02:09,"Which of us, on those six fingers of fish, it can't be Anna."
01:02:09,01:02:11,It's going to be me and the Ordan.
01:02:11,01:02:16,"Which of us said, I slept in a church for a fortnight?"
01:02:16,01:02:16,James.
01:02:16,01:02:17,Me?
01:02:17,01:02:18,Yeah.
01:02:18,01:02:19,It was not me.
01:02:19,01:02:21,"Dan, was it you?"
01:02:21,01:02:23,I don't think so.
01:02:23,01:02:24,[LAUGHTER]
01:02:24,01:02:27,I really hope this is you and the otherwise the whole quiz has gone to shit.
01:02:27,01:02:28,"But, was it you?"
01:02:28,01:02:29,"Yeah, I think it was."
01:02:29,01:02:30,Yeah.
01:02:30,01:02:31,It was me.
01:02:31,01:02:32,It was Andy.
01:02:32,01:02:33,"Yeah, yeah."
01:02:33,01:02:34,You think it was--
01:02:34,01:02:35,[LAUGHTER]
01:02:35,01:02:36,Something you'd remember.
01:02:36,01:02:37,It was me.
01:02:37,01:02:38,It was me.
01:02:38,01:02:39,"Two weeks, living in a church."
01:02:39,01:02:40,Not living.
01:02:40,01:02:41,Sleeping?
01:02:41,01:02:42,Sleeping?
01:02:42,01:02:43,Right.
01:02:43,01:02:44,You're resting?
01:02:44,01:02:45,Yeah.
01:02:45,01:02:46,It was a charity thing.
01:02:46,01:02:47,It was fun.
01:02:47,01:02:48,Yeah.
01:02:48,01:02:49,memorable.
01:02:49,01:02:50,Cool.
01:02:50,01:02:54,"He's got 80,000 photos of the priest to prove it."
01:02:54,01:02:57,"So, Andy, are you going to do the scars for us?"
01:02:57,01:02:59,I have to keep score and hold a microphone in one hand.
01:02:59,01:03:00,I'm not sure I can.
01:03:00,01:03:02,Did anybody got that one?
01:03:02,01:03:03,"OK, so the score is?"
01:03:03,01:03:04,Love all.
01:03:04,01:03:05,Great.
01:03:05,01:03:06,Yep.
01:03:06,01:03:07,"OK, question number two."
01:03:07,01:03:08,This is for Jamie.
01:03:08,01:03:09,Which of us said this?
01:03:09,01:03:14,"Before I moved to London, I was heavily involved in the hedge community."
01:03:14,01:03:18,"Which was, was into hedges."
01:03:18,01:03:19,Hedge community.
01:03:19,01:03:20,Yeah.
01:03:20,01:03:23,Do I look like a man who's into hedges?
01:03:23,01:03:25,I'm going to be honest and say you do.
01:03:25,01:03:28,[LAUGHTER]
01:03:28,01:03:31,But what a lovely pastime.
01:03:31,01:03:34,"Just to make it fair, I'll say Andy."
01:03:34,01:03:37,"Andy, have you ever not lived in London?"
01:03:37,01:03:38,No.
01:03:38,01:03:40,Oh.
01:03:40,01:03:41,It was me.
01:03:41,01:03:42,"What's the story, James?"
01:03:42,01:03:43,There's no story.
01:03:43,01:03:44,I just liked hedges.
01:03:44,01:03:48,"No, I got, I lived in the countryside and someone came around and said,"
01:03:48,01:03:50,would you be interested in giving us some money for hedges?
01:03:50,01:03:51,"And I said, no."
01:03:51,01:03:52,"And they said, what about time?"
01:03:52,01:03:55,And I felt so bad that I spent a lot of time fixing hedges.
01:03:55,01:03:56,Cutting hedges.
01:03:56,01:03:57,Not cutting them.
01:03:57,01:03:58,Not cutting them.
01:03:58,01:04:00,Just sort of going around asking people to pay money.
01:04:00,01:04:01,Oh.
01:04:01,01:04:03,"Oh, that sounds like a pyramid scheme."
01:04:03,01:04:05,[LAUGHTER]
01:04:05,01:04:07,"OK, this one is for you, James."
01:04:07,01:04:08,Yeah.
01:04:08,01:04:09,"OK, who said this?"
01:04:09,01:04:12,I have an unbeatable arm wrestling technique.
01:04:12,01:04:15,But can't do it anymore due to injuries.
01:04:15,01:04:17,"Oh, I'm going to go for Dan."
01:04:17,01:04:20,It's a few murmurs of yes in the audience.
01:04:20,01:04:21,"Dan, how's your arm wrestling?"
01:04:21,01:04:23,Pretty damn good.
01:04:23,01:04:25,But can anyone beat you?
01:04:25,01:04:26,"Uh, yeah."
01:04:26,01:04:27,So many people.
01:04:27,01:04:28,Yeah.
01:04:28,01:04:29,Yeah.
01:04:29,01:04:31,"Andy, there's no point asking you, is there?"
01:04:31,01:04:35,[LAUGHTER]
01:04:35,01:04:39,Does anyone truly think it's Andy?
01:04:39,01:04:40,"Andy, was it you?"
01:04:40,01:04:41,I don't know.
01:04:41,01:04:42,"No, it wasn't."
01:04:42,01:04:43,It's me.
01:04:43,01:04:44,"It's me, my arm."
01:04:44,01:04:45,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:04:45,01:04:46,Wow.
01:04:46,01:04:49,It's just a trick you stand on the right part of the table and you can't lose.
01:04:49,01:04:50,Anyway.
01:04:50,01:04:52,How did you injury-- how did you-- how do you--
01:04:52,01:04:54,I guess a very good arm wrestler.
01:04:54,01:04:55,"Oh, it wasn't."
01:04:55,01:04:56,"It wasn't, it wasn't."
01:04:56,01:04:59,"You can also rip a yellow pages book in half, just like on the spot."
01:04:59,01:05:00,It's really exciting.
01:05:00,01:05:01,But they've stopped making those books now.
01:05:01,01:05:02,So yellow pages.
01:05:02,01:05:03,Boomer.
01:05:03,01:05:04,Yeah.
01:05:04,01:05:05,[LAUGHTER]
01:05:05,01:05:08,Now all my phone numbers are on my phone and you can't rip that in half.
01:05:08,01:05:09,No.
01:05:09,01:05:12,"OK, whichever said this, I got married--"
01:05:12,01:05:15,"sorry, this is for Jamie and Andy Watt's score."
01:05:15,01:05:17,"I think you just got one right, didn't you, James?"
01:05:17,01:05:18,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:05:18,01:05:19,I think James is what--
01:05:19,01:05:20,James is what--
01:05:20,01:05:21,I think.
01:05:21,01:05:22,[LAUGHTER]
01:05:22,01:05:24,This is how I got new to my scoring.
01:05:24,01:05:26,James is one no ahead.
01:05:26,01:05:27,Final answer.
01:05:27,01:05:33,"Is this someone scoring my scoring, please?"
01:05:33,01:05:34,There's an absolute shambles.
01:05:34,01:05:35,OK.
01:05:35,01:05:37,"Jamie Martin, who said this?"
01:05:37,01:05:43,I got married in a room where the Earl of Sandwich invented the sandwich.
01:05:43,01:05:46,"Now, were you any of our weddings?"
01:05:46,01:05:49,"No, I didn't get-- I knew you before you were--"
01:05:49,01:05:50,"Oh, no, you didn't."
01:05:50,01:05:51,We knew each other.
01:05:51,01:05:52,It became happy.
01:05:52,01:05:53,[LAUGHTER]
01:05:53,01:05:55,"We knew each other, and I had two weddings."
01:05:55,01:05:57,"And not invited to either, thanks."
01:05:57,01:05:58,"We were friends, though."
01:05:58,01:05:59,"We knew each other, but we weren't like--"
01:05:59,01:06:00,That's right.
01:06:00,01:06:02,"And the same wife, by the way."
01:06:02,01:06:04,I just want to point that out.
01:06:04,01:06:07,We won a free wedding in a magazine.
01:06:07,01:06:10,"And then so we had our first wedding, and then we did a second wedding two days later."
01:06:10,01:06:11,It was insane.
01:06:11,01:06:13,And was it anywhere near the other sandwich?
01:06:13,01:06:16,[LAUGHTER]
01:06:16,01:06:17,I can't remember.
01:06:17,01:06:18,We definitely had sandwich.
01:06:18,01:06:19,That's kind of the other thing.
01:06:19,01:06:20,What's going on?
01:06:20,01:06:21,"OK, sorry."
01:06:21,01:06:28,So someone got married near the room where the Earl of Sandwich invented the sandwich.
01:06:28,01:06:29,I'm hearing--
01:06:29,01:06:30,I'm not going to say Andy.
01:06:30,01:06:31,OK.
01:06:31,01:06:32,"Andy, what's it you?"
01:06:32,01:06:33,Certainly was.
01:06:33,01:06:34,Yes.
01:06:34,01:06:35,Yeah.
01:06:35,01:06:36,Very nice.
01:06:36,01:06:37,I ran the applause.
01:06:37,01:06:38,Thanks.
01:06:38,01:06:39,Yeah.
01:06:39,01:06:41,For a completely random one in three guests.
01:06:41,01:06:43,I think they just happy that he's married.
01:06:43,01:06:44,I think it was for--
01:06:44,01:06:46,[LAUGHTER]
01:06:46,01:06:47,"Sorry, ladies."
01:06:47,01:06:51,[LAUGHTER]
01:06:51,01:06:52,OK.
01:06:52,01:06:55,I like the room where the Earl of Sandwich invented the sandwich.
01:06:55,01:06:56,Amazing.
01:06:56,01:06:57,And was that a deliberate choice?
01:06:57,01:06:59,Did you choose it because of the sandwich connection?
01:06:59,01:07:00,Of course.
01:07:00,01:07:01,Yeah.
01:07:01,01:07:04,Is this marriage right at the end of the two-week sleepover that you had in the show?
01:07:04,01:07:06,[LAUGHTER]
01:07:06,01:07:07,OK.
01:07:07,01:07:08,"So what's the score, Andy?"
01:07:08,01:07:09,One all.
01:07:09,01:07:11,[LAUGHTER]
01:07:11,01:07:12,I'm so sure of it.
01:07:12,01:07:13,I'm really happy.
01:07:13,01:07:14,OK.
01:07:14,01:07:15,The next question.
01:07:15,01:07:16,Four James.
01:07:16,01:07:17,"This is your last question, in fact."
01:07:17,01:07:18,"Oh, God."
01:07:18,01:07:20,Who said this on the podcast?
01:07:20,01:07:24,"As a child, people always told me I smelled of milk."
01:07:24,01:07:26,[LAUGHTER]
01:07:26,01:07:29,"It sounds ridiculous, but I'm going to go for down again."
01:07:29,01:07:31,Daniel Shriver.
01:07:31,01:07:35,"As a child, did everyone tell you that you smelled of milk?"
01:07:35,01:07:36,They sure did.
01:07:36,01:07:37,[LAUGHTER]
01:07:37,01:07:43,[APPLAUSE]
01:07:43,01:07:45,"Expand, explain."
01:07:45,01:07:47,We'll have a sniff and see if I'm still--
01:07:47,01:07:48,I try to.
01:07:48,01:07:49,"No, that's bullsemen."
01:07:49,01:07:50,[LAUGHTER]
01:07:50,01:07:52,Famously odeless.
01:07:52,01:07:53,OK.
01:07:53,01:07:55,Final question for Jamie.
01:07:55,01:07:56,And it's two-one.
01:07:56,01:07:57,It's two-one.
01:07:57,01:07:59,[LAUGHTER]
01:07:59,01:08:01,Please get this wrong.
01:08:01,01:08:03,Who on the podcast said this?
01:08:03,01:08:08,I love to watch Oprah Winfrey clips of military homecoming
01:08:08,01:08:10,videos to make myself cry.
01:08:10,01:08:18,[LAUGHTER]
01:08:18,01:08:20,I actually need to go.
01:08:20,01:08:23,But this has been really fun.
01:08:23,01:08:27,You're looking at three very emotionally sensitive men.
01:08:27,01:08:28,Clearly.
01:08:28,01:08:29,Could be anyone.
01:08:29,01:08:30,Four.
01:08:30,01:08:31,Oprah Winfrey.
01:08:31,01:08:32,[LAUGHTER]
01:08:32,01:08:34,Thank you.
01:08:34,01:08:37,"James, it was not me."
01:08:37,01:08:41,I have never cried in my life.
01:08:41,01:08:42,Andrew Hunter Murray.
01:08:42,01:08:43,Are you the funsome cryer?
01:08:43,01:08:44,Nope.
01:08:44,01:08:46,Daniel Shriver.
01:08:46,01:08:48,Huh?
01:08:48,01:08:49,"Shut up, whatever."
01:08:49,01:08:50,"Yes, OK."
01:08:50,01:08:52,I watch Oprah Winfrey clips and cry.
01:08:52,01:08:54,There's one where someone bought her shoes and they stand in them
