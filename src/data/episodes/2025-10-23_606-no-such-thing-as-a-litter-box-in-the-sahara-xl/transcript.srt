00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
 Hello and welcome to a very special bit of content.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,080
 Now this is what we call big fish.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,840
 It is an XL version of a previous episode of No Six Things A Fish and we have put it up

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,160
 here to show you exactly what you can get if you go to the plenty more fish tier of club

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,360
 fish.

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,780
 On top of this you will get a video version of DROPPERS ALINE and you will also get a

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,040
 vinyl sticker after staying with us for three months.

8
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,600
 For the people who want a little bit more fish in their lives and that's why we called

9
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,640
 it plenty more fish.

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,640
 If you want to go even higher still you can go to friend of the podcast where you will

11
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:44,840
 get an exclusive t-shirt access to a three monthly video quiz and you will get access to

12
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,000
 the archives of No Six Things A Fish.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,400
 We call it the aquarium.

14
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:53,440
 It's got loads of unreleased material in there and of course you will become custodian

15
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,280
 of a fact one of our lovely little facts will be put into your custodian ship and you will

16
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,440
 also get a mention on the main feed.

17
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,040
 So thank you for joining our top tier.

18
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,720
 But if you don't want any of that then fear not because the main episode of fish that goes

19
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,000
 out every Friday is free and will always be free.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Anyway, really hope you enjoy this XL version of fish on with the big fish!

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:33,400
 Good evening ladies and gentlemen and welcome to No Such Things A Fish.

22
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,560
 Are you ready?

23
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:47,560
 Please welcome to the stage No Such Thing As A Fish.

24
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,240
 Thank you everyone for being here.

25
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,240
 Thank you so much.

26
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,240
 This is very exciting for us.

27
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,400
 We love doing our live shows.

28
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,320
 We're very proud to have been invited to the 10 year anniversary of the London Podcast

29
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,320
 Festival.

30
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,640
 This is something that we played quite a few times.

31
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,720
 Do we ever play it the first year?

32
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,720
 No.

33
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,720
 We weren't invited.

34
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,720
 No.

35
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,720
 But why don't we bring out our guests?

36
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,800
 We have a very exciting guest.

37
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,880
 So it's not just the 10 year anniversary of the London Podcast Festival, but on the 4th

38
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:18,880
 of October 2015 a woman called Belinda blinked for the very first time.

39
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:24,880
 She blinked into existence and it gave birth to what is basically the pop culture podcast

40
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,200
 phenomena of the UK and we're very excited to have one of the members here.

41
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,040
 Could you please welcome onto the stage celebrating his 10 year anniversary of his own show.

42
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,360
 His dad wrote a porno.

43
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,760
 Jamie Morden, everyone.

44
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:44,680
 10 years.

45
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,720
 This is the first place we ever played porno.

46
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,720
 That's true.

47
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,720
 Oh, really?

48
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,720
 You first have a live show.

49
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,720
 Yes.

50
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,720
 Yeah.

51
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,720
 That's cool, man.

52
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,720
 I was here for it.

53
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,720
 Yes, stalker.

54
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,720
 Yeah.

55
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,720
 Didn't know him.

56
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,720
 Still don't really.

57
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,320
 I was in the audience and they did a tombola thing at the end to give away a prize and they picked

58
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:09,200
 out a winner and the first winner was for a row that didn't exist in the room.

59
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,440
 So this secret.

60
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,440
 Yeah.

61
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,520
 Surely every theatre has a row.

62
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,040
 It was like 0.2 or so.

63
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,040
 That's not a row.

64
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,040
 It was really weird.

65
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,040
 It took ages to work out the row didn't exist and then they did it again and it was a sold-out

66
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,040
 show.

67
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,040
 It landed on the only seat that was empty.

68
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,040
 So no one.

69
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,040
 Thanks, Dan.

70
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,240
 So anyway, I love you to be here, but then the third one came and it was my seat.

71
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,240
 And I won.

72
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,240
 Yeah.

73
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,920
 And I came up and it looked like the whole thing was fixed and grew in the moment.

74
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,920
 What did you win?

75
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,920
 A mug.

76
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,920
 A mug.

77
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,920
 Signed?

78
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,920
 Yeah.

79
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,920
 By?

80
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,920
 Your dad.

81
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,920
 Of course.

82
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,920
 He signs everything.

83
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,920
 If you can find a mug that isn't signed by dad, it's worth the fortune.

84
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,920
 I'm just so excited.

85
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,920
 I'm so just to level with everyone.

86
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,360
 This is such an intense show to do.

87
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,360
 There's so much prep.

88
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,360
 It's like homework.

89
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,360
 I've been cramming.

90
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,360
 Yeah.

91
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,360
 Where's your dad now?

92
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,360
 Yeah.

93
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,240
 I'm nothing without him as you're all about to see.

94
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,040
 You should have got him to do your research.

95
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,040
 That would have been incredible.

96
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,040
 Oh my God.

97
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,040
 Next time.

98
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,040
 Next time.

99
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,040
 Well, listen, we've got a show to do.

100
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,040
 We don't have a tumbola, but we do have a competition, don't we?

101
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,040
 Absolutely.

102
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,840
 Because you guys have been sending in your facts, which I've got on my phone here.

103
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,200
 What we're going to do is we're going to read a few of them out and then we're going

104
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:25,640
 to choose one winner and that person will go into a head-to-head against our very special

105
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,640
 guest tonight.

106
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,400
 So it's a big prize.

107
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,960
 I'll read out a few facts and we'll decide which is our favourite thing.

108
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,960
 Okay.

109
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,960
 So here's one.

110
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,960
 It's not going to name on it.

111
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,480
 It's from Road 0.2.

112
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:43,640
 They said a new spider has been discovered in Australia, which is now known to be the most

113
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,520
 dangerous spider.

114
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:53,160
 It's a subspecies of the Sydney for the web and it's called the Newcastle Big Boy.

115
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,160
 That is good.

116
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,160
 That's a great face.

117
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,160
 That's it.

118
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,160
 Can we see the audience?

119
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,160
 Yes, please.

120
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,640
 Who's that audience?

121
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,640
 Confess.

122
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,640
 Oh, there it is.

123
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,640
 Right at the back.

124
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,640
 Oh, the way.

125
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,440
 The only spot that the light does not hit.

126
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,640
 What's your name?

127
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,640
 Charlie.

128
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,640
 Charlie.

129
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,640
 And are you from Australia?

130
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,640
 Oh, good.

131
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,640
 Oh, wow.

132
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,640
 And here's another one.

133
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,160
 This is from James and Kerry and this is much more low-brow.

134
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,080
 House fly sperm is larger than human sperm.

135
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,080
 Really?

136
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,080
 What?

137
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,080
 House fly sperm.

138
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,880
 House fly sperm is larger than human sperm.

139
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,880
 I know what a sperm I know about.

140
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,360
 I've had 10 years of sperm.

141
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,360
 Professionally.

142
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,360
 How do you know this?

143
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,360
 You know what I mean.

144
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,160
 Five to six centriots is boiled up.

145
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,160
 Five to six centriots.

146
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,160
 And the house fly.

147
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,160
 Brilliant.

148
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,720
 Well, here's another one.

149
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,440
 Again, I don't have a name on this.

150
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,640
 This person says they're recovering from a broken ankle.

151
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:51,780
 It's a talus bone fracture, which is known as the aviator fracture, because when Spitfire

152
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:56,480
 pilots crash landed their planes, they had to keep their feet on the pedals until

153
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,800
 they were safely down and so they would all break their ankles when they landed.

154
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,800
 Yikes.

155
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,400
 Who is the person with a broken ankle?

156
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,400
 What's your name?

157
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,400
 Sadie.

158
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,400
 Sadie.

159
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,400
 That's a terrific fact.

160
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,400
 Do you want to choose one?

161
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,000
 Well, I guess Jamie, you're going to be going up against someone.

162
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,800
 Who do you think you can beat those people?

163
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,800
 What was it?

164
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,800
 New culture people.

165
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,800
 It's got to be the sperm.

166
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,800
 I'm sorry.

167
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,800
 OK.

168
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,880
 So, James or Kerry, would you be willing to come up on stage in a bit later?

169
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,880
 One of you.

170
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,880
 Tell you when.

171
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,120
 Stay where you are for now.

172
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,280
 You've got a full hour to worry about it.

173
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,280
 Kerry's just made very clear.

174
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,760
 It's going to be James giving up on stage.

175
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,760
 All right.

176
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,240
 Well, you guys ready for us to do a show?

177
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,520
 Roll the theme tune.

178
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:55,640
 Hello and welcome to another episode of

179
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,640
 No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast.

180
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:06,360
 This week coming to you live from the London Podcast Festival.

181
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,120
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

182
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,560
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin, and Jamie Morton.

183
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,080
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

184
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,560
 from the last seven days.

185
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,040
 And in no particular order, here we go.

186
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,200
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Jamie.

187
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,280
 No particular order, the guest first.

188
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,280
 OK.

189
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,280
 Don't destroy our show straight away.

190
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,280
 It's just a light.

191
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,280
 I like it.

192
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,280
 OK.

193
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:40,600
 Iconic, Festbian, beer bone, had a walk on part in every single production at the Geal

194
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,640
 Good Theatre in London's West End for 20 years.

195
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:50,880
 And fittingly, had a front page obituary in the stage newspaper.

196
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:56,280
 He was also a cat.

197
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,280
 I know.

198
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,320
 I mean, like, what a hag.

199
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,520
 I'm sorry.

200
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,240
 That is a Festbian cat.

201
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:01,840
 That is.

202
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,840
 Yeah.

203
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,680
 For people listening on the podcast next week, or whenever it goes out, can you describe

204
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,760
 the cat who was Jamie?

205
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,840
 We've got a tabby cat, he's male.

206
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,360
 And he's lounging on stage at the Geal Good.

207
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,720
 Looking very happy with his beautifully lit.

208
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,480
 It's black and white.

209
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,160
 It's very-- it sounds like a headshot, but it's a full body.

210
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,160
 Yeah.

211
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,160
 Yeah.

212
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,160
 Shea's long kind of look.

213
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,960
 That little-- is that a photo of a tail?

214
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,280
 He's like saying, paint me like one of your French cats.

215
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,280
 It's giving that energy.

216
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,280
 Oh, yeah.

217
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,280
 Yeah.

218
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,840
 Say the opulence as well around it in terms of the architecture.

219
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,840
 Yeah.

220
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,840
 I mean, I love this cat.

221
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,840
 So--

222
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,840
 I'm not going to lie.

223
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,840
 I've fallen in love with him this week.

224
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,840
 I've never heard of him before, but now I love him.

225
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:43,600
 So when you say walk on roll in all the plays, was that official, was he-- was he written

226
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,600
 into--

227
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,600
 No.

228
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,600
 No.

229
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,920
 Is the resident-- is it like Mouser?

230
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,920
 Is that--

231
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,160
 Yeah, Mouser name that they caught the mice.

232
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,800
 And he just would randomly walk on stage during productions, which, being a theatre director,

233
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,840
 I find chilling, because you work so hard to kind of make a show good, then some fucking

234
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,120
 cats just like wandering in front of everyone.

235
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,120
 And what did the actors think of it?

236
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,120
 Were they--

237
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,880
 Well, the actors, like, loved this cat.

238
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,520
 Like, almost uniformly, I think there wasn't a single actor who didn't love him.

239
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:21,360
 And he didn't love beer bone, because he is, as I said, a total hag.

240
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,360
 I mean, look at him.

241
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:29,040
 But yeah, he was loved, and-- and people got very attached to him.

242
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,200
 So much so that he had this obituary on the front page of the stage newspaper.

243
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,960
 And people like Penelope Keith wrote obituries for him, like loads of actors kind of got involved.

244
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,320
 The stage, I hadn't heard of the stage, is that, like, the main, main thing that you

245
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,320
 can get on it?

246
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,320
 The Bible.

247
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,320
 Dan, honestly.

248
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,320
 Oh, man.

249
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,320
 I actually heard of it.

250
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,840
 I was just being them for a second.

251
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,840
 Yeah.

252
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,840
 Then they've heard of it, too.

253
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,480
 Oh, so it is just being-- it's a great news paper, yeah.

254
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,480
 No, it is.

255
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,480
 It's a great news paper.

256
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,480
 It's behind a play wall, but it's great.

257
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,760
 OK, a lot of people did love beer bone, but beer bone would arrive on stage at moments

258
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,600
 that weren't necessarily good for a scene.

259
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,520
 You know, there was one-- there was one play that was on, which was called the House of

260
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:12,000
 Bernard Alba, which had a lot of sand all over the stage.

261
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 Oh, no.

262
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,360
 Beer bone was the ultimate pooing ground.

263
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,520
 That was not good, right, at this moment.

264
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,520
 Not good for who?

265
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,520
 We loved it.

266
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,520
 It adds realism to the play.

267
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,520
 Oh, yeah.

268
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,520
 That's where it's set.

269
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:31,080
 If it's set in the pitiless desert of the Sahara, it actually, I would say, kills the

270
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,480
 mood a bit to have a house cat.

271
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,480
 There are enough.

272
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,680
 Some people think it's good luck for a cat to be on stage, and in America, at least, there

273
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:44,000
 was a superstition that if a black cat came into the theatre, that was really good luck.

274
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,760
 And if it came on the first night, that was really, really good luck, and the whole show

275
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,760
 was going to be amazing.

276
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,760
 Right.

277
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,280
 And so the fifth avenue theatre in New York used to keep a black cat backstage, and then

278
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:00,440
 on the first show of every run, that they would throw it out there so that it was on stage.

279
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,440
 And that was good luck.

280
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,440
 Oh, yeah.

281
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,480
 And the reason you said "Mouser" a second ago, Jamie, the reason that cats used to be very,

282
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,240
 very important in theatre is because back in the day, food being thrown on stage to show

283
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,280
 your all-pleasure or pleasure in a play was a massive thing.

284
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,920
 So at the end of every night, food was just everywhere, all over the stage, which brought

285
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,640
 in the mice, and mice were a huge, huge problem.

286
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,320
 So theatres would have, sometimes, up to 20 cats roaming around, catching mice if they

287
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,320
 had problems.

288
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,760
 But a lot of those cats would lie on their CVs.

289
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,600
 You've put on who you also do birds.

290
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,600
 Is that true?

291
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,600
 Oh, yeah.

292
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,600
 Yeah.

293
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,400
 The film was on the payroll, I read.

294
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,880
 He was officially listed on the Gilgur payroll, which, as a former accountant, I think brings

295
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,920
 up a whole host of problems.

296
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,240
 Like, who pays the national insurance on that?

297
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,240
 Yep.

298
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,240
 I wonder who his agent was?

299
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,240
 I don't know.

300
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,240
 Someone bloody good.

301
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,240
 15% of a count.

302
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,320
 And apparently, he would disappear from time to time, according to Dame Hilda Brackett,

303
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,800
 he would dash off to see a particular friend at the Lyric theatre.

304
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,800
 His girlfriend?

305
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,800
 Yeah.

306
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,280
 She said, "We used to hear lots of meows.

307
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,280
 This was so how after all."

308
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,280
 I love it.

309
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:10,840
 Do you think, well, look, most West Enfielders have cats, as you said.

310
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,840
 Yeah.

311
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,840
 They're all mates.

312
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,840
 Do you think they just, like, all meet up at...

313
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,720
 Oh, that's a cute, that's a great show, though, that you should have seen the performers

314
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,720
 for this.

315
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,480
 Well, the lots of theatres did have cats in there.

316
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,120
 So the Noel Cow Theatre had two cats, imaginative, called Girl Cat and Boy Cat.

317
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,040
 And I think Boy Cat only ever distinguished himself once when he ate Princess Margaret's

318
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,040
 bouquet.

319
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,040
 Is that a euphemism?

320
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,040
 No, it's not.

321
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,160
 It's a bloody good one, isn't it?

322
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:44,800
 Yeah, apparently, he also escaped offstage during a performance of a musical five-guys'

323
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,200
 name Moe, and he would go under the stage and he would only come out when someone tapped

324
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,200
 out Stolverham.

325
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,200
 Right.

326
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:57,400
 There was a cat called Ambrose at the theatre Royal Jury Lane, which I think you've performed

327
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,400
 at.

328
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,400
 Oh, yeah.

329
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,880
 And this cat got into a beef with Michael Crawford.

330
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:08,040
 He kept upstaging Michael Crawford and Michael Crawford had no sense of humour about this.

331
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,080
 It's Michael Crawford, the original phantom, yes.

332
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,880
 But was he also Frank Spencer?

333
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,880
 Yeah, Frank Spencer.

334
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,880
 Open tea.

335
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,880
 That guy.

336
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,880
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

337
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,880
 A varied career, I think.

338
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,880
 I was going to say yellow.

339
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,880
 But then, and so, Michael Crawford was like kicking off about this cat, but every single

340
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,760
 person in the theatre took the cat's side.

341
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,760
 What does that say?

342
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,760
 Wow.

343
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,640
 I read about one that was at the Sadler's Wells.

344
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:36,880
 It was called Sadler, the cat, and Sadler in 1956 just suddenly disappeared.

345
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,440
 But unlike the other cats who would come on unprompted, Sadler actually had a role in

346
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,440
 a play.

347
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,440
 Oh, no.

348
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:47,440
 So, in the stage, magazine, they had an advert to audition for a new cat for the show, and

349
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,760
 I found the advert.

350
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:53,600
 It said, owing to the dramatic disappearance of Sadler, official theatre cat at the Wells,

351
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,720
 the important feline role and the forthcoming production of School of Fathers falls vacant

352
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:03,000
 or additions will be held, applicants must be fully grown and capable of maintaining dignity

353
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,400
 and poise atop a 10-foot high wall, despite the distractions of a full, operatic orchestra

354
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,240
 and audience laughter and applause.

355
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,880
 The chosen artist will receive full her service, one sardine and two complementary tickets

356
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,880
 per performance.

357
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,680
 Wow.

358
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,440
 And did you see who got the part?

359
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,440
 No.

360
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:24,760
 It was a cat called Keats, and according to the Daily Telegraphy beat off tough composition

361
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:31,720
 from cats called Fantasia, Nimbus, Klott and Mr Woodbury Bentley.

362
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,720
 And they had two auditions.

363
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,120
 In the second audition, he jumped off the wall that he was sitting on and then walked over

364
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,600
 to the bar and started knocking down bottles, and they decided this was a perfect cat for

365
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,600
 the theatre.

366
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,520
 You know, this is exactly what the old actors would do, so, yeah.

367
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,520
 So good.

368
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,520
 How can you cast a cat in a play?

369
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:53,280
 They just, they famously don't play bull, well, they play with bulls, but you know what

370
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,280
 I mean.

371
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,280
 Yeah.

372
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,280
 I know.

373
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,280
 To direct, I would imagine.

374
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,280
 Yeah.

375
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,280
 Dogs, I think, do get a look in sometimes on the West End.

376
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,800
 I was trying to find other animals that have been in West End productions.

377
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,800
 Yeah.

378
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,800
 Oh, yeah.

379
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,440
 So there was a Guardian report in 2001 that there was a production of The Taming of the

380
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,960
 True, which had an entire cast of chickens, and I cannot find out whether it was like a

381
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:16,000
 whole flock of chickens and a human cast or whether it was an entire cast of chickens.

382
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 Ah.

383
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 Like.

384
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 But when they all fired, I think.

385
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 They were sacked, yes.

386
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 Yeah.

387
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 Apparently for being too hysterical.

388
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,360
 I don't know what the hysterical chicken can't imagine how hysterical they got when they

389
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,360
 were told they were fired.

390
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,360
 Yeah.

391
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,360
 That's the big on the room.

392
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,360
 Guys, we're going to have fun.

393
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,360
 You go.

394
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,640
 By the way, beer bomb, the cat.

395
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,640
 Do we know?

396
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,240
 Do you guys know why it's called beer bomb?

397
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,480
 There was a famous actor called beer, but I don't know what they're going to say.

398
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,480
 Yeah.

399
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,480
 He was a theater manager.

400
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,480
 He was an actor as well.

401
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:48,560
 His name was Sir Herbert Beerbomb Tree, and he founded Rada, the Royal Academy of Dramatic

402
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,560
 Arts.

403
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,560
 Yeah.

404
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,560
 And he's a pretty, he's a pretty amazing character.

405
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,880
 He released a few records.

406
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,960
 He did hamlets to be or not to be on vinyl.

407
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,960
 That's pretty cool.

408
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,640
 It's just really sin his own stuff.

409
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:04,800
 But he also, he's from the Beerbomb family, which is quite an amazing family, Max Beerbomb.

410
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,360
 The satirical writer was part of that family.

411
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,840
 Virtually every child that he had was part of some major bit of theater in the day.

412
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,320
 He had a lot of illegitimate children as well.

413
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,320
 His grandson from one of those moments was Oliver Reed.

414
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,120
 So he's very connected.

415
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,440
 He's basically the reason that Shakespeare is so popular today, Beerbomb Tree, I think.

416
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,440
 Right.

417
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,360
 Yeah, because in those days, so this was what?

418
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,480
 It was 19th century.

419
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,040
 People were kind of putting Shakespeare on, but it was very stuffy.

420
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,040
 People didn't really like it.

421
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,200
 It was going out of fashion.

422
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,440
 And then he started putting loads of Shakespeare plays on and making them real sort of blockbuster

423
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,040
 shows so that everyone loved to go there and loved to see it.

424
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,560
 And he was also the person who put, I think, the first film Shakespeare?

425
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,520
 I think he was the guy who did that as well.

426
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:49,520
 Right.

427
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,040
 He went over to America and did a hamlet on my path, I was up in.

428
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,040
 Right.

429
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,040
 Yeah, he's a...

430
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,760
 So he's what's a blame, basically?

431
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,760
 Yeah, yeah.

432
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:03,680
 And also, randomly, in the play "Cats," there is a reference which is said to Gus from

433
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,680
 "Geliorum."

434
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,920
 Is that the name of the cat in it?

435
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,920
 The line as he's acted with Oving, he's acted with Tree.

436
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,920
 "Cats."

437
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,920
 I'm so glad we're on "Cats."

438
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,560
 So thing one, when you think about it, "Cats" is an anagram of "Cast."

439
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,560
 Okay.

440
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,560
 And?

441
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,760
 Boy, it just makes you think, doesn't it?

442
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,760
 Yeah.

443
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,760
 Yeah.

444
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,760
 And it's also an anagram of "Act."

445
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,760
 Oh, my God.

446
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,760
 I was so pleased with myself.

447
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,760
 "Cast."

448
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,160
 And they got to stack, but without the cage.

449
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,160
 Nah.

450
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,160
 And they thought, oh, that's brilliant.

451
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,160
 Is that it?

452
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,760
 That was the fact.

453
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,760
 That was the fact.

454
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:45,120
 He messaged us, saying, "I've got some amazing stuff on cats that I need to say on stage."

455
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,320
 "I spent six hours reading about the musical cats because you had a cat's back, and that was it."

456
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,120
 Well, I just wanted to introduce yours.

457
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,120
 Yeah, go on.

458
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,320
 Well, I have quite a good one about cats, the musical.

459
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,320
 Do you?

460
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,320
 Yeah.

461
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,320
 For its broadway run, they used over 49,000 condoms.

462
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,320
 Ah!

463
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,320
 Oh, sorry!

464
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,320
 Yeah.

465
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,320
 Can we guess?

466
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,320
 Why?

467
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,320
 "Dentch."

468
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,320
 "Dentch."

469
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,320
 "Dentch."

470
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,320
 "Dentch."

471
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,320
 Sadly, "Dentch."

472
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,320
 "Ruptured Her Achilles," so couldn't perform in cats.

473
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,720
 Although she was originally cats.

474
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,720
 She was meant to be.

475
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,720
 She was originally cats.

476
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,720
 In cats.

477
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,720
 In cats.

478
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,720
 Yeah.

479
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,720
 Why do you think they used so many condoms?

480
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,720
 To stop things from getting wet is my first thought.

481
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,720
 What sort of thing?

482
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,720
 You smuggle drugs for the cast.

483
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,720
 No, you're on the right lines, James.

484
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,720
 Yeah.

485
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,120
 To protect something.

486
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,120
 Is it?

487
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,120
 Okay.

488
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,120
 Oh, is it for...

489
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:43,360
 So a lot of preppers will use condoms to store water because a condom, like a water balloon,

490
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,960
 holds gallons of water.

491
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,960
 Absolutely not.

492
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,960
 I know.

493
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:53,560
 If you ever go to Danesford, dinner, he offers still sparkling or pure tasting of spermicide.

494
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,560
 Sorry, Andy.

495
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,560
 Cats have claws, don't they?

496
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,560
 Yes.

497
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:03,560
 So it's to protect the claws in transit and they had 49...

498
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,560
 Well, real cats have claws.

499
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,560
 This is a show with people.

500
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,560
 Yeah.

501
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,560
 Alright, put us out and move.

502
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,560
 It was...

503
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,560
 You were right, James.

504
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,160
 It was to protect their microphone packs.

505
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,360
 They were sweating so much because it's a dance show, right?

506
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,760
 They're dancing so much that they would put their mic packs in condoms.

507
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,760
 49,000?

508
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,760
 Yeah.

509
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,760
 After each show, they're just like tip loads of condoms in the bin outside of this.

510
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,760
 Oh, it's a sweet show.

511
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:32,160
 While we're on Andrew Lloyd Webber, there's another cat connection, which is the fact that

512
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,560
 Phantom of the Opera now has a sequel.

513
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:38,920
 Many, many years ago Lloyd Webber was working on that sequel and he was rising it with

514
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,560
 Frederick Forsyth, the author.

515
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,760
 The author, the author, exactly.

516
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,760
 So they were writing it.

517
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,440
 He'd written all the music and he had it on his electric piano and then one day he sat

518
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:53,200
 down to write a new song and his kitten, called Otto, stepped on the keyboard and erased the

519
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,320
 entire score.

520
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,320
 And so we never got it.

521
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,880
 The main thing about Cat Charlie is the movie, the amazing movie that came out a few years ago.

522
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,880
 Oh, yeah.

523
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,840
 And it was really the start of the pandemic, I think.

524
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,680
 It was right at the start of the pandemic, wasn't it?

525
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,680
 Yeah.

526
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,680
 I was at that moment.

527
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,680
 It was the pandemic.

528
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,680
 I don't know.

529
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,680
 It was not longer.

530
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:15,320
 We knew something bad was in the air when cats came out.

531
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:20,240
 And the big thing about that is the CGI bumholes that all the cats had.

532
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,240
 Wow.

533
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,240
 Isn't it?

534
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,720
 Well, there is, is it true or not, because that is urban myth, is it true?

535
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,720
 It's urban myth.

536
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:32,280
 So someone tweeted, a guy called Jack Waz, and I think, I mean, that sounds like an honest

537
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,280
 man, doesn't it?

538
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,280
 Jack Waz.

539
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,280
 The thing is James, you go to such impeccable lengths to source all of your facts.

540
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,480
 Like James goes deep into newspaper archives from 200 years ago, but he will also sometimes

541
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,200
 throw in like, at Jack Waz, I don't know.

542
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,280
 At Jack Waz is the New York Times of our day.

543
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:55,200
 He said that a VFX producer, friend of a friend, was hired to get rid of the bumholes, right?

544
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:01,000
 But then the Daily Beast online magazine found a VFX person, and they said it was true.

545
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,160
 And they were definitely someone who worked on the show.

546
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:08,120
 And they said what had happened was actually the way the visual effects worked is they had

547
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,920
 a very special way of the fur being made.

548
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,800
 And the fur would go in little like holes, like your hair does, you know, you have walls in

549
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,800
 your hair.

550
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,920
 And so they had them on all the cats, and it just so happened that if you got them any

551
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:26,320
 of them from a certain angle, it looked like they had female genitalia or an anus.

552
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:31,280
 And they had to imply one person who basically it was their job to go through looking for

553
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,760
 the bumholes and then get rid of them.

554
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,760
 Right.

555
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,760
 That's insane.

556
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,240
 That's such a high pressure job as well.

557
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,920
 You've got to catch every single one, you know?

558
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,920
 It's true.

559
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,920
 Yeah, yeah.

560
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,920
 I put them on.

561
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,920
 Yeah.

562
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,920
 I love it.

563
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,000
 They could catch all of the bumholes, but not Judith and she's wedding ring, which is on

564
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 throughout the fucking process.

565
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 How is it?

566
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 As like an old cat.

567
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,040
 So you got all of the rings, but one in the end.

568
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,040
 Is that good?

569
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,000
 Hey, I need to move us on to our next fight.

570
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 Oh, oh.

571
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 Oh, they just have one more thing.

572
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 Yeah, sure, yeah.

573
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,160
 Alice Swift's cat, right?

574
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,160
 In the movie.

575
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,160
 She's in the film.

576
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,160
 Oh, no, I mean her actual cat.

577
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,160
 Yes.

578
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,240
 It's called Olivia Benson.

579
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:17,560
 And it is reportedly worth over double the net worth of her fiance.

580
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,560
 It's her fiance Kelsey.

581
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,560
 Yeah, yeah.

582
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:24,840
 But Travis Kelsey is worth a mega $40 million.

583
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:31,120
 This fucking cat is worth 97 million dollars.

584
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:36,920
 And it says that most of that wealth has come from the cat's TV commercial work and Swift's

585
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,200
 music videos of blank space and me.

586
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,200
 It's called.

587
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,200
 Okay.

588
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,960
 Where it's made all of its money.

589
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,960
 What's the source of it?

590
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,960
 Is this jacket?

591
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,960
 Yeah.

592
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,960
 I'm not buying it.

593
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,960
 That's very interesting.

594
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,960
 Yeah.

595
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,960
 Wow.

596
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,720
 How awful that her cat is worth double her fiance.

597
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,720
 I think it's okay.

598
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,720
 No, it is okay.

599
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,680
 How many Super Bowls is he won?

600
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,680
 That's the thing.

601
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,280
 Kelsey's won a couple of Super Bowls.

602
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,280
 I see.

603
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,200
 I thought you meant Kelsey Grammer who played Frazier.

604
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,360
 It's just as two brothers that I can never remember which ones.

605
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,200
 Because I know a lot more about NFL than I do about Taylor Swift.

606
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,200
 Is the truth.

607
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,200
 So name is Kelsey.

608
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,200
 I understand that.

609
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,200
 Cool.

610
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,080
 Interestingly, the one only major other pop culture reference to Herbert Beerbom Tree

611
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,360
 is in an episode of Frazier with Kelsey Grammer.

612
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,360
 No.

613
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,360
 Yeah.

614
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,360
 Who would have thought that would come up?

615
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,360
 It's in a thing called...

616
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,960
 This is all scripts, you guys.

617
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,880
 It's in the episode Daphne's Room.

618
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,520
 The plot involves Frazier's retrieval of a book from her room called The Life and Times

619
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,560
 of Sohera Burt Beerbom Tree.

620
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,560
 Great.

621
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,560
 Anyway, moving on.

622
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,280
 It's great to end with a bang.

623
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,280
 You know?

624
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,280
 Actually.

625
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,280
 Yeah.

626
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:46,120
 So it's time for fact number two.

627
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,240
 And that is my fact.

628
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:53,240
 My fact this week is that at one of the oldest bath houses in Japan, visitors have the

629
00:23:53,240 --> 00:24:07,240
 option of soaking in hot water, cold water, electric water or condom water.

630
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,760
 We need to call them and suggest that.

631
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,760
 No.

632
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,760
 The final one.

633
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,080
 There are many others, but the other one is radioactive water.

634
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,080
 Ooh.

635
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,080
 Yeah.

636
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,520
 People also drink this water.

637
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:20,680
 So it turns out I thought this was going to be unique to this one place in Japan, which

638
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:27,520
 is a radium onsen, an onsen as a word that means bath houses in Japan that use hot spring

639
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,240
 water and they take natural source water.

640
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,240
 And they use that.

641
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:35,240
 There's something like 25,000 hot spring sources in Japan that are used there everywhere.

642
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,240
 Yeah.

643
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,640
 And 3,000 onsen establishments all over Japan.

644
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,640
 So it's a real big thing there.

645
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,440
 And so like the electric water that you would sit in, that actually sends mild electric

646
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,880
 currents through the water as you're sitting in it.

647
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:52,600
 And people describe it as like being tickled by lightning as you're trying to relax.

648
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,600
 How relaxing.

649
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,600
 Yeah.

650
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:58,320
 Well, they see these baths not as necessarily completely relaxing.

651
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,160
 It's all about rejuvenation, it's all about health and so on.

652
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,840
 And so radioactive water, radium water is a thing.

653
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,080
 It's not bad for you, is it?

654
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,360
 The quantities are really, really small.

655
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,880
 The quantities are less than you would get if you were on a flight, for example.

656
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,360
 But that's flight.

657
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:21,320
 You know, we get hit by radioactive, you know, flares from space as you're on a flight.

658
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:25,720
 So James, quick jump in.

659
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:30,080
 There is radiation that comes from space and if the closer you are to it, the less space.

660
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,080
 Space.

661
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,080
 Space.

662
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,080
 It's a flight.

663
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,080
 Not Katy Perry.

664
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,080
 But it means you.

665
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:41,080
 But there's less of the atmosphere to block it out when your fervor up is the basics.

666
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,880
 But if you're on a plane all the time, it'll be bad for you.

667
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:47,720
 Like a air hostess or a pilot, for example, and it's bad for you.

668
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,720
 It's bad for you.

669
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,720
 What the hell are you talking about?

670
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,520
 They said that like it's safest way to travel.

671
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,520
 No.

672
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,760
 But if you live in Cornwall, there's radiation there too.

673
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,760
 Yeah.

674
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,520
 But here's some good lead box at the end of this.

675
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,640
 So there is radiation in Cornwall.

676
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,840
 Cornwall has more background radiation than anywhere else, but we all have a little bit.

677
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:13,000
 And a normal person would get two to three millisieverts of radiation in a year.

678
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,040
 Well, there's a place called Ramsai in a run that has the highest radiation anywhere in

679
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,040
 the world.

680
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:21,440
 It's because they have hot springs and radiation underground and it comes up.

681
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:27,960
 And they get 260 millisieverts per year, which is more than 100 times what a normal person

682
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,960
 would get.

683
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,840
 But actually, the cancer incidence there is lower than any of their neighbours.

684
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,840
 Right.

685
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,040
 And what people think is the people who live there, they have a higher proportion of what's

686
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,040
 called T cells.

687
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,680
 Remember in Covid, they said T cells, it's like, helped your immune system.

688
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,920
 And it turns out that people there have got higher proportion of T cells and it's the thing

689
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:51,560
 called Hormesis, which is the idea that very small low doses of something that would otherwise

690
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:54,760
 be harmful can actually make you stronger.

691
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:59,760
 And it is really, I mean, I'm not saying everyone should go out now and get as much radiation

692
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,760
 as possible.

693
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,760
 But it is.

694
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,760
 You just have a great time.

695
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,760
 That's amazing.

696
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,760
 Yeah.

697
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,760
 That really is amazing.

698
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,760
 It's very cool.

699
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:10,480
 So as I was saying a second ago, these are massive in Japan and I was trying to find more

700
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,120
 information about this very specific one in Osaka.

701
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:20,240
 And the best place I could find out about it was a website called tatufriendlyonson.com.

702
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:26,400
 And this is so interesting because in Japan, when you go to an onsen, largely it's separated.

703
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,400
 So men will go into one place.

704
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,400
 One will go into another.

705
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,400
 You have to be naked.

706
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,400
 You've got to be completely naked.

707
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:35,120
 And the problem is in Japan, if you have tattoos, you're not allowed to go and show

708
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,960
 your tattoos in these places because of the yakuza.

709
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,760
 So a lot of foreigners arrive trying to go...

710
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,360
 Because they're the gangsters.

711
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,360
 Yeah.

712
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,360
 The mafia basically.

713
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,360
 Yeah.

714
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,360
 Who are tattoos, typically.

715
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,360
 Yeah.

716
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,360
 Exactly.

717
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,240
 And so if you arrive and you've got like, you know, like, eternity, I love cherry, whatever

718
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,240
 on your face.

719
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,240
 I love...

720
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:57,240
 It's so revealing knowing what you would have gone for, though.

721
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,440
 I didn't want to talk about my actual tattoos.

722
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,440
 Okay.

723
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,440
 I will.

724
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,440
 So, thug life across your...

725
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,440
 You tell me.

726
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,240
 They won't let you in because of the yakuza thing.

727
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,440
 So this website basically lists all of the onsens that you can go to and that will allow

728
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,440
 you in.

729
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,920
 Do you think the pork broth onsen would be one of those tattoo friendly ones?

730
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,920
 I think it might be.

731
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,920
 Yeah.

732
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,920
 This is amazing.

733
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,920
 This is...

734
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,920
 There's a place.

735
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,920
 Well, it's the pork broth hot tub.

736
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,080
 It's the Unison Spa.

737
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,880
 And they have a massive ramen bath, basically.

738
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,720
 And it's just slightly porky hot water.

739
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,720
 It sounds amazing.

740
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,720
 It's a noodles in there.

741
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,960
 Well, they dangle above you a huge sculpture that looks like a pair of tropsticks holding

742
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,960
 noodles.

743
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,360
 So it looks like you're about to be...

744
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,520
 It's like you're a soft boiled egg.

745
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,520
 It's like you're a...

746
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,520
 Yeah.

747
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:46,520
 And as you've seen my physique, that I am like a soft boiled egg, basically.

748
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,520
 But they've got a green tea bath.

749
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,600
 They've got a sake bath, which is very slightly sake.

750
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,400
 It's not obviously not all sake, because that'd be hugely expensive.

751
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,440
 They've got a coffee bath, which does not look appetising.

752
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,440
 Yeah.

753
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,440
 It looks really gross.

754
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,440
 It's...

755
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,080
 It's safe if you have the runs, isn't it?

756
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,080
 Oh, yes.

757
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,080
 Absolutely.

758
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,080
 Yeah.

759
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,080
 That sounds...

760
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,080
 I'd love to go there.

761
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,080
 It does look cool.

762
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,080
 Sounds awesome.

763
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,520
 I have been to Anonsan, a few, in fact, in Japan.

764
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,520
 Really?

765
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:19,880
 There's a thing in Japan called Hadakano Sukui, which means naked camaraderie.

766
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,720
 And the idea is everyone gets naked.

767
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,920
 You're all together in a big sort of jacuzzi with no bubbles.

768
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:30,120
 And it means you're all emotionally together, open, honest.

769
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,520
 That's the idea behind it.

770
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,040
 And I must admit, I went in, ran in, had a bath.

771
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,760
 I just came out and went back to my room as quickly as I could.

772
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,760
 Oh, right.

773
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,760
 You didn't have any...

774
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,760
 Not very communal for you then.

775
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,760
 I don't speak Japanese.

776
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,760
 But there are other ways of communicating then.

777
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,640
 Yeah, but naked charades are the best of times is difficult.

778
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,800
 I'm just a harkest back to the last fact.

779
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,800
 You know that Andrew Lloyd Webber has a 30-person hot tub.

780
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,800
 That's disgusting.

781
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,800
 Does he?

782
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:59,600
 So it's a 30-person hot tub, meaning everyone gets a slot on the outer wall.

783
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,600
 I believe.

784
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,600
 What's the alternative?

785
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:06,320
 That it could go a bus format where it is like six by four.

786
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,320
 Like, what's the...

787
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,320
 Yeah.

788
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,320
 What?

789
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,320
 There's an aisle down the middle.

790
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,760
 Tickets, please.

791
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,760
 Chicken of fish.

792
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,760
 Nuts.

793
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,760
 No, we don't have any.

794
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,760
 I can just concede.

795
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,760
 No, I don't...

796
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,760
 Yeah, I don't know what...

797
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,760
 Yeah, I don't know.

798
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,760
 I think it must be...

799
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,760
 Everyone gets a bit of wall.

800
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,760
 Otherwise, you're just popping about in the middle, feeling like a...

801
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,760
 Like a lemon, yeah.

802
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,760
 I hate that bit, yeah.

803
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,760
 Oh, yeah.

804
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,760
 Bobbing.

805
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:36,560
 Bob, in the Southern Island of Tremacutu, and it opened up, I think, in 2017.

806
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,720
 They'd announced it with big fanfare the year before.

807
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,440
 They said, "This is going to be a... actually, it wasn't a spa.

808
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,160
 It was a spa-themed amusement park."

809
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:50,840
 And they had released some images of, basically, a rollercoaster that's full of bath rollercoaster.

810
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,840
 Okay.

811
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,040
 What, you're in a little bath, and that's your...

812
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,040
 Yeah.

813
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,040
 You know you get in the carriage.

814
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,040
 Yeah.

815
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,040
 And it's a bath.

816
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,040
 Wow.

817
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,040
 And you're in a spa.

818
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,880
 So they were not sure at the time if it could be done.

819
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,880
 Yeah.

820
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,720
 It was, like, beyond the, the can of humanity, but they, they, they did it.

821
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:09,400
 So you're in a compartment that is a jacuzzi, basically?

822
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,760
 I think they didn't quite correct the full rollercoaster bath.

823
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,760
 Yeah.

824
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,560
 Because that would have been very heavy, obviously.

825
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,560
 It was spill a lot.

826
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,560
 It was spill a lot.

827
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,560
 Yeah.

828
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,560
 It's like an opposite log flume.

829
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,560
 Yeah.

830
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,560
 But water's in.

831
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,320
 If you're really unlucky, you'll be dry at the end of it.

832
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,320
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

833
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,320
 All the people waiting on the cycle.

834
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,320
 Oh, hang on.

835
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,320
 Yeah.

836
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,320
 Yeah.

837
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,320
 That's very interesting.

838
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,440
 There's another one, which I wonder if that's there as well, where you have an option of

839
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,600
 arriving and they bury you up to your neck and sand.

840
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:41,160
 And it's quite hot sand so that you can get whatever, you know, holistic therapy.

841
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:47,160
 So have you done, have you ever done any sort of odd pampering things like this?

842
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,640
 Um, that you're willing to admit too?

843
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,640
 Yeah.

844
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,080
 I was quite intrigued by the beer baths that you can do.

845
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,720
 You know, in Europe, in like the Czech Republic, like, there's a lot, they're quite popular

846
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,720
 now.

847
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:01,560
 Um, it's like bathing, like, hoppy water, a bit like your ramen.

848
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,560
 Right, right, right.

849
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,320
 I wonder if you'd be interested in this, uh, this thing in Japan.

850
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,960
 It's the Nightingale Fese's Facial.

851
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,640
 Now, it's not what it sounds like.

852
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,120
 It's Fese's from the Japanese Bushwabler, which is not a true Nightingale.

853
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,120
 Oh.

854
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,120
 Oh.

855
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,360
 Thank God.

856
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:23,760
 In Japanese, it's brilliantly called Uguisu No Fun.

857
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,760
 Right.

858
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:28,440
 And apparently anyone around you, because you stink of shit.

859
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,440
 Yeah.

860
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,680
 Apparently, Victoria Beckham is a proponent of it.

861
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,680
 Oh, yeah.

862
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,680
 Wow.

863
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,680
 Okay.

864
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,680
 That's extreme.

865
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:39,000
 I read about the, uh, the crying therapy rooms, which seems really nice.

866
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,680
 The whole idea is to make you a sad as you could possibly be.

867
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:46,680
 So you go in and you sit down and there's just sad movies playing on the screen and someone

868
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,280
 sits next to you, just going to ask really sad, isn't it?

869
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,000
 And then they hand you tissues as you're crying.

870
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,680
 Just me.

871
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,680
 Okay.

872
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,680
 Give that one some bigger.

873
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,680
 No, that sounds nice.

874
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,000
 So we've got to have a good cry.

875
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 Yeah.

876
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 Yeah.

877
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 Yeah.

878
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 Yeah, I'd buy that.

879
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 Just going back to Onsen.

880
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,840
 So these baths, would you eat an Onsen Tamago, which is a traditional Japanese egg, which

881
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,760
 is cooked in a Onsen?

882
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,960
 You put your egg in a rope net.

883
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:20,200
 You put it in the Onsen and the water is about 70 degrees and you leave it in for 30 to

884
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,320
 40 minutes.

885
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,320
 And then it's done.

886
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,320
 Question.

887
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,320
 Yeah.

888
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,560
 Because there are two ways of cooking eggs in water.

889
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,480
 Shell on and shell off.

890
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,520
 So are we, are we poaching this bear boy or are we?

891
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,600
 This is, I believe it's shell on, I think.

892
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,600
 Oh, fine.

893
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,600
 Shell on.

894
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,600
 Wow.

895
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,600
 There you go.

896
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,600
 The audience has spoken shell on.

897
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,600
 But shell on.

898
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,600
 In it.

899
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,600
 It can be in a bath.

900
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,320
 It's not just a water bath, like a battery, it's an actual Onsen.

901
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,320
 Yeah.

902
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,280
 But also the eggs have a unique silky custard texture.

903
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,280
 I bet they do.

904
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,280
 Yeah.

905
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,280
 I would eat that.

906
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,280
 I'm sorry.

907
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,160
 Can I just ask the person, was it a lady in the audience who said, "Chelon, have you

908
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,160
 had one of these?"

909
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,160
 They're really good.

910
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,160
 They're really good.

911
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,160
 There you go.

912
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,160
 Can't you?

913
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,160
 Like a poached egg.

914
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,760
 There's that like bit of white that never gets cooked and it's someone's like flamed

915
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,760
 on your plate.

916
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,760
 Oh, yeah.

917
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,760
 Yeah, yeah.

918
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,360
 It looks like a dementor in the in the water as it's boiling.

919
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,360
 I've never seen a poached egg that hasn't got it.

920
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,360
 Why do we put order this?

921
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,360
 It's foul.

922
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,360
 Oh, I love a poached egg.

923
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,360
 You do.

924
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,360
 Yeah.

925
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,360
 But they're just like, if it's in its wrapper, I don't mind where it's been.

926
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,360
 It's wrapped.

927
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:25,160
 I'd have a, I'd have a, if there was a banana, a banana in at the same time, pop that in

928
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,160
 the net.

929
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,160
 I don't mind.

930
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,160
 Yeah.

931
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,160
 Because it's been up her, up her chicken's bum, hasn't it?

932
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,160
 You're right.

933
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,160
 Let's not get fussy.

934
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,160
 You know.

935
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,800
 I wish I hadn't brought it up, I'll be honest.

936
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,800
 It's good.

937
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,680
 But I just want the other weird sparking.

938
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:42,760
 There was that bullseemon hair treatment, right?

939
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,760
 Okay.

940
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,360
 I don't need about this in Chelsea.

941
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,360
 No?

942
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,360
 In Chelsea?

943
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,360
 Yeah.

944
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,360
 Okay.

945
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,360
 It was a hair mask, basically, in like 2008, 2009.

946
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,360
 Hair mask?

947
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,360
 Yeah.

948
00:34:54,360 --> 00:35:00,360
 It was this place called Harry's Salon in Chelsea, and it offered a 45-minute Aberdeen organic

949
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:10,440
 hair treatment, which was Aberdeen Angus, like good quality, bull come stuff, which women

950
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:15,360
 would like, I don't know, I guess, would pay like a lot of money to have, like, lathered over

951
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,360
 their hair.

952
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,360
 Yep.

953
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,480
 And would just like sit with it for 45 minutes, and apparently it was amazing.

954
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,480
 Really?

955
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,960
 And it made their hair silky and smooth, and...

956
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,120
 But I have made head-in shoulders two in one shampoo and conditioner, and that makes

957
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,640
 my hair silky and smooth.

958
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:31,120
 Andy, are there levels of silkeness and smoothness that I've not matched yet?

959
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,120
 You haven't lived.

960
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:35,440
 I can imagine one of these women from Chelsea going into the countryside afterwards

961
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,960
 and walking through a field, and all the female cows are like, "Do you smell something?"

962
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,960
 Yeah.

963
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:49,120
 Well, it's funny to say that, because the people that ran this salon told the Metro a new

964
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,880
 story, these pervert fraudsters, yeah, it's gone.

965
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:57,640
 These quacks said to the Metro that the seamen is refrigerated before use and doesn't smell.

966
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,200
 I mean, it is come, but it's not, you know...

967
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,000
 It's not going to stay refrigerated.

968
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 That's the problem.

969
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,440
 The body heat is going to cause that to warm up.

970
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,200
 Yeah, but it's 45 minutes a minute.

971
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,000
 Look at, like, eating an egg from a buffoon of people, like, what do you mean?

972
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 Look at all.

973
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,400
 We do need to move on to our next factory, do we?

974
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,400
 No!

975
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,400
 Yeah, but we ran again.

976
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,400
 We didn't even touch...

977
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,400
 I've got the dreams of engineering stuff about how the Fukushima reactor dealt with its

978
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,800
 water after the terrible incident there.

979
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,800
 But I'll save it, I'll save it.

980
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,800
 You save it.

981
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,800
 It's fascinating.

982
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,800
 They built an underground wall with the ice.

983
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,800
 Oh, he's going for it.

984
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,800
 He's moving on.

985
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,400
 OK, we do need to move on.

986
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,600
 So it is time for fact number three.

987
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,600
 And that is...

988
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,600
 Oh, it's Andy.

989
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:50,880
 So, after the terrible incident at Fukushima, the engineers there pulled off a miracle, a miracle

990
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,400
 of preventing the radioactive.

991
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,400
 So they've got...

992
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,600
 Imagine a 1.5 kilometer radio circle.

993
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,600
 Oh!

994
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,200
 30 meters underground filled with frozen brine.

995
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,200
 Get off your phone!

996
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,200
 Come on!

997
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,000
 Help your phone!

998
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,800
 I can't start against shock of its 2 seconds.

999
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,800
 OK.

1000
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,800
 Anyway.

1001
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,800
 Sorry.

1002
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:15,480
 My fact is, the first named man who sent a letter bomb only invented it to get back at people

1003
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,040
 who had rejected all his other ideas for inventions.

1004
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,040
 So...

1005
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,040
 This is...

1006
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,040
 Very funny.

1007
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,040
 I love this guy.

1008
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,880
 He's a very interesting historical figure.

1009
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:30,160
 His name was Martin Eckenberg, and I was on the website of the Clapham Society, which

1010
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,800
 is a great website, all about Clapham, which is a part of South London where I used

1011
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,800
 to live.

1012
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:38,160
 He was a Swedish scientist, Martin Eckenberg, born in 1870.

1013
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:43,080
 He was kind of, he was gifted inventor in some ways.

1014
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:48,560
 His ideas were decent, but the other problem that he had, personally, was that he was a liar,

1015
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,560
 he was a cheat.

1016
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,760
 He claimed qualifications he didn't have.

1017
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:56,520
 He'd been kicked out of Sweden's Royal Institute of Technology, specifically for cheating.

1018
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,520
 He was a badden.

1019
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,520
 He was a badden.

1020
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,520
 He was a badden.

1021
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,520
 Fucking legend.

1022
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,520
 So...

1023
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,520
 Free thinker.

1024
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,080
 Outside the box, kind of a liar.

1025
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:08,120
 But still, this didn't hold him back that much, because he moved to one of the nicest houses

1026
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,120
 in Clapham.

1027
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,040
 It was this really beautiful mansion he moved to.

1028
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,080
 That's not the point of the fact.

1029
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:18,000
 It's been replaced by flats now, so you can't go and visit it, but if you would, that's

1030
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,600
 weird, and you should be on a terror list.

1031
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:24,560
 And then in 1905, if you thought, right, I'm going to get revenge on everyone who's turned

1032
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,200
 down my ideas along the way, who turned me down for finance.

1033
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,600
 I am going to get back at you, and he's so basically created, started making his own

1034
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,920
 letter bombs, and there were packages sent through the post to harm people before, but I think

1035
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,080
 he's the first name sort of, you know, like, prosecuted.

1036
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,560
 I think it was a bit unfair.

1037
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:44,160
 So like the first person that he really sent it to was a guy called London, who ran this

1038
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,160
 company.

1039
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:49,800
 It was like an engineering company, and Eckenberg had invented something that could turn

1040
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:55,120
 fish oil into engine oil, and he thought it was going to make his millions, but it failed.

1041
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,400
 And so he thought, well, I'm going to get this guy, London.

1042
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:01,800
 So the reason it failed is because the oil still smelled a fish.

1043
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,040
 So like if people put it in the cars, the cars smelled a fish.

1044
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,040
 Right.

1045
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,440
 I suppose if people are harries and get that sent removed, like the bullseamon.

1046
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,040
 Well, no, the ships that was going to be used on ships, which have fish, obviously.

1047
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,040
 That's true.

1048
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,440
 Heads of the phrase, fish and ships.

1049
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,840
 But yeah, that.

1050
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:23,360
 And then this guy, London, opens the packet, and it said, I read an article in the newspaper

1051
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:29,240
 that said, "It rumbled and shook like thunder." The director felt as if he had been hit by lightning

1052
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,320
 or tickled by lightning.

1053
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:36,000
 An intense flame burst out the box and burned his hands, arms, chest and face terribly.

1054
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,480
 And his clothes went on fire.

1055
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:42,080
 And the next day he got a postcard saying, "A former employee has decided that you're ripe

1056
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,080
 for the picking."

1057
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,080
 Yes.

1058
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,840
 What's interesting is that it's not as if he sent it from the post in the UK, which would

1059
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,240
 be more traceable.

1060
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:54,320
 He went by boat, back to Sweden, he assembled it there, sent it there and then went back home.

1061
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,960
 So he really covered up his tracks.

1062
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:00,440
 But then he still set a postcard with his writing identifiable on it to the person he'd

1063
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,440
 just...

1064
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,440
 Yeah.

1065
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,680
 I mean, he was caught for various quite stupid things like that.

1066
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,680
 Yeah.

1067
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,080
 Can I just rescind that I thought he was good?

1068
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,080
 No, no.

1069
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:13,080
 There's another thing as well, James, see if you still think he's good.

1070
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:18,440
 So when he was arrested, he claimed innocence, and then he, according to the New York Times,

1071
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:21,640
 he lost his reason and was taken to an asylum.

1072
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:27,520
 He died two months later, after his arrest, of what they said was apoplexy.

1073
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:32,080
 But the head of the Swedish detective service said that if he'd been sent back to Sweden,

1074
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:35,240
 he would have also been tried for murdering his two wives.

1075
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,240
 Oh.

1076
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,240
 Right.

1077
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,240
 Yeah.

1078
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,240
 No.

1079
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,240
 Are you feeling sorry about that?

1080
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,720
 Let's get a live reaction from Jamie Morden sitting right here.

1081
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,720
 Sounds fine.

1082
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,720
 Yeah.

1083
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,720
 Not too sure.

1084
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:50,600
 What appears to have happened is he poisoned his first two wives, and then he bribed the

1085
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:54,440
 prison guards to get him the same poison which he then took himself.

1086
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,440
 Yeah.

1087
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,440
 Yeah.

1088
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:01,600
 And interestingly today, if you go to the police museum and stock home, there's a giant wax

1089
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:07,640
 work, like a replica, human-sized wax replica of him standing there, and not only that, they

1090
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,760
 have a bunch of things that were to do with the case.

1091
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,920
 So one of the bombings, which was sent to the Swedish Export Society, was opened up by

1092
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,400
 a man called John Hammer, and John Hammer's thumb was blown off as part of opening the

1093
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,400
 scene.

1094
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:23,320
 And if you go to the police museum and stock home, you can see the wax work of Morden Eckenberg,

1095
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:26,560
 and then you can see the actual thumb of John Hammer.

1096
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,560
 Thumbs up or thumbs down.

1097
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,560
 It's the...

1098
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,560
 Yeah.

1099
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,560
 It wasn't happy.

1100
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,560
 It's a definite thumbs down for me.

1101
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,560
 Yeah.

1102
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,560
 So it's very, very grim guy.

1103
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,680
 But it was an innovator of sorts.

1104
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:39,600
 And as I say, people had been sending devices designed to hurt other people through the

1105
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,160
 post for ages, you know.

1106
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:45,080
 So the very first one was a thing called the band box plot.

1107
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:49,780
 People were very worried about the week party in the, I think, 18th century, and supposedly

1108
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:53,360
 that party were involved in some attempts to assassinate people.

1109
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,360
 Get this.

1110
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:58,360
 The very first ever thing sent through the post designed to harm someone, this band box plot,

1111
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:02,360
 was a box full of, I think, there's three pistols, but when you open it, they all go off

1112
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,360
 at you.

1113
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,360
 Wow.

1114
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,360
 I know.

1115
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,360
 And it was...

1116
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,360
 Oh, my God.

1117
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,200
 This is the story that it was thwarted by Jonathan Swift.

1118
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:15,080
 Well, the author of the travels, because he was a political figure as well, and he supposedly

1119
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:19,280
 noticed a thread on the box and cut it before opening it.

1120
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:24,640
 Oh, so he's the first red wire blue wire cut moment that we've ever had for a bomb.

1121
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,640
 Yeah.

1122
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,640
 Pretty cool.

1123
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,680
 And we talk about his books instead.

1124
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,680
 No, yeah.

1125
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:32,960
 But Eckenberg was the first of a kind of new wave where Gump Outer had been invented.

1126
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,760
 The post had improved things like that.

1127
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:38,640
 And so there were anarchists, people very, very worried about anarchists with their kind

1128
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,880
 of cartoon-style bombs that they'd be throwing.

1129
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:41,880
 Yeah.

1130
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:46,600
 And he also invented a way to freeze dry milk, which is kind of similar to what we have today.

1131
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,960
 So like, you know, instant custard, we wouldn't have it without him.

1132
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:50,960
 Really?

1133
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:51,960
 Well, Eckenberg.

1134
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:52,960
 Wow.

1135
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,960
 Jamie, you want to change your...

1136
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,480
 Because you're going off him, but I know you don't mind custard, do you know?

1137
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,480
 You don't have a bit of custard.

1138
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,480
 I mean, you know, I'm...

1139
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,480
 Because of 50/50.

1140
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,480
 It requires people.

1141
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:05,120
 I'll tell you why I think he's not a complete villain.

1142
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:11,720
 So interesting, which Hills people choose to die on.

1143
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:12,960
 I find that really fascinating.

1144
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:17,920
 I just kind of love the fact that like through revenge he invented something that was actually,

1145
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,040
 I mean, not a good thing, but was like a thing.

1146
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:25,360
 This silver lining is slimming down all the time.

1147
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,360
 I got to say.

1148
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:29,640
 So it was for revenge, but he did invent something really bad.

1149
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:35,640
 Well, maybe this is how my mind works. I mean, I got quite heavily into revenge during my

1150
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,720
 researching of this.

1151
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,920
 So I was like, what else has revenge kind of created?

1152
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:44,040
 And the rotary telephone is one thing that revenge has created.

1153
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,040
 Yeah.

1154
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:51,480
 Because there was a guy called Alman Stroudger, and he was an undertaker in the late 19th century

1155
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,480
 in Kansas City.

1156
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,880
 They were all manual switchboards at that point, obviously.

1157
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:02,200
 And he thought that the switchboard operators were deliberately fiddling with his connections,

1158
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,200
 because--

1159
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:07,720
 Wait, so you would call up and say, patch me through to this person, right?

1160
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:14,240
 And he was convinced that this was being meddled with, because the other undertakers across

1161
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:20,120
 the town, I think their wife worked at the phone company, so someone dies, you put them

1162
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,120
 through to--

1163
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,120
 Right.

1164
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,120
 To the rival.

1165
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,120
 And yeah, exactly.

1166
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,120
 So they were getting all the work.

1167
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,640
 So what's going on here?

1168
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:30,960
 And so he invented the rotary telephone to cut out the--

1169
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,480
 What's the one where you dial with it?

1170
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,480
 Yeah, so you could dial it yourself.

1171
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,480
 That is amazing.

1172
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,480
 That's great.

1173
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,480
 It's not amazing.

1174
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,480
 Right.

1175
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,480
 Revenge.

1176
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,480
 But not all bad.

1177
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,480
 Okay.

1178
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,480
 It's like those spite houses.

1179
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,480
 You know, spite houses.

1180
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,200
 And it's just so cool that something that you build to screw someone over ends up being

1181
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,720
 worth more than the house that--

1182
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:48,720
 Yeah, exactly.

1183
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:49,720
 Yeah, exactly.

1184
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:50,880
 I just love stuff like that.

1185
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:55,800
 Just jumping back to Letterbombs for a second, I've discovered that the former prime minister--

1186
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:59,200
 well, a very long former prime minister, Anthony Eden.

1187
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,200
 So prime minister of England, he was almost killed by Letterbombs.

1188
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,200
 Is that so?

1189
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,200
 Yeah.

1190
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,200
 And this was prior to him being prime minister.

1191
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:12,320
 It was when he was foreign secretary, and someone had hand-delivered a Letterbombs.

1192
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:15,280
 He took it, but he thought, ah, this looks a bit boring.

1193
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:19,120
 So he put it in his briefcase, and he had it for 24 hours.

1194
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:20,120
 He went home.

1195
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,120
 He didn't open it.

1196
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,360
 He just had a whole day of not opening it.

1197
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,360
 And then Scotland got--

1198
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:25,360
 A letter looked boring.

1199
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,680
 Yeah, he thought it looked like a circular, like it looked like something that might have been

1200
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:28,680
 dropped off.

1201
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:29,680
 Oh, yeah.

1202
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:30,680
 And it was a generic thing.

1203
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:31,680
 Yeah.

1204
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:35,080
 And so then Scotland Yard got in contact and said, we're worried that something might have

1205
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,960
 been sent to you that is a bomb.

1206
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,680
 And he still didn't look at it.

1207
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:42,960
 And it was his secretary who eventually went, that might be a bomb, and then--

1208
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:43,960
 And it was.

1209
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:47,600
 And so it was just purely his absolute boredom towards this letter that--

1210
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:51,320
 Because that was an interesting letter he ever received.

1211
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:55,000
 And that's the thing is, they're designed to go off when you open them, aren't they?

1212
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,520
 So you can carry them around.

1213
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,520
 Yeah.

1214
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,520
 And it's fine.

1215
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:03,160
 So, for instance, you're told that if you work in a government office and they might

1216
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:06,720
 happen, a lot of people, when they get a letter that they're not sure about, they put

1217
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:07,720
 it in water.

1218
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:10,200
 Because they think that's what you're supposed to do with a bomb, but you're absolutely not

1219
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,200
 supposed to put it in water.

1220
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,320
 Because some of the explosives will explode if you put them in a big--

1221
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,320
 Is that so?

1222
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:18,120
 I also renders the letter completely illegible.

1223
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,120
 Exactly.

1224
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:21,920
 I've got stupid idea.

1225
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:22,920
 There are some tips.

1226
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:23,920
 There are some useful tips, actually.

1227
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:29,000
 So warning signs include, excess postage.

1228
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,760
 Like, why is someone spending so much money on their parcel?

1229
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,640
 Because you don't want to risk it getting returned to you, do you?

1230
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,200
 Right.

1231
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,480
 No return address.

1232
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:42,880
 So the really clever bombers will leave the return address off.

1233
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:47,480
 I think I would put the return address as my number two nemesis.

1234
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,480
 Yeah, nice.

1235
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,480
 Such a good idea.

1236
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,480
 Yeah.

1237
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,480
 Such a good idea.

1238
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,480
 Number two.

1239
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,480
 What have you got?

1240
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,480
 It's a long old list.

1241
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,480
 He's doing this.

1242
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:58,480
 He's doing this.

1243
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,480
 Bad spelling.

1244
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:00,480
 Oh.

1245
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,480
 Because a lot of-- I mean, a lot of people sending these things are not the-- maybe.

1246
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,080
 I'm going to say, like, off letter bombs.

1247
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,480
 They're not the brightest buttons.

1248
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,480
 Really?

1249
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:08,480
 Yeah, bad spelling.

1250
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,480
 Because they've just constructed a bomb.

1251
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,480
 It feels like you've got a basic--

1252
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,080
 Get one.

1253
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:13,880
 What are you doing?

1254
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:17,080
 They might have studied the sciences and not the humanities.

1255
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,280
 Yes, that's the point.

1256
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:20,080
 There are so many kinds of intelligence.

1257
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:26,680
 Addressed personal, confidential, or do not x-ray.

1258
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:31,680
 That's wrong.

1259
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,480
 And the final one, just for any of that have slipped through those many holes

1260
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:40,080
 in the Swiss cheese, ticking sounds, protruding wires.

1261
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,080
 OK, yeah.

1262
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,080
 Or aluminium foil.

1263
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:44,880
 Or if it says "acme bomb" on the front.

1264
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:50,080
 If it's dropped off by a coyote who looks pleased with himself, that's another one.

1265
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:51,080
 I did read.

1266
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:54,880
 There was a-- what's the name of the journalist, Slasov Zizek?

1267
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:55,880
 Slasov Zizek.

1268
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:58,680
 Yeah, so he wrote this piece.

1269
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:01,880
 And the opening anecdote of the piece at the top winner in the contest

1270
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:05,880
 for the greatest blunder of 1998 was a Latin American patriotic terrorist

1271
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:09,680
 who sent a letter bomb to a US consulate in order to protest against America

1272
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,680
 interfering local politics.

1273
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,880
 As a conscientious citizen, he wrote his return address on the envelope.

1274
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,280
 However, he did not put enough stamps on it.

1275
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,680
 So that post was returned to him, forgetting he'd put it in.

1276
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,080
 He opened it and blew himself up.

1277
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,880
 He did, and he did what James said.

1278
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:23,880
 Yeah.

1279
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:26,280
 Now, who knows if that's apocryphal, but it's--

1280
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:26,880
 What's his name?

1281
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,880
 All the fingerprints of Jack Waz, anyway, near this.

1282
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:35,080
 I'll tell you what, that's the first time Jack Waz and Slasov Zizek

1283
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:37,080
 have been mentioned in the same sentence together.

1284
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:41,080
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

1285
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:48,080
 It is time for our final fact of the show, and that is James.

1286
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:52,880
 OK, my fact this week is that there is currently a scandal in Thailand

1287
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,480
 after at least a dozen supposedly celibate monks

1288
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,680
 admitted to having sex with a woman called Mrs. Golf.

1289
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:04,480
 James, you're a keen golfer.

1290
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,480
 That's how I found this.

1291
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,280
 I was googling gol.

1292
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,680
 No, no, no.

1293
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:14,480
 No, I just read this in the news, and I thought it's very amusing.

1294
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,440
 It is a lot of senior monks.

1295
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,680
 I mean, not amusing, if you're a monk,

1296
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:21,440
 because obviously a lot of them have lost their livelihoods,

1297
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,680
 including some as high ranking as frat dep,

1298
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,760
 which means angelic level.

1299
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:29,280
 So this goes to the very, very top.

1300
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,600
 And it turns out they've been having relationships

1301
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,880
 with this woman, who's called Mrs. Golf,

1302
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,200
 and they've been transferring money to her.

1303
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:39,000
 And they've found this lady, and they've found

1304
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,800
 over 80,000 photos of naked monks on her phone.

1305
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,440
 How do they know they're monks?

1306
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,160
 [LAUGHTER]

1307
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,920
 Sorry to quibble.

1308
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:51,240
 I reckon there's a way.

1309
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,240
 You reckon there's a way?

1310
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:52,760
 It's probably a way.

1311
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:53,880
 I reckon there's a way.

1312
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:55,840
 Probably it's the hair style down there.

1313
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:56,840
 It's like a tontia.

1314
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:59,800
 It's like a tontia.

1315
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:00,800
 80,000 is a lot.

1316
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,800
 Not necessarily all different monks.

1317
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,240
 They could have been--

1318
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,760
 I don't even know if I have that amount of storage on my phone

1319
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:07,520
 for 80,000 photos.

1320
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:08,720
 Yes, what was her data plan like?

1321
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,760
 This is really interesting.

1322
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:11,720
 Is she in the cloud?

1323
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,200
 She's using the cloud.

1324
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,960
 So yeah, and the reason she's called Mrs. Golf

1325
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:18,440
 is because this is like common in Thailand

1326
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:21,000
 for people to have little short nicknames.

1327
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,440
 And you're kind of given them as a child by your parents.

1328
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:26,560
 And they don't really mean anything.

1329
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,920
 It might be that this person's parents love golf,

1330
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:33,480
 but more likely, they just take a Western word that kind

1331
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,400
 of sounds fun or trendy or whatever.

1332
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,640
 And they just call that.

1333
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:39,120
 The most famous Thai person in the world probably

1334
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,520
 is Lisa from Blackpink.

1335
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,440
 And her nickname is Pockpack.

1336
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:46,440
 Lisa from Blackpink, the band.

1337
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:47,680
 So it's just like--

1338
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,960
 [LAUGHTER]

1339
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,840
 James, earlier in the show, I thought Taylor Swift

1340
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,160
 was getting married to Kelsey Grammar.

1341
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:58,480
 So let's just modulate--

1342
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,400
 like, what we think I'm going to know.

1343
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:04,320
 So they're just--

1344
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:06,560
 mostly just sounds, or they might be little words

1345
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:09,320
 from other languages, but it's just like a little nickname.

1346
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,960
 But people go by it in real life.

1347
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,320
 Like, as adults, you might still be known as that nickname.

1348
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,320
 Yeah.

1349
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:17,920
 But so this is an unbelievably fascinating story.

1350
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:22,200
 This one woman went around so many of these different monasteries

1351
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,680
 and managed to talk in what were effectively--

1352
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,400
 I'm assuming, celibate monks--

1353
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:30,640
 into engaging, not only in sex, but also having photos taken.

1354
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,280
 And the top monks, some of them, have fled the country.

1355
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,600
 We don't know quite where they are.

1356
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,480
 And they haven't said why they've done that.

1357
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:40,640
 They're now investigating 300,000 other Buddhist monks

1358
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:43,240
 in Thailand off the back of this to see whether or not

1359
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:43,960
 they're involved.

1360
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:46,640
 And she got a lot of money off the back of this.

1361
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,240
 Was her own extortion?

1362
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,680
 Sort of, I'll release the photos.

1363
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,200
 So the photos would be shown back to them,

1364
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,400
 and then they would have to pay money.

1365
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,320
 And a lot of the monks have been acquitted

1366
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:57,040
 where the police have decided that actually you just

1367
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,960
 gave her money because she was pleading for the money

1368
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:02,200
 and didn't engage in sexual activity.

1369
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:02,720
 And trust me.

1370
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,760
 But you know how much money, allegedly,

1371
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:11,160
 she has netted the equivalent of $11.9 million from this.

1372
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:12,960
 There's a lot of money in munking, isn't there?

1373
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,320
 Isn't there?

1374
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,760
 Yeah, that's a bigger career than I thought.

1375
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:20,280
 Like, no, my career advisor did not say,

1376
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,080
 have you considered becoming a monk?

1377
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,560
 And I think it's quite a big deal.

1378
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:26,680
 In Thailand, because if you're a Buddhist,

1379
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,680
 you think that if someone becomes a monk,

1380
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,680
 then they kind of automatically sort of

1381
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:34,040
 develop this strong resistance to temptation

1382
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,240
 and that kind of thing.

1383
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:37,000
 And so to find out that they haven't

1384
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,080
 was quite a big deal for a lot of people.

1385
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:39,840
 Yeah.

1386
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:41,240
 I think this is very interesting, because I

1387
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:44,120
 started reading about, by the way, James,

1388
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,960
 there's a very hard factor, Google, like naughty monks.

1389
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:50,400
 And naughty nuns is actually even worse.

1390
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,320
 It's an even harder legit Google.

1391
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:56,920
 But basically, there was a lot of this in the 16th century

1392
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:01,800
 in England, because monks and nuns and monasteries and nunneries

1393
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,600
 were seen as hoppets of sin.

1394
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,680
 And the idea was they're all on the take.

1395
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:09,120
 They're all selling, pardoning for sins, that kind of thing.

1396
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:11,520
 Like, they're all, and they're all shacking up.

1397
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,920
 And there were some institutions--

1398
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:14,160
 Cancer Reformation.

1399
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,200
 Cancer Reformation, right.

1400
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,960
 But I think we've all been conned into thinking

1401
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,800
 that monks and nuns are inherently sort of naughty figures,

1402
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,280
 because they're absolutely not.

1403
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:25,400
 And I think we fall off a Henry VIII era propaganda.

1404
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,560
 And I'm blowing the lid off this.

1405
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:30,360
 Not enough people talk about it, but I'm not afraid to.

1406
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:33,280
 I'd just like to reference the paper by Christian Knudsen,

1407
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,960
 Sodomitic monks and other dissolution myths,

1408
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:38,760
 the late medieval monastic decline narrative revisited.

1409
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:39,960
 And it is a belting read.

1410
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,200
 It's really good.

1411
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,440
 And it's-- can you tell us more about the Fukushima

1412
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:43,920
 disaster?

1413
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,360
 But like, Henry VIII wanted to dissolve the monasteries.

1414
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:57,080
 Because they owned a huge proportion of English land.

1415
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:58,560
 There was so wealthy.

1416
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,800
 And Henry VIII thought I'm going to discredit

1417
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,320
 ecclesiastical institutions any way I can.

1418
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:06,880
 And every monastery in England, in 1535 and '65,

1419
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,320
 got a visit from bureaucrats who were trying to record

1420
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:12,720
 every dubious incidence of behavior by a monk or a nun

1421
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:13,640
 they could.

1422
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,320
 And there were some cases--

1423
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:16,400
 absolutely, there were some cases

1424
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,880
 where monks had been playing the field or whatever it is.

1425
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,600
 But they also-- they had to come up with new crimes.

1426
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:22,960
 So they found dozens of instances

1427
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,600
 recorded of voluntary pollution, which

1428
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:26,920
 is just sort of playing with yourself.

1429
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:31,840
 But it's not-- in one priori, West Acres, 76% of the monks

1430
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:33,720
 were labeled incontinent by which they mean

1431
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:36,320
 romantically incontinent.

1432
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,440
 But 10 of those 13 were for just enjoying

1433
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,480
 some sort of cowl billiards.

1434
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,680
 And so it's not cow-- the cow goes in your head, doesn't it?

1435
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,040
 You know what I mean?

1436
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:45,720
 Hardly ever.

1437
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:49,240
 [LAUGHTER]

1438
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:50,520
 I just think it's really interesting.

1439
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,080
 And I think we shouldn't fall for it.

1440
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,320
 OK, well, we won't.

1441
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:56,560
 [LAUGHTER]

1442
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,000
 But also, I'm a Catholic.

1443
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,600
 I mean, you know, lapsed Catholic.

1444
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,080
 Like, you can do anything if you say sorry.

1445
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:02,320
 That's like the point.

1446
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:03,160
 Yes.

1447
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:04,600
 But actually--

1448
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:07,680
 The penance was quite severe, where it could be.

1449
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:11,480
 So Richard Gray, one man called Richard Gray in Medieval England,

1450
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:13,840
 he was found guilty of having sex with a nun.

1451
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:16,200
 And he was sentenced to being flogged while walking

1452
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:19,320
 around Stanford Church on four Sundays in a row,

1453
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:23,040
 carrying a candle while dressed only in linen garments.

1454
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:25,640
 And then he had to make a barefoot pilgrimage

1455
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:28,560
 to Lincoln Cathedral, from where?

1456
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:31,000
 Wherever he lived.

1457
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,400
 Wow, that's a movable feast of a punishment, isn't it?

1458
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,640
 I just want to feed you all right.

1459
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,680
 I'm going to get a flat just outside Lincoln.

1460
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,960
 [LAUGHTER]

1461
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,400
 Yeah, that was quite a mess for me to not say

1462
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,840
 where he actually lived in my notes.

1463
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:47,040
 But then--

1464
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:50,200
 And then after that, he didn't do what he was supposed to do,

1465
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,200
 and they've excommunicated him.

1466
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:53,800
 But in those days, being excommunicated

1467
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:54,880
 was a big, old deal.

1468
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:55,880
 Right.

1469
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:57,560
 Because it means you can't go to heaven,

1470
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:59,440
 but also means you can't be baptized.

1471
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,520
 Means you can't get married.

1472
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:03,080
 You can't do all sorts of different things.

1473
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:04,480
 Yeah, and actually, quite often,

1474
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,240
 the women were punished more than the men.

1475
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:09,280
 So two that happened quite close to each other,

1476
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,840
 a guy called Nicholas Plymouth, was a monk who

1477
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,760
 has committed adultery with a Tanner's wife.

1478
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:19,080
 And he was ordered to remain silent for one week.

1479
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:20,880
 And around the same time, someone

1480
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,840
 called Alice Longspray was sentenced

1481
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:26,120
 to a year of strict confinement after an affair

1482
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:26,840
 with a priest.

1483
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:27,840
 It's double standards.

1484
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:29,240
 So it is double standards, yeah.

1485
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:29,760
 Yeah.

1486
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,240
 James, you've spent time in Bhutan.

1487
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:32,800
 I have.

1488
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,800
 Did you ever hear of the thunderbolt of flaming wisdom

1489
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:36,960
 while you were out there?

1490
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,560
 That's what they still call me, then.

1491
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:41,520
 [LAUGHTER]

1492
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,680
 I wonder when the thunderbolt of flaming wisdom

1493
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:46,440
 is going to return.

1494
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:51,400
 So it's referring to amongst penis,

1495
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:51,960
 but--

1496
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:56,800
 [LAUGHTER]

1497
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:00,000
 So a question who your real friends were out there.

1498
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,040
 But it was strange that they yelled at me at the streets.

1499
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:06,720
 [LAUGHTER]

1500
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:07,320
 Is that right?

1501
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:11,080
 There was this guy, Druckper Cunley, and he was in the 1400s.

1502
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:12,360
 Yeah, I'd been to his church.

1503
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:13,520
 You've been to his church.

1504
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,120
 So he was interesting, because he

1505
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:18,120
 was known as the Saint of 5,000 women.

1506
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:20,080
 He was a fertility saint.

1507
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:21,640
 The idea was he thought sex should

1508
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:24,280
 be incorporated into reaching enlightenment.

1509
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:25,120
 And so--

1510
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:25,920
 Oh, right.

1511
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,360
 So classic.

1512
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:27,880
 Oh, yeah.

1513
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:30,280
 Yeah, you would meet the thunderbolt of flaming wisdom

1514
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,320
 as part of your hello to him, basically.

1515
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:37,440
 And he was liked, but mad as fuck.

1516
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,760
 Like, people genuinely thought he was.

1517
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:40,280
 And what I--

1518
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:42,160
 It's known as like the Holy Mad Man or something like that.

1519
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:42,680
 Yeah.

1520
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:44,480
 And he introduced this idea, which still

1521
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,720
 goes on in various bits of Bhutan today,

1522
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,960
 which is that if you're setting up a new house

1523
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,320
 and you need it to be blessed, you would basically

1524
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:54,440
 graffiti, fallists, put dig picks, all over--

1525
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:56,520
 like draw a penis, all over the walls.

1526
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:57,240
 Did you see any--

1527
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:00,080
 Well, yeah, yeah, they're on every house, has them.

1528
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:00,600
 Yeah.

1529
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,920
 In this particular town where he was from.

1530
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:05,120
 And also, if you go into his church,

1531
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,680
 priest comes up to you with a giant fallace

1532
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,400
 and sort of touches you as if you'd

1533
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:11,200
 been knighted by the queen.

1534
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,320
 Rise.

1535
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:13,080
 Did you have that?

1536
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:13,600
 Yeah.

1537
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:14,200
 Wow.

1538
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:14,680
 Cool.

1539
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:15,200
 Arise.

1540
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:20,480
 If it's on every house, can you put it on a semi?

1541
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:21,000
 Sorry.

1542
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:21,520
 Go on.

1543
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:25,240
 Well, so it's pretty fascinating.

1544
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:27,160
 It sounds like modern Bhutan really

1545
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:29,320
 is for the people who are less connected to that,

1546
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:32,600
 slightly embarrassed by the fact that penises are everywhere.

1547
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:35,000
 I'll be honest, they take every tourist there.

1548
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:35,600
 Right, OK.

1549
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:38,680
 Because it is, like, it's Instagram central, you know,

1550
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:40,760
 like lots of houses with penises on them.

1551
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:41,760
 Yeah, interesting.

1552
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:42,080
 Yeah.

1553
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:44,720
 But I did also play golf with my monks.

1554
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,400
 So I say my monks, like, the monks take you around

1555
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,400
 the same time.

1556
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,640
 You're not allowed to just walk around.

1557
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:51,680
 They give you a couple of monks who kind of take you

1558
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:52,640
 everywhere.

1559
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:53,960
 And I asked if I could play golf.

1560
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:55,480
 And apparently, no one really asked that.

1561
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:56,840
 But I was in the Himalayas, so they

1562
00:58:56,840 --> 00:59:00,120
 has really thin, so the ball goes miles.

1563
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,640
 Oh, but if you get it wrong.

1564
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:02,640
 Surely.

1565
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:03,160
 Yeah.

1566
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:04,440
 And also today, I've learned that I

1567
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:08,760
 got a very high dose of radiation that day.

1568
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:11,640
 And then I did karaoke with them, as well, with the monks.

1569
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:14,360
 Like, all the monks came together in a bar in the evening.

1570
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:15,480
 And they went with them.

1571
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:16,920
 And we-- and sang karaoke.

1572
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,240
 What was that go-to song?

1573
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:19,240
 Come on, come on.

1574
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:22,000
 I sang it in Bhutanese, so I didn't really understand it.

1575
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,040
 What did they sing?

1576
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:25,040
 They were all the songs were in Bhutanese.

1577
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:25,840
 I will survive.

1578
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:26,640
 Got to be I will survive.

1579
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:27,640
 Yeah.

1580
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:28,640
 Yeah.

1581
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:30,880
 Do you want to know something cool about the first century

1582
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:31,880
 St. Thecla?

1583
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:32,880
 Yes, please.

1584
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:33,880
 Yes, please.

1585
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:34,880
 This was sent in by a listener, actually.

1586
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:35,880
 Listen to Kat Brinker.

1587
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:36,880
 So thanks Kat for this.

1588
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,160
 This is the first century St. Thecla.

1589
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:43,000
 She is the unofficial patron saint of computers and the internet.

1590
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
 Can you work out why?

1591
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,360
 It's going to be sex-connected, presumably.

1592
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:47,360
 Nope.

1593
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:48,360
 [LAUGHTER]

1594
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:50,360
 But you said it was to do with the internet.

1595
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:51,360
 No, I know.

1596
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:52,360
 I know.

1597
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:54,360
 What did the first century monk have to do with computers

1598
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:55,360
 and the internet?

1599
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:56,360
 She liked cats.

1600
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:58,160
 That's a really good one.

1601
00:59:58,160 --> 00:59:59,400
 That's very close.

1602
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,680
 She was very racist all the time.

1603
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:02,680
 No.

1604
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:03,680
 [LAUGHTER]

1605
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:10,120
 It's because her name Thecla sounds like the Spanish word for a key on a keyboard.

1606
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:11,120
 Thecla.

1607
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:12,120
 Oh, OK.

1608
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:13,120
 Thecla.

1609
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:14,120
 You've not just wasted their time.

1610
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,120
 [LAUGHTER]

1611
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:16,120
 Unbelievable.

1612
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:25,120
 If you'd like to know some other grabs of the word Thecla, I've got loads.

1613
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:29,680
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

1614
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:30,600
 We've got to wrap up.

1615
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:31,760
 We need to wrap up our show.

1616
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:32,600
 What is for the shame?

1617
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:37,040
 [LAUGHTER]

1618
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:41,960
 However, before we wrap up tonight, so we've got one last thing to do, which is our brilliant

1619
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:46,400
 giant sperm donor over there is going to come on stage.

1620
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,400
 You could have quit.

1621
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:49,440
 It's going to arrive on stage.

1622
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:56,440
 And, James, you're going to be hosting a quiz, right?

1623
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:57,200
 Yes, I am.

1624
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,680
 Yes, so is it James as well?

1625
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:00,880
 Come on up, James.

1626
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:03,680
 What we're going to do is we're going to do a little quiz and we're going to put you up

1627
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,520
 against Jamie Martin.

1628
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,880
 How well do you know those things are fish, James?

1629
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:08,760
 Very well, yeah.

1630
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:10,320
 Yes, Jamie?

1631
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:11,120
 Not at all.

1632
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:13,280
 [LAUGHTER]

1633
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:18,000
 Well, I've been on it three times, three or four times, and that's it.

1634
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,080
 OK.

1635
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:22,560
 These questions will not refer to any time you were on the show, Jamie.

1636
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:26,200
 But I do know you guys, so in theory, it should balance out.

1637
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:30,320
 Absolutely, because the quiz is going to be things that we have mentioned about ourselves

1638
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:31,640
 on the podcast.

1639
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:36,920
 I'm going to say a statement that one of us has said, and it's up to you to decide which

1640
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:37,920
 of us said it.

1641
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:40,760
 Now, Jamie, if you don't remember our names, just point at us.

1642
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:41,760
 Great.

1643
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:42,760
 OK.

1644
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:43,760
 The guy in the hat.

1645
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:44,760
 Can I confer?

1646
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:45,760
 No.

1647
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:46,760
 Because Dan will--

1648
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:47,760
 No.

1649
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:49,080
 [LAUGHTER]

1650
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,480
 Dan knows it's so less than me.

1651
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:54,800
 So what we're going to do is we're going to do three questions, because one of the questions

1652
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:58,240
 I have is something that we've just mentioned on the podcast today.

1653
01:01:58,240 --> 01:01:59,480
 So I can't do that one.

1654
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:00,760
 We'll do three each.

1655
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:02,160
 Hopefully it won't be a tie.

1656
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:03,800
 That's all I could say.

1657
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:06,840
 So first of all, this is to you, James.

1658
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:07,520
 OK.

1659
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:09,920
 Which of us, on those six fingers of fish, it can't be Anna.

1660
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:11,520
 It's going to be me and the Ordan.

1661
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:16,080
 Which of us said, I slept in a church for a fortnight?

1662
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:16,840
 James.

1663
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:17,840
 Me?

1664
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:18,840
 Yeah.

1665
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:19,840
 It was not me.

1666
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:21,800
 Dan, was it you?

1667
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,840
 I don't think so.

1668
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:24,840
 [LAUGHTER]

1669
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:27,920
 I really hope this is you and the otherwise the whole quiz has gone to shit.

1670
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:28,920
 But, was it you?

1671
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:29,920
 Yeah, I think it was.

1672
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:30,920
 Yeah.

1673
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:31,920
 It was me.

1674
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:32,920
 It was Andy.

1675
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:33,920
 Yeah, yeah.

1676
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:34,920
 You think it was--

1677
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:35,920
 [LAUGHTER]

1678
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:36,920
 Something you'd remember.

1679
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:37,920
 It was me.

1680
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:38,920
 It was me.

1681
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:39,920
 Two weeks, living in a church.

1682
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:40,920
 Not living.

1683
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:41,920
 Sleeping?

1684
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:42,920
 Sleeping?

1685
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:43,920
 Right.

1686
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:44,920
 You're resting?

1687
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:45,920
 Yeah.

1688
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:46,920
 It was a charity thing.

1689
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:47,920
 It was fun.

1690
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:48,920
 Yeah.

1691
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:49,920
 memorable.

1692
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:50,920
 Cool.

1693
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:54,920
 He's got 80,000 photos of the priest to prove it.

1694
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:57,920
 So, Andy, are you going to do the scars for us?

1695
01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:59,920
 I have to keep score and hold a microphone in one hand.

1696
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:00,920
 I'm not sure I can.

1697
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:02,920
 Did anybody got that one?

1698
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:03,920
 OK, so the score is?

1699
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:04,920
 Love all.

1700
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:05,920
 Great.

1701
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:06,920
 Yep.

1702
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:07,920
 OK, question number two.

1703
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:08,920
 This is for Jamie.

1704
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:09,920
 Which of us said this?

1705
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:14,920
 Before I moved to London, I was heavily involved in the hedge community.

1706
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:18,920
 Which was, was into hedges.

1707
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:19,920
 Hedge community.

1708
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:20,920
 Yeah.

1709
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:23,920
 Do I look like a man who's into hedges?

1710
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:25,920
 I'm going to be honest and say you do.

1711
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:28,920
 [LAUGHTER]

1712
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:31,920
 But what a lovely pastime.

1713
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,920
 Just to make it fair, I'll say Andy.

1714
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:37,920
 Andy, have you ever not lived in London?

1715
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:38,920
 No.

1716
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:40,920
 Oh.

1717
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:41,920
 It was me.

1718
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:42,920
 What's the story, James?

1719
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:43,920
 There's no story.

1720
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:44,920
 I just liked hedges.

1721
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:48,920
 No, I got, I lived in the countryside and someone came around and said,

1722
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:50,920
 would you be interested in giving us some money for hedges?

1723
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:51,920
 And I said, no.

1724
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:52,920
 And they said, what about time?

1725
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:55,920
 And I felt so bad that I spent a lot of time fixing hedges.

1726
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:56,920
 Cutting hedges.

1727
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:57,920
 Not cutting them.

1728
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:58,920
 Not cutting them.

1729
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:00,920
 Just sort of going around asking people to pay money.

1730
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:01,920
 Oh.

1731
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:03,920
 Oh, that sounds like a pyramid scheme.

1732
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,920
 [LAUGHTER]

1733
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,920
 OK, this one is for you, James.

1734
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:08,920
 Yeah.

1735
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:09,920
 OK, who said this?

1736
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:12,920
 I have an unbeatable arm wrestling technique.

1737
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:15,920
 But can't do it anymore due to injuries.

1738
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,920
 Oh, I'm going to go for Dan.

1739
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,920
 It's a few murmurs of yes in the audience.

1740
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:21,920
 Dan, how's your arm wrestling?

1741
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:23,920
 Pretty damn good.

1742
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:25,920
 But can anyone beat you?

1743
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:26,920
 Uh, yeah.

1744
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:27,920
 So many people.

1745
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:28,920
 Yeah.

1746
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:29,920
 Yeah.

1747
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:31,920
 Andy, there's no point asking you, is there?

1748
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:35,920
 [LAUGHTER]

1749
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:39,920
 Does anyone truly think it's Andy?

1750
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:40,920
 Andy, was it you?

1751
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:41,920
 I don't know.

1752
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:42,920
 No, it wasn't.

1753
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:43,920
 It's me.

1754
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:44,920
 It's me, my arm.

1755
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:45,920
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1756
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:46,920
 Wow.

1757
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:49,920
 It's just a trick you stand on the right part of the table and you can't lose.

1758
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:50,920
 Anyway.

1759
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:52,920
 How did you injury-- how did you-- how do you--

1760
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:54,920
 I guess a very good arm wrestler.

1761
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:55,920
 Oh, it wasn't.

1762
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:56,920
 It wasn't, it wasn't.

1763
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:59,920
 You can also rip a yellow pages book in half, just like on the spot.

1764
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:00,920
 It's really exciting.

1765
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:01,920
 But they've stopped making those books now.

1766
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:02,920
 So yellow pages.

1767
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:03,920
 Boomer.

1768
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:04,920
 Yeah.

1769
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:05,920
 [LAUGHTER]

1770
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:08,920
 Now all my phone numbers are on my phone and you can't rip that in half.

1771
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:09,920
 No.

1772
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:12,920
 OK, whichever said this, I got married--

1773
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:15,920
 sorry, this is for Jamie and Andy Watt's score.

1774
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:17,920
 I think you just got one right, didn't you, James?

1775
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:18,920
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1776
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:19,920
 I think James is what--

1777
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:20,920
 James is what--

1778
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:21,920
 I think.

1779
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:22,920
 [LAUGHTER]

1780
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:24,920
 This is how I got new to my scoring.

1781
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:26,920
 James is one no ahead.

1782
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:27,920
 Final answer.

1783
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:33,920
 Is this someone scoring my scoring, please?

1784
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:34,920
 There's an absolute shambles.

1785
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:35,920
 OK.

1786
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:37,920
 Jamie Martin, who said this?

1787
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:43,920
 I got married in a room where the Earl of Sandwich invented the sandwich.

1788
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,920
 Now, were you any of our weddings?

1789
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:49,920
 No, I didn't get-- I knew you before you were--

1790
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:50,920
 Oh, no, you didn't.

1791
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:51,920
 We knew each other.

1792
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:52,920
 It became happy.

1793
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:53,920
 [LAUGHTER]

1794
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:55,920
 We knew each other, and I had two weddings.

1795
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,920
 And not invited to either, thanks.

1796
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:58,920
 We were friends, though.

1797
01:05:58,920 --> 01:05:59,920
 We knew each other, but we weren't like--

1798
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:00,920
 That's right.

1799
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:02,920
 And the same wife, by the way.

1800
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:04,920
 I just want to point that out.

1801
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:07,920
 We won a free wedding in a magazine.

1802
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:10,920
 And then so we had our first wedding, and then we did a second wedding two days later.

1803
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:11,920
 It was insane.

1804
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,920
 And was it anywhere near the other sandwich?

1805
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,920
 [LAUGHTER]

1806
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:17,920
 I can't remember.

1807
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:18,920
 We definitely had sandwich.

1808
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:19,920
 That's kind of the other thing.

1809
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:20,920
 What's going on?

1810
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:21,920
 OK, sorry.

1811
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:28,920
 So someone got married near the room where the Earl of Sandwich invented the sandwich.

1812
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:29,920
 I'm hearing--

1813
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:30,920
 I'm not going to say Andy.

1814
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:31,920
 OK.

1815
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:32,920
 Andy, what's it you?

1816
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:33,920
 Certainly was.

1817
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:34,920
 Yes.

1818
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:35,920
 Yeah.

1819
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:36,920
 Very nice.

1820
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:37,920
 I ran the applause.

1821
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:38,920
 Thanks.

1822
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:39,920
 Yeah.

1823
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:41,920
 For a completely random one in three guests.

1824
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,920
 I think they just happy that he's married.

1825
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:44,920
 I think it was for--

1826
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:46,920
 [LAUGHTER]

1827
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:47,920
 Sorry, ladies.

1828
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:51,920
 [LAUGHTER]

1829
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:52,920
 OK.

1830
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:55,920
 I like the room where the Earl of Sandwich invented the sandwich.

1831
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:56,920
 Amazing.

1832
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:57,920
 And was that a deliberate choice?

1833
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:59,920
 Did you choose it because of the sandwich connection?

1834
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:00,920
 Of course.

1835
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:01,920
 Yeah.

1836
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:04,920
 Is this marriage right at the end of the two-week sleepover that you had in the show?

1837
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,920
 [LAUGHTER]

1838
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:07,920
 OK.

1839
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:08,920
 So what's the score, Andy?

1840
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:09,920
 One all.

1841
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,920
 [LAUGHTER]

1842
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:12,920
 I'm so sure of it.

1843
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:13,920
 I'm really happy.

1844
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:14,920
 OK.

1845
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:15,920
 The next question.

1846
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:16,920
 Four James.

1847
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:17,920
 This is your last question, in fact.

1848
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:18,920
 Oh, God.

1849
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:20,920
 Who said this on the podcast?

1850
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:24,920
 As a child, people always told me I smelled of milk.

1851
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:26,920
 [LAUGHTER]

1852
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:29,920
 It sounds ridiculous, but I'm going to go for down again.

1853
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,920
 Daniel Shriver.

1854
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:35,920
 As a child, did everyone tell you that you smelled of milk?

1855
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:36,920
 They sure did.

1856
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:37,920
 [LAUGHTER]

1857
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:43,920
 [APPLAUSE]

1858
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:45,920
 Expand, explain.

1859
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:47,920
 We'll have a sniff and see if I'm still--

1860
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:48,920
 I try to.

1861
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:49,920
 No, that's bullsemen.

1862
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:50,920
 [LAUGHTER]

1863
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:52,920
 Famously odeless.

1864
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:53,920
 OK.

1865
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:55,920
 Final question for Jamie.

1866
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:56,920
 And it's two-one.

1867
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:57,920
 It's two-one.

1868
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:59,920
 [LAUGHTER]

1869
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:01,920
 Please get this wrong.

1870
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,920
 Who on the podcast said this?

1871
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:08,920
 I love to watch Oprah Winfrey clips of military homecoming

1872
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:10,920
 videos to make myself cry.

1873
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:18,920
 [LAUGHTER]

1874
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:20,920
 I actually need to go.

1875
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:23,920
 But this has been really fun.

1876
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:27,920
 You're looking at three very emotionally sensitive men.

1877
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:28,920
 Clearly.

1878
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:29,920
 Could be anyone.

1879
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:30,920
 Four.

1880
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:31,920
 Oprah Winfrey.

1881
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:32,920
 [LAUGHTER]

1882
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:34,920
 Thank you.

1883
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:37,920
 James, it was not me.

1884
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:41,920
 I have never cried in my life.

1885
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:42,920
 Andrew Hunter Murray.

1886
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:43,920
 Are you the funsome cryer?

1887
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:44,920
 Nope.

1888
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:46,920
 Daniel Shriver.

1889
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:48,920
 Huh?

1890
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:49,920
 Shut up, whatever.

1891
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:50,920
 Yes, OK.

1892
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:52,920
 I watch Oprah Winfrey clips and cry.

1893
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:54,920
 There's one where someone bought her shoes and they stand in them

1894
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:56,920
 so they could feel like Oprah.

1895
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:57,920
 It's so emotional.

1896
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,920
 [LAUGHTER]

1897
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:00,920
 OK.

1898
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:02,920
 So that's the end of the quiz.

1899
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:03,920
 I do believe.

1900
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:04,920
 Andrew Hunter Murray.

1901
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:05,920
 Do we have a winner?

1902
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:06,920
 We do.

1903
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:07,920
 And it's James.

1904
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:08,920
 The winner!

1905
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:09,920
 James!

1906
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:11,920
 Ladies and gentlemen!

1907
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:14,920
 [APPLAUSE]

1908
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:18,920
 Well, James, we're very excited to announce that we forgot

1909
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:19,920
 what prize to get you.

1910
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:23,920
 And therefore, we'll take your details and give you something later.

1911
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:25,920
 [LAUGHTER]

1912
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:28,920
 But for now, for everyone in the room, that is it.

1913
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:29,920
 That is all of our facts.

1914
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:30,920
 Thank you so much for listening.

1915
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:33,920
 Thank you for everyone who has joined us around the world

1916
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:34,920
 on the livestream.

1917
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:37,920
 We are all found on our online accounts.

1918
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:39,920
 You can get us on Instagram.

1919
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:40,920
 I'm there.

1920
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:41,920
 I'm on @ShriverLand.

1921
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:42,920
 James.

1922
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:43,920
 I'm on TikTok.

1923
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:44,920
 No, since James Harkin.

1924
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:45,920
 Andy.

1925
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:46,920
 I need to go up Mrs. Golf.

1926
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:49,920
 [LAUGHTER]

1927
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:51,920
 80,000 photos on his grid.

1928
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:52,920
 It's insane.

1929
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:53,920
 [LAUGHTER]

1930
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:54,920
 It's too much, mate.

1931
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:55,920
 It's too much.

1932
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:56,920
 And Jamie.

1933
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:57,920
 Uncle Ego.

1934
01:09:57,920 --> 01:09:58,920
 It's weird.

1935
01:09:58,920 --> 01:09:59,920
 Don't worry.

1936
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:00,920
 [LAUGHTER]

1937
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:01,920
 OK.

1938
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:04,920
 And if you want to send us any of your facts,

1939
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:08,920
 you can do that as well by going to podcast@QI.com.

 that you want to talk about.

1943
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:15,920
 We take it all and we bring it to our special secret room,

 Come and do that.
