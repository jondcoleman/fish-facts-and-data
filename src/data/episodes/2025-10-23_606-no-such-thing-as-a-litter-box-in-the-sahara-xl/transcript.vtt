WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 Hello and welcome to a very special bit of content.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.080
 Now this is what we call big fish.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.840
 It is an XL version of a previous episode of No Six Things A Fish and we have put it up

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.160
 here to show you exactly what you can get if you go to the plenty more fish tier of club

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.360
 fish.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.780
 On top of this you will get a video version of DROPPERS ALINE and you will also get a

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.040
 vinyl sticker after staying with us for three months.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.600
 For the people who want a little bit more fish in their lives and that's why we called

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.640
 it plenty more fish.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.640
 If you want to go even higher still you can go to friend of the podcast where you will

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:44.840
 get an exclusive t-shirt access to a three monthly video quiz and you will get access to

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.000
 the archives of No Six Things A Fish.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.400
 We call it the aquarium.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.440
 It's got loads of unreleased material in there and of course you will become custodian

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.280
 of a fact one of our lovely little facts will be put into your custodian ship and you will

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.440
 also get a mention on the main feed.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.040
 So thank you for joining our top tier.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.720
 But if you don't want any of that then fear not because the main episode of fish that goes

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.000
 out every Friday is free and will always be free.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 Anyway, really hope you enjoy this XL version of fish on with the big fish!

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:33.400
 Good evening ladies and gentlemen and welcome to No Such Things A Fish.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.560
 Are you ready?

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:47.560
 Please welcome to the stage No Such Thing As A Fish.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.240
 Thank you everyone for being here.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.240
 Thank you so much.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.240
 This is very exciting for us.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.400
 We love doing our live shows.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.320
 We're very proud to have been invited to the 10 year anniversary of the London Podcast

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.320
 Festival.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.640
 This is something that we played quite a few times.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.720
 Do we ever play it the first year?

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.720
 No.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.720
 We weren't invited.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.720
 No.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.720
 But why don't we bring out our guests?

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.800
 We have a very exciting guest.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.880
 So it's not just the 10 year anniversary of the London Podcast Festival, but on the 4th

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:18.880
 of October 2015 a woman called Belinda blinked for the very first time.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.880
 She blinked into existence and it gave birth to what is basically the pop culture podcast

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.200
 phenomena of the UK and we're very excited to have one of the members here.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.040
 Could you please welcome onto the stage celebrating his 10 year anniversary of his own show.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.360
 His dad wrote a porno.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.760
 Jamie Morden, everyone.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.680
 10 years.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.720
 This is the first place we ever played porno.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.720
 That's true.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.720
 Oh, really?

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.720
 You first have a live show.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.720
 Yes.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.720
 Yeah.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.720
 That's cool, man.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.720
 I was here for it.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.720
 Yes, stalker.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.720
 Yeah.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.720
 Didn't know him.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.720
 Still don't really.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.320
 I was in the audience and they did a tombola thing at the end to give away a prize and they picked

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:09.200
 out a winner and the first winner was for a row that didn't exist in the room.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.440
 So this secret.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.440
 Yeah.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.520
 Surely every theatre has a row.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.040
 It was like 0.2 or so.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.040
 That's not a row.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.040
 It was really weird.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.040
 It took ages to work out the row didn't exist and then they did it again and it was a sold-out

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.040
 show.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.040
 It landed on the only seat that was empty.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.040
 So no one.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.040
 Thanks, Dan.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.240
 So anyway, I love you to be here, but then the third one came and it was my seat.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.240
 And I won.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.240
 Yeah.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.920
 And I came up and it looked like the whole thing was fixed and grew in the moment.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:38.920
 What did you win?

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:39.920
 A mug.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:40.920
 A mug.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:41.920
 Signed?

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:42.920
 Yeah.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:43.920
 By?

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:44.920
 Your dad.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.920
 Of course.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:46.920
 He signs everything.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:47.920
 If you can find a mug that isn't signed by dad, it's worth the fortune.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:48.920
 I'm just so excited.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.920
 I'm so just to level with everyone.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.360
 This is such an intense show to do.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.360
 There's so much prep.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.360
 It's like homework.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.360
 I've been cramming.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.360
 Yeah.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.360
 Where's your dad now?

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.360
 Yeah.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.240
 I'm nothing without him as you're all about to see.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.040
 You should have got him to do your research.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.040
 That would have been incredible.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.040
 Oh my God.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.040
 Next time.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.040
 Next time.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.040
 Well, listen, we've got a show to do.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.040
 We don't have a tumbola, but we do have a competition, don't we?

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.040
 Absolutely.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.840
 Because you guys have been sending in your facts, which I've got on my phone here.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.200
 What we're going to do is we're going to read a few of them out and then we're going

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.640
 to choose one winner and that person will go into a head-to-head against our very special

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.640
 guest tonight.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.400
 So it's a big prize.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.960
 I'll read out a few facts and we'll decide which is our favourite thing.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:32.960
 Okay.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:33.960
 So here's one.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:34.960
 It's not going to name on it.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.480
 It's from Road 0.2.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.640
 They said a new spider has been discovered in Australia, which is now known to be the most

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.520
 dangerous spider.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:53.160
 It's a subspecies of the Sydney for the web and it's called the Newcastle Big Boy.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.160
 That is good.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.160
 That's a great face.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.160
 That's it.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.160
 Can we see the audience?

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.160
 Yes, please.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.640
 Who's that audience?

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:00.640
 Confess.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.640
 Oh, there it is.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:02.640
 Right at the back.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.640
 Oh, the way.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.440
 The only spot that the light does not hit.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.640
 What's your name?

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.640
 Charlie.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.640
 Charlie.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:11.640
 And are you from Australia?

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.640
 Oh, good.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.640
 Oh, wow.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:14.640
 And here's another one.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.160
 This is from James and Kerry and this is much more low-brow.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.080
 House fly sperm is larger than human sperm.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.080
 Really?

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.080
 What?

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.080
 House fly sperm.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.880
 House fly sperm is larger than human sperm.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.880
 I know what a sperm I know about.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.360
 I've had 10 years of sperm.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.360
 Professionally.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.360
 How do you know this?

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.360
 You know what I mean.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.160
 Five to six centriots is boiled up.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.160
 Five to six centriots.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.160
 And the house fly.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.160
 Brilliant.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.720
 Well, here's another one.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.440
 Again, I don't have a name on this.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.640
 This person says they're recovering from a broken ankle.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.780
 It's a talus bone fracture, which is known as the aviator fracture, because when Spitfire

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.480
 pilots crash landed their planes, they had to keep their feet on the pedals until

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.800
 they were safely down and so they would all break their ankles when they landed.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.800
 Yikes.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.400
 Who is the person with a broken ankle?

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.400
 What's your name?

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.400
 Sadie.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.400
 Sadie.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.400
 That's a terrific fact.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.400
 Do you want to choose one?

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.000
 Well, I guess Jamie, you're going to be going up against someone.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.800
 Who do you think you can beat those people?

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.800
 What was it?

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.800
 New culture people.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:18.800
 It's got to be the sperm.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.800
 I'm sorry.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:20.800
 OK.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.880
 So, James or Kerry, would you be willing to come up on stage in a bit later?

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:25.880
 One of you.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:26.880
 Tell you when.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.120
 Stay where you are for now.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.280
 You've got a full hour to worry about it.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:33.280
 Kerry's just made very clear.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.760
 It's going to be James giving up on stage.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:36.760
 All right.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.240
 Well, you guys ready for us to do a show?

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.520
 Roll the theme tune.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:55.640
 Hello and welcome to another episode of

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.640
 No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:06.360
 This week coming to you live from the London Podcast Festival.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.120
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.560
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin, and Jamie Morton.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.080
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.560
 from the last seven days.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.040
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.200
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Jamie.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.280
 No particular order, the guest first.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.280
 OK.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.280
 Don't destroy our show straight away.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.280
 It's just a light.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.280
 I like it.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.280
 OK.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:40.600
 Iconic, Festbian, beer bone, had a walk on part in every single production at the Geal

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.640
 Good Theatre in London's West End for 20 years.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:50.880
 And fittingly, had a front page obituary in the stage newspaper.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:56.280
 He was also a cat.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.280
 I know.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.320
 I mean, like, what a hag.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.520
 I'm sorry.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.240
 That is a Festbian cat.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:01.840
 That is.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:02.840
 Yeah.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:07.680
 For people listening on the podcast next week, or whenever it goes out, can you describe

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:08.760
 the cat who was Jamie?

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.840
 We've got a tabby cat, he's male.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:14.360
 And he's lounging on stage at the Geal Good.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.720
 Looking very happy with his beautifully lit.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:17.480
 It's black and white.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.160
 It's very-- it sounds like a headshot, but it's a full body.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.160
 Yeah.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.160
 Yeah.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.160
 Shea's long kind of look.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.960
 That little-- is that a photo of a tail?

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.280
 He's like saying, paint me like one of your French cats.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.280
 It's giving that energy.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.280
 Oh, yeah.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.280
 Yeah.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.840
 Say the opulence as well around it in terms of the architecture.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:33.840
 Yeah.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:34.840
 I mean, I love this cat.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:35.840
 So--

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:36.840
 I'm not going to lie.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:37.840
 I've fallen in love with him this week.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:38.840
 I've never heard of him before, but now I love him.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:43.600
 So when you say walk on roll in all the plays, was that official, was he-- was he written

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:44.600
 into--

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.600
 No.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.600
 No.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.920
 Is the resident-- is it like Mouser?

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:50.920
 Is that--

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:54.160
 Yeah, Mouser name that they caught the mice.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:59.800
 And he just would randomly walk on stage during productions, which, being a theatre director,

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:04.840
 I find chilling, because you work so hard to kind of make a show good, then some fucking

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.120
 cats just like wandering in front of everyone.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.120
 And what did the actors think of it?

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.120
 Were they--

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.880
 Well, the actors, like, loved this cat.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:16.520
 Like, almost uniformly, I think there wasn't a single actor who didn't love him.

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:21.360
 And he didn't love beer bone, because he is, as I said, a total hag.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.360
 I mean, look at him.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:29.040
 But yeah, he was loved, and-- and people got very attached to him.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:33.200
 So much so that he had this obituary on the front page of the stage newspaper.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:37.960
 And people like Penelope Keith wrote obituries for him, like loads of actors kind of got involved.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:42.320
 The stage, I hadn't heard of the stage, is that, like, the main, main thing that you

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.320
 can get on it?

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.320
 The Bible.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.320
 Dan, honestly.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.320
 Oh, man.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.320
 I actually heard of it.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.840
 I was just being them for a second.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:49.840
 Yeah.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.840
 Then they've heard of it, too.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.480
 Oh, so it is just being-- it's a great news paper, yeah.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.480
 No, it is.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.480
 It's a great news paper.

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.480
 It's behind a play wall, but it's great.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:01.760
 OK, a lot of people did love beer bone, but beer bone would arrive on stage at moments

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.600
 that weren't necessarily good for a scene.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.520
 You know, there was one-- there was one play that was on, which was called the House of

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:12.000
 Bernard Alba, which had a lot of sand all over the stage.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 Oh, no.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.360
 Beer bone was the ultimate pooing ground.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.520
 That was not good, right, at this moment.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:22.520
 Not good for who?

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.520
 We loved it.

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:24.520
 It adds realism to the play.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:25.520
 Oh, yeah.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:26.520
 That's where it's set.

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:31.080
 If it's set in the pitiless desert of the Sahara, it actually, I would say, kills the

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.480
 mood a bit to have a house cat.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.480
 There are enough.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:38.680
 Some people think it's good luck for a cat to be on stage, and in America, at least, there

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:44.000
 was a superstition that if a black cat came into the theatre, that was really good luck.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.760
 And if it came on the first night, that was really, really good luck, and the whole show

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:48.760
 was going to be amazing.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:49.760
 Right.

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:55.280
 And so the fifth avenue theatre in New York used to keep a black cat backstage, and then

00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:00.440
 on the first show of every run, that they would throw it out there so that it was on stage.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:01.440
 And that was good luck.

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:02.440
 Oh, yeah.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:06.480
 And the reason you said "Mouser" a second ago, Jamie, the reason that cats used to be very,

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:11.240
 very important in theatre is because back in the day, food being thrown on stage to show

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:14.280
 your all-pleasure or pleasure in a play was a massive thing.

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:17.920
 So at the end of every night, food was just everywhere, all over the stage, which brought

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.640
 in the mice, and mice were a huge, huge problem.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:25.320
 So theatres would have, sometimes, up to 20 cats roaming around, catching mice if they

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.320
 had problems.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.760
 But a lot of those cats would lie on their CVs.

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.600
 You've put on who you also do birds.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.600
 Is that true?

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.600
 Oh, yeah.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.600
 Yeah.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.400
 The film was on the payroll, I read.

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:41.880
 He was officially listed on the Gilgur payroll, which, as a former accountant, I think brings

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.920
 up a whole host of problems.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.240
 Like, who pays the national insurance on that?

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.240
 Yep.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.240
 I wonder who his agent was?

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.240
 I don't know.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.240
 Someone bloody good.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.240
 15% of a count.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:55.320
 And apparently, he would disappear from time to time, according to Dame Hilda Brackett,

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:59.800
 he would dash off to see a particular friend at the Lyric theatre.

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:00.800
 His girlfriend?

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:01.800
 Yeah.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.280
 She said, "We used to hear lots of meows.

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.280
 This was so how after all."

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.280
 I love it.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:10.840
 Do you think, well, look, most West Enfielders have cats, as you said.

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:11.840
 Yeah.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:12.840
 They're all mates.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:13.840
 Do you think they just, like, all meet up at...

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:17.720
 Oh, that's a cute, that's a great show, though, that you should have seen the performers

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:18.720
 for this.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:22.480
 Well, the lots of theatres did have cats in there.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:27.120
 So the Noel Cow Theatre had two cats, imaginative, called Girl Cat and Boy Cat.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:32.040
 And I think Boy Cat only ever distinguished himself once when he ate Princess Margaret's

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.040
 bouquet.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.040
 Is that a euphemism?

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.040
 No, it's not.

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:39.160
 It's a bloody good one, isn't it?

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:44.800
 Yeah, apparently, he also escaped offstage during a performance of a musical five-guys'

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:49.200
 name Moe, and he would go under the stage and he would only come out when someone tapped

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.200
 out Stolverham.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.200
 Right.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:57.400
 There was a cat called Ambrose at the theatre Royal Jury Lane, which I think you've performed

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.400
 at.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:59.400
 Oh, yeah.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:03.880
 And this cat got into a beef with Michael Crawford.

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:08.040
 He kept upstaging Michael Crawford and Michael Crawford had no sense of humour about this.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:11.080
 It's Michael Crawford, the original phantom, yes.

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:12.880
 But was he also Frank Spencer?

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:13.880
 Yeah, Frank Spencer.

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:14.880
 Open tea.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:15.880
 That guy.

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:16.880
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:17.880
 A varied career, I think.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:18.880
 I was going to say yellow.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:22.880
 But then, and so, Michael Crawford was like kicking off about this cat, but every single

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:25.760
 person in the theatre took the cat's side.

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:26.760
 What does that say?

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:27.760
 Wow.

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:31.640
 I read about one that was at the Sadler's Wells.

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:36.880
 It was called Sadler, the cat, and Sadler in 1956 just suddenly disappeared.

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:40.440
 But unlike the other cats who would come on unprompted, Sadler actually had a role in

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:41.440
 a play.

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.440
 Oh, no.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:47.440
 So, in the stage, magazine, they had an advert to audition for a new cat for the show, and

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:48.760
 I found the advert.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:53.600
 It said, owing to the dramatic disappearance of Sadler, official theatre cat at the Wells,

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:57.720
 the important feline role and the forthcoming production of School of Fathers falls vacant

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:03.000
 or additions will be held, applicants must be fully grown and capable of maintaining dignity

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.400
 and poise atop a 10-foot high wall, despite the distractions of a full, operatic orchestra

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.240
 and audience laughter and applause.

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:14.880
 The chosen artist will receive full her service, one sardine and two complementary tickets

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:15.880
 per performance.

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.680
 Wow.

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.440
 And did you see who got the part?

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:20.440
 No.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:24.760
 It was a cat called Keats, and according to the Daily Telegraphy beat off tough composition

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:31.720
 from cats called Fantasia, Nimbus, Klott and Mr Woodbury Bentley.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:32.720
 And they had two auditions.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:37.120
 In the second audition, he jumped off the wall that he was sitting on and then walked over

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:42.600
 to the bar and started knocking down bottles, and they decided this was a perfect cat for

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.600
 the theatre.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:47.520
 You know, this is exactly what the old actors would do, so, yeah.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:48.520
 So good.

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:49.520
 How can you cast a cat in a play?

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:53.280
 They just, they famously don't play bull, well, they play with bulls, but you know what

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:54.280
 I mean.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.280
 Yeah.

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:56.280
 I know.

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:57.280
 To direct, I would imagine.

00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:58.280
 Yeah.

00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.280
 Dogs, I think, do get a look in sometimes on the West End.

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:02.800
 I was trying to find other animals that have been in West End productions.

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:03.800
 Yeah.

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:04.800
 Oh, yeah.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:08.440
 So there was a Guardian report in 2001 that there was a production of The Taming of the

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:11.960
 True, which had an entire cast of chickens, and I cannot find out whether it was like a

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:16.000
 whole flock of chickens and a human cast or whether it was an entire cast of chickens.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 Ah.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 Like.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 But when they all fired, I think.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 They were sacked, yes.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 Yeah.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 Apparently for being too hysterical.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.360
 I don't know what the hysterical chicken can't imagine how hysterical they got when they

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.360
 were told they were fired.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.360
 Yeah.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.360
 That's the big on the room.

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.360
 Guys, we're going to have fun.

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.360
 You go.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.640
 By the way, beer bomb, the cat.

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:36.640
 Do we know?

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.240
 Do you guys know why it's called beer bomb?

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.480
 There was a famous actor called beer, but I don't know what they're going to say.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.480
 Yeah.

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:42.480
 He was a theater manager.

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.480
 He was an actor as well.

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:48.560
 His name was Sir Herbert Beerbomb Tree, and he founded Rada, the Royal Academy of Dramatic

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.560
 Arts.

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:50.560
 Yeah.

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:51.560
 And he's a pretty, he's a pretty amazing character.

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:52.880
 He released a few records.

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:55.960
 He did hamlets to be or not to be on vinyl.

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:56.960
 That's pretty cool.

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:59.640
 It's just really sin his own stuff.

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:04.800
 But he also, he's from the Beerbomb family, which is quite an amazing family, Max Beerbomb.

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:07.360
 The satirical writer was part of that family.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:11.840
 Virtually every child that he had was part of some major bit of theater in the day.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.320
 He had a lot of illegitimate children as well.

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:18.320
 His grandson from one of those moments was Oliver Reed.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.120
 So he's very connected.

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:24.440
 He's basically the reason that Shakespeare is so popular today, Beerbomb Tree, I think.

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:25.440
 Right.

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.360
 Yeah, because in those days, so this was what?

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.480
 It was 19th century.

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:33.040
 People were kind of putting Shakespeare on, but it was very stuffy.

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.040
 People didn't really like it.

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:35.200
 It was going out of fashion.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:39.440
 And then he started putting loads of Shakespeare plays on and making them real sort of blockbuster

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:43.040
 shows so that everyone loved to go there and loved to see it.

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:47.560
 And he was also the person who put, I think, the first film Shakespeare?

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.520
 I think he was the guy who did that as well.

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:49.520
 Right.

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:53.040
 He went over to America and did a hamlet on my path, I was up in.

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:54.040
 Right.

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.040
 Yeah, he's a...

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.760
 So he's what's a blame, basically?

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:57.760
 Yeah, yeah.

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:03.680
 And also, randomly, in the play "Cats," there is a reference which is said to Gus from

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:04.680
 "Geliorum."

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:05.920
 Is that the name of the cat in it?

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.920
 The line as he's acted with Oving, he's acted with Tree.

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:09.920
 "Cats."

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:10.920
 I'm so glad we're on "Cats."

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:14.560
 So thing one, when you think about it, "Cats" is an anagram of "Cast."

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:15.560
 Okay.

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:18.560
 And?

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:19.760
 Boy, it just makes you think, doesn't it?

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:20.760
 Yeah.

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:21.760
 Yeah.

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.760
 And it's also an anagram of "Act."

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.760
 Oh, my God.

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:29.760
 I was so pleased with myself.

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:30.760
 "Cast."

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:33.160
 And they got to stack, but without the cage.

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:34.160
 Nah.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.160
 And they thought, oh, that's brilliant.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.160
 Is that it?

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.760
 That was the fact.

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:40.760
 That was the fact.

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:45.120
 He messaged us, saying, "I've got some amazing stuff on cats that I need to say on stage."

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:50.320
 "I spent six hours reading about the musical cats because you had a cat's back, and that was it."

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.120
 Well, I just wanted to introduce yours.

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:53.120
 Yeah, go on.

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:55.320
 Well, I have quite a good one about cats, the musical.

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:56.320
 Do you?

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:57.320
 Yeah.

00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:01.320
 For its broadway run, they used over 49,000 condoms.

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.320
 Ah!

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:03.320
 Oh, sorry!

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:04.320
 Yeah.

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:05.320
 Can we guess?

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.320
 Why?

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:07.320
 "Dentch."

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:08.320
 "Dentch."

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:09.320
 "Dentch."

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:10.320
 "Dentch."

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.320
 Sadly, "Dentch."

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:14.320
 "Ruptured Her Achilles," so couldn't perform in cats.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:15.720
 Although she was originally cats.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:16.720
 She was meant to be.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:17.720
 She was originally cats.

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:18.720
 In cats.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:19.720
 In cats.

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:20.720
 Yeah.

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:21.720
 Why do you think they used so many condoms?

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.720
 To stop things from getting wet is my first thought.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:25.720
 What sort of thing?

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.720
 You smuggle drugs for the cast.

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:30.720
 No, you're on the right lines, James.

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:31.720
 Yeah.

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.120
 To protect something.

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.120
 Is it?

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:35.120
 Okay.

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.120
 Oh, is it for...

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:43.360
 So a lot of preppers will use condoms to store water because a condom, like a water balloon,

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.960
 holds gallons of water.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:45.960
 Absolutely not.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:46.960
 I know.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:53.560
 If you ever go to Danesford, dinner, he offers still sparkling or pure tasting of spermicide.

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:56.560
 Sorry, Andy.

00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:58.560
 Cats have claws, don't they?

00:18:58.560 --> 00:18:59.560
 Yes.

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:03.560
 So it's to protect the claws in transit and they had 49...

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.560
 Well, real cats have claws.

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:06.560
 This is a show with people.

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:07.560
 Yeah.

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:08.560
 Alright, put us out and move.

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.560
 It was...

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:10.560
 You were right, James.

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:13.160
 It was to protect their microphone packs.

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.360
 They were sweating so much because it's a dance show, right?

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:18.760
 They're dancing so much that they would put their mic packs in condoms.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:19.760
 49,000?

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:20.760
 Yeah.

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:24.760
 After each show, they're just like tip loads of condoms in the bin outside of this.

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:26.760
 Oh, it's a sweet show.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:32.160
 While we're on Andrew Lloyd Webber, there's another cat connection, which is the fact that

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.560
 Phantom of the Opera now has a sequel.

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:38.920
 Many, many years ago Lloyd Webber was working on that sequel and he was rising it with

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.560
 Frederick Forsyth, the author.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.760
 The author, the author, exactly.

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:43.760
 So they were writing it.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:47.440
 He'd written all the music and he had it on his electric piano and then one day he sat

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:53.200
 down to write a new song and his kitten, called Otto, stepped on the keyboard and erased the

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.320
 entire score.

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.320
 And so we never got it.

00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:00.880
 The main thing about Cat Charlie is the movie, the amazing movie that came out a few years ago.

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:01.880
 Oh, yeah.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.840
 And it was really the start of the pandemic, I think.

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:05.680
 It was right at the start of the pandemic, wasn't it?

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:06.680
 Yeah.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:07.680
 I was at that moment.

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:08.680
 It was the pandemic.

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:09.680
 I don't know.

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:10.680
 It was not longer.

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:15.320
 We knew something bad was in the air when cats came out.

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:20.240
 And the big thing about that is the CGI bumholes that all the cats had.

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.240
 Wow.

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.240
 Isn't it?

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:26.720
 Well, there is, is it true or not, because that is urban myth, is it true?

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:27.720
 It's urban myth.

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:32.280
 So someone tweeted, a guy called Jack Waz, and I think, I mean, that sounds like an honest

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:33.280
 man, doesn't it?

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:34.280
 Jack Waz.

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:37.280
 The thing is James, you go to such impeccable lengths to source all of your facts.

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:41.480
 Like James goes deep into newspaper archives from 200 years ago, but he will also sometimes

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:45.200
 throw in like, at Jack Waz, I don't know.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.280
 At Jack Waz is the New York Times of our day.

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:55.200
 He said that a VFX producer, friend of a friend, was hired to get rid of the bumholes, right?

00:20:55.200 --> 00:21:01.000
 But then the Daily Beast online magazine found a VFX person, and they said it was true.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.160
 And they were definitely someone who worked on the show.

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:08.120
 And they said what had happened was actually the way the visual effects worked is they had

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:11.920
 a very special way of the fur being made.

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:15.800
 And the fur would go in little like holes, like your hair does, you know, you have walls in

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:16.800
 your hair.

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.920
 And so they had them on all the cats, and it just so happened that if you got them any

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:26.320
 of them from a certain angle, it looked like they had female genitalia or an anus.

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:31.280
 And they had to imply one person who basically it was their job to go through looking for

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.760
 the bumholes and then get rid of them.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:34.760
 Right.

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:35.760
 That's insane.

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:37.240
 That's such a high pressure job as well.

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:39.920
 You've got to catch every single one, you know?

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:40.920
 It's true.

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:41.920
 Yeah, yeah.

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:42.920
 I put them on.

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:43.920
 Yeah.

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:44.920
 I love it.

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:48.000
 They could catch all of the bumholes, but not Judith and she's wedding ring, which is on

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 throughout the fucking process.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 How is it?

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 As like an old cat.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.040
 So you got all of the rings, but one in the end.

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:55.040
 Is that good?

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:57.000
 Hey, I need to move us on to our next fight.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 Oh, oh.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 Oh, they just have one more thing.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 Yeah, sure, yeah.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.160
 Alice Swift's cat, right?

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.160
 In the movie.

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:04.160
 She's in the film.

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:05.160
 Oh, no, I mean her actual cat.

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.160
 Yes.

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.240
 It's called Olivia Benson.

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:17.560
 And it is reportedly worth over double the net worth of her fiance.

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:19.560
 It's her fiance Kelsey.

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:20.560
 Yeah, yeah.

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:24.840
 But Travis Kelsey is worth a mega $40 million.

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:31.120
 This fucking cat is worth 97 million dollars.

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:36.920
 And it says that most of that wealth has come from the cat's TV commercial work and Swift's

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:39.200
 music videos of blank space and me.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.200
 It's called.

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.200
 Okay.

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.960
 Where it's made all of its money.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:43.960
 What's the source of it?

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:44.960
 Is this jacket?

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:45.960
 Yeah.

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:46.960
 I'm not buying it.

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:47.960
 That's very interesting.

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:48.960
 Yeah.

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:49.960
 Wow.

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:51.720
 How awful that her cat is worth double her fiance.

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:52.720
 I think it's okay.

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:53.720
 No, it is okay.

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:55.680
 How many Super Bowls is he won?

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:56.680
 That's the thing.

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.280
 Kelsey's won a couple of Super Bowls.

00:22:58.280 --> 00:22:59.280
 I see.

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:02.200
 I thought you meant Kelsey Grammer who played Frazier.

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:05.360
 It's just as two brothers that I can never remember which ones.

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:08.200
 Because I know a lot more about NFL than I do about Taylor Swift.

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:09.200
 Is the truth.

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.200
 So name is Kelsey.

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:11.200
 I understand that.

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.200
 Cool.

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:16.080
 Interestingly, the one only major other pop culture reference to Herbert Beerbom Tree

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:18.360
 is in an episode of Frazier with Kelsey Grammer.

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:19.360
 No.

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:20.360
 Yeah.

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:21.360
 Who would have thought that would come up?

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:23.360
 It's in a thing called...

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.960
 This is all scripts, you guys.

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:27.880
 It's in the episode Daphne's Room.

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:31.520
 The plot involves Frazier's retrieval of a book from her room called The Life and Times

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.560
 of Sohera Burt Beerbom Tree.

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:34.560
 Great.

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:35.560
 Anyway, moving on.

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:38.280
 It's great to end with a bang.

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:39.280
 You know?

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:40.280
 Actually.

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:41.280
 Yeah.

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:46.120
 So it's time for fact number two.

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:47.240
 And that is my fact.

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:53.240
 My fact this week is that at one of the oldest bath houses in Japan, visitors have the

00:23:53.240 --> 00:24:07.240
 option of soaking in hot water, cold water, electric water or condom water.

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:08.760
 We need to call them and suggest that.

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:09.760
 No.

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:10.760
 The final one.

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:13.080
 There are many others, but the other one is radioactive water.

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:14.080
 Ooh.

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:15.080
 Yeah.

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:16.520
 People also drink this water.

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:20.680
 So it turns out I thought this was going to be unique to this one place in Japan, which

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:27.520
 is a radium onsen, an onsen as a word that means bath houses in Japan that use hot spring

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:30.240
 water and they take natural source water.

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.240
 And they use that.

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:35.240
 There's something like 25,000 hot spring sources in Japan that are used there everywhere.

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:36.240
 Yeah.

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:39.640
 And 3,000 onsen establishments all over Japan.

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:40.640
 So it's a real big thing there.

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:45.440
 And so like the electric water that you would sit in, that actually sends mild electric

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:47.880
 currents through the water as you're sitting in it.

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:52.600
 And people describe it as like being tickled by lightning as you're trying to relax.

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:53.600
 How relaxing.

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:54.600
 Yeah.

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:58.320
 Well, they see these baths not as necessarily completely relaxing.

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:01.160
 It's all about rejuvenation, it's all about health and so on.

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:04.840
 And so radioactive water, radium water is a thing.

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:07.080
 It's not bad for you, is it?

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:09.360
 The quantities are really, really small.

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:14.880
 The quantities are less than you would get if you were on a flight, for example.

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.360
 But that's flight.

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:21.320
 You know, we get hit by radioactive, you know, flares from space as you're on a flight.

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:25.720
 So James, quick jump in.

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:30.080
 There is radiation that comes from space and if the closer you are to it, the less space.

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.080
 Space.

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:32.080
 Space.

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:33.080
 It's a flight.

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:34.080
 Not Katy Perry.

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:35.080
 But it means you.

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:41.080
 But there's less of the atmosphere to block it out when your fervor up is the basics.

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.880
 But if you're on a plane all the time, it'll be bad for you.

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:47.720
 Like a air hostess or a pilot, for example, and it's bad for you.

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:48.720
 It's bad for you.

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:50.720
 What the hell are you talking about?

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.520
 They said that like it's safest way to travel.

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:54.520
 No.

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:56.760
 But if you live in Cornwall, there's radiation there too.

00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:57.760
 Yeah.

00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:01.520
 But here's some good lead box at the end of this.

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:03.640
 So there is radiation in Cornwall.

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:07.840
 Cornwall has more background radiation than anywhere else, but we all have a little bit.

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:13.000
 And a normal person would get two to three millisieverts of radiation in a year.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.040
 Well, there's a place called Ramsai in a run that has the highest radiation anywhere in

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:18.040
 the world.

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:21.440
 It's because they have hot springs and radiation underground and it comes up.

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:27.960
 And they get 260 millisieverts per year, which is more than 100 times what a normal person

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:28.960
 would get.

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:33.840
 But actually, the cancer incidence there is lower than any of their neighbours.

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:34.840
 Right.

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:38.040
 And what people think is the people who live there, they have a higher proportion of what's

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.040
 called T cells.

00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:42.680
 Remember in Covid, they said T cells, it's like, helped your immune system.

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:45.920
 And it turns out that people there have got higher proportion of T cells and it's the thing

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:51.560
 called Hormesis, which is the idea that very small low doses of something that would otherwise

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:54.760
 be harmful can actually make you stronger.

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:59.760
 And it is really, I mean, I'm not saying everyone should go out now and get as much radiation

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:00.760
 as possible.

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:01.760
 But it is.

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:02.760
 You just have a great time.

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:03.760
 That's amazing.

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:04.760
 Yeah.

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:05.760
 That really is amazing.

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:06.760
 It's very cool.

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:10.480
 So as I was saying a second ago, these are massive in Japan and I was trying to find more

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:14.120
 information about this very specific one in Osaka.

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:20.240
 And the best place I could find out about it was a website called tatufriendlyonson.com.

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:26.400
 And this is so interesting because in Japan, when you go to an onsen, largely it's separated.

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.400
 So men will go into one place.

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:28.400
 One will go into another.

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:29.400
 You have to be naked.

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:30.400
 You've got to be completely naked.

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:35.120
 And the problem is in Japan, if you have tattoos, you're not allowed to go and show

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:37.960
 your tattoos in these places because of the yakuza.

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:39.760
 So a lot of foreigners arrive trying to go...

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.360
 Because they're the gangsters.

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:42.360
 Yeah.

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:43.360
 The mafia basically.

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:44.360
 Yeah.

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:45.360
 Who are tattoos, typically.

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:46.360
 Yeah.

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:47.360
 Exactly.

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:51.240
 And so if you arrive and you've got like, you know, like, eternity, I love cherry, whatever

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:52.240
 on your face.

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.240
 I love...

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:57.240
 It's so revealing knowing what you would have gone for, though.

00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:59.440
 I didn't want to talk about my actual tattoos.

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:00.440
 Okay.

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:01.440
 I will.

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.440
 So, thug life across your...

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:03.440
 You tell me.

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:06.240
 They won't let you in because of the yakuza thing.

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:10.440
 So this website basically lists all of the onsens that you can go to and that will allow

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:11.440
 you in.

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:16.920
 Do you think the pork broth onsen would be one of those tattoo friendly ones?

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:17.920
 I think it might be.

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:18.920
 Yeah.

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:19.920
 This is amazing.

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:20.920
 This is...

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:21.920
 There's a place.

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:22.920
 Well, it's the pork broth hot tub.

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:24.080
 It's the Unison Spa.

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:27.880
 And they have a massive ramen bath, basically.

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:29.720
 And it's just slightly porky hot water.

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:30.720
 It sounds amazing.

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:31.720
 It's a noodles in there.

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:35.960
 Well, they dangle above you a huge sculpture that looks like a pair of tropsticks holding

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:36.960
 noodles.

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.360
 So it looks like you're about to be...

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:40.520
 It's like you're a soft boiled egg.

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:41.520
 It's like you're a...

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:42.520
 Yeah.

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:46.520
 And as you've seen my physique, that I am like a soft boiled egg, basically.

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:47.520
 But they've got a green tea bath.

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:50.600
 They've got a sake bath, which is very slightly sake.

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:53.400
 It's not obviously not all sake, because that'd be hugely expensive.

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:56.440
 They've got a coffee bath, which does not look appetising.

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:57.440
 Yeah.

00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:59.440
 It looks really gross.

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:00.440
 It's...

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:03.080
 It's safe if you have the runs, isn't it?

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.080
 Oh, yes.

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.080
 Absolutely.

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:06.080
 Yeah.

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.080
 That sounds...

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.080
 I'd love to go there.

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:09.080
 It does look cool.

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.080
 Sounds awesome.

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.520
 I have been to Anonsan, a few, in fact, in Japan.

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:13.520
 Really?

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:19.880
 There's a thing in Japan called Hadakano Sukui, which means naked camaraderie.

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:21.720
 And the idea is everyone gets naked.

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:25.920
 You're all together in a big sort of jacuzzi with no bubbles.

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:30.120
 And it means you're all emotionally together, open, honest.

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:31.520
 That's the idea behind it.

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:34.040
 And I must admit, I went in, ran in, had a bath.

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:36.760
 I just came out and went back to my room as quickly as I could.

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:37.760
 Oh, right.

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:38.760
 You didn't have any...

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:39.760
 Not very communal for you then.

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:40.760
 I don't speak Japanese.

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:43.760
 But there are other ways of communicating then.

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:47.640
 Yeah, but naked charades are the best of times is difficult.

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:49.800
 I'm just a harkest back to the last fact.

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:52.800
 You know that Andrew Lloyd Webber has a 30-person hot tub.

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:53.800
 That's disgusting.

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:54.800
 Does he?

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:59.600
 So it's a 30-person hot tub, meaning everyone gets a slot on the outer wall.

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:00.600
 I believe.

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:01.600
 What's the alternative?

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:06.320
 That it could go a bus format where it is like six by four.

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:07.320
 Like, what's the...

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:08.320
 Yeah.

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:09.320
 What?

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:11.320
 There's an aisle down the middle.

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:13.760
 Tickets, please.

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:15.760
 Chicken of fish.

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:16.760
 Nuts.

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:17.760
 No, we don't have any.

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:18.760
 I can just concede.

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:19.760
 No, I don't...

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:20.760
 Yeah, I don't know what...

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:21.760
 Yeah, I don't know.

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:22.760
 I think it must be...

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:23.760
 Everyone gets a bit of wall.

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:26.760
 Otherwise, you're just popping about in the middle, feeling like a...

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:27.760
 Like a lemon, yeah.

00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:28.760
 I hate that bit, yeah.

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:29.760
 Oh, yeah.

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:30.760
 Bobbing.

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:36.560
 Bob, in the Southern Island of Tremacutu, and it opened up, I think, in 2017.

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:38.720
 They'd announced it with big fanfare the year before.

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:41.440
 They said, "This is going to be a... actually, it wasn't a spa.

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:44.160
 It was a spa-themed amusement park."

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:50.840
 And they had released some images of, basically, a rollercoaster that's full of bath rollercoaster.

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:51.840
 Okay.

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:54.040
 What, you're in a little bath, and that's your...

00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:55.040
 Yeah.

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:56.040
 You know you get in the carriage.

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:57.040
 Yeah.

00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:58.040
 And it's a bath.

00:30:58.040 --> 00:30:59.040
 Wow.

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:00.040
 And you're in a spa.

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:01.880
 So they were not sure at the time if it could be done.

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:02.880
 Yeah.

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:05.720
 It was, like, beyond the, the can of humanity, but they, they, they did it.

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:09.400
 So you're in a compartment that is a jacuzzi, basically?

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:12.760
 I think they didn't quite correct the full rollercoaster bath.

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:13.760
 Yeah.

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:15.560
 Because that would have been very heavy, obviously.

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:16.560
 It was spill a lot.

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:17.560
 It was spill a lot.

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:18.560
 Yeah.

00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:19.560
 It's like an opposite log flume.

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:20.560
 Yeah.

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:21.560
 But water's in.

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:24.320
 If you're really unlucky, you'll be dry at the end of it.

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:25.320
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.320
 All the people waiting on the cycle.

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:28.320
 Oh, hang on.

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:29.320
 Yeah.

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:30.320
 Yeah.

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:31.320
 That's very interesting.

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:33.440
 There's another one, which I wonder if that's there as well, where you have an option of

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:36.600
 arriving and they bury you up to your neck and sand.

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:41.160
 And it's quite hot sand so that you can get whatever, you know, holistic therapy.

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:47.160
 So have you done, have you ever done any sort of odd pampering things like this?

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:49.640
 Um, that you're willing to admit too?

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:50.640
 Yeah.

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:54.080
 I was quite intrigued by the beer baths that you can do.

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:56.720
 You know, in Europe, in like the Czech Republic, like, there's a lot, they're quite popular

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:57.720
 now.

00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:01.560
 Um, it's like bathing, like, hoppy water, a bit like your ramen.

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:02.560
 Right, right, right.

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:05.320
 I wonder if you'd be interested in this, uh, this thing in Japan.

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:07.960
 It's the Nightingale Fese's Facial.

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:10.640
 Now, it's not what it sounds like.

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:15.120
 It's Fese's from the Japanese Bushwabler, which is not a true Nightingale.

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:16.120
 Oh.

00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:17.120
 Oh.

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.360
 Thank God.

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:23.760
 In Japanese, it's brilliantly called Uguisu No Fun.

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:24.760
 Right.

00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:28.440
 And apparently anyone around you, because you stink of shit.

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:29.440
 Yeah.

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:31.680
 Apparently, Victoria Beckham is a proponent of it.

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:32.680
 Oh, yeah.

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:33.680
 Wow.

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:34.680
 Okay.

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:35.680
 That's extreme.

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:39.000
 I read about the, uh, the crying therapy rooms, which seems really nice.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.680
 The whole idea is to make you a sad as you could possibly be.

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:46.680
 So you go in and you sit down and there's just sad movies playing on the screen and someone

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:49.280
 sits next to you, just going to ask really sad, isn't it?

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:52.000
 And then they hand you tissues as you're crying.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.680
 Just me.

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:56.680
 Okay.

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:57.680
 Give that one some bigger.

00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:58.680
 No, that sounds nice.

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:00.000
 So we've got to have a good cry.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000
 Yeah.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 Yeah.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.000
 Yeah.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000
 Yeah, I'd buy that.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 Just going back to Onsen.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:10.840
 So these baths, would you eat an Onsen Tamago, which is a traditional Japanese egg, which

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:13.760
 is cooked in a Onsen?

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:15.960
 You put your egg in a rope net.

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:20.200
 You put it in the Onsen and the water is about 70 degrees and you leave it in for 30 to

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:22.320
 40 minutes.

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:23.320
 And then it's done.

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:24.320
 Question.

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:25.320
 Yeah.

00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:27.560
 Because there are two ways of cooking eggs in water.

00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:29.480
 Shell on and shell off.

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:32.520
 So are we, are we poaching this bear boy or are we?

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:34.600
 This is, I believe it's shell on, I think.

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:35.600
 Oh, fine.

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:36.600
 Shell on.

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:37.600
 Wow.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:38.600
 There you go.

00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:39.600
 The audience has spoken shell on.

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:40.600
 But shell on.

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:41.600
 In it.

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:42.600
 It can be in a bath.

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:45.320
 It's not just a water bath, like a battery, it's an actual Onsen.

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:46.320
 Yeah.

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:50.280
 But also the eggs have a unique silky custard texture.

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:51.280
 I bet they do.

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:52.280
 Yeah.

00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:53.280
 I would eat that.

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:54.280
 I'm sorry.

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:56.160
 Can I just ask the person, was it a lady in the audience who said, "Chelon, have you

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:57.160
 had one of these?"

00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:58.160
 They're really good.

00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:59.160
 They're really good.

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:00.160
 There you go.

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:01.160
 Can't you?

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.160
 Like a poached egg.

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:04.760
 There's that like bit of white that never gets cooked and it's someone's like flamed

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:05.760
 on your plate.

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:06.760
 Oh, yeah.

00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:07.760
 Yeah, yeah.

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:09.360
 It looks like a dementor in the in the water as it's boiling.

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:11.360
 I've never seen a poached egg that hasn't got it.

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:12.360
 Why do we put order this?

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:13.360
 It's foul.

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:14.360
 Oh, I love a poached egg.

00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:15.360
 You do.

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:16.360
 Yeah.

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:19.360
 But they're just like, if it's in its wrapper, I don't mind where it's been.

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:20.360
 It's wrapped.

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:25.160
 I'd have a, I'd have a, if there was a banana, a banana in at the same time, pop that in

00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:26.160
 the net.

00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:27.160
 I don't mind.

00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:28.160
 Yeah.

00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:30.160
 Because it's been up her, up her chicken's bum, hasn't it?

00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:31.160
 You're right.

00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:32.160
 Let's not get fussy.

00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:33.160
 You know.

00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:35.800
 I wish I hadn't brought it up, I'll be honest.

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:36.800
 It's good.

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:38.680
 But I just want the other weird sparking.

00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:42.760
 There was that bullseemon hair treatment, right?

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:43.760
 Okay.

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.360
 I don't need about this in Chelsea.

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:46.360
 No?

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:47.360
 In Chelsea?

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:48.360
 Yeah.

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:49.360
 Okay.

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:52.360
 It was a hair mask, basically, in like 2008, 2009.

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:53.360
 Hair mask?

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:54.360
 Yeah.

00:34:54.360 --> 00:35:00.360
 It was this place called Harry's Salon in Chelsea, and it offered a 45-minute Aberdeen organic

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:10.440
 hair treatment, which was Aberdeen Angus, like good quality, bull come stuff, which women

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:15.360
 would like, I don't know, I guess, would pay like a lot of money to have, like, lathered over

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:16.360
 their hair.

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:17.360
 Yep.

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:20.480
 And would just like sit with it for 45 minutes, and apparently it was amazing.

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:21.480
 Really?

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:22.960
 And it made their hair silky and smooth, and...

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:26.120
 But I have made head-in shoulders two in one shampoo and conditioner, and that makes

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:27.640
 my hair silky and smooth.

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:31.120
 Andy, are there levels of silkeness and smoothness that I've not matched yet?

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:32.120
 You haven't lived.

00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:35.440
 I can imagine one of these women from Chelsea going into the countryside afterwards

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:39.960
 and walking through a field, and all the female cows are like, "Do you smell something?"

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:40.960
 Yeah.

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:49.120
 Well, it's funny to say that, because the people that ran this salon told the Metro a new

00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:51.880
 story, these pervert fraudsters, yeah, it's gone.

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:57.640
 These quacks said to the Metro that the seamen is refrigerated before use and doesn't smell.

00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:00.200
 I mean, it is come, but it's not, you know...

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:02.000
 It's not going to stay refrigerated.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000
 That's the problem.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.440
 The body heat is going to cause that to warm up.

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:07.200
 Yeah, but it's 45 minutes a minute.

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:11.000
 Look at, like, eating an egg from a buffoon of people, like, what do you mean?

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.000
 Look at all.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.400
 We do need to move on to our next factory, do we?

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:15.400
 No!

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:16.400
 Yeah, but we ran again.

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:17.400
 We didn't even touch...

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:21.400
 I've got the dreams of engineering stuff about how the Fukushima reactor dealt with its

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:23.800
 water after the terrible incident there.

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:24.800
 But I'll save it, I'll save it.

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:25.800
 You save it.

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:26.800
 It's fascinating.

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:27.800
 They built an underground wall with the ice.

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:28.800
 Oh, he's going for it.

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:29.800
 He's moving on.

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:37.400
 OK, we do need to move on.

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:39.600
 So it is time for fact number three.

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:40.600
 And that is...

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:41.600
 Oh, it's Andy.

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:50.880
 So, after the terrible incident at Fukushima, the engineers there pulled off a miracle, a miracle

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:52.400
 of preventing the radioactive.

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:53.400
 So they've got...

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:56.600
 Imagine a 1.5 kilometer radio circle.

00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:57.600
 Oh!

00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:00.200
 30 meters underground filled with frozen brine.

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:01.200
 Get off your phone!

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:02.200
 Come on!

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:04.000
 Help your phone!

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.800
 I can't start against shock of its 2 seconds.

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:07.800
 OK.

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:08.800
 Anyway.

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:09.800
 Sorry.

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:15.480
 My fact is, the first named man who sent a letter bomb only invented it to get back at people

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:19.040
 who had rejected all his other ideas for inventions.

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:20.040
 So...

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:21.040
 This is...

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:22.040
 Very funny.

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:24.040
 I love this guy.

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:25.880
 He's a very interesting historical figure.

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:30.160
 His name was Martin Eckenberg, and I was on the website of the Clapham Society, which

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:32.800
 is a great website, all about Clapham, which is a part of South London where I used

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:33.800
 to live.

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:38.160
 He was a Swedish scientist, Martin Eckenberg, born in 1870.

00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:43.080
 He was kind of, he was gifted inventor in some ways.

00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:48.560
 His ideas were decent, but the other problem that he had, personally, was that he was a liar,

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:49.560
 he was a cheat.

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:52.760
 He claimed qualifications he didn't have.

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:56.520
 He'd been kicked out of Sweden's Royal Institute of Technology, specifically for cheating.

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:57.520
 He was a badden.

00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:58.520
 He was a badden.

00:37:58.520 --> 00:37:59.520
 He was a badden.

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:00.520
 Fucking legend.

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:01.520
 So...

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:02.520
 Free thinker.

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:05.080
 Outside the box, kind of a liar.

00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:08.120
 But still, this didn't hold him back that much, because he moved to one of the nicest houses

00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:09.120
 in Clapham.

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:12.040
 It was this really beautiful mansion he moved to.

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:14.080
 That's not the point of the fact.

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:18.000
 It's been replaced by flats now, so you can't go and visit it, but if you would, that's

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.600
 weird, and you should be on a terror list.

00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:24.560
 And then in 1905, if you thought, right, I'm going to get revenge on everyone who's turned

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:27.200
 down my ideas along the way, who turned me down for finance.

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:30.600
 I am going to get back at you, and he's so basically created, started making his own

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:34.920
 letter bombs, and there were packages sent through the post to harm people before, but I think

00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:37.080
 he's the first name sort of, you know, like, prosecuted.

00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:38.560
 I think it was a bit unfair.

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:44.160
 So like the first person that he really sent it to was a guy called London, who ran this

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:45.160
 company.

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:49.800
 It was like an engineering company, and Eckenberg had invented something that could turn

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:55.120
 fish oil into engine oil, and he thought it was going to make his millions, but it failed.

00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:57.400
 And so he thought, well, I'm going to get this guy, London.

00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:01.800
 So the reason it failed is because the oil still smelled a fish.

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:05.040
 So like if people put it in the cars, the cars smelled a fish.

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.040
 Right.

00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:09.440
 I suppose if people are harries and get that sent removed, like the bullseamon.

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:13.040
 Well, no, the ships that was going to be used on ships, which have fish, obviously.

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:14.040
 That's true.

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:15.440
 Heads of the phrase, fish and ships.

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:18.840
 But yeah, that.

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:23.360
 And then this guy, London, opens the packet, and it said, I read an article in the newspaper

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:29.240
 that said, "It rumbled and shook like thunder." The director felt as if he had been hit by lightning

00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:31.320
 or tickled by lightning.

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:36.000
 An intense flame burst out the box and burned his hands, arms, chest and face terribly.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.480
 And his clothes went on fire.

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:42.080
 And the next day he got a postcard saying, "A former employee has decided that you're ripe

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:43.080
 for the picking."

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:44.080
 Yes.

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:47.840
 What's interesting is that it's not as if he sent it from the post in the UK, which would

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:49.240
 be more traceable.

00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:54.320
 He went by boat, back to Sweden, he assembled it there, sent it there and then went back home.

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:55.960
 So he really covered up his tracks.

00:39:55.960 --> 00:40:00.440
 But then he still set a postcard with his writing identifiable on it to the person he'd

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:01.440
 just...

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:02.440
 Yeah.

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:05.680
 I mean, he was caught for various quite stupid things like that.

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:06.680
 Yeah.

00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:09.080
 Can I just rescind that I thought he was good?

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:10.080
 No, no.

00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:13.080
 There's another thing as well, James, see if you still think he's good.

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:18.440
 So when he was arrested, he claimed innocence, and then he, according to the New York Times,

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:21.640
 he lost his reason and was taken to an asylum.

00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:27.520
 He died two months later, after his arrest, of what they said was apoplexy.

00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:32.080
 But the head of the Swedish detective service said that if he'd been sent back to Sweden,

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:35.240
 he would have also been tried for murdering his two wives.

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:36.240
 Oh.

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:37.240
 Right.

00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:38.240
 Yeah.

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:39.240
 No.

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:40.240
 Are you feeling sorry about that?

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:42.720
 Let's get a live reaction from Jamie Morden sitting right here.

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:43.720
 Sounds fine.

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:44.720
 Yeah.

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:45.720
 Not too sure.

00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:50.600
 What appears to have happened is he poisoned his first two wives, and then he bribed the

00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:54.440
 prison guards to get him the same poison which he then took himself.

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:55.440
 Yeah.

00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:56.440
 Yeah.

00:40:56.440 --> 00:41:01.600
 And interestingly today, if you go to the police museum and stock home, there's a giant wax

00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:07.640
 work, like a replica, human-sized wax replica of him standing there, and not only that, they

00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:09.760
 have a bunch of things that were to do with the case.

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:13.920
 So one of the bombings, which was sent to the Swedish Export Society, was opened up by

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:18.400
 a man called John Hammer, and John Hammer's thumb was blown off as part of opening the

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:19.400
 scene.

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:23.320
 And if you go to the police museum and stock home, you can see the wax work of Morden Eckenberg,

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:26.560
 and then you can see the actual thumb of John Hammer.

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:27.560
 Thumbs up or thumbs down.

00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:28.560
 It's the...

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:29.560
 Yeah.

00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:30.560
 It wasn't happy.

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:31.560
 It's a definite thumbs down for me.

00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:32.560
 Yeah.

00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:33.560
 So it's very, very grim guy.

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:35.680
 But it was an innovator of sorts.

00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:39.600
 And as I say, people had been sending devices designed to hurt other people through the

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:41.160
 post for ages, you know.

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:45.080
 So the very first one was a thing called the band box plot.

00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:49.780
 People were very worried about the week party in the, I think, 18th century, and supposedly

00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:53.360
 that party were involved in some attempts to assassinate people.

00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:54.360
 Get this.

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:58.360
 The very first ever thing sent through the post designed to harm someone, this band box plot,

00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:02.360
 was a box full of, I think, there's three pistols, but when you open it, they all go off

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:03.360
 at you.

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:04.360
 Wow.

00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:05.360
 I know.

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:06.360
 And it was...

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:07.360
 Oh, my God.

00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:09.200
 This is the story that it was thwarted by Jonathan Swift.

00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:15.080
 Well, the author of the travels, because he was a political figure as well, and he supposedly

00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:19.280
 noticed a thread on the box and cut it before opening it.

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:24.640
 Oh, so he's the first red wire blue wire cut moment that we've ever had for a bomb.

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:25.640
 Yeah.

00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:26.640
 Pretty cool.

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:27.680
 And we talk about his books instead.

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:28.680
 No, yeah.

00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:32.960
 But Eckenberg was the first of a kind of new wave where Gump Outer had been invented.

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:34.760
 The post had improved things like that.

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:38.640
 And so there were anarchists, people very, very worried about anarchists with their kind

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:40.880
 of cartoon-style bombs that they'd be throwing.

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:41.880
 Yeah.

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:46.600
 And he also invented a way to freeze dry milk, which is kind of similar to what we have today.

00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:49.960
 So like, you know, instant custard, we wouldn't have it without him.

00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:50.960
 Really?

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:51.960
 Well, Eckenberg.

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:52.960
 Wow.

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:53.960
 Jamie, you want to change your...

00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:56.480
 Because you're going off him, but I know you don't mind custard, do you know?

00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:57.480
 You don't have a bit of custard.

00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:58.480
 I mean, you know, I'm...

00:42:58.480 --> 00:42:59.480
 Because of 50/50.

00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:00.480
 It requires people.

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:05.120
 I'll tell you why I think he's not a complete villain.

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:11.720
 So interesting, which Hills people choose to die on.

00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:12.960
 I find that really fascinating.

00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:17.920
 I just kind of love the fact that like through revenge he invented something that was actually,

00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:22.040
 I mean, not a good thing, but was like a thing.

00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:25.360
 This silver lining is slimming down all the time.

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:26.360
 I got to say.

00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:29.640
 So it was for revenge, but he did invent something really bad.

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:35.640
 Well, maybe this is how my mind works. I mean, I got quite heavily into revenge during my

00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:36.720
 researching of this.

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:39.920
 So I was like, what else has revenge kind of created?

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:44.040
 And the rotary telephone is one thing that revenge has created.

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:45.040
 Yeah.

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:51.480
 Because there was a guy called Alman Stroudger, and he was an undertaker in the late 19th century

00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:52.480
 in Kansas City.

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:55.880
 They were all manual switchboards at that point, obviously.

00:43:55.880 --> 00:44:02.200
 And he thought that the switchboard operators were deliberately fiddling with his connections,

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:03.200
 because--

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:07.720
 Wait, so you would call up and say, patch me through to this person, right?

00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:14.240
 And he was convinced that this was being meddled with, because the other undertakers across

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:20.120
 the town, I think their wife worked at the phone company, so someone dies, you put them

00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:21.120
 through to--

00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:22.120
 Right.

00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:23.120
 To the rival.

00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:24.120
 And yeah, exactly.

00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:25.120
 So they were getting all the work.

00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:26.640
 So what's going on here?

00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:30.960
 And so he invented the rotary telephone to cut out the--

00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:32.480
 What's the one where you dial with it?

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:33.480
 Yeah, so you could dial it yourself.

00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:34.480
 That is amazing.

00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:35.480
 That's great.

00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:36.480
 It's not amazing.

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:37.480
 Right.

00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:38.480
 Revenge.

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:39.480
 But not all bad.

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:40.480
 Okay.

00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:41.480
 It's like those spite houses.

00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:42.480
 You know, spite houses.

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:46.200
 And it's just so cool that something that you build to screw someone over ends up being

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:47.720
 worth more than the house that--

00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:48.720
 Yeah, exactly.

00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:49.720
 Yeah, exactly.

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:50.880
 I just love stuff like that.

00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:55.800
 Just jumping back to Letterbombs for a second, I've discovered that the former prime minister--

00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:59.200
 well, a very long former prime minister, Anthony Eden.

00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:02.200
 So prime minister of England, he was almost killed by Letterbombs.

00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:03.200
 Is that so?

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:04.200
 Yeah.

00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:05.200
 And this was prior to him being prime minister.

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:12.320
 It was when he was foreign secretary, and someone had hand-delivered a Letterbombs.

00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:15.280
 He took it, but he thought, ah, this looks a bit boring.

00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:19.120
 So he put it in his briefcase, and he had it for 24 hours.

00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:20.120
 He went home.

00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:21.120
 He didn't open it.

00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:23.360
 He just had a whole day of not opening it.

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:24.360
 And then Scotland got--

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:25.360
 A letter looked boring.

00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:27.680
 Yeah, he thought it looked like a circular, like it looked like something that might have been

00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:28.680
 dropped off.

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:29.680
 Oh, yeah.

00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:30.680
 And it was a generic thing.

00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:31.680
 Yeah.

00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:35.080
 And so then Scotland Yard got in contact and said, we're worried that something might have

00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:36.960
 been sent to you that is a bomb.

00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:38.680
 And he still didn't look at it.

00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:42.960
 And it was his secretary who eventually went, that might be a bomb, and then--

00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:43.960
 And it was.

00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:47.600
 And so it was just purely his absolute boredom towards this letter that--

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:51.320
 Because that was an interesting letter he ever received.

00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:55.000
 And that's the thing is, they're designed to go off when you open them, aren't they?

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.520
 So you can carry them around.

00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:57.520
 Yeah.

00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:58.520
 And it's fine.

00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:03.160
 So, for instance, you're told that if you work in a government office and they might

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:06.720
 happen, a lot of people, when they get a letter that they're not sure about, they put

00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:07.720
 it in water.

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:10.200
 Because they think that's what you're supposed to do with a bomb, but you're absolutely not

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:11.200
 supposed to put it in water.

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:14.320
 Because some of the explosives will explode if you put them in a big--

00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:15.320
 Is that so?

00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:18.120
 I also renders the letter completely illegible.

00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:19.120
 Exactly.

00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:21.920
 I've got stupid idea.

00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:22.920
 There are some tips.

00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:23.920
 There are some useful tips, actually.

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:29.000
 So warning signs include, excess postage.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.760
 Like, why is someone spending so much money on their parcel?

00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:34.640
 Because you don't want to risk it getting returned to you, do you?

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:37.200
 Right.

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:39.480
 No return address.

00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:42.880
 So the really clever bombers will leave the return address off.

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:47.480
 I think I would put the return address as my number two nemesis.

00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:48.480
 Yeah, nice.

00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:49.480
 Such a good idea.

00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:50.480
 Yeah.

00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:52.480
 Such a good idea.

00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:53.480
 Number two.

00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:55.480
 What have you got?

00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:56.480
 It's a long old list.

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:57.480
 He's doing this.

00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:58.480
 He's doing this.

00:46:58.480 --> 00:46:59.480
 Bad spelling.

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:00.480
 Oh.

00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:02.480
 Because a lot of-- I mean, a lot of people sending these things are not the-- maybe.

00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:04.080
 I'm going to say, like, off letter bombs.

00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:06.480
 They're not the brightest buttons.

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:07.480
 Really?

00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:08.480
 Yeah, bad spelling.

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:10.480
 Because they've just constructed a bomb.

00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:12.480
 It feels like you've got a basic--

00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:13.080
 Get one.

00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:13.880
 What are you doing?

00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:17.080
 They might have studied the sciences and not the humanities.

00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:18.280
 Yes, that's the point.

00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:20.080
 There are so many kinds of intelligence.

00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:26.680
 Addressed personal, confidential, or do not x-ray.

00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:31.680
 That's wrong.

00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:34.480
 And the final one, just for any of that have slipped through those many holes

00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:40.080
 in the Swiss cheese, ticking sounds, protruding wires.

00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:41.080
 OK, yeah.

00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:42.080
 Or aluminium foil.

00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:44.880
 Or if it says "acme bomb" on the front.

00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:50.080
 If it's dropped off by a coyote who looks pleased with himself, that's another one.

00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:51.080
 I did read.

00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:54.880
 There was a-- what's the name of the journalist, Slasov Zizek?

00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:55.880
 Slasov Zizek.

00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:58.680
 Yeah, so he wrote this piece.

00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:01.880
 And the opening anecdote of the piece at the top winner in the contest

00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:05.880
 for the greatest blunder of 1998 was a Latin American patriotic terrorist

00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:09.680
 who sent a letter bomb to a US consulate in order to protest against America

00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:11.680
 interfering local politics.

00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:14.880
 As a conscientious citizen, he wrote his return address on the envelope.

00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:17.280
 However, he did not put enough stamps on it.

00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:19.680
 So that post was returned to him, forgetting he'd put it in.

00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:21.080
 He opened it and blew himself up.

00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:22.880
 He did, and he did what James said.

00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:23.880
 Yeah.

00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:26.280
 Now, who knows if that's apocryphal, but it's--

00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:26.880
 What's his name?

00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:28.880
 All the fingerprints of Jack Waz, anyway, near this.

00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:35.080
 I'll tell you what, that's the first time Jack Waz and Slasov Zizek

00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:37.080
 have been mentioned in the same sentence together.

00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:41.080
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:48.080
 It is time for our final fact of the show, and that is James.

00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:52.880
 OK, my fact this week is that there is currently a scandal in Thailand

00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:56.480
 after at least a dozen supposedly celibate monks

00:48:56.480 --> 00:49:00.680
 admitted to having sex with a woman called Mrs. Golf.

00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:04.480
 James, you're a keen golfer.

00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:05.480
 That's how I found this.

00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:07.280
 I was googling gol.

00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:10.680
 No, no, no.

00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:14.480
 No, I just read this in the news, and I thought it's very amusing.

00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:16.440
 It is a lot of senior monks.

00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:18.680
 I mean, not amusing, if you're a monk,

00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:21.440
 because obviously a lot of them have lost their livelihoods,

00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:24.680
 including some as high ranking as frat dep,

00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:26.760
 which means angelic level.

00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:29.280
 So this goes to the very, very top.

00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:31.600
 And it turns out they've been having relationships

00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:33.880
 with this woman, who's called Mrs. Golf,

00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:36.200
 and they've been transferring money to her.

00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:39.000
 And they've found this lady, and they've found

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:43.800
 over 80,000 photos of naked monks on her phone.

00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:45.440
 How do they know they're monks?

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:47.160
 [LAUGHTER]

00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:48.920
 Sorry to quibble.

00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:51.240
 I reckon there's a way.

00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:52.240
 You reckon there's a way?

00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:52.760
 It's probably a way.

00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:53.880
 I reckon there's a way.

00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:55.840
 Probably it's the hair style down there.

00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:56.840
 It's like a tontia.

00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:59.800
 It's like a tontia.

00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:00.800
 80,000 is a lot.

00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:02.800
 Not necessarily all different monks.

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:04.240
 They could have been--

00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:06.760
 I don't even know if I have that amount of storage on my phone

00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:07.520
 for 80,000 photos.

00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:08.720
 Yes, what was her data plan like?

00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:10.760
 This is really interesting.

00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:11.720
 Is she in the cloud?

00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:13.200
 She's using the cloud.

00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:15.960
 So yeah, and the reason she's called Mrs. Golf

00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:18.440
 is because this is like common in Thailand

00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:21.000
 for people to have little short nicknames.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:24.440
 And you're kind of given them as a child by your parents.

00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:26.560
 And they don't really mean anything.

00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:28.920
 It might be that this person's parents love golf,

00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:33.480
 but more likely, they just take a Western word that kind

00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:35.400
 of sounds fun or trendy or whatever.

00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:36.640
 And they just call that.

00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:39.120
 The most famous Thai person in the world probably

00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:40.520
 is Lisa from Blackpink.

00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:42.440
 And her nickname is Pockpack.

00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:46.440
 Lisa from Blackpink, the band.

00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:47.680
 So it's just like--

00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:50.960
 [LAUGHTER]

00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:52.840
 James, earlier in the show, I thought Taylor Swift

00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:54.160
 was getting married to Kelsey Grammar.

00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:58.480
 So let's just modulate--

00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:00.400
 like, what we think I'm going to know.

00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:04.320
 So they're just--

00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:06.560
 mostly just sounds, or they might be little words

00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:09.320
 from other languages, but it's just like a little nickname.

00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:10.960
 But people go by it in real life.

00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:13.320
 Like, as adults, you might still be known as that nickname.

00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:14.320
 Yeah.

00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:17.920
 But so this is an unbelievably fascinating story.

00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:22.200
 This one woman went around so many of these different monasteries

00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:24.680
 and managed to talk in what were effectively--

00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:26.400
 I'm assuming, celibate monks--

00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:30.640
 into engaging, not only in sex, but also having photos taken.

00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:33.280
 And the top monks, some of them, have fled the country.

00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:34.600
 We don't know quite where they are.

00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:36.480
 And they haven't said why they've done that.

00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:40.640
 They're now investigating 300,000 other Buddhist monks

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:43.240
 in Thailand off the back of this to see whether or not

00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:43.960
 they're involved.

00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:46.640
 And she got a lot of money off the back of this.

00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:48.240
 Was her own extortion?

00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:49.680
 Sort of, I'll release the photos.

00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:51.200
 So the photos would be shown back to them,

00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:52.400
 and then they would have to pay money.

00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:54.320
 And a lot of the monks have been acquitted

00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:57.040
 where the police have decided that actually you just

00:51:57.040 --> 00:51:59.960
 gave her money because she was pleading for the money

00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:02.200
 and didn't engage in sexual activity.

00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:02.720
 And trust me.

00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:04.760
 But you know how much money, allegedly,

00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:11.160
 she has netted the equivalent of $11.9 million from this.

00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:12.960
 There's a lot of money in munking, isn't there?

00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:14.320
 Isn't there?

00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:16.760
 Yeah, that's a bigger career than I thought.

00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:20.280
 Like, no, my career advisor did not say,

00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:22.080
 have you considered becoming a monk?

00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:23.560
 And I think it's quite a big deal.

00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:26.680
 In Thailand, because if you're a Buddhist,

00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:28.680
 you think that if someone becomes a monk,

00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:30.680
 then they kind of automatically sort of

00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:34.040
 develop this strong resistance to temptation

00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:35.240
 and that kind of thing.

00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:37.000
 And so to find out that they haven't

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.080
 was quite a big deal for a lot of people.

00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:39.840
 Yeah.

00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:41.240
 I think this is very interesting, because I

00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:44.120
 started reading about, by the way, James,

00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:46.960
 there's a very hard factor, Google, like naughty monks.

00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:50.400
 And naughty nuns is actually even worse.

00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:53.320
 It's an even harder legit Google.

00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:56.920
 But basically, there was a lot of this in the 16th century

00:52:56.920 --> 00:53:01.800
 in England, because monks and nuns and monasteries and nunneries

00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:03.600
 were seen as hoppets of sin.

00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:05.680
 And the idea was they're all on the take.

00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:09.120
 They're all selling, pardoning for sins, that kind of thing.

00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:11.520
 Like, they're all, and they're all shacking up.

00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:12.920
 And there were some institutions--

00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:14.160
 Cancer Reformation.

00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:15.200
 Cancer Reformation, right.

00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:17.960
 But I think we've all been conned into thinking

00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:20.800
 that monks and nuns are inherently sort of naughty figures,

00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:22.280
 because they're absolutely not.

00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:25.400
 And I think we fall off a Henry VIII era propaganda.

00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:26.560
 And I'm blowing the lid off this.

00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:30.360
 Not enough people talk about it, but I'm not afraid to.

00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:33.280
 I'd just like to reference the paper by Christian Knudsen,

00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:35.960
 Sodomitic monks and other dissolution myths,

00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:38.760
 the late medieval monastic decline narrative revisited.

00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:39.960
 And it is a belting read.

00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:41.200
 It's really good.

00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:43.440
 And it's-- can you tell us more about the Fukushima

00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:43.920
 disaster?

00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:53.360
 But like, Henry VIII wanted to dissolve the monasteries.

00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:57.080
 Because they owned a huge proportion of English land.

00:53:57.080 --> 00:53:58.560
 There was so wealthy.

00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:00.800
 And Henry VIII thought I'm going to discredit

00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:03.320
 ecclesiastical institutions any way I can.

00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:06.880
 And every monastery in England, in 1535 and '65,

00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:09.320
 got a visit from bureaucrats who were trying to record

00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:12.720
 every dubious incidence of behavior by a monk or a nun

00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:13.640
 they could.

00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:15.320
 And there were some cases--

00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:16.400
 absolutely, there were some cases

00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:18.880
 where monks had been playing the field or whatever it is.

00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:21.600
 But they also-- they had to come up with new crimes.

00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:22.960
 So they found dozens of instances

00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:25.600
 recorded of voluntary pollution, which

00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:26.920
 is just sort of playing with yourself.

00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:31.840
 But it's not-- in one priori, West Acres, 76% of the monks

00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:33.720
 were labeled incontinent by which they mean

00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:36.320
 romantically incontinent.

00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:38.440
 But 10 of those 13 were for just enjoying

00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:40.480
 some sort of cowl billiards.

00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:43.680
 And so it's not cow-- the cow goes in your head, doesn't it?

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:45.040
 You know what I mean?

00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:45.720
 Hardly ever.

00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:49.240
 [LAUGHTER]

00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:50.520
 I just think it's really interesting.

00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:52.080
 And I think we shouldn't fall for it.

00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:53.320
 OK, well, we won't.

00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:56.560
 [LAUGHTER]

00:54:56.560 --> 00:54:58.000
 But also, I'm a Catholic.

00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.600
 I mean, you know, lapsed Catholic.

00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:01.080
 Like, you can do anything if you say sorry.

00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:02.320
 That's like the point.

00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:03.160
 Yes.

00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:04.600
 But actually--

00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:07.680
 The penance was quite severe, where it could be.

00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:11.480
 So Richard Gray, one man called Richard Gray in Medieval England,

00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:13.840
 he was found guilty of having sex with a nun.

00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:16.200
 And he was sentenced to being flogged while walking

00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:19.320
 around Stanford Church on four Sundays in a row,

00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:23.040
 carrying a candle while dressed only in linen garments.

00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:25.640
 And then he had to make a barefoot pilgrimage

00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:28.560
 to Lincoln Cathedral, from where?

00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:31.000
 Wherever he lived.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:34.400
 Wow, that's a movable feast of a punishment, isn't it?

00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:35.640
 I just want to feed you all right.

00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:37.680
 I'm going to get a flat just outside Lincoln.

00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:40.960
 [LAUGHTER]

00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:43.400
 Yeah, that was quite a mess for me to not say

00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:45.840
 where he actually lived in my notes.

00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:47.040
 But then--

00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:50.200
 And then after that, he didn't do what he was supposed to do,

00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:52.200
 and they've excommunicated him.

00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:53.800
 But in those days, being excommunicated

00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:54.880
 was a big, old deal.

00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:55.880
 Right.

00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:57.560
 Because it means you can't go to heaven,

00:55:57.560 --> 00:55:59.440
 but also means you can't be baptized.

00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:00.520
 Means you can't get married.

00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:03.080
 You can't do all sorts of different things.

00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:04.480
 Yeah, and actually, quite often,

00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:06.240
 the women were punished more than the men.

00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:09.280
 So two that happened quite close to each other,

00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:12.840
 a guy called Nicholas Plymouth, was a monk who

00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:15.760
 has committed adultery with a Tanner's wife.

00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:19.080
 And he was ordered to remain silent for one week.

00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:20.880
 And around the same time, someone

00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:22.840
 called Alice Longspray was sentenced

00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:26.120
 to a year of strict confinement after an affair

00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:26.840
 with a priest.

00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:27.840
 It's double standards.

00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:29.240
 So it is double standards, yeah.

00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:29.760
 Yeah.

00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:32.240
 James, you've spent time in Bhutan.

00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:32.800
 I have.

00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:35.800
 Did you ever hear of the thunderbolt of flaming wisdom

00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:36.960
 while you were out there?

00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:38.560
 That's what they still call me, then.

00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:41.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:43.680
 I wonder when the thunderbolt of flaming wisdom

00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:46.440
 is going to return.

00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:51.400
 So it's referring to amongst penis,

00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:51.960
 but--

00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:56.800
 [LAUGHTER]

00:56:56.800 --> 00:57:00.000
 So a question who your real friends were out there.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:04.040
 But it was strange that they yelled at me at the streets.

00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:06.720
 [LAUGHTER]

00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:07.320
 Is that right?

00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:11.080
 There was this guy, Druckper Cunley, and he was in the 1400s.

00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:12.360
 Yeah, I'd been to his church.

00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:13.520
 You've been to his church.

00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:15.120
 So he was interesting, because he

00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:18.120
 was known as the Saint of 5,000 women.

00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:20.080
 He was a fertility saint.

00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:21.640
 The idea was he thought sex should

00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:24.280
 be incorporated into reaching enlightenment.

00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:25.120
 And so--

00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:25.920
 Oh, right.

00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:27.360
 So classic.

00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:27.880
 Oh, yeah.

00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:30.280
 Yeah, you would meet the thunderbolt of flaming wisdom

00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:33.320
 as part of your hello to him, basically.

00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:37.440
 And he was liked, but mad as fuck.

00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:39.760
 Like, people genuinely thought he was.

00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:40.280
 And what I--

00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:42.160
 It's known as like the Holy Mad Man or something like that.

00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:42.680
 Yeah.

00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:44.480
 And he introduced this idea, which still

00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:46.720
 goes on in various bits of Bhutan today,

00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:48.960
 which is that if you're setting up a new house

00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:51.320
 and you need it to be blessed, you would basically

00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:54.440
 graffiti, fallists, put dig picks, all over--

00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:56.520
 like draw a penis, all over the walls.

00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:57.240
 Did you see any--

00:57:57.240 --> 00:58:00.080
 Well, yeah, yeah, they're on every house, has them.

00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:00.600
 Yeah.

00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:02.920
 In this particular town where he was from.

00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:05.120
 And also, if you go into his church,

00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:07.680
 priest comes up to you with a giant fallace

00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:09.400
 and sort of touches you as if you'd

00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:11.200
 been knighted by the queen.

00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:12.320
 Rise.

00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:13.080
 Did you have that?

00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:13.600
 Yeah.

00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:14.200
 Wow.

00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:14.680
 Cool.

00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:15.200
 Arise.

00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:20.480
 If it's on every house, can you put it on a semi?

00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:21.000
 Sorry.

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:21.520
 Go on.

00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:25.240
 Well, so it's pretty fascinating.

00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:27.160
 It sounds like modern Bhutan really

00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:29.320
 is for the people who are less connected to that,

00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:32.600
 slightly embarrassed by the fact that penises are everywhere.

00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:35.000
 I'll be honest, they take every tourist there.

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:35.600
 Right, OK.

00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:38.680
 Because it is, like, it's Instagram central, you know,

00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:40.760
 like lots of houses with penises on them.

00:58:40.760 --> 00:58:41.760
 Yeah, interesting.

00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:42.080
 Yeah.

00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:44.720
 But I did also play golf with my monks.

00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:47.400
 So I say my monks, like, the monks take you around

00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:48.400
 the same time.

00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:49.640
 You're not allowed to just walk around.

00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:51.680
 They give you a couple of monks who kind of take you

00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:52.640
 everywhere.

00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:53.960
 And I asked if I could play golf.

00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:55.480
 And apparently, no one really asked that.

00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:56.840
 But I was in the Himalayas, so they

00:58:56.840 --> 00:59:00.120
 has really thin, so the ball goes miles.

00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:01.640
 Oh, but if you get it wrong.

00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:02.640
 Surely.

00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:03.160
 Yeah.

00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:04.440
 And also today, I've learned that I

00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:08.760
 got a very high dose of radiation that day.

00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:11.640
 And then I did karaoke with them, as well, with the monks.

00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:14.360
 Like, all the monks came together in a bar in the evening.

00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:15.480
 And they went with them.

00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:16.920
 And we-- and sang karaoke.

00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:18.240
 What was that go-to song?

00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:19.240
 Come on, come on.

00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:22.000
 I sang it in Bhutanese, so I didn't really understand it.

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:23.040
 What did they sing?

00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:25.040
 They were all the songs were in Bhutanese.

00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:25.840
 I will survive.

00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:26.640
 Got to be I will survive.

00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:27.640
 Yeah.

00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:28.640
 Yeah.

00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:30.880
 Do you want to know something cool about the first century

00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:31.880
 St. Thecla?

00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:32.880
 Yes, please.

00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:33.880
 Yes, please.

00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:34.880
 This was sent in by a listener, actually.

00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:35.880
 Listen to Kat Brinker.

00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:36.880
 So thanks Kat for this.

00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:39.160
 This is the first century St. Thecla.

00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:43.000
 She is the unofficial patron saint of computers and the internet.

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:44.000
 Can you work out why?

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.360
 It's going to be sex-connected, presumably.

00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:47.360
 Nope.

00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:48.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:50.360
 But you said it was to do with the internet.

00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:51.360
 No, I know.

00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:52.360
 I know.

00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:54.360
 What did the first century monk have to do with computers

00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:55.360
 and the internet?

00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:56.360
 She liked cats.

00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:58.160
 That's a really good one.

00:59:58.160 --> 00:59:59.400
 That's very close.

00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:01.680
 She was very racist all the time.

01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:02.680
 No.

01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:03.680
 [LAUGHTER]

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:10.120
 It's because her name Thecla sounds like the Spanish word for a key on a keyboard.

01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:11.120
 Thecla.

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:12.120
 Oh, OK.

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:13.120
 Thecla.

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:14.120
 You've not just wasted their time.

01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:15.120
 [LAUGHTER]

01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:16.120
 Unbelievable.

01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:25.120
 If you'd like to know some other grabs of the word Thecla, I've got loads.

01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:29.680
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:30.600
 We've got to wrap up.

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:31.760
 We need to wrap up our show.

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:32.600
 What is for the shame?

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:37.040
 [LAUGHTER]

01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:41.960
 However, before we wrap up tonight, so we've got one last thing to do, which is our brilliant

01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:46.400
 giant sperm donor over there is going to come on stage.

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:47.400
 You could have quit.

01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:49.440
 It's going to arrive on stage.

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:56.440
 And, James, you're going to be hosting a quiz, right?

01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:57.200
 Yes, I am.

01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:59.680
 Yes, so is it James as well?

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:00.880
 Come on up, James.

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:03.680
 What we're going to do is we're going to do a little quiz and we're going to put you up

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:05.520
 against Jamie Martin.

01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:07.880
 How well do you know those things are fish, James?

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:08.760
 Very well, yeah.

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:10.320
 Yes, Jamie?

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:11.120
 Not at all.

01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:13.280
 [LAUGHTER]

01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:18.000
 Well, I've been on it three times, three or four times, and that's it.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.080
 OK.

01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:22.560
 These questions will not refer to any time you were on the show, Jamie.

01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:26.200
 But I do know you guys, so in theory, it should balance out.

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:30.320
 Absolutely, because the quiz is going to be things that we have mentioned about ourselves

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:31.640
 on the podcast.

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:36.920
 I'm going to say a statement that one of us has said, and it's up to you to decide which

01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:37.920
 of us said it.

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:40.760
 Now, Jamie, if you don't remember our names, just point at us.

01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:41.760
 Great.

01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:42.760
 OK.

01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:43.760
 The guy in the hat.

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:44.760
 Can I confer?

01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:45.760
 No.

01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:46.760
 Because Dan will--

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:47.760
 No.

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:49.080
 [LAUGHTER]

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:50.480
 Dan knows it's so less than me.

01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:54.800
 So what we're going to do is we're going to do three questions, because one of the questions

01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:58.240
 I have is something that we've just mentioned on the podcast today.

01:01:58.240 --> 01:01:59.480
 So I can't do that one.

01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:00.760
 We'll do three each.

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:02.160
 Hopefully it won't be a tie.

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:03.800
 That's all I could say.

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:06.840
 So first of all, this is to you, James.

01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:07.520
 OK.

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:09.920
 Which of us, on those six fingers of fish, it can't be Anna.

01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:11.520
 It's going to be me and the Ordan.

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:16.080
 Which of us said, I slept in a church for a fortnight?

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:16.840
 James.

01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:17.840
 Me?

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:18.840
 Yeah.

01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:19.840
 It was not me.

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:21.800
 Dan, was it you?

01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:23.840
 I don't think so.

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:24.840
 [LAUGHTER]

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:27.920
 I really hope this is you and the otherwise the whole quiz has gone to shit.

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:28.920
 But, was it you?

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:29.920
 Yeah, I think it was.

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:30.920
 Yeah.

01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:31.920
 It was me.

01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:32.920
 It was Andy.

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:33.920
 Yeah, yeah.

01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:34.920
 You think it was--

01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:35.920
 [LAUGHTER]

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:36.920
 Something you'd remember.

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:37.920
 It was me.

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:38.920
 It was me.

01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:39.920
 Two weeks, living in a church.

01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:40.920
 Not living.

01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:41.920
 Sleeping?

01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:42.920
 Sleeping?

01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:43.920
 Right.

01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:44.920
 You're resting?

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:45.920
 Yeah.

01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:46.920
 It was a charity thing.

01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:47.920
 It was fun.

01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:48.920
 Yeah.

01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:49.920
 memorable.

01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:50.920
 Cool.

01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:54.920
 He's got 80,000 photos of the priest to prove it.

01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:57.920
 So, Andy, are you going to do the scars for us?

01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:59.920
 I have to keep score and hold a microphone in one hand.

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:00.920
 I'm not sure I can.

01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:02.920
 Did anybody got that one?

01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:03.920
 OK, so the score is?

01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:04.920
 Love all.

01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:05.920
 Great.

01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:06.920
 Yep.

01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:07.920
 OK, question number two.

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:08.920
 This is for Jamie.

01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:09.920
 Which of us said this?

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:14.920
 Before I moved to London, I was heavily involved in the hedge community.

01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:18.920
 Which was, was into hedges.

01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:19.920
 Hedge community.

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:20.920
 Yeah.

01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:23.920
 Do I look like a man who's into hedges?

01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:25.920
 I'm going to be honest and say you do.

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:28.920
 [LAUGHTER]

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:31.920
 But what a lovely pastime.

01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:34.920
 Just to make it fair, I'll say Andy.

01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:37.920
 Andy, have you ever not lived in London?

01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:38.920
 No.

01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:40.920
 Oh.

01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:41.920
 It was me.

01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:42.920
 What's the story, James?

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:43.920
 There's no story.

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:44.920
 I just liked hedges.

01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:48.920
 No, I got, I lived in the countryside and someone came around and said,

01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:50.920
 would you be interested in giving us some money for hedges?

01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:51.920
 And I said, no.

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:52.920
 And they said, what about time?

01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:55.920
 And I felt so bad that I spent a lot of time fixing hedges.

01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:56.920
 Cutting hedges.

01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:57.920
 Not cutting them.

01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:58.920
 Not cutting them.

01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:00.920
 Just sort of going around asking people to pay money.

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:01.920
 Oh.

01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:03.920
 Oh, that sounds like a pyramid scheme.

01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:05.920
 [LAUGHTER]

01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:07.920
 OK, this one is for you, James.

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:08.920
 Yeah.

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:09.920
 OK, who said this?

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:12.920
 I have an unbeatable arm wrestling technique.

01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:15.920
 But can't do it anymore due to injuries.

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:17.920
 Oh, I'm going to go for Dan.

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:20.920
 It's a few murmurs of yes in the audience.

01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:21.920
 Dan, how's your arm wrestling?

01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:23.920
 Pretty damn good.

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:25.920
 But can anyone beat you?

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:26.920
 Uh, yeah.

01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:27.920
 So many people.

01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:28.920
 Yeah.

01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:29.920
 Yeah.

01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:31.920
 Andy, there's no point asking you, is there?

01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:35.920
 [LAUGHTER]

01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:39.920
 Does anyone truly think it's Andy?

01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:40.920
 Andy, was it you?

01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:41.920
 I don't know.

01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:42.920
 No, it wasn't.

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:43.920
 It's me.

01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:44.920
 It's me, my arm.

01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:45.920
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:46.920
 Wow.

01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:49.920
 It's just a trick you stand on the right part of the table and you can't lose.

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:50.920
 Anyway.

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:52.920
 How did you injury-- how did you-- how do you--

01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:54.920
 I guess a very good arm wrestler.

01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:55.920
 Oh, it wasn't.

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:56.920
 It wasn't, it wasn't.

01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:59.920
 You can also rip a yellow pages book in half, just like on the spot.

01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:00.920
 It's really exciting.

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:01.920
 But they've stopped making those books now.

01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:02.920
 So yellow pages.

01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:03.920
 Boomer.

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:04.920
 Yeah.

01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:05.920
 [LAUGHTER]

01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:08.920
 Now all my phone numbers are on my phone and you can't rip that in half.

01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:09.920
 No.

01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:12.920
 OK, whichever said this, I got married--

01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:15.920
 sorry, this is for Jamie and Andy Watt's score.

01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:17.920
 I think you just got one right, didn't you, James?

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:18.920
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:19.920
 I think James is what--

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:20.920
 James is what--

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:21.920
 I think.

01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:22.920
 [LAUGHTER]

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:24.920
 This is how I got new to my scoring.

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:26.920
 James is one no ahead.

01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:27.920
 Final answer.

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:33.920
 Is this someone scoring my scoring, please?

01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:34.920
 There's an absolute shambles.

01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:35.920
 OK.

01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:37.920
 Jamie Martin, who said this?

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:43.920
 I got married in a room where the Earl of Sandwich invented the sandwich.

01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:46.920
 Now, were you any of our weddings?

01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:49.920
 No, I didn't get-- I knew you before you were--

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:50.920
 Oh, no, you didn't.

01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:51.920
 We knew each other.

01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:52.920
 It became happy.

01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:53.920
 [LAUGHTER]

01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:55.920
 We knew each other, and I had two weddings.

01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:57.920
 And not invited to either, thanks.

01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:58.920
 We were friends, though.

01:05:58.920 --> 01:05:59.920
 We knew each other, but we weren't like--

01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:00.920
 That's right.

01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:02.920
 And the same wife, by the way.

01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:04.920
 I just want to point that out.

01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:07.920
 We won a free wedding in a magazine.

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:10.920
 And then so we had our first wedding, and then we did a second wedding two days later.

01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:11.920
 It was insane.

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:13.920
 And was it anywhere near the other sandwich?

01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:16.920
 [LAUGHTER]

01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:17.920
 I can't remember.

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:18.920
 We definitely had sandwich.

01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:19.920
 That's kind of the other thing.

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:20.920
 What's going on?

01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:21.920
 OK, sorry.

01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:28.920
 So someone got married near the room where the Earl of Sandwich invented the sandwich.

01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:29.920
 I'm hearing--

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:30.920
 I'm not going to say Andy.

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:31.920
 OK.

01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:32.920
 Andy, what's it you?

01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:33.920
 Certainly was.

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:34.920
 Yes.

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:35.920
 Yeah.

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:36.920
 Very nice.

01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:37.920
 I ran the applause.

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:38.920
 Thanks.

01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:39.920
 Yeah.

01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:41.920
 For a completely random one in three guests.

01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:43.920
 I think they just happy that he's married.

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:44.920
 I think it was for--

01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:46.920
 [LAUGHTER]

01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:47.920
 Sorry, ladies.

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:51.920
 [LAUGHTER]

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:52.920
 OK.

01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:55.920
 I like the room where the Earl of Sandwich invented the sandwich.

01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:56.920
 Amazing.

01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:57.920
 And was that a deliberate choice?

01:06:57.920 --> 01:06:59.920
 Did you choose it because of the sandwich connection?

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:00.920
 Of course.

01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:01.920
 Yeah.

01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:04.920
 Is this marriage right at the end of the two-week sleepover that you had in the show?

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:06.920
 [LAUGHTER]

01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:07.920
 OK.

01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:08.920
 So what's the score, Andy?

01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:09.920
 One all.

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:11.920
 [LAUGHTER]

01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:12.920
 I'm so sure of it.

01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:13.920
 I'm really happy.

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:14.920
 OK.

01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:15.920
 The next question.

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:16.920
 Four James.

01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:17.920
 This is your last question, in fact.

01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:18.920
 Oh, God.

01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:20.920
 Who said this on the podcast?

01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:24.920
 As a child, people always told me I smelled of milk.

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:26.920
 [LAUGHTER]

01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:29.920
 It sounds ridiculous, but I'm going to go for down again.

01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:31.920
 Daniel Shriver.

01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:35.920
 As a child, did everyone tell you that you smelled of milk?

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:36.920
 They sure did.

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:37.920
 [LAUGHTER]

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:43.920
 [APPLAUSE]

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:45.920
 Expand, explain.

01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:47.920
 We'll have a sniff and see if I'm still--

01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:48.920
 I try to.

01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:49.920
 No, that's bullsemen.

01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:50.920
 [LAUGHTER]

01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:52.920
 Famously odeless.

01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:53.920
 OK.

01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:55.920
 Final question for Jamie.

01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:56.920
 And it's two-one.

01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:57.920
 It's two-one.

01:07:57.920 --> 01:07:59.920
 [LAUGHTER]

01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:01.920
 Please get this wrong.

01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:03.920
 Who on the podcast said this?

01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:08.920
 I love to watch Oprah Winfrey clips of military homecoming

01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:10.920
 videos to make myself cry.

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:18.920
 [LAUGHTER]

01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:20.920
 I actually need to go.

01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:23.920
 But this has been really fun.

01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:27.920
 You're looking at three very emotionally sensitive men.

01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:28.920
 Clearly.

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:29.920
 Could be anyone.

01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:30.920
 Four.

01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:31.920
 Oprah Winfrey.

01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:32.920
 [LAUGHTER]

01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:34.920
 Thank you.

01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:37.920
 James, it was not me.

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:41.920
 I have never cried in my life.

01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:42.920
 Andrew Hunter Murray.

01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:43.920
 Are you the funsome cryer?

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:44.920
 Nope.

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:46.920
 Daniel Shriver.

01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:48.920
 Huh?

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:49.920
 Shut up, whatever.

01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:50.920
 Yes, OK.

01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:52.920
 I watch Oprah Winfrey clips and cry.

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:54.920
 There's one where someone bought her shoes and they stand in them

01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:56.920
 so they could feel like Oprah.

01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:57.920
 It's so emotional.

01:08:57.920 --> 01:08:59.920
 [LAUGHTER]

01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:00.920
 OK.

01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:02.920
 So that's the end of the quiz.

01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:03.920
 I do believe.

01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:04.920
 Andrew Hunter Murray.

01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:05.920
 Do we have a winner?

01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:06.920
 We do.

01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:07.920
 And it's James.

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:08.920
 The winner!

01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:09.920
 James!

01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:11.920
 Ladies and gentlemen!

01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:14.920
 [APPLAUSE]

01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:18.920
 Well, James, we're very excited to announce that we forgot

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:19.920
 what prize to get you.

01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:23.920
 And therefore, we'll take your details and give you something later.

01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:25.920
 [LAUGHTER]

01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:28.920
 But for now, for everyone in the room, that is it.

01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:29.920
 That is all of our facts.

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:30.920
 Thank you so much for listening.

01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:33.920
 Thank you for everyone who has joined us around the world

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:34.920
 on the livestream.

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:37.920
 We are all found on our online accounts.

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:39.920
 You can get us on Instagram.

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:40.920
 I'm there.

01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:41.920
 I'm on @ShriverLand.

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:42.920
 James.

01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:43.920
 I'm on TikTok.

01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:44.920
 No, since James Harkin.

01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:45.920
 Andy.

01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:46.920
 I need to go up Mrs. Golf.

01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:49.920
 [LAUGHTER]

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:51.920
 80,000 photos on his grid.

01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:52.920
 It's insane.

01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:53.920
 [LAUGHTER]

01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:54.920
 It's too much, mate.

01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:55.920
 It's too much.

01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:56.920
 And Jamie.

01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:57.920
 Uncle Ego.

01:09:57.920 --> 01:09:58.920
 It's weird.

01:09:58.920 --> 01:09:59.920
 Don't worry.

01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:00.920
 [LAUGHTER]

01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:01.920
 OK.

01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:04.920
 And if you want to send us any of your facts,

01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:08.920
 you can do that as well by going to podcast@QI.com.

01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:09.920
 So send us facts.

01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:11.920
 Send us anything that you heard in this episode

01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:12.920
 that you want to talk about.

01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:15.920
 We take it all and we bring it to our special secret room,

01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:16.920
 which is part of Club Fish.

01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:18.920
 We got any Club Fish members here?

01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:19.920
 [CHEERING]

01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:20.920
 Six.

01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:21.920
 OK.

01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:22.920
 Everybody.

01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:24.920
 [LAUGHTER]

01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:26.920
 But we will read them out there as part of our Mailbag Specials.

01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:27.920
 So do do that.

01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:28.920
 Go online.

01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:31.920
 Find out if we're coming to a town near you with more live shows.

01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:35.920
 But otherwise, come back here next week for more of our actual show.

01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:36.920
 It's all free.

01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:37.920
 Come and do that.

01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:38.920
 Thank you so much.

01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:39.920
 Everyone for being here tonight.

01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:40.920
 London podcast festival.

01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:41.920
 That was awesome.

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:42.920
 We will see you again.

01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:43.920
 Goodbye.

01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:45.920
 Goodbye.

01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:48.920
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:51.920
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:54.500
 (upbeat music)
