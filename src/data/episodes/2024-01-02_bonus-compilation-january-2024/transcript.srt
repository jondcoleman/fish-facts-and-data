1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,760
 - Hey, Club Fish members.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:08,760
 It's Dan here.

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:09,840
 Happy New Year.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,920
 Happy New Year, everyone.

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,640
 Welcome to 2024.

7
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,040
 Very exciting.

8
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,960
 This is actually gonna be quite a big year for fish.

9
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,480
 It's our 10-year anniversary in March.

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,200
 I can't believe we've been going 10 years.

11
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,040
 But we have.

12
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,200
 Thanks to everyone who's been listening since the get-go.

13
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,840
 And thanks to everyone who's just joined.

14
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,160
 We've got a lot of exciting things

15
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,520
 that we're hopefully gonna be doing this year.

16
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,840
 So it's gonna be a great time to be a member of Club Fish.

17
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,120
 So thank you for continuing to join us here

18
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,160
 for all these weird bonus bits of content and so on.

19
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,880
 Today we've got a compilation for you.

20
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,600
 It's a compilation entirely with Anna.

21
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,480
 We finished our run of all the special guests.

22
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,080
 And now we're just getting the outtakes with Anna Tyshinski.

23
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,640
 And having listened to this episode just now,

24
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,480
 she's as brutal in the outtakes as she is in the main show.

25
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,480
 So I know you're gonna enjoy that.

26
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,960
 So yeah, let's make this an awesome year.

27
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,160
 Hope you had a great Christmas.

28
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,520
 Whatever festival you celebrate in that time of the year.

29
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,800
 Hope New Year's was fun and mad and awesome.

30
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,480
 And yeah, let's hit the compilation.

31
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,400
 And we start with an outtake from an episode

32
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,360
 where we were talking about the author, Wilkie Collins.

33
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,200
 Here we go.

34
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,160
 Can we talk a bit about Wilkie Collins?

35
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,000
 I love this tiny thing.

36
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,560
 He was such a good storyteller even as a child

37
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,720
 that when he was at boarding school,

38
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,960
 so he went to hybrid boarding school in London.

39
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,520
 And he was bullied a lot at the school.

40
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,720
 And there was one particular bully that struck a deal with him,

41
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,880
 which was, "I won't beat you up, but you've got to read me

42
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,960
 and make up a new bedtime story every night as I come to bed."

43
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,640
 Yeah, that's the Arabian Nights.

44
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,240
 Oh, yes, it is the Arabian Nights, yes.

45
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,400
 It's Sharon's other try not to get executed.

46
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,200
 And every night she has to come up with a new cliffhanger.

47
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,280
 Absolutely. That can't be true.

48
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,120
 That's his telling, isn't it?

49
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,720
 Because sometimes authors come up with a cool origin story

50
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,400
 of why they love telling stories so much.

51
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,760
 Yeah, this was either...

52
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,800
 I got that from either the Acroyd or the...

53
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,240
 There's two big biographies that we've written about recently.

54
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,160
 But it wouldn't be...

55
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,480
 It's probably from him rather than from the bully.

56
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,320
 Oh, totally.

57
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,360
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, we got the bullies telling later on.

58
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,880
 No, it's in the autobiography of the bully.

59
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,000
 Wouldn't it be amazing if the bully then became a writer

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,720
 and used and retained all the stories

61
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,520
 that this incredible storyteller told him

62
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,520
 and had this whole career that Wilkie just had to watch

63
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,800
 and not say anything about?

64
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,920
 I mean, made up on the spot by a 13-year-old.

65
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,680
 Maybe if they're amazing stars, I don't know.

66
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,080
 It could be.

67
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,680
 Do we know why he was bullied?

68
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,680
 Because it might...

69
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,280
 He was an unusual-looking child, I think, as well.

70
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,200
 I don't know if that was it,

71
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,800
 but he had a very prominent bulge on the side of his head

72
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,960
 due to forceps from his birth.

73
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,080
 Yeah, because he still had a big forehead in adulthood,

74
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,000
 which, actually, you can see if you look at his portrait.

75
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,480
 A lot of the portraits you'll see,

76
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,720
 he's kind of looking so that the bulge is hidden a little bit,

77
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,680
 but, yeah, you can see in some of them, for sure.

78
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,160
 Like, he's looking at the wrong camera

79
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,720
 if two people are taking a photo, so, right.

80
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,680
 That's like the only portrait of Henry V

81
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,000
 is in profile, because he had a huge arrow wound at a battle

82
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 when he was about 15.

83
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,880
 Arrow's sticking out of your hand.

84
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,880
 That's amazing.

85
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,080
 Like, he used to hang his towel on it, didn't he?

86
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,520
 That's from the David Mitchell book.

87
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,520
 Is it really?

88
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,720
 And it was clearly quite disfigured on that side of his face.

89
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,680
 Actually, by coincidence, William Gladstone

90
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,400
 had one of his fingers missing on one of his hand,

91
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,560
 but whenever anyone did a painting of him,

92
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,920
 they always drew in the finger.

93
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,920
 Really?

94
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,120
 He had a full finger missing?

95
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,200
 Yeah, yeah, it was in a shooting accident or something.

96
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,200
 Wow.

97
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,640
 So it was played on screen by people with four fingers?

98
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,640
 Five fingers.

99
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,640
 Well, it's a finger or thumb.

100
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,000
 I think we have had this chat recently.

101
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 Oh, really?

102
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 Big question.

103
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,600
 Have you ever heard of Sputnik Fest?

104
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,600
 No.

105
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,480
 Sputnik Fest, it takes place in Manitowoc.

106
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,440
 I'm pronouncing that probably incorrectly.

107
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,440
 Sounds right.

108
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,440
 Wisconsin.

109
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,440
 It's in Wisconsin in America.

110
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,440
 Yeah.

111
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,440
 Oh, you pronounced it completely wrong.

112
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,840
 So Manitowoc, Wisconsin, apologies for pronunciation.

113
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,880
 But it basically, when Sputnik 4 went up

114
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,400
 and came back into Earth, huge bits of it broke up

115
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,040
 in the atmosphere, and 21 pounds of it landed in the street

116
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,480
 in this small town in Wisconsin.

117
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,560
 And there's a plaque that commemorates the spot where it's found

118
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,920
 or close to the spot where it's found that you can read.

119
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,240
 And every year, ever since then, which is 1962,

120
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,240
 Sputnik Fest has happened.

121
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,240
 It still happened this year.

122
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,560
 And you basically just go along and listen to bands.

123
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,120
 I've read the actual description of the play out of the day.

124
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,120
 Not much happens.

125
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,120
 There's a little walk.

126
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,120
 There's a race.

127
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,120
 A few people dress up as aliens.

128
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,120
 That's basically it.

129
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,160
 You have a photo up with the Sputnik Fest police.

130
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,120
 Sounds like a village fate.

131
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,120
 Exactly that.

132
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,400
 But it happens every year.

133
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,760
 So they don't recreate it at all.

134
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,760
 That's what I would do.

135
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,160
 We're dropping 21 pounds randomly from the sky.

136
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,680
 Sputnik 4 contained Ivan Ivanovich.

137
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,680
 That's right.

138
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,680
 My favorite astronaut.

139
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,160
 John Johnson, as you would say.

140
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,160
 Oh, wow.

141
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,160
 It wasn't him that landed on the streets of Wisconsin, is it?

142
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,160
 No.

143
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,160
 No, no.

144
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,160
 He was a mannequin.

145
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,160
 Oh.

146
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,160
 Kind of.

147
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,280
 There was a few animals in there.

148
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,520
 There was a guinea pig, and I think there was a dog called Chonushka.

149
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,960
 But there was this mannequin called Ivan the Cosmonaut, Ivan Ivanovich.

150
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,320
 And they tried to make him as realistic as possible.

151
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,440
 I'm not quite sure why they did make him look realistic, but they did.

152
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,180
 They put, like, eyebrows on him, maybe to see if it would singe your eyebrows or something.

153
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:35,080
 But they put him in a cosmonaut suit, and they put a sign around him saying "maquette,"

154
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,840
 which means "dummy," so that if he landed in the middle of nowhere and there was this

155
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,000
 ball and you opened it up and there was this weird-looking mannequin, you wouldn't think

156
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 it was an alien.

157
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,280
 That's what an alien might put on itself.

158
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:54,840
 But someone did, didn't they, because it landed in a field somewhere and a farmer went up

159
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,080
 and opened it and discovered, thinking it was a real astronaut, thought, "Oh my God,

160
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,840
 we've got to save him," and discovered it was a dummy and punched Ivan Ivanovich in

161
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,840
 the face.

162
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,840
 What?

163
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,840
 What?

164
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,840
 When he found out he was a dummy?

165
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,840
 In anger.

166
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,840
 That's my memory of that story.

167
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,840
 That's a futile thing to do.

168
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:15,320
 I've seen some of the Sputniks in museums in Moscow, and I think they do have on the

169
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:21,160
 outside of it, this is a government thing, phone this number if you find it.

170
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,680
 Does it say in Russian though?

171
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,080
 In Russian, yeah, just so that you don't think it's an alien or something like that.

172
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:32,400
 But again, if I was in the States or somewhere else, I would not be able to read it for one

173
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,400
 thing.

174
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,400
 That's true.

175
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,680
 What's crazy though, Ivan Ivanovich, just the animals that you're mentioning, they were

176
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,040
 in his body, it's not as if they were just in Sputnik with him.

177
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:46,720
 So what you would think is like the aliens were like that guy from Teenage Mutant Ninja

178
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,720
 Turtles.

179
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,720
 Yeah, Krang.

180
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,720
 Yeah, yeah.

181
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,440
 Or is it like the equivalent of three raccoons in a trench coat trying to get into a film?

182
00:06:53,440 --> 00:07:00,520
 I'm like, but the aliens are trying to sneak into Earth like part of the bouncers, effectively.

183
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,840
 I haven't seen a photo, but the description of it is that there were just compartments

184
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,840
 all over him.

185
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,920
 You'd have mice and say, like his leg, you would have guinea pigs in his arm, you would

186
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:13,920
 have, and then there were things like human blood samples in him and yeast and bacteria,

187
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,920
 and there was just lots of rogues.

188
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,280
 So he was just a weird shaped bag, basically.

189
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,400
 I think he was mad human like.

190
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,400
 What are we?

191
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,080
 Apart from weird shaped bags.

192
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,040
 God, that's a real, it's so nice having a make you think moment every week.

193
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,240
 That's lovely we've introduced, Anna, in your absence.

194
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,480
 We covered the Westman Islands, I think on the series of QI, that's about to go out,

195
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,240
 all our series, and basically the other thing about the Westman Islands is they have nights

196
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:43,040
 with the puffins or sort of month of the puffins as it sort of is, and this is where the people

197
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:47,760
 of the Westman Islands at night get together and scoop up puffins and bags and toss them

198
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,760
 over cliffs.

199
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,760
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

200
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,760
 This is a nice thing.

201
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,760
 But in a good way.

202
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,720
 I've heard, haven't I?

203
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,400
 So if you toss a puffin off a cliff, it's a bird that can fly.

204
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,400
 Does the bag hinder it at all?

205
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,400
 Yeah.

206
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,400
 It feels like that.

207
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,280
 Oh my God, it would be so bad if I was instructing the kids here because you do have to take

208
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,280
 it out of the bag before you drop it.

209
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,080
 Just blow into a dead bird and chop it back to the bottom of the cliff.

210
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,080
 Calling up the parents.

211
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,200
 Yeah, I've missed the crucial step in our excursion.

212
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:23,160
 No, this is because baby puffins, when they go to sea, when they leave their parents in

213
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:29,000
 the car to sea, pufflings, yes, they follow the moon and that, you know, that guy's, they

214
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,140
 follow the light of the moon and they make it to the ocean and then they're free in the

215
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,800
 sea to live their adult lives.

216
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:38,640
 In the Westman Islands, there's a city and the lights of the city confuse the pufflings

217
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,240
 and so they've started going towards the city and so you get these pufflings just wandering

218
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,640
 around the streets, really confused, but like, this isn't what Mum said the ocean was like.

219
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,560
 And they're stuck in the harbour and stuff and it's really nice though if people get

220
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:56,880
 together and they collect, you can come away from a night of puffin collecting with six

221
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,040
 or seven pufflings in your bag and then you go up to this point at the top of the cliff

222
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:07,140
 and you just take them out and shake the bag out really hard.

223
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:11,580
 Don't get home and find your tube upside down, there's one left in there.

224
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,580
 That's amazing.

225
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,580
 Wow.

226
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,580
 And they fly free.

227
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,580
 That's so good.

228
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:19,880
 Can I, this dynasty, Joeson, still going?

229
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,880
 Is it?

230
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,880
 Very exciting, yeah.

231
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,020
 Not still ruling, still going?

232
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,740
 Not still ruling, but still, still a little kicking about.

233
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,740
 So how did this amazing report about a guy called Yi Sok, I think that's how you pronounce

234
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:35,160
 it, he was born in 1944 and this was in 2006 it was written.

235
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,360
 And he was the grandson of the second last emperor and the nephew of the final emperor.

236
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,000
 And he was technically, you know, non-ruling emperor.

237
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,460
 I think he's like one of two people who are claiming to be.

238
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:52,680
 And he had had a rotten time and he had been a prince and then he had to be the singing

239
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,080
 prince on US military bases, just singing songs and doing lots of weddings and things

240
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,080
 like that.

241
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,160
 Then he became an illegal alien in the USA for a bit.

242
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,840
 We're not like, we're not in the U.F.O.

243
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,840
 No.

244
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:08,080
 And then he worked as a swimming pool cleaner, he ran Eddie's liquor store in Beverly Hills,

245
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,020
 he moved back to Korea after a bit, had to squat in his old palace.

246
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:17,300
 That was an incredible story that he basically thought I've got nowhere to live, but I technically

247
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,300
 should be the king.

248
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:22,260
 So I'm going to go to one of the palaces and live there and then the security guards came

249
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,980
 and he was like, oh, this is my palace.

250
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:28,220
 I kicked him out and it was all so damp, he was getting a bit, it was really rough.

251
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:32,600
 By 2003, he was mostly living in bath houses, you know, just going from bath house to bath

252
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
 house.

253
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,600
 Yeah.

254
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,600
 But is it bath house, you mean like thorners?

255
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,600
 Pretty much.

256
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,100
 I mean, there's a place you can go, you can hang out for a whole day there if you like.

257
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,600
 Like an unsen, I guess, in Japan, it would be like that.

258
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,600
 Exactly like that.

259
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,600
 Yeah, yeah.

260
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,600
 And then the nice news is that in 2004, the city of Chongju, they built him a house, they

261
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,440
 fixed his teeth, they got him, you know, they just got him back on his feet.

262
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,840
 And he has now passed over to a distant relative of his who lives in America, who's a tech

263
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,840
 bro.

264
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,460
 What did he pass over to?

265
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:05,100
 He's handed over, he's nominated his distant relative, who's a guy called Andrew, not me,

266
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:11,900
 he's a kind of tech bro and he's in his late 30s and they had a ceremony of the handing

267
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,180
 over of the sword in a restaurant in Beverly Hills.

268
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,020
 It's incredibly weird, but it's yeah.

269
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:20,060
 It doesn't sound that bad, like if you look at it in a different context, yes, he's not

270
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:24,900
 king, but you know, he's had a career as a singer, he got international travel.

271
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,900
 Yeah, you're right.

272
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,720
 I don't think that sounds as, the squatting bit sounds like that.

273
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,960
 I think international travel, when you have to live illegally and you have to be homeless

274
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,840
 and you have to like, I think he's had some really rough bells in his life.

275
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,160
 I'm thinking the military bit just sounded fine.

276
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,160
 He was singing.

277
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,160
 Yeah.

278
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,160
 And working as a...

279
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,160
 It's not like he was a bear dancing being poked.

280
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,400
 He was, he was, he was an entertainer.

281
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:46,760
 Your standard of what makes a good or bad life is very different.

282
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:53,680
 I would down, I think it's like we expect Royals to, you know, be much weaker and less capable

283
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,460
 of coping with for instance, working in an ice cream shop or something.

284
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,980
 This is two emperors ago that he's no longer in power.

285
00:11:58,980 --> 00:11:59,980
 Okay.

286
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:00,980
 He's just a...

287
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,660
 You live in David Lloyd Jim's for a bit and see how you like it.

288
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,660
 Just saying.

289
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,660
 Exactly.

290
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,660
 Yeah.

291
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,660
 David Lloyd Jim's.

292
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,660
 Is that?

293
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,660
 Does a gym chain tell David Lloyd?

294
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,660
 No, he was the prop hipster in the early 20th century.

295
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,020
 The famous Welsh gym chain.

296
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,020
 Yeah.

297
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,020
 What's it called that gym chain?

298
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,020
 I think it's...

299
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,020
 David Lloyd's gym, I think.

300
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,020
 You'd normally say it.

301
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,020
 It's just...

302
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,020
 What?

303
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,020
 That's what I said.

304
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,020
 It's a gym.

305
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,020
 And just...

306
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,520
 It sounded like someone called David with a dog barrel turning.

307
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,520
 Yeah, you're right.

308
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,520
 You're right.

309
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,520
 It's house you've been invited to.

310
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,520
 Okay.

311
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,520
 Let's just point it out.

312
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,520
 Welcome back Anna.

313
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,520
 Yeah, yeah, welcome back.

314
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:42,880
 The thing about their food in Korea is quite interesting because they, Koreans had a reputation

315
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:49,240
 for hundreds of years of being quite gluttonous, especially compared to Japanese and Chinese

316
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,240
 people.

317
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,460
 And it seems like it might have been kind of true.

318
00:12:54,460 --> 00:13:00,140
 So there was a French Catholic priest who said that a normal Korean would eat at least

319
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:06,540
 10 peaches in one go, and sometimes 30, 40 or 50 peaches.

320
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:10,780
 Some people said that they ate double or triple the amount of food that Japanese or Chinese

321
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,780
 people ate.

322
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:16,900
 But there was a porcelain expert called Zen Hankook, and they've looked at the different

323
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:22,060
 sizes of the bowls, and they reckon that the bowls have gotten bigger as time's gone on.

324
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:27,920
 And even in the last 100 years or so, the standard rice bowl size in Korea has gone

325
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:33,620
 from 680 millilitres to 290 millilitres, which is like 60% less.

326
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:36,200
 So it's so much smaller than it used to be.

327
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:41,480
 And there's a story in the annals of the Joseon military who sent spies to see how much rice

328
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,720
 the Japanese were carrying when they were invading, and they saw how much rice they

329
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:53,480
 had and thought, "Oh, well, they're only going to plant for like a two week siege."

330
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,320
 And it turned out they decided to wait out the siege, but a month later they were still

331
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,300
 battling and they were like, "How could they do that?"

332
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:03,260
 And it was because the rice bowls that the Japanese were using were so much smaller.

333
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,260
 That's really good.

334
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,700
 I think I read an account that there was a siege which was lifted, and some Korean soldiers

335
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:13,300
 found the bowls and said, "Oh my God, these poor Japanese soldiers, they've been using

336
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:17,720
 their sauce bowls to eat rice, those poor guys, they must have been absolutely starving."

337
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,720
 It was just smaller rice bowls.

338
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,560
 We have one of those baby monitors that when it runs out of battery, it just does a beep.

339
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:30,520
 But it's exactly the same beep as when people swear, and so you have it next to the TV and

340
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,560
 you're watching Bake Off, and they'll just be going, "Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."

341
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:40,380
 And I've got this nice cake which is *beep*, what did he say?

342
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:47,000
 In 1945, police in Halifax, Nova Scotia, started a campaign to stop people from beeping their

343
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,820
 car horns in morse code to signal out violent filthy language.

344
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:55,340
 You're going to do what to me?

345
00:14:55,340 --> 00:15:00,260
 Do you mean you have to be driving fast alongside the car that's hoping to hear the full message?

346
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,260
 It's so weird, isn't it?

347
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:05,120
 You could park at a distance outside your home, honk out an abusive message, and they

348
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,120
 drive off.

349
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,120
 Good point.

350
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,120
 You've got to park first.

351
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,120
 It's so weird.

352
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,000
 How many people know Morse code well enough to go, "Did he say 'fuck you'?"

353
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,640
 She wants me to go funk myself, hang on, do the third letter of the second word again.

354
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,640
 Was that a dot or a dash?

355
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,960
 I think the only people who know Morse code are people who are saying things like, "Gad

356
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,960
 zoops."

357
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,960
 So it's longer and harder.

358
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:33,340
 It's longer and harder as another abusive message you might get via honks, I'm afraid.

359
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:39,060
 There was another beep, which came before the invention of the beep, it was 1948.

360
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,380
 I found there was something in the Detroit Free Press.

361
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:46,560
 It was one of those classic examples of journalists writing the plainly about technology and saying

362
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,700
 the world's gone to the dogs.

363
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:54,420
 It was complaining about this new piece of tech, which had happened because there was

364
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:58,100
 a product being released that you could attach to your phone, which recorded all calls that

365
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,100
 were being made on it.

366
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:04,580
 It was 1948, so there was a gizmo that was going to be able to record whatever your phone

367
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,580
 calls were.

368
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:10,180
 But in order that it didn't contravene laws about wiretapping, you had to have a warning

369
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:13,740
 on your phone if someone called you to say that you were tapping their calls, and that

370
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,740
 was a beep.

371
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,340
 So your phone call, the phone would make a beep every 15 seconds.

372
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:24,980
 So if I called Dan and was like, "Dan, I've been having this affair with a dog," and then

373
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:30,340
 I had a beep after 15 seconds, if I heard that beep, I could go, "Oh, I was only joking.

374
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,340
 That wasn't a thing.

375
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,540
 Don't worry about it," you know, because you'd know you're being recorded.

376
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:38,220
 I'd love to challenge myself, to time myself, to swear every time the beep came up, just

377
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:42,620
 to censor myself in the chat.

378
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:47,020
 Can I just say one thing about Wilkie Collins is that he really loved a thing called Don

379
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,020
 Pedro Pie.

380
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,020
 What's that?

381
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:52,620
 It was a huge meat pie.

382
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,900
 And actually, he liked the idea of it.

383
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,340
 He'd never had it before, but he'd read about it.

384
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:00,660
 So he decided to make this enormous pie.

385
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:05,900
 It was made of loads of meat and loads of garlic, and apparently he and his father ate it, and

386
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:10,500
 then they were both very ill for several days with a horrible gastric attack, and garlic

387
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,500
 was never again mentioned in the house.

388
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,500
 That's amazing.

389
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,500
 Oh, yeah, it's the garlic.

390
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,260
 Clearly, you've not cooked the meat yet.

391
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,740
 Because he did the same thing with his first novel.

392
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:23,940
 He wrote about Tahiti, despite having never been there, and knowing virtually nothing about

393
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,940
 it.

394
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,380
 But then he had a huge gastric attack.

395
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,380
 Wow.

396
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,380
 Yeah, yeah.

397
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:33,420
 It was not published until like a hundred plus years after his death, but it was just

398
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,420
 all about Tahiti.

399
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:38,060
 One of those, kind of, maybe this is a secret work of genius moments.

400
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,060
 Oh, no, it's not.

401
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,060
 Back in the cupboard.

402
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:45,140
 Do you know, I haven't read another one of his books called Armadale, but do you guys

403
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,140
 know about this?

404
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,140
 No.

405
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,140
 All I know is...

406
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,140
 Is it Emadale's based on it, right?

407
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,140
 Yeah.

408
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:55,220
 No, it's actually how you pronounce Emadale, if you're the king.

409
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,220
 Oh, if you're a farmer.

410
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:01,700
 All I can tell you is there are five characters in it called Alan Armadale, including the

411
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,700
 two main characters.

412
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,860
 Ah, did he come up with the title?

413
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:09,580
 Is that important to the plot, or is it just...?

414
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,300
 It doesn't seem that important.

415
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,300
 No.

416
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,260
 It's just they're all kind of related, so it's grandfather, father, brother, illegitimate

417
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,260
 brother...

418
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,260
 Oh, okay, they're all related, okay.

419
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,260
 But they all feature.

420
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:21,340
 It's not like a whole name that he forgot to change, you know, later on.

421
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,460
 He sent it to the printers too early.

422
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,460
 Damn it.

423
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:31,060
 But another amazing thing about that whole thing is that apparently European hunters

424
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:37,820
 who were in Sri Lanka or India, they used to use crying human babies to lure crocodiles

425
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,620
 so they could hunt them.

426
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,620
 Really?

427
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,620
 Yeah.

428
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,620
 Wow.

429
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,620
 And apparently there's quite a few.

430
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:47,820
 These are from like the late 19th century, and there's quite a lot of newspaper articles

431
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,580
 which say that British sportsmen, as they would call them in those days, they would

432
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:57,700
 pay local parents to let them borrow their children so that they would cry and then the

433
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,060
 crocodiles would come and then they would get the crocodiles.

434
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:05,740
 And we wonder why our country has not the finest reputation around the world?

435
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,740
 I don't know.

436
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:11,780
 As a baby, if they offered a one pound per hour discount.

437
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:16,100
 I'm definitely saying anything to that.

438
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:20,220
 This fact was about Kugurani and she was kind of doing the opposite of ordering a male order

439
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,220
 bride, right?

440
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,900
 She was ordering a male order husband, you know, she was advertising and then that was

441
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,980
 a big thing in the old West because like people would go, like blokes would go out to the

442
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:33,860
 frontiers, they'd arrive, do their farming, no women, so they would send back loads of

443
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:37,460
 women on the East Coast and so they would post a lot of adverts and women on the East

444
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:42,900
 Coast would post adverts saying I'd like to meet a guy in Arizona and marry him or whatever.

445
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,380
 So anyway, I got a bit distracted and I started looking at not male order brides, but male

446
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:50,020
 order bridges.

447
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:54,220
 That feels like rather a distraction than a misprint.

448
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,860
 Yeah, it was.

449
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:57,860
 Yeah.

450
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:00,140
 Anyway, you used to be able to get bridges by male order.

451
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,140
 Really?

452
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,140
 attitude.

453
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,140
 Yeah.

454
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,140
 Why would you ever need to do that?

455
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:08,460
 Because you're on the frontier and there's no like one stop shop bridge company where

456
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,460
 you are.

457
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,500
 So you send back on the city, send as a bridge.

458
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,580
 And they send it by the mail?

459
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,580
 Yeah.

460
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,580
 Flatpak, I guess.

461
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,580
 Flatpak.

462
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,580
 Flatpak.

463
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,580
 Very much.

464
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,580
 Flatpak.

465
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,580
 How big are they?

466
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,580
 How big are the bridges?

467
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,580
 It depends on the river.

468
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,580
 Yeah.

469
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,580
 Mr. Brinnell.

470
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,580
 That's why my bridge business failed.

471
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,580
 One size fits all.

472
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:39,100
 We make every bridge big enough to go over the Amazon River.

473
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:43,820
 We guarantee it.

474
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,500
 Every bridge is four miles long.

475
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:50,220
 If you've got a tiny stream in Lincolnshire, it doesn't matter.

476
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:54,060
 All right, I need to move us on too.

477
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:57,420
 I'm just so sad we have to move on without addressing Andy's pronunciation of the word

478
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,420
 frontier.

479
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,660
 What did I say?

480
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,900
 You keep saying frontier.

481
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,900
 Frontier?

482
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,900
 Yeah.

483
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,540
 It's very endearing and we'll get letters.

484
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:14,660
 We are trying to kill some starfish at the same time as trying to save them, confusing

485
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,660
 me.

486
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:16,660
 Really?

487
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:21,180
 Yeah, conservationists are specifically trying to kill crown of thorn starfish because they

488
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,500
 eat coral.

489
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,980
 So they're really impressive.

490
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:31,820
 They crawl all over it and sort of scrape coral completely free of its living matter.

491
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:36,420
 And they've built a robot to track it down.

492
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:40,540
 I think they called it a cop spot and they trained it by machine learning to look at

493
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:46,860
 lots and lots of photos and spot which one is a crown of thorn starfish.

494
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,340
 And then they put it underwater and it tracks them down.

495
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:57,420
 If you're a starfish and your species has been around for 450 million years and then

496
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:03,620
 suddenly a robot comes along and you don't even have the concept of robots but they come

497
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:10,460
 down and they just start annihilating all of your people to like 99% of being killed

498
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,460
 by these.

499
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,940
 It must be absolutely terrifying.

500
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:13,940
 Not by the robot.

501
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,940
 I don't think it's fun.

502
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,580
 Killing 99% of these.

503
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:19,100
 Yeah, 99% is the success rate.

504
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,100
 Oh, wow.

505
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,100
 Yeah.

506
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,100
 Oh, well let's build some more.

507
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:27,220
 So like in the movie you would have one crown of thorns starfish who survived the one in

508
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,220
 a hundred.

509
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,360
 It would be like finding Nemo.

510
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:34,540
 The John Connor starfish which has to lead the resistance.

511
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:39,220
 And they've been killed so confusingly for them by cow bile as well and they don't know

512
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:43,500
 what a cow is but there's bizarrely because they built this robot and they learnt how

513
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:47,500
 to identify what they are but then scientists realised we don't actually know how to kill

514
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:51,980
 them without injecting them with something that kills everything else as well.

515
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:56,780
 So and then they just did some experiments and realised that the bile that is you find

516
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:02,460
 in cows is harmless to fish but not to crown of thorns starfish and so they go and inject

517
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,460
 them with that.

518
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,460
 Wow.

519
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:09,540
 You know these crown of thorns starfish as well, they're the animals that notice the

520
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:13,060
 world going by the slowest of all animals.

521
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,540
 Oh yeah.

522
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:21,020
 So you know that thing of like if a dog watched an old TV then it would just seem like flickering

523
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,020
 images to them.

524
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:27,180
 It would just seem like a slideshow almost because they see the world go so quickly.

525
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:33,460
 If we were to watch a crown of thorns jellyfish movie it would be just like a slideshow where

526
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:38,740
 the slides change about two every three seconds something like that.

527
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,740
 Right.

528
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:42,740
 So that's how quickly they see the world go by.

529
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:47,180
 So if you're in one place and you move to somewhere else you know three quarters of a

530
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:51,940
 second later or two thirds of a second later they won't see anything in between they'll

531
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,740
 just see you in one place and then see you in the next place.

532
00:23:54,740 --> 00:24:00,740
 Magic shows must be so easy to do crown of thorns starfish like it must be just amazing

533
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,980
 the tips must be incredible so you get for them.

534
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:07,460
 Yeah I was reading about this study it's sort of it's about what like how you can tell light

535
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:11,460
 flickers or how like how many flickers you can detect before it looks like a glowing blur

536
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,460
 to you.

537
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:17,160
 So humans can detect I didn't know we can do this 65 flickers of light a second distinct

538
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:21,020
 ones before it looks like a glow which is amazing.

539
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:26,740
 The fastest a dragonflies can do 300 a second every second they can kind of tell oh that's

540
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,740
 flickering on and off.

541
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,740
 Right.

542
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:29,740
 Isn't that amazing?

543
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,740
 Yeah.

544
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:34,420
 Do they move to the speed that they can see then or will they be like if they're moving

545
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:39,660
 one of their one of their arms will it suddenly be in a new place that they were like hang

546
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:42,540
 on that was that was over there a second ago.

547
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,540
 Constantly surprised.

548
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,540
 Yeah.

549
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:50,120
 And if you picked up one and moved their arm really quickly they would be they'd be like

550
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:54,200
 wait a minute where's my arm gone although they'd be able to feel it they would you know.

551
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:59,280
 Yeah but strobe lighting must be you know if you just turn the light on every five minutes

552
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:05,860
 that must be strobe lighting for them you'd have to have epileptic warnings and everything.

553
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:12,480
 You remember just on art conservation and stuff like that you remember the monkey Christ

554
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,480
 or potato Jesus.

555
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,480
 Oh yeah.

556
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,480
 Do you remember that?

557
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,480
 Which is it the monkey.

558
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,480
 So this was Jesus.

559
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,140
 It was the same thing.

560
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,180
 It was given both as a nickname.

561
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,180
 This is in 2012.

562
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:26,820
 You'll all remember it from the Internet I'm sure it was a woman called Cecilia Jimenez.

563
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:32,220
 She was 81 years old and she'd taken a very old painting of Jesus and decided to restore

564
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:35,780
 it and it just looked like a monkey slash potato.

565
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,780
 Exactly.

566
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:40,300
 But the interesting thing is there's two interesting things.

567
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:45,800
 Number one when it hit the news she was only halfway through restoring it and she had to

568
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:50,840
 go away and leave the town for a while and she'd gone away and then this is just absolutely

569
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,840
 hit the news.

570
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,120
 She's like I haven't finished I haven't finished.

571
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,120
 So that's one thing.

572
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,120
 Okay.

573
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:00,160
 And the second thing is because it became so famous it quadrupled the number of tourists

574
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:04,840
 who visited the town and so it got brought a whole load of money into the town.

575
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:09,120
 So actually it was kind of a good thing for the you know for the cathedral and for the

576
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,120
 people.

577
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:13,300
 So it changed everything for them like it changed everything for them it changed everything

578
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,300
 for her.

579
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:18,500
 So they have all this merchandise that gets sold now 51% of the funds that they raised

580
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:22,180
 from selling merchandise off the back of it went to the setting up of a care home and

581
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:25,700
 it looks after all the people who need care in the in the town.

582
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:30,180
 And then the other 49% went specifically to her and she has two adult children who need

583
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:33,740
 to be looked after and she can now that's why she was working.

584
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:37,300
 That's why she was in her 80s looking after stuff she was trying to look after them.

585
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,820
 It's changed her entire life.

586
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:41,760
 But did it I have a question did it when she finished the job?

587
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,760
 Did she ever get to finish?

588
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,120
 No she never finished because she'd really like she'd really banjaxed it.

589
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:50,080
 I don't see how that can be phase one and phase two is how it looks like it did before

590
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,080
 she started.

591
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,160
 I said it wasn't possible.

592
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,160
 You're absolutely right.

593
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:57,120
 I think the final even if she'd have been like to do it for another 20 years until she

594
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,120
 was 101.

595
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,120
 Yeah.

596
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,120
 It probably will still have been not very good.

597
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,840
 It's like you've got scrambled eggs and I just I just need to do a little bit more

598
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:12,500
 work and I'll have an egg again and like that's okay.

599
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,500
 That's it.

600
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,860
 That is all of our outtakes.

601
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,820
