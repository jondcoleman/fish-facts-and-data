00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,200
 "Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast

2
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,320
 coming to you from the QI offices in Hobern."

3
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,660
 This episode's Annotishinsky's last episode for a while, as she heads off onto maternity

4
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:30,300
 leave. We'll be seeing her in nine months, but we've got one more episode. Once again,

5
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,640
 we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven

6
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,880
 days, and in a particular order, here we go. Starting with fact number one, and that

7
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:45,660
 is my fact. My fact this week is that Harriet Beatrice Stowe, author of Uncle Tom's Cabin,

8
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:53,420
 wrote the novel for the first time twice. This is a story I found it on a website

9
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:59,060
 that is Uncle Tom's Cabin, an American culture. It's a dedicated page to all historical articles

10
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:04,940
 about Harriet Beatrice Stowe. In it, it points out that near the end of her life, she was suffering

11
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:09,540
 from a disease of the brain. She might have dementia, she might have Alzheimer's, we're

12
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:15,900
 not quite sure. But in that period, she found herself rewriting as if it were a new story

13
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,620
 Uncle Tom's Cabin, and telling everyone, "I've got this amazing book that I'm writing.

14
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:23,620
 I think it's going to be big." Apparently, when people were looking at the writing, it

15
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:28,480
 was almost word for word what the original book was. The Washington Post said, "If the

16
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:33,460
 manuscript could be compared with the corresponding portions of the original copy, it is not likely

17
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,220
 that much difference of appearance would be discovered."

18
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:40,660
 So it wasn't a big prose-lavery tract suddenly that she found herself producing in the

19
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,660
 '80s.

20
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:45,420
 We should explain those two things, Harriet Beatrice Stowe, and Uncle Tom's Cabin, I guess.

21
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:51,860
 It's a property book, isn't it? How to make a desirable residence on a budget.

22
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,900
 This is a game-changing book in America.

23
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:59,060
 Harriet Beatrice Stowe, she was very much against the world of slavery in America, came from

24
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:05,420
 a family that was very, very much fighting that cause. So she wrote a series of stories

25
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:11,900
 that were published, like how Dickens used to do it. It's serialized in a magazine.

26
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,300
 When the book came out, it just really hit a note. It suddenly made sense to a lot of

27
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,760
 white America about what was going on. There was this new thing that was put in place in

28
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,980
 this period whereby if you were caught housing a runaway slave, you were now going to jail,

29
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:29,180
 or you were going to be fined, which meant that no one was looking after these people. And

30
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:33,740
 then there was very much parallels of what's going on right now in America. People were

31
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:38,860
 being taken away. Black Americans would know due process, and they were being jailed, and

32
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:42,380
 it was a hectic time. So this book was saying this is not acceptable.

33
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,940
 It arguably led to the civil war. I think, right?

34
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:49,700
 Yeah, Lincoln jokes about that, didn't they? The little woman who started the civil war.

35
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:54,980
 I love that. So they met. Harriet Beatrice Stowe, Met Lincoln, and I think about 1862, and

36
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,300
 he supposedly said that to her on the little woman who wrote the book that started this

37
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:03,180
 great war. I think it might be a later. Her family said it would have been said later.

38
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,700
 They were allowed to do that. They achieved a lot of the family.

39
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,920
 But for sure, it did change a lot of minds in America. It was so, sorry to go into book

40
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:16,440
 sales mode, but it was so successful. I think it sold 300,000 copies in the USA in its first

41
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,960
 year. And it I think might have been the biggest seller of any book in that century, the

42
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,920
 19th century, barring the Bible. I think it was. It was big. The time said that the amount

43
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,600
 of royalties that she got is the largest sum of money ever received by any author, either

44
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:35,160
 American or European, from the sales of a single work in such an amount of time.

45
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,040
 Wow. Do you know what the second best selling book of the 1850s was?

46
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:44,480
 Oh, good question. 1850s. Is this guessable? Dickens? No, no, it's not guessable. I'd be astonished

47
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,840
 if you don't have it. Right. It hasn't had the same kind of longevity as Uncle Tom's

48
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,120
 cabin. So Uncle Tom's cabin was the top. And then the second was called Ten Nights in

49
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,880
 a Bar, and what I saw there. Absolutely. That sounds awesome. It does sound like more fun

50
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:03,320
 reading. Unless it's like, because I've been to bars regularly, and actually you tend

51
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,840
 to see the same things again and again. It's like, oh, that group of people watching

52
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,680
 the horse racing. Yeah, same like crying in the corner. There's Andy telling the same

53
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,640
 anecdote over and over again. I empathise with Harriet and be just, I don't mean to trivialise

54
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,960
 whatever condition she had, but like I frequently will get to the end of an anecdote and people

55
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:22,640
 around me are going, yeah, yes, Andy, yes, that was, yeah, that was, that was an anecdote. I told

56
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:27,840
 you. Half an hour ago. In that article, by the way, because I found it in the newspaper

57
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,360
 archives, they also said that she had confusedly given permission to two publishers to write

58
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,200
 her official biography thinking that they were the same person. And there's a big sort of financial

59
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:44,280
 problem between those two companies. I can really imagine doing that now. Actually, like

60
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,180
 you see that same, not very good with family. You've got face blindness. You've probably promised

61
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:53,280
 your biography to ten of them. Yeah, I'm quite disappointed. It hasn't been written yet.

62
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,440
 What's really interesting is the reaction to the book. Because obviously, as we've also had

63
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,280
 a huge reaction, there was a real life inspiration, a man called Josiah Henson, who was himself

64
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,720
 enslaved and in real life escaped to Canada and founded a settlement and a school for former

65
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:13,520
 slaves. But what's amazing is after the book came out and had this huge social reaction

66
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:19,400
 and effect, there was a ferocious pro-slavery pushback even in the novel sphere. So at least

67
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:25,760
 15 novels were published in response, very much in favor of slavery, saying slaves in the

68
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:30,000
 south are better off and then free men and women in the north. So one of them was called

69
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,760
 Uncle Robin in his cabin in Virginia and Tom, without one, in Boston. Not a good title.

70
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:42,200
 Like we can all agree. A shit title for a book. And the argument inside, obviously. Yeah.

71
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:47,160
 Yeah, and you were saying that it was kind of in magazines to start off with, it was serialized.

72
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,960
 They also had pro-slavery magazines. Right. Basically doing the opposite. So if you went

73
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,440
 to WHO Smiths in mid-19th century America, on the shelves, you would have half of them

74
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,640
 would be pro-slavery magazines and half would be anti-slavery magazines. Well, it was like

75
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:06,440
 the BBC today. You've got to have balance, haven't you? If you get on then. Get on the

76
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,460
 anti-fascist, you've got to get on the fascist. But she wrote another book off the back of Uncle

77
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:14,860
 Tom's cabin, the key to Uncle Tom's cabin, which was basically a bibliography describing

78
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:19,680
 everything that had gone into Uncle Tom's cabin. She named Josiah Henson as the inspiration

79
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,880
 for the Uncle Tom character. Because they were like, oh, you just made it up. You'd never

80
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,240
 even been here. You don't know any enslaved people. You just like, and she needed to prove

81
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,660
 that it wasn't like that. Yeah. But good. I mean, great. When the publisher says, what's

82
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:36,520
 next? Harriet? Well, it's more Uncle Tom's cabin in a good way. That's a good idea. Like,

83
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,580
 you know, like the QI fat books that we used to write. We could write another one saying,

84
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:45,080
 no, no, this is true. Well, that's the thing. Well, then I'm keeping our sources. Because

85
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,960
 I have a panic attack every time James sent me an email going, and what is your source

86
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,680
 for this? Like, I don't know. I do need it immediately. Which James, you want to publish

87
00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:01,400
 a book of just pure URLs. It's the key to QI. I got another one of her writings. Lady Byron

88
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:08,960
 vindicated. Oh, yeah. This is where she gets spicy. Yeah. She was defending Byron's widow

89
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:15,420
 by revealing that Byron had an affair with his own sister half sister. Okay. Not that that

90
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:26,980
 changes matters. Sorry. Half sister. Oh, well, that's not even a fact then. Is that not interesting?

91
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:32,660
 No, it was incredibly. This was a second most controversial book. I'd say when she published

92
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:37,940
 this piece in the Atlantic, American magazine still going today, it lost them 15,000 subscribers

93
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:41,620
 who said, I don't mind reading about various other things, but I draw the line at Law Byron

94
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:45,740
 having an affair with his half sister. I think it was a third of a subscriber's cloud. I mean,

95
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:49,740
 that's a big hit, isn't it? That's one article you feel so. You know what? She wrote another

96
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:56,100
 book in 1873 called Women in Sacred History, where she said that one of the apostles was

97
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:01,460
 a woman, Lydia. So she was just an edgelard. Yeah. It's just keeping coming. That's stunning.

98
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:05,260
 Yeah. And the clue is in the name, isn't it? Lydia the Apostle? Oh, there's no one else

99
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:13,500
 in that. Did you say which of the apostles was? Yeah, Lydia. No, but which was that Thomas?

100
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:18,180
 No, I think like the Bible, just there are actually 13 apostles, but the Bible never mentioned

101
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,540
 it. See, it must have been one of the judices. Well, there were two judices. That's right.

102
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:26,700
 Two James's. One of them must have been the Lydia. I reckon. You just like panicked and

103
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,180
 gave the name of the person she was looking at. That's what you do, isn't it? It's a Mrs.

104
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:35,860
 outfire moment. Just quickly on the on the Byron thing, because she was great mates with Lady Byron,

105
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:41,180
 because after Uncle Tom's cabin, she met everyone. I mean, she was friends with so many

106
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:46,660
 eminent people. George Elliott, wouldn't she? Great mates. But this wrecked her reputation,

107
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:50,460
 the Byron book. There was so much criticism. She had to hire a secretary to deal with the

108
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:55,380
 correspondence and hire a lawyer. And the person who stood up for her, I'm afraid enemy

109
00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:00,820
 of the podcast, Mark Twain, he stood up for her and he was really good about it. And I just

110
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,540
 think that's inviscated a bit. They were mates. They were mates. They were mates, but have

111
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:07,300
 you seen what he was running about her in their later life? Because they were neighbours,

112
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,460
 not just mates. Oh, what did he say about her? I mean, it's not very nice.

113
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:16,140
 She trimmed the head wrong. Yeah. That's not getting the garden. Dogwood shit in his garden.

114
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:20,860
 No, he said her mind had decayed and she was a pathetic figure. But I think he means

115
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:27,740
 pathetic, not as in we mean pathetic. Yeah, that's not criticism. I read that wrong then.

116
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,300
 Yeah, that no pathetic back then would have meant someone that you feel really sorry for

117
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,620
 because she's got really unwell. And then he wrote, people in the area where they both

118
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:39,900
 of them lived would leave their doors open and then Harriet Beecher Stowe would go into

119
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:49,020
 their houses and then push them over and go, "Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop,

120
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:52,060
 whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop. She wrote that as well."

121
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:56,260
 But then also that she would play her piano and you'd hear her singing melancholic songs to

122
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:00,420
 great effect. Right. Yeah, no, they were mates. They were mates. Okay, cool. Can we finally

123
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:04,540
 talk about her husband? Because we talk about these women all the time on this podcast,

124
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:09,500
 don't we? Agreed. She wrote a lot of stuff, but he did write a pamphlet.

125
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:16,020
 And the pamphlet that he wrote described the frequent visitations from tiny fairies that

126
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:21,980
 danced on his windowsill. Really? Yeah. And I bet he talked about his pamphlet much more

127
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:27,980
 than she talked about her, like 50 seminal books and crucial impact on 19th century literature.

128
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:32,100
 Well, I can tell you that his fairies that he saw were ruled over by King and Queen, who

129
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:37,060
 were slightly larger than the other fairies, but they had a sinister and selfish expression

130
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:40,860
 on their faces that stopped him from trusting them. Even though they always smiled, there

131
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,380
 is something sinister about them, so he didn't trust these fairies. Sorry, is this a vision

132
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:48,540
 he had, and then he wrote into a pamphlet? Or is this a metaphor for something? It's a metaphor.

133
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:52,740
 Yeah, it's what he thought, yeah. That's kind of sad, because I know he was very encouraging

134
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,700
 of her, this very career, and she probably felt like she should do the same for him, but...

135
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,500
 I just need a quick quote for the cover, darling, if that's all right. Just like something

136
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:05,100
 about the fairies and how they're really well described or something. Yeah, yeah, well,

137
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,500
 yeah. Sorry, I've got to go meet Queen Victoria now.

138
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:19,740
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy. My fact is, some tortoises have hinges.

139
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:26,380
 So these are imaginatively named animals called hingeback tortoises, and there are loads of species,

140
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:31,100
 and they have a hinge at the back. It's like a hatchback car. Yeah. And it means their back can

141
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:36,380
 just go boom, and close up when they're trying to retreat into their shell. There are loads of

142
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,580
 different species. There's the forest, there's bells, there's the homes, there's the western.

143
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:44,540
 I saw some of them two weeks ago, which is why I submitted this fact, yeah. That's so cool.

144
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:49,580
 Could you see the hinge? I couldn't get my arm quite far off into the enclosure to...

145
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:57,020
 It was a shame, but I read all about them. This was in a little rainforest experience near

146
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:03,500
 Reading. It's the home of rainforest experiences. It's a fantastic place, like it's amazing,

147
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,780
 the stuff they had there. Anyway, and they have these. Sorry, when you say retreat into their shell,

148
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,820
 I would have thought that that would be on the front, then you'd put their head, retract

149
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,860
 their heads in, and then they'd drop a hinge down. But what they're retreating their bottom into

150
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:16,380
 their shell, and then they're... I think they're legs on their legs and their tail, basically.

151
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:20,460
 Their legs and their tail just go back in. I don't think any species has yet evolved a front hinge,

152
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:24,380
 but that's something evolution is probably working on. So if the predates are comes from the front,

153
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:28,620
 they're buggered. Well, I don't know. I mean, because you're always going to be running away from

154
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:33,420
 a predator, aren't you? So it does make sense that you're closing the back. Yeah. They can retreat

155
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,940
 a fair bit inside. I think they can pull, obviously, they can pull their heads in. I just don't know

156
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:41,100
 how far in. There are some which have a really awkward thing where they put their head in and to the

157
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:46,620
 side, and they just sort of scooch in there like that. I'm doing it now for the benefit of listeners.

158
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,900
 You've done a lot of physical stuff so far in this fact for the benefit of listeners,

159
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:55,100
 that they're enjoying. That's more to come. I believe also the hinge helps them to open their shell

160
00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:01,020
 a bit further and lay their eggs. And they have eggs that are bigger than average for a turtle,

161
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:06,700
 which means that the hinge is useful. Brilliant. They're mutant turtles. They do live into their

162
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,620
 teens, I believe. Yeah. And we should say just because you've chucked in the word turtle now,

163
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,820
 and I didn't look into them, but they are tortoises, right? Yeah, they are. Although they're

164
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,860
 often used interchangeably, and we've talked about the difference. Well, tortoises are turtle,

165
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:23,020
 but a turtle's not a tortoise. Yeah. Okay, I get it. Yeah. I don't. And they also, their shell,

166
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:27,740
 is slightly different than normal shells. It's got a little channel that when it rains,

167
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:31,820
 the water goes down the channel and goes straight to their mouth. What no it doesn't.

168
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:36,140
 They've got guttering. What do you mean? Like one of those American sports hats that has a straw

169
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:40,460
 that comes right in. Exactly like that. They shouldn't be the hinge back tortoise. They should be

170
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:47,420
 the beer can. That's tartar. That's unbelievable. Yeah. That's incredible. That's incredible.

171
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:52,700
 Evolution, man. I know we say it week in, week out on this show, but it's thrown up some cracking

172
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:59,980
 stuff. It does well. Yeah. There are box turtles, and they are slightly different. I think they might

173
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:04,380
 also be a kind of tortoise, but they're definitely called the box turtle, and they have a hinge on

174
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:10,060
 their belly, which helps them to close the front and back half up like a box when they flex it.

175
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:15,340
 So they become, like all your innards are going to drop out every time you open it. I believe it goes

176
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:22,700
 the opposite way to that. Yes. Right. I think it's closing up, not opening out. I'm splitting open.

177
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:28,860
 I've got to pick that up. Yeah. I find that hard to visualise without anything. I'm not getting on

178
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:37,900
 the floor, but I'm sorry. But the eastern box turtle was going to be made the official state emblem,

179
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,980
 or one of the official state emblems of Virginia. You know, every American state has like this is the

180
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:47,260
 official state fern and the official state ice cream flavour. Yeah. Exactly. And so Virginia,

181
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:51,580
 they suggested a couple of times in different years, bills to honour the eastern box turtle.

182
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:56,060
 And I just really like this. I think this is from the Wikipedia about them. In 2009,

183
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:01,420
 delegate Frank Hargrove of Hannover asked why Virginia would make an official emblem of an animal

184
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:06,540
 that retreats into its shell when frightened and dies by the thousands crawling across roads.

185
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:10,780
 I just think that's such a mean thing. Yeah. Yeah, it's got other assets. It's not it's fault

186
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:18,540
 that we've created the car. No, exactly. On turtles being able to do entertaining things.

187
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:26,060
 In the olden days, I found this out in a study which was called tortoise rides and alligator slides.

188
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:30,380
 In zoos that had tortoises, tortoise rides were the thing. It was like the donkey ride,

189
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:34,860
 but it was a tortoise ride. I've seen a photo of Rothschild on the back of a tortoise.

190
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:38,540
 Rothschild loved riding his tortoises. Yes, but if you went to the zoo, sorry.

191
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:44,380
 You wanted to just Walter Rothschild, who was a big old collector. Is that one knows who Rothschild is?

192
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:49,020
 Or it might be that I couldn't remember his first name, so I just said his surname.

193
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:52,460
 But this is what you would do if you went to any zoo which had giant tortoises,

194
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:56,540
 then they would offer rides and it would either be just lots of children would climb on top.

195
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,980
 Or they had little tortoise carriages and the tortoise would pull it.

196
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:04,220
 Okay, that is cute. I don't know why we stopped doing that.

197
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:07,100
 No, let's bring it back.

198
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,740
 What's an alligator slide, sorry.

199
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:15,260
 The alligator slide. No, it was said in this study that this was the most outrageous thing

200
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:20,460
 that they made animals do, but basically it was making an alligator go up before me to high-ish ramp.

201
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:23,980
 And then sliding down a steep slide, which sounds to me incredibly fun.

202
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:27,340
 You wouldn't have to make me do that. You're not an alligator though, are you?

203
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:31,020
 I'm not an alligator. Also, alligator rides were commonly offered.

204
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:35,260
 There were lots of pictures of children. Children sitting on the backs of alligators.

205
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,940
 It's not your most loved child though.

206
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,940
 I think it would be the least favourite. Yeah, number three.

207
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:44,060
 I guess if you lock the mouth shut, you're okay if you're not in water.

208
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:47,660
 You can hold the mouth shut with no force or with elastic band, you can hold it.

209
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,460
 And that's what you'll say to child number three as you said in English.

210
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,580
 Come on, little Johnny, you're stronger than the elastic band, aren't you?

211
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,860
 What kind of pair of you? You see an elastic band over their mouth?

212
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,620
 You go, "Yeah, it's all good, man. It's all good."

213
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,180
 I can't say. In the pictures I saw in the mouth, it was hanging open.

214
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:06,620
 As it crumbled along with the child, but I'm sure that they're very well-trained.

215
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:11,180
 Just to say, the jaws of these animals like crocodiles and alligators and camons,

216
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:14,060
 they're really strong for closing, they're really weak for opening.

217
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:19,420
 No, absolutely. That's the kind of ki-fact that, in real life, I'm not sure.

218
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:23,500
 I'm willing to put my reputation on the line and my genitals.

219
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:29,420
 No, you have further alligator, a very good breakfast already, right? I think so.

220
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:32,220
 It was either today or last week that he had breakfast. I'm sure he's still full.

221
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:36,620
 Have you guys heard other unusual tortoises and turtles and things?

222
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,860
 The African pancake tortoise.

223
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:43,020
 No, this is a great one. I'm going to say flat.

224
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:48,060
 It's flat. It's got a flat shell, but the cool thing about it is not only that,

225
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:53,820
 but it's that it can flip over very quickly when it lands on its back because it's so light.

226
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,940
 It's a bit like in robot wars, there's always one that can write itself.

227
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:57,500
 Yeah.

228
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,580
 And those are always the most dangerous robots of all.

229
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,740
 But you're saying this can flip onto its back very quickly?

230
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,740
 I can say it flips off its back.

231
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,100
 It can write itself.

232
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,020
 So like the fingers with tortoises is at least in cartoons,

233
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:12,300
 they end up on their back and they can't get back onto their feet, right?

234
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,580
 I think that is real.

235
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:18,140
 I think it takes twice or three times as much energy for most of them to do that as it would to walk.

236
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:18,940
 So that's great.

237
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:22,220
 Well, the African pancake one, though, it has a very light shell which means it can run

238
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,220
 much faster than your average tortoise.

239
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,700
 But it's not got a big defense because it's got a very light shell.

240
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:31,580
 So when it's threatened, it just runs for cover and it runs under a rocky crevice

241
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:34,940
 and then breathes in like a puff of fish.

242
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,900
 And it's impossible to pull it out because it's just wedged in there.

243
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,940
 Oh, so cool.

244
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,300
 The rock becomes the shell.

245
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,260
 Yeah, wow.

246
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,780
 You've really got to find the perfect shape, rock.

247
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,420
 I can imagine running to a huge pile of rocks is staring panic.

248
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,100
 So all of them, I can't get under that one.

249
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:47,900
 That one's too big.

250
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,780
 That one's, ah, where's the rock that's made for me, but cool.

251
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,660
 That's a really good point.

252
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,860
 Do they sus out the local rocks ahead of them?

253
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,700
 I don't have data.

254
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,900
 We found the new books of tortoises with all the rock locations.

255
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,780
 Well, because they do an interesting thing whereby they'll often sleep

256
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,940
 in a bit where they know the sun is going to get to them in the morning.

257
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,500
 So this is not all species of tortoises, but a lot.

258
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,180
 They can't dissipate the part of the sun.

259
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:09,820
 Yeah, quite clever.

260
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,780
 So that's where they will sleep.

261
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,740
 So they know that when the sun hits in the morning, it warms them up and it gets them going.

262
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,980
 They only have to have been there for the previous morning.

263
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,740
 They've got good memories.

264
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,620
 Yeah, okay.

265
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,660
 It's not so, okay.

266
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:24,060
 Unless they go to a new place on holiday and they just work out which way is east and west.

267
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:24,780
 That's quite cool.

268
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:28,300
 Because I've failed to do that on holiday when parking the car, for example.

269
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,700
 You park the higher car under the shade of the one tree.

270
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,300
 And you think, oh, that'll be right for four hours.

271
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,460
 Then you come back, same getting on a train.

272
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,500
 And you sit on one side of the train and you're like, oh, this will be beautiful.

273
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,860
 And then suddenly you're in there.

274
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:39,740
 You're in an oven.

275
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,300
 You're in an oven.

276
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,060
 Well, that's because you're both warm-blooded creatures.

277
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,580
 So you don't understand the necessity.

278
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,740
 If you were a tortoise, you would have died on that train.

279
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,500
 And you would have died on that path.

280
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,900
 So it's more important.

281
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:54,860
 Well, when the ticket collects, okay, my ran and hid between some perfectly sized suitcases.

282
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,740
 The Galapagos silence tortoises.

283
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:00,780
 Very famous because of Darwin going there, finding them.

284
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:04,380
 And they were also really endangered.

285
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,300
 Partly because we ate them all.

286
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,580
 So Darwin came across them.

287
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,860
 They had delicious meat.

288
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:11,340
 Who rode them, too, didn't he?

289
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,620
 I think he did he ride them.

290
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,180
 Yeah, picture of him having a cheeky ride.

291
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,380
 Yeah, he was good.

292
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,220
 If you're the one who's discovered them.

293
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:18,700
 Yeah.

294
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:23,580
 And also, I think if you discover any species, you should be allowed to ride it.

295
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,100
 Yes, that's a good rule.

296
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,660
 I mean, incredibly fragile bats.

297
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,180
 No, I'm getting on that.

298
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,300
 Settle it up.

299
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:34,620
 I think if you discover a new species, you get a little card.

300
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,700
 And you can go to any zoo in the world.

301
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,500
 And you just pull it out and you go, "I'm allowed to ride this."

302
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:44,700
 The Lama is recovering from a serious lumbar region surgery, it doesn't matter.

303
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,380
 So yeah, they were big and delicious.

304
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,580
 And they were endangered.

305
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,420
 And actually, on the island of Espanola,

306
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,740
 there's a specific kind of giant tortoise,

307
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:57,580
 which was down to 14 in number in the 1970s.

308
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:57,980
 Wow.

309
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,300
 But now, their numbers have really recovered.

310
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,860
 And there are over 3,000 because of breeding programs.

311
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,100
 And the reason this is really important to conserve them.

312
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,380
 One of the reasons is that they're extremely important for albatrosses.

313
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:11,660
 Because they facilitate something about albatross lives.

314
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,500
 What do you think of when you think albatrosses?

315
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,820
 I think of them at sea, bad luck.

316
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,140
 - Yeah. - In Japan. - Oh, no.

317
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:17,940
 - In Japan. - In Japan.

318
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:18,780
 - In Japan. - In Japan.

319
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,620
 - Crossbow. - Yes, yeah.

320
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,300
 - And they fly for extremely long periods.

321
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,340
 - That's good. - Oh, big wingspanes.

322
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,260
 - Big, there we go.

323
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,780
 You can have your guest down, but we've got the rounds.

324
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,620
 - I think, I think.

325
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,500
 - It was a phrase in car games, a dead rubber.

326
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,460
 - Well, there's absolutely no consequence whatsoever.

327
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,580
 - I wouldn't see that on university challenge

328
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,700
 where someone buzzes in, "Bzzz."

329
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,580
 Lord Byron, that's correct.

330
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,260
 - That goes, "No, no, I can have another guest."

331
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,780
 Sorry, Jeremy, just quickly.

332
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,500
 - I think. - Yes.

333
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,860
 - That, quite often they need to crack things open.

334
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:51,660
 And there's nothing that's really hard around.

335
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,340
 So, an albatross will fly over a giant tortoise,

336
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,860
 drop the item, be it an egg or whatever.

337
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,980
 It cracks open on their tortoise shell.

338
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,580
 - Like a reverse escalus.

339
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,180
 - Yes, exactly. - Oh.

340
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,540
 - Exactly. - That is correct.

341
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,420
 That's actually how albatross has hatched their eggs

342
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:08,100
 is they dropped more bags of tortoises.

343
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:11,740
 - So escalus supposedly died when an eagle was carrying a tortoise

344
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,740
 and dropped it on his head,

345
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,020
 'cause thinking it was a rock.

346
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,660
 - Exactly, yeah, this is the opposite of that.

347
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,300
 - Is he right, Anna?

348
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,940
 - It's really more about Andy's answer

349
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,180
 that they're very big windspans.

350
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,740
 Mean that, and the fact that they're very large anyway,

351
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:27,020
 they need a long runway to take off

352
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,020
 'cause they keep running and flapping, but like this one.

353
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,940
 And they need to be very wide.

354
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,900
 And as soon as the tortoises went,

355
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,780
 what they do is they tramp up and down the mountains all day

356
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:38,020
 and they tramp down the vegetation straight lines

357
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,860
 and they make these flawless, huge runways.

358
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,500
 And without them, the albatrosses can't take off.

359
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,620
 So the albatrosses were all dying out as well.

360
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,220
 - I don't think Andy got that right.

361
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,900
 I think he just said wings and you filled in the rest.

362
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,020
 - It's a very big, and I was about to go on to say,

363
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,100
 exactly that about what they're creating.

364
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,340
 - Yeah, sorry.

365
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,220
 If you're a cuckold in Northern China.

366
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,060
 - Yeah.

367
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,140
 (laughing)

368
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,580
 - Big shout out to the cuckolds in Northern China.

369
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,380
 - I know, I know you guys are listening.

370
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,340
 You've got time on your hands, now she's gone.

371
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:11,180
 Your known as a tortoise, that term survives.

372
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,980
 It's hundreds of years old term.

373
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:13,820
 - Really?

374
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:14,660
 - Yeah.

375
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,500
 - Why is it?

376
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,060
 - Is it about being too slow and so someone's whips

377
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,060
 someone out from under your nose?

378
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,500
 - Oh, very good, but it's not right.

379
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,540
 - I think it was getting going into your shell.

380
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,380
 Something like that.

381
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,300
 - Yeah, that's it.

382
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,620
 So they're associated.

383
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,460
 - I'm not a psycho.

384
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,300
 - I think I know.

385
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:30,660
 Basically, they're, I think they're associated with,

386
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:33,700
 I'm sorry to say a D2 messing penis.

387
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:37,940
 And so it's all sort of shrinking down and going

388
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,700
 soft and you're shirking danger as well.

389
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,540
 So that's why.

390
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,020
 - Thank god he didn't act that one out.

391
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:42,980
 (laughing)

392
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,140
 - I am, Dan, I am.

393
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,660
 You just can't see under the table.

394
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,500
 - Can I say one thing about hinges?

395
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,420
 - Oh, okay, yeah.

396
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,260
 - So there's a door in this room.

397
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,100
 - Yeah.

398
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:52,940
 - Yeah.

399
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,940
 - It leads to the next room.

400
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,980
 And there are three hinges on it.

401
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,700
 What can you tell me about the spacing

402
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,900
 of the top and bottom hinges?

403
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,660
 - The, the equidistant?

404
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,500
 - Yeah, they seem, they seem--

405
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,660
 - They seem it, don't they?

406
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,500
 - Yeah, they seem the same as in the top of the bottom.

407
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,740
 - Is the bottom one actually a bit closer

408
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,380
 to the middle one compared to the top one?

409
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,220
 - Yeah, but the bottom one is further from the floor

410
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,940
 than the top one is from the top.

411
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:12,940
 - Oh!

412
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,660
 - And there's a few reasons for that.

413
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,700
 One of them is, it's an illusion.

414
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,540
 - Yeah.

415
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,620
 - So to you, it looks about the same,

416
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,820
 but actually it's not the same.

417
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,980
 And that's because of the foreshortening effects.

418
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,940
 So when things are slightly further away,

419
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,420
 distance looks different.

420
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:28,540
 And the other thing is, the top of your door,

421
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,740
 the hinge is holding more of the weight.

422
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:34,060
 So the top one needs to be closer to the top.

423
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,140
 - Close to the pivot.

424
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:35,980
 - Closer to the pivot.

425
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:36,820
 - Closer to the pivot weight.

426
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:37,660
 - Exactly, yeah.

427
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,380
 - We can all agree the middle one

428
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,740
 is not pulling its weight there, right?

429
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,580
 (laughing)

430
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,420
 - What's it he been doing?

431
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,980
 - What's middle hinge doing?

432
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,020
 - The middle one is there just because

433
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,260
 three is a good number for the size of a door.

434
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,100
 - I guess it helps with the illusion as well.

435
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,020
 - Yeah, it does.

436
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,900
 - But the middle one is usually exactly in the middle.

437
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,740
 - That's very good to know this.

438
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,540
 So if you ever climb a step ladder

439
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,700
 and suddenly look at your door and think,

440
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,220
 hang on, the hinges are all off.

441
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,100
 And then you get down and think they're not again.

442
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,220
 That's just the illusion.

443
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,700
 - It might not just be the illusion

444
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,460
 if you're doing DIY, and it might be like,

445
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,380
 and with this particular door, James.

446
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,220
 - Yeah.

447
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,420
 - The frame that's around this door

448
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,580
 is not on the bottom, but is on the top.

449
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,400
 - Oh yeah.

450
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,240
 - It's creating anything towards that illusion as well

451
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,000
 that I'm adding in the frame.

452
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,160
 - Can't hurt.

453
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,320
 (laughing)

454
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,560
 - If the frame is--

455
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,480
 - It's a little question of the night,

456
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,600
 because this is, he wants to get home.

457
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,800
 (laughing)

458
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,320
 - And all questions don't go.

459
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,160
 Bye.

460
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,740
 (upbeat music)

461
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:34,800
 - Okay, and it's time for fact number three.

462
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,280
 And that is Anna.

463
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:39,480
 - My fact this week is that after Frida Kahlo died,

464
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,160
 all her clothes and possessions spent 50 years

465
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,300
 in a bathroom.

466
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,080
 - Wow.

467
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,680
 - Functioning bathroom?

468
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,400
 - People weren't going in and out using it, no.

469
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,280
 With no number ones, no number twos.

470
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,640
 - Big bathroom, 'cause presumably she had a lot of possessions.

471
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,640
 - She did have a hell of a lot of stuff in there,

472
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,880
 so because it must have been.

473
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,600
 So just to tell you how this happened,

474
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,920
 it wasn't necessarily the plan,

475
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,280
 but Frida Kahlo died in 1954.

476
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,200
 - She was a Mexican artist.

477
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,920
 - And yes, to go back one step further,

478
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,320
 she was a Mexican artist.

479
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,640
 - Famously Mono Browd.

480
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,360
 - Famously Mono Browd, yes.

481
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,240
 - Imagine Oasis, but they're Mexican,

482
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,720
 and instead of singing songs, they paint stuff.

483
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,560
 - Yes.

484
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:24,680
 - And she did, she modeled herself on Oasis, actually.

485
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,880
 So I think you've got the picture.

486
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:30,640
 She dies 1954, her husband, Diego Rivera,

487
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,600
 shot all of her belongings in a bathroom in her house,

488
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,880
 which is called the Blue House in Mexico City.

489
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,520
 And it was a house where she'd been born,

490
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,080
 where she'd grown up, and where she and Diego Rivera lived,

491
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,360
 and where she'd died.

492
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,560
 And he said, "I want all of her possessions

493
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:48,120
 "to be locked in here until 15 years after I die."

494
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:48,960
 - 15.

495
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,120
 - 15.

496
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,960
 I know a bit of a twist coming.

497
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,920
 And we don't really know why.

498
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,360
 We think like out of sensitivity for her,

499
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,040
 things that might be revealed,

500
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,680
 and thought, you know, give it a bit of time,

501
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,280
 'cause there's all her letters and stuff.

502
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,120
 But basically, he entrusted this task

503
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,440
 to a woman called Dolores Olmedo,

504
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,160
 who was a huge fan of Diego Rivera,

505
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,680
 as all women sort of were.

506
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,280
 He was obviously a compelling man.

507
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,000
 So I think she probably fancied him

508
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,160
 and definitely adored him, didn't really like Frida.

509
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,080
 And so she just never took him out.

510
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,120
 She just locked them in the bathroom,

511
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,840
 waited, Diego Rivera died a few years later,

512
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,960
 and she just kept them in there.

513
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,200
 - Of constipation.

514
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,800
 (laughing)

515
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,200
 'Cause the bathroom door was locked.

516
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,240
 - Indeed, no, but the rest of the house was full of shit,

517
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,360
 but the time you got there.

518
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,800
 (laughing)

519
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,640
 And yeah, it was only in 2004,

520
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,040
 after she died that someone said,

521
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,880
 "Should we open that bathroom for the Frida color shit,

522
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,720
 "see what's in there?"

523
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,280
 And it's all her stuff, 22,000 documents,

524
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,400
 300 items of clothing, 6,000 photos,

525
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,640
 her prosthetic leg, her back brace.

526
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,480
 - Oh, wow.

527
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,640
 - All of her makeup textiles.

528
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,560
 - So why did she need the prosthetic leg

529
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,760
 and her back brace?

530
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,600
 - Oh, yes.

531
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,840
 Well, this is all part of her great stories,

532
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,640
 isn't it, of pain and injury?

533
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,960
 - Well, she had a terrible, nearly fatal bus crash

534
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,080
 when she was 18.

535
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,480
 She was involved in that.

536
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,880
 She had already got polio as a girl.

537
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,480
 She already had to wear a prosthesis

538
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,920
 on her right leg due to the polio.

539
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,720
 And then this bus crash completely wrecked her life.

540
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,320
 She broke her pelvis, her collarbone, her ribs, her back.

541
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,200
 Most of her life, she had to wear plaster corsets

542
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,240
 to support her.

543
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,560
 And so much of this, as Anna says, made its way in her art.

544
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,160
 - Frequently about pain.

545
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,000
 - Yeah, yeah.

546
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,840
 - I mean, it's frequently just this,

547
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,520
 she's got this really badly broken body

548
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,360
 for the back bone.

549
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,000
 - She also painted her casts quite a lot, didn't she?

550
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,840
 - Yeah.

551
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,600
 - Kind of some of the first paintings she did was on her casts.

552
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,200
 And she even painted the bus that hit her on her cast,

553
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,600
 which I think is pretty badass.

554
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,040
 - We should talk a bit about this crash

555
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,440
 'cause it was an extreme crash.

556
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,520
 She was with her boyfriend.

557
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,800
 She was about 18, it was 1925.

558
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:52,680
 And basically a tram plowed very slowly into their bus.

559
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,800
 And the boyfriend remembers his knees

560
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,920
 were suddenly touching the knees

561
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,520
 of the people sitting on the bench opposite as it bent.

562
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,520
 And then the whole vehicle splintered

563
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,880
 into a million pieces.

564
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,200
 And as well as all those horrendous breakages

565
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,840
 were the worst thing that happened

566
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,560
 was she got impaled on a steel handrail

567
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,520
 that went straight through her abdomen.

568
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:13,560
 And she didn't realize at the time

569
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,600
 the extent of her injuries.

570
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,280
 It's like, I guess you don't in the shock of the moment.

571
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,720
 She said, "The first thing I thought of

572
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,000
 was this Mexican toy that I just got."

573
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,240
 And I thought, "Oh, no, where is it?"

574
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,800
 I've lost it in the wreckage.

575
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,640
 - Yeah, right.

576
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,640
 - And her boyfriend looked at him and was like,

577
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,960
 "Yeah, you're also impaled on a large metal spike."

578
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,200
 And they had to pull it out.

579
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,440
 - Oh, God, and also there are the mad details

580
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,080
 that she's covered in blood, obviously.

581
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,400
 But then someone, who they speculated

582
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,600
 was probably a house painter,

583
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:41,000
 was carrying a big box of gold paint, sparkly gold paint.

584
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,560
 And that sort of flew through the air

585
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,280
 and landed all over her as well.

586
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,120
 - Oh my God.

587
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,040
 - So she was covered in blood

588
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,920
 with all these gold sprinkles all over her.

589
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,360
 - And then a piano that was being lifted

590
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,880
 into a building dropped on top of her.

591
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,600
 - Yeah, so every laurel in heart.

592
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,880
 - It is absolutely extraordinary.

593
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,320
 It's just really, really kind of broccoli awful.

594
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,000
 So she started painting partly in recovery

595
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,400
 from this.

596
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,280
 And she's an amazing artist.

597
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:05,040
 I didn't really know much of her work before this.

598
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,200
 And like frequently self-portraits

599
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,560
 and self-portraits throughout her life, you know?

600
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,760
 And then she met Diego Rivera,

601
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,680
 who was a mural painter.

602
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,520
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

603
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,360
 Incredibly famous.

604
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,200
 - Incredibly famous.

605
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,240
 - Much older than her, like 20 years of senior.

606
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,320
 - Yeah. - Twice her age.

607
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,160
 - Twice her age.

608
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,160
 She'd been married twice before.

609
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,640
 His doctor had told him he was unfit for monogamy

610
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,760
 as a diagnosis.

611
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,600
 - Is he?

612
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,400
 (laughing)

613
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,720
 - Oh, you look like you're out with the doctor

614
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,800
 when you book that GP appointment.

615
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,960
 - I just know that when you book a doctor's appointment

616
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,560
 in the UK, I don't know if it's for everyone,

617
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,880
 but I have to go on a website

618
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,000
 and I have to click all the things that are wrong with me.

619
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,840
 - Me too.

620
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,320
 - And monogamy has never been one of the checkmasters.

621
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,400
 - Did he have that as like, you know, if he got caught,

622
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,840
 he would show that note to his partner.

623
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,120
 And just saying, I think he did get caught a lot.

624
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,600
 I mean, he had so many affairs.

625
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,600
 - Yeah, so did she.

626
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,440
 - Yeah.

627
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,200
 - Well, she made a tortoise out of him.

628
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,000
 I'll tell you that much.

629
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,160
 But he also made a tortoise out of her a lot.

630
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,800
 - So what's the making the tortoise?

631
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,280
 - We're in Northern China, I know.

632
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,560
 - Sorry, I forgot that bit.

633
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,560
 - Her sister he hadn't affair with?

634
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,400
 - Yeah.

635
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,360
 - God's sake, Diego.

636
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,160
 - Well, they had a very interesting setup though.

637
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,040
 When they moved into their marital house,

638
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:16,280
 weirdly, it was two houses connected by a rooftop bridge.

639
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,640
 And so he had his studio in one of them.

640
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,440
 She had her studio in the other,

641
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,720
 but they just had their own pads

642
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,800
 for sleeping with him models and assistants

643
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:29,360
 and her with just men and women that she fancied.

644
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,200
 - And Leon Trotsky.

645
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,720
 - And Leon Trotsky.

646
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,880
 - Right, the twist.

647
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,080
 - What a cameo.

648
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,640
 - Extraordinary.

649
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,960
 - I can't get over the Trotsky thing.

650
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,280
 I can't get over the fact that she hadn't affair

651
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,200
 with Leon Trotsky.

652
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,600
 When he was, you know, he'd fled.

653
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,880
 He'd been kicked out of Russia, hadn't he,

654
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,720
 after the revolution.

655
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,840
 - So he was like a revolutionary

656
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,560
 who fell out with Stalin, basically.

657
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,200
 - That was not the thing to do in the thirties.

658
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,040
 - Oh no.

659
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,880
 - No, no, no, no.

660
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,200
 - All the people in the world to fall out with,

661
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,400
 he was one of the worst.

662
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,040
 - Absolutely, absolutely.

663
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,840
 - And he needed someone to go, didn't he,

664
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,680
 that we're safe.

665
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,000
 And actually it was Diego.

666
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 - I'd done it.

667
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,040
 - Spoiler, he was assassinated a few years later

668
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,320
 by one of Stalin's henchmen.

669
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,160
 - Sure.

670
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,440
 - So he didn't find that place in the end.

671
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,280
 - No.

672
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,880
 - But he did meet Diego and Frieda

673
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,440
 and they banged the Mexican president

674
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,720
 to let him into the country and his house him.

675
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,760
 So the president said, okay, we'll house him

676
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,480
 and then they kept him in that house for two years

677
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,040
 and their affair was very short.

678
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,080
 It was just at the start in 1937.

679
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,640
 - He was also very done.

680
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,640
 - Yes, and he was very--

681
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,000
 - He was married, Mrs. Trotsky was around.

682
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,400
 Mrs. Trotsky is a funny name.

683
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,320
 I just think that's a funny, you don't think of,

684
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,080
 and is there a Mrs. Trotsky, you know?

685
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,600
 - It sounds like a little piglet.

686
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,960
 - A pig mind a character.

687
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,480
 (all laughing)

688
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,400
 But some of their meetings,

689
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,080
 Frieda's and Leon Trotsky's, they took place

690
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,560
 at the house of the very sister

691
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,800
 who had slept with Frieda's husband, Diego.

692
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,640
 - Right.

693
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,480
 - Oh, it's messy.

694
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,280
 - His death was wild as well, Trotsky's.

695
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,120
 - Trotsky's?

696
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,120
 - Because he was killed with a nice pig,

697
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,880
 and the guy was a mountaineer who did it,

698
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,080
 so he knew how to swing one,

699
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,040
 and he thought I could probably get it in two goes.

700
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:01,960
 He didn't want to fire a gun,

701
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,200
 because he didn't want to raise noise.

702
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,840
 He needed to escape from this compound

703
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,080
 that Trotsky was staying in.

704
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,880
 So, but he did it, it went into his skull,

705
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,600
 but not deep enough to kill him.

706
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,840
 So Trotsky was running around,

707
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,000
 going, there's a nice pig in my head.

708
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,680
 Can we talk about the brows?

709
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,520
 - A famous brow.

710
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,360
 - The bruise.

711
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,640
 - Oh, okay, her brows, her brow.

712
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,320
 She emphasized that, didn't she?

713
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,160
 - Yeah.

714
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,920
 - She painted it on, she made it up.

715
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,040
 She emphasized her moustache as well.

716
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,040
 She had a tiny little bit of moustache-ness,

717
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,440
 but she really emphasized it to make herself seem

718
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,040
 strong, basically, at masculine.

719
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,080
 - Yeah, yeah.

720
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,840
 - She did really like that sort of,

721
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,840
 she really did push her brands, didn't she?

722
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,520
 Like, she claimed that she was born on a day

723
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,560
 that she wasn't born at,

724
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,640
 'cause it was the same year as the Mexican Revolution.

725
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,480
 - Oh really?

726
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,640
 - Yeah, I mean, three years apart.

727
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,960
 It wasn't like she claimed she was born the next week.

728
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,960
 She killed her three years later.

729
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,800
 - Wow.

730
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,480
 - Coincidence, it makes her three years younger.

731
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,840
 - But then, of course, like, it's still the case now.

732
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,800
 We're like, Frida Kahlo.

733
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,480
 If you look at all the kind of art books

734
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,480
 that my daughter's got three years old

735
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,160
 of all got Frida Kahlo in.

736
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,480
 'Cause she's just such a brand, isn't she?

737
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,320
 - She invented an aesthetic that genuinely

738
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,400
 think my three year old

739
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,000
 would be able to recognize Frida Kahlo.

740
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,840
 - Yeah, right.

741
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,680
 - For sure.

742
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,960
 - Well, they did a Barbie of her as well.

743
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,800
 - Yeah.

744
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,760
 - And the Barbie got banned in Mexico

745
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,200
 because weirdly, they took away the monobrow

746
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,720
 as part of the look, this iconic look.

747
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,440
 They made her incredibly slim.

748
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,240
 So the family, basically.

749
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,840
 - Yeah, it wasn't the government banned there.

750
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,680
 - Yeah.

751
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:27,000
 - There was a lawsuit because they didn't want this

752
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,640
 to be sold in Mexico and they pulled off the shelves.

753
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,480
 - Yeah.

754
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,320
 - But it wasn't.

755
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,760
 - You wouldn't not have a monobrow out of the Barbie.

756
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,600
 - Yeah.

757
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,440
 - The most famous thing about her.

758
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,920
 It's extraordinary, isn't it?

759
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,720
 - And so Andy, as you said, she did paint herself a lot.

760
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,480
 So apparently, in total, it's 143 paintings.

761
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,360
 55 of which were self portraits.

762
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,640
 And they're very surrealistic.

763
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:50,160
 I didn't realize she was as surreal as she was.

764
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,120
 There's one, which is called my birth,

765
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,480
 where she's giving birth to herself.

766
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,040
 So you see her head coming out of her own vagina.

767
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,480
 You don't see that it's her because there's a sheet

768
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,640
 over the head of the person giving birth.

769
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,080
 But through notes that she left in her diary and so on,

770
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:09,080
 we know that that was her being represented underneath the sheet.

771
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,600
 Now that is owned by Madonna.

772
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:15,120
 We know that Madonna owns roughly five self portraits

773
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,160
 by Frida Kahlo, two of which we know the names of that one.

774
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,840
 And then there's another one where there's a monkey

775
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,520
 on the side of her arm.

776
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,360
 - And Madonna got that one.

777
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,360
 - Yeah, Madonna's got that.

778
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,200
 Yeah.

779
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,880
 And Madonna has been quoted in Vanity Fair

780
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,760
 saying when she brings people over who are new people in her life,

781
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,640
 she'll show them the my birth one.

782
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,240
 And if they don't like it, she'll know

783
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,720
 that they're not going to be a long-term friend.

784
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,520
 - I feel really sad about that.

785
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,440
 - About what?

786
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,480
 - That I'm never going to be friends with Madonna.

787
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,480
 (laughing)

788
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,320
 - Do you know why?

789
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,080
 - I do like lots of Frida Kahlo stuff, but that, honestly,

790
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,680
 it's a bit much for me.

791
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,520
 - For me, right.

792
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,400
 - But my question is, would you really be honest about that?

793
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,240
 - If Madonna asks, I think no one's saying to Madonna to her face.

794
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,400
 I don't like your painting.

795
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,240
 - Yeah.

796
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,600
 - I think she's like, well, everyone's my friend.

797
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:58,040
 James is actually the only person I know who might just say,

798
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:58,880
 I really hate that.

799
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,720
 - You know what?

800
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,560
 - You should take it down.

801
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,480
 - Actually, I didn't really care for like a virgin.

802
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,320
 (laughing)

803
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,080
 - Ouch, okay, well, we can't be friends now.

804
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,400
 (laughing)

805
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,980
 (upbeat music)

806
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:12,960
 - Okay, it is time for a final factor of the show.

807
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,280
 And that is James.

808
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,840
 - My fact this week is that actor Noel Gubiemi

809
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,920
 played Hector in the Fast and the Furious.

810
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,400
 Since then, he has played a character called Hector

811
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,480
 in 30 other projects.

812
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,400
 And now, if he's in a movie where he's not called Hector,

813
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,160
 he'll try to change the character's name to Hector.

814
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,020
 - Yeah.

815
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:32,860
 - What?

816
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:35,080
 - He's, is he confused about acting?

817
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:35,920
 What, acting?

818
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,440
 - He's found his niche.

819
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,280
 - Yeah, he's a Hector.

820
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,400
 - So basically, this is something I saw in an interview

821
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,160
 with Los Angeles Radio Station.

822
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,240
 And apparently, started as a coincidence.

823
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:50,140
 So the writers just were looking for a Hispanic name.

824
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:53,480
 And they would often just come up with Hector or Carlos

825
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,520
 because it's like not the most obvious,

826
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,480
 but it's like one of the most obvious.

827
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,300
 - Interesting.

828
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,680
 I didn't, so it's like not calling your English character John,

829
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,320
 it's calling him Michael.

830
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,160
 Do you know what I mean?

831
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,680
 - Yeah, 'cause I used to just get Hector

832
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,880
 just with the Trojan War.

833
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,720
 - Yeah.

834
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,320
 - And I can think of it in a Hispanic sense.

835
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,200
 - Well, it is kind of a popular Hispanic name.

836
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,080
 - So in Puerto Rico right now, Hector is the 18th most

837
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:20,040
 popular name, which is beaten by Michael Kevin and Brian.

838
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,400
 But in the '80s and '90s and early 2000s,

839
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,400
 it was very popular.

840
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,520
 So these characters, this guy is in his 30s.

841
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,920
 So his character, people of that age were called Hector

842
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,560
 quite a lot in the Hispanic speaking world.

843
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,880
 And so yeah, it started as a coincidence.

844
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,240
 And then it was noted in an Instagram post

845
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,640
 and it went a bit viral and he sort of ran with it.

846
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,160
 And now sometimes in a movie, he'll get a choice

847
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,440
 to chase a name or keep it.

848
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,160
 And if he has the chance, he'll always say,

849
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,720
 "Now I want to be Hector."

850
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,520
 - Well, he's got a hell of a list of movies he's done.

851
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,680
 He's been in so many movies.

852
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,960
 So Hector's not even the only recurring name

853
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,400
 that has come up in his movies.

854
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,760
 So he's played Jose four times.

855
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,760
 He's played Cruz twice.

856
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,920
 - So I would say Jose is the straight up

857
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,840
 first Hispanic name you would go to, right?

858
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,680
 - Yeah, okay.

859
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,520
 - No way.

860
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,640
 (laughing)

861
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,640
 - Just put it in anywhere.

862
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,640
 (laughing)

863
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,680
 - Well, how about this one then?

864
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,720
 Twice, he's played someone called Gang Banger One.

865
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,840
 (laughing)

866
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:20,880
 Again, that's the 19th most popular name in Florida right now.

867
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,600
 - This is not an unrelated film.

868
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,120
 (laughing)

869
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,480
 - He completely is.

870
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,320
 - No.

871
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,640
 - So when he did it, Gang Banger One,

872
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,280
 he's listed in the X-Files.

873
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,000
 - And that's just a gang member, we should say.

874
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,040
 It's just someone who's in gang fights a lot.

875
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,200
 - Oh, is it?

876
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,360
 - Oh, grow up guys.

877
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,200
 - What?

878
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,040
 - I've never heard of that.

879
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:38,880
 - I've never heard of that.

880
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,680
 - He's a Gang Banger, is very common.

881
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,080
 Come to South London, you'll hear it said.

882
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,080
 It's someone who's in a gang.

883
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,240
 It's someone who gets him gang fights.

884
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,080
 - Are you sure?

885
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,480
 - Who plays the drum in the gang?

886
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,400
 - No, just anyone.

887
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,880
 - Any gang, yeah.

888
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,720
 - Are you sure?

889
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,960
 - I'm positive.

890
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,280
 I remember from my time in the Peckham crew, all right?

891
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,320
 (laughing)

892
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,480
 - I remember from my time in the Orgy.

893
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,480
 (laughing)

894
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,920
 We all had a different understanding.

895
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,240
 - So yeah, it's an old fashioned term.

896
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,320
 It's not as much used these days out.

897
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,160
 - That's right.

898
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,960
 - Because I would say probably, my memory of the X-Files

899
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,720
 is there would be more likely to be gangs than...

900
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,560
 - The bags.

901
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,400
 - The bags.

902
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,240
 - Yeah.

903
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,480
 Well, the other time was in a movie called Out of Sight,

904
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,040
 which is listed on his Wikipedia,

905
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,320
 but not listed on IMDB,

906
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,120
 and I didn't have time to watch the movie.

907
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,720
 - Wait, not out of sight with George Clooney and...

908
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,560
 - And Jennifer Lopez.

909
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,400
 - And Jennifer Lopez.

910
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,760
 - And I'm amazingly bad film.

911
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,480
 - Well, yeah, he's had so many roles.

912
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,880
 He's been called Snuffy, Chicken,

913
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,640
 Lord of the Garbage, Subway Guy,

914
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,520
 Sam the Man, Random,

915
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,120
 why didn't he demand to always be called Lord of the Garbage?

916
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,080
 (laughing)

917
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,080
 - That's a Michael flatly dance that I didn't really want to see.

918
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,600
 (laughing)

919
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,720
 - Latin Guy on a bicycle,

920
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,320
 and that was in the video clip

921
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,960
 for Pretty Fly For A White Guy.

922
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,960
 The offspring is in that.

923
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,800
 - It's in that.

924
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,960
 - He's in that.

925
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,040
 - Yeah, very good.

926
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,400
 - Character names are funny, are they?

927
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,240
 - Kambi.

928
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,200
 - Often, they express something about the character.

929
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,000
 - Yeah, like some writers will,

930
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,400
 as soon as you see a character's name,

931
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,280
 you'll know exactly what they do.

932
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,520
 Like Dickens, for instance, called JK Rowling.

933
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,360
 - Exactly.

934
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,360
 - But then other ones,

935
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,440
 they would just call themselves Jack Reacher,

936
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,520
 and you don't know what that is.

937
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,120
 It's just a person called Jack.

938
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:13,960
 - Exactly.

939
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,080
 And so the Dickens character's,

940
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,560
 and they're called Crathillic Names,

941
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,800
 which I didn't know.

942
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,120
 They dates back to Platonic Dialogue.

943
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,480
 So there's a Platonic Dialogue,

944
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,480
 which is all about,

945
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,040
 is your name relevant to your character.

946
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,720
 And so when Dickens has Mr. Bumble,

947
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,000
 or Mr. Murd Stone,

948
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,800
 who's a tough, hard character,

949
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,640
 that just...

950
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,080
 - Who's the Mr. Chokam,

951
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,480
 something in... - Chokam Child.

952
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,320
 - Chokam Child.

953
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,160
 - Yeah.

954
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,920
 - That's a really rubbish one.

955
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,480
 But so there's this story about Dickens

956
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,120
 that Tiny Tim was allegedly going to be called

957
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,000
 Puny Pete at one point.

958
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,800
 And it's, I have been trying to nail this

959
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,120
 because I don't think it's actually true.

960
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:52,360
 Like there's this piece from Dickens Quarterly in 1995,

961
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,800
 which says actually this might be from an advert,

962
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,120
 'cause there was an advert which said,

963
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,000
 little Larry, small Sam, Puny Pete,

964
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,880
 they were all crossed out,

965
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,560
 and then below it it says Tiny Tim.

966
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,400
 - Not crossed out.

967
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,240
 - Not crossed out.

968
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,880
 And it's saying like, sometimes you have to iterate

969
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,000
 and go through a few versions

970
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:05,840
 before you get the final thing.

971
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,840
 So that might be,

972
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,960
 that's a common internet factoid

973
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,400
 that actually might not be.

974
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,440
 - It's one of my favourite things we do

975
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,760
 is explode misconceptions

976
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,480
 that only two people had.

977
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,120
 Those two people will be listeners.

978
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:16,960
 So it's good.

979
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:22,720
 - This guy, Hector, arguably is Typecast.

980
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:26,480
 He's doing quite similar characters in all these things.

981
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:31,480
 IMDB has a category of the most Typecast actors in the world

982
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,640
 and it explains the kind of character that they do.

983
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,000
 So I want to do a quiz where I'll give you the explanation

984
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,880
 of the character and you have to say the name of the actor

985
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,160
 that they're describing.

986
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,280
 So easy one to start off with.

987
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,800
 Neurotic, sex-obsessed, intellectual.

988
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,800
 - Woody Allen.

989
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,120
 - Straight in there.

990
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,840
 If at home you got that quicker than Dan and Andy Weldon.

991
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:56,280
 Greasy, weasily, slightly mental creep.

992
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,480
 - That's Dan, isn't it?

993
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,200
 That's, he didn't do much acting.

994
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,960
 - I've got that one credit.

995
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:02,960
 Gang banger too.

996
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:07,080
 - Alan Whitman?

997
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,960
 - No, Greasy Weasily, slightly mental creep.

998
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,880
 - And when I tell you, you'll go, oh yeah.

999
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,320
 - Okay, hang on a sec.

1000
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:16,080
 - Oh, no, I can picture him on my head, stupid Chevy.

1001
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,960
 - Correct, that's who I was going for as well.

1002
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,880
 - Yes, okay, well done, Andy and me.

1003
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:25,680
 - Offbeat quirky hipster who's a little stuck

1004
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,920
 in Dreamland.

1005
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:27,920
 - Michael Sarah?

1006
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,240
 - No, it's.

1007
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,680
 - Ah, that annoying woman.

1008
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,680
 - Yeah.

1009
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,680
 God.

1010
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,160
 - I need to pick the mom in Paddington.

1011
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,000
 - I mean Sally Hawkins.

1012
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,080
 - Sally Hawkins.

1013
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,560
 - Oh, no, it's not her.

1014
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,400
 - Is it a woman?

1015
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,400
 - It's a woman.

1016
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,200
 - Offbeat, say it again.

1017
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,800
 - Offbeat quirky hipster who's a little stuck in Dreamland.

1018
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,640
 I'll tell you this one.

1019
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,480
 - Is it Woody Deschanel?

1020
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,320
 - It's correct.

1021
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,160
 - Yes.

1022
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,240
 - I don't know what that is.

1023
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,920
 - A tough woman who eventually shows vulnerability

1024
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,040
 by breaking down in a crying scene.

1025
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,120
 - Sigourney Weaver?

1026
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,440
 - She doesn't break down in crying scenes.

1027
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,280
 - She breaks others.

1028
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,200
 - Mell Street.

1029
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,040
 - Who's he saying?

1030
00:42:59,040 --> 00:42:59,880
 - Mell Street.

1031
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:00,720
 - Mell Street.

1032
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,200
 - No, we're kind of getting there.

1033
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,040
 - Julia Roberts.

1034
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:03,880
 - Correct.

1035
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:04,720
 - Oh.

1036
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,120
 - He's back in the game.

1037
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,680
 - Is she a tough woman?

1038
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,520
 - Yeah.

1039
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,360
 - Okay.

1040
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,760
 - Finally in this quiz, immature man child.

1041
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,600
 - Adam Sandler.

1042
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,440
 - Correct.

1043
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,440
 (all laughing)

1044
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,280
 - It's good.

1045
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,120
 - Oh, sorry guys.

1046
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,120
 - That's quite striking.

1047
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:19,960
 - No, it's very good.

1048
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,200
 - Oh, clearly they come across.

1049
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,360
 - So the tight casting is so dangerous for actors.

1050
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,200
 - There's an ed O'Neill.

1051
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,200
 There used to be a sitcom married with children.

1052
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,360
 If you can't picture him from that,

1053
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:32,120
 he was in that, he's in modern family as well

1054
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:34,880
 as one of the husbands in it.

1055
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,120
 - It was like a long suffering husband.

1056
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,160
 - Yeah, incredibly funny to the point

1057
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,840
 where he almost just had to shrug and people would laugh.

1058
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:44,600
 And so he was in a movie called Flight of the Intruder,

1059
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,680
 Drama Movie, 1991 it came out.

1060
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,520
 Test audiences kept on laughing.

1061
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,840
 Anytime he came on screen or did any movement

1062
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,200
 that he was just cut from the film.

1063
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,040
 - Wow.

1064
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,360
 - They were like, you're ruining the film.

1065
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,200
 You're too funny.

1066
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,560
 You're too funny at the moment.

1067
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,400
 - That's tough.

1068
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,240
 - That's the tight casting.

1069
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,600
 It isn't real thing, isn't it?

1070
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,200
 So there's an actor called Mikael Gillavani

1071
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:06,240
 who played Stalin in 12 different films

1072
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,480
 made during Stalin's lifetime.

1073
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,480
 And then the work did dry up.

1074
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,280
 (all laughing)

1075
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,080
 - Why are we gonna get a job now at Leaves

1076
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,080
 in the right country?

1077
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,560
 - Yeah, I read about him.

1078
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:20,240
 He basically played Stalin in one movie

1079
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,360
 and Stalin really, really liked him

1080
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:25,320
 because he was by far the most handsome and tallest

1081
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,480
 member of the cast and he was playing Stalin.

1082
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:30,960
 And Stalin was like, that's exactly who should be playing me.

1083
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,160
 And then from then on, yeah,

1084
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,920
 he was like, this guy is gonna play me all the time.

1085
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,480
 And obviously there were quite a few movies

1086
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,600
 about Stalin made.

1087
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:38,440
 - Yes.

1088
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,280
 - And when the casting call comes in,

1089
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,680
 it must be a tricky, like, do you wanna take this job?

1090
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,800
 - It is time casting me.

1091
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,560
 - But I'll be killed if I don't do it.

1092
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,120
 - But yeah, then after Chris Chev did that speech

1093
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,880
 that said to Stalin was a wanker, then no more.

1094
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:53,840
 - No, James Doohan had a horrible one.

1095
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:56,680
 James Doohan was scotty in Star Trek.

1096
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,320
 So he was the guy who would fix things.

1097
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,160
 He had a Scottish accent.

1098
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,520
 He kept not getting films off the back of it

1099
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:05,080
 because they kept saying, we don't need a Scottish guy

1100
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,240
 in this movie.

1101
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,680
 He was Canadian, that was just an accent.

1102
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:11,320
 But he was so tight cast to that character

1103
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,920
 that yeah, he lost roles.

1104
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:16,640
 - I was told, did you guys read about Jagdish Raj Kuranah,

1105
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,120
 who's a, he's got Guinness World Record,

1106
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:21,960
 he's a body with actor, he was, he died in 2013.

1107
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,920
 He's got a Guinness World Record

1108
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,200
 for being the most tight cast actor.

1109
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:30,080
 And he played the role of a police inspector in 144 films.

1110
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:30,920
 - Wow.

1111
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:35,160
 - Which is just, and I looked at his whole Wikipedia list of films.

1112
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,880
 And God, he worked hard.

1113
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,680
 Small bit parters were bloody hard.

1114
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,040
 They do about 10 films a year.

1115
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,160
 So he also played a doctor 10 times.

1116
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:45,040
 And he had various ones where you'd think maybe

1117
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,360
 he wasn't gonna be a policeman,

1118
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:50,720
 like a film called 'Soo Hog' and he's visiting a brothel

1119
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,400
 and he's a bit of an underworld character.

1120
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,480
 - Bicking up a gang wanger.

1121
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:54,320
 - Exactly.

1122
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:57,080
 - He's doing some gang banging undercover cop.

1123
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:57,920
 There we go.

1124
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,000
 - That's good.

1125
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,280
 - But if you know the actor, you will know

1126
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:01,520
 he will turn out to be a cop, right?

1127
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,680
 - Yeah, you're so right, that ruins it.

1128
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:07,000
 - Yeah, I read that he had his own police uniform

1129
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,360
 that he used to keep up, 'cause he was gonna be a policeman

1130
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,880
 so often in his movies.

1131
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,120
 And he has his son called Bobby.

1132
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,800
 - Oh, no.

1133
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,640
 - Nice.

1134
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:16,640
 - Lovely stuff.

1135
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,920
 - You know how Jack Reacher, the character, got his name?

1136
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:22,920
 'Cause Lee Child chose his pen name

1137
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,640
 because it would be between Raymond Chanber

1138
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,880
 and Agatha Christie is the story, okay?

1139
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,080
 But Jack Reacher, the character, is named

1140
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:32,400
 because he's good at reaching things.

1141
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,680
 So Lee Child is very tall, right?

1142
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:35,920
 That is true.

1143
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,160
 And he started writing these books

1144
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,240
 during a period of unemployment.

1145
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,040
 He used to be like a 90 feet floor manager, I think.

1146
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:43,080
 And he was sacked from that job and started writing.

1147
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:44,720
 But during that period where he was unemployed,

1148
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,200
 when he was in the supermarket,

1149
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,880
 or little odd ladies would sometimes say,

1150
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,000
 "Can you reach that thing for me down?"

1151
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,080
 And his wife used to tease him,

1152
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:53,320
 saying, "Maybe you could get a job as being a Reacher."

1153
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:56,400
 And he's since turned that into a globe straddling

1154
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,440
 like the cultural empire of--

1155
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,280
 - So funny.

1156
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,920
 - And I haven't read or seen the films,

1157
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:03,640
 but is Jack Reacher someone who's always fitting like bulbs?

1158
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:04,640
 Is he a handyman?

1159
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,520
 - He's basically like a human Mr. Tickle.

1160
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,720
 - Right, okay, there's so much more fun than they hear.

1161
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,480
 - Yeah, he is very, the character is very tall.

1162
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:17,280
 - Which was the huge controversy when Tom Cruise was cast,

1163
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,120
 because he was--

1164
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,200
 - Oh my god.

1165
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,360
 - Yeah, honestly, what everyone--

1166
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:23,160
 - There's someone who doesn't get type cast as a shartass.

1167
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:24,000
 - Does he?

1168
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,400
 - Jack Reacher's six, five, I believe.

1169
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,240
 - Is he?

1170
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,080
 - Is he?

1171
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,160
 - Yeah, and he's a tough guy.

1172
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,120
 I think there's one book where he stops a bullet

1173
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:34,400
 with his chest, and that's right.

1174
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,880
 - That's not easy to do, can I just say?

1175
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,040
 But it's not that easy to survive it.

1176
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:39,880
 - Sorry.

1177
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:42,240
 (laughing)

1178
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,080
 - Yes.

1179
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:44,840
 - I'm sort of a, I know I'm not used to this part,

1180
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:47,600
 but I'm astonished that he, specifically a 6.5

1181
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,760
 and he's played by Tom Cruise.

1182
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:49,760
 Was that a funny joke?

1183
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,400
 - No, the first Jack Reacher film with Tom Cruise is brilliant.

1184
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,240
 It's really good.

1185
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,080
 The second one is also decent.

1186
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:55,920
 - Yeah, go back.

1187
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,920
 - Do they have very small actors around him

1188
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:58,920
 to make him look tall?

1189
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:00,200
 - They cast only bunch of kids.

1190
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:03,480
 Yeah, and he beats up a hell of a lot of bunch of kids

1191
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,320
 in that film.

1192
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:07,200
 - No, you're right.

1193
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,080
 I think they just show him like he's short,

1194
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:11,840
 but he's accelerating up towards your face with his fists.

1195
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:12,680
 - I see.

1196
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:13,520
 - Right.

1197
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,360
 - Oh, it's good.

1198
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,960
 - It's not mentioned in the movie, his height.

1199
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,440
 It's how they go around it.

1200
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:21,040
 They don't go, "Oh my God, he's huge."

1201
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,920
 - They don't call him Jack Cart Reacher.

1202
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:25,200
 (laughing)

1203
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:29,200
 - Dan, I have a fact that I wonder if you know,

1204
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:32,880
 or anyone, in absolutely fabulous,

1205
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,240
 internationalist as great British comedy,

1206
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:40,240
 Jennifer Saunders' character is Eddie, Adina Monsoon.

1207
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,440
 Do you know why she's called that?

1208
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:42,440
 - Hmm.

1209
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:44,760
 - Can you work it out if you know stuff about her life,

1210
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,000
 which I reckon you do?

1211
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,840
 Eddie Monsoon is her name.

1212
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,200
 - Eddie Monsoon.

1213
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:52,240
 - Eddie Monsoon, do you know any about her personal life?

1214
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,600
 - Yeah, she's married to Adrian Edmondson,

1215
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,360
 and he's Eddie in bottom.

1216
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:57,440
 - Ed Monsoon.

1217
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,440
 - There you go.

1218
00:48:58,440 --> 00:48:59,280
 - Wow.

1219
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,120
 - There you go.

1220
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:00,960
 - That's an incredible fact.

1221
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,200
 - Isn't that nice?

1222
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,200
 - Ed Monsoon.

1223
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,520
 - Ed Monsoon.

1224
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:05,360
 - Very good.

1225
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:06,200
 - There you go.

1226
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,680
 It's a shame that Andy had to get that for you,

1227
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,040
 but you helped him.

1228
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,120
 - Made it all the more exciting.

1229
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:13,360
 - You two are working as a great team today.

1230
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:16,200
 (laughing)

1231
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,560
 - So sometimes character names can get you in trouble.

1232
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:19,480
 - Oh yeah.

1233
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:23,160
 - There is a writer called Jake Arnett, author of books.

1234
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,240
 And in 2006 he was writing a book,

1235
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:28,520
 and he had a character in it who was a real villain.

1236
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:30,920
 It was a 1960s cabaret singer,

1237
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,000
 and he named him Tony Rocco, right?

1238
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,760
 And the character was a real sleaze bag

1239
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,680
 who preyed on teenage boys.

1240
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:41,920
 Now unfortunately for Jake Arnett,

1241
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,360
 there was a real 1960s London cabaret singer

1242
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:47,040
 called Tony Rocco, who was not a pervert

1243
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,200
 who preyed on teenage boys.

1244
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,880
 And he was still trading,

1245
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,920
 having had a very successful hit single

1246
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,000
 and was still performing with a loyal fan base.

1247
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:54,840
 - Wow.

1248
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,840
 - Obviously he was not happy when this book came out.

1249
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:59,000
 - Was it a complete coincidence?

1250
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,320
 - It was a complete coincidence.

1251
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,840
 He just, I don't know, he hadn't Googled it.

1252
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,520
 - So did he get sued?

1253
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:06,880
 - There was a legal process, which played out,

1254
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,840
 and led to some compensation being paid, I think.

1255
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,680
 And Tony Rocco, the real Tony Rocco said,

1256
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,800
 "I'm very glad we can just work this out and move on."

1257
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:17,560
 - There was a famous thing with Peter Kay in Phoenix night.

1258
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:18,400
 Was it in Phoenix night?

1259
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,480
 So the one that he did before that.

1260
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,840
 But it was one of his sitcoms

1261
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:24,480
 and there was a character called Keith Ladd

1262
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,080
 who was like a health and safety officer

1263
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:29,080
 who had sex with dogs.

1264
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:33,920
 And it turned out that Peter Kayd had previously worked

1265
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,760
 with the health and safety officer called Keith Ladd.

1266
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:37,600
 - Oh.

1267
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:40,280
 - And it was a complete coincidence.

1268
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,600
 - Was it really?

1269
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,200
 - It was, says Mr. Kayd.

1270
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,800
 And there was some legal process.

1271
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:48,280
 And again, I think some, some--

1272
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,000
 - A compensation was distributed.

1273
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,480
 - I believe it was.

1274
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:54,200
 - It might have been the compensation went to,

1275
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,440
 you know, fire safety thing.

1276
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,600
 - Well, dog trust.

1277
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,320
 (laughing)

1278
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:59,840
 - Well, then there were things within books

1279
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:03,200
 where people would add the detail of a small penis

1280
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,920
 if they were describing someone so that they would never sue

1281
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,240
 'cause they wouldn't want to admit that the character was them.

1282
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,160
 - Yes, it's not one prime prejudice.

1283
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,960
 It cut out chapter four, isn't it?

1284
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:13,840
 (laughing)

1285
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,280
 - But if I write a character called, like,

1286
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:19,440
 Den Tribeur, who's, I write as a really, a real bastard

1287
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,840
 and I say, and he's got a small penis,

1288
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,480
 is that gonna stop me sewing, Den?

1289
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,560
 - What the small penis bit?

1290
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:24,400
 - Yeah.

1291
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,720
 'Cause it's so obvious I'm making fun of you in the book.

1292
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:28,560
 - Yeah.

1293
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:29,800
 - And in fact, this is gonna be a great idea

1294
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:30,880
 for my next novel.

1295
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,280
 (laughing)

1296
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,160
 - This is small penis coming to it.

1297
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,880
 - Well, it's part of the reason he's cuckled it

1298
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,560
 by his Northern Chinese wife.

1299
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,440
 (laughing)

1300
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,680
 Well, I'd be angry, but this sounds so damn good.

1301
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:45,520
 (laughing)

1302
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,360
 I'm in.

1303
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:47,200
 (laughing)

1304
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,200
 - Well, you're not quite in.

1305
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,520
 (laughing)

1306
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:54,520
 (upbeat music)

1307
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:58,720
 - Okay, that's it.

1308
00:51:58,720 --> 00:51:59,960
