00:00:00,00:00:18,"""Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast"
00:00:18,00:00:21,"coming to you from the QI offices in Hobern."""
00:00:21,00:00:25,"This episode's Annotishinsky's last episode for a while, as she heads off onto maternity"
00:00:25,00:00:30,"leave. We'll be seeing her in nine months, but we've got one more episode. Once again,"
00:00:30,00:00:33,we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven
00:00:33,00:00:38,"days, and in a particular order, here we go. Starting with fact number one, and that"
00:00:38,00:00:45,"is my fact. My fact this week is that Harriet Beatrice Stowe, author of Uncle Tom's Cabin,"
00:00:45,00:00:53,wrote the novel for the first time twice. This is a story I found it on a website
00:00:53,00:00:59,"that is Uncle Tom's Cabin, an American culture. It's a dedicated page to all historical articles"
00:00:59,00:01:04,"about Harriet Beatrice Stowe. In it, it points out that near the end of her life, she was suffering"
00:01:04,00:01:09,"from a disease of the brain. She might have dementia, she might have Alzheimer's, we're"
00:01:09,00:01:15,"not quite sure. But in that period, she found herself rewriting as if it were a new story"
00:01:15,00:01:19,"Uncle Tom's Cabin, and telling everyone, ""I've got this amazing book that I'm writing."
00:01:19,00:01:23,"I think it's going to be big."" Apparently, when people were looking at the writing, it"
00:01:23,00:01:28,"was almost word for word what the original book was. The Washington Post said, ""If the"
00:01:28,00:01:33,"manuscript could be compared with the corresponding portions of the original copy, it is not likely"
00:01:33,00:01:36,"that much difference of appearance would be discovered."""
00:01:36,00:01:40,So it wasn't a big prose-lavery tract suddenly that she found herself producing in the
00:01:40,00:01:41,'80s.
00:01:41,00:01:45,"We should explain those two things, Harriet Beatrice Stowe, and Uncle Tom's Cabin, I guess."
00:01:45,00:01:51,"It's a property book, isn't it? How to make a desirable residence on a budget."
00:01:51,00:01:53,This is a game-changing book in America.
00:01:53,00:01:59,"Harriet Beatrice Stowe, she was very much against the world of slavery in America, came from"
00:01:59,00:02:05,"a family that was very, very much fighting that cause. So she wrote a series of stories"
00:02:05,00:02:11,"that were published, like how Dickens used to do it. It's serialized in a magazine."
00:02:11,00:02:15,"When the book came out, it just really hit a note. It suddenly made sense to a lot of"
00:02:15,00:02:19,white America about what was going on. There was this new thing that was put in place in
00:02:19,00:02:24,"this period whereby if you were caught housing a runaway slave, you were now going to jail,"
00:02:24,00:02:29,"or you were going to be fined, which meant that no one was looking after these people. And"
00:02:29,00:02:33,then there was very much parallels of what's going on right now in America. People were
00:02:33,00:02:38,"being taken away. Black Americans would know due process, and they were being jailed, and"
00:02:38,00:02:42,it was a hectic time. So this book was saying this is not acceptable.
00:02:42,00:02:45,"It arguably led to the civil war. I think, right?"
00:02:45,00:02:49,"Yeah, Lincoln jokes about that, didn't they? The little woman who started the civil war."
00:02:49,00:02:54,"I love that. So they met. Harriet Beatrice Stowe, Met Lincoln, and I think about 1862, and"
00:02:54,00:02:58,he supposedly said that to her on the little woman who wrote the book that started this
00:02:58,00:03:03,great war. I think it might be a later. Her family said it would have been said later.
00:03:03,00:03:05,They were allowed to do that. They achieved a lot of the family.
00:03:05,00:03:10,"But for sure, it did change a lot of minds in America. It was so, sorry to go into book"
00:03:10,00:03:16,"sales mode, but it was so successful. I think it sold 300,000 copies in the USA in its first"
00:03:16,00:03:20,"year. And it I think might have been the biggest seller of any book in that century, the"
00:03:20,00:03:25,"19th century, barring the Bible. I think it was. It was big. The time said that the amount"
00:03:25,00:03:30,"of royalties that she got is the largest sum of money ever received by any author, either"
00:03:30,00:03:35,"American or European, from the sales of a single work in such an amount of time."
00:03:35,00:03:38,Wow. Do you know what the second best selling book of the 1850s was?
00:03:38,00:03:44,"Oh, good question. 1850s. Is this guessable? Dickens? No, no, it's not guessable. I'd be astonished"
00:03:44,00:03:48,if you don't have it. Right. It hasn't had the same kind of longevity as Uncle Tom's
00:03:48,00:03:53,cabin. So Uncle Tom's cabin was the top. And then the second was called Ten Nights in
00:03:53,00:03:58,"a Bar, and what I saw there. Absolutely. That sounds awesome. It does sound like more fun"
00:03:58,00:04:03,"reading. Unless it's like, because I've been to bars regularly, and actually you tend"
00:04:03,00:04:06,"to see the same things again and again. It's like, oh, that group of people watching"
00:04:06,00:04:10,"the horse racing. Yeah, same like crying in the corner. There's Andy telling the same"
00:04:10,00:04:14,"anecdote over and over again. I empathise with Harriet and be just, I don't mean to trivialise"
00:04:14,00:04:17,"whatever condition she had, but like I frequently will get to the end of an anecdote and people"
00:04:17,00:04:22,"around me are going, yeah, yes, Andy, yes, that was, yeah, that was, that was an anecdote. I told"
00:04:22,00:04:27,"you. Half an hour ago. In that article, by the way, because I found it in the newspaper"
00:04:27,00:04:33,"archives, they also said that she had confusedly given permission to two publishers to write"
00:04:33,00:04:39,her official biography thinking that they were the same person. And there's a big sort of financial
00:04:39,00:04:44,"problem between those two companies. I can really imagine doing that now. Actually, like"
00:04:44,00:04:48,"you see that same, not very good with family. You've got face blindness. You've probably promised"
00:04:48,00:04:53,"your biography to ten of them. Yeah, I'm quite disappointed. It hasn't been written yet."
00:04:53,00:04:58,"What's really interesting is the reaction to the book. Because obviously, as we've also had"
00:04:58,00:05:03,"a huge reaction, there was a real life inspiration, a man called Josiah Henson, who was himself"
00:05:03,00:05:07,enslaved and in real life escaped to Canada and founded a settlement and a school for former
00:05:07,00:05:13,slaves. But what's amazing is after the book came out and had this huge social reaction
00:05:13,00:05:19,"and effect, there was a ferocious pro-slavery pushback even in the novel sphere. So at least"
00:05:19,00:05:25,"15 novels were published in response, very much in favor of slavery, saying slaves in the"
00:05:25,00:05:30,south are better off and then free men and women in the north. So one of them was called
00:05:30,00:05:36,"Uncle Robin in his cabin in Virginia and Tom, without one, in Boston. Not a good title."
00:05:36,00:05:42,"Like we can all agree. A shit title for a book. And the argument inside, obviously. Yeah."
00:05:42,00:05:47,"Yeah, and you were saying that it was kind of in magazines to start off with, it was serialized."
00:05:47,00:05:51,They also had pro-slavery magazines. Right. Basically doing the opposite. So if you went
00:05:51,00:05:57,"to WHO Smiths in mid-19th century America, on the shelves, you would have half of them"
00:05:57,00:06:00,"would be pro-slavery magazines and half would be anti-slavery magazines. Well, it was like"
00:06:00,00:06:06,"the BBC today. You've got to have balance, haven't you? If you get on then. Get on the"
00:06:06,00:06:10,"anti-fascist, you've got to get on the fascist. But she wrote another book off the back of Uncle"
00:06:10,00:06:14,"Tom's cabin, the key to Uncle Tom's cabin, which was basically a bibliography describing"
00:06:14,00:06:19,everything that had gone into Uncle Tom's cabin. She named Josiah Henson as the inspiration
00:06:19,00:06:22,"for the Uncle Tom character. Because they were like, oh, you just made it up. You'd never"
00:06:22,00:06:27,"even been here. You don't know any enslaved people. You just like, and she needed to prove"
00:06:27,00:06:30,"that it wasn't like that. Yeah. But good. I mean, great. When the publisher says, what's"
00:06:30,00:06:36,"next? Harriet? Well, it's more Uncle Tom's cabin in a good way. That's a good idea. Like,"
00:06:36,00:06:40,"you know, like the QI fat books that we used to write. We could write another one saying,"
00:06:40,00:06:45,"no, no, this is true. Well, that's the thing. Well, then I'm keeping our sources. Because"
00:06:45,00:06:48,"I have a panic attack every time James sent me an email going, and what is your source"
00:06:48,00:06:53,"for this? Like, I don't know. I do need it immediately. Which James, you want to publish"
00:06:53,00:07:01,a book of just pure URLs. It's the key to QI. I got another one of her writings. Lady Byron
00:07:01,00:07:08,"vindicated. Oh, yeah. This is where she gets spicy. Yeah. She was defending Byron's widow"
00:07:08,00:07:15,by revealing that Byron had an affair with his own sister half sister. Okay. Not that that
00:07:15,00:07:26,"changes matters. Sorry. Half sister. Oh, well, that's not even a fact then. Is that not interesting?"
00:07:26,00:07:32,"No, it was incredibly. This was a second most controversial book. I'd say when she published"
00:07:32,00:07:37,"this piece in the Atlantic, American magazine still going today, it lost them 15,000 subscribers"
00:07:37,00:07:41,"who said, I don't mind reading about various other things, but I draw the line at Law Byron"
00:07:41,00:07:45,"having an affair with his half sister. I think it was a third of a subscriber's cloud. I mean,"
00:07:45,00:07:49,"that's a big hit, isn't it? That's one article you feel so. You know what? She wrote another"
00:07:49,00:07:56,"book in 1873 called Women in Sacred History, where she said that one of the apostles was"
00:07:56,00:08:01,"a woman, Lydia. So she was just an edgelard. Yeah. It's just keeping coming. That's stunning."
00:08:01,00:08:05,"Yeah. And the clue is in the name, isn't it? Lydia the Apostle? Oh, there's no one else"
00:08:05,00:08:13,"in that. Did you say which of the apostles was? Yeah, Lydia. No, but which was that Thomas?"
00:08:13,00:08:18,"No, I think like the Bible, just there are actually 13 apostles, but the Bible never mentioned"
00:08:18,00:08:22,"it. See, it must have been one of the judices. Well, there were two judices. That's right."
00:08:22,00:08:26,Two James's. One of them must have been the Lydia. I reckon. You just like panicked and
00:08:26,00:08:30,"gave the name of the person she was looking at. That's what you do, isn't it? It's a Mrs."
00:08:30,00:08:35,"outfire moment. Just quickly on the on the Byron thing, because she was great mates with Lady Byron,"
00:08:35,00:08:41,"because after Uncle Tom's cabin, she met everyone. I mean, she was friends with so many"
00:08:41,00:08:46,"eminent people. George Elliott, wouldn't she? Great mates. But this wrecked her reputation,"
00:08:46,00:08:50,the Byron book. There was so much criticism. She had to hire a secretary to deal with the
00:08:50,00:08:55,"correspondence and hire a lawyer. And the person who stood up for her, I'm afraid enemy"
00:08:55,00:09:00,"of the podcast, Mark Twain, he stood up for her and he was really good about it. And I just"
00:09:00,00:09:04,"think that's inviscated a bit. They were mates. They were mates. They were mates, but have"
00:09:04,00:09:07,"you seen what he was running about her in their later life? Because they were neighbours,"
00:09:07,00:09:10,"not just mates. Oh, what did he say about her? I mean, it's not very nice."
00:09:10,00:09:16,She trimmed the head wrong. Yeah. That's not getting the garden. Dogwood shit in his garden.
00:09:16,00:09:20,"No, he said her mind had decayed and she was a pathetic figure. But I think he means"
00:09:20,00:09:27,"pathetic, not as in we mean pathetic. Yeah, that's not criticism. I read that wrong then."
00:09:27,00:09:31,"Yeah, that no pathetic back then would have meant someone that you feel really sorry for"
00:09:31,00:09:35,"because she's got really unwell. And then he wrote, people in the area where they both"
00:09:35,00:09:39,of them lived would leave their doors open and then Harriet Beecher Stowe would go into
00:09:39,00:09:49,"their houses and then push them over and go, ""Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop,"
00:09:49,00:09:52,"whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop. She wrote that as well."""
00:09:52,00:09:56,But then also that she would play her piano and you'd hear her singing melancholic songs to
00:09:56,00:10:00,"great effect. Right. Yeah, no, they were mates. They were mates. Okay, cool. Can we finally"
00:10:00,00:10:04,"talk about her husband? Because we talk about these women all the time on this podcast,"
00:10:04,00:10:09,"don't we? Agreed. She wrote a lot of stuff, but he did write a pamphlet."
00:10:09,00:10:16,And the pamphlet that he wrote described the frequent visitations from tiny fairies that
00:10:16,00:10:21,danced on his windowsill. Really? Yeah. And I bet he talked about his pamphlet much more
00:10:21,00:10:27,"than she talked about her, like 50 seminal books and crucial impact on 19th century literature."
00:10:27,00:10:32,"Well, I can tell you that his fairies that he saw were ruled over by King and Queen, who"
00:10:32,00:10:37,"were slightly larger than the other fairies, but they had a sinister and selfish expression"
00:10:37,00:10:40,"on their faces that stopped him from trusting them. Even though they always smiled, there"
00:10:40,00:10:44,"is something sinister about them, so he didn't trust these fairies. Sorry, is this a vision"
00:10:44,00:10:48,"he had, and then he wrote into a pamphlet? Or is this a metaphor for something? It's a metaphor."
00:10:48,00:10:52,"Yeah, it's what he thought, yeah. That's kind of sad, because I know he was very encouraging"
00:10:52,00:10:56,"of her, this very career, and she probably felt like she should do the same for him, but..."
00:10:56,00:11:00,"I just need a quick quote for the cover, darling, if that's all right. Just like something"
00:11:00,00:11:05,"about the fairies and how they're really well described or something. Yeah, yeah, well,"
00:11:05,00:11:07,"yeah. Sorry, I've got to go meet Queen Victoria now."
00:11:07,00:11:19,"Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy. My fact is, some tortoises have hinges."
00:11:19,00:11:26,"So these are imaginatively named animals called hingeback tortoises, and there are loads of species,"
00:11:26,00:11:31,and they have a hinge at the back. It's like a hatchback car. Yeah. And it means their back can
00:11:31,00:11:36,"just go boom, and close up when they're trying to retreat into their shell. There are loads of"
00:11:36,00:11:39,"different species. There's the forest, there's bells, there's the homes, there's the western."
00:11:39,00:11:44,"I saw some of them two weeks ago, which is why I submitted this fact, yeah. That's so cool."
00:11:44,00:11:49,Could you see the hinge? I couldn't get my arm quite far off into the enclosure to...
00:11:49,00:11:57,"It was a shame, but I read all about them. This was in a little rainforest experience near"
00:11:57,00:12:03,"Reading. It's the home of rainforest experiences. It's a fantastic place, like it's amazing,"
00:12:03,00:12:06,"the stuff they had there. Anyway, and they have these. Sorry, when you say retreat into their shell,"
00:12:06,00:12:09,"I would have thought that that would be on the front, then you'd put their head, retract"
00:12:09,00:12:12,"their heads in, and then they'd drop a hinge down. But what they're retreating their bottom into"
00:12:12,00:12:16,"their shell, and then they're... I think they're legs on their legs and their tail, basically."
00:12:16,00:12:20,"Their legs and their tail just go back in. I don't think any species has yet evolved a front hinge,"
00:12:20,00:12:24,"but that's something evolution is probably working on. So if the predates are comes from the front,"
00:12:24,00:12:28,"they're buggered. Well, I don't know. I mean, because you're always going to be running away from"
00:12:28,00:12:33,"a predator, aren't you? So it does make sense that you're closing the back. Yeah. They can retreat"
00:12:33,00:12:36,"a fair bit inside. I think they can pull, obviously, they can pull their heads in. I just don't know"
00:12:36,00:12:41,how far in. There are some which have a really awkward thing where they put their head in and to the
00:12:41,00:12:46,"side, and they just sort of scooch in there like that. I'm doing it now for the benefit of listeners."
00:12:46,00:12:49,"You've done a lot of physical stuff so far in this fact for the benefit of listeners,"
00:12:49,00:12:55,that they're enjoying. That's more to come. I believe also the hinge helps them to open their shell
00:12:55,00:13:01,"a bit further and lay their eggs. And they have eggs that are bigger than average for a turtle,"
00:13:01,00:13:06,which means that the hinge is useful. Brilliant. They're mutant turtles. They do live into their
00:13:06,00:13:10,"teens, I believe. Yeah. And we should say just because you've chucked in the word turtle now,"
00:13:10,00:13:13,"and I didn't look into them, but they are tortoises, right? Yeah, they are. Although they're"
00:13:13,00:13:16,"often used interchangeably, and we've talked about the difference. Well, tortoises are turtle,"
00:13:16,00:13:23,"but a turtle's not a tortoise. Yeah. Okay, I get it. Yeah. I don't. And they also, their shell,"
00:13:23,00:13:27,"is slightly different than normal shells. It's got a little channel that when it rains,"
00:13:27,00:13:31,the water goes down the channel and goes straight to their mouth. What no it doesn't.
00:13:31,00:13:36,They've got guttering. What do you mean? Like one of those American sports hats that has a straw
00:13:36,00:13:40,that comes right in. Exactly like that. They shouldn't be the hinge back tortoise. They should be
00:13:40,00:13:47,the beer can. That's tartar. That's unbelievable. Yeah. That's incredible. That's incredible.
00:13:47,00:13:52,"Evolution, man. I know we say it week in, week out on this show, but it's thrown up some cracking"
00:13:52,00:13:59,"stuff. It does well. Yeah. There are box turtles, and they are slightly different. I think they might"
00:13:59,00:14:04,"also be a kind of tortoise, but they're definitely called the box turtle, and they have a hinge on"
00:14:04,00:14:10,"their belly, which helps them to close the front and back half up like a box when they flex it."
00:14:10,00:14:15,"So they become, like all your innards are going to drop out every time you open it. I believe it goes"
00:14:15,00:14:22,"the opposite way to that. Yes. Right. I think it's closing up, not opening out. I'm splitting open."
00:14:22,00:14:28,I've got to pick that up. Yeah. I find that hard to visualise without anything. I'm not getting on
00:14:28,00:14:37,"the floor, but I'm sorry. But the eastern box turtle was going to be made the official state emblem,"
00:14:37,00:14:41,"or one of the official state emblems of Virginia. You know, every American state has like this is the"
00:14:41,00:14:47,"official state fern and the official state ice cream flavour. Yeah. Exactly. And so Virginia,"
00:14:47,00:14:51,"they suggested a couple of times in different years, bills to honour the eastern box turtle."
00:14:51,00:14:56,"And I just really like this. I think this is from the Wikipedia about them. In 2009,"
00:14:56,00:15:01,delegate Frank Hargrove of Hannover asked why Virginia would make an official emblem of an animal
00:15:01,00:15:06,that retreats into its shell when frightened and dies by the thousands crawling across roads.
00:15:06,00:15:10,"I just think that's such a mean thing. Yeah. Yeah, it's got other assets. It's not it's fault"
00:15:10,00:15:18,"that we've created the car. No, exactly. On turtles being able to do entertaining things."
00:15:18,00:15:26,"In the olden days, I found this out in a study which was called tortoise rides and alligator slides."
00:15:26,00:15:30,"In zoos that had tortoises, tortoise rides were the thing. It was like the donkey ride,"
00:15:30,00:15:34,but it was a tortoise ride. I've seen a photo of Rothschild on the back of a tortoise.
00:15:34,00:15:38,"Rothschild loved riding his tortoises. Yes, but if you went to the zoo, sorry."
00:15:38,00:15:44,"You wanted to just Walter Rothschild, who was a big old collector. Is that one knows who Rothschild is?"
00:15:44,00:15:49,"Or it might be that I couldn't remember his first name, so I just said his surname."
00:15:49,00:15:52,"But this is what you would do if you went to any zoo which had giant tortoises,"
00:15:52,00:15:56,then they would offer rides and it would either be just lots of children would climb on top.
00:15:56,00:15:59,Or they had little tortoise carriages and the tortoise would pull it.
00:15:59,00:16:04,"Okay, that is cute. I don't know why we stopped doing that."
00:16:04,00:16:07,"No, let's bring it back."
00:16:07,00:16:09,"What's an alligator slide, sorry."
00:16:09,00:16:15,"The alligator slide. No, it was said in this study that this was the most outrageous thing"
00:16:15,00:16:20,"that they made animals do, but basically it was making an alligator go up before me to high-ish ramp."
00:16:20,00:16:23,"And then sliding down a steep slide, which sounds to me incredibly fun."
00:16:23,00:16:27,"You wouldn't have to make me do that. You're not an alligator though, are you?"
00:16:27,00:16:31,"I'm not an alligator. Also, alligator rides were commonly offered."
00:16:31,00:16:35,There were lots of pictures of children. Children sitting on the backs of alligators.
00:16:35,00:16:36,It's not your most loved child though.
00:16:36,00:16:38,"I think it would be the least favourite. Yeah, number three."
00:16:38,00:16:44,"I guess if you lock the mouth shut, you're okay if you're not in water."
00:16:44,00:16:47,"You can hold the mouth shut with no force or with elastic band, you can hold it."
00:16:47,00:16:50,And that's what you'll say to child number three as you said in English.
00:16:50,00:16:53,"Come on, little Johnny, you're stronger than the elastic band, aren't you?"
00:16:53,00:16:56,What kind of pair of you? You see an elastic band over their mouth?
00:16:56,00:16:58,"You go, ""Yeah, it's all good, man. It's all good."""
00:16:59,00:17:03,"I can't say. In the pictures I saw in the mouth, it was hanging open."
00:17:03,00:17:06,"As it crumbled along with the child, but I'm sure that they're very well-trained."
00:17:06,00:17:11,"Just to say, the jaws of these animals like crocodiles and alligators and camons,"
00:17:11,00:17:14,"they're really strong for closing, they're really weak for opening."
00:17:14,00:17:19,"No, absolutely. That's the kind of ki-fact that, in real life, I'm not sure."
00:17:19,00:17:23,I'm willing to put my reputation on the line and my genitals.
00:17:25,00:17:29,"No, you have further alligator, a very good breakfast already, right? I think so."
00:17:29,00:17:32,It was either today or last week that he had breakfast. I'm sure he's still full.
00:17:32,00:17:36,Have you guys heard other unusual tortoises and turtles and things?
00:17:36,00:17:38,The African pancake tortoise.
00:17:38,00:17:43,"No, this is a great one. I'm going to say flat."
00:17:43,00:17:48,"It's flat. It's got a flat shell, but the cool thing about it is not only that,"
00:17:48,00:17:53,but it's that it can flip over very quickly when it lands on its back because it's so light.
00:17:53,00:17:56,"It's a bit like in robot wars, there's always one that can write itself."
00:17:56,00:17:57,Yeah.
00:17:57,00:17:59,And those are always the most dangerous robots of all.
00:17:59,00:18:01,But you're saying this can flip onto its back very quickly?
00:18:01,00:18:03,I can say it flips off its back.
00:18:03,00:18:05,It can write itself.
00:18:05,00:18:09,"So like the fingers with tortoises is at least in cartoons,"
00:18:09,00:18:12,"they end up on their back and they can't get back onto their feet, right?"
00:18:12,00:18:13,I think that is real.
00:18:13,00:18:18,I think it takes twice or three times as much energy for most of them to do that as it would to walk.
00:18:18,00:18:18,So that's great.
00:18:18,00:18:22,"Well, the African pancake one, though, it has a very light shell which means it can run"
00:18:22,00:18:24,much faster than your average tortoise.
00:18:24,00:18:26,But it's not got a big defense because it's got a very light shell.
00:18:26,00:18:31,"So when it's threatened, it just runs for cover and it runs under a rocky crevice"
00:18:31,00:18:34,and then breathes in like a puff of fish.
00:18:34,00:18:37,And it's impossible to pull it out because it's just wedged in there.
00:18:37,00:18:38,"Oh, so cool."
00:18:38,00:18:40,The rock becomes the shell.
00:18:40,00:18:41,"Yeah, wow."
00:18:41,00:18:42,"You've really got to find the perfect shape, rock."
00:18:42,00:18:45,I can imagine running to a huge pile of rocks is staring panic.
00:18:45,00:18:47,"So all of them, I can't get under that one."
00:18:47,00:18:47,That one's too big.
00:18:47,00:18:50,"That one's, ah, where's the rock that's made for me, but cool."
00:18:50,00:18:51,That's a really good point.
00:18:51,00:18:54,Do they sus out the local rocks ahead of them?
00:18:54,00:18:56,I don't have data.
00:18:56,00:18:59,We found the new books of tortoises with all the rock locations.
00:18:59,00:19:02,"Well, because they do an interesting thing whereby they'll often sleep"
00:19:02,00:19:04,in a bit where they know the sun is going to get to them in the morning.
00:19:04,00:19:07,"So this is not all species of tortoises, but a lot."
00:19:07,00:19:09,They can't dissipate the part of the sun.
00:19:09,00:19:09,"Yeah, quite clever."
00:19:09,00:19:10,So that's where they will sleep.
00:19:10,00:19:13,"So they know that when the sun hits in the morning, it warms them up and it gets them going."
00:19:13,00:19:15,They only have to have been there for the previous morning.
00:19:15,00:19:17,They've got good memories.
00:19:17,00:19:18,"Yeah, okay."
00:19:18,00:19:19,"It's not so, okay."
00:19:19,00:19:24,Unless they go to a new place on holiday and they just work out which way is east and west.
00:19:24,00:19:24,That's quite cool.
00:19:24,00:19:28,"Because I've failed to do that on holiday when parking the car, for example."
00:19:28,00:19:30,You park the higher car under the shade of the one tree.
00:19:30,00:19:32,"And you think, oh, that'll be right for four hours."
00:19:32,00:19:34,"Then you come back, same getting on a train."
00:19:34,00:19:37,"And you sit on one side of the train and you're like, oh, this will be beautiful."
00:19:37,00:19:38,And then suddenly you're in there.
00:19:38,00:19:39,You're in an oven.
00:19:39,00:19:40,You're in an oven.
00:19:40,00:19:42,"Well, that's because you're both warm-blooded creatures."
00:19:42,00:19:43,So you don't understand the necessity.
00:19:43,00:19:45,"If you were a tortoise, you would have died on that train."
00:19:45,00:19:47,And you would have died on that path.
00:19:47,00:19:49,So it's more important.
00:19:49,00:19:54,"Well, when the ticket collects, okay, my ran and hid between some perfectly sized suitcases."
00:19:54,00:19:57,The Galapagos silence tortoises.
00:19:57,00:20:00,"Very famous because of Darwin going there, finding them."
00:20:00,00:20:04,And they were also really endangered.
00:20:04,00:20:06,Partly because we ate them all.
00:20:06,00:20:07,So Darwin came across them.
00:20:07,00:20:08,They had delicious meat.
00:20:08,00:20:11,"Who rode them, too, didn't he?"
00:20:11,00:20:12,I think he did he ride them.
00:20:12,00:20:15,"Yeah, picture of him having a cheeky ride."
00:20:15,00:20:16,"Yeah, he was good."
00:20:16,00:20:18,If you're the one who's discovered them.
00:20:18,00:20:18,Yeah.
00:20:18,00:20:23,"And also, I think if you discover any species, you should be allowed to ride it."
00:20:23,00:20:25,"Yes, that's a good rule."
00:20:25,00:20:27,"I mean, incredibly fragile bats."
00:20:27,00:20:29,"No, I'm getting on that."
00:20:29,00:20:30,Settle it up.
00:20:30,00:20:34,"I think if you discover a new species, you get a little card."
00:20:34,00:20:36,And you can go to any zoo in the world.
00:20:36,00:20:39,"And you just pull it out and you go, ""I'm allowed to ride this."""
00:20:39,00:20:44,"The Lama is recovering from a serious lumbar region surgery, it doesn't matter."
00:20:46,00:20:48,"So yeah, they were big and delicious."
00:20:48,00:20:49,And they were endangered.
00:20:49,00:20:51,"And actually, on the island of Espanola,"
00:20:51,00:20:53,"there's a specific kind of giant tortoise,"
00:20:53,00:20:57,which was down to 14 in number in the 1970s.
00:20:57,00:20:57,Wow.
00:20:57,00:21:00,"But now, their numbers have really recovered."
00:21:00,00:21:02,"And there are over 3,000 because of breeding programs."
00:21:02,00:21:05,And the reason this is really important to conserve them.
00:21:05,00:21:08,One of the reasons is that they're extremely important for albatrosses.
00:21:08,00:21:11,Because they facilitate something about albatross lives.
00:21:11,00:21:13,What do you think of when you think albatrosses?
00:21:13,00:21:15,"I think of them at sea, bad luck."
00:21:15,00:21:17,"- Yeah. - In Japan. - Oh, no."
00:21:17,00:21:17,- In Japan. - In Japan.
00:21:17,00:21:18,- In Japan. - In Japan.
00:21:18,00:21:19,"- Crossbow. - Yes, yeah."
00:21:19,00:21:22,- And they fly for extremely long periods.
00:21:22,00:21:24,"- That's good. - Oh, big wingspanes."
00:21:24,00:21:26,"- Big, there we go."
00:21:26,00:21:27,"You can have your guest down, but we've got the rounds."
00:21:27,00:21:28,"- I think, I think."
00:21:28,00:21:30,"- It was a phrase in car games, a dead rubber."
00:21:30,00:21:33,"- Well, there's absolutely no consequence whatsoever."
00:21:33,00:21:35,- I wouldn't see that on university challenge
00:21:35,00:21:37,"where someone buzzes in, ""Bzzz."""
00:21:37,00:21:39,"Lord Byron, that's correct."
00:21:39,00:21:41,"- That goes, ""No, no, I can have another guest."""
00:21:41,00:21:42,"Sorry, Jeremy, just quickly."
00:21:42,00:21:45,- I think. - Yes.
00:21:45,00:21:48,"- That, quite often they need to crack things open."
00:21:48,00:21:51,And there's nothing that's really hard around.
00:21:51,00:21:54,"So, an albatross will fly over a giant tortoise,"
00:21:54,00:21:56,"drop the item, be it an egg or whatever."
00:21:56,00:21:58,It cracks open on their tortoise shell.
00:21:58,00:22:00,- Like a reverse escalus.
00:22:00,00:22:02,"- Yes, exactly. - Oh."
00:22:02,00:22:03,- Exactly. - That is correct.
00:22:03,00:22:05,That's actually how albatross has hatched their eggs
00:22:05,00:22:08,is they dropped more bags of tortoises.
00:22:08,00:22:11,- So escalus supposedly died when an eagle was carrying a tortoise
00:22:11,00:22:12,"and dropped it on his head,"
00:22:12,00:22:14,'cause thinking it was a rock.
00:22:14,00:22:16,"- Exactly, yeah, this is the opposite of that."
00:22:16,00:22:18,"- Is he right, Anna?"
00:22:18,00:22:19,- It's really more about Andy's answer
00:22:19,00:22:22,that they're very big windspans.
00:22:22,00:22:24,"Mean that, and the fact that they're very large anyway,"
00:22:24,00:22:27,they need a long runway to take off
00:22:27,00:22:29,"'cause they keep running and flapping, but like this one."
00:22:29,00:22:30,And they need to be very wide.
00:22:30,00:22:32,"And as soon as the tortoises went,"
00:22:32,00:22:35,what they do is they tramp up and down the mountains all day
00:22:35,00:22:38,and they tramp down the vegetation straight lines
00:22:38,00:22:40,"and they make these flawless, huge runways."
00:22:40,00:22:43,"And without them, the albatrosses can't take off."
00:22:43,00:22:45,So the albatrosses were all dying out as well.
00:22:45,00:22:47,- I don't think Andy got that right.
00:22:47,00:22:49,I think he just said wings and you filled in the rest.
00:22:49,00:22:53,"- It's a very big, and I was about to go on to say,"
00:22:53,00:22:55,exactly that about what they're creating.
00:22:55,00:22:56,"- Yeah, sorry."
00:22:56,00:22:58,If you're a cuckold in Northern China.
00:22:58,00:22:59,- Yeah.
00:22:59,00:23:01,(laughing)
00:23:01,00:23:03,- Big shout out to the cuckolds in Northern China.
00:23:03,00:23:05,"- I know, I know you guys are listening."
00:23:05,00:23:07,"You've got time on your hands, now she's gone."
00:23:07,00:23:11,"Your known as a tortoise, that term survives."
00:23:11,00:23:12,It's hundreds of years old term.
00:23:12,00:23:13,- Really?
00:23:13,00:23:14,- Yeah.
00:23:14,00:23:15,- Why is it?
00:23:15,00:23:17,- Is it about being too slow and so someone's whips
00:23:17,00:23:18,someone out from under your nose?
00:23:18,00:23:19,"- Oh, very good, but it's not right."
00:23:19,00:23:21,- I think it was getting going into your shell.
00:23:21,00:23:22,Something like that.
00:23:22,00:23:23,"- Yeah, that's it."
00:23:23,00:23:24,So they're associated.
00:23:24,00:23:25,- I'm not a psycho.
00:23:25,00:23:26,- I think I know.
00:23:26,00:23:30,"Basically, they're, I think they're associated with,"
00:23:30,00:23:33,I'm sorry to say a D2 messing penis.
00:23:33,00:23:37,And so it's all sort of shrinking down and going
00:23:37,00:23:39,soft and you're shirking danger as well.
00:23:39,00:23:40,So that's why.
00:23:40,00:23:42,- Thank god he didn't act that one out.
00:23:42,00:23:42,(laughing)
00:23:42,00:23:44,"- I am, Dan, I am."
00:23:44,00:23:46,You just can't see under the table.
00:23:46,00:23:48,- Can I say one thing about hinges?
00:23:48,00:23:49,"- Oh, okay, yeah."
00:23:49,00:23:51,- So there's a door in this room.
00:23:51,00:23:52,- Yeah.
00:23:52,00:23:52,- Yeah.
00:23:52,00:23:53,- It leads to the next room.
00:23:53,00:23:55,And there are three hinges on it.
00:23:55,00:23:57,What can you tell me about the spacing
00:23:57,00:23:59,of the top and bottom hinges?
00:23:59,00:24:01,"- The, the equidistant?"
00:24:01,00:24:02,"- Yeah, they seem, they seem--"
00:24:02,00:24:03,"- They seem it, don't they?"
00:24:03,00:24:05,"- Yeah, they seem the same as in the top of the bottom."
00:24:05,00:24:06,- Is the bottom one actually a bit closer
00:24:06,00:24:08,to the middle one compared to the top one?
00:24:08,00:24:10,"- Yeah, but the bottom one is further from the floor"
00:24:10,00:24:11,than the top one is from the top.
00:24:11,00:24:12,- Oh!
00:24:12,00:24:14,- And there's a few reasons for that.
00:24:14,00:24:16,"One of them is, it's an illusion."
00:24:16,00:24:17,- Yeah.
00:24:17,00:24:18,"- So to you, it looks about the same,"
00:24:18,00:24:19,but actually it's not the same.
00:24:19,00:24:21,And that's because of the foreshortening effects.
00:24:21,00:24:23,"So when things are slightly further away,"
00:24:23,00:24:25,distance looks different.
00:24:25,00:24:28,"And the other thing is, the top of your door,"
00:24:28,00:24:30,the hinge is holding more of the weight.
00:24:30,00:24:34,So the top one needs to be closer to the top.
00:24:34,00:24:35,- Close to the pivot.
00:24:35,00:24:35,- Closer to the pivot.
00:24:35,00:24:36,- Closer to the pivot weight.
00:24:36,00:24:37,"- Exactly, yeah."
00:24:37,00:24:38,- We can all agree the middle one
00:24:38,00:24:39,"is not pulling its weight there, right?"
00:24:39,00:24:40,(laughing)
00:24:40,00:24:41,- What's it he been doing?
00:24:41,00:24:42,- What's middle hinge doing?
00:24:42,00:24:45,- The middle one is there just because
00:24:45,00:24:47,three is a good number for the size of a door.
00:24:47,00:24:49,- I guess it helps with the illusion as well.
00:24:49,00:24:50,"- Yeah, it does."
00:24:50,00:24:51,- But the middle one is usually exactly in the middle.
00:24:51,00:24:52,- That's very good to know this.
00:24:52,00:24:54,So if you ever climb a step ladder
00:24:54,00:24:55,"and suddenly look at your door and think,"
00:24:55,00:24:57,"hang on, the hinges are all off."
00:24:57,00:24:59,And then you get down and think they're not again.
00:24:59,00:25:00,That's just the illusion.
00:25:00,00:25:01,- It might not just be the illusion
00:25:01,00:25:04,"if you're doing DIY, and it might be like,"
00:25:04,00:25:06,"and with this particular door, James."
00:25:06,00:25:07,- Yeah.
00:25:07,00:25:08,- The frame that's around this door
00:25:08,00:25:10,"is not on the bottom, but is on the top."
00:25:10,00:25:11,- Oh yeah.
00:25:11,00:25:13,- It's creating anything towards that illusion as well
00:25:13,00:25:15,that I'm adding in the frame.
00:25:15,00:25:16,- Can't hurt.
00:25:16,00:25:18,(laughing)
00:25:18,00:25:19,- If the frame is--
00:25:19,00:25:20,"- It's a little question of the night,"
00:25:20,00:25:22,"because this is, he wants to get home."
00:25:22,00:25:24,(laughing)
00:25:24,00:25:26,- And all questions don't go.
00:25:26,00:25:27,Bye.
00:25:27,00:25:29,(upbeat music)
00:25:29,00:25:34,"- Okay, and it's time for fact number three."
00:25:34,00:25:36,And that is Anna.
00:25:36,00:25:39,"- My fact this week is that after Frida Kahlo died,"
00:25:39,00:25:42,all her clothes and possessions spent 50 years
00:25:42,00:25:43,in a bathroom.
00:25:43,00:25:45,- Wow.
00:25:45,00:25:46,- Functioning bathroom?
00:25:46,00:25:48,"- People weren't going in and out using it, no."
00:25:48,00:25:50,"With no number ones, no number twos."
00:25:50,00:25:53,"- Big bathroom, 'cause presumably she had a lot of possessions."
00:25:53,00:25:55,"- She did have a hell of a lot of stuff in there,"
00:25:55,00:25:56,so because it must have been.
00:25:56,00:26:00,"So just to tell you how this happened,"
00:26:00,00:26:01,"it wasn't necessarily the plan,"
00:26:01,00:26:04,but Frida Kahlo died in 1954.
00:26:04,00:26:06,- She was a Mexican artist.
00:26:06,00:26:07,"- And yes, to go back one step further,"
00:26:07,00:26:09,she was a Mexican artist.
00:26:09,00:26:11,- Famously Mono Browd.
00:26:11,00:26:13,"- Famously Mono Browd, yes."
00:26:13,00:26:17,"- Imagine Oasis, but they're Mexican,"
00:26:17,00:26:19,"and instead of singing songs, they paint stuff."
00:26:19,00:26:20,- Yes.
00:26:20,00:26:24,"- And she did, she modeled herself on Oasis, actually."
00:26:24,00:26:25,So I think you've got the picture.
00:26:25,00:26:30,"She dies 1954, her husband, Diego Rivera,"
00:26:30,00:26:34,"shot all of her belongings in a bathroom in her house,"
00:26:34,00:26:36,which is called the Blue House in Mexico City.
00:26:36,00:26:38,"And it was a house where she'd been born,"
00:26:38,00:26:41,"where she'd grown up, and where she and Diego Rivera lived,"
00:26:41,00:26:42,and where she'd died.
00:26:42,00:26:44,"And he said, ""I want all of her possessions"
00:26:44,00:26:48,"""to be locked in here until 15 years after I die."""
00:26:48,00:26:48,- 15.
00:26:48,00:26:50,- 15.
00:26:50,00:26:51,I know a bit of a twist coming.
00:26:51,00:26:53,And we don't really know why.
00:26:53,00:26:56,"We think like out of sensitivity for her,"
00:26:56,00:26:58,"things that might be revealed,"
00:26:58,00:26:59,"and thought, you know, give it a bit of time,"
00:26:59,00:27:01,'cause there's all her letters and stuff.
00:27:01,00:27:03,"But basically, he entrusted this task"
00:27:03,00:27:05,"to a woman called Dolores Olmedo,"
00:27:05,00:27:07,"who was a huge fan of Diego Rivera,"
00:27:07,00:27:08,as all women sort of were.
00:27:08,00:27:10,He was obviously a compelling man.
00:27:10,00:27:12,So I think she probably fancied him
00:27:12,00:27:15,"and definitely adored him, didn't really like Frida."
00:27:15,00:27:17,And so she just never took him out.
00:27:17,00:27:19,"She just locked them in the bathroom,"
00:27:19,00:27:21,"waited, Diego Rivera died a few years later,"
00:27:21,00:27:22,and she just kept them in there.
00:27:22,00:27:24,- Of constipation.
00:27:24,00:27:26,(laughing)
00:27:26,00:27:28,'Cause the bathroom door was locked.
00:27:28,00:27:30,"- Indeed, no, but the rest of the house was full of shit,"
00:27:30,00:27:31,but the time you got there.
00:27:31,00:27:33,(laughing)
00:27:33,00:27:36,"And yeah, it was only in 2004,"
00:27:36,00:27:38,"after she died that someone said,"
00:27:38,00:27:39,"""Should we open that bathroom for the Frida color shit,"
00:27:39,00:27:40,"""see what's in there?"""
00:27:40,00:27:43,"And it's all her stuff, 22,000 documents,"
00:27:43,00:27:46,"300 items of clothing, 6,000 photos,"
00:27:46,00:27:48,"her prosthetic leg, her back brace."
00:27:48,00:27:49,"- Oh, wow."
00:27:49,00:27:51,- All of her makeup textiles.
00:27:51,00:27:53,- So why did she need the prosthetic leg
00:27:53,00:27:54,and her back brace?
00:27:54,00:27:55,"- Oh, yes."
00:27:55,00:27:57,"Well, this is all part of her great stories,"
00:27:57,00:27:59,"isn't it, of pain and injury?"
00:27:59,00:28:02,"- Well, she had a terrible, nearly fatal bus crash"
00:28:02,00:28:04,when she was 18.
00:28:04,00:28:05,She was involved in that.
00:28:05,00:28:08,She had already got polio as a girl.
00:28:08,00:28:10,She already had to wear a prosthesis
00:28:10,00:28:12,on her right leg due to the polio.
00:28:12,00:28:15,And then this bus crash completely wrecked her life.
00:28:15,00:28:18,"She broke her pelvis, her collarbone, her ribs, her back."
00:28:18,00:28:20,"Most of her life, she had to wear plaster corsets"
00:28:20,00:28:21,to support her.
00:28:21,00:28:24,"And so much of this, as Anna says, made its way in her art."
00:28:24,00:28:26,- Frequently about pain.
00:28:26,00:28:27,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:28:27,00:28:27,"- I mean, it's frequently just this,"
00:28:27,00:28:29,she's got this really badly broken body
00:28:29,00:28:30,for the back bone.
00:28:30,00:28:32,"- She also painted her casts quite a lot, didn't she?"
00:28:32,00:28:32,- Yeah.
00:28:32,00:28:35,- Kind of some of the first paintings she did was on her casts.
00:28:35,00:28:39,"And she even painted the bus that hit her on her cast,"
00:28:39,00:28:40,which I think is pretty badass.
00:28:40,00:28:42,- We should talk a bit about this crash
00:28:42,00:28:44,'cause it was an extreme crash.
00:28:44,00:28:45,She was with her boyfriend.
00:28:45,00:28:48,"She was about 18, it was 1925."
00:28:48,00:28:52,And basically a tram plowed very slowly into their bus.
00:28:52,00:28:54,And the boyfriend remembers his knees
00:28:54,00:28:55,were suddenly touching the knees
00:28:55,00:28:58,of the people sitting on the bench opposite as it bent.
00:28:58,00:29:00,And then the whole vehicle splintered
00:29:00,00:29:01,into a million pieces.
00:29:01,00:29:04,And as well as all those horrendous breakages
00:29:04,00:29:05,were the worst thing that happened
00:29:05,00:29:08,was she got impaled on a steel handrail
00:29:08,00:29:10,that went straight through her abdomen.
00:29:10,00:29:13,And she didn't realize at the time
00:29:13,00:29:14,the extent of her injuries.
00:29:14,00:29:16,"It's like, I guess you don't in the shock of the moment."
00:29:16,00:29:17,"She said, ""The first thing I thought of"
00:29:17,00:29:20,"was this Mexican toy that I just got."""
00:29:20,00:29:21,"And I thought, ""Oh, no, where is it?"""
00:29:21,00:29:22,I've lost it in the wreckage.
00:29:22,00:29:23,"- Yeah, right."
00:29:23,00:29:24,"- And her boyfriend looked at him and was like,"
00:29:24,00:29:27,"""Yeah, you're also impaled on a large metal spike."""
00:29:27,00:29:29,And they had to pull it out.
00:29:29,00:29:31,"- Oh, God, and also there are the mad details"
00:29:31,00:29:33,"that she's covered in blood, obviously."
00:29:33,00:29:35,"But then someone, who they speculated"
00:29:35,00:29:36,"was probably a house painter,"
00:29:36,00:29:41,"was carrying a big box of gold paint, sparkly gold paint."
00:29:41,00:29:42,And that sort of flew through the air
00:29:42,00:29:44,and landed all over her as well.
00:29:44,00:29:45,- Oh my God.
00:29:45,00:29:46,- So she was covered in blood
00:29:46,00:29:47,with all these gold sprinkles all over her.
00:29:47,00:29:49,- And then a piano that was being lifted
00:29:49,00:29:50,into a building dropped on top of her.
00:29:50,00:29:52,"- Yeah, so every laurel in heart."
00:29:52,00:29:53,- It is absolutely extraordinary.
00:29:53,00:29:56,"It's just really, really kind of broccoli awful."
00:29:56,00:29:59,So she started painting partly in recovery
00:29:59,00:30:00,from this.
00:30:00,00:30:02,And she's an amazing artist.
00:30:02,00:30:05,I didn't really know much of her work before this.
00:30:05,00:30:07,And like frequently self-portraits
00:30:07,00:30:09,"and self-portraits throughout her life, you know?"
00:30:09,00:30:11,"And then she met Diego Rivera,"
00:30:11,00:30:13,who was a mural painter.
00:30:13,00:30:14,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:30:14,00:30:15,Incredibly famous.
00:30:15,00:30:16,- Incredibly famous.
00:30:16,00:30:19,"- Much older than her, like 20 years of senior."
00:30:19,00:30:20,- Yeah. - Twice her age.
00:30:20,00:30:21,- Twice her age.
00:30:21,00:30:22,She'd been married twice before.
00:30:22,00:30:24,His doctor had told him he was unfit for monogamy
00:30:24,00:30:25,as a diagnosis.
00:30:25,00:30:26,- Is he?
00:30:26,00:30:28,(laughing)
00:30:28,00:30:29,"- Oh, you look like you're out with the doctor"
00:30:29,00:30:31,when you book that GP appointment.
00:30:31,00:30:33,- I just know that when you book a doctor's appointment
00:30:33,00:30:35,"in the UK, I don't know if it's for everyone,"
00:30:35,00:30:36,but I have to go on a website
00:30:36,00:30:39,and I have to click all the things that are wrong with me.
00:30:39,00:30:39,- Me too.
00:30:39,00:30:43,- And monogamy has never been one of the checkmasters.
00:30:43,00:30:45,"- Did he have that as like, you know, if he got caught,"
00:30:45,00:30:47,he would show that note to his partner.
00:30:47,00:30:50,"And just saying, I think he did get caught a lot."
00:30:50,00:30:51,"I mean, he had so many affairs."
00:30:51,00:30:52,"- Yeah, so did she."
00:30:52,00:30:53,- Yeah.
00:30:53,00:30:55,"- Well, she made a tortoise out of him."
00:30:55,00:30:57,I'll tell you that much.
00:30:57,00:30:59,But he also made a tortoise out of her a lot.
00:30:59,00:31:00,- So what's the making the tortoise?
00:31:00,00:31:02,"- We're in Northern China, I know."
00:31:02,00:31:04,"- Sorry, I forgot that bit."
00:31:04,00:31:06,- Her sister he hadn't affair with?
00:31:06,00:31:07,- Yeah.
00:31:07,00:31:08,"- God's sake, Diego."
00:31:08,00:31:10,"- Well, they had a very interesting setup though."
00:31:10,00:31:12,"When they moved into their marital house,"
00:31:12,00:31:16,"weirdly, it was two houses connected by a rooftop bridge."
00:31:16,00:31:18,And so he had his studio in one of them.
00:31:18,00:31:20,"She had her studio in the other,"
00:31:20,00:31:22,but they just had their own pads
00:31:22,00:31:25,for sleeping with him models and assistants
00:31:25,00:31:29,and her with just men and women that she fancied.
00:31:29,00:31:30,- And Leon Trotsky.
00:31:30,00:31:31,- And Leon Trotsky.
00:31:31,00:31:32,"- Right, the twist."
00:31:32,00:31:34,- What a cameo.
00:31:34,00:31:37,- Extraordinary.
00:31:37,00:31:38,- I can't get over the Trotsky thing.
00:31:38,00:31:40,I can't get over the fact that she hadn't affair
00:31:40,00:31:42,with Leon Trotsky.
00:31:42,00:31:43,"When he was, you know, he'd fled."
00:31:43,00:31:44,"He'd been kicked out of Russia, hadn't he,"
00:31:44,00:31:45,after the revolution.
00:31:45,00:31:46,- So he was like a revolutionary
00:31:46,00:31:48,"who fell out with Stalin, basically."
00:31:48,00:31:50,- That was not the thing to do in the thirties.
00:31:50,00:31:51,- Oh no.
00:31:51,00:31:51,"- No, no, no, no."
00:31:51,00:31:53,"- All the people in the world to fall out with,"
00:31:53,00:31:54,he was one of the worst.
00:31:54,00:31:56,"- Absolutely, absolutely."
00:31:56,00:31:57,"- And he needed someone to go, didn't he,"
00:31:57,00:31:58,that we're safe.
00:31:58,00:32:00,And actually it was Diego.
00:32:00,00:32:01,- I'd done it.
00:32:01,00:32:03,"- Spoiler, he was assassinated a few years later"
00:32:03,00:32:04,by one of Stalin's henchmen.
00:32:04,00:32:05,- Sure.
00:32:05,00:32:06,- So he didn't find that place in the end.
00:32:06,00:32:07,- No.
00:32:07,00:32:09,- But he did meet Diego and Frieda
00:32:09,00:32:11,and they banged the Mexican president
00:32:11,00:32:13,to let him into the country and his house him.
00:32:13,00:32:15,"So the president said, okay, we'll house him"
00:32:15,00:32:18,and then they kept him in that house for two years
00:32:18,00:32:20,and their affair was very short.
00:32:20,00:32:22,It was just at the start in 1937.
00:32:22,00:32:23,- He was also very done.
00:32:23,00:32:24,"- Yes, and he was very--"
00:32:24,00:32:26,"- He was married, Mrs. Trotsky was around."
00:32:26,00:32:27,Mrs. Trotsky is a funny name.
00:32:27,00:32:29,"I just think that's a funny, you don't think of,"
00:32:29,00:32:31,"and is there a Mrs. Trotsky, you know?"
00:32:31,00:32:32,- It sounds like a little piglet.
00:32:32,00:32:35,- A pig mind a character.
00:32:35,00:32:38,(all laughing)
00:32:38,00:32:40,"But some of their meetings,"
00:32:40,00:32:43,"Frieda's and Leon Trotsky's, they took place"
00:32:43,00:32:45,at the house of the very sister
00:32:45,00:32:48,"who had slept with Frieda's husband, Diego."
00:32:48,00:32:49,- Right.
00:32:49,00:32:50,"- Oh, it's messy."
00:32:50,00:32:52,"- His death was wild as well, Trotsky's."
00:32:52,00:32:53,- Trotsky's?
00:32:53,00:32:55,"- Because he was killed with a nice pig,"
00:32:55,00:32:57,"and the guy was a mountaineer who did it,"
00:32:57,00:32:59,"so he knew how to swing one,"
00:32:59,00:33:01,and he thought I could probably get it in two goes.
00:33:01,00:33:01,"He didn't want to fire a gun,"
00:33:01,00:33:03,because he didn't want to raise noise.
00:33:03,00:33:04,He needed to escape from this compound
00:33:04,00:33:06,that Trotsky was staying in.
00:33:06,00:33:07,"So, but he did it, it went into his skull,"
00:33:07,00:33:09,but not deep enough to kill him.
00:33:09,00:33:10,"So Trotsky was running around,"
00:33:10,00:33:12,"going, there's a nice pig in my head."
00:33:12,00:33:13,Can we talk about the brows?
00:33:13,00:33:14,- A famous brow.
00:33:14,00:33:15,- The bruise.
00:33:15,00:33:17,"- Oh, okay, her brows, her brow."
00:33:17,00:33:19,"She emphasized that, didn't she?"
00:33:19,00:33:20,- Yeah.
00:33:20,00:33:21,"- She painted it on, she made it up."
00:33:21,00:33:24,She emphasized her moustache as well.
00:33:24,00:33:26,"She had a tiny little bit of moustache-ness,"
00:33:26,00:33:28,but she really emphasized it to make herself seem
00:33:28,00:33:30,"strong, basically, at masculine."
00:33:30,00:33:31,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:33:31,00:33:33,"- She did really like that sort of,"
00:33:33,00:33:36,"she really did push her brands, didn't she?"
00:33:36,00:33:39,"Like, she claimed that she was born on a day"
00:33:39,00:33:40,"that she wasn't born at,"
00:33:40,00:33:43,'cause it was the same year as the Mexican Revolution.
00:33:43,00:33:44,- Oh really?
00:33:44,00:33:45,"- Yeah, I mean, three years apart."
00:33:45,00:33:47,It wasn't like she claimed she was born the next week.
00:33:47,00:33:49,She killed her three years later.
00:33:49,00:33:50,- Wow.
00:33:50,00:33:52,"- Coincidence, it makes her three years younger."
00:33:52,00:33:54,"- But then, of course, like, it's still the case now."
00:33:54,00:33:55,"We're like, Frida Kahlo."
00:33:55,00:33:58,If you look at all the kind of art books
00:33:58,00:34:00,that my daughter's got three years old
00:34:00,00:34:02,of all got Frida Kahlo in.
00:34:02,00:34:04,"'Cause she's just such a brand, isn't she?"
00:34:04,00:34:06,- She invented an aesthetic that genuinely
00:34:06,00:34:07,think my three year old
00:34:07,00:34:09,would be able to recognize Frida Kahlo.
00:34:09,00:34:09,"- Yeah, right."
00:34:09,00:34:10,- For sure.
00:34:10,00:34:11,"- Well, they did a Barbie of her as well."
00:34:11,00:34:12,- Yeah.
00:34:12,00:34:13,- And the Barbie got banned in Mexico
00:34:13,00:34:16,"because weirdly, they took away the monobrow"
00:34:16,00:34:18,"as part of the look, this iconic look."
00:34:18,00:34:20,They made her incredibly slim.
00:34:20,00:34:22,"So the family, basically."
00:34:22,00:34:23,"- Yeah, it wasn't the government banned there."
00:34:23,00:34:24,- Yeah.
00:34:24,00:34:27,- There was a lawsuit because they didn't want this
00:34:27,00:34:29,to be sold in Mexico and they pulled off the shelves.
00:34:29,00:34:30,- Yeah.
00:34:30,00:34:31,- But it wasn't.
00:34:31,00:34:32,- You wouldn't not have a monobrow out of the Barbie.
00:34:32,00:34:33,- Yeah.
00:34:33,00:34:34,- The most famous thing about her.
00:34:34,00:34:35,"It's extraordinary, isn't it?"
00:34:35,00:34:38,"- And so Andy, as you said, she did paint herself a lot."
00:34:38,00:34:42,"So apparently, in total, it's 143 paintings."
00:34:42,00:34:45,55 of which were self portraits.
00:34:45,00:34:47,And they're very surrealistic.
00:34:47,00:34:50,I didn't realize she was as surreal as she was.
00:34:50,00:34:52,"There's one, which is called my birth,"
00:34:52,00:34:54,where she's giving birth to herself.
00:34:54,00:34:58,So you see her head coming out of her own vagina.
00:34:58,00:35:00,You don't see that it's her because there's a sheet
00:35:00,00:35:02,over the head of the person giving birth.
00:35:02,00:35:05,"But through notes that she left in her diary and so on,"
00:35:05,00:35:09,we know that that was her being represented underneath the sheet.
00:35:09,00:35:11,Now that is owned by Madonna.
00:35:11,00:35:15,We know that Madonna owns roughly five self portraits
00:35:15,00:35:18,"by Frida Kahlo, two of which we know the names of that one."
00:35:18,00:35:19,And then there's another one where there's a monkey
00:35:19,00:35:21,on the side of her arm.
00:35:21,00:35:22,- And Madonna got that one.
00:35:22,00:35:23,"- Yeah, Madonna's got that."
00:35:23,00:35:24,Yeah.
00:35:24,00:35:25,And Madonna has been quoted in Vanity Fair
00:35:25,00:35:28,"saying when she brings people over who are new people in her life,"
00:35:28,00:35:30,she'll show them the my birth one.
00:35:30,00:35:32,"And if they don't like it, she'll know"
00:35:32,00:35:33,that they're not going to be a long-term friend.
00:35:33,00:35:35,- I feel really sad about that.
00:35:35,00:35:36,- About what?
00:35:36,00:35:38,- That I'm never going to be friends with Madonna.
00:35:38,00:35:39,(laughing)
00:35:39,00:35:40,- Do you know why?
00:35:40,00:35:43,"- I do like lots of Frida Kahlo stuff, but that, honestly,"
00:35:43,00:35:44,it's a bit much for me.
00:35:44,00:35:45,"- For me, right."
00:35:45,00:35:48,"- But my question is, would you really be honest about that?"
00:35:48,00:35:51,"- If Madonna asks, I think no one's saying to Madonna to her face."
00:35:51,00:35:52,I don't like your painting.
00:35:52,00:35:53,- Yeah.
00:35:53,00:35:54,"- I think she's like, well, everyone's my friend."
00:35:54,00:35:58,"James is actually the only person I know who might just say,"
00:35:58,00:35:58,I really hate that.
00:35:58,00:35:59,- You know what?
00:35:59,00:36:00,- You should take it down.
00:36:00,00:36:02,"- Actually, I didn't really care for like a virgin."
00:36:02,00:36:03,(laughing)
00:36:03,00:36:05,"- Ouch, okay, well, we can't be friends now."
00:36:05,00:36:06,(laughing)
00:36:06,00:36:08,(upbeat music)
00:36:08,00:36:12,"- Okay, it is time for a final factor of the show."
00:36:12,00:36:14,And that is James.
00:36:14,00:36:16,- My fact this week is that actor Noel Gubiemi
00:36:16,00:36:19,played Hector in the Fast and the Furious.
00:36:19,00:36:22,"Since then, he has played a character called Hector"
00:36:22,00:36:24,in 30 other projects.
00:36:24,00:36:27,"And now, if he's in a movie where he's not called Hector,"
00:36:27,00:36:30,he'll try to change the character's name to Hector.
00:36:30,00:36:32,- Yeah.
00:36:32,00:36:32,- What?
00:36:32,00:36:35,"- He's, is he confused about acting?"
00:36:35,00:36:35,"What, acting?"
00:36:35,00:36:37,- He's found his niche.
00:36:37,00:36:39,"- Yeah, he's a Hector."
00:36:39,00:36:42,"- So basically, this is something I saw in an interview"
00:36:42,00:36:45,with Los Angeles Radio Station.
00:36:45,00:36:47,"And apparently, started as a coincidence."
00:36:47,00:36:50,So the writers just were looking for a Hispanic name.
00:36:50,00:36:53,And they would often just come up with Hector or Carlos
00:36:53,00:36:56,"because it's like not the most obvious,"
00:36:56,00:36:58,but it's like one of the most obvious.
00:36:58,00:36:59,- Interesting.
00:36:59,00:37:02,"I didn't, so it's like not calling your English character John,"
00:37:02,00:37:04,it's calling him Michael.
00:37:04,00:37:05,Do you know what I mean?
00:37:05,00:37:06,"- Yeah, 'cause I used to just get Hector"
00:37:06,00:37:07,just with the Trojan War.
00:37:07,00:37:08,- Yeah.
00:37:08,00:37:10,- And I can think of it in a Hispanic sense.
00:37:10,00:37:13,"- Well, it is kind of a popular Hispanic name."
00:37:13,00:37:16,"- So in Puerto Rico right now, Hector is the 18th most"
00:37:16,00:37:20,"popular name, which is beaten by Michael Kevin and Brian."
00:37:20,00:37:22,"But in the '80s and '90s and early 2000s,"
00:37:22,00:37:23,it was very popular.
00:37:23,00:37:26,"So these characters, this guy is in his 30s."
00:37:26,00:37:29,"So his character, people of that age were called Hector"
00:37:29,00:37:32,quite a lot in the Hispanic speaking world.
00:37:32,00:37:34,"And so yeah, it started as a coincidence."
00:37:34,00:37:37,And then it was noted in an Instagram post
00:37:37,00:37:39,and it went a bit viral and he sort of ran with it.
00:37:39,00:37:42,"And now sometimes in a movie, he'll get a choice"
00:37:42,00:37:45,to chase a name or keep it.
00:37:45,00:37:47,"And if he has the chance, he'll always say,"
00:37:47,00:37:48,"""Now I want to be Hector."""
00:37:48,00:37:51,"- Well, he's got a hell of a list of movies he's done."
00:37:51,00:37:52,He's been in so many movies.
00:37:52,00:37:54,So Hector's not even the only recurring name
00:37:54,00:37:56,that has come up in his movies.
00:37:56,00:37:58,So he's played Jose four times.
00:37:58,00:38:00,He's played Cruz twice.
00:38:00,00:38:03,- So I would say Jose is the straight up
00:38:03,00:38:06,"first Hispanic name you would go to, right?"
00:38:06,00:38:07,"- Yeah, okay."
00:38:07,00:38:08,- No way.
00:38:08,00:38:09,(laughing)
00:38:09,00:38:10,- Just put it in anywhere.
00:38:10,00:38:11,(laughing)
00:38:11,00:38:12,"- Well, how about this one then?"
00:38:12,00:38:15,"Twice, he's played someone called Gang Banger One."
00:38:15,00:38:16,(laughing)
00:38:16,00:38:20,"Again, that's the 19th most popular name in Florida right now."
00:38:20,00:38:23,- This is not an unrelated film.
00:38:23,00:38:25,(laughing)
00:38:25,00:38:26,- He completely is.
00:38:26,00:38:27,- No.
00:38:27,00:38:28,"- So when he did it, Gang Banger One,"
00:38:28,00:38:30,he's listed in the X-Files.
00:38:30,00:38:32,"- And that's just a gang member, we should say."
00:38:32,00:38:34,It's just someone who's in gang fights a lot.
00:38:34,00:38:35,"- Oh, is it?"
00:38:35,00:38:36,"- Oh, grow up guys."
00:38:36,00:38:37,- What?
00:38:37,00:38:38,- I've never heard of that.
00:38:38,00:38:38,- I've never heard of that.
00:38:38,00:38:41,"- He's a Gang Banger, is very common."
00:38:41,00:38:44,"Come to South London, you'll hear it said."
00:38:44,00:38:45,It's someone who's in a gang.
00:38:45,00:38:46,It's someone who gets him gang fights.
00:38:46,00:38:47,- Are you sure?
00:38:47,00:38:48,- Who plays the drum in the gang?
00:38:48,00:38:50,"- No, just anyone."
00:38:50,00:38:51,"- Any gang, yeah."
00:38:51,00:38:52,- Are you sure?
00:38:52,00:38:53,- I'm positive.
00:38:53,00:38:56,"I remember from my time in the Peckham crew, all right?"
00:38:56,00:38:58,(laughing)
00:38:58,00:39:00,- I remember from my time in the Orgy.
00:39:00,00:39:01,(laughing)
00:39:01,00:39:02,We all had a different understanding.
00:39:02,00:39:04,"- So yeah, it's an old fashioned term."
00:39:04,00:39:06,It's not as much used these days out.
00:39:06,00:39:07,- That's right.
00:39:07,00:39:10,"- Because I would say probably, my memory of the X-Files"
00:39:10,00:39:14,is there would be more likely to be gangs than...
00:39:14,00:39:15,- The bags.
00:39:15,00:39:16,- The bags.
00:39:16,00:39:17,- Yeah.
00:39:17,00:39:19,"Well, the other time was in a movie called Out of Sight,"
00:39:19,00:39:21,"which is listed on his Wikipedia,"
00:39:21,00:39:23,"but not listed on IMDB,"
00:39:23,00:39:25,and I didn't have time to watch the movie.
00:39:25,00:39:26,"- Wait, not out of sight with George Clooney and..."
00:39:26,00:39:27,- And Jennifer Lopez.
00:39:27,00:39:28,- And Jennifer Lopez.
00:39:28,00:39:29,- And I'm amazingly bad film.
00:39:29,00:39:31,"- Well, yeah, he's had so many roles."
00:39:31,00:39:32,"He's been called Snuffy, Chicken,"
00:39:32,00:39:34,"Lord of the Garbage, Subway Guy,"
00:39:34,00:39:36,"Sam the Man, Random,"
00:39:36,00:39:39,why didn't he demand to always be called Lord of the Garbage?
00:39:39,00:39:41,(laughing)
00:39:41,00:39:44,- That's a Michael flatly dance that I didn't really want to see.
00:39:44,00:39:45,(laughing)
00:39:45,00:39:46,"- Latin Guy on a bicycle,"
00:39:46,00:39:48,and that was in the video clip
00:39:48,00:39:49,for Pretty Fly For A White Guy.
00:39:49,00:39:50,The offspring is in that.
00:39:50,00:39:51,- It's in that.
00:39:51,00:39:52,- He's in that.
00:39:52,00:39:54,"- Yeah, very good."
00:39:54,00:39:55,"- Character names are funny, are they?"
00:39:55,00:39:56,- Kambi.
00:39:56,00:39:59,"- Often, they express something about the character."
00:39:59,00:40:01,"- Yeah, like some writers will,"
00:40:01,00:40:02,"as soon as you see a character's name,"
00:40:02,00:40:04,you'll know exactly what they do.
00:40:04,00:40:06,"Like Dickens, for instance, called JK Rowling."
00:40:06,00:40:07,- Exactly.
00:40:07,00:40:08,"- But then other ones,"
00:40:08,00:40:10,"they would just call themselves Jack Reacher,"
00:40:10,00:40:11,and you don't know what that is.
00:40:11,00:40:13,It's just a person called Jack.
00:40:13,00:40:13,- Exactly.
00:40:13,00:40:15,"And so the Dickens character's,"
00:40:15,00:40:16,"and they're called Crathillic Names,"
00:40:16,00:40:17,which I didn't know.
00:40:17,00:40:20,They dates back to Platonic Dialogue.
00:40:20,00:40:21,"So there's a Platonic Dialogue,"
00:40:21,00:40:22,"which is all about,"
00:40:22,00:40:24,is your name relevant to your character.
00:40:24,00:40:26,"And so when Dickens has Mr. Bumble,"
00:40:26,00:40:28,"or Mr. Murd Stone,"
00:40:28,00:40:29,"who's a tough, hard character,"
00:40:29,00:40:30,that just...
00:40:30,00:40:32,"- Who's the Mr. Chokam,"
00:40:32,00:40:34,something in... - Chokam Child.
00:40:34,00:40:35,- Chokam Child.
00:40:35,00:40:36,- Yeah.
00:40:36,00:40:37,- That's a really rubbish one.
00:40:37,00:40:40,But so there's this story about Dickens
00:40:40,00:40:42,that Tiny Tim was allegedly going to be called
00:40:42,00:40:44,Puny Pete at one point.
00:40:44,00:40:46,"And it's, I have been trying to nail this"
00:40:46,00:40:48,because I don't think it's actually true.
00:40:48,00:40:52,"Like there's this piece from Dickens Quarterly in 1995,"
00:40:52,00:40:54,"which says actually this might be from an advert,"
00:40:54,00:40:56,"'cause there was an advert which said,"
00:40:56,00:40:58,"little Larry, small Sam, Puny Pete,"
00:40:58,00:40:58,"they were all crossed out,"
00:40:58,00:41:00,and then below it it says Tiny Tim.
00:41:00,00:41:01,- Not crossed out.
00:41:01,00:41:02,- Not crossed out.
00:41:02,00:41:03,"And it's saying like, sometimes you have to iterate"
00:41:03,00:41:05,and go through a few versions
00:41:05,00:41:05,before you get the final thing.
00:41:05,00:41:06,"So that might be,"
00:41:06,00:41:07,that's a common internet factoid
00:41:07,00:41:09,that actually might not be.
00:41:09,00:41:10,- It's one of my favourite things we do
00:41:10,00:41:11,is explode misconceptions
00:41:11,00:41:13,that only two people had.
00:41:13,00:41:16,Those two people will be listeners.
00:41:16,00:41:16,So it's good.
00:41:16,00:41:22,"- This guy, Hector, arguably is Typecast."
00:41:22,00:41:26,He's doing quite similar characters in all these things.
00:41:26,00:41:31,IMDB has a category of the most Typecast actors in the world
00:41:31,00:41:34,and it explains the kind of character that they do.
00:41:34,00:41:38,So I want to do a quiz where I'll give you the explanation
00:41:38,00:41:40,of the character and you have to say the name of the actor
00:41:40,00:41:42,that they're describing.
00:41:42,00:41:44,So easy one to start off with.
00:41:44,00:41:46,"Neurotic, sex-obsessed, intellectual."
00:41:46,00:41:47,- Woody Allen.
00:41:47,00:41:49,- Straight in there.
00:41:49,00:41:51,If at home you got that quicker than Dan and Andy Weldon.
00:41:51,00:41:56,"Greasy, weasily, slightly mental creep."
00:41:56,00:41:57,"- That's Dan, isn't it?"
00:41:57,00:42:00,"That's, he didn't do much acting."
00:42:00,00:42:01,- I've got that one credit.
00:42:01,00:42:02,Gang banger too.
00:42:02,00:42:07,- Alan Whitman?
00:42:07,00:42:09,"- No, Greasy Weasily, slightly mental creep."
00:42:09,00:42:11,"- And when I tell you, you'll go, oh yeah."
00:42:11,00:42:13,"- Okay, hang on a sec."
00:42:13,00:42:16,"- Oh, no, I can picture him on my head, stupid Chevy."
00:42:16,00:42:17,"- Correct, that's who I was going for as well."
00:42:17,00:42:19,"- Yes, okay, well done, Andy and me."
00:42:19,00:42:25,- Offbeat quirky hipster who's a little stuck
00:42:25,00:42:26,in Dreamland.
00:42:26,00:42:27,- Michael Sarah?
00:42:27,00:42:29,"- No, it's."
00:42:29,00:42:30,"- Ah, that annoying woman."
00:42:30,00:42:31,- Yeah.
00:42:31,00:42:32,God.
00:42:32,00:42:34,- I need to pick the mom in Paddington.
00:42:34,00:42:35,- I mean Sally Hawkins.
00:42:35,00:42:36,- Sally Hawkins.
00:42:36,00:42:37,"- Oh, no, it's not her."
00:42:37,00:42:38,- Is it a woman?
00:42:38,00:42:39,- It's a woman.
00:42:39,00:42:41,"- Offbeat, say it again."
00:42:41,00:42:43,- Offbeat quirky hipster who's a little stuck in Dreamland.
00:42:43,00:42:44,I'll tell you this one.
00:42:44,00:42:45,- Is it Woody Deschanel?
00:42:45,00:42:46,- It's correct.
00:42:46,00:42:47,- Yes.
00:42:47,00:42:48,- I don't know what that is.
00:42:48,00:42:50,- A tough woman who eventually shows vulnerability
00:42:50,00:42:53,by breaking down in a crying scene.
00:42:53,00:42:54,- Sigourney Weaver?
00:42:54,00:42:55,- She doesn't break down in crying scenes.
00:42:55,00:42:56,- She breaks others.
00:42:56,00:42:58,- Mell Street.
00:42:58,00:42:59,- Who's he saying?
00:42:59,00:42:59,- Mell Street.
00:42:59,00:43:00,- Mell Street.
00:43:00,00:43:02,"- No, we're kind of getting there."
00:43:02,00:43:03,- Julia Roberts.
00:43:03,00:43:03,- Correct.
00:43:03,00:43:04,- Oh.
00:43:04,00:43:06,- He's back in the game.
00:43:06,00:43:07,- Is she a tough woman?
00:43:07,00:43:08,- Yeah.
00:43:08,00:43:09,- Okay.
00:43:09,00:43:11,"- Finally in this quiz, immature man child."
00:43:11,00:43:12,- Adam Sandler.
00:43:12,00:43:13,- Correct.
00:43:13,00:43:16,(all laughing)
00:43:16,00:43:17,- It's good.
00:43:17,00:43:18,"- Oh, sorry guys."
00:43:18,00:43:19,- That's quite striking.
00:43:19,00:43:19,"- No, it's very good."
00:43:19,00:43:21,"- Oh, clearly they come across."
00:43:21,00:43:24,- So the tight casting is so dangerous for actors.
00:43:24,00:43:26,- There's an ed O'Neill.
00:43:26,00:43:28,There used to be a sitcom married with children.
00:43:28,00:43:29,"If you can't picture him from that,"
00:43:29,00:43:32,"he was in that, he's in modern family as well"
00:43:32,00:43:34,as one of the husbands in it.
00:43:34,00:43:37,- It was like a long suffering husband.
00:43:37,00:43:39,"- Yeah, incredibly funny to the point"
00:43:39,00:43:41,where he almost just had to shrug and people would laugh.
00:43:41,00:43:44,"And so he was in a movie called Flight of the Intruder,"
00:43:44,00:43:46,"Drama Movie, 1991 it came out."
00:43:46,00:43:48,Test audiences kept on laughing.
00:43:48,00:43:50,Anytime he came on screen or did any movement
00:43:50,00:43:52,that he was just cut from the film.
00:43:52,00:43:53,- Wow.
00:43:53,00:43:54,"- They were like, you're ruining the film."
00:43:54,00:43:55,You're too funny.
00:43:55,00:43:56,You're too funny at the moment.
00:43:56,00:43:57,- That's tough.
00:43:57,00:43:58,- That's the tight casting.
00:43:58,00:43:59,"It isn't real thing, isn't it?"
00:43:59,00:44:02,So there's an actor called Mikael Gillavani
00:44:02,00:44:06,who played Stalin in 12 different films
00:44:06,00:44:08,made during Stalin's lifetime.
00:44:08,00:44:10,And then the work did dry up.
00:44:10,00:44:12,(all laughing)
00:44:12,00:44:14,- Why are we gonna get a job now at Leaves
00:44:14,00:44:15,in the right country?
00:44:15,00:44:16,"- Yeah, I read about him."
00:44:16,00:44:20,He basically played Stalin in one movie
00:44:20,00:44:22,"and Stalin really, really liked him"
00:44:22,00:44:25,because he was by far the most handsome and tallest
00:44:25,00:44:27,member of the cast and he was playing Stalin.
00:44:27,00:44:30,"And Stalin was like, that's exactly who should be playing me."
00:44:30,00:44:32,"And then from then on, yeah,"
00:44:32,00:44:34,"he was like, this guy is gonna play me all the time."
00:44:34,00:44:36,And obviously there were quite a few movies
00:44:36,00:44:37,about Stalin made.
00:44:37,00:44:38,- Yes.
00:44:38,00:44:39,"- And when the casting call comes in,"
00:44:39,00:44:41,"it must be a tricky, like, do you wanna take this job?"
00:44:41,00:44:42,- It is time casting me.
00:44:42,00:44:44,- But I'll be killed if I don't do it.
00:44:44,00:44:47,"- But yeah, then after Chris Chev did that speech"
00:44:47,00:44:49,"that said to Stalin was a wanker, then no more."
00:44:49,00:44:53,"- No, James Doohan had a horrible one."
00:44:53,00:44:56,James Doohan was scotty in Star Trek.
00:44:56,00:44:58,So he was the guy who would fix things.
00:44:58,00:45:00,He had a Scottish accent.
00:45:00,00:45:02,He kept not getting films off the back of it
00:45:02,00:45:05,"because they kept saying, we don't need a Scottish guy"
00:45:05,00:45:06,in this movie.
00:45:06,00:45:08,"He was Canadian, that was just an accent."
00:45:08,00:45:11,But he was so tight cast to that character
00:45:11,00:45:12,"that yeah, he lost roles."
00:45:12,00:45:16,"- I was told, did you guys read about Jagdish Raj Kuranah,"
00:45:16,00:45:19,"who's a, he's got Guinness World Record,"
00:45:19,00:45:21,"he's a body with actor, he was, he died in 2013."
00:45:21,00:45:23,He's got a Guinness World Record
00:45:23,00:45:26,for being the most tight cast actor.
00:45:26,00:45:30,And he played the role of a police inspector in 144 films.
00:45:30,00:45:30,- Wow.
00:45:30,00:45:35,"- Which is just, and I looked at his whole Wikipedia list of films."
00:45:35,00:45:36,"And God, he worked hard."
00:45:36,00:45:39,Small bit parters were bloody hard.
00:45:39,00:45:41,They do about 10 films a year.
00:45:41,00:45:43,So he also played a doctor 10 times.
00:45:43,00:45:45,And he had various ones where you'd think maybe
00:45:45,00:45:46,"he wasn't gonna be a policeman,"
00:45:46,00:45:50,like a film called 'Soo Hog' and he's visiting a brothel
00:45:50,00:45:52,and he's a bit of an underworld character.
00:45:52,00:45:53,- Bicking up a gang wanger.
00:45:53,00:45:54,- Exactly.
00:45:54,00:45:57,- He's doing some gang banging undercover cop.
00:45:57,00:45:57,There we go.
00:45:57,00:45:59,- That's good.
00:45:59,00:46:00,"- But if you know the actor, you will know"
00:46:00,00:46:01,"he will turn out to be a cop, right?"
00:46:01,00:46:02,"- Yeah, you're so right, that ruins it."
00:46:02,00:46:07,"- Yeah, I read that he had his own police uniform"
00:46:07,00:46:09,"that he used to keep up, 'cause he was gonna be a policeman"
00:46:09,00:46:10,so often in his movies.
00:46:10,00:46:13,And he has his son called Bobby.
00:46:13,00:46:14,"- Oh, no."
00:46:14,00:46:15,- Nice.
00:46:15,00:46:16,- Lovely stuff.
00:46:16,00:46:18,"- You know how Jack Reacher, the character, got his name?"
00:46:18,00:46:22,'Cause Lee Child chose his pen name
00:46:22,00:46:24,because it would be between Raymond Chanber
00:46:24,00:46:26,"and Agatha Christie is the story, okay?"
00:46:26,00:46:30,"But Jack Reacher, the character, is named"
00:46:30,00:46:32,because he's good at reaching things.
00:46:32,00:46:34,"So Lee Child is very tall, right?"
00:46:34,00:46:35,That is true.
00:46:35,00:46:37,And he started writing these books
00:46:37,00:46:38,during a period of unemployment.
00:46:38,00:46:40,"He used to be like a 90 feet floor manager, I think."
00:46:40,00:46:43,And he was sacked from that job and started writing.
00:46:43,00:46:44,"But during that period where he was unemployed,"
00:46:44,00:46:46,"when he was in the supermarket,"
00:46:46,00:46:47,"or little odd ladies would sometimes say,"
00:46:47,00:46:50,"""Can you reach that thing for me down?"""
00:46:50,00:46:51,"And his wife used to tease him,"
00:46:51,00:46:53,"saying, ""Maybe you could get a job as being a Reacher."""
00:46:53,00:46:56,And he's since turned that into a globe straddling
00:46:56,00:46:58,like the cultural empire of--
00:46:58,00:46:59,- So funny.
00:46:59,00:47:00,"- And I haven't read or seen the films,"
00:47:00,00:47:03,but is Jack Reacher someone who's always fitting like bulbs?
00:47:03,00:47:04,Is he a handyman?
00:47:04,00:47:07,- He's basically like a human Mr. Tickle.
00:47:07,00:47:10,"- Right, okay, there's so much more fun than they hear."
00:47:10,00:47:13,"- Yeah, he is very, the character is very tall."
00:47:13,00:47:17,"- Which was the huge controversy when Tom Cruise was cast,"
00:47:17,00:47:18,because he was--
00:47:18,00:47:19,- Oh my god.
00:47:19,00:47:20,"- Yeah, honestly, what everyone--"
00:47:20,00:47:23,- There's someone who doesn't get type cast as a shartass.
00:47:23,00:47:24,- Does he?
00:47:24,00:47:26,"- Jack Reacher's six, five, I believe."
00:47:26,00:47:27,- Is he?
00:47:27,00:47:28,- Is he?
00:47:28,00:47:30,"- Yeah, and he's a tough guy."
00:47:30,00:47:32,I think there's one book where he stops a bullet
00:47:32,00:47:34,"with his chest, and that's right."
00:47:34,00:47:36,"- That's not easy to do, can I just say?"
00:47:36,00:47:39,But it's not that easy to survive it.
00:47:39,00:47:39,- Sorry.
00:47:39,00:47:42,(laughing)
00:47:42,00:47:43,- Yes.
00:47:43,00:47:44,"- I'm sort of a, I know I'm not used to this part,"
00:47:44,00:47:47,"but I'm astonished that he, specifically a 6.5"
00:47:47,00:47:48,and he's played by Tom Cruise.
00:47:48,00:47:49,Was that a funny joke?
00:47:49,00:47:53,"- No, the first Jack Reacher film with Tom Cruise is brilliant."
00:47:53,00:47:54,It's really good.
00:47:54,00:47:55,The second one is also decent.
00:47:55,00:47:55,"- Yeah, go back."
00:47:55,00:47:57,- Do they have very small actors around him
00:47:57,00:47:58,to make him look tall?
00:47:58,00:48:00,- They cast only bunch of kids.
00:48:00,00:48:03,"Yeah, and he beats up a hell of a lot of bunch of kids"
00:48:03,00:48:04,in that film.
00:48:04,00:48:07,"- No, you're right."
00:48:07,00:48:09,"I think they just show him like he's short,"
00:48:09,00:48:11,but he's accelerating up towards your face with his fists.
00:48:11,00:48:12,- I see.
00:48:12,00:48:13,- Right.
00:48:13,00:48:14,"- Oh, it's good."
00:48:14,00:48:16,"- It's not mentioned in the movie, his height."
00:48:16,00:48:18,It's how they go around it.
00:48:18,00:48:21,"They don't go, ""Oh my God, he's huge."""
00:48:21,00:48:22,- They don't call him Jack Cart Reacher.
00:48:22,00:48:25,(laughing)
00:48:25,00:48:29,"- Dan, I have a fact that I wonder if you know,"
00:48:29,00:48:32,"or anyone, in absolutely fabulous,"
00:48:32,00:48:35,"internationalist as great British comedy,"
00:48:35,00:48:40,"Jennifer Saunders' character is Eddie, Adina Monsoon."
00:48:40,00:48:41,Do you know why she's called that?
00:48:41,00:48:42,- Hmm.
00:48:42,00:48:44,"- Can you work it out if you know stuff about her life,"
00:48:44,00:48:46,which I reckon you do?
00:48:46,00:48:48,Eddie Monsoon is her name.
00:48:48,00:48:50,- Eddie Monsoon.
00:48:50,00:48:52,"- Eddie Monsoon, do you know any about her personal life?"
00:48:52,00:48:54,"- Yeah, she's married to Adrian Edmondson,"
00:48:54,00:48:56,and he's Eddie in bottom.
00:48:56,00:48:57,- Ed Monsoon.
00:48:57,00:48:58,- There you go.
00:48:58,00:48:59,- Wow.
00:48:59,00:49:00,- There you go.
00:49:00,00:49:00,- That's an incredible fact.
00:49:00,00:49:02,- Isn't that nice?
00:49:02,00:49:03,- Ed Monsoon.
00:49:03,00:49:04,- Ed Monsoon.
00:49:04,00:49:05,- Very good.
00:49:05,00:49:06,- There you go.
00:49:06,00:49:07,"It's a shame that Andy had to get that for you,"
00:49:07,00:49:09,but you helped him.
00:49:09,00:49:11,- Made it all the more exciting.
00:49:11,00:49:13,- You two are working as a great team today.
00:49:13,00:49:16,(laughing)
00:49:16,00:49:18,- So sometimes character names can get you in trouble.
00:49:18,00:49:19,- Oh yeah.
00:49:19,00:49:23,"- There is a writer called Jake Arnett, author of books."
00:49:23,00:49:25,"And in 2006 he was writing a book,"
00:49:25,00:49:28,and he had a character in it who was a real villain.
00:49:28,00:49:30,"It was a 1960s cabaret singer,"
00:49:30,00:49:33,"and he named him Tony Rocco, right?"
00:49:33,00:49:36,And the character was a real sleaze bag
00:49:36,00:49:38,who preyed on teenage boys.
00:49:38,00:49:41,"Now unfortunately for Jake Arnett,"
00:49:41,00:49:44,there was a real 1960s London cabaret singer
00:49:44,00:49:47,"called Tony Rocco, who was not a pervert"
00:49:47,00:49:48,who preyed on teenage boys.
00:49:48,00:49:49,"And he was still trading,"
00:49:49,00:49:51,having had a very successful hit single
00:49:51,00:49:54,and was still performing with a loyal fan base.
00:49:54,00:49:54,- Wow.
00:49:54,00:49:56,- Obviously he was not happy when this book came out.
00:49:56,00:49:59,- Was it a complete coincidence?
00:49:59,00:50:00,- It was a complete coincidence.
00:50:00,00:50:02,"He just, I don't know, he hadn't Googled it."
00:50:02,00:50:04,- So did he get sued?
00:50:04,00:50:06,"- There was a legal process, which played out,"
00:50:06,00:50:09,"and led to some compensation being paid, I think."
00:50:09,00:50:11,"And Tony Rocco, the real Tony Rocco said,"
00:50:11,00:50:13,"""I'm very glad we can just work this out and move on."""
00:50:13,00:50:17,- There was a famous thing with Peter Kay in Phoenix night.
00:50:17,00:50:18,Was it in Phoenix night?
00:50:18,00:50:20,So the one that he did before that.
00:50:20,00:50:21,But it was one of his sitcoms
00:50:21,00:50:24,and there was a character called Keith Ladd
00:50:24,00:50:27,who was like a health and safety officer
00:50:27,00:50:29,who had sex with dogs.
00:50:29,00:50:33,And it turned out that Peter Kayd had previously worked
00:50:33,00:50:36,with the health and safety officer called Keith Ladd.
00:50:36,00:50:37,- Oh.
00:50:37,00:50:40,- And it was a complete coincidence.
00:50:40,00:50:41,- Was it really?
00:50:41,00:50:43,"- It was, says Mr. Kayd."
00:50:43,00:50:45,And there was some legal process.
00:50:45,00:50:48,"And again, I think some, some--"
00:50:48,00:50:50,- A compensation was distributed.
00:50:50,00:50:51,- I believe it was.
00:50:51,00:50:54,"- It might have been the compensation went to,"
00:50:54,00:50:55,"you know, fire safety thing."
00:50:55,00:50:56,"- Well, dog trust."
00:50:56,00:50:58,(laughing)
00:50:58,00:50:59,"- Well, then there were things within books"
00:50:59,00:51:03,where people would add the detail of a small penis
00:51:03,00:51:05,if they were describing someone so that they would never sue
00:51:05,00:51:08,'cause they wouldn't want to admit that the character was them.
00:51:08,00:51:10,"- Yes, it's not one prime prejudice."
00:51:10,00:51:11,"It cut out chapter four, isn't it?"
00:51:11,00:51:13,(laughing)
00:51:13,00:51:15,"- But if I write a character called, like,"
00:51:15,00:51:19,"Den Tribeur, who's, I write as a really, a real bastard"
00:51:19,00:51:20,"and I say, and he's got a small penis,"
00:51:20,00:51:22,"is that gonna stop me sewing, Den?"
00:51:22,00:51:23,- What the small penis bit?
00:51:23,00:51:24,- Yeah.
00:51:24,00:51:27,'Cause it's so obvious I'm making fun of you in the book.
00:51:27,00:51:28,- Yeah.
00:51:28,00:51:29,"- And in fact, this is gonna be a great idea"
00:51:29,00:51:30,for my next novel.
00:51:30,00:51:33,(laughing)
00:51:35,00:51:37,- This is small penis coming to it.
00:51:37,00:51:38,"- Well, it's part of the reason he's cuckled it"
00:51:38,00:51:40,by his Northern Chinese wife.
00:51:40,00:51:42,(laughing)
00:51:42,00:51:44,"Well, I'd be angry, but this sounds so damn good."
00:51:44,00:51:45,(laughing)
00:51:45,00:51:46,I'm in.
00:51:46,00:51:47,(laughing)
00:51:47,00:51:48,"- Well, you're not quite in."
00:51:48,00:51:50,(laughing)
00:51:50,00:51:54,(upbeat music)
