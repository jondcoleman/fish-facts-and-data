00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.200
 "Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.320
 coming to you from the QI offices in Hobern."

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.660
 This episode's Annotishinsky's last episode for a while, as she heads off onto maternity

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.300
 leave. We'll be seeing her in nine months, but we've got one more episode. Once again,

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.640
 we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.880
 days, and in a particular order, here we go. Starting with fact number one, and that

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:45.660
 is my fact. My fact this week is that Harriet Beatrice Stowe, author of Uncle Tom's Cabin,

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:53.420
 wrote the novel for the first time twice. This is a story I found it on a website

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:59.060
 that is Uncle Tom's Cabin, an American culture. It's a dedicated page to all historical articles

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:04.940
 about Harriet Beatrice Stowe. In it, it points out that near the end of her life, she was suffering

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.540
 from a disease of the brain. She might have dementia, she might have Alzheimer's, we're

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.900
 not quite sure. But in that period, she found herself rewriting as if it were a new story

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.620
 Uncle Tom's Cabin, and telling everyone, "I've got this amazing book that I'm writing.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.620
 I think it's going to be big." Apparently, when people were looking at the writing, it

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.480
 was almost word for word what the original book was. The Washington Post said, "If the

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.460
 manuscript could be compared with the corresponding portions of the original copy, it is not likely

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.220
 that much difference of appearance would be discovered."

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.660
 So it wasn't a big prose-lavery tract suddenly that she found herself producing in the

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:41.660
 '80s.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.420
 We should explain those two things, Harriet Beatrice Stowe, and Uncle Tom's Cabin, I guess.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.860
 It's a property book, isn't it? How to make a desirable residence on a budget.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.900
 This is a game-changing book in America.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.060
 Harriet Beatrice Stowe, she was very much against the world of slavery in America, came from

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:05.420
 a family that was very, very much fighting that cause. So she wrote a series of stories

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.900
 that were published, like how Dickens used to do it. It's serialized in a magazine.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.300
 When the book came out, it just really hit a note. It suddenly made sense to a lot of

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.760
 white America about what was going on. There was this new thing that was put in place in

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.980
 this period whereby if you were caught housing a runaway slave, you were now going to jail,

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.180
 or you were going to be fined, which meant that no one was looking after these people. And

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.740
 then there was very much parallels of what's going on right now in America. People were

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.860
 being taken away. Black Americans would know due process, and they were being jailed, and

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.380
 it was a hectic time. So this book was saying this is not acceptable.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.940
 It arguably led to the civil war. I think, right?

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.700
 Yeah, Lincoln jokes about that, didn't they? The little woman who started the civil war.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.980
 I love that. So they met. Harriet Beatrice Stowe, Met Lincoln, and I think about 1862, and

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.300
 he supposedly said that to her on the little woman who wrote the book that started this

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.180
 great war. I think it might be a later. Her family said it would have been said later.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.700
 They were allowed to do that. They achieved a lot of the family.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.920
 But for sure, it did change a lot of minds in America. It was so, sorry to go into book

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.440
 sales mode, but it was so successful. I think it sold 300,000 copies in the USA in its first

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.960
 year. And it I think might have been the biggest seller of any book in that century, the

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.920
 19th century, barring the Bible. I think it was. It was big. The time said that the amount

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.600
 of royalties that she got is the largest sum of money ever received by any author, either

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.160
 American or European, from the sales of a single work in such an amount of time.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.040
 Wow. Do you know what the second best selling book of the 1850s was?

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:44.480
 Oh, good question. 1850s. Is this guessable? Dickens? No, no, it's not guessable. I'd be astonished

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.840
 if you don't have it. Right. It hasn't had the same kind of longevity as Uncle Tom's

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.120
 cabin. So Uncle Tom's cabin was the top. And then the second was called Ten Nights in

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.880
 a Bar, and what I saw there. Absolutely. That sounds awesome. It does sound like more fun

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.320
 reading. Unless it's like, because I've been to bars regularly, and actually you tend

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.840
 to see the same things again and again. It's like, oh, that group of people watching

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.680
 the horse racing. Yeah, same like crying in the corner. There's Andy telling the same

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.640
 anecdote over and over again. I empathise with Harriet and be just, I don't mean to trivialise

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.960
 whatever condition she had, but like I frequently will get to the end of an anecdote and people

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:22.640
 around me are going, yeah, yes, Andy, yes, that was, yeah, that was, that was an anecdote. I told

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.840
 you. Half an hour ago. In that article, by the way, because I found it in the newspaper

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.360
 archives, they also said that she had confusedly given permission to two publishers to write

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:39.200
 her official biography thinking that they were the same person. And there's a big sort of financial

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:44.280
 problem between those two companies. I can really imagine doing that now. Actually, like

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.180
 you see that same, not very good with family. You've got face blindness. You've probably promised

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.280
 your biography to ten of them. Yeah, I'm quite disappointed. It hasn't been written yet.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.440
 What's really interesting is the reaction to the book. Because obviously, as we've also had

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.280
 a huge reaction, there was a real life inspiration, a man called Josiah Henson, who was himself

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.720
 enslaved and in real life escaped to Canada and founded a settlement and a school for former

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:13.520
 slaves. But what's amazing is after the book came out and had this huge social reaction

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:19.400
 and effect, there was a ferocious pro-slavery pushback even in the novel sphere. So at least

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:25.760
 15 novels were published in response, very much in favor of slavery, saying slaves in the

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.000
 south are better off and then free men and women in the north. So one of them was called

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.760
 Uncle Robin in his cabin in Virginia and Tom, without one, in Boston. Not a good title.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:42.200
 Like we can all agree. A shit title for a book. And the argument inside, obviously. Yeah.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:47.160
 Yeah, and you were saying that it was kind of in magazines to start off with, it was serialized.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.960
 They also had pro-slavery magazines. Right. Basically doing the opposite. So if you went

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:57.440
 to WHO Smiths in mid-19th century America, on the shelves, you would have half of them

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.640
 would be pro-slavery magazines and half would be anti-slavery magazines. Well, it was like

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:06.440
 the BBC today. You've got to have balance, haven't you? If you get on then. Get on the

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.460
 anti-fascist, you've got to get on the fascist. But she wrote another book off the back of Uncle

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.860
 Tom's cabin, the key to Uncle Tom's cabin, which was basically a bibliography describing

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.680
 everything that had gone into Uncle Tom's cabin. She named Josiah Henson as the inspiration

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.880
 for the Uncle Tom character. Because they were like, oh, you just made it up. You'd never

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.240
 even been here. You don't know any enslaved people. You just like, and she needed to prove

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.660
 that it wasn't like that. Yeah. But good. I mean, great. When the publisher says, what's

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:36.520
 next? Harriet? Well, it's more Uncle Tom's cabin in a good way. That's a good idea. Like,

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.580
 you know, like the QI fat books that we used to write. We could write another one saying,

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:45.080
 no, no, this is true. Well, that's the thing. Well, then I'm keeping our sources. Because

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.960
 I have a panic attack every time James sent me an email going, and what is your source

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.680
 for this? Like, I don't know. I do need it immediately. Which James, you want to publish

00:06:53.680 --> 00:07:01.400
 a book of just pure URLs. It's the key to QI. I got another one of her writings. Lady Byron

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:08.960
 vindicated. Oh, yeah. This is where she gets spicy. Yeah. She was defending Byron's widow

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:15.420
 by revealing that Byron had an affair with his own sister half sister. Okay. Not that that

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:26.980
 changes matters. Sorry. Half sister. Oh, well, that's not even a fact then. Is that not interesting?

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:32.660
 No, it was incredibly. This was a second most controversial book. I'd say when she published

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:37.940
 this piece in the Atlantic, American magazine still going today, it lost them 15,000 subscribers

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.620
 who said, I don't mind reading about various other things, but I draw the line at Law Byron

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:45.740
 having an affair with his half sister. I think it was a third of a subscriber's cloud. I mean,

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:49.740
 that's a big hit, isn't it? That's one article you feel so. You know what? She wrote another

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:56.100
 book in 1873 called Women in Sacred History, where she said that one of the apostles was

00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:01.460
 a woman, Lydia. So she was just an edgelard. Yeah. It's just keeping coming. That's stunning.

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:05.260
 Yeah. And the clue is in the name, isn't it? Lydia the Apostle? Oh, there's no one else

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:13.500
 in that. Did you say which of the apostles was? Yeah, Lydia. No, but which was that Thomas?

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:18.180
 No, I think like the Bible, just there are actually 13 apostles, but the Bible never mentioned

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:22.540
 it. See, it must have been one of the judices. Well, there were two judices. That's right.

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:26.700
 Two James's. One of them must have been the Lydia. I reckon. You just like panicked and

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:30.180
 gave the name of the person she was looking at. That's what you do, isn't it? It's a Mrs.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:35.860
 outfire moment. Just quickly on the on the Byron thing, because she was great mates with Lady Byron,

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:41.180
 because after Uncle Tom's cabin, she met everyone. I mean, she was friends with so many

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:46.660
 eminent people. George Elliott, wouldn't she? Great mates. But this wrecked her reputation,

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:50.460
 the Byron book. There was so much criticism. She had to hire a secretary to deal with the

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:55.380
 correspondence and hire a lawyer. And the person who stood up for her, I'm afraid enemy

00:08:55.380 --> 00:09:00.820
 of the podcast, Mark Twain, he stood up for her and he was really good about it. And I just

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:04.540
 think that's inviscated a bit. They were mates. They were mates. They were mates, but have

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:07.300
 you seen what he was running about her in their later life? Because they were neighbours,

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:10.460
 not just mates. Oh, what did he say about her? I mean, it's not very nice.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:16.140
 She trimmed the head wrong. Yeah. That's not getting the garden. Dogwood shit in his garden.

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:20.860
 No, he said her mind had decayed and she was a pathetic figure. But I think he means

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:27.740
 pathetic, not as in we mean pathetic. Yeah, that's not criticism. I read that wrong then.

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:31.300
 Yeah, that no pathetic back then would have meant someone that you feel really sorry for

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:35.620
 because she's got really unwell. And then he wrote, people in the area where they both

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:39.900
 of them lived would leave their doors open and then Harriet Beecher Stowe would go into

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:49.020
 their houses and then push them over and go, "Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop,

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:52.060
 whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop. She wrote that as well."

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:56.260
 But then also that she would play her piano and you'd hear her singing melancholic songs to

00:09:56.260 --> 00:10:00.420
 great effect. Right. Yeah, no, they were mates. They were mates. Okay, cool. Can we finally

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:04.540
 talk about her husband? Because we talk about these women all the time on this podcast,

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:09.500
 don't we? Agreed. She wrote a lot of stuff, but he did write a pamphlet.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:16.020
 And the pamphlet that he wrote described the frequent visitations from tiny fairies that

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:21.980
 danced on his windowsill. Really? Yeah. And I bet he talked about his pamphlet much more

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:27.980
 than she talked about her, like 50 seminal books and crucial impact on 19th century literature.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:32.100
 Well, I can tell you that his fairies that he saw were ruled over by King and Queen, who

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:37.060
 were slightly larger than the other fairies, but they had a sinister and selfish expression

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:40.860
 on their faces that stopped him from trusting them. Even though they always smiled, there

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:44.380
 is something sinister about them, so he didn't trust these fairies. Sorry, is this a vision

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:48.540
 he had, and then he wrote into a pamphlet? Or is this a metaphor for something? It's a metaphor.

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:52.740
 Yeah, it's what he thought, yeah. That's kind of sad, because I know he was very encouraging

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:56.700
 of her, this very career, and she probably felt like she should do the same for him, but...

00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:00.500
 I just need a quick quote for the cover, darling, if that's all right. Just like something

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:05.100
 about the fairies and how they're really well described or something. Yeah, yeah, well,

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.500
 yeah. Sorry, I've got to go meet Queen Victoria now.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:19.740
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy. My fact is, some tortoises have hinges.

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:26.380
 So these are imaginatively named animals called hingeback tortoises, and there are loads of species,

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:31.100
 and they have a hinge at the back. It's like a hatchback car. Yeah. And it means their back can

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:36.380
 just go boom, and close up when they're trying to retreat into their shell. There are loads of

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:39.580
 different species. There's the forest, there's bells, there's the homes, there's the western.

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:44.540
 I saw some of them two weeks ago, which is why I submitted this fact, yeah. That's so cool.

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:49.580
 Could you see the hinge? I couldn't get my arm quite far off into the enclosure to...

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:57.020
 It was a shame, but I read all about them. This was in a little rainforest experience near

00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:03.500
 Reading. It's the home of rainforest experiences. It's a fantastic place, like it's amazing,

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:06.780
 the stuff they had there. Anyway, and they have these. Sorry, when you say retreat into their shell,

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.820
 I would have thought that that would be on the front, then you'd put their head, retract

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:12.860
 their heads in, and then they'd drop a hinge down. But what they're retreating their bottom into

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:16.380
 their shell, and then they're... I think they're legs on their legs and their tail, basically.

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:20.460
 Their legs and their tail just go back in. I don't think any species has yet evolved a front hinge,

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:24.380
 but that's something evolution is probably working on. So if the predates are comes from the front,

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:28.620
 they're buggered. Well, I don't know. I mean, because you're always going to be running away from

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:33.420
 a predator, aren't you? So it does make sense that you're closing the back. Yeah. They can retreat

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:36.940
 a fair bit inside. I think they can pull, obviously, they can pull their heads in. I just don't know

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:41.100
 how far in. There are some which have a really awkward thing where they put their head in and to the

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:46.620
 side, and they just sort of scooch in there like that. I'm doing it now for the benefit of listeners.

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:49.900
 You've done a lot of physical stuff so far in this fact for the benefit of listeners,

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:55.100
 that they're enjoying. That's more to come. I believe also the hinge helps them to open their shell

00:12:55.100 --> 00:13:01.020
 a bit further and lay their eggs. And they have eggs that are bigger than average for a turtle,

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:06.700
 which means that the hinge is useful. Brilliant. They're mutant turtles. They do live into their

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:10.620
 teens, I believe. Yeah. And we should say just because you've chucked in the word turtle now,

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:13.820
 and I didn't look into them, but they are tortoises, right? Yeah, they are. Although they're

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:16.860
 often used interchangeably, and we've talked about the difference. Well, tortoises are turtle,

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:23.020
 but a turtle's not a tortoise. Yeah. Okay, I get it. Yeah. I don't. And they also, their shell,

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:27.740
 is slightly different than normal shells. It's got a little channel that when it rains,

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:31.820
 the water goes down the channel and goes straight to their mouth. What no it doesn't.

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:36.140
 They've got guttering. What do you mean? Like one of those American sports hats that has a straw

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:40.460
 that comes right in. Exactly like that. They shouldn't be the hinge back tortoise. They should be

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:47.420
 the beer can. That's tartar. That's unbelievable. Yeah. That's incredible. That's incredible.

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:52.700
 Evolution, man. I know we say it week in, week out on this show, but it's thrown up some cracking

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:59.980
 stuff. It does well. Yeah. There are box turtles, and they are slightly different. I think they might

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:04.380
 also be a kind of tortoise, but they're definitely called the box turtle, and they have a hinge on

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:10.060
 their belly, which helps them to close the front and back half up like a box when they flex it.

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:15.340
 So they become, like all your innards are going to drop out every time you open it. I believe it goes

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:22.700
 the opposite way to that. Yes. Right. I think it's closing up, not opening out. I'm splitting open.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:28.860
 I've got to pick that up. Yeah. I find that hard to visualise without anything. I'm not getting on

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:37.900
 the floor, but I'm sorry. But the eastern box turtle was going to be made the official state emblem,

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:41.980
 or one of the official state emblems of Virginia. You know, every American state has like this is the

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:47.260
 official state fern and the official state ice cream flavour. Yeah. Exactly. And so Virginia,

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:51.580
 they suggested a couple of times in different years, bills to honour the eastern box turtle.

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:56.060
 And I just really like this. I think this is from the Wikipedia about them. In 2009,

00:14:56.060 --> 00:15:01.420
 delegate Frank Hargrove of Hannover asked why Virginia would make an official emblem of an animal

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:06.540
 that retreats into its shell when frightened and dies by the thousands crawling across roads.

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:10.780
 I just think that's such a mean thing. Yeah. Yeah, it's got other assets. It's not it's fault

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:18.540
 that we've created the car. No, exactly. On turtles being able to do entertaining things.

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:26.060
 In the olden days, I found this out in a study which was called tortoise rides and alligator slides.

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:30.380
 In zoos that had tortoises, tortoise rides were the thing. It was like the donkey ride,

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:34.860
 but it was a tortoise ride. I've seen a photo of Rothschild on the back of a tortoise.

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:38.540
 Rothschild loved riding his tortoises. Yes, but if you went to the zoo, sorry.

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:44.380
 You wanted to just Walter Rothschild, who was a big old collector. Is that one knows who Rothschild is?

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:49.020
 Or it might be that I couldn't remember his first name, so I just said his surname.

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:52.460
 But this is what you would do if you went to any zoo which had giant tortoises,

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:56.540
 then they would offer rides and it would either be just lots of children would climb on top.

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:59.980
 Or they had little tortoise carriages and the tortoise would pull it.

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:04.220
 Okay, that is cute. I don't know why we stopped doing that.

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:07.100
 No, let's bring it back.

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:09.740
 What's an alligator slide, sorry.

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:15.260
 The alligator slide. No, it was said in this study that this was the most outrageous thing

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:20.460
 that they made animals do, but basically it was making an alligator go up before me to high-ish ramp.

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:23.980
 And then sliding down a steep slide, which sounds to me incredibly fun.

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:27.340
 You wouldn't have to make me do that. You're not an alligator though, are you?

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:31.020
 I'm not an alligator. Also, alligator rides were commonly offered.

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:35.260
 There were lots of pictures of children. Children sitting on the backs of alligators.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:36.940
 It's not your most loved child though.

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:38.940
 I think it would be the least favourite. Yeah, number three.

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:44.060
 I guess if you lock the mouth shut, you're okay if you're not in water.

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:47.660
 You can hold the mouth shut with no force or with elastic band, you can hold it.

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:50.460
 And that's what you'll say to child number three as you said in English.

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:53.580
 Come on, little Johnny, you're stronger than the elastic band, aren't you?

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:56.860
 What kind of pair of you? You see an elastic band over their mouth?

00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:58.620
 You go, "Yeah, it's all good, man. It's all good."

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:03.180
 I can't say. In the pictures I saw in the mouth, it was hanging open.

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:06.620
 As it crumbled along with the child, but I'm sure that they're very well-trained.

00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:11.180
 Just to say, the jaws of these animals like crocodiles and alligators and camons,

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:14.060
 they're really strong for closing, they're really weak for opening.

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:19.420
 No, absolutely. That's the kind of ki-fact that, in real life, I'm not sure.

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:23.500
 I'm willing to put my reputation on the line and my genitals.

00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:29.420
 No, you have further alligator, a very good breakfast already, right? I think so.

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:32.220
 It was either today or last week that he had breakfast. I'm sure he's still full.

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:36.620
 Have you guys heard other unusual tortoises and turtles and things?

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:38.860
 The African pancake tortoise.

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:43.020
 No, this is a great one. I'm going to say flat.

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:48.060
 It's flat. It's got a flat shell, but the cool thing about it is not only that,

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:53.820
 but it's that it can flip over very quickly when it lands on its back because it's so light.

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:56.940
 It's a bit like in robot wars, there's always one that can write itself.

00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:57.500
 Yeah.

00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:59.580
 And those are always the most dangerous robots of all.

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.740
 But you're saying this can flip onto its back very quickly?

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:03.740
 I can say it flips off its back.

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:05.100
 It can write itself.

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:09.020
 So like the fingers with tortoises is at least in cartoons,

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:12.300
 they end up on their back and they can't get back onto their feet, right?

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:13.580
 I think that is real.

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:18.140
 I think it takes twice or three times as much energy for most of them to do that as it would to walk.

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:18.940
 So that's great.

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:22.220
 Well, the African pancake one, though, it has a very light shell which means it can run

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:24.220
 much faster than your average tortoise.

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:26.700
 But it's not got a big defense because it's got a very light shell.

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:31.580
 So when it's threatened, it just runs for cover and it runs under a rocky crevice

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:34.940
 and then breathes in like a puff of fish.

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:37.900
 And it's impossible to pull it out because it's just wedged in there.

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:38.940
 Oh, so cool.

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:40.300
 The rock becomes the shell.

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:41.260
 Yeah, wow.

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:42.780
 You've really got to find the perfect shape, rock.

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:45.420
 I can imagine running to a huge pile of rocks is staring panic.

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:47.100
 So all of them, I can't get under that one.

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:47.900
 That one's too big.

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:50.780
 That one's, ah, where's the rock that's made for me, but cool.

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:51.660
 That's a really good point.

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:54.860
 Do they sus out the local rocks ahead of them?

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:56.700
 I don't have data.

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:59.900
 We found the new books of tortoises with all the rock locations.

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:02.780
 Well, because they do an interesting thing whereby they'll often sleep

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:04.940
 in a bit where they know the sun is going to get to them in the morning.

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:07.500
 So this is not all species of tortoises, but a lot.

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.180
 They can't dissipate the part of the sun.

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:09.820
 Yeah, quite clever.

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:10.780
 So that's where they will sleep.

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:13.740
 So they know that when the sun hits in the morning, it warms them up and it gets them going.

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:15.980
 They only have to have been there for the previous morning.

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:17.740
 They've got good memories.

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:18.620
 Yeah, okay.

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:19.660
 It's not so, okay.

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:24.060
 Unless they go to a new place on holiday and they just work out which way is east and west.

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:24.780
 That's quite cool.

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:28.300
 Because I've failed to do that on holiday when parking the car, for example.

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:30.700
 You park the higher car under the shade of the one tree.

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:32.300
 And you think, oh, that'll be right for four hours.

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:34.460
 Then you come back, same getting on a train.

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:37.500
 And you sit on one side of the train and you're like, oh, this will be beautiful.

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:38.860
 And then suddenly you're in there.

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:39.740
 You're in an oven.

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:40.300
 You're in an oven.

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:42.060
 Well, that's because you're both warm-blooded creatures.

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:43.580
 So you don't understand the necessity.

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:45.740
 If you were a tortoise, you would have died on that train.

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:47.500
 And you would have died on that path.

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.900
 So it's more important.

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:54.860
 Well, when the ticket collects, okay, my ran and hid between some perfectly sized suitcases.

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:57.740
 The Galapagos silence tortoises.

00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:00.780
 Very famous because of Darwin going there, finding them.

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:04.380
 And they were also really endangered.

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:06.300
 Partly because we ate them all.

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:07.580
 So Darwin came across them.

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:08.860
 They had delicious meat.

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:11.340
 Who rode them, too, didn't he?

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:12.620
 I think he did he ride them.

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:15.180
 Yeah, picture of him having a cheeky ride.

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:16.380
 Yeah, he was good.

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:18.220
 If you're the one who's discovered them.

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:18.700
 Yeah.

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:23.580
 And also, I think if you discover any species, you should be allowed to ride it.

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:25.100
 Yes, that's a good rule.

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.660
 I mean, incredibly fragile bats.

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:29.180
 No, I'm getting on that.

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:30.300
 Settle it up.

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:34.620
 I think if you discover a new species, you get a little card.

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:36.700
 And you can go to any zoo in the world.

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:39.500
 And you just pull it out and you go, "I'm allowed to ride this."

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:44.700
 The Lama is recovering from a serious lumbar region surgery, it doesn't matter.

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:48.380
 So yeah, they were big and delicious.

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:49.580
 And they were endangered.

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:51.420
 And actually, on the island of Espanola,

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:53.740
 there's a specific kind of giant tortoise,

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:57.580
 which was down to 14 in number in the 1970s.

00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:57.980
 Wow.

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:00.300
 But now, their numbers have really recovered.

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:02.860
 And there are over 3,000 because of breeding programs.

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:05.100
 And the reason this is really important to conserve them.

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:08.380
 One of the reasons is that they're extremely important for albatrosses.

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:11.660
 Because they facilitate something about albatross lives.

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:13.500
 What do you think of when you think albatrosses?

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:15.820
 I think of them at sea, bad luck.

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:17.140
 - Yeah. - In Japan. - Oh, no.

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:17.940
 - In Japan. - In Japan.

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:18.780
 - In Japan. - In Japan.

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:19.620
 - Crossbow. - Yes, yeah.

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:22.300
 - And they fly for extremely long periods.

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:24.340
 - That's good. - Oh, big wingspanes.

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:26.260
 - Big, there we go.

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:27.780
 You can have your guest down, but we've got the rounds.

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:28.620
 - I think, I think.

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:30.500
 - It was a phrase in car games, a dead rubber.

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:33.460
 - Well, there's absolutely no consequence whatsoever.

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.580
 - I wouldn't see that on university challenge

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:37.700
 where someone buzzes in, "Bzzz."

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:39.580
 Lord Byron, that's correct.

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:41.260
 - That goes, "No, no, I can have another guest."

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:42.780
 Sorry, Jeremy, just quickly.

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:45.500
 - I think. - Yes.

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:48.860
 - That, quite often they need to crack things open.

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:51.660
 And there's nothing that's really hard around.

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:54.340
 So, an albatross will fly over a giant tortoise,

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:56.860
 drop the item, be it an egg or whatever.

00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:58.980
 It cracks open on their tortoise shell.

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:00.580
 - Like a reverse escalus.

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:02.180
 - Yes, exactly. - Oh.

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:03.540
 - Exactly. - That is correct.

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:05.420
 That's actually how albatross has hatched their eggs

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:08.100
 is they dropped more bags of tortoises.

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:11.740
 - So escalus supposedly died when an eagle was carrying a tortoise

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:12.740
 and dropped it on his head,

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:14.020
 'cause thinking it was a rock.

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:16.660
 - Exactly, yeah, this is the opposite of that.

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:18.300
 - Is he right, Anna?

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:19.940
 - It's really more about Andy's answer

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:22.180
 that they're very big windspans.

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:24.740
 Mean that, and the fact that they're very large anyway,

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:27.020
 they need a long runway to take off

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:29.020
 'cause they keep running and flapping, but like this one.

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:30.940
 And they need to be very wide.

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:32.900
 And as soon as the tortoises went,

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:35.780
 what they do is they tramp up and down the mountains all day

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:38.020
 and they tramp down the vegetation straight lines

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:40.860
 and they make these flawless, huge runways.

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:43.500
 And without them, the albatrosses can't take off.

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.620
 So the albatrosses were all dying out as well.

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:47.220
 - I don't think Andy got that right.

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:49.900
 I think he just said wings and you filled in the rest.

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:53.020
 - It's a very big, and I was about to go on to say,

00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:55.100
 exactly that about what they're creating.

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:56.340
 - Yeah, sorry.

00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:58.220
 If you're a cuckold in Northern China.

00:22:58.220 --> 00:22:59.060
 - Yeah.

00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:01.140
 (laughing)

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:03.580
 - Big shout out to the cuckolds in Northern China.

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:05.380
 - I know, I know you guys are listening.

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:07.340
 You've got time on your hands, now she's gone.

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:11.180
 Your known as a tortoise, that term survives.

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:12.980
 It's hundreds of years old term.

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:13.820
 - Really?

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:14.660
 - Yeah.

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:15.500
 - Why is it?

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:17.060
 - Is it about being too slow and so someone's whips

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:18.060
 someone out from under your nose?

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:19.500
 - Oh, very good, but it's not right.

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:21.540
 - I think it was getting going into your shell.

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:22.380
 Something like that.

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:23.300
 - Yeah, that's it.

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:24.620
 So they're associated.

00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:25.460
 - I'm not a psycho.

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:26.300
 - I think I know.

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:30.660
 Basically, they're, I think they're associated with,

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:33.700
 I'm sorry to say a D2 messing penis.

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:37.940
 And so it's all sort of shrinking down and going

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:39.700
 soft and you're shirking danger as well.

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:40.540
 So that's why.

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:42.020
 - Thank god he didn't act that one out.

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:42.980
 (laughing)

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:44.140
 - I am, Dan, I am.

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:46.660
 You just can't see under the table.

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:48.500
 - Can I say one thing about hinges?

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:49.420
 - Oh, okay, yeah.

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:51.260
 - So there's a door in this room.

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:52.100
 - Yeah.

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:52.940
 - Yeah.

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:53.940
 - It leads to the next room.

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:55.980
 And there are three hinges on it.

00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:57.700
 What can you tell me about the spacing

00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:59.900
 of the top and bottom hinges?

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:01.660
 - The, the equidistant?

00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:02.500
 - Yeah, they seem, they seem--

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:03.660
 - They seem it, don't they?

00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:05.500
 - Yeah, they seem the same as in the top of the bottom.

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:06.740
 - Is the bottom one actually a bit closer

00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:08.380
 to the middle one compared to the top one?

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.220
 - Yeah, but the bottom one is further from the floor

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:11.940
 than the top one is from the top.

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:12.940
 - Oh!

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:14.660
 - And there's a few reasons for that.

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:16.700
 One of them is, it's an illusion.

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:17.540
 - Yeah.

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:18.620
 - So to you, it looks about the same,

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:19.820
 but actually it's not the same.

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:21.980
 And that's because of the foreshortening effects.

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:23.940
 So when things are slightly further away,

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:25.420
 distance looks different.

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:28.540
 And the other thing is, the top of your door,

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:30.740
 the hinge is holding more of the weight.

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:34.060
 So the top one needs to be closer to the top.

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:35.140
 - Close to the pivot.

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:35.980
 - Closer to the pivot.

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:36.820
 - Closer to the pivot weight.

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:37.660
 - Exactly, yeah.

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:38.380
 - We can all agree the middle one

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:39.740
 is not pulling its weight there, right?

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:40.580
 (laughing)

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:41.420
 - What's it he been doing?

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:42.980
 - What's middle hinge doing?

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:45.020
 - The middle one is there just because

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:47.260
 three is a good number for the size of a door.

00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:49.100
 - I guess it helps with the illusion as well.

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:50.020
 - Yeah, it does.

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:51.900
 - But the middle one is usually exactly in the middle.

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:52.740
 - That's very good to know this.

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:54.540
 So if you ever climb a step ladder

00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:55.700
 and suddenly look at your door and think,

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.220
 hang on, the hinges are all off.

00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:59.100
 And then you get down and think they're not again.

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:00.220
 That's just the illusion.

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:01.700
 - It might not just be the illusion

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:04.460
 if you're doing DIY, and it might be like,

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:06.380
 and with this particular door, James.

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:07.220
 - Yeah.

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:08.420
 - The frame that's around this door

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:10.580
 is not on the bottom, but is on the top.

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:11.400
 - Oh yeah.

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:13.240
 - It's creating anything towards that illusion as well

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:15.000
 that I'm adding in the frame.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.160
 - Can't hurt.

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.320
 (laughing)

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:19.560
 - If the frame is--

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:20.480
 - It's a little question of the night,

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:22.600
 because this is, he wants to get home.

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:24.800
 (laughing)

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:26.320
 - And all questions don't go.

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:27.160
 Bye.

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:29.740
 (upbeat music)

00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:34.800
 - Okay, and it's time for fact number three.

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:36.280
 And that is Anna.

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:39.480
 - My fact this week is that after Frida Kahlo died,

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:42.160
 all her clothes and possessions spent 50 years

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:43.300
 in a bathroom.

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:45.080
 - Wow.

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.680
 - Functioning bathroom?

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:48.400
 - People weren't going in and out using it, no.

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:50.280
 With no number ones, no number twos.

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:53.640
 - Big bathroom, 'cause presumably she had a lot of possessions.

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.640
 - She did have a hell of a lot of stuff in there,

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:56.880
 so because it must have been.

00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:00.600
 So just to tell you how this happened,

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:01.920
 it wasn't necessarily the plan,

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:04.280
 but Frida Kahlo died in 1954.

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:06.200
 - She was a Mexican artist.

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:07.920
 - And yes, to go back one step further,

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:09.320
 she was a Mexican artist.

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:11.640
 - Famously Mono Browd.

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.360
 - Famously Mono Browd, yes.

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:17.240
 - Imagine Oasis, but they're Mexican,

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:19.720
 and instead of singing songs, they paint stuff.

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:20.560
 - Yes.

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:24.680
 - And she did, she modeled herself on Oasis, actually.

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:25.880
 So I think you've got the picture.

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:30.640
 She dies 1954, her husband, Diego Rivera,

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:34.600
 shot all of her belongings in a bathroom in her house,

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.880
 which is called the Blue House in Mexico City.

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:38.520
 And it was a house where she'd been born,

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:41.080
 where she'd grown up, and where she and Diego Rivera lived,

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:42.360
 and where she'd died.

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:44.560
 And he said, "I want all of her possessions

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:48.120
 "to be locked in here until 15 years after I die."

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:48.960
 - 15.

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.120
 - 15.

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.960
 I know a bit of a twist coming.

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:53.920
 And we don't really know why.

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:56.360
 We think like out of sensitivity for her,

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:58.040
 things that might be revealed,

00:26:58.040 --> 00:26:59.680
 and thought, you know, give it a bit of time,

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:01.280
 'cause there's all her letters and stuff.

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:03.120
 But basically, he entrusted this task

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:05.440
 to a woman called Dolores Olmedo,

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:07.160
 who was a huge fan of Diego Rivera,

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:08.680
 as all women sort of were.

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.280
 He was obviously a compelling man.

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:12.000
 So I think she probably fancied him

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.160
 and definitely adored him, didn't really like Frida.

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:17.080
 And so she just never took him out.

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:19.120
 She just locked them in the bathroom,

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:21.840
 waited, Diego Rivera died a few years later,

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:22.960
 and she just kept them in there.

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:24.200
 - Of constipation.

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:26.800
 (laughing)

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:28.200
 'Cause the bathroom door was locked.

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:30.240
 - Indeed, no, but the rest of the house was full of shit,

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.360
 but the time you got there.

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:33.800
 (laughing)

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:36.640
 And yeah, it was only in 2004,

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:38.040
 after she died that someone said,

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:39.880
 "Should we open that bathroom for the Frida color shit,

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:40.720
 "see what's in there?"

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:43.280
 And it's all her stuff, 22,000 documents,

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:46.400
 300 items of clothing, 6,000 photos,

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:48.640
 her prosthetic leg, her back brace.

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:49.480
 - Oh, wow.

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:51.640
 - All of her makeup textiles.

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:53.560
 - So why did she need the prosthetic leg

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:54.760
 and her back brace?

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:55.600
 - Oh, yes.

00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:57.840
 Well, this is all part of her great stories,

00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:59.640
 isn't it, of pain and injury?

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:02.960
 - Well, she had a terrible, nearly fatal bus crash

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.080
 when she was 18.

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.480
 She was involved in that.

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:08.880
 She had already got polio as a girl.

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:10.480
 She already had to wear a prosthesis

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:12.920
 on her right leg due to the polio.

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:15.720
 And then this bus crash completely wrecked her life.

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:18.320
 She broke her pelvis, her collarbone, her ribs, her back.

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.200
 Most of her life, she had to wear plaster corsets

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:21.240
 to support her.

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:24.560
 And so much of this, as Anna says, made its way in her art.

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:26.160
 - Frequently about pain.

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:27.000
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:27.840
 - I mean, it's frequently just this,

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:29.520
 she's got this really badly broken body

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:30.360
 for the back bone.

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.000
 - She also painted her casts quite a lot, didn't she?

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:32.840
 - Yeah.

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:35.600
 - Kind of some of the first paintings she did was on her casts.

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:39.200
 And she even painted the bus that hit her on her cast,

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.600
 which I think is pretty badass.

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:42.040
 - We should talk a bit about this crash

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:44.440
 'cause it was an extreme crash.

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:45.520
 She was with her boyfriend.

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:48.800
 She was about 18, it was 1925.

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:52.680
 And basically a tram plowed very slowly into their bus.

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:54.800
 And the boyfriend remembers his knees

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:55.920
 were suddenly touching the knees

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:58.520
 of the people sitting on the bench opposite as it bent.

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:00.520
 And then the whole vehicle splintered

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:01.880
 into a million pieces.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:04.200
 And as well as all those horrendous breakages

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.840
 were the worst thing that happened

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:08.560
 was she got impaled on a steel handrail

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.520
 that went straight through her abdomen.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:13.560
 And she didn't realize at the time

00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:14.600
 the extent of her injuries.

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:16.280
 It's like, I guess you don't in the shock of the moment.

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:17.720
 She said, "The first thing I thought of

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:20.000
 was this Mexican toy that I just got."

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.240
 And I thought, "Oh, no, where is it?"

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:22.800
 I've lost it in the wreckage.

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:23.640
 - Yeah, right.

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:24.640
 - And her boyfriend looked at him and was like,

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:27.960
 "Yeah, you're also impaled on a large metal spike."

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:29.200
 And they had to pull it out.

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.440
 - Oh, God, and also there are the mad details

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.080
 that she's covered in blood, obviously.

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:35.400
 But then someone, who they speculated

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:36.600
 was probably a house painter,

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:41.000
 was carrying a big box of gold paint, sparkly gold paint.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.560
 And that sort of flew through the air

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:44.280
 and landed all over her as well.

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:45.120
 - Oh my God.

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:46.040
 - So she was covered in blood

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:47.920
 with all these gold sprinkles all over her.

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:49.360
 - And then a piano that was being lifted

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:50.880
 into a building dropped on top of her.

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:52.600
 - Yeah, so every laurel in heart.

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:53.880
 - It is absolutely extraordinary.

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:56.320
 It's just really, really kind of broccoli awful.

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:59.000
 So she started painting partly in recovery

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.400
 from this.

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:02.280
 And she's an amazing artist.

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:05.040
 I didn't really know much of her work before this.

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:07.200
 And like frequently self-portraits

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:09.560
 and self-portraits throughout her life, you know?

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:11.760
 And then she met Diego Rivera,

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:13.680
 who was a mural painter.

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:14.520
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:15.360
 Incredibly famous.

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:16.200
 - Incredibly famous.

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:19.240
 - Much older than her, like 20 years of senior.

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.320
 - Yeah. - Twice her age.

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:21.160
 - Twice her age.

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:22.160
 She'd been married twice before.

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:24.640
 His doctor had told him he was unfit for monogamy

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:25.760
 as a diagnosis.

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:26.600
 - Is he?

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:28.400
 (laughing)

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:29.720
 - Oh, you look like you're out with the doctor

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:31.800
 when you book that GP appointment.

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:33.960
 - I just know that when you book a doctor's appointment

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:35.560
 in the UK, I don't know if it's for everyone,

00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:36.880
 but I have to go on a website

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:39.000
 and I have to click all the things that are wrong with me.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:39.840
 - Me too.

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:43.320
 - And monogamy has never been one of the checkmasters.

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:45.400
 - Did he have that as like, you know, if he got caught,

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.840
 he would show that note to his partner.

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:50.120
 And just saying, I think he did get caught a lot.

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:51.600
 I mean, he had so many affairs.

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:52.600
 - Yeah, so did she.

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:53.440
 - Yeah.

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:55.200
 - Well, she made a tortoise out of him.

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:57.000
 I'll tell you that much.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.160
 But he also made a tortoise out of her a lot.

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:00.800
 - So what's the making the tortoise?

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:02.280
 - We're in Northern China, I know.

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:04.560
 - Sorry, I forgot that bit.

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:06.560
 - Her sister he hadn't affair with?

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:07.400
 - Yeah.

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:08.360
 - God's sake, Diego.

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:10.160
 - Well, they had a very interesting setup though.

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.040
 When they moved into their marital house,

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:16.280
 weirdly, it was two houses connected by a rooftop bridge.

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:18.640
 And so he had his studio in one of them.

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:20.440
 She had her studio in the other,

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:22.720
 but they just had their own pads

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:25.800
 for sleeping with him models and assistants

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:29.360
 and her with just men and women that she fancied.

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:30.200
 - And Leon Trotsky.

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.720
 - And Leon Trotsky.

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:32.880
 - Right, the twist.

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.080
 - What a cameo.

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:37.640
 - Extraordinary.

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:38.960
 - I can't get over the Trotsky thing.

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.280
 I can't get over the fact that she hadn't affair

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:42.200
 with Leon Trotsky.

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:43.600
 When he was, you know, he'd fled.

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:44.880
 He'd been kicked out of Russia, hadn't he,

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:45.720
 after the revolution.

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:46.840
 - So he was like a revolutionary

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:48.560
 who fell out with Stalin, basically.

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:50.200
 - That was not the thing to do in the thirties.

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:51.040
 - Oh no.

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:51.880
 - No, no, no, no.

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:53.200
 - All the people in the world to fall out with,

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:54.400
 he was one of the worst.

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:56.040
 - Absolutely, absolutely.

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:57.840
 - And he needed someone to go, didn't he,

00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:58.680
 that we're safe.

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.000
 And actually it was Diego.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 - I'd done it.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.040
 - Spoiler, he was assassinated a few years later

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:04.320
 by one of Stalin's henchmen.

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:05.160
 - Sure.

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:06.440
 - So he didn't find that place in the end.

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:07.280
 - No.

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:09.880
 - But he did meet Diego and Frieda

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:11.440
 and they banged the Mexican president

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:13.720
 to let him into the country and his house him.

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:15.760
 So the president said, okay, we'll house him

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:18.480
 and then they kept him in that house for two years

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:20.040
 and their affair was very short.

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:22.080
 It was just at the start in 1937.

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:23.640
 - He was also very done.

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:24.640
 - Yes, and he was very--

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:26.000
 - He was married, Mrs. Trotsky was around.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.400
 Mrs. Trotsky is a funny name.

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:29.320
 I just think that's a funny, you don't think of,

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:31.080
 and is there a Mrs. Trotsky, you know?

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:32.600
 - It sounds like a little piglet.

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:35.960
 - A pig mind a character.

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:38.480
 (all laughing)

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:40.400
 But some of their meetings,

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:43.080
 Frieda's and Leon Trotsky's, they took place

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:45.560
 at the house of the very sister

00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:48.800
 who had slept with Frieda's husband, Diego.

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:49.640
 - Right.

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:50.480
 - Oh, it's messy.

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:52.280
 - His death was wild as well, Trotsky's.

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:53.120
 - Trotsky's?

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:55.120
 - Because he was killed with a nice pig,

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:57.880
 and the guy was a mountaineer who did it,

00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:59.080
 so he knew how to swing one,

00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:01.040
 and he thought I could probably get it in two goes.

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:01.960
 He didn't want to fire a gun,

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:03.200
 because he didn't want to raise noise.

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.840
 He needed to escape from this compound

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:06.080
 that Trotsky was staying in.

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:07.880
 So, but he did it, it went into his skull,

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:09.600
 but not deep enough to kill him.

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:10.840
 So Trotsky was running around,

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:12.000
 going, there's a nice pig in my head.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.680
 Can we talk about the brows?

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:14.520
 - A famous brow.

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:15.360
 - The bruise.

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:17.640
 - Oh, okay, her brows, her brow.

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.320
 She emphasized that, didn't she?

00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:20.160
 - Yeah.

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:21.920
 - She painted it on, she made it up.

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:24.040
 She emphasized her moustache as well.

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:26.040
 She had a tiny little bit of moustache-ness,

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:28.440
 but she really emphasized it to make herself seem

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:30.040
 strong, basically, at masculine.

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:31.080
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:33.840
 - She did really like that sort of,

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:36.840
 she really did push her brands, didn't she?

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:39.520
 Like, she claimed that she was born on a day

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:40.560
 that she wasn't born at,

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:43.640
 'cause it was the same year as the Mexican Revolution.

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:44.480
 - Oh really?

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:45.640
 - Yeah, I mean, three years apart.

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:47.960
 It wasn't like she claimed she was born the next week.

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.960
 She killed her three years later.

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:50.800
 - Wow.

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:52.480
 - Coincidence, it makes her three years younger.

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:54.840
 - But then, of course, like, it's still the case now.

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:55.800
 We're like, Frida Kahlo.

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:58.480
 If you look at all the kind of art books

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.480
 that my daughter's got three years old

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:02.160
 of all got Frida Kahlo in.

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:04.480
 'Cause she's just such a brand, isn't she?

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:06.320
 - She invented an aesthetic that genuinely

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.400
 think my three year old

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:09.000
 would be able to recognize Frida Kahlo.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:09.840
 - Yeah, right.

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:10.680
 - For sure.

00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:11.960
 - Well, they did a Barbie of her as well.

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:12.800
 - Yeah.

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:13.760
 - And the Barbie got banned in Mexico

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:16.200
 because weirdly, they took away the monobrow

00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:18.720
 as part of the look, this iconic look.

00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:20.440
 They made her incredibly slim.

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:22.240
 So the family, basically.

00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:23.840
 - Yeah, it wasn't the government banned there.

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:24.680
 - Yeah.

00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:27.000
 - There was a lawsuit because they didn't want this

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.640
 to be sold in Mexico and they pulled off the shelves.

00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:30.480
 - Yeah.

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:31.320
 - But it wasn't.

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:32.760
 - You wouldn't not have a monobrow out of the Barbie.

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:33.600
 - Yeah.

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:34.440
 - The most famous thing about her.

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:35.920
 It's extraordinary, isn't it?

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:38.720
 - And so Andy, as you said, she did paint herself a lot.

00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:42.480
 So apparently, in total, it's 143 paintings.

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:45.360
 55 of which were self portraits.

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:47.640
 And they're very surrealistic.

00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:50.160
 I didn't realize she was as surreal as she was.

00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:52.120
 There's one, which is called my birth,

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:54.480
 where she's giving birth to herself.

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:58.040
 So you see her head coming out of her own vagina.

00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:00.480
 You don't see that it's her because there's a sheet

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:02.640
 over the head of the person giving birth.

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:05.080
 But through notes that she left in her diary and so on,

00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:09.080
 we know that that was her being represented underneath the sheet.

00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:11.600
 Now that is owned by Madonna.

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:15.120
 We know that Madonna owns roughly five self portraits

00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:18.160
 by Frida Kahlo, two of which we know the names of that one.

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:19.840
 And then there's another one where there's a monkey

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:21.520
 on the side of her arm.

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:22.360
 - And Madonna got that one.

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:23.360
 - Yeah, Madonna's got that.

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:24.200
 Yeah.

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:25.880
 And Madonna has been quoted in Vanity Fair

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:28.760
 saying when she brings people over who are new people in her life,

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:30.640
 she'll show them the my birth one.

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:32.240
 And if they don't like it, she'll know

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:33.720
 that they're not going to be a long-term friend.

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:35.520
 - I feel really sad about that.

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:36.440
 - About what?

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:38.480
 - That I'm never going to be friends with Madonna.

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:39.480
 (laughing)

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:40.320
 - Do you know why?

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:43.080
 - I do like lots of Frida Kahlo stuff, but that, honestly,

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:44.680
 it's a bit much for me.

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:45.520
 - For me, right.

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:48.400
 - But my question is, would you really be honest about that?

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:51.240
 - If Madonna asks, I think no one's saying to Madonna to her face.

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:52.400
 I don't like your painting.

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:53.240
 - Yeah.

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:54.600
 - I think she's like, well, everyone's my friend.

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:58.040
 James is actually the only person I know who might just say,

00:35:58.040 --> 00:35:58.880
 I really hate that.

00:35:58.880 --> 00:35:59.720
 - You know what?

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:00.560
 - You should take it down.

00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:02.480
 - Actually, I didn't really care for like a virgin.

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:03.320
 (laughing)

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:05.080
 - Ouch, okay, well, we can't be friends now.

00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:06.400
 (laughing)

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:08.980
 (upbeat music)

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:12.960
 - Okay, it is time for a final factor of the show.

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:14.280
 And that is James.

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:16.840
 - My fact this week is that actor Noel Gubiemi

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:19.920
 played Hector in the Fast and the Furious.

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:22.400
 Since then, he has played a character called Hector

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:24.480
 in 30 other projects.

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:27.400
 And now, if he's in a movie where he's not called Hector,

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:30.160
 he'll try to change the character's name to Hector.

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:32.020
 - Yeah.

00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:32.860
 - What?

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:35.080
 - He's, is he confused about acting?

00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:35.920
 What, acting?

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:37.440
 - He's found his niche.

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:39.280
 - Yeah, he's a Hector.

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:42.400
 - So basically, this is something I saw in an interview

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:45.160
 with Los Angeles Radio Station.

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:47.240
 And apparently, started as a coincidence.

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:50.140
 So the writers just were looking for a Hispanic name.

00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:53.480
 And they would often just come up with Hector or Carlos

00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:56.520
 because it's like not the most obvious,

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:58.480
 but it's like one of the most obvious.

00:36:58.480 --> 00:36:59.300
 - Interesting.

00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:02.680
 I didn't, so it's like not calling your English character John,

00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:04.320
 it's calling him Michael.

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:05.160
 Do you know what I mean?

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:06.680
 - Yeah, 'cause I used to just get Hector

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:07.880
 just with the Trojan War.

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:08.720
 - Yeah.

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:10.320
 - And I can think of it in a Hispanic sense.

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:13.200
 - Well, it is kind of a popular Hispanic name.

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:16.080
 - So in Puerto Rico right now, Hector is the 18th most

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:20.040
 popular name, which is beaten by Michael Kevin and Brian.

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:22.400
 But in the '80s and '90s and early 2000s,

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.400
 it was very popular.

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:26.520
 So these characters, this guy is in his 30s.

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:29.920
 So his character, people of that age were called Hector

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:32.560
 quite a lot in the Hispanic speaking world.

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:34.880
 And so yeah, it started as a coincidence.

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:37.240
 And then it was noted in an Instagram post

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:39.640
 and it went a bit viral and he sort of ran with it.

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:42.160
 And now sometimes in a movie, he'll get a choice

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:45.440
 to chase a name or keep it.

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:47.160
 And if he has the chance, he'll always say,

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:48.720
 "Now I want to be Hector."

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:51.520
 - Well, he's got a hell of a list of movies he's done.

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:52.680
 He's been in so many movies.

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:54.960
 So Hector's not even the only recurring name

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:56.400
 that has come up in his movies.

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:58.760
 So he's played Jose four times.

00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:00.760
 He's played Cruz twice.

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:03.920
 - So I would say Jose is the straight up

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:06.840
 first Hispanic name you would go to, right?

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:07.680
 - Yeah, okay.

00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:08.520
 - No way.

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:09.640
 (laughing)

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:10.640
 - Just put it in anywhere.

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:11.640
 (laughing)

00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:12.680
 - Well, how about this one then?

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:15.720
 Twice, he's played someone called Gang Banger One.

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:16.840
 (laughing)

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:20.880
 Again, that's the 19th most popular name in Florida right now.

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:23.600
 - This is not an unrelated film.

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:25.120
 (laughing)

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:26.480
 - He completely is.

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:27.320
 - No.

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:28.640
 - So when he did it, Gang Banger One,

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:30.280
 he's listed in the X-Files.

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:32.000
 - And that's just a gang member, we should say.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.040
 It's just someone who's in gang fights a lot.

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:35.200
 - Oh, is it?

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:36.360
 - Oh, grow up guys.

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:37.200
 - What?

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:38.040
 - I've never heard of that.

00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:38.880
 - I've never heard of that.

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:41.680
 - He's a Gang Banger, is very common.

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:44.080
 Come to South London, you'll hear it said.

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:45.080
 It's someone who's in a gang.

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:46.240
 It's someone who gets him gang fights.

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:47.080
 - Are you sure?

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:48.480
 - Who plays the drum in the gang?

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.400
 - No, just anyone.

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:51.880
 - Any gang, yeah.

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:52.720
 - Are you sure?

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:53.960
 - I'm positive.

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:56.280
 I remember from my time in the Peckham crew, all right?

00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:58.320
 (laughing)

00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:00.480
 - I remember from my time in the Orgy.

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:01.480
 (laughing)

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:02.920
 We all had a different understanding.

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:04.240
 - So yeah, it's an old fashioned term.

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:06.320
 It's not as much used these days out.

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:07.160
 - That's right.

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:10.960
 - Because I would say probably, my memory of the X-Files

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:14.720
 is there would be more likely to be gangs than...

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:15.560
 - The bags.

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:16.400
 - The bags.

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:17.240
 - Yeah.

00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:19.480
 Well, the other time was in a movie called Out of Sight,

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:21.040
 which is listed on his Wikipedia,

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:23.320
 but not listed on IMDB,

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:25.120
 and I didn't have time to watch the movie.

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:26.720
 - Wait, not out of sight with George Clooney and...

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:27.560
 - And Jennifer Lopez.

00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:28.400
 - And Jennifer Lopez.

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:29.760
 - And I'm amazingly bad film.

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:31.480
 - Well, yeah, he's had so many roles.

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:32.880
 He's been called Snuffy, Chicken,

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:34.640
 Lord of the Garbage, Subway Guy,

00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:36.520
 Sam the Man, Random,

00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:39.120
 why didn't he demand to always be called Lord of the Garbage?

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:41.080
 (laughing)

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:44.080
 - That's a Michael flatly dance that I didn't really want to see.

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:45.600
 (laughing)

00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:46.720
 - Latin Guy on a bicycle,

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:48.320
 and that was in the video clip

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:49.960
 for Pretty Fly For A White Guy.

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:50.960
 The offspring is in that.

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:51.800
 - It's in that.

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:52.960
 - He's in that.

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:54.040
 - Yeah, very good.

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:55.400
 - Character names are funny, are they?

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:56.240
 - Kambi.

00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:59.200
 - Often, they express something about the character.

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:01.000
 - Yeah, like some writers will,

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.400
 as soon as you see a character's name,

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:04.280
 you'll know exactly what they do.

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:06.520
 Like Dickens, for instance, called JK Rowling.

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:07.360
 - Exactly.

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:08.360
 - But then other ones,

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:10.440
 they would just call themselves Jack Reacher,

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:11.520
 and you don't know what that is.

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:13.120
 It's just a person called Jack.

00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:13.960
 - Exactly.

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:15.080
 And so the Dickens character's,

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:16.560
 and they're called Crathillic Names,

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:17.800
 which I didn't know.

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:20.120
 They dates back to Platonic Dialogue.

00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:21.480
 So there's a Platonic Dialogue,

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:22.480
 which is all about,

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:24.040
 is your name relevant to your character.

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:26.720
 And so when Dickens has Mr. Bumble,

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:28.000
 or Mr. Murd Stone,

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.800
 who's a tough, hard character,

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:30.640
 that just...

00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:32.080
 - Who's the Mr. Chokam,

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:34.480
 something in... - Chokam Child.

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:35.320
 - Chokam Child.

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:36.160
 - Yeah.

00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:37.920
 - That's a really rubbish one.

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:40.480
 But so there's this story about Dickens

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:42.120
 that Tiny Tim was allegedly going to be called

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:44.000
 Puny Pete at one point.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.800
 And it's, I have been trying to nail this

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:48.120
 because I don't think it's actually true.

00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:52.360
 Like there's this piece from Dickens Quarterly in 1995,

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:54.800
 which says actually this might be from an advert,

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:56.120
 'cause there was an advert which said,

00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:58.000
 little Larry, small Sam, Puny Pete,

00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:58.880
 they were all crossed out,

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:00.560
 and then below it it says Tiny Tim.

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:01.400
 - Not crossed out.

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:02.240
 - Not crossed out.

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:03.880
 And it's saying like, sometimes you have to iterate

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:05.000
 and go through a few versions

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:05.840
 before you get the final thing.

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:06.840
 So that might be,

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:07.960
 that's a common internet factoid

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:09.400
 that actually might not be.

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:10.440
 - It's one of my favourite things we do

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:11.760
 is explode misconceptions

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:13.480
 that only two people had.

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:16.120
 Those two people will be listeners.

00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:16.960
 So it's good.

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:22.720
 - This guy, Hector, arguably is Typecast.

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:26.480
 He's doing quite similar characters in all these things.

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:31.480
 IMDB has a category of the most Typecast actors in the world

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:34.640
 and it explains the kind of character that they do.

00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:38.000
 So I want to do a quiz where I'll give you the explanation

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.880
 of the character and you have to say the name of the actor

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:42.160
 that they're describing.

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:44.280
 So easy one to start off with.

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:46.800
 Neurotic, sex-obsessed, intellectual.

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:47.800
 - Woody Allen.

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:49.120
 - Straight in there.

00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:51.840
 If at home you got that quicker than Dan and Andy Weldon.

00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:56.280
 Greasy, weasily, slightly mental creep.

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:57.480
 - That's Dan, isn't it?

00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:00.200
 That's, he didn't do much acting.

00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:01.960
 - I've got that one credit.

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:02.960
 Gang banger too.

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:07.080
 - Alan Whitman?

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:09.960
 - No, Greasy Weasily, slightly mental creep.

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:11.880
 - And when I tell you, you'll go, oh yeah.

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:13.320
 - Okay, hang on a sec.

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:16.080
 - Oh, no, I can picture him on my head, stupid Chevy.

00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:17.960
 - Correct, that's who I was going for as well.

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:19.880
 - Yes, okay, well done, Andy and me.

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:25.680
 - Offbeat quirky hipster who's a little stuck

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:26.920
 in Dreamland.

00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:27.920
 - Michael Sarah?

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:29.240
 - No, it's.

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:30.680
 - Ah, that annoying woman.

00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:31.680
 - Yeah.

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:32.680
 God.

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:34.160
 - I need to pick the mom in Paddington.

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:35.000
 - I mean Sally Hawkins.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.080
 - Sally Hawkins.

00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:37.560
 - Oh, no, it's not her.

00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:38.400
 - Is it a woman?

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:39.400
 - It's a woman.

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:41.200
 - Offbeat, say it again.

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:43.800
 - Offbeat quirky hipster who's a little stuck in Dreamland.

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:44.640
 I'll tell you this one.

00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:45.480
 - Is it Woody Deschanel?

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:46.320
 - It's correct.

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:47.160
 - Yes.

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:48.240
 - I don't know what that is.

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:50.920
 - A tough woman who eventually shows vulnerability

00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:53.040
 by breaking down in a crying scene.

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:54.120
 - Sigourney Weaver?

00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:55.440
 - She doesn't break down in crying scenes.

00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:56.280
 - She breaks others.

00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:58.200
 - Mell Street.

00:42:58.200 --> 00:42:59.040
 - Who's he saying?

00:42:59.040 --> 00:42:59.880
 - Mell Street.

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:00.720
 - Mell Street.

00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:02.200
 - No, we're kind of getting there.

00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:03.040
 - Julia Roberts.

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:03.880
 - Correct.

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:04.720
 - Oh.

00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:06.120
 - He's back in the game.

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:07.680
 - Is she a tough woman?

00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:08.520
 - Yeah.

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:09.360
 - Okay.

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:11.760
 - Finally in this quiz, immature man child.

00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:12.600
 - Adam Sandler.

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:13.440
 - Correct.

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:16.440
 (all laughing)

00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:17.280
 - It's good.

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:18.120
 - Oh, sorry guys.

00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:19.120
 - That's quite striking.

00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:19.960
 - No, it's very good.

00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:21.200
 - Oh, clearly they come across.

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:24.360
 - So the tight casting is so dangerous for actors.

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:26.200
 - There's an ed O'Neill.

00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:28.200
 There used to be a sitcom married with children.

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:29.360
 If you can't picture him from that,

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:32.120
 he was in that, he's in modern family as well

00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:34.880
 as one of the husbands in it.

00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:37.120
 - It was like a long suffering husband.

00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:39.160
 - Yeah, incredibly funny to the point

00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:41.840
 where he almost just had to shrug and people would laugh.

00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:44.600
 And so he was in a movie called Flight of the Intruder,

00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:46.680
 Drama Movie, 1991 it came out.

00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:48.520
 Test audiences kept on laughing.

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:50.840
 Anytime he came on screen or did any movement

00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:52.200
 that he was just cut from the film.

00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:53.040
 - Wow.

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:54.360
 - They were like, you're ruining the film.

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:55.200
 You're too funny.

00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:56.560
 You're too funny at the moment.

00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:57.400
 - That's tough.

00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:58.240
 - That's the tight casting.

00:43:58.240 --> 00:43:59.600
 It isn't real thing, isn't it?

00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:02.200
 So there's an actor called Mikael Gillavani

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:06.240
 who played Stalin in 12 different films

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:08.480
 made during Stalin's lifetime.

00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:10.480
 And then the work did dry up.

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:12.280
 (all laughing)

00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:14.080
 - Why are we gonna get a job now at Leaves

00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:15.080
 in the right country?

00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:16.560
 - Yeah, I read about him.

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:20.240
 He basically played Stalin in one movie

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:22.360
 and Stalin really, really liked him

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:25.320
 because he was by far the most handsome and tallest

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:27.480
 member of the cast and he was playing Stalin.

00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:30.960
 And Stalin was like, that's exactly who should be playing me.

00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:32.160
 And then from then on, yeah,

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:34.920
 he was like, this guy is gonna play me all the time.

00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:36.480
 And obviously there were quite a few movies

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:37.600
 about Stalin made.

00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:38.440
 - Yes.

00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:39.280
 - And when the casting call comes in,

00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:41.680
 it must be a tricky, like, do you wanna take this job?

00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:42.800
 - It is time casting me.

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:44.560
 - But I'll be killed if I don't do it.

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:47.120
 - But yeah, then after Chris Chev did that speech

00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:49.880
 that said to Stalin was a wanker, then no more.

00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:53.840
 - No, James Doohan had a horrible one.

00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:56.680
 James Doohan was scotty in Star Trek.

00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:58.320
 So he was the guy who would fix things.

00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:00.160
 He had a Scottish accent.

00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:02.520
 He kept not getting films off the back of it

00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:05.080
 because they kept saying, we don't need a Scottish guy

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:06.240
 in this movie.

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:08.680
 He was Canadian, that was just an accent.

00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:11.320
 But he was so tight cast to that character

00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:12.920
 that yeah, he lost roles.

00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:16.640
 - I was told, did you guys read about Jagdish Raj Kuranah,

00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:19.120
 who's a, he's got Guinness World Record,

00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:21.960
 he's a body with actor, he was, he died in 2013.

00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:23.920
 He's got a Guinness World Record

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:26.200
 for being the most tight cast actor.

00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:30.080
 And he played the role of a police inspector in 144 films.

00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:30.920
 - Wow.

00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:35.160
 - Which is just, and I looked at his whole Wikipedia list of films.

00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:36.880
 And God, he worked hard.

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:39.680
 Small bit parters were bloody hard.

00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:41.040
 They do about 10 films a year.

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:43.160
 So he also played a doctor 10 times.

00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:45.040
 And he had various ones where you'd think maybe

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:46.360
 he wasn't gonna be a policeman,

00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:50.720
 like a film called 'Soo Hog' and he's visiting a brothel

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:52.400
 and he's a bit of an underworld character.

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:53.480
 - Bicking up a gang wanger.

00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:54.320
 - Exactly.

00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:57.080
 - He's doing some gang banging undercover cop.

00:45:57.080 --> 00:45:57.920
 There we go.

00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:59.000
 - That's good.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.280
 - But if you know the actor, you will know

00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:01.520
 he will turn out to be a cop, right?

00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:02.680
 - Yeah, you're so right, that ruins it.

00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:07.000
 - Yeah, I read that he had his own police uniform

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.360
 that he used to keep up, 'cause he was gonna be a policeman

00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:10.880
 so often in his movies.

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:13.120
 And he has his son called Bobby.

00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:14.800
 - Oh, no.

00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:15.640
 - Nice.

00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:16.640
 - Lovely stuff.

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:18.920
 - You know how Jack Reacher, the character, got his name?

00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:22.920
 'Cause Lee Child chose his pen name

00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:24.640
 because it would be between Raymond Chanber

00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:26.880
 and Agatha Christie is the story, okay?

00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:30.080
 But Jack Reacher, the character, is named

00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:32.400
 because he's good at reaching things.

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:34.680
 So Lee Child is very tall, right?

00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:35.920
 That is true.

00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:37.160
 And he started writing these books

00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:38.240
 during a period of unemployment.

00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:40.040
 He used to be like a 90 feet floor manager, I think.

00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:43.080
 And he was sacked from that job and started writing.

00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:44.720
 But during that period where he was unemployed,

00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:46.200
 when he was in the supermarket,

00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:47.880
 or little odd ladies would sometimes say,

00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:50.000
 "Can you reach that thing for me down?"

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.080
 And his wife used to tease him,

00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:53.320
 saying, "Maybe you could get a job as being a Reacher."

00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:56.400
 And he's since turned that into a globe straddling

00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:58.440
 like the cultural empire of--

00:46:58.440 --> 00:46:59.280
 - So funny.

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:00.920
 - And I haven't read or seen the films,

00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:03.640
 but is Jack Reacher someone who's always fitting like bulbs?

00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:04.640
 Is he a handyman?

00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:07.520
 - He's basically like a human Mr. Tickle.

00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:10.720
 - Right, okay, there's so much more fun than they hear.

00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:13.480
 - Yeah, he is very, the character is very tall.

00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:17.280
 - Which was the huge controversy when Tom Cruise was cast,

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:18.120
 because he was--

00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:19.200
 - Oh my god.

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:20.360
 - Yeah, honestly, what everyone--

00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:23.160
 - There's someone who doesn't get type cast as a shartass.

00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:24.000
 - Does he?

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.400
 - Jack Reacher's six, five, I believe.

00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:27.240
 - Is he?

00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:28.080
 - Is he?

00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:30.160
 - Yeah, and he's a tough guy.

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:32.120
 I think there's one book where he stops a bullet

00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:34.400
 with his chest, and that's right.

00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:36.880
 - That's not easy to do, can I just say?

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:39.040
 But it's not that easy to survive it.

00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:39.880
 - Sorry.

00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:42.240
 (laughing)

00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:43.080
 - Yes.

00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:44.840
 - I'm sort of a, I know I'm not used to this part,

00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:47.600
 but I'm astonished that he, specifically a 6.5

00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:48.760
 and he's played by Tom Cruise.

00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:49.760
 Was that a funny joke?

00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:53.400
 - No, the first Jack Reacher film with Tom Cruise is brilliant.

00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:54.240
 It's really good.

00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:55.080
 The second one is also decent.

00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:55.920
 - Yeah, go back.

00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:57.920
 - Do they have very small actors around him

00:47:57.920 --> 00:47:58.920
 to make him look tall?

00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:00.200
 - They cast only bunch of kids.

00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:03.480
 Yeah, and he beats up a hell of a lot of bunch of kids

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:04.320
 in that film.

00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:07.200
 - No, you're right.

00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:09.080
 I think they just show him like he's short,

00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:11.840
 but he's accelerating up towards your face with his fists.

00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:12.680
 - I see.

00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:13.520
 - Right.

00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:14.360
 - Oh, it's good.

00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:16.960
 - It's not mentioned in the movie, his height.

00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:18.440
 It's how they go around it.

00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:21.040
 They don't go, "Oh my God, he's huge."

00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:22.920
 - They don't call him Jack Cart Reacher.

00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:25.200
 (laughing)

00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:29.200
 - Dan, I have a fact that I wonder if you know,

00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:32.880
 or anyone, in absolutely fabulous,

00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:35.240
 internationalist as great British comedy,

00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:40.240
 Jennifer Saunders' character is Eddie, Adina Monsoon.

00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:41.440
 Do you know why she's called that?

00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:42.440
 - Hmm.

00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:44.760
 - Can you work it out if you know stuff about her life,

00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:46.000
 which I reckon you do?

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.840
 Eddie Monsoon is her name.

00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:50.200
 - Eddie Monsoon.

00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:52.240
 - Eddie Monsoon, do you know any about her personal life?

00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:54.600
 - Yeah, she's married to Adrian Edmondson,

00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:56.360
 and he's Eddie in bottom.

00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:57.440
 - Ed Monsoon.

00:48:57.440 --> 00:48:58.440
 - There you go.

00:48:58.440 --> 00:48:59.280
 - Wow.

00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:00.120
 - There you go.

00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:00.960
 - That's an incredible fact.

00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:02.200
 - Isn't that nice?

00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:03.200
 - Ed Monsoon.

00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:04.520
 - Ed Monsoon.

00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:05.360
 - Very good.

00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:06.200
 - There you go.

00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:07.680
 It's a shame that Andy had to get that for you,

00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:09.040
 but you helped him.

00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:11.120
 - Made it all the more exciting.

00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:13.360
 - You two are working as a great team today.

00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:16.200
 (laughing)

00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:18.560
 - So sometimes character names can get you in trouble.

00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:19.480
 - Oh yeah.

00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:23.160
 - There is a writer called Jake Arnett, author of books.

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:25.240
 And in 2006 he was writing a book,

00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:28.520
 and he had a character in it who was a real villain.

00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:30.920
 It was a 1960s cabaret singer,

00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:33.000
 and he named him Tony Rocco, right?

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:36.760
 And the character was a real sleaze bag

00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:38.680
 who preyed on teenage boys.

00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:41.920
 Now unfortunately for Jake Arnett,

00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:44.360
 there was a real 1960s London cabaret singer

00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:47.040
 called Tony Rocco, who was not a pervert

00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:48.200
 who preyed on teenage boys.

00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:49.880
 And he was still trading,

00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:51.920
 having had a very successful hit single

00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:54.000
 and was still performing with a loyal fan base.

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:54.840
 - Wow.

00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:56.840
 - Obviously he was not happy when this book came out.

00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:59.000
 - Was it a complete coincidence?

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.320
 - It was a complete coincidence.

00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:02.840
 He just, I don't know, he hadn't Googled it.

00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:04.520
 - So did he get sued?

00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:06.880
 - There was a legal process, which played out,

00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:09.840
 and led to some compensation being paid, I think.

00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:11.680
 And Tony Rocco, the real Tony Rocco said,

00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:13.800
 "I'm very glad we can just work this out and move on."

00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:17.560
 - There was a famous thing with Peter Kay in Phoenix night.

00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:18.400
 Was it in Phoenix night?

00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:20.480
 So the one that he did before that.

00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:21.840
 But it was one of his sitcoms

00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:24.480
 and there was a character called Keith Ladd

00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:27.080
 who was like a health and safety officer

00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:29.080
 who had sex with dogs.

00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:33.920
 And it turned out that Peter Kayd had previously worked

00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:36.760
 with the health and safety officer called Keith Ladd.

00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:37.600
 - Oh.

00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:40.280
 - And it was a complete coincidence.

00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:41.600
 - Was it really?

00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:43.200
 - It was, says Mr. Kayd.

00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:45.800
 And there was some legal process.

00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:48.280
 And again, I think some, some--

00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:50.000
 - A compensation was distributed.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.480
 - I believe it was.

00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:54.200
 - It might have been the compensation went to,

00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:55.440
 you know, fire safety thing.

00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:56.600
 - Well, dog trust.

00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:58.320
 (laughing)

00:50:58.320 --> 00:50:59.840
 - Well, then there were things within books

00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:03.200
 where people would add the detail of a small penis

00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:05.920
 if they were describing someone so that they would never sue

00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:08.240
 'cause they wouldn't want to admit that the character was them.

00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:10.160
 - Yes, it's not one prime prejudice.

00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:11.960
 It cut out chapter four, isn't it?

00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:13.840
 (laughing)

00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:15.280
 - But if I write a character called, like,

00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:19.440
 Den Tribeur, who's, I write as a really, a real bastard

00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:20.840
 and I say, and he's got a small penis,

00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:22.480
 is that gonna stop me sewing, Den?

00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:23.560
 - What the small penis bit?

00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:24.400
 - Yeah.

00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:27.720
 'Cause it's so obvious I'm making fun of you in the book.

00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:28.560
 - Yeah.

00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:29.800
 - And in fact, this is gonna be a great idea

00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:30.880
 for my next novel.

00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:33.280
 (laughing)

00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:37.160
 - This is small penis coming to it.

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:38.880
 - Well, it's part of the reason he's cuckled it

00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:40.560
 by his Northern Chinese wife.

00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:42.440
 (laughing)

00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:44.680
 Well, I'd be angry, but this sounds so damn good.

00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:45.520
 (laughing)

00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:46.360
 I'm in.

00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:47.200
 (laughing)

00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:48.200
 - Well, you're not quite in.

00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:50.520
 (laughing)

00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:54.520
 (upbeat music)

00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:58.720
 - Okay, that's it.

00:51:58.720 --> 00:51:59.960
 That is all of our facts.

00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:01.440
