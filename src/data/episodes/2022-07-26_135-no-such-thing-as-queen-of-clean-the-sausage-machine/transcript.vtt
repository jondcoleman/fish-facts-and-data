00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.120
 "Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.000
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.240
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.720
 I am sitting here with Alex Bell, Andy Murray and Anna Chazinski and once again we have gathered

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.280
 around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.000
 order, here we go, starting with you, Andy.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.240
 My fact is that scientists have developed barcodes for zebras.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.000
 Hmm, no zebras.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.240
 They've also developed a separate and identical system for zebras.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.720
 We should get on to how to say the name of the thing in a bit.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.160
 But this is a team of scientists at Princeton and what they've done is this is a particular

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:03.720
 species of zebra called the gravies zebra and it's the rarest of the species of zebra.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.800
 And they've persuaded volunteers to take 40,000 photos of different animals and the scientists

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.280
 have then used this software on them because they've all got completely unique strike patterns

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.560
 and it combines barcode technology and facial recognition software.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.400
 And so you can now identify an individual animal from it, Leven Skiro, who's been on as

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.400
 a guest.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.900
 He has a show in Belgium and one of the games because when you go to a supermarket in Belgium,

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.740
 they give you a scanning gun to take around now so you can just scan as you go along the

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.080
 items and then you hand the scan gun in at the end and then they tally up what you've

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.760
 found in your badge as well.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.760
 So he convinced the supermarket in allowing him to have him and his friends have barcodes printed

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:52.960
 up on t-shirts and they ran around the supermarket like laser quest and we're trying to scan each

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.800
 other's shirts and they had to collect all the kills as it were.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.800
 Very cool game.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.800
 Well I've got three zebras, I don't know where I am.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.700
 It's really, I had no idea this is how it works but each gap and space combo is a number

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.360
 and so each digit is a combination of seven black and white bars.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.760
 So to say one in a barcode, it's white, white, black, white, white, black.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.380
 You put those all together so it's slightly thicker, white and black width and that is...

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.900
 It's kind of like more code.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.120
 Did you read about the guy who invented it and how he came up with it?

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.920
 It was several people who developed it but one of the people in charge of developing the

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.520
 idea was a guy called Norman Joseph Woodland and he was thinking about it when he was at the

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.160
 beach and he drew a sort of Morse code pattern in the sand by doing dots and dashes poking

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.160
 them in the sand and then pulled down those dots and dashes into bars and came up with

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.480
 the barcode.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.240
 But then the developers turned it into the shape of a bullseye so the first barcodes were

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.240
 actually bullseyes.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.740
 Oh yeah, I don't know they took up loads of space, didn't it? So it's actually much more efficient

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.340
 to just go with the long line.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.800
 You know that guy Joe Woodland who you just mentioned, so one of the pioneers, supposedly

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.320
 he came up with the idea indirectly because of the Atlantic City Mafia.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.320
 Go on.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.160
 Okay, so he got the idea when he was at Drexel University in Philadelphia and he was doing

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.600
 a master's degree there and he hadn't originally wanted to do a master's, he wanted to start

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.840
 a business where he made a music system for lifts, but anyone to set up this whole phone

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:26.200
 and his father said no, the mob controlled the music it lifts you in Atlantic City or on

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.120
 the east coast of the USA, you're not allowed to go into that because they'll get you.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.960
 So instead he went off and did a master's and came up with a barcode instead.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.000
 Oh, a weird industry to decide to control if you're a mafia.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.680
 I think they have a whole range.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.120
 It wasn't just lift music that they controlled.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.560
 That feels like it was really like the mobster's baby brother, they needed to give him something.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.720
 Have you seen that in Venezuela's supermarkets since last year you've had to scan in your

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.040
 thinker prints to get to buy anything because so you know Venezuela is going through a very

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.200
 horrible time at the moment and there's a lot of food shortages and so the governments

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.800
 had to ration stuff and people have been panic buying things like they'll just buy in

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.880
 loads of grain or loads of cigarettes or whatever it is that I think the country is going

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.120
 to run out of and so in order to stop them doing that, supermarkets have installed fingerprint

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.840
 scanners and when you buy something you have to provide ID, you have to give your name, your

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.040
 address, your date of birth and you have to scan in your fingerprints so they can make

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.360
 sure that you haven't been over buying.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.360
 Whoa.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.400
 If you just want a loaf of bread.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.400
 I was looking into other animals with codes on so in 2010 farmers in some of the painted

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.320
 QR codes onto their cows so that to try and raise awareness of their website this is

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.560
 dairyfarming.com, well, it's worked.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.560
 My God, best website ever.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.080
 I spent all afternoon on it.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.080
 It's really good.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.760
 There's videos of a new dairy farm technology, there's a farmer's dairy diary, I quite like

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:47.760
 dairy reader.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.760
 Yeah, I did.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.520
 There's a cow of the month as well, a little profile in the cow of the month.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.960
 And there's like what it's like to live as a cow and you can follow the journey of milk.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:55.960
 It's a really good site, genuine.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:56.960
 He'd recommend it.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.200
 So the cows are rising the diary?

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.200
 No.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.200
 The cows went to the videos.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.120
 They put, they put cameras on the cows and then the cows go around and make videos.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.120
 What did they make videos?

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.120
 What the cow...

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.760
 They didn't like edit the drives, so I thought they just gave a cow video camera.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:10.760
 They did that research.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.280
 Did you see, there's a small island.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.200
 I can't remember where it is, but they Google Street View has not got to them yet and they're

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.280
 quite furious because they've learned that Google Street View is a fantastic way about

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.600
 getting tourism because a lot of people just go, "Wow, this place looks amazing.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.600
 We should go."

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.560
 So they've attached cameras, their own cameras, to the heads of sheep and goats and they just

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.440
 have them walk through and they've been taking photos.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.240
 So there's whole islands being mapped by sheep now.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.680
 But all sheep do is eat grass, so presumably all you're seeing is this place is full of

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.680
 grass.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.680
 That's true.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.680
 We're close-ups of grass.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.680
 And also sheep farmers.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.320
 So you're just going to get a lot of the same pictures, just a lot of sheep's bottoms and

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.320
 grass.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.320
 And tourism has plummeted.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.000
 They're also naturally low down, as well, on the...

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 Yeah.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 It's not practical.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 They're...

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 Yeah.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.240
 Also on barcodes, embryos are going to get them.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.800
 They're developing these at the moment and this is to stop baby swap disasters, because

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.960
 you know, there are always a few news stories every year where people end up with the wrong

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:08.960
 baby.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.360
 But the barcode doesn't go on the embryo.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.360
 It goes on the egg.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.360
 One goes...

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.360
 It goes on the egg or on the sperm.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.360
 On the actual...

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.360
 Wow.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.360
 Yeah, on the sperm.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.360
 And it's a barcode of sperm.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.360
 Well, they're on it.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.360
 It's gonna be a nightmare to scan, apart from anything else.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.360
 It kinda goes off 500 minutes.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.360
 Yeah.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.360
 Not anyone at one.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.720
 Here's a thing about barcodes.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:36.000
 When they were introduced in the '70s, I think the first item bought with the UPC, which

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.320
 stands for Universal Product Code System, was a bit of chewing gum.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:44.160
 But it was really hard to introduce, because obviously you need hundreds of products to

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.400
 have barcodes in order for it to be worth anyone's while.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.520
 And also, they didn't use to come on the packaging, so used to get the food into the shop

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.320
 and then you would have to stick on the barcodes.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.320
 Ah!

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.120
 The shopkeepers had to glue them onto the boxes.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.120
 Then you could scan them.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.120
 I mean, that doesn't...

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:04.080
 That's not really that weird, because a lot of reduced foods in supermarkets come with

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.080
 a fresh barcode.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.080
 That's a good point.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.080
 That's a good point.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.080
 So, yeah.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.800
 But people were frightened of them initially in the '70s.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.600
 People thought that they'd be blinded, because their lasers evolved.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.600
 Oh, yeah.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.600
 Blinded by the scanners.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.600
 By the scanners.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.600
 Yeah, but you just get them a barcode.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.600
 That's a bit.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.200
 Yeah, but it is quite alien, isn't it?

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.000
 If you're used to someone just ringing up goods at the till, or, you know, a label which

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.400
 says 50p, this weird...

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.400
 I don't know.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.400
 I don't know.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.400
 I'm not frightened of them.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.400
 I'd like to make that very clear.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.400
 It was the '70s.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.400
 We had...

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.400
 We'd landed on the moon.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.400
 I don't know.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.400
 Petrified.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.400
 I don't think witchcraft people running out of supermarkets screaming.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.400
 We landed on the moon before we had the barcode.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.400
 Yeah.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.400
 That's weird.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.400
 That is odd.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.400
 Yeah.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.400
 Yeah.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.400
 It feels like the moon is the landing is the last thing that we should do.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.400
 I'm not sure we should have landed there.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.400
 Yeah.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.400
 Even.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:56.880
 Funny that you mentioned the devil because the universe of product code is part of a big

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:57.880
 devil conspiracy.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:58.880
 Oh, yeah.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:07:59.880
 Yeah.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:00.880
 Yeah.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.480
 It begins and ends with some sort of easy identifying lines, so that the lasers kind of

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.400
 know where the code begins and ends.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.880
 And that resembles a 666 on either side.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:09.880
 No, there is.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:10.880
 There's a six.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:11.880
 And a six.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:12.880
 There are three sixes throughout the barcode.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:13.880
 They're not quite sixes.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:14.880
 They...

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.680
 There are sixes as well in the barcode, obviously.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.760
 But at the beginning, they're just markers that look like sixes, they're not quite sixes.

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:25.360
 And there's the guy who developed the product code, George Joseph Lara, has got a section

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.320
 on his website where he addresses this constant accusation.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.680
 He says, "There's nothing sinister about this.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.000
 They resemble sixes."

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.160
 It's simply a coincidence, like the fact that my first middle and last name will have six

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:37.160
 lasers.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:42.040
 If you'd like to ask me anything more about this, sacrifice a lamb on your lawn at midnight.

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:47.840
 He does say, "I will not be answering any questions of this as of October 2000," or something.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.240
 There's a section on his website.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.520
 Like the video that you remember, "Ringo Star?"

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:52.520
 Oh, yes.

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:53.520
 Peace and love.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.520
 Peace and love.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:55.840
 I'm not answering any more fan mail as of this date.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:56.840
 Peace and love, peace and love.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:00.800
 The thing is, I genuinely believe that Ringo Star gets quite a lot of fan mail, whereas

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:06.520
 I really struggle to believe that this man is just in on dates.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:10.960
 Or if he is, it's the same two mad people and he can just block their addresses.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:16.800
 I was trying to look into how zookeepers identify different species of animals.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.920
 Say they have a bunch in the cage and what do they do to do that.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.760
 Sometimes they have training to teach them the difference between, say, a rabbit and

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:23.760
 a giraffe.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:24.760
 Exactly.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:25.760
 It's true.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:29.200
 It's a better resource to do this though.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.280
 And I didn't find anything.

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:34.160
 But this is the only reason I wanted to mention is that there's a great hashtag that you

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:39.040
 can find on Twitter, which is #ZooKeepersProblems, and it's just really fun because zookeepers

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.320
 around the world just put up their problems.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.640
 So a few I have here.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:49.280
 From yummy tees, I have way too much lemur pee in my hair right now.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:55.560
 From Jillian Erzare, @JillianErzare, punched in the vaj by a tortoise, #ZooKeeperProblems.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:10:02.280
 How slow is Jillian?

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:06.600
 Zebra's caused the most injuries to zookeepers, more than any other animal.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.600
 Are those injuries caused when the zookeepers mispronounced their name so egregiously just

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:11.600
 like Andy did earlier?

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.600
 Yeah.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:13.600
 Because I think that's terrible.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.600
 What did I say?

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.600
 Hey Zebra.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:19.600
 That's going to be the only kind of feedback we'll get about this episode is people saying

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.240
 why on earth does Andy say Zebra?

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.240
 Is it a problem?

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.240
 It's going to be.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.240
 Believe you me.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.240
 Potato, potato.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.240
 Zebra, zebra.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.240
 Yeah.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.240
 Zebra.

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:30.240
 No.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.240
 No.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.240
 Doesn't sound right.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.240
 So why are they injuring us?

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.480
 Because they're wild animals, but people think they're like horses.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.960
 So I think that it's just you're more likely to be injured.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:38.960
 So we're not domesticated.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:39.960
 No.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.800
 It's impossible to domesticate a zebra.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:48.400
 They're really, in fact there's only one person I found who managed to even slightly domesticate

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.400
 them.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.400
 And that was Walter Rothschild.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.400
 Have you heard of him?

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.400
 Yes.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.400
 He is an amazing man.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:59.640
 He was a late 19th century, early 20th century, he was a zoologist, naturalist.

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.400
 He had the most amazing collections of animals.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.040
 He collected tens of thousands of butterflies.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:08.120
 He was a Rothschild from the banking dynasty, the Rothschilds, so he was seriously wealthy.

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:12.040
 He didn't care about any of the banking stuff, all he wanted was to collect animals.

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:18.760
 And he had a carriage, a harnessed with four zebras, and he rode it along Piccadilly and

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.560
 into the forecourt of Buckingham Palace.

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.400
 Oh, I think I've seen a photo of that.

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:23.400
 Yeah, yeah.

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:24.400
 Yeah, yeah.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.360
 It's really for one of these sort of historical photos that gets trotted out a lot.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.360
 Yeah.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.360
 Nobody?

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.000
 I'm surprised that we still have it.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.560
 It seems to be one of those evolution questions that we haven't solved yet of why they have

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:36.560
 the black and white.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:40.840
 That my favourite theory, I just can't believe this, is that it cools the zebra down because

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:48.560
 air might move more quickly over the black bits of skin, which absorb light, and then more

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:53.520
 slowly over the white stripes, which reflect it, which might make little convection currents

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:54.760
 around the zebra to cool down.

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:55.760
 Wow.

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.360
 I cannot believe that is true.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:01.880
 Well, I mean, first of all, I think that God/Darwin is looking down on the zebra debate and

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:05.160
 going, "You guys are overthinking this."

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.640
 So I just thought it would be fun.

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:10.880
 I love the theory that God/Darwin is looking down right now.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.200
 Only one of them will be looking down right now, if they're right.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.200
 No, they're right.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.200
 They're right.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.720
 In fact, it's either both of them are looking down right now.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.720
 Sorry.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:30.280
 Okay, it's time for fact number two, and that is Alex.

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:34.560
 My fact this week is that Agatha Christie was once turned away from a party held in her

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:35.560
 honour.

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:36.560
 Nice.

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:37.560
 I think we've all had that.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:38.560
 Yeah.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.560
 Was she too drunk?

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:43.360
 No, she was too shy, actually, that was the problem.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:49.400
 So this is in April in 1958, the Maustrap, which is the play in London that is based

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:54.360
 on the book that she wrote, became the longest-running production in history of British theatre, so most

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:57.600
 performances ever, 2,200, 39 performances.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:03.200
 And there was a big party in the Savoya tell, and so she turned up, all dressed up and went

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:07.560
 to the party room, and the guy at the door didn't recognise her, and she was so shy that

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.960
 she just got reinbarassed and went and sat in the lounge and had a drink by herself

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.360
 from most of the evening.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.880
 She'd been asked to turn up early, haven't she, by Peter Saunders, who was the producer

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:21.520
 of Maustrap, who said, 'Avoid the press by turning up early, and you can sneak in early'.

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:25.520
 And I think when she did that, she couldn't get into the party, actually, stars it.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:26.520
 Oh, so she did make it into the party?

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:27.520
 She did get into the party, yeah.

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:31.520
 Because I read an account in the British newspaper archive from the stage newspaper in 1958,

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:35.160
 and it was an account of the speech that she made, and Richard Attenborough actually

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.680
 gave this interview about what she'd said, and she just stood up, it was one of the shortest

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.560
 speeches in theatre histories.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:44.920
 She said, 'Well, darlings, I think we'll get a few months out of it.'

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:49.080
 So, yeah, which is weird, because at that point she'd already got ten years out of it.

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:53.320
 In 1972, to exacerbate her shyness, there was another party held in her honour, because

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:56.120
 there seemed to be a constant party's held in honour of someone who was very shy.

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.840
 It's like a form of torture.

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:02.480
 But in 1972, she turned up to the party, and she forgot her false teeth, because she was

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.600
 in her 80s at that point, and so none of the guests were allowed to speak to her, except

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.360
 her very closest friends, because she didn't want to open her mouth.

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:11.400
 And did that cure her shyness?

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.480
 Does it cure her shyness, if nobody speaks to you?

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.400
 I suppose it might do, because then you have to go and speak to other people.

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.600
 Can you imagine you're a shy type?

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.640
 You've plucked up the courage to go to your party.

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:26.960
 You know everyone's going to want to talk to you, and you haven't brought your fucking teeth.

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:29.120
 Oh, man.

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:30.840
 Yeah, it's a tough moment.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:33.080
 It's a tough moment.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:38.520
 So, I was reading the SmouseTrap play when she died the right when over to her grandson,

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:43.360
 Matthew Prichard, and there's been this big thing where he's been in a bit of a fight

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:50.640
 with Wikipedia, because Wikipedia, often whenever they put the novel or anything, they'll often

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.440
 do a really detailed plot analysis of what goes on.

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:58.680
 And SmouseTrap famously has a plot twist right at the end, and it's up there.

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:01.560
 And so he's been trying to get them to take it down, and it's very funny, because even

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:04.800
 on the Wikipedia, they now acknowledge that he's trying to do it.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.040
 But so that he hasn't won.

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.000
 Wikipedia says this is just information.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 It stays up there.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.480
 But it's interesting this plot twist, because it's, it's the plot twist.

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.480
 Hang on, wait.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:17.200
 I'm not going to say it, but the plot twist has become famous for being a plot twist.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:22.480
 And so I for one know what the plot twist is, because of people saying, oh, there's this

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:26.560
 famous plot twist where this happens, I've never actually experienced the actual twist.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:30.640
 And I reckon the majority of people know what the twist is without ever having actually

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.960
 had the twist happen to them, which is a shame.

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:36.280
 I don't know what the twist is, so I'm not going to go on the Wikipedia page.

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:39.320
 I kind of feel like it would be sporting of them to take it down.

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:45.720
 Well, there is, surprisingly, or rather unsurprisingly, on Wikipedia, there's a page you can go to

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:50.200
 with huge discussions from all the Wikipedia and about the attitude they're taking towards

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.200
 spoilers.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.720
 That sounds like a really fun reading.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:57.040
 It's surprised on the Saturday afternoon, but yeah, I mean, it depends on the role of an

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.040
 encyclopedia, doesn't it?

00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:01.920
 Is the role of an encyclopedia to tell you everything about, you know, the ending of

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:02.920
 all plots?

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:06.600
 Or is the role of an encyclopedia to peak your interest so you want to know more?

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.160
 No, I think it's the first one.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:14.160
 To find out what Zebra's really, you'll have to come and see the stage show.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.880
 Do you know how she described herself?

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:20.360
 She said she was a sausage machine.

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:21.360
 Why?

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:26.520
 A lot of sausage party vital difference.

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:30.040
 No, this was at a time of her life when she was writing two books a year.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.800
 She said, I'm a sausage machine, a perfect sausage machine.

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:38.020
 There was one year where I think she wrote seven books, plays, and the collections of short

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:39.020
 stories.

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:43.760
 If anything, she's a mystery novel machine rather than a sausage machine.

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:47.960
 I think it was a metaphor rather than actually describing it as a story.

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:51.400
 And that was all made up so brilliant as an author is she never, you know, she sometimes

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:52.880
 would not literally describe the thing.

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.760
 She was like, I know, but I know it was all those sausages in the leaves, I don't think

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:56.760
 I have all the time.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:57.760
 Is that the plot twists in the mouth?

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:00.840
 Yeah, the lead character is a sausage all along.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:03.960
 It was in the drawing room with a sausage.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:08.360
 I like the idea of her at the press conference where she's giving the interview saying, the

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:12.240
 thing about me is I'm just a sausage machine, a perfect sausage machine and every single

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:17.080
 journalist trying to suppress that snigger, so they write it down.

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:18.080
 Is this the case?

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:22.600
 It's actually saying it without any teeth in as well, that's the reason.

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.720
 Do you know where she did a load of her writing?

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:25.720
 On paper.

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:32.920
 On paper and in a rock, I don't know this, second husband was an archaeologist and a really

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:37.560
 evident archaeologist and she went out and did a load of digs with him.

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:41.760
 So there are loads of stories happen in, you know, exotic archaeology dig sites and that

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:42.760
 kind of thing.

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:47.360
 Or the affair few at least which do and that's why she was a very keen archaeologist, wasn't

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.360
 she?

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:51.080
 In the second part, like she herself got into it as well as her husband.

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:55.680
 She said to her husband there's this sort of famous anecdote where she says, I just

00:17:55.680 --> 00:18:00.520
 wish I knew a bit more about this kind of pottery stuff and he says, do you realize you know more

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:05.160
 about this ancient pottery than any other woman alive in the world today, because it wasn't

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.560
 really studied by women at the time.

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:07.560
 Right.

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:08.560
 You know, it was quite a closed shop.

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:09.560
 Yeah.

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:10.560
 Yeah.

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:11.560
 Wow.

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.840
 If you go to the British Museum, you can see a bunch of artifacts that he uncovered.

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:18.880
 I think he made a particularly important find in Nimrod, which is an ancient and rocky city.

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:22.320
 I found some, a bunch of sort of 3000 year old artifacts and they're in the British

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:25.640
 museum and because she cleaned all his artifacts, you can go and see stuff that's been

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:26.640
 cleaned by Agatha Christie.

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.640
 That is so cool.

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:28.640
 It's not cool.

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:31.400
 So the British Museum says the reason these have probably been preserved so well over the last

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:34.640
 hundred years is because they were perfectly cleaned by Christie.

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:35.640
 They call it the Queen of Clean.

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:37.640
 They call it the sausage machine.

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:39.640
 They call it the sausage machine.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:40.640
 They call it the sausage machine.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:41.640
 They call it the sausage machine.

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:42.640
 They call it the sausage machine.

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:51.160
 I was looking into other people who've been turned away or kicked out from their parties.

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:53.880
 Nirvana kicked out of their own Nevermind Release Party.

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:54.880
 Wow.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:58.880
 And what they say is they walked away.

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:03.200
 It's really odd though because you read what they did when they got there.

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:08.360
 Basically they started tossing around a watermelon and they effectively started a food fight

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:11.640
 and they were told to leave the release of their album.

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.800
 That's a pretty hardcore food fight to start throwing an entire watermelon.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:15.800
 That's true.

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:16.800
 Yeah.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:20.080
 I can understand if it's loved at someone's face that that might be.

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:21.080
 Start with mashed potatoes.

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.080
 Something.

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:24.680
 I've got a fact about parties.

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.080
 There are schools in Japan for how to have a party.

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.080
 I don't know.

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:29.080
 Yeah.

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:30.080
 Cool.

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:32.240
 Because it's not really the dumb thing because most people live in very small homes.

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:36.320
 So you don't really have parties where you have loads of people around very much.

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:40.880
 So there is this group which has been set up called the Home Party Association, which teaches

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:41.880
 you how.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.280
 And there are three levels of certification.

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.280
 First one.

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:49.640
 You just have to send them about 22 quid and pictures of a party that you have thrown.

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:50.640
 Second one.

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:51.640
 Level two.

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:54.800
 You have to attend five hours of lectures in how to throw a party and you have to write

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:55.800
 an essay.

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:57.600
 And that costs about 200 quid.

00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:01.440
 The third one costs about 450 quid for all the training.

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:05.320
 And you have to successfully host a party attended by the examiners of the school.

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:06.320
 Oh my god.

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:07.320
 And get this.

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:08.320
 Get this.

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:09.320
 The failure rate is 90%.

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:10.320
 Whoa.

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.320
 No shit.

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:14.720
 Any party attended by examiners is going to be great.

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:15.720
 Yeah.

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:18.360
 By definition, inviting your teachers to a party ruins it.

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:19.360
 Oh my god.

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:24.400
 What you should have taken tips from is the party of the century in the 20th century.

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:28.560
 And I'd never heard of this, but it's this party that apparently is the party of the

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:29.560
 century.

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:30.560
 It was in 1951.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:35.520
 It was thrown by someone who was known as Charlie, who was heir to some great Mexican silver

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:36.600
 fortune.

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:38.400
 And it sounds incredible.

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:43.520
 And it's been remembered in great party history, great party law, as the greatest party

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:44.520
 ever thrown.

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:48.920
 And so you said a bunch of stuff there that doesn't exist.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:49.920
 Great party law.

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:50.920
 The great party law.

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:51.920
 The great party law.

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:55.920
 The people of famous parties mentioned at every party.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:59.040
 It's great and secretly, it's like the beat of party legends.

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:02.920
 I never, I never throw a party without reminding on my guests of the greatest party of the

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.920
 century in 1951.

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:07.920
 If you guys had attended these Japanese lectures, you'd be highly familiar.

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.240
 What happened at this great party?

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.840
 So this is what happened.

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:14.640
 It took place in the Palazzo Lebia in Venice.

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:15.640
 Oh no.

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.640
 Okay, it sounded good.

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:18.640
 You weren't wrong.

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:24.360
 It was called the Bal Orientali, or the Bal Oriental, depending on which pronunciation is

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:25.360
 correct.

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.640
 So sorry, an Oriental ball inside a labia?

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:28.640
 Yeah, that's correct.

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:29.640
 Okay.

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:34.400
 The host wore 16-inch platform shoes, so he was six foot ten, so he towered above all of

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.400
 his guests.

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:38.960
 He changed his costume 16 times throughout the evening.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:42.600
 And the roof of the place had a garden designed by Dali.

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.440
 And Dali actually did attend.

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:48.760
 They attended and Christian Dior attended and they came dressed up as each other.

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:51.080
 That should have a fun little trick.

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:55.880
 It was a costume ball, but Orson Wells' costume didn't arrive on time, so he had to wear

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:58.280
 just a normal suit, which is very embarrassing for Orson.

00:21:58.280 --> 00:21:59.280
 We came to himself.

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.280
 That's quite a good costume for a party.

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:02.280
 Yeah.

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:07.080
 He should have just claimed he wasn't Orson Wells.

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:12.240
 Daisy Fellows was there, who was a very famous, I think, journalist or socialite at the

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:13.240
 time.

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:16.920
 It was the first time anyone had ever worn leopard print, so she started the trend for wearing

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:17.920
 leopard print in the West.

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:21.920
 It was the first time, you know, a western person had worn leopard print.

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:23.720
 This party is sounding better and better.

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:24.720
 Isn't it?

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:27.800
 So many people threatened to be clear-patterned that it had to be up to the host to settle

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:29.160
 who was going to come as a clear-patterned.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.160
 Right.

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:31.160
 To be clear-patterned.

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:36.640
 It's an anonymous phone call, it's someone who's going to be clear-patterned, your party.

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:40.520
 Americans who hadn't been invited, because it was so famous it was happening, they sailed

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:45.600
 over and arrived in the Lido nearby in their yachts, just in the desperate hope of getting

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:46.600
 an invitation.

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:51.640
 So there were all these wealthy people's yachts, parks in nearby coastline and Lido's, just

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:52.640
 in the hope that they get it.

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:53.640
 Doesn't it sound incredible?

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:54.640
 That's unbelievable, isn't it?

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.440
 But who's Charlie?

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:57.440
 Just a super rich guy.

00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.040
 No one really knows anything more about him.

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:00.040
 That's amazing.

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:01.040
 It sounds kind of great.

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.040
 Gatsby-esque.

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:03.040
 So great Gatsby.

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.040
 Do you know what was the period of?

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.040
 Was that correct?

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.040
 It's slightly late in the morning.

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.040
 Gatsby is 20s.

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:09.040
 Really?

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:14.000
 I'm Truman Capote through party as well, which was to tie in with the publication of In Cold

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 Blood.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.880
 And that, apparently, in America was the big party of 1966.

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:26.560
 Yeah, so it was dubbed the night Capote made 500 friends and 15,000 enemies, because the

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.000
 invitations were so coveted.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.760
 The idea that he was saying no to people to the come to this party created more enemies

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:37.120
 than the people who had been coming, liking him.

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:42.600
 And everyone wore masks, so it was, you know, no one who knew who anyone was there.

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.720
 Frank Sinatra was there, apparently, Lauren Bacol apparently.

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:45.720
 No one knows.

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:46.720
 They had a mask on.

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:49.560
 The only person without a mask was Andy Warhol, who just decided not to wear a mask.

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:50.560
 So arty.

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:51.560
 And yeah.

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:56.080
 That's like when Brian Cranston went to Comic-Con, and he wore a plastic mask with his own

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:57.760
 face on it, no one recognized him.

00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:58.760
 That's really good.

00:23:58.760 --> 00:23:59.760
 Yeah, it's funny.

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:04.240
 Are we sure Truman Capote didn't just invite a few thousand randomers off the street,

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:07.800
 but mask on them, take photos and then point at the various photos going, that's Frank Sinatra

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:08.800
 there.

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:12.840
 Skepticism from the woman who told us this cock and bull story about the greatest party

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:13.840
 in 1951 ever told.

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:19.440
 I don't like being faced with this Capote competition.

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:22.320
 Salvador Dali once said, "I am never alone.

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:27.000
 I'm used to being with Salvador Dali always, and that, for me, is a permanent party."

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:38.520
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Chuzinski.

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:44.200
 My fact this week is that different species of dolphins babysit each other's children.

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:48.920
 So this is some research that was done a while back and reported in the Marine Mammal Science

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:53.720
 Journal, and it's about bottlenose dolphins and spotted dolphins and how they work together

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:55.320
 and they do loads of stuff together.

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:58.240
 And one of the things they do together is leave their children with each other.

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:03.560
 So when dolphins dive deep to hunt squid, for instance, their kids, young dolphins can't

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:06.800
 dive that deep, so they leave them with someone to care for them.

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:11.280
 And these two species, the first instance of species, probably cooperating in this way.

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:15.000
 It would be great if you could get an animal babysitter just for your kids.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.880
 What kind of animal would you pick to babysit your children?

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:17.880
 Presumably not dolphin.

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:18.880
 Not zebra either.

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:19.880
 Yeah.

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:20.880
 Well dolphins are very well qualified.

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:33.520
 If you give the kids armbands and drop them in the sea, then get spotted dolphin to live.

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:34.520
 I don't know.

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:35.520
 I don't know.

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.480
 Anytime I've heard about people with dolphins, you always are sort of weird humping going

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:38.480
 on here.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:39.480
 So I feel like you want to tell the sexy dolphins.

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:40.480
 No, no, no, no.

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.600
 I just, I just, anytime I've read about dolphins.

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:43.600
 Yeah.

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:44.600
 Okay.

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:47.600
 But then maybe I shouldn't be googling those particular keywords.

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:48.600
 Yeah.

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:50.760
 So the wrong section of the library.

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:58.680
 Do you know that dolphin nipples are secret in the, even though they don't know about the

00:25:58.680 --> 00:25:59.680
 secret?

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:00.680
 They're hidden.

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:06.120
 They have these abdominal slits and the nipples are kind of inside the slits or the mammary

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:07.400
 slits they're called.

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:10.160
 And also the penis of the male dolphin is the same.

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:15.000
 It's in a slit and it sort of, it can poke out, but it can retract within the slit as

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 well.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 So it's not.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 How convenient.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.720
 The article title that was called dolphins have scary hand-like penises and did you read

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:23.720
 that as well?

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:25.920
 Well, I did, but I've read a debunking of it.

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:29.600
 But you say, what, what have you, no, I just, they have a retractable penis.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:35.080
 And the idea was that they use it to find things if they're near, if they're near a sort

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:39.520
 of a surface area, they'll use it like humans in the dark, use hands to find their way

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:40.520
 around.

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:41.520
 So it's not.

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:43.560
 I'm afraid that's not quite true.

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:48.440
 I've read a thing by a science writer called Justin Gregg, who's a bit of an expert on these

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:49.440
 masses.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:53.360
 And he's, there's a myth that dolphins have prehensile penises and that doesn't really make

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:57.560
 any sense because prehensile, like prehensile tails, which can be used to grip and grab things

00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:00.360
 and wrap around things.

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:03.880
 They can extend it and they can retract it and they can bend it in different directions

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:06.120
 to help with mating.

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:09.480
 But they probably can't pick up keys, for example.

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:10.480
 Yeah.

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:12.480
 But that's enough to give some directions with that kind of...

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:13.480
 Yeah.

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:14.480
 If you had really tried hard, yeah.

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:15.480
 Oh, so that's not too far off.

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:16.480
 It's not too far off.

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:17.480
 Yeah.

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:18.480
 Yeah.

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:19.480
 So this is an interesting thing.

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:24.640
 They have such control because dolphins, like whales, they have pelvis, because they evolved

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:28.920
 from land animals, which got bored of being on land, went back into the sea, right?

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:32.760
 So all the muscles which attach to their penis and give them this control that left right

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:37.920
 in out, that kind of thing, they are directly attached to the pelvic bone.

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:42.840
 And one side to say it's like operating a trick kite where you pull two strings and pulling

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:44.920
 left and right makes it go in a loop-de-loop.

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:45.920
 But I don't think...

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:46.920
 Wow.

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:47.920
 That's quite a specialized...

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:48.920
 I don't think dolphins and penises can do a loop-de-loop.

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:50.920
 You were talking about the secret nipples.

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:54.760
 It's really interesting how the babies drink the mother's milk.

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:57.200
 So they have a tongue that they can turn into like a little straw.

00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.680
 You know when you kind of like loop your tongue over and some people do that, yeah.

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:00.680
 No, yeah.

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:01.680
 Like that.

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:02.680
 They do that.

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:05.480
 And their tongue has little fingery things on the end that kind of go into the nipple

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:08.960
 and act a bit like a zip, like they kind of latch on to make it a little bit of a seal.

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:11.600
 Because it is difficult, because they're drinking milk under water, so it's liquid and

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:12.600
 liquid.

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:14.480
 Oh yeah, otherwise it would see pounds.

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:15.480
 Yeah, exactly.

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:17.480
 And it's got the consists of milkshake, apparently, the milk.

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:19.480
 And yeah, it lost about five to ten seconds.

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:20.480
 But it smells...

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:21.480
 It smells a fish.

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:23.480
 Probably a milkshake that smells a fish.

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:25.800
 I imagine everything smells a fish in the ocean.

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:27.800
 But can't they only taste salt?

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:28.800
 Ooh, yeah.

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:29.800
 I think it's right.

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:30.800
 Yeah, I think that is true.

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:32.800
 They lost all their other taste buds.

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:33.800
 They lost the sense of smell.

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:38.920
 They used to have it when they were on land and then obviously in water, you don't need

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:40.080
 to smell the air.

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:43.520
 And then the nostrils moved above their head to become the blowhole.

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:44.520
 I just...

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:47.520
 I want to know about the middle of that process, when the nostrils were moving north.

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:48.520
 Yeah.

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:51.120
 If you want to have a lesson stage where they had the nostrils in there for you.

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:52.120
 Yeah.

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:53.120
 The unicorn look.

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.120
 Yeah.

00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:55.120
 It's bizarre, isn't it?

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:56.120
 It's so bizarre.

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:58.760
 You know, dolphins' grandmother sometimes feed them.

00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:00.680
 So, and they employ wet nurses, I think?

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:01.680
 It's underwater.

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:02.680
 They're all wet nurses.

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:04.680
 [laughter]

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:12.560
 There's a theory that the male dolphins can tell when female dolphins are pregnant because

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:13.560
 they take...

00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:15.560
 We know they take especially interest in females when they're pregnant.

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:19.400
 And there's a theory that's because they have care for the seed to use ulcer sound so

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:23.760
 that they can do ulcer sound without having to make an appointment at a sonogram.

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:26.600
 What, so do they see them and go, "Oh, it's a boy."

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:27.600
 [laughter]

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:28.600
 They don't tell me.

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:29.600
 Try not to look.

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:35.280
 I feel like we quite, in Dolphin Eska, that we quite rude actually to look at someone

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:36.280
 else's--

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:37.280
 Don't look at my wife's stomach.

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:38.280
 Yeah.

00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:40.120
 It's like having extra specs all the time.

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:41.120
 Yeah.

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:45.120
 Imagine taking a wife to the ulcer sound and it's just a dolphin.

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:46.120
 Yeah.

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.120
 Be like, "Oh, great.

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:48.120
 We're in good hands."

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:49.120
 [laughter]

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:53.320
 Except they're not, because we have this impression that dolphins are really nice.

00:29:53.320 --> 00:30:01.960
 But some dolphins, some male bottom those dolphins, kill newborn calves, which is not nice.

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:02.960
 Why do they do that?

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:03.960
 They do it.

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:04.960
 It's really grim actually.

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:08.240
 They do it because it frees up the females for mating.

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:12.160
 Because if a female has a newborn calf, she will be looking after the calf for some years.

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:15.240
 She won't be interested in having any more offspring.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:20.360
 Whereas if the males have killed off the calf then within a few months she might be ready

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:21.360
 to mate again.

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:24.600
 I don't know if we would know this, but did they have to do it sort of behind while the

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:25.600
 mother's away on a trip?

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:26.600
 No.

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:28.600
 The mother's on a trip.

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:29.600
 On a holiday.

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:30.600
 Well, baby settings go on.

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:31.600
 Yeah, presumably.

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:35.360
 They just kind of mob the mother, and so the mother will try to protect her calf and

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:39.360
 often will succeed in protecting her calf from the males and get away with them.

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:40.360
 Yeah.

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:41.360
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:43.560
 And then the mother's fine just to mate with that dolphin again.

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:44.560
 They get over it, don't they?

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:45.560
 Pretty fast in the animal world.

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:46.560
 Yeah.

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:47.560
 They've got to procreate in a much time.

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:48.560
 It's not a healthy family situation.

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:49.560
 Yeah.

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:50.560
 It's not.

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:54.480
 Actually, I think bottlenose dolphins might be the bastards of the dolphin world, because

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:58.520
 actually this initial fact was about bottlenose and spotted dolphins looking out for each other's

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:02.480
 children, but the only instance they found is of spotted dolphins looking out to bottlenose

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:04.680
 dolphins children, not the other way round.

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:08.320
 And actually, there's quite a lot of instances as well as them cooperating with each other's

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:09.320
 species wise.

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:12.680
 Bottlenose dolphins will just force their way into a group of spotted dolphins and start

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:15.720
 shagging the women in them, and there's nothing that the spotted can do because they're

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:16.720
 half the size.

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:17.720
 Yes.

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:18.720
 Yeah.

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:19.720
 Yeah.

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:21.720
 So, actually, they're kind of bullies.

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:22.720
 But bottlenose bullies.

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:27.840
 There's evidence in marine research centres that kind of manage large areas of water with

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:32.080
 lots of species in that when dolphins get bored of all the human toys and things that they

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:35.440
 use baby sharks as volleyballs, which is definitely bullying.

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:42.440
 Well, that's how dolphins kill baby dolphin calves, is they toss them out of the water, or

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:46.640
 they will hold them under the water, because dolphins need to come up for it.

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:48.960
 How have you guys heard of a dolphin?

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:51.880
 It's a whale dolphin, half whale, half dolphin.

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:52.880
 It's amazing.

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:53.880
 How big is it?

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:54.880
 Is it a massive dolphin?

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:57.600
 It was in between the size of the two, because it was a pulse killer whale there.

00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:00.120
 I think that's slightly smaller than killer whales.

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:04.080
 It must be so bad for it, though, it's so awkward, like, who do you hang out with?

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:06.360
 You're way too small for the whales, and you're way too big for the dolphins.

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:08.200
 So let's sell it to Pixar.

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:15.200
 Sell it to Pixar, all right?

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:18.080
 It's time for our final fact of the show, and that's my fact.

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:21.920
 My fact this week is that Sylvester Stallone's mum is a bum-reader.

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:22.920
 It's a bit harsh.

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:25.600
 That's no way to squeak of that.

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:30.320
 This is something she is very proud of out, according to her website, which she has taken

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:32.920
 down, and we had to search very hard to verify.

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:36.840
 This is the kind of fact you get when James Hawking is away for a week in a podcast.

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:38.400
 This is what slips through the net.

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:39.400
 I know.

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:41.400
 This is my only chance.

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:42.400
 This is called "Rumpology."

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:45.760
 Why didn't they call it Astrology?

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:46.760
 Oh!

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:47.760
 Nice.

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:48.760
 Yeah.

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:52.760
 Okay, so for anyone who hasn't heard of "Rumpology" or Astrology, the newly coined...

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:53.760
 If it did, those people exist.

00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:57.600
 Surely everyone's familiar with the art.

00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:03.880
 What they do is, "Rumpologists look at people's bums, and they make predictions off the

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:07.200
 back of the creases, off the back of any interesting...

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:08.200
 How many creases are there?

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:09.200
 There's one.

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:10.200
 Do you have...

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:11.200
 Do you have to spread?

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:13.360
 Like, how much detail is this?

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:14.640
 Well, depends how much...

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:16.720
 How far into the future you want to see.

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:19.400
 The future is very dark.

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:21.560
 But yeah, so I was reading about this.

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:27.120
 I actually found out about this because I was emailing an author called David Bramwell,

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:31.440
 who wrote an incredible book called "Number 9 Bus" to Utopia.

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:35.920
 And he's also the maker of a podcast in a live show called "The Auditorium."

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:39.480
 And so he puts on these nights, and he had a "Rumpologist" speak at one of his events,

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:40.840
 and I thought, "What the hell's a "Rumpologist"?

00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:45.280
 Google it, found out that Jackie Stallone, Sylvester Stallone's mum, has done it.

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:48.800
 And she's done it to the point where, even on her website, again,

00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:51.760
 this is quite hard to verify because it's been taken down.

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:56.880
 But suggestions, sort of little echoes of a past website through reading on Reddit

00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:57.880
 and so on suggested.

00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:03.720
 That she used to charge $600, and you would send a printed copy of your bum to her,

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:06.720
 and she would read your bum digitally, as it were.

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:08.960
 I love the printed copy of your bum.

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:10.680
 But how does one print one's bum?

00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:13.920
 Well, now with 3D printing, you probably can print your bum.

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:14.920
 You probably can.

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:17.800
 Oh, I think that was the perfect excuse for all the office parties,

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:20.960
 whenever someone was called sitting on the copy machine.

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:24.400
 No, no, I want to know about my business prospect for the next year.

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:29.040
 But according to Wikipedia, Jackie Stallone has claimed to predict the outcome

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:35.520
 of presidential elections and the Oscar winners by reading the bottoms of her two pet doberman pensors.

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:37.320
 So it doesn't need to work on animals as well?

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:40.000
 Yeah, she's reading animal bumps and bumps.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.680
 And it doesn't seem it doesn't, so it's one thing to send your picture of your own bum

00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:44.680
 and get your own future.

00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:48.480
 But for some reason, these two dogs have the future presidential elections in them instead.

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:53.200
 Sometimes it's just born lucky.

00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:55.520
 Like what are the odds of her having those dogs as well?

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:56.800
 Yeah, amazing.

00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:03.280
 Yeah, Dan, you briefly read out from the Wikipedia on Rumpology just there,

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:05.120
 which is surprisingly restrained, actually,

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:07.480
 and what it says about this ancient art.

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:10.680
 But I did want to read out one paragraph from it.

00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:16.000
 The American astrologer, Jackie Stallone, claims that Rumpology is known to have been practiced

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.520
 in ancient times by the Babylonians, the Indians, and the ancient Greeks and Romans,

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:22.720
 although she provides no evidence for this claim.

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:26.480
 Stallone has been largely responsible for the supposed, quote marks,

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:28.960
 revival of Rumpology in modern times.

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:31.600
 It's the most skeptical paragraph I've ever had about anything.

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:34.200
 I do know it's going in and out of folk as well.

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:35.200
 Yeah.

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:38.440
 I don't even know the ancient Romans would have been in that time or there.

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:42.400
 Just to clarify how you print a bum, because I just feel like people are going to have been wondering.

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:43.400
 Yeah.

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.280
 And she does tell you, did you see what she said you can do?

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:46.280
 No.

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:49.440
 You can henna your bum, and then you sit on a piece of papyrus.

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:52.880
 She says, because I guess she's trying to enhance the ancient origins of this factor.

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:58.680
 So you sit your hen at newly wet henna darts on a bit of papyrus,

00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:01.520
 and then you blow it dry or whatever, and send that off to her.

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:03.880
 And she can read the imprints, just doesn't even need the physical part.

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:04.880
 That is fantastic.

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:07.600
 It's like potato prints, but with your arms.

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:10.640
 It's very skilled of her not to need the original bum, but it's amazing.

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:11.640
 Isn't it incredible?

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:12.640
 Yeah.

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:15.240
 I guess that's what you pay us $600 for, don't you?

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:18.120
 Where do you get papyrus these days?

00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:20.120
 Is that written, is that in Rhymens?

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:21.120
 Is that readily available?

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:22.120
 Yeah, you're right.

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:23.120
 It's hard.

00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:24.120
 It's next to the ATGSN.

00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:26.120
 It's an papyrus.

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:28.360
 Papyrus is really good, though.

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:30.640
 I mean, it lasts a lot longer than our paper.

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:34.240
 That means all the paper from our time of this current bit of history is going to go, except

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:37.920
 for these bits of papyrus that just have arse prints on them.

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:40.640
 Little is known of the civilization of the early 21st century.

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:45.360
 But they accurately predicted every single thing that has come to pass.

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:46.360
 So here's the thing.

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:50.560
 The ancient Babylonians also believed that you could predict the future.

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:52.840
 And they believed it was by the liver.

00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:55.760
 That was the part of the body they thought was really significant.

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:59.600
 But how do you know which bit of the liver means what?

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:01.600
 They had a model liver.

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:10.000
 So you would kill a sheep, get out, get a special priest, get the liver out, and he had a special

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.000
 wooden liver.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.600
 Or there were even some special bronze livers.

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:17.880
 And it says, look, if this bit is discolored this way, then you're alcoholic, and then you're

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:18.880
 okay.

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:19.880
 Yeah.

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:21.880
 It's hepatology.

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:22.880
 No.

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:23.880
 Sorry.

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:24.880
 Not hepatology.

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:25.880
 I'm sorry.

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:27.720
 That is the medical study of the liver.

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:28.720
 It's not a hepatology.

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:30.960
 I think that's going to be the thing that gets most feedback.

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:31.960
 Yeah, right.

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:35.040
 And I'm not getting liver surgery in the next 10 years.

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:37.240
 I'm going to correct it right now.

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:38.840
 It's hepatoscopy.

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:44.560
 And it's a branch of haruspacy, which was the Babylonian Etruscan study of various organs

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.240
 which spelt out your future in some way.

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:48.160
 But yeah, it was really popular, wasn't it?

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:50.960
 A common way of telling the future.

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:57.520
 And in fact, an very famous example of haruspacy was in Caesar, Julia Caesar.

00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:04.540
 So do you know the way the I'd of March was predicted was because of this practice, the

00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:08.120
 beware of the I'd of March, a famous see that Julia Caesar was told to do.

00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:13.720
 And he was told this by a haruspacist who is someone who looks at the entrails of animals

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:14.720
 to tell the future.

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:18.640
 So I think it was the entrails of a sheep, which informed the haruspacist that to tell

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:20.440
 Caesar to beware the I'd of March.

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:22.240
 And that was recorded by I think Suetonius.

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:27.640
 So here's the things, Isaac Newton himself did a lot of future predicting.

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:28.640
 Yes.

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:33.640
 And he was very interested in learning about the nature of God.

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:36.880
 It's so contrary to the modern image of him.

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:39.920
 He devised a chronology of all the great events before his life.

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:42.900
 And then he did a chronology of the future as well.

00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:47.000
 So he predicted a thing called the tribulation of the Jews and he predicted a thousand years

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.320
 of peace are going to begin in 2370.

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:52.640
 And part of it was based on the life cycle of the locust.

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:57.320
 I mean, it was seriously out there, but that's also quite scientific in a way.

00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:00.680
 The idea of taking a load of dates and trying to find trends based on kind of things that

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:01.680
 happen.

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:03.280
 No, that's the kind of thing that conspiracy theorists do.

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:04.280
 It's not scientific.

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:07.840
 It's taking a load of data and making it find the trends that you want it to find, I think,

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:08.840
 or find.

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:13.120
 There is not finding evidence to making future predictions on say, you know, what's going

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:14.120
 to happen with climate change?

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:15.640
 We're going to be based on past data.

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:16.640
 Definitely.

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:17.640
 But that is science also.

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:18.640
 There's good ways and bad ways to do it.

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:19.640
 But it's two sides of the same coin.

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:20.640
 Yeah.

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:26.240
 I was reading about one of Thailand's leading fortune tellers, whose name is Luck Rakanethes

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:30.280
 and he says that the fact that his name is Luck, which means Luck in English is complete

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:31.280
 coincidence.

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:36.400
 There was an interview with him recently where he runs this system now, which is not

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:40.280
 like a cool center where people just literally ring in and they get their horoscopes or they

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:43.920
 get told what lottery numbers to chew or whatever.

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:48.760
 He's a multi-multimillionaire, so hundreds of thousands of people call him every month.

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:52.160
 And the way he did it was, he just memorized a bunch of astrology books when he was a child

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:53.640
 and then regurgitates it.

00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:57.280
 But he spoke to Channel 4, I think, in the last couple of years.

00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:01.440
 And Channel 4 asked him how he finds it, just reading people's futures and telling them

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:03.400
 what's going to happen to them.

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:05.720
 And he said, I want to change my life.

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:06.720
 I'm not kidding.

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:11.320
 I'm so bored of going places with people shouting, teacher, look at my palm, tell me my fortune.

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:14.240
 He's basically completely, well, I don't think he ever believed it.

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:15.240
 But he's now gone.

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:18.720
 These people are all idiots who are asking me what's going to happen to them.

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:22.520
 And he acknowledges, there's no point in asking me if you're going to get rich.

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:24.200
 You need to get rich using your own brains.

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:25.800
 I can't tell you what's going to happen to you.

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:28.520
 You actually have to just go out there and make it happen for yourself.

00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:31.080
 You should sell that device over the phone to people.

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:32.080
 Yeah.

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:33.080
 Perhaps he is, yeah.

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:34.080
 I don't think he made much money.

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:35.080
 Press one for an angry rant.

00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:36.080
 Press two.

00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:37.080
 [laughs]

00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:40.080
 [music]

00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:43.480
 Okay, that's it.

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:44.480
 That's all of our facts.

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:45.880
