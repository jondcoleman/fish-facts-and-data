00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,120
 "Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast

2
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,000
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,240
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

4
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:28,720
 I am sitting here with Alex Bell, Andy Murray and Anna Chazinski and once again we have gathered

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,280
 around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular

6
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,000
 order, here we go, starting with you, Andy.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,240
 My fact is that scientists have developed barcodes for zebras.

8
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,000
 Hmm, no zebras.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,240
 They've also developed a separate and identical system for zebras.

10
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,720
 We should get on to how to say the name of the thing in a bit.

11
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:57,160
 But this is a team of scientists at Princeton and what they've done is this is a particular

12
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:03,720
 species of zebra called the gravies zebra and it's the rarest of the species of zebra.

13
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:09,800
 And they've persuaded volunteers to take 40,000 photos of different animals and the scientists

14
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,280
 have then used this software on them because they've all got completely unique strike patterns

15
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,560
 and it combines barcode technology and facial recognition software.

16
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,400
 And so you can now identify an individual animal from it, Leven Skiro, who's been on as

17
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,400
 a guest.

18
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,900
 He has a show in Belgium and one of the games because when you go to a supermarket in Belgium,

19
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:32,740
 they give you a scanning gun to take around now so you can just scan as you go along the

20
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:37,080
 items and then you hand the scan gun in at the end and then they tally up what you've

21
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,760
 found in your badge as well.

22
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:46,760
 So he convinced the supermarket in allowing him to have him and his friends have barcodes printed

23
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:52,960
 up on t-shirts and they ran around the supermarket like laser quest and we're trying to scan each

24
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,800
 other's shirts and they had to collect all the kills as it were.

25
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,800
 Very cool game.

26
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,800
 Well I've got three zebras, I don't know where I am.

27
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,700
 It's really, I had no idea this is how it works but each gap and space combo is a number

28
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,360
 and so each digit is a combination of seven black and white bars.

29
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,760
 So to say one in a barcode, it's white, white, black, white, white, black.

30
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,380
 You put those all together so it's slightly thicker, white and black width and that is...

31
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,900
 It's kind of like more code.

32
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,120
 Did you read about the guy who invented it and how he came up with it?

33
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,920
 It was several people who developed it but one of the people in charge of developing the

34
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,520
 idea was a guy called Norman Joseph Woodland and he was thinking about it when he was at the

35
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:36,160
 beach and he drew a sort of Morse code pattern in the sand by doing dots and dashes poking

36
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,160
 them in the sand and then pulled down those dots and dashes into bars and came up with

37
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,480
 the barcode.

38
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,240
 But then the developers turned it into the shape of a bullseye so the first barcodes were

39
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,240
 actually bullseyes.

40
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,740
 Oh yeah, I don't know they took up loads of space, didn't it? So it's actually much more efficient

41
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,340
 to just go with the long line.

42
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,800
 You know that guy Joe Woodland who you just mentioned, so one of the pioneers, supposedly

43
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,320
 he came up with the idea indirectly because of the Atlantic City Mafia.

44
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,320
 Go on.

45
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:09,160
 Okay, so he got the idea when he was at Drexel University in Philadelphia and he was doing

46
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:14,600
 a master's degree there and he hadn't originally wanted to do a master's, he wanted to start

47
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:19,840
 a business where he made a music system for lifts, but anyone to set up this whole phone

48
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:26,200
 and his father said no, the mob controlled the music it lifts you in Atlantic City or on

49
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,120
 the east coast of the USA, you're not allowed to go into that because they'll get you.

50
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,960
 So instead he went off and did a master's and came up with a barcode instead.

51
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,000
 Oh, a weird industry to decide to control if you're a mafia.

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,680
 I think they have a whole range.

53
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,120
 It wasn't just lift music that they controlled.

54
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:45,560
 That feels like it was really like the mobster's baby brother, they needed to give him something.

55
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:51,720
 Have you seen that in Venezuela's supermarkets since last year you've had to scan in your

56
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:57,040
 thinker prints to get to buy anything because so you know Venezuela is going through a very

57
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,200
 horrible time at the moment and there's a lot of food shortages and so the governments

58
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,800
 had to ration stuff and people have been panic buying things like they'll just buy in

59
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,880
 loads of grain or loads of cigarettes or whatever it is that I think the country is going

60
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,120
 to run out of and so in order to stop them doing that, supermarkets have installed fingerprint

61
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,840
 scanners and when you buy something you have to provide ID, you have to give your name, your

62
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,040
 address, your date of birth and you have to scan in your fingerprints so they can make

63
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,360
 sure that you haven't been over buying.

64
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,360
 Whoa.

65
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,400
 If you just want a loaf of bread.

66
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:29,400
 I was looking into other animals with codes on so in 2010 farmers in some of the painted

67
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,320
 QR codes onto their cows so that to try and raise awareness of their website this is

68
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,560
 dairyfarming.com, well, it's worked.

69
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,560
 My God, best website ever.

70
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,080
 I spent all afternoon on it.

71
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,080
 It's really good.

72
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:46,760
 There's videos of a new dairy farm technology, there's a farmer's dairy diary, I quite like

73
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,760
 dairy reader.

74
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,760
 Yeah, I did.

75
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,520
 There's a cow of the month as well, a little profile in the cow of the month.

76
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,960
 And there's like what it's like to live as a cow and you can follow the journey of milk.

77
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,960
 It's a really good site, genuine.

78
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,960
 He'd recommend it.

79
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,200
 So the cows are rising the diary?

80
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,200
 No.

81
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,200
 The cows went to the videos.

82
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,120
 They put, they put cameras on the cows and then the cows go around and make videos.

83
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,120
 What did they make videos?

84
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,120
 What the cow...

85
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,760
 They didn't like edit the drives, so I thought they just gave a cow video camera.

86
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,760
 They did that research.

87
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,280
 Did you see, there's a small island.

88
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,200
 I can't remember where it is, but they Google Street View has not got to them yet and they're

89
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,280
 quite furious because they've learned that Google Street View is a fantastic way about

90
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,600
 getting tourism because a lot of people just go, "Wow, this place looks amazing.

91
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,600
 We should go."

92
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,560
 So they've attached cameras, their own cameras, to the heads of sheep and goats and they just

93
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,440
 have them walk through and they've been taking photos.

94
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,240
 So there's whole islands being mapped by sheep now.

95
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,680
 But all sheep do is eat grass, so presumably all you're seeing is this place is full of

96
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,680
 grass.

97
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,680
 That's true.

98
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,680
 We're close-ups of grass.

99
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,680
 And also sheep farmers.

100
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,320
 So you're just going to get a lot of the same pictures, just a lot of sheep's bottoms and

101
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,320
 grass.

102
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,320
 And tourism has plummeted.

103
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,000
 They're also naturally low down, as well, on the...

104
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Yeah.

105
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 It's not practical.

106
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 They're...

107
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 Yeah.

108
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,240
 Also on barcodes, embryos are going to get them.

109
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,800
 They're developing these at the moment and this is to stop baby swap disasters, because

110
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,960
 you know, there are always a few news stories every year where people end up with the wrong

111
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,960
 baby.

112
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,360
 But the barcode doesn't go on the embryo.

113
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,360
 It goes on the egg.

114
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,360
 One goes...

115
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,360
 It goes on the egg or on the sperm.

116
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,360
 On the actual...

117
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,360
 Wow.

118
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,360
 Yeah, on the sperm.

119
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,360
 And it's a barcode of sperm.

120
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,360
 Well, they're on it.

121
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,360
 It's gonna be a nightmare to scan, apart from anything else.

122
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,360
 It kinda goes off 500 minutes.

123
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,360
 Yeah.

124
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,360
 Not anyone at one.

125
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,720
 Here's a thing about barcodes.

126
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:36,000
 When they were introduced in the '70s, I think the first item bought with the UPC, which

127
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,320
 stands for Universal Product Code System, was a bit of chewing gum.

128
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,160
 But it was really hard to introduce, because obviously you need hundreds of products to

129
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,400
 have barcodes in order for it to be worth anyone's while.

130
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,520
 And also, they didn't use to come on the packaging, so used to get the food into the shop

131
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,320
 and then you would have to stick on the barcodes.

132
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,320
 Ah!

133
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,120
 The shopkeepers had to glue them onto the boxes.

134
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,120
 Then you could scan them.

135
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,120
 I mean, that doesn't...

136
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,080
 That's not really that weird, because a lot of reduced foods in supermarkets come with

137
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,080
 a fresh barcode.

138
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,080
 That's a good point.

139
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,080
 That's a good point.

140
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,080
 So, yeah.

141
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,800
 But people were frightened of them initially in the '70s.

142
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,600
 People thought that they'd be blinded, because their lasers evolved.

143
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,600
 Oh, yeah.

144
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,600
 Blinded by the scanners.

145
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,600
 By the scanners.

146
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,600
 Yeah, but you just get them a barcode.

147
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,600
 That's a bit.

148
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,200
 Yeah, but it is quite alien, isn't it?

149
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,000
 If you're used to someone just ringing up goods at the till, or, you know, a label which

150
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,400
 says 50p, this weird...

151
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,400
 I don't know.

152
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,400
 I don't know.

153
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,400
 I'm not frightened of them.

154
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,400
 I'd like to make that very clear.

155
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,400
 It was the '70s.

156
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,400
 We had...

157
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,400
 We'd landed on the moon.

158
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,400
 I don't know.

159
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,400
 Petrified.

160
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,400
 I don't think witchcraft people running out of supermarkets screaming.

161
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,400
 We landed on the moon before we had the barcode.

162
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,400
 Yeah.

163
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,400
 That's weird.

164
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,400
 That is odd.

165
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,400
 Yeah.

166
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,400
 Yeah.

167
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,400
 It feels like the moon is the landing is the last thing that we should do.

168
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,400
 I'm not sure we should have landed there.

169
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,400
 Yeah.

170
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,400
 Even.

171
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:56,880
 Funny that you mentioned the devil because the universe of product code is part of a big

172
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,880
 devil conspiracy.

173
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,880
 Oh, yeah.

174
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,880
 Yeah.

175
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,880
 Yeah.

176
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,480
 It begins and ends with some sort of easy identifying lines, so that the lasers kind of

177
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,400
 know where the code begins and ends.

178
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,880
 And that resembles a 666 on either side.

179
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,880
 No, there is.

180
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,880
 There's a six.

181
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,880
 And a six.

182
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,880
 There are three sixes throughout the barcode.

183
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,880
 They're not quite sixes.

184
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,880
 They...

185
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,680
 There are sixes as well in the barcode, obviously.

186
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,760
 But at the beginning, they're just markers that look like sixes, they're not quite sixes.

187
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:25,360
 And there's the guy who developed the product code, George Joseph Lara, has got a section

188
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,320
 on his website where he addresses this constant accusation.

189
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,680
 He says, "There's nothing sinister about this.

190
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,000
 They resemble sixes."

191
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,160
 It's simply a coincidence, like the fact that my first middle and last name will have six

192
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,160
 lasers.

193
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:42,040
 If you'd like to ask me anything more about this, sacrifice a lamb on your lawn at midnight.

194
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:47,840
 He does say, "I will not be answering any questions of this as of October 2000," or something.

195
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,240
 There's a section on his website.

196
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,520
 Like the video that you remember, "Ringo Star?"

197
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,520
 Oh, yes.

198
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,520
 Peace and love.

199
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,520
 Peace and love.

200
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,840
 I'm not answering any more fan mail as of this date.

201
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,840
 Peace and love, peace and love.

202
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,800
 The thing is, I genuinely believe that Ringo Star gets quite a lot of fan mail, whereas

203
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:06,520
 I really struggle to believe that this man is just in on dates.

204
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:10,960
 Or if he is, it's the same two mad people and he can just block their addresses.

205
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:16,800
 I was trying to look into how zookeepers identify different species of animals.

206
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,920
 Say they have a bunch in the cage and what do they do to do that.

207
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,760
 Sometimes they have training to teach them the difference between, say, a rabbit and

208
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,760
 a giraffe.

209
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,760
 Exactly.

210
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,760
 It's true.

211
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,200
 It's a better resource to do this though.

212
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,280
 And I didn't find anything.

213
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:34,160
 But this is the only reason I wanted to mention is that there's a great hashtag that you

214
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,040
 can find on Twitter, which is #ZooKeepersProblems, and it's just really fun because zookeepers

215
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,320
 around the world just put up their problems.

216
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,640
 So a few I have here.

217
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:49,280
 From yummy tees, I have way too much lemur pee in my hair right now.

218
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:55,560
 From Jillian Erzare, @JillianErzare, punched in the vaj by a tortoise, #ZooKeeperProblems.

219
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:02,280
 How slow is Jillian?

220
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:06,600
 Zebra's caused the most injuries to zookeepers, more than any other animal.

221
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,600
 Are those injuries caused when the zookeepers mispronounced their name so egregiously just

222
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,600
 like Andy did earlier?

223
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,600
 Yeah.

224
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,600
 Because I think that's terrible.

225
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,600
 What did I say?

226
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,600
 Hey Zebra.

227
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,600
 That's going to be the only kind of feedback we'll get about this episode is people saying

228
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,240
 why on earth does Andy say Zebra?

229
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,240
 Is it a problem?

230
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,240
 It's going to be.

231
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,240
 Believe you me.

232
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,240
 Potato, potato.

233
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,240
 Zebra, zebra.

234
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,240
 Yeah.

235
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,240
 Zebra.

236
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,240
 No.

237
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,240
 No.

238
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,240
 Doesn't sound right.

239
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,240
 So why are they injuring us?

240
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,480
 Because they're wild animals, but people think they're like horses.

241
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,960
 So I think that it's just you're more likely to be injured.

242
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,960
 So we're not domesticated.

243
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,960
 No.

244
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,800
 It's impossible to domesticate a zebra.

245
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:48,400
 They're really, in fact there's only one person I found who managed to even slightly domesticate

246
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,400
 them.

247
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,400
 And that was Walter Rothschild.

248
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,400
 Have you heard of him?

249
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,400
 Yes.

250
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,400
 He is an amazing man.

251
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:59,640
 He was a late 19th century, early 20th century, he was a zoologist, naturalist.

252
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,400
 He had the most amazing collections of animals.

253
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,040
 He collected tens of thousands of butterflies.

254
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,120
 He was a Rothschild from the banking dynasty, the Rothschilds, so he was seriously wealthy.

255
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,040
 He didn't care about any of the banking stuff, all he wanted was to collect animals.

256
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:18,760
 And he had a carriage, a harnessed with four zebras, and he rode it along Piccadilly and

257
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,560
 into the forecourt of Buckingham Palace.

258
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,400
 Oh, I think I've seen a photo of that.

259
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,400
 Yeah, yeah.

260
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,400
 Yeah, yeah.

261
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,360
 It's really for one of these sort of historical photos that gets trotted out a lot.

262
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,360
 Yeah.

263
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,360
 Nobody?

264
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,000
 I'm surprised that we still have it.

265
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,560
 It seems to be one of those evolution questions that we haven't solved yet of why they have

266
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,560
 the black and white.

267
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,840
 That my favourite theory, I just can't believe this, is that it cools the zebra down because

268
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:48,560
 air might move more quickly over the black bits of skin, which absorb light, and then more

269
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,520
 slowly over the white stripes, which reflect it, which might make little convection currents

270
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,760
 around the zebra to cool down.

271
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,760
 Wow.

272
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,360
 I cannot believe that is true.

273
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,880
 Well, I mean, first of all, I think that God/Darwin is looking down on the zebra debate and

274
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,160
 going, "You guys are overthinking this."

275
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,640
 So I just thought it would be fun.

276
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,880
 I love the theory that God/Darwin is looking down right now.

277
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,200
 Only one of them will be looking down right now, if they're right.

278
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,200
 No, they're right.

279
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
 They're right.

280
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,720
 In fact, it's either both of them are looking down right now.

281
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,720
 Sorry.

282
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:30,280
 Okay, it's time for fact number two, and that is Alex.

283
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:34,560
 My fact this week is that Agatha Christie was once turned away from a party held in her

284
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,560
 honour.

285
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,560
 Nice.

286
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,560
 I think we've all had that.

287
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,560
 Yeah.

288
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,560
 Was she too drunk?

289
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,360
 No, she was too shy, actually, that was the problem.

290
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:49,400
 So this is in April in 1958, the Maustrap, which is the play in London that is based

291
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:54,360
 on the book that she wrote, became the longest-running production in history of British theatre, so most

292
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,600
 performances ever, 2,200, 39 performances.

293
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,200
 And there was a big party in the Savoya tell, and so she turned up, all dressed up and went

294
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,560
 to the party room, and the guy at the door didn't recognise her, and she was so shy that

295
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,960
 she just got reinbarassed and went and sat in the lounge and had a drink by herself

296
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,360
 from most of the evening.

297
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,880
 She'd been asked to turn up early, haven't she, by Peter Saunders, who was the producer

298
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,520
 of Maustrap, who said, 'Avoid the press by turning up early, and you can sneak in early'.

299
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,520
 And I think when she did that, she couldn't get into the party, actually, stars it.

300
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,520
 Oh, so she did make it into the party?

301
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,520
 She did get into the party, yeah.

302
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,520
 Because I read an account in the British newspaper archive from the stage newspaper in 1958,

303
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,160
 and it was an account of the speech that she made, and Richard Attenborough actually

304
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,680
 gave this interview about what she'd said, and she just stood up, it was one of the shortest

305
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,560
 speeches in theatre histories.

306
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,920
 She said, 'Well, darlings, I think we'll get a few months out of it.'

307
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:49,080
 So, yeah, which is weird, because at that point she'd already got ten years out of it.

308
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:53,320
 In 1972, to exacerbate her shyness, there was another party held in her honour, because

309
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,120
 there seemed to be a constant party's held in honour of someone who was very shy.

310
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,840
 It's like a form of torture.

311
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:02,480
 But in 1972, she turned up to the party, and she forgot her false teeth, because she was

312
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,600
 in her 80s at that point, and so none of the guests were allowed to speak to her, except

313
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,360
 her very closest friends, because she didn't want to open her mouth.

314
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,400
 And did that cure her shyness?

315
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,480
 Does it cure her shyness, if nobody speaks to you?

316
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,400
 I suppose it might do, because then you have to go and speak to other people.

317
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,600
 Can you imagine you're a shy type?

318
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,640
 You've plucked up the courage to go to your party.

319
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:26,960
 You know everyone's going to want to talk to you, and you haven't brought your fucking teeth.

320
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,120
 Oh, man.

321
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,840
 Yeah, it's a tough moment.

322
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,080
 It's a tough moment.

323
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:38,520
 So, I was reading the SmouseTrap play when she died the right when over to her grandson,

324
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:43,360
 Matthew Prichard, and there's been this big thing where he's been in a bit of a fight

325
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:50,640
 with Wikipedia, because Wikipedia, often whenever they put the novel or anything, they'll often

326
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,440
 do a really detailed plot analysis of what goes on.

327
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,680
 And SmouseTrap famously has a plot twist right at the end, and it's up there.

328
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,560
 And so he's been trying to get them to take it down, and it's very funny, because even

329
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,800
 on the Wikipedia, they now acknowledge that he's trying to do it.

330
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,040
 But so that he hasn't won.

331
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,000
 Wikipedia says this is just information.

332
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 It stays up there.

333
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,480
 But it's interesting this plot twist, because it's, it's the plot twist.

334
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,480
 Hang on, wait.

335
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,200
 I'm not going to say it, but the plot twist has become famous for being a plot twist.

336
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:22,480
 And so I for one know what the plot twist is, because of people saying, oh, there's this

337
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,560
 famous plot twist where this happens, I've never actually experienced the actual twist.

338
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,640
 And I reckon the majority of people know what the twist is without ever having actually

339
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,960
 had the twist happen to them, which is a shame.

340
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,280
 I don't know what the twist is, so I'm not going to go on the Wikipedia page.

341
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,320
 I kind of feel like it would be sporting of them to take it down.

342
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:45,720
 Well, there is, surprisingly, or rather unsurprisingly, on Wikipedia, there's a page you can go to

343
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,200
 with huge discussions from all the Wikipedia and about the attitude they're taking towards

344
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,200
 spoilers.

345
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,720
 That sounds like a really fun reading.

346
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,040
 It's surprised on the Saturday afternoon, but yeah, I mean, it depends on the role of an

347
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,040
 encyclopedia, doesn't it?

348
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,920
 Is the role of an encyclopedia to tell you everything about, you know, the ending of

349
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,920
 all plots?

350
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,600
 Or is the role of an encyclopedia to peak your interest so you want to know more?

351
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,160
 No, I think it's the first one.

352
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:14,160
 To find out what Zebra's really, you'll have to come and see the stage show.

353
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,880
 Do you know how she described herself?

354
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,360
 She said she was a sausage machine.

355
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,360
 Why?

356
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,520
 A lot of sausage party vital difference.

357
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:30,040
 No, this was at a time of her life when she was writing two books a year.

358
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,800
 She said, I'm a sausage machine, a perfect sausage machine.

359
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:38,020
 There was one year where I think she wrote seven books, plays, and the collections of short

360
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,020
 stories.

361
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:43,760
 If anything, she's a mystery novel machine rather than a sausage machine.

362
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,960
 I think it was a metaphor rather than actually describing it as a story.

363
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,400
 And that was all made up so brilliant as an author is she never, you know, she sometimes

364
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,880
 would not literally describe the thing.

365
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,760
 She was like, I know, but I know it was all those sausages in the leaves, I don't think

366
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,760
 I have all the time.

367
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,760
 Is that the plot twists in the mouth?

368
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,840
 Yeah, the lead character is a sausage all along.

369
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,960
 It was in the drawing room with a sausage.

370
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:08,360
 I like the idea of her at the press conference where she's giving the interview saying, the

371
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,240
 thing about me is I'm just a sausage machine, a perfect sausage machine and every single

372
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,080
 journalist trying to suppress that snigger, so they write it down.

373
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,080
 Is this the case?

374
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:22,600
 It's actually saying it without any teeth in as well, that's the reason.

375
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,720
 Do you know where she did a load of her writing?

376
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,720
 On paper.

377
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:32,920
 On paper and in a rock, I don't know this, second husband was an archaeologist and a really

378
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:37,560
 evident archaeologist and she went out and did a load of digs with him.

379
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,760
 So there are loads of stories happen in, you know, exotic archaeology dig sites and that

380
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,760
 kind of thing.

381
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:47,360
 Or the affair few at least which do and that's why she was a very keen archaeologist, wasn't

382
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,360
 she?

383
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,080
 In the second part, like she herself got into it as well as her husband.

384
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:55,680
 She said to her husband there's this sort of famous anecdote where she says, I just

385
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:00,520
 wish I knew a bit more about this kind of pottery stuff and he says, do you realize you know more

386
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:05,160
 about this ancient pottery than any other woman alive in the world today, because it wasn't

387
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,560
 really studied by women at the time.

388
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,560
 Right.

389
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,560
 You know, it was quite a closed shop.

390
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,560
 Yeah.

391
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,560
 Yeah.

392
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,560
 Wow.

393
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,840
 If you go to the British Museum, you can see a bunch of artifacts that he uncovered.

394
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,880
 I think he made a particularly important find in Nimrod, which is an ancient and rocky city.

395
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,320
 I found some, a bunch of sort of 3000 year old artifacts and they're in the British

396
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,640
 museum and because she cleaned all his artifacts, you can go and see stuff that's been

397
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,640
 cleaned by Agatha Christie.

398
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,640
 That is so cool.

399
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,640
 It's not cool.

400
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,400
 So the British Museum says the reason these have probably been preserved so well over the last

401
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,640
 hundred years is because they were perfectly cleaned by Christie.

402
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,640
 They call it the Queen of Clean.

403
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,640
 They call it the sausage machine.

404
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,640
 They call it the sausage machine.

405
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,640
 They call it the sausage machine.

406
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,640
 They call it the sausage machine.

407
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,640
 They call it the sausage machine.

408
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:51,160
 I was looking into other people who've been turned away or kicked out from their parties.

409
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,880
 Nirvana kicked out of their own Nevermind Release Party.

410
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,880
 Wow.

411
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,880
 And what they say is they walked away.

412
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,200
 It's really odd though because you read what they did when they got there.

413
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,360
 Basically they started tossing around a watermelon and they effectively started a food fight

414
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,640
 and they were told to leave the release of their album.

415
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,800
 That's a pretty hardcore food fight to start throwing an entire watermelon.

416
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,800
 That's true.

417
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,800
 Yeah.

418
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,080
 I can understand if it's loved at someone's face that that might be.

419
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,080
 Start with mashed potatoes.

420
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,080
 Something.

421
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,680
 I've got a fact about parties.

422
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,080
 There are schools in Japan for how to have a party.

423
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,080
 I don't know.

424
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,080
 Yeah.

425
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,080
 Cool.

426
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,240
 Because it's not really the dumb thing because most people live in very small homes.

427
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,320
 So you don't really have parties where you have loads of people around very much.

428
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,880
 So there is this group which has been set up called the Home Party Association, which teaches

429
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,880
 you how.

430
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,280
 And there are three levels of certification.

431
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,280
 First one.

432
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,640
 You just have to send them about 22 quid and pictures of a party that you have thrown.

433
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,640
 Second one.

434
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,640
 Level two.

435
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,800
 You have to attend five hours of lectures in how to throw a party and you have to write

436
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,800
 an essay.

437
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,600
 And that costs about 200 quid.

438
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,440
 The third one costs about 450 quid for all the training.

439
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,320
 And you have to successfully host a party attended by the examiners of the school.

440
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,320
 Oh my god.

441
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,320
 And get this.

442
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,320
 Get this.

443
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,320
 The failure rate is 90%.

444
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,320
 Whoa.

445
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,320
 No shit.

446
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,720
 Any party attended by examiners is going to be great.

447
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,720
 Yeah.

448
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,360
 By definition, inviting your teachers to a party ruins it.

449
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,360
 Oh my god.

450
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,400
 What you should have taken tips from is the party of the century in the 20th century.

451
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,560
 And I'd never heard of this, but it's this party that apparently is the party of the

452
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,560
 century.

453
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,560
 It was in 1951.

454
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:35,520
 It was thrown by someone who was known as Charlie, who was heir to some great Mexican silver

455
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,600
 fortune.

456
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,400
 And it sounds incredible.

457
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,520
 And it's been remembered in great party history, great party law, as the greatest party

458
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,520
 ever thrown.

459
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:48,920
 And so you said a bunch of stuff there that doesn't exist.

460
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,920
 Great party law.

461
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,920
 The great party law.

462
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,920
 The great party law.

463
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,920
 The people of famous parties mentioned at every party.

464
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,040
 It's great and secretly, it's like the beat of party legends.

465
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,920
 I never, I never throw a party without reminding on my guests of the greatest party of the

466
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,920
 century in 1951.

467
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,920
 If you guys had attended these Japanese lectures, you'd be highly familiar.

468
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,240
 What happened at this great party?

469
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,840
 So this is what happened.

470
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,640
 It took place in the Palazzo Lebia in Venice.

471
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,640
 Oh no.

472
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,640
 Okay, it sounded good.

473
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,640
 You weren't wrong.

474
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:24,360
 It was called the Bal Orientali, or the Bal Oriental, depending on which pronunciation is

475
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,360
 correct.

476
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,640
 So sorry, an Oriental ball inside a labia?

477
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,640
 Yeah, that's correct.

478
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,640
 Okay.

479
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:34,400
 The host wore 16-inch platform shoes, so he was six foot ten, so he towered above all of

480
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,400
 his guests.

481
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,960
 He changed his costume 16 times throughout the evening.

482
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,600
 And the roof of the place had a garden designed by Dali.

483
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,440
 And Dali actually did attend.

484
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,760
 They attended and Christian Dior attended and they came dressed up as each other.

485
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,080
 That should have a fun little trick.

486
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:55,880
 It was a costume ball, but Orson Wells' costume didn't arrive on time, so he had to wear

487
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,280
 just a normal suit, which is very embarrassing for Orson.

488
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,280
 We came to himself.

489
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,280
 That's quite a good costume for a party.

490
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,280
 Yeah.

491
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:07,080
 He should have just claimed he wasn't Orson Wells.

492
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:12,240
 Daisy Fellows was there, who was a very famous, I think, journalist or socialite at the

493
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,240
 time.

494
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,920
 It was the first time anyone had ever worn leopard print, so she started the trend for wearing

495
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,920
 leopard print in the West.

496
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,920
 It was the first time, you know, a western person had worn leopard print.

497
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,720
 This party is sounding better and better.

498
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,720
 Isn't it?

499
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,800
 So many people threatened to be clear-patterned that it had to be up to the host to settle

500
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,160
 who was going to come as a clear-patterned.

501
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,160
 Right.

502
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,160
 To be clear-patterned.

503
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:36,640
 It's an anonymous phone call, it's someone who's going to be clear-patterned, your party.

504
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,520
 Americans who hadn't been invited, because it was so famous it was happening, they sailed

505
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:45,600
 over and arrived in the Lido nearby in their yachts, just in the desperate hope of getting

506
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,600
 an invitation.

507
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:51,640
 So there were all these wealthy people's yachts, parks in nearby coastline and Lido's, just

508
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,640
 in the hope that they get it.

509
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,640
 Doesn't it sound incredible?

510
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,640
 That's unbelievable, isn't it?

511
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,440
 But who's Charlie?

512
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,440
 Just a super rich guy.

513
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,040
 No one really knows anything more about him.

514
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,040
 That's amazing.

515
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,040
 It sounds kind of great.

516
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,040
 Gatsby-esque.

517
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,040
 So great Gatsby.

518
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,040
 Do you know what was the period of?

519
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,040
 Was that correct?

520
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,040
 It's slightly late in the morning.

521
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,040
 Gatsby is 20s.

522
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,040
 Really?

523
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:14,000
 I'm Truman Capote through party as well, which was to tie in with the publication of In Cold

524
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 Blood.

525
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,880
 And that, apparently, in America was the big party of 1966.

526
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:26,560
 Yeah, so it was dubbed the night Capote made 500 friends and 15,000 enemies, because the

527
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,000
 invitations were so coveted.

528
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,760
 The idea that he was saying no to people to the come to this party created more enemies

529
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,120
 than the people who had been coming, liking him.

530
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:42,600
 And everyone wore masks, so it was, you know, no one who knew who anyone was there.

531
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,720
 Frank Sinatra was there, apparently, Lauren Bacol apparently.

532
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,720
 No one knows.

533
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,720
 They had a mask on.

534
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,560
 The only person without a mask was Andy Warhol, who just decided not to wear a mask.

535
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,560
 So arty.

536
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,560
 And yeah.

537
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:56,080
 That's like when Brian Cranston went to Comic-Con, and he wore a plastic mask with his own

538
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,760
 face on it, no one recognized him.

539
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,760
 That's really good.

540
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,760
 Yeah, it's funny.

541
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:04,240
 Are we sure Truman Capote didn't just invite a few thousand randomers off the street,

542
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,800
 but mask on them, take photos and then point at the various photos going, that's Frank Sinatra

543
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,800
 there.

544
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,840
 Skepticism from the woman who told us this cock and bull story about the greatest party

545
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,840
 in 1951 ever told.

546
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:19,440
 I don't like being faced with this Capote competition.

547
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,320
 Salvador Dali once said, "I am never alone.

548
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:27,000
 I'm used to being with Salvador Dali always, and that, for me, is a permanent party."

549
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:38,520
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Chuzinski.

550
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:44,200
 My fact this week is that different species of dolphins babysit each other's children.

551
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:48,920
 So this is some research that was done a while back and reported in the Marine Mammal Science

552
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:53,720
 Journal, and it's about bottlenose dolphins and spotted dolphins and how they work together

553
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,320
 and they do loads of stuff together.

554
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,240
 And one of the things they do together is leave their children with each other.

555
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:03,560
 So when dolphins dive deep to hunt squid, for instance, their kids, young dolphins can't

556
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,800
 dive that deep, so they leave them with someone to care for them.

557
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:11,280
 And these two species, the first instance of species, probably cooperating in this way.

558
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:15,000
 It would be great if you could get an animal babysitter just for your kids.

559
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,880
 What kind of animal would you pick to babysit your children?

560
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,880
 Presumably not dolphin.

561
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,880
 Not zebra either.

562
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,880
 Yeah.

563
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,880
 Well dolphins are very well qualified.

564
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:33,520
 If you give the kids armbands and drop them in the sea, then get spotted dolphin to live.

565
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,520
 I don't know.

566
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,520
 I don't know.

567
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,480
 Anytime I've heard about people with dolphins, you always are sort of weird humping going

568
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,480
 on here.

569
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,480
 So I feel like you want to tell the sexy dolphins.

570
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,480
 No, no, no, no.

571
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,600
 I just, I just, anytime I've read about dolphins.

572
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,600
 Yeah.

573
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,600
 Okay.

574
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,600
 But then maybe I shouldn't be googling those particular keywords.

575
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,600
 Yeah.

576
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,760
 So the wrong section of the library.

577
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:58,680
 Do you know that dolphin nipples are secret in the, even though they don't know about the

578
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,680
 secret?

579
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,680
 They're hidden.

580
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:06,120
 They have these abdominal slits and the nipples are kind of inside the slits or the mammary

581
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,400
 slits they're called.

582
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,160
 And also the penis of the male dolphin is the same.

583
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:15,000
 It's in a slit and it sort of, it can poke out, but it can retract within the slit as

584
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 well.

585
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 So it's not.

586
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 How convenient.

587
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,720
 The article title that was called dolphins have scary hand-like penises and did you read

588
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,720
 that as well?

589
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,920
 Well, I did, but I've read a debunking of it.

590
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,600
 But you say, what, what have you, no, I just, they have a retractable penis.

591
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:35,080
 And the idea was that they use it to find things if they're near, if they're near a sort

592
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:39,520
 of a surface area, they'll use it like humans in the dark, use hands to find their way

593
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,520
 around.

594
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,520
 So it's not.

595
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,560
 I'm afraid that's not quite true.

596
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:48,440
 I've read a thing by a science writer called Justin Gregg, who's a bit of an expert on these

597
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,440
 masses.

598
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,360
 And he's, there's a myth that dolphins have prehensile penises and that doesn't really make

599
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,560
 any sense because prehensile, like prehensile tails, which can be used to grip and grab things

600
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,360
 and wrap around things.

601
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,880
 They can extend it and they can retract it and they can bend it in different directions

602
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,120
 to help with mating.

603
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,480
 But they probably can't pick up keys, for example.

604
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,480
 Yeah.

605
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,480
 But that's enough to give some directions with that kind of...

606
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,480
 Yeah.

607
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,480
 If you had really tried hard, yeah.

608
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,480
 Oh, so that's not too far off.

609
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,480
 It's not too far off.

610
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,480
 Yeah.

611
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,480
 Yeah.

612
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,480
 So this is an interesting thing.

613
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:24,640
 They have such control because dolphins, like whales, they have pelvis, because they evolved

614
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,920
 from land animals, which got bored of being on land, went back into the sea, right?

615
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:32,760
 So all the muscles which attach to their penis and give them this control that left right

616
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:37,920
 in out, that kind of thing, they are directly attached to the pelvic bone.

617
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:42,840
 And one side to say it's like operating a trick kite where you pull two strings and pulling

618
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,920
 left and right makes it go in a loop-de-loop.

619
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,920
 But I don't think...

620
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,920
 Wow.

621
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,920
 That's quite a specialized...

622
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,920
 I don't think dolphins and penises can do a loop-de-loop.

623
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,920
 You were talking about the secret nipples.

624
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,760
 It's really interesting how the babies drink the mother's milk.

625
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,200
 So they have a tongue that they can turn into like a little straw.

626
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,680
 You know when you kind of like loop your tongue over and some people do that, yeah.

627
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,680
 No, yeah.

628
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,680
 Like that.

629
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,680
 They do that.

630
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,480
 And their tongue has little fingery things on the end that kind of go into the nipple

631
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,960
 and act a bit like a zip, like they kind of latch on to make it a little bit of a seal.

632
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,600
 Because it is difficult, because they're drinking milk under water, so it's liquid and

633
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,600
 liquid.

634
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,480
 Oh yeah, otherwise it would see pounds.

635
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,480
 Yeah, exactly.

636
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,480
 And it's got the consists of milkshake, apparently, the milk.

637
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,480
 And yeah, it lost about five to ten seconds.

638
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,480
 But it smells...

639
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,480
 It smells a fish.

640
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,480
 Probably a milkshake that smells a fish.

641
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,800
 I imagine everything smells a fish in the ocean.

642
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,800
 But can't they only taste salt?

643
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,800
 Ooh, yeah.

644
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,800
 I think it's right.

645
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,800
 Yeah, I think that is true.

646
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,800
 They lost all their other taste buds.

647
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,800
 They lost the sense of smell.

648
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:38,920
 They used to have it when they were on land and then obviously in water, you don't need

649
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,080
 to smell the air.

650
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,520
 And then the nostrils moved above their head to become the blowhole.

651
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,520
 I just...

652
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,520
 I want to know about the middle of that process, when the nostrils were moving north.

653
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,520
 Yeah.

654
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,120
 If you want to have a lesson stage where they had the nostrils in there for you.

655
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,120
 Yeah.

656
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,120
 The unicorn look.

657
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,120
 Yeah.

658
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,120
 It's bizarre, isn't it?

659
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,120
 It's so bizarre.

660
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,760
 You know, dolphins' grandmother sometimes feed them.

661
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,680
 So, and they employ wet nurses, I think?

662
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,680
 It's underwater.

663
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,680
 They're all wet nurses.

664
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,680
 [laughter]

665
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:12,560
 There's a theory that the male dolphins can tell when female dolphins are pregnant because

666
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,560
 they take...

667
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,560
 We know they take especially interest in females when they're pregnant.

668
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:19,400
 And there's a theory that's because they have care for the seed to use ulcer sound so

669
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,760
 that they can do ulcer sound without having to make an appointment at a sonogram.

670
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,600
 What, so do they see them and go, "Oh, it's a boy."

671
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,600
 [laughter]

672
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,600
 They don't tell me.

673
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,600
 Try not to look.

674
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:35,280
 I feel like we quite, in Dolphin Eska, that we quite rude actually to look at someone

675
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,280
 else's--

676
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,280
 Don't look at my wife's stomach.

677
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,280
 Yeah.

678
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,120
 It's like having extra specs all the time.

679
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,120
 Yeah.

680
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,120
 Imagine taking a wife to the ulcer sound and it's just a dolphin.

681
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,120
 Yeah.

682
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,120
 Be like, "Oh, great.

683
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,120
 We're in good hands."

684
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,120
 [laughter]

685
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,320
 Except they're not, because we have this impression that dolphins are really nice.

686
00:29:53,320 --> 00:30:01,960
 But some dolphins, some male bottom those dolphins, kill newborn calves, which is not nice.

687
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,960
 Why do they do that?

688
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,960
 They do it.

689
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,960
 It's really grim actually.

690
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,240
 They do it because it frees up the females for mating.

691
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,160
 Because if a female has a newborn calf, she will be looking after the calf for some years.

692
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,240
 She won't be interested in having any more offspring.

693
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:20,360
 Whereas if the males have killed off the calf then within a few months she might be ready

694
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,360
 to mate again.

695
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,600
 I don't know if we would know this, but did they have to do it sort of behind while the

696
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,600
 mother's away on a trip?

697
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,600
 No.

698
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,600
 The mother's on a trip.

699
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,600
 On a holiday.

700
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,600
 Well, baby settings go on.

701
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,600
 Yeah, presumably.

702
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,360
 They just kind of mob the mother, and so the mother will try to protect her calf and

703
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,360
 often will succeed in protecting her calf from the males and get away with them.

704
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,360
 Yeah.

705
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,360
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

706
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,560
 And then the mother's fine just to mate with that dolphin again.

707
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,560
 They get over it, don't they?

708
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,560
 Pretty fast in the animal world.

709
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,560
 Yeah.

710
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,560
 They've got to procreate in a much time.

711
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,560
 It's not a healthy family situation.

712
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,560
 Yeah.

713
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,560
 It's not.

714
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:54,480
 Actually, I think bottlenose dolphins might be the bastards of the dolphin world, because

715
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,520
 actually this initial fact was about bottlenose and spotted dolphins looking out for each other's

716
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:02,480
 children, but the only instance they found is of spotted dolphins looking out to bottlenose

717
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,680
 dolphins children, not the other way round.

718
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:08,320
 And actually, there's quite a lot of instances as well as them cooperating with each other's

719
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,320
 species wise.

720
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,680
 Bottlenose dolphins will just force their way into a group of spotted dolphins and start

721
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,720
 shagging the women in them, and there's nothing that the spotted can do because they're

722
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,720
 half the size.

723
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,720
 Yes.

724
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,720
 Yeah.

725
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,720
 Yeah.

726
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,720
 So, actually, they're kind of bullies.

727
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,720
 But bottlenose bullies.

728
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:27,840
 There's evidence in marine research centres that kind of manage large areas of water with

729
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:32,080
 lots of species in that when dolphins get bored of all the human toys and things that they

730
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,440
 use baby sharks as volleyballs, which is definitely bullying.

731
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:42,440
 Well, that's how dolphins kill baby dolphin calves, is they toss them out of the water, or

732
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:46,640
 they will hold them under the water, because dolphins need to come up for it.

733
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,960
 How have you guys heard of a dolphin?

734
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,880
 It's a whale dolphin, half whale, half dolphin.

735
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,880
 It's amazing.

736
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,880
 How big is it?

737
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,880
 Is it a massive dolphin?

738
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,600
 It was in between the size of the two, because it was a pulse killer whale there.

739
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,120
 I think that's slightly smaller than killer whales.

740
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:04,080
 It must be so bad for it, though, it's so awkward, like, who do you hang out with?

741
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,360
 You're way too small for the whales, and you're way too big for the dolphins.

742
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,200
 So let's sell it to Pixar.

743
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:15,200
 Sell it to Pixar, all right?

744
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,080
 It's time for our final fact of the show, and that's my fact.

745
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,920
 My fact this week is that Sylvester Stallone's mum is a bum-reader.

746
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,920
 It's a bit harsh.

747
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,600
 That's no way to squeak of that.

748
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:30,320
 This is something she is very proud of out, according to her website, which she has taken

749
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,920
 down, and we had to search very hard to verify.

750
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,840
 This is the kind of fact you get when James Hawking is away for a week in a podcast.

751
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,400
 This is what slips through the net.

752
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,400
 I know.

753
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,400
 This is my only chance.

754
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,400
 This is called "Rumpology."

755
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,760
 Why didn't they call it Astrology?

756
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,760
 Oh!

757
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,760
 Nice.

758
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,760
 Yeah.

759
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:52,760
 Okay, so for anyone who hasn't heard of "Rumpology" or Astrology, the newly coined...

760
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,760
 If it did, those people exist.

761
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,600
 Surely everyone's familiar with the art.

762
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:03,880
 What they do is, "Rumpologists look at people's bums, and they make predictions off the

763
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,200
 back of the creases, off the back of any interesting...

764
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,200
 How many creases are there?

765
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,200
 There's one.

766
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,200
 Do you have...

767
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,200
 Do you have to spread?

768
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,360
 Like, how much detail is this?

769
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,640
 Well, depends how much...

770
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,720
 How far into the future you want to see.

771
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,400
 The future is very dark.

772
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,560
 But yeah, so I was reading about this.

773
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:27,120
 I actually found out about this because I was emailing an author called David Bramwell,

774
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:31,440
 who wrote an incredible book called "Number 9 Bus" to Utopia.

775
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,920
 And he's also the maker of a podcast in a live show called "The Auditorium."

776
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:39,480
 And so he puts on these nights, and he had a "Rumpologist" speak at one of his events,

777
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,840
 and I thought, "What the hell's a "Rumpologist"?

778
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:45,280
 Google it, found out that Jackie Stallone, Sylvester Stallone's mum, has done it.

779
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,800
 And she's done it to the point where, even on her website, again,

780
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,760
 this is quite hard to verify because it's been taken down.

781
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:56,880
 But suggestions, sort of little echoes of a past website through reading on Reddit

782
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,880
 and so on suggested.

783
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:03,720
 That she used to charge $600, and you would send a printed copy of your bum to her,

784
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,720
 and she would read your bum digitally, as it were.

785
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,960
 I love the printed copy of your bum.

786
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,680
 But how does one print one's bum?

787
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:13,920
 Well, now with 3D printing, you probably can print your bum.

788
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,920
 You probably can.

789
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,800
 Oh, I think that was the perfect excuse for all the office parties,

790
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,960
 whenever someone was called sitting on the copy machine.

791
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,400
 No, no, I want to know about my business prospect for the next year.

792
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:29,040
 But according to Wikipedia, Jackie Stallone has claimed to predict the outcome

793
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:35,520
 of presidential elections and the Oscar winners by reading the bottoms of her two pet doberman pensors.

794
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,320
 So it doesn't need to work on animals as well?

795
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,000
 Yeah, she's reading animal bumps and bumps.

796
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,680
 And it doesn't seem it doesn't, so it's one thing to send your picture of your own bum

797
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,680
 and get your own future.

798
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:48,480
 But for some reason, these two dogs have the future presidential elections in them instead.

799
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,200
 Sometimes it's just born lucky.

800
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,520
 Like what are the odds of her having those dogs as well?

801
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,800
 Yeah, amazing.

802
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:03,280
 Yeah, Dan, you briefly read out from the Wikipedia on Rumpology just there,

803
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,120
 which is surprisingly restrained, actually,

804
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,480
 and what it says about this ancient art.

805
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,680
 But I did want to read out one paragraph from it.

806
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:16,000
 The American astrologer, Jackie Stallone, claims that Rumpology is known to have been practiced

807
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,520
 in ancient times by the Babylonians, the Indians, and the ancient Greeks and Romans,

808
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,720
 although she provides no evidence for this claim.

809
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,480
 Stallone has been largely responsible for the supposed, quote marks,

810
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,960
 revival of Rumpology in modern times.

811
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,600
 It's the most skeptical paragraph I've ever had about anything.

812
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,200
 I do know it's going in and out of folk as well.

813
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,200
 Yeah.

814
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,440
 I don't even know the ancient Romans would have been in that time or there.

815
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,400
 Just to clarify how you print a bum, because I just feel like people are going to have been wondering.

816
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,400
 Yeah.

817
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,280
 And she does tell you, did you see what she said you can do?

818
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,280
 No.

819
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,440
 You can henna your bum, and then you sit on a piece of papyrus.

820
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,880
 She says, because I guess she's trying to enhance the ancient origins of this factor.

821
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:58,680
 So you sit your hen at newly wet henna darts on a bit of papyrus,

822
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,520
 and then you blow it dry or whatever, and send that off to her.

823
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,880
 And she can read the imprints, just doesn't even need the physical part.

824
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,880
 That is fantastic.

825
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,600
 It's like potato prints, but with your arms.

826
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,640
 It's very skilled of her not to need the original bum, but it's amazing.

827
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,640
 Isn't it incredible?

828
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,640
 Yeah.

829
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,240
 I guess that's what you pay us $600 for, don't you?

830
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,120
 Where do you get papyrus these days?

831
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,120
 Is that written, is that in Rhymens?

832
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,120
 Is that readily available?

833
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,120
 Yeah, you're right.

834
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,120
 It's hard.

835
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,120
 It's next to the ATGSN.

836
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,120
 It's an papyrus.

837
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,360
 Papyrus is really good, though.

838
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,640
 I mean, it lasts a lot longer than our paper.

839
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,240
 That means all the paper from our time of this current bit of history is going to go, except

840
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,920
 for these bits of papyrus that just have arse prints on them.

841
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,640
 Little is known of the civilization of the early 21st century.

842
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:45,360
 But they accurately predicted every single thing that has come to pass.

843
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,360
 So here's the thing.

844
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:50,560
 The ancient Babylonians also believed that you could predict the future.

845
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,840
 And they believed it was by the liver.

846
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,760
 That was the part of the body they thought was really significant.

847
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,600
 But how do you know which bit of the liver means what?

848
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,600
 They had a model liver.

849
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:10,000
 So you would kill a sheep, get out, get a special priest, get the liver out, and he had a special

850
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 wooden liver.

851
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,600
 Or there were even some special bronze livers.

852
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,880
 And it says, look, if this bit is discolored this way, then you're alcoholic, and then you're

853
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,880
 okay.

854
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,880
 Yeah.

855
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,880
 It's hepatology.

856
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,880
 No.

857
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,880
 Sorry.

858
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,880
 Not hepatology.

859
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,880
 I'm sorry.

860
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,720
 That is the medical study of the liver.

861
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,720
 It's not a hepatology.

862
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,960
 I think that's going to be the thing that gets most feedback.

863
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,960
 Yeah, right.

864
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,040
 And I'm not getting liver surgery in the next 10 years.

865
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,240
 I'm going to correct it right now.

866
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,840
 It's hepatoscopy.

867
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:44,560
 And it's a branch of haruspacy, which was the Babylonian Etruscan study of various organs

868
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,240
 which spelt out your future in some way.

869
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,160
 But yeah, it was really popular, wasn't it?

870
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,960
 A common way of telling the future.

871
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:57,520
 And in fact, an very famous example of haruspacy was in Caesar, Julia Caesar.

872
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:04,540
 So do you know the way the I'd of March was predicted was because of this practice, the

873
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:08,120
 beware of the I'd of March, a famous see that Julia Caesar was told to do.

874
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:13,720
 And he was told this by a haruspacist who is someone who looks at the entrails of animals

875
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,720
 to tell the future.

876
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,640
 So I think it was the entrails of a sheep, which informed the haruspacist that to tell

877
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,440
 Caesar to beware the I'd of March.

878
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,240
 And that was recorded by I think Suetonius.

879
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:27,640
 So here's the things, Isaac Newton himself did a lot of future predicting.

880
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,640
 Yes.

881
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:33,640
 And he was very interested in learning about the nature of God.

882
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,880
 It's so contrary to the modern image of him.

883
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,920
 He devised a chronology of all the great events before his life.

884
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,900
 And then he did a chronology of the future as well.

885
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:47,000
 So he predicted a thing called the tribulation of the Jews and he predicted a thousand years

886
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,320
 of peace are going to begin in 2370.

887
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,640
 And part of it was based on the life cycle of the locust.

888
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:57,320
 I mean, it was seriously out there, but that's also quite scientific in a way.

889
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,680
 The idea of taking a load of dates and trying to find trends based on kind of things that

890
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,680
 happen.

891
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,280
 No, that's the kind of thing that conspiracy theorists do.

892
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,280
 It's not scientific.

893
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:07,840
 It's taking a load of data and making it find the trends that you want it to find, I think,

894
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,840
 or find.

895
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:13,120
 There is not finding evidence to making future predictions on say, you know, what's going

896
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,120
 to happen with climate change?

897
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,640
 We're going to be based on past data.

898
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,640
 Definitely.

899
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,640
 But that is science also.

900
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,640
 There's good ways and bad ways to do it.

901
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,640
 But it's two sides of the same coin.

902
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,640
 Yeah.

903
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:26,240
 I was reading about one of Thailand's leading fortune tellers, whose name is Luck Rakanethes

904
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,280
 and he says that the fact that his name is Luck, which means Luck in English is complete

905
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,280
 coincidence.

906
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:36,400
 There was an interview with him recently where he runs this system now, which is not

907
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,280
 like a cool center where people just literally ring in and they get their horoscopes or they

908
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,920
 get told what lottery numbers to chew or whatever.

909
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,760
 He's a multi-multimillionaire, so hundreds of thousands of people call him every month.

910
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:52,160
 And the way he did it was, he just memorized a bunch of astrology books when he was a child

911
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,640
 and then regurgitates it.

912
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:57,280
 But he spoke to Channel 4, I think, in the last couple of years.

913
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,440
 And Channel 4 asked him how he finds it, just reading people's futures and telling them

914
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,400
 what's going to happen to them.

915
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,720
 And he said, I want to change my life.

916
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,720
 I'm not kidding.

917
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:11,320
 I'm so bored of going places with people shouting, teacher, look at my palm, tell me my fortune.

918
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,240
 He's basically completely, well, I don't think he ever believed it.

919
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,240
 But he's now gone.

920
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,720
 These people are all idiots who are asking me what's going to happen to them.

921
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,520
 And he acknowledges, there's no point in asking me if you're going to get rich.

922
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,200
 You need to get rich using your own brains.

923
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,800
 I can't tell you what's going to happen to you.

924
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,520
 You actually have to just go out there and make it happen for yourself.

925
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,080
 You should sell that device over the phone to people.

926
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,080
 Yeah.

927
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,080
 Perhaps he is, yeah.

928
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,080
 I don't think he made much money.

929
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,080
 Press one for an angry rant.

930
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,080
 Press two.

931
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,080
