00:00:00,00:00:19,"""Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast"
00:00:19,00:00:22,coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:00:22,00:00:23,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:23,00:00:28,"I am sitting here with Alex Bell, Andy Murray and Anna Chazinski and once again we have gathered"
00:00:28,00:00:33,around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular
00:00:33,00:00:37,"order, here we go, starting with you, Andy."
00:00:37,00:00:41,My fact is that scientists have developed barcodes for zebras.
00:00:41,00:00:44,"Hmm, no zebras."
00:00:44,00:00:48,They've also developed a separate and identical system for zebras.
00:00:48,00:00:52,We should get on to how to say the name of the thing in a bit.
00:00:52,00:00:57,But this is a team of scientists at Princeton and what they've done is this is a particular
00:00:57,00:01:03,species of zebra called the gravies zebra and it's the rarest of the species of zebra.
00:01:03,00:01:09,"And they've persuaded volunteers to take 40,000 photos of different animals and the scientists"
00:01:09,00:01:14,have then used this software on them because they've all got completely unique strike patterns
00:01:14,00:01:18,and it combines barcode technology and facial recognition software.
00:01:18,00:01:23,"And so you can now identify an individual animal from it, Leven Skiro, who's been on as"
00:01:23,00:01:24,a guest.
00:01:24,00:01:28,"He has a show in Belgium and one of the games because when you go to a supermarket in Belgium,"
00:01:28,00:01:32,they give you a scanning gun to take around now so you can just scan as you go along the
00:01:32,00:01:37,items and then you hand the scan gun in at the end and then they tally up what you've
00:01:37,00:01:40,found in your badge as well.
00:01:40,00:01:46,So he convinced the supermarket in allowing him to have him and his friends have barcodes printed
00:01:46,00:01:52,up on t-shirts and they ran around the supermarket like laser quest and we're trying to scan each
00:01:52,00:01:55,other's shirts and they had to collect all the kills as it were.
00:01:55,00:01:56,Very cool game.
00:01:56,00:02:00,"Well I've got three zebras, I don't know where I am."
00:02:00,00:02:05,"It's really, I had no idea this is how it works but each gap and space combo is a number"
00:02:05,00:02:09,and so each digit is a combination of seven black and white bars.
00:02:09,00:02:14,"So to say one in a barcode, it's white, white, black, white, white, black."
00:02:14,00:02:18,"You put those all together so it's slightly thicker, white and black width and that is..."
00:02:18,00:02:19,It's kind of like more code.
00:02:19,00:02:22,Did you read about the guy who invented it and how he came up with it?
00:02:22,00:02:26,It was several people who developed it but one of the people in charge of developing the
00:02:26,00:02:30,idea was a guy called Norman Joseph Woodland and he was thinking about it when he was at the
00:02:30,00:02:36,beach and he drew a sort of Morse code pattern in the sand by doing dots and dashes poking
00:02:36,00:02:41,them in the sand and then pulled down those dots and dashes into bars and came up with
00:02:41,00:02:42,the barcode.
00:02:42,00:02:46,But then the developers turned it into the shape of a bullseye so the first barcodes were
00:02:46,00:02:47,actually bullseyes.
00:02:47,00:02:51,"Oh yeah, I don't know they took up loads of space, didn't it? So it's actually much more efficient"
00:02:51,00:02:54,to just go with the long line.
00:02:54,00:02:58,"You know that guy Joe Woodland who you just mentioned, so one of the pioneers, supposedly"
00:02:58,00:03:03,he came up with the idea indirectly because of the Atlantic City Mafia.
00:03:03,00:03:04,Go on.
00:03:04,00:03:09,"Okay, so he got the idea when he was at Drexel University in Philadelphia and he was doing"
00:03:09,00:03:14,"a master's degree there and he hadn't originally wanted to do a master's, he wanted to start"
00:03:14,00:03:19,"a business where he made a music system for lifts, but anyone to set up this whole phone"
00:03:19,00:03:26,"and his father said no, the mob controlled the music it lifts you in Atlantic City or on"
00:03:26,00:03:30,"the east coast of the USA, you're not allowed to go into that because they'll get you."
00:03:30,00:03:32,So instead he went off and did a master's and came up with a barcode instead.
00:03:32,00:03:36,"Oh, a weird industry to decide to control if you're a mafia."
00:03:36,00:03:37,I think they have a whole range.
00:03:37,00:03:40,It wasn't just lift music that they controlled.
00:03:40,00:03:45,"That feels like it was really like the mobster's baby brother, they needed to give him something."
00:03:45,00:03:51,Have you seen that in Venezuela's supermarkets since last year you've had to scan in your
00:03:51,00:03:57,thinker prints to get to buy anything because so you know Venezuela is going through a very
00:03:57,00:04:00,horrible time at the moment and there's a lot of food shortages and so the governments
00:04:00,00:04:03,had to ration stuff and people have been panic buying things like they'll just buy in
00:04:03,00:04:06,loads of grain or loads of cigarettes or whatever it is that I think the country is going
00:04:06,00:04:11,"to run out of and so in order to stop them doing that, supermarkets have installed fingerprint"
00:04:11,00:04:15,"scanners and when you buy something you have to provide ID, you have to give your name, your"
00:04:15,00:04:19,"address, your date of birth and you have to scan in your fingerprints so they can make"
00:04:19,00:04:20,sure that you haven't been over buying.
00:04:20,00:04:21,Whoa.
00:04:21,00:04:23,If you just want a loaf of bread.
00:04:23,00:04:29,I was looking into other animals with codes on so in 2010 farmers in some of the painted
00:04:29,00:04:34,QR codes onto their cows so that to try and raise awareness of their website this is
00:04:34,00:04:37,"dairyfarming.com, well, it's worked."
00:04:37,00:04:38,"My God, best website ever."
00:04:38,00:04:40,I spent all afternoon on it.
00:04:40,00:04:41,It's really good.
00:04:41,00:04:46,"There's videos of a new dairy farm technology, there's a farmer's dairy diary, I quite like"
00:04:46,00:04:47,dairy reader.
00:04:47,00:04:48,"Yeah, I did."
00:04:48,00:04:51,"There's a cow of the month as well, a little profile in the cow of the month."
00:04:51,00:04:54,And there's like what it's like to live as a cow and you can follow the journey of milk.
00:04:54,00:04:55,"It's a really good site, genuine."
00:04:55,00:04:56,He'd recommend it.
00:04:56,00:04:58,So the cows are rising the diary?
00:04:58,00:04:59,No.
00:04:59,00:05:00,The cows went to the videos.
00:05:00,00:05:04,"They put, they put cameras on the cows and then the cows go around and make videos."
00:05:04,00:05:05,What did they make videos?
00:05:05,00:05:06,What the cow...
00:05:06,00:05:09,"They didn't like edit the drives, so I thought they just gave a cow video camera."
00:05:09,00:05:10,They did that research.
00:05:10,00:05:13,"Did you see, there's a small island."
00:05:13,00:05:18,"I can't remember where it is, but they Google Street View has not got to them yet and they're"
00:05:18,00:05:22,quite furious because they've learned that Google Street View is a fantastic way about
00:05:22,00:05:25,"getting tourism because a lot of people just go, ""Wow, this place looks amazing."
00:05:25,00:05:26,"We should go."""
00:05:26,00:05:31,"So they've attached cameras, their own cameras, to the heads of sheep and goats and they just"
00:05:31,00:05:33,have them walk through and they've been taking photos.
00:05:33,00:05:36,So there's whole islands being mapped by sheep now.
00:05:36,00:05:40,"But all sheep do is eat grass, so presumably all you're seeing is this place is full of"
00:05:40,00:05:41,grass.
00:05:41,00:05:42,That's true.
00:05:42,00:05:43,We're close-ups of grass.
00:05:43,00:05:44,And also sheep farmers.
00:05:44,00:05:48,"So you're just going to get a lot of the same pictures, just a lot of sheep's bottoms and"
00:05:48,00:05:49,grass.
00:05:49,00:05:50,And tourism has plummeted.
00:05:50,00:05:53,"They're also naturally low down, as well, on the..."
00:05:53,00:05:54,Yeah.
00:05:54,00:05:55,It's not practical.
00:05:55,00:05:56,They're...
00:05:56,00:05:57,Yeah.
00:05:57,00:06:01,"Also on barcodes, embryos are going to get them."
00:06:01,00:06:04,"They're developing these at the moment and this is to stop baby swap disasters, because"
00:06:04,00:06:07,"you know, there are always a few news stories every year where people end up with the wrong"
00:06:07,00:06:08,baby.
00:06:08,00:06:11,But the barcode doesn't go on the embryo.
00:06:11,00:06:12,It goes on the egg.
00:06:12,00:06:13,One goes...
00:06:13,00:06:14,It goes on the egg or on the sperm.
00:06:14,00:06:15,On the actual...
00:06:15,00:06:16,Wow.
00:06:16,00:06:17,"Yeah, on the sperm."
00:06:17,00:06:18,And it's a barcode of sperm.
00:06:18,00:06:19,"Well, they're on it."
00:06:19,00:06:20,"It's gonna be a nightmare to scan, apart from anything else."
00:06:20,00:06:21,It kinda goes off 500 minutes.
00:06:21,00:06:22,Yeah.
00:06:22,00:06:26,Not anyone at one.
00:06:26,00:06:27,Here's a thing about barcodes.
00:06:27,00:06:36,"When they were introduced in the '70s, I think the first item bought with the UPC, which"
00:06:36,00:06:40,"stands for Universal Product Code System, was a bit of chewing gum."
00:06:40,00:06:44,"But it was really hard to introduce, because obviously you need hundreds of products to"
00:06:44,00:06:47,have barcodes in order for it to be worth anyone's while.
00:06:47,00:06:51,"And also, they didn't use to come on the packaging, so used to get the food into the shop"
00:06:51,00:06:54,and then you would have to stick on the barcodes.
00:06:54,00:06:55,Ah!
00:06:55,00:06:57,The shopkeepers had to glue them onto the boxes.
00:06:57,00:06:58,Then you could scan them.
00:06:58,00:06:59,"I mean, that doesn't..."
00:06:59,00:07:04,"That's not really that weird, because a lot of reduced foods in supermarkets come with"
00:07:04,00:07:05,a fresh barcode.
00:07:05,00:07:06,That's a good point.
00:07:06,00:07:07,That's a good point.
00:07:07,00:07:08,"So, yeah."
00:07:08,00:07:09,But people were frightened of them initially in the '70s.
00:07:09,00:07:12,"People thought that they'd be blinded, because their lasers evolved."
00:07:12,00:07:13,"Oh, yeah."
00:07:13,00:07:14,Blinded by the scanners.
00:07:14,00:07:15,By the scanners.
00:07:15,00:07:16,"Yeah, but you just get them a barcode."
00:07:16,00:07:17,That's a bit.
00:07:17,00:07:19,"Yeah, but it is quite alien, isn't it?"
00:07:19,00:07:23,"If you're used to someone just ringing up goods at the till, or, you know, a label which"
00:07:23,00:07:24,"says 50p, this weird..."
00:07:24,00:07:25,I don't know.
00:07:25,00:07:26,I don't know.
00:07:26,00:07:27,I'm not frightened of them.
00:07:27,00:07:28,I'd like to make that very clear.
00:07:28,00:07:29,It was the '70s.
00:07:29,00:07:30,We had...
00:07:30,00:07:31,We'd landed on the moon.
00:07:31,00:07:32,I don't know.
00:07:32,00:07:33,Petrified.
00:07:33,00:07:36,I don't think witchcraft people running out of supermarkets screaming.
00:07:36,00:07:39,We landed on the moon before we had the barcode.
00:07:39,00:07:40,Yeah.
00:07:40,00:07:41,That's weird.
00:07:41,00:07:42,That is odd.
00:07:42,00:07:43,Yeah.
00:07:43,00:07:44,Yeah.
00:07:44,00:07:46,It feels like the moon is the landing is the last thing that we should do.
00:07:46,00:07:48,I'm not sure we should have landed there.
00:07:48,00:07:49,Yeah.
00:07:49,00:07:50,Even.
00:07:50,00:07:56,Funny that you mentioned the devil because the universe of product code is part of a big
00:07:56,00:07:57,devil conspiracy.
00:07:57,00:07:58,"Oh, yeah."
00:07:58,00:07:59,Yeah.
00:07:59,00:08:00,Yeah.
00:08:00,00:08:04,"It begins and ends with some sort of easy identifying lines, so that the lasers kind of"
00:08:04,00:08:06,know where the code begins and ends.
00:08:06,00:08:08,And that resembles a 666 on either side.
00:08:08,00:08:09,"No, there is."
00:08:09,00:08:10,There's a six.
00:08:10,00:08:11,And a six.
00:08:11,00:08:12,There are three sixes throughout the barcode.
00:08:12,00:08:13,They're not quite sixes.
00:08:13,00:08:14,They...
00:08:14,00:08:16,"There are sixes as well in the barcode, obviously."
00:08:16,00:08:20,"But at the beginning, they're just markers that look like sixes, they're not quite sixes."
00:08:20,00:08:25,"And there's the guy who developed the product code, George Joseph Lara, has got a section"
00:08:25,00:08:28,on his website where he addresses this constant accusation.
00:08:28,00:08:30,"He says, ""There's nothing sinister about this."
00:08:30,00:08:32,"They resemble sixes."""
00:08:32,00:08:36,"It's simply a coincidence, like the fact that my first middle and last name will have six"
00:08:36,00:08:37,lasers.
00:08:37,00:08:42,"If you'd like to ask me anything more about this, sacrifice a lamb on your lawn at midnight."
00:08:42,00:08:47,"He does say, ""I will not be answering any questions of this as of October 2000,"" or something."
00:08:47,00:08:49,There's a section on his website.
00:08:49,00:08:51,"Like the video that you remember, ""Ringo Star?"""
00:08:51,00:08:52,"Oh, yes."
00:08:52,00:08:53,Peace and love.
00:08:53,00:08:54,Peace and love.
00:08:54,00:08:55,I'm not answering any more fan mail as of this date.
00:08:55,00:08:56,"Peace and love, peace and love."
00:08:56,00:09:00,"The thing is, I genuinely believe that Ringo Star gets quite a lot of fan mail, whereas"
00:09:00,00:09:06,I really struggle to believe that this man is just in on dates.
00:09:06,00:09:10,"Or if he is, it's the same two mad people and he can just block their addresses."
00:09:10,00:09:16,I was trying to look into how zookeepers identify different species of animals.
00:09:16,00:09:19,Say they have a bunch in the cage and what do they do to do that.
00:09:19,00:09:22,"Sometimes they have training to teach them the difference between, say, a rabbit and"
00:09:22,00:09:23,a giraffe.
00:09:23,00:09:24,Exactly.
00:09:24,00:09:25,It's true.
00:09:25,00:09:29,It's a better resource to do this though.
00:09:29,00:09:30,And I didn't find anything.
00:09:30,00:09:34,But this is the only reason I wanted to mention is that there's a great hashtag that you
00:09:34,00:09:39,"can find on Twitter, which is #ZooKeepersProblems, and it's just really fun because zookeepers"
00:09:39,00:09:41,around the world just put up their problems.
00:09:41,00:09:43,So a few I have here.
00:09:43,00:09:49,"From yummy tees, I have way too much lemur pee in my hair right now."
00:09:49,00:09:55,"From Jillian Erzare, @JillianErzare, punched in the vaj by a tortoise, #ZooKeeperProblems."
00:09:55,00:10:02,How slow is Jillian?
00:10:02,00:10:06,"Zebra's caused the most injuries to zookeepers, more than any other animal."
00:10:06,00:10:10,Are those injuries caused when the zookeepers mispronounced their name so egregiously just
00:10:10,00:10:11,like Andy did earlier?
00:10:11,00:10:12,Yeah.
00:10:12,00:10:13,Because I think that's terrible.
00:10:13,00:10:14,What did I say?
00:10:14,00:10:15,Hey Zebra.
00:10:15,00:10:19,That's going to be the only kind of feedback we'll get about this episode is people saying
00:10:19,00:10:22,why on earth does Andy say Zebra?
00:10:22,00:10:23,Is it a problem?
00:10:23,00:10:24,It's going to be.
00:10:24,00:10:25,Believe you me.
00:10:25,00:10:26,"Potato, potato."
00:10:26,00:10:27,"Zebra, zebra."
00:10:27,00:10:28,Yeah.
00:10:28,00:10:29,Zebra.
00:10:29,00:10:30,No.
00:10:30,00:10:31,No.
00:10:31,00:10:32,Doesn't sound right.
00:10:32,00:10:33,So why are they injuring us?
00:10:33,00:10:35,"Because they're wild animals, but people think they're like horses."
00:10:35,00:10:37,So I think that it's just you're more likely to be injured.
00:10:37,00:10:38,So we're not domesticated.
00:10:38,00:10:39,No.
00:10:39,00:10:41,It's impossible to domesticate a zebra.
00:10:41,00:10:48,"They're really, in fact there's only one person I found who managed to even slightly domesticate"
00:10:48,00:10:49,them.
00:10:49,00:10:50,And that was Walter Rothschild.
00:10:50,00:10:51,Have you heard of him?
00:10:51,00:10:52,Yes.
00:10:52,00:10:53,He is an amazing man.
00:10:53,00:10:59,"He was a late 19th century, early 20th century, he was a zoologist, naturalist."
00:10:59,00:11:01,He had the most amazing collections of animals.
00:11:01,00:11:04,He collected tens of thousands of butterflies.
00:11:04,00:11:08,"He was a Rothschild from the banking dynasty, the Rothschilds, so he was seriously wealthy."
00:11:08,00:11:12,"He didn't care about any of the banking stuff, all he wanted was to collect animals."
00:11:12,00:11:18,"And he had a carriage, a harnessed with four zebras, and he rode it along Piccadilly and"
00:11:18,00:11:20,into the forecourt of Buckingham Palace.
00:11:20,00:11:22,"Oh, I think I've seen a photo of that."
00:11:22,00:11:23,"Yeah, yeah."
00:11:23,00:11:24,"Yeah, yeah."
00:11:24,00:11:27,It's really for one of these sort of historical photos that gets trotted out a lot.
00:11:27,00:11:28,Yeah.
00:11:28,00:11:29,Nobody?
00:11:29,00:11:31,I'm surprised that we still have it.
00:11:31,00:11:35,It seems to be one of those evolution questions that we haven't solved yet of why they have
00:11:35,00:11:36,the black and white.
00:11:36,00:11:40,"That my favourite theory, I just can't believe this, is that it cools the zebra down because"
00:11:40,00:11:48,"air might move more quickly over the black bits of skin, which absorb light, and then more"
00:11:48,00:11:53,"slowly over the white stripes, which reflect it, which might make little convection currents"
00:11:53,00:11:54,around the zebra to cool down.
00:11:54,00:11:55,Wow.
00:11:55,00:11:57,I cannot believe that is true.
00:11:57,00:12:01,"Well, I mean, first of all, I think that God/Darwin is looking down on the zebra debate and"
00:12:01,00:12:05,"going, ""You guys are overthinking this."""
00:12:05,00:12:06,So I just thought it would be fun.
00:12:06,00:12:10,I love the theory that God/Darwin is looking down right now.
00:12:10,00:12:13,"Only one of them will be looking down right now, if they're right."
00:12:13,00:12:14,"No, they're right."
00:12:14,00:12:15,They're right.
00:12:15,00:12:18,"In fact, it's either both of them are looking down right now."
00:12:18,00:12:19,Sorry.
00:12:19,00:12:30,"Okay, it's time for fact number two, and that is Alex."
00:12:30,00:12:34,My fact this week is that Agatha Christie was once turned away from a party held in her
00:12:34,00:12:35,honour.
00:12:35,00:12:36,Nice.
00:12:36,00:12:37,I think we've all had that.
00:12:37,00:12:38,Yeah.
00:12:38,00:12:40,Was she too drunk?
00:12:40,00:12:43,"No, she was too shy, actually, that was the problem."
00:12:43,00:12:49,"So this is in April in 1958, the Maustrap, which is the play in London that is based"
00:12:49,00:12:54,"on the book that she wrote, became the longest-running production in history of British theatre, so most"
00:12:54,00:12:57,"performances ever, 2,200, 39 performances."
00:12:57,00:13:03,"And there was a big party in the Savoya tell, and so she turned up, all dressed up and went"
00:13:03,00:13:07,"to the party room, and the guy at the door didn't recognise her, and she was so shy that"
00:13:07,00:13:10,she just got reinbarassed and went and sat in the lounge and had a drink by herself
00:13:10,00:13:13,from most of the evening.
00:13:13,00:13:16,"She'd been asked to turn up early, haven't she, by Peter Saunders, who was the producer"
00:13:16,00:13:21,"of Maustrap, who said, 'Avoid the press by turning up early, and you can sneak in early'."
00:13:21,00:13:25,"And I think when she did that, she couldn't get into the party, actually, stars it."
00:13:25,00:13:26,"Oh, so she did make it into the party?"
00:13:26,00:13:27,"She did get into the party, yeah."
00:13:27,00:13:31,"Because I read an account in the British newspaper archive from the stage newspaper in 1958,"
00:13:31,00:13:35,"and it was an account of the speech that she made, and Richard Attenborough actually"
00:13:35,00:13:38,"gave this interview about what she'd said, and she just stood up, it was one of the shortest"
00:13:38,00:13:40,speeches in theatre histories.
00:13:40,00:13:44,"She said, 'Well, darlings, I think we'll get a few months out of it.'"
00:13:44,00:13:49,"So, yeah, which is weird, because at that point she'd already got ten years out of it."
00:13:49,00:13:53,"In 1972, to exacerbate her shyness, there was another party held in her honour, because"
00:13:53,00:13:56,there seemed to be a constant party's held in honour of someone who was very shy.
00:13:56,00:13:57,It's like a form of torture.
00:13:57,00:14:02,"But in 1972, she turned up to the party, and she forgot her false teeth, because she was"
00:14:02,00:14:05,"in her 80s at that point, and so none of the guests were allowed to speak to her, except"
00:14:05,00:14:08,"her very closest friends, because she didn't want to open her mouth."
00:14:08,00:14:11,And did that cure her shyness?
00:14:11,00:14:14,"Does it cure her shyness, if nobody speaks to you?"
00:14:14,00:14:17,"I suppose it might do, because then you have to go and speak to other people."
00:14:17,00:14:19,Can you imagine you're a shy type?
00:14:19,00:14:22,You've plucked up the courage to go to your party.
00:14:22,00:14:26,"You know everyone's going to want to talk to you, and you haven't brought your fucking teeth."
00:14:26,00:14:29,"Oh, man."
00:14:29,00:14:30,"Yeah, it's a tough moment."
00:14:30,00:14:33,It's a tough moment.
00:14:33,00:14:38,"So, I was reading the SmouseTrap play when she died the right when over to her grandson,"
00:14:38,00:14:43,"Matthew Prichard, and there's been this big thing where he's been in a bit of a fight"
00:14:43,00:14:50,"with Wikipedia, because Wikipedia, often whenever they put the novel or anything, they'll often"
00:14:50,00:14:53,do a really detailed plot analysis of what goes on.
00:14:53,00:14:58,"And SmouseTrap famously has a plot twist right at the end, and it's up there."
00:14:58,00:15:01,"And so he's been trying to get them to take it down, and it's very funny, because even"
00:15:01,00:15:04,"on the Wikipedia, they now acknowledge that he's trying to do it."
00:15:04,00:15:06,But so that he hasn't won.
00:15:06,00:15:08,Wikipedia says this is just information.
00:15:08,00:15:09,It stays up there.
00:15:09,00:15:11,"But it's interesting this plot twist, because it's, it's the plot twist."
00:15:11,00:15:12,"Hang on, wait."
00:15:12,00:15:17,"I'm not going to say it, but the plot twist has become famous for being a plot twist."
00:15:17,00:15:22,"And so I for one know what the plot twist is, because of people saying, oh, there's this"
00:15:22,00:15:26,"famous plot twist where this happens, I've never actually experienced the actual twist."
00:15:26,00:15:30,And I reckon the majority of people know what the twist is without ever having actually
00:15:30,00:15:32,"had the twist happen to them, which is a shame."
00:15:32,00:15:36,"I don't know what the twist is, so I'm not going to go on the Wikipedia page."
00:15:36,00:15:39,I kind of feel like it would be sporting of them to take it down.
00:15:39,00:15:45,"Well, there is, surprisingly, or rather unsurprisingly, on Wikipedia, there's a page you can go to"
00:15:45,00:15:50,with huge discussions from all the Wikipedia and about the attitude they're taking towards
00:15:50,00:15:51,spoilers.
00:15:51,00:15:52,That sounds like a really fun reading.
00:15:52,00:15:57,"It's surprised on the Saturday afternoon, but yeah, I mean, it depends on the role of an"
00:15:57,00:15:58,"encyclopedia, doesn't it?"
00:15:58,00:16:01,"Is the role of an encyclopedia to tell you everything about, you know, the ending of"
00:16:01,00:16:02,all plots?
00:16:02,00:16:06,Or is the role of an encyclopedia to peak your interest so you want to know more?
00:16:06,00:16:09,"No, I think it's the first one."
00:16:09,00:16:14,"To find out what Zebra's really, you'll have to come and see the stage show."
00:16:14,00:16:17,Do you know how she described herself?
00:16:17,00:16:20,She said she was a sausage machine.
00:16:20,00:16:21,Why?
00:16:21,00:16:26,A lot of sausage party vital difference.
00:16:26,00:16:30,"No, this was at a time of her life when she was writing two books a year."
00:16:30,00:16:32,"She said, I'm a sausage machine, a perfect sausage machine."
00:16:32,00:16:38,"There was one year where I think she wrote seven books, plays, and the collections of short"
00:16:38,00:16:39,stories.
00:16:39,00:16:43,"If anything, she's a mystery novel machine rather than a sausage machine."
00:16:43,00:16:47,I think it was a metaphor rather than actually describing it as a story.
00:16:47,00:16:51,"And that was all made up so brilliant as an author is she never, you know, she sometimes"
00:16:51,00:16:52,would not literally describe the thing.
00:16:52,00:16:55,"She was like, I know, but I know it was all those sausages in the leaves, I don't think"
00:16:55,00:16:56,I have all the time.
00:16:56,00:16:57,Is that the plot twists in the mouth?
00:16:57,00:17:00,"Yeah, the lead character is a sausage all along."
00:17:00,00:17:03,It was in the drawing room with a sausage.
00:17:03,00:17:08,"I like the idea of her at the press conference where she's giving the interview saying, the"
00:17:08,00:17:12,"thing about me is I'm just a sausage machine, a perfect sausage machine and every single"
00:17:12,00:17:17,"journalist trying to suppress that snigger, so they write it down."
00:17:17,00:17:18,Is this the case?
00:17:18,00:17:22,"It's actually saying it without any teeth in as well, that's the reason."
00:17:22,00:17:24,Do you know where she did a load of her writing?
00:17:24,00:17:25,On paper.
00:17:25,00:17:32,"On paper and in a rock, I don't know this, second husband was an archaeologist and a really"
00:17:32,00:17:37,evident archaeologist and she went out and did a load of digs with him.
00:17:37,00:17:41,"So there are loads of stories happen in, you know, exotic archaeology dig sites and that"
00:17:41,00:17:42,kind of thing.
00:17:42,00:17:47,"Or the affair few at least which do and that's why she was a very keen archaeologist, wasn't"
00:17:47,00:17:48,she?
00:17:48,00:17:51,"In the second part, like she herself got into it as well as her husband."
00:17:51,00:17:55,"She said to her husband there's this sort of famous anecdote where she says, I just"
00:17:55,00:18:00,"wish I knew a bit more about this kind of pottery stuff and he says, do you realize you know more"
00:18:00,00:18:05,"about this ancient pottery than any other woman alive in the world today, because it wasn't"
00:18:05,00:18:06,really studied by women at the time.
00:18:06,00:18:07,Right.
00:18:07,00:18:08,"You know, it was quite a closed shop."
00:18:08,00:18:09,Yeah.
00:18:09,00:18:10,Yeah.
00:18:10,00:18:11,Wow.
00:18:11,00:18:13,"If you go to the British Museum, you can see a bunch of artifacts that he uncovered."
00:18:13,00:18:18,"I think he made a particularly important find in Nimrod, which is an ancient and rocky city."
00:18:18,00:18:22,"I found some, a bunch of sort of 3000 year old artifacts and they're in the British"
00:18:22,00:18:25,"museum and because she cleaned all his artifacts, you can go and see stuff that's been"
00:18:25,00:18:26,cleaned by Agatha Christie.
00:18:26,00:18:27,That is so cool.
00:18:27,00:18:28,It's not cool.
00:18:28,00:18:31,So the British Museum says the reason these have probably been preserved so well over the last
00:18:31,00:18:34,hundred years is because they were perfectly cleaned by Christie.
00:18:34,00:18:35,They call it the Queen of Clean.
00:18:35,00:18:37,They call it the sausage machine.
00:18:37,00:18:39,They call it the sausage machine.
00:18:39,00:18:40,They call it the sausage machine.
00:18:40,00:18:41,They call it the sausage machine.
00:18:41,00:18:42,They call it the sausage machine.
00:18:42,00:18:51,I was looking into other people who've been turned away or kicked out from their parties.
00:18:51,00:18:53,Nirvana kicked out of their own Nevermind Release Party.
00:18:53,00:18:54,Wow.
00:18:54,00:18:58,And what they say is they walked away.
00:18:58,00:19:03,It's really odd though because you read what they did when they got there.
00:19:03,00:19:08,Basically they started tossing around a watermelon and they effectively started a food fight
00:19:08,00:19:11,and they were told to leave the release of their album.
00:19:11,00:19:14,That's a pretty hardcore food fight to start throwing an entire watermelon.
00:19:14,00:19:15,That's true.
00:19:15,00:19:16,Yeah.
00:19:16,00:19:20,I can understand if it's loved at someone's face that that might be.
00:19:20,00:19:21,Start with mashed potatoes.
00:19:21,00:19:22,Something.
00:19:22,00:19:24,I've got a fact about parties.
00:19:24,00:19:27,There are schools in Japan for how to have a party.
00:19:27,00:19:28,I don't know.
00:19:28,00:19:29,Yeah.
00:19:29,00:19:30,Cool.
00:19:30,00:19:32,Because it's not really the dumb thing because most people live in very small homes.
00:19:32,00:19:36,So you don't really have parties where you have loads of people around very much.
00:19:36,00:19:40,"So there is this group which has been set up called the Home Party Association, which teaches"
00:19:40,00:19:41,you how.
00:19:41,00:19:44,And there are three levels of certification.
00:19:44,00:19:45,First one.
00:19:45,00:19:49,You just have to send them about 22 quid and pictures of a party that you have thrown.
00:19:49,00:19:50,Second one.
00:19:50,00:19:51,Level two.
00:19:51,00:19:54,You have to attend five hours of lectures in how to throw a party and you have to write
00:19:54,00:19:55,an essay.
00:19:55,00:19:57,And that costs about 200 quid.
00:19:57,00:20:01,The third one costs about 450 quid for all the training.
00:20:01,00:20:05,And you have to successfully host a party attended by the examiners of the school.
00:20:05,00:20:06,Oh my god.
00:20:06,00:20:07,And get this.
00:20:07,00:20:08,Get this.
00:20:08,00:20:09,The failure rate is 90%.
00:20:09,00:20:10,Whoa.
00:20:10,00:20:11,No shit.
00:20:11,00:20:14,Any party attended by examiners is going to be great.
00:20:14,00:20:15,Yeah.
00:20:15,00:20:18,"By definition, inviting your teachers to a party ruins it."
00:20:18,00:20:19,Oh my god.
00:20:19,00:20:24,What you should have taken tips from is the party of the century in the 20th century.
00:20:24,00:20:28,"And I'd never heard of this, but it's this party that apparently is the party of the"
00:20:28,00:20:29,century.
00:20:29,00:20:30,It was in 1951.
00:20:30,00:20:35,"It was thrown by someone who was known as Charlie, who was heir to some great Mexican silver"
00:20:35,00:20:36,fortune.
00:20:36,00:20:38,And it sounds incredible.
00:20:38,00:20:43,"And it's been remembered in great party history, great party law, as the greatest party"
00:20:43,00:20:44,ever thrown.
00:20:44,00:20:48,And so you said a bunch of stuff there that doesn't exist.
00:20:48,00:20:49,Great party law.
00:20:49,00:20:50,The great party law.
00:20:50,00:20:51,The great party law.
00:20:51,00:20:55,The people of famous parties mentioned at every party.
00:20:55,00:20:59,"It's great and secretly, it's like the beat of party legends."
00:20:59,00:21:02,"I never, I never throw a party without reminding on my guests of the greatest party of the"
00:21:02,00:21:04,century in 1951.
00:21:04,00:21:07,"If you guys had attended these Japanese lectures, you'd be highly familiar."
00:21:07,00:21:09,What happened at this great party?
00:21:09,00:21:10,So this is what happened.
00:21:10,00:21:14,It took place in the Palazzo Lebia in Venice.
00:21:14,00:21:15,Oh no.
00:21:15,00:21:17,"Okay, it sounded good."
00:21:17,00:21:18,You weren't wrong.
00:21:18,00:21:24,"It was called the Bal Orientali, or the Bal Oriental, depending on which pronunciation is"
00:21:24,00:21:25,correct.
00:21:25,00:21:27,"So sorry, an Oriental ball inside a labia?"
00:21:27,00:21:28,"Yeah, that's correct."
00:21:28,00:21:29,Okay.
00:21:29,00:21:34,"The host wore 16-inch platform shoes, so he was six foot ten, so he towered above all of"
00:21:34,00:21:35,his guests.
00:21:35,00:21:38,He changed his costume 16 times throughout the evening.
00:21:38,00:21:42,And the roof of the place had a garden designed by Dali.
00:21:42,00:21:44,And Dali actually did attend.
00:21:44,00:21:48,They attended and Christian Dior attended and they came dressed up as each other.
00:21:48,00:21:51,That should have a fun little trick.
00:21:51,00:21:55,"It was a costume ball, but Orson Wells' costume didn't arrive on time, so he had to wear"
00:21:55,00:21:58,"just a normal suit, which is very embarrassing for Orson."
00:21:58,00:21:59,We came to himself.
00:21:59,00:22:01,That's quite a good costume for a party.
00:22:01,00:22:02,Yeah.
00:22:02,00:22:07,He should have just claimed he wasn't Orson Wells.
00:22:07,00:22:12,"Daisy Fellows was there, who was a very famous, I think, journalist or socialite at the"
00:22:12,00:22:13,time.
00:22:13,00:22:16,"It was the first time anyone had ever worn leopard print, so she started the trend for wearing"
00:22:16,00:22:17,leopard print in the West.
00:22:17,00:22:21,"It was the first time, you know, a western person had worn leopard print."
00:22:21,00:22:23,This party is sounding better and better.
00:22:23,00:22:24,Isn't it?
00:22:24,00:22:27,So many people threatened to be clear-patterned that it had to be up to the host to settle
00:22:27,00:22:29,who was going to come as a clear-patterned.
00:22:29,00:22:30,Right.
00:22:30,00:22:31,To be clear-patterned.
00:22:31,00:22:36,"It's an anonymous phone call, it's someone who's going to be clear-patterned, your party."
00:22:36,00:22:40,"Americans who hadn't been invited, because it was so famous it was happening, they sailed"
00:22:40,00:22:45,"over and arrived in the Lido nearby in their yachts, just in the desperate hope of getting"
00:22:45,00:22:46,an invitation.
00:22:46,00:22:51,"So there were all these wealthy people's yachts, parks in nearby coastline and Lido's, just"
00:22:51,00:22:52,in the hope that they get it.
00:22:52,00:22:53,Doesn't it sound incredible?
00:22:53,00:22:54,"That's unbelievable, isn't it?"
00:22:54,00:22:56,But who's Charlie?
00:22:56,00:22:57,Just a super rich guy.
00:22:57,00:22:59,No one really knows anything more about him.
00:22:59,00:23:00,That's amazing.
00:23:00,00:23:01,It sounds kind of great.
00:23:01,00:23:02,Gatsby-esque.
00:23:02,00:23:03,So great Gatsby.
00:23:03,00:23:05,Do you know what was the period of?
00:23:05,00:23:06,Was that correct?
00:23:06,00:23:07,It's slightly late in the morning.
00:23:07,00:23:08,Gatsby is 20s.
00:23:08,00:23:09,Really?
00:23:09,00:23:14,"I'm Truman Capote through party as well, which was to tie in with the publication of In Cold"
00:23:14,00:23:15,Blood.
00:23:15,00:23:19,"And that, apparently, in America was the big party of 1966."
00:23:19,00:23:26,"Yeah, so it was dubbed the night Capote made 500 friends and 15,000 enemies, because the"
00:23:26,00:23:28,invitations were so coveted.
00:23:28,00:23:33,The idea that he was saying no to people to the come to this party created more enemies
00:23:33,00:23:37,"than the people who had been coming, liking him."
00:23:37,00:23:42,"And everyone wore masks, so it was, you know, no one who knew who anyone was there."
00:23:42,00:23:44,"Frank Sinatra was there, apparently, Lauren Bacol apparently."
00:23:44,00:23:45,No one knows.
00:23:45,00:23:46,They had a mask on.
00:23:46,00:23:49,"The only person without a mask was Andy Warhol, who just decided not to wear a mask."
00:23:49,00:23:50,So arty.
00:23:50,00:23:51,And yeah.
00:23:51,00:23:56,"That's like when Brian Cranston went to Comic-Con, and he wore a plastic mask with his own"
00:23:56,00:23:57,"face on it, no one recognized him."
00:23:57,00:23:58,That's really good.
00:23:58,00:23:59,"Yeah, it's funny."
00:23:59,00:24:04,"Are we sure Truman Capote didn't just invite a few thousand randomers off the street,"
00:24:04,00:24:07,"but mask on them, take photos and then point at the various photos going, that's Frank Sinatra"
00:24:07,00:24:08,there.
00:24:08,00:24:12,Skepticism from the woman who told us this cock and bull story about the greatest party
00:24:12,00:24:13,in 1951 ever told.
00:24:13,00:24:19,I don't like being faced with this Capote competition.
00:24:19,00:24:22,"Salvador Dali once said, ""I am never alone."
00:24:22,00:24:27,"I'm used to being with Salvador Dali always, and that, for me, is a permanent party."""
00:24:27,00:24:38,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Chuzinski."
00:24:38,00:24:44,My fact this week is that different species of dolphins babysit each other's children.
00:24:44,00:24:48,So this is some research that was done a while back and reported in the Marine Mammal Science
00:24:48,00:24:53,"Journal, and it's about bottlenose dolphins and spotted dolphins and how they work together"
00:24:53,00:24:55,and they do loads of stuff together.
00:24:55,00:24:58,And one of the things they do together is leave their children with each other.
00:24:58,00:25:03,"So when dolphins dive deep to hunt squid, for instance, their kids, young dolphins can't"
00:25:03,00:25:06,"dive that deep, so they leave them with someone to care for them."
00:25:06,00:25:11,"And these two species, the first instance of species, probably cooperating in this way."
00:25:11,00:25:15,It would be great if you could get an animal babysitter just for your kids.
00:25:15,00:25:16,What kind of animal would you pick to babysit your children?
00:25:16,00:25:17,Presumably not dolphin.
00:25:17,00:25:18,Not zebra either.
00:25:18,00:25:19,Yeah.
00:25:19,00:25:20,Well dolphins are very well qualified.
00:25:20,00:25:33,"If you give the kids armbands and drop them in the sea, then get spotted dolphin to live."
00:25:33,00:25:34,I don't know.
00:25:34,00:25:35,I don't know.
00:25:35,00:25:37,"Anytime I've heard about people with dolphins, you always are sort of weird humping going"
00:25:37,00:25:38,on here.
00:25:38,00:25:39,So I feel like you want to tell the sexy dolphins.
00:25:39,00:25:40,"No, no, no, no."
00:25:40,00:25:42,"I just, I just, anytime I've read about dolphins."
00:25:42,00:25:43,Yeah.
00:25:43,00:25:44,Okay.
00:25:44,00:25:47,But then maybe I shouldn't be googling those particular keywords.
00:25:47,00:25:48,Yeah.
00:25:48,00:25:50,So the wrong section of the library.
00:25:50,00:25:58,"Do you know that dolphin nipples are secret in the, even though they don't know about the"
00:25:58,00:25:59,secret?
00:25:59,00:26:00,They're hidden.
00:26:00,00:26:06,They have these abdominal slits and the nipples are kind of inside the slits or the mammary
00:26:06,00:26:07,slits they're called.
00:26:07,00:26:10,And also the penis of the male dolphin is the same.
00:26:10,00:26:15,"It's in a slit and it sort of, it can poke out, but it can retract within the slit as"
00:26:15,00:26:16,well.
00:26:16,00:26:17,So it's not.
00:26:17,00:26:18,How convenient.
00:26:18,00:26:22,The article title that was called dolphins have scary hand-like penises and did you read
00:26:22,00:26:23,that as well?
00:26:23,00:26:25,"Well, I did, but I've read a debunking of it."
00:26:25,00:26:29,"But you say, what, what have you, no, I just, they have a retractable penis."
00:26:29,00:26:35,"And the idea was that they use it to find things if they're near, if they're near a sort"
00:26:35,00:26:39,"of a surface area, they'll use it like humans in the dark, use hands to find their way"
00:26:39,00:26:40,around.
00:26:40,00:26:41,So it's not.
00:26:41,00:26:43,I'm afraid that's not quite true.
00:26:43,00:26:48,"I've read a thing by a science writer called Justin Gregg, who's a bit of an expert on these"
00:26:48,00:26:49,masses.
00:26:49,00:26:53,"And he's, there's a myth that dolphins have prehensile penises and that doesn't really make"
00:26:53,00:26:57,"any sense because prehensile, like prehensile tails, which can be used to grip and grab things"
00:26:57,00:27:00,and wrap around things.
00:27:00,00:27:03,They can extend it and they can retract it and they can bend it in different directions
00:27:03,00:27:06,to help with mating.
00:27:06,00:27:09,"But they probably can't pick up keys, for example."
00:27:09,00:27:10,Yeah.
00:27:10,00:27:12,But that's enough to give some directions with that kind of...
00:27:12,00:27:13,Yeah.
00:27:13,00:27:14,"If you had really tried hard, yeah."
00:27:14,00:27:15,"Oh, so that's not too far off."
00:27:15,00:27:16,It's not too far off.
00:27:16,00:27:17,Yeah.
00:27:17,00:27:18,Yeah.
00:27:18,00:27:19,So this is an interesting thing.
00:27:19,00:27:24,"They have such control because dolphins, like whales, they have pelvis, because they evolved"
00:27:24,00:27:28,"from land animals, which got bored of being on land, went back into the sea, right?"
00:27:28,00:27:32,So all the muscles which attach to their penis and give them this control that left right
00:27:32,00:27:37,"in out, that kind of thing, they are directly attached to the pelvic bone."
00:27:37,00:27:42,And one side to say it's like operating a trick kite where you pull two strings and pulling
00:27:42,00:27:44,left and right makes it go in a loop-de-loop.
00:27:44,00:27:45,But I don't think...
00:27:45,00:27:46,Wow.
00:27:46,00:27:47,That's quite a specialized...
00:27:47,00:27:48,I don't think dolphins and penises can do a loop-de-loop.
00:27:48,00:27:50,You were talking about the secret nipples.
00:27:50,00:27:54,It's really interesting how the babies drink the mother's milk.
00:27:54,00:27:57,So they have a tongue that they can turn into like a little straw.
00:27:57,00:27:59,"You know when you kind of like loop your tongue over and some people do that, yeah."
00:27:59,00:28:00,"No, yeah."
00:28:00,00:28:01,Like that.
00:28:01,00:28:02,They do that.
00:28:02,00:28:05,And their tongue has little fingery things on the end that kind of go into the nipple
00:28:05,00:28:08,"and act a bit like a zip, like they kind of latch on to make it a little bit of a seal."
00:28:08,00:28:11,"Because it is difficult, because they're drinking milk under water, so it's liquid and"
00:28:11,00:28:12,liquid.
00:28:12,00:28:14,"Oh yeah, otherwise it would see pounds."
00:28:14,00:28:15,"Yeah, exactly."
00:28:15,00:28:17,"And it's got the consists of milkshake, apparently, the milk."
00:28:17,00:28:19,"And yeah, it lost about five to ten seconds."
00:28:19,00:28:20,But it smells...
00:28:20,00:28:21,It smells a fish.
00:28:21,00:28:23,Probably a milkshake that smells a fish.
00:28:23,00:28:25,I imagine everything smells a fish in the ocean.
00:28:25,00:28:27,But can't they only taste salt?
00:28:27,00:28:28,"Ooh, yeah."
00:28:28,00:28:29,I think it's right.
00:28:29,00:28:30,"Yeah, I think that is true."
00:28:30,00:28:32,They lost all their other taste buds.
00:28:32,00:28:33,They lost the sense of smell.
00:28:33,00:28:38,"They used to have it when they were on land and then obviously in water, you don't need"
00:28:38,00:28:40,to smell the air.
00:28:40,00:28:43,And then the nostrils moved above their head to become the blowhole.
00:28:43,00:28:44,I just...
00:28:44,00:28:47,"I want to know about the middle of that process, when the nostrils were moving north."
00:28:47,00:28:48,Yeah.
00:28:48,00:28:51,If you want to have a lesson stage where they had the nostrils in there for you.
00:28:51,00:28:52,Yeah.
00:28:52,00:28:53,The unicorn look.
00:28:53,00:28:54,Yeah.
00:28:54,00:28:55,"It's bizarre, isn't it?"
00:28:55,00:28:56,It's so bizarre.
00:28:56,00:28:58,"You know, dolphins' grandmother sometimes feed them."
00:28:58,00:29:00,"So, and they employ wet nurses, I think?"
00:29:00,00:29:01,It's underwater.
00:29:01,00:29:02,They're all wet nurses.
00:29:02,00:29:04,[laughter]
00:29:04,00:29:12,There's a theory that the male dolphins can tell when female dolphins are pregnant because
00:29:12,00:29:13,they take...
00:29:13,00:29:15,We know they take especially interest in females when they're pregnant.
00:29:15,00:29:19,And there's a theory that's because they have care for the seed to use ulcer sound so
00:29:19,00:29:23,that they can do ulcer sound without having to make an appointment at a sonogram.
00:29:23,00:29:26,"What, so do they see them and go, ""Oh, it's a boy."""
00:29:26,00:29:27,[laughter]
00:29:27,00:29:28,They don't tell me.
00:29:28,00:29:29,Try not to look.
00:29:29,00:29:35,"I feel like we quite, in Dolphin Eska, that we quite rude actually to look at someone"
00:29:35,00:29:36,else's--
00:29:36,00:29:37,Don't look at my wife's stomach.
00:29:37,00:29:38,Yeah.
00:29:38,00:29:40,It's like having extra specs all the time.
00:29:40,00:29:41,Yeah.
00:29:41,00:29:45,Imagine taking a wife to the ulcer sound and it's just a dolphin.
00:29:45,00:29:46,Yeah.
00:29:46,00:29:47,"Be like, ""Oh, great."
00:29:47,00:29:48,"We're in good hands."""
00:29:48,00:29:49,[laughter]
00:29:49,00:29:53,"Except they're not, because we have this impression that dolphins are really nice."
00:29:53,00:30:01,"But some dolphins, some male bottom those dolphins, kill newborn calves, which is not nice."
00:30:01,00:30:02,Why do they do that?
00:30:02,00:30:03,They do it.
00:30:03,00:30:04,It's really grim actually.
00:30:04,00:30:08,They do it because it frees up the females for mating.
00:30:08,00:30:12,"Because if a female has a newborn calf, she will be looking after the calf for some years."
00:30:12,00:30:15,She won't be interested in having any more offspring.
00:30:15,00:30:20,Whereas if the males have killed off the calf then within a few months she might be ready
00:30:20,00:30:21,to mate again.
00:30:21,00:30:24,"I don't know if we would know this, but did they have to do it sort of behind while the"
00:30:24,00:30:25,mother's away on a trip?
00:30:25,00:30:26,No.
00:30:26,00:30:28,The mother's on a trip.
00:30:28,00:30:29,On a holiday.
00:30:29,00:30:30,"Well, baby settings go on."
00:30:30,00:30:31,"Yeah, presumably."
00:30:31,00:30:35,"They just kind of mob the mother, and so the mother will try to protect her calf and"
00:30:35,00:30:39,often will succeed in protecting her calf from the males and get away with them.
00:30:39,00:30:40,Yeah.
00:30:40,00:30:41,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:30:41,00:30:43,And then the mother's fine just to mate with that dolphin again.
00:30:43,00:30:44,"They get over it, don't they?"
00:30:44,00:30:45,Pretty fast in the animal world.
00:30:45,00:30:46,Yeah.
00:30:46,00:30:47,They've got to procreate in a much time.
00:30:47,00:30:48,It's not a healthy family situation.
00:30:48,00:30:49,Yeah.
00:30:49,00:30:50,It's not.
00:30:50,00:30:54,"Actually, I think bottlenose dolphins might be the bastards of the dolphin world, because"
00:30:54,00:30:58,actually this initial fact was about bottlenose and spotted dolphins looking out for each other's
00:30:58,00:31:02,"children, but the only instance they found is of spotted dolphins looking out to bottlenose"
00:31:02,00:31:04,"dolphins children, not the other way round."
00:31:04,00:31:08,"And actually, there's quite a lot of instances as well as them cooperating with each other's"
00:31:08,00:31:09,species wise.
00:31:09,00:31:12,Bottlenose dolphins will just force their way into a group of spotted dolphins and start
00:31:12,00:31:15,"shagging the women in them, and there's nothing that the spotted can do because they're"
00:31:15,00:31:16,half the size.
00:31:16,00:31:17,Yes.
00:31:17,00:31:18,Yeah.
00:31:18,00:31:19,Yeah.
00:31:19,00:31:21,"So, actually, they're kind of bullies."
00:31:21,00:31:22,But bottlenose bullies.
00:31:22,00:31:27,There's evidence in marine research centres that kind of manage large areas of water with
00:31:27,00:31:32,lots of species in that when dolphins get bored of all the human toys and things that they
00:31:32,00:31:35,"use baby sharks as volleyballs, which is definitely bullying."
00:31:35,00:31:42,"Well, that's how dolphins kill baby dolphin calves, is they toss them out of the water, or"
00:31:42,00:31:46,"they will hold them under the water, because dolphins need to come up for it."
00:31:46,00:31:48,How have you guys heard of a dolphin?
00:31:48,00:31:51,"It's a whale dolphin, half whale, half dolphin."
00:31:51,00:31:52,It's amazing.
00:31:52,00:31:53,How big is it?
00:31:53,00:31:54,Is it a massive dolphin?
00:31:54,00:31:57,"It was in between the size of the two, because it was a pulse killer whale there."
00:31:57,00:32:00,I think that's slightly smaller than killer whales.
00:32:00,00:32:04,"It must be so bad for it, though, it's so awkward, like, who do you hang out with?"
00:32:04,00:32:06,"You're way too small for the whales, and you're way too big for the dolphins."
00:32:06,00:32:08,So let's sell it to Pixar.
00:32:08,00:32:15,"Sell it to Pixar, all right?"
00:32:15,00:32:18,"It's time for our final fact of the show, and that's my fact."
00:32:18,00:32:21,My fact this week is that Sylvester Stallone's mum is a bum-reader.
00:32:21,00:32:22,It's a bit harsh.
00:32:22,00:32:25,That's no way to squeak of that.
00:32:25,00:32:30,"This is something she is very proud of out, according to her website, which she has taken"
00:32:30,00:32:32,"down, and we had to search very hard to verify."
00:32:32,00:32:36,This is the kind of fact you get when James Hawking is away for a week in a podcast.
00:32:36,00:32:38,This is what slips through the net.
00:32:38,00:32:39,I know.
00:32:39,00:32:41,This is my only chance.
00:32:41,00:32:42,"This is called ""Rumpology."""
00:32:42,00:32:45,Why didn't they call it Astrology?
00:32:45,00:32:46,Oh!
00:32:46,00:32:47,Nice.
00:32:47,00:32:48,Yeah.
00:32:48,00:32:52,"Okay, so for anyone who hasn't heard of ""Rumpology"" or Astrology, the newly coined..."
00:32:52,00:32:53,"If it did, those people exist."
00:32:53,00:32:57,Surely everyone's familiar with the art.
00:32:57,00:33:03,"What they do is, ""Rumpologists look at people's bums, and they make predictions off the"
00:33:03,00:33:07,"back of the creases, off the back of any interesting..."
00:33:07,00:33:08,How many creases are there?
00:33:08,00:33:09,There's one.
00:33:09,00:33:10,Do you have...
00:33:10,00:33:11,Do you have to spread?
00:33:11,00:33:13,"Like, how much detail is this?"
00:33:13,00:33:14,"Well, depends how much..."
00:33:14,00:33:16,How far into the future you want to see.
00:33:16,00:33:19,The future is very dark.
00:33:19,00:33:21,"But yeah, so I was reading about this."
00:33:21,00:33:27,"I actually found out about this because I was emailing an author called David Bramwell,"
00:33:27,00:33:31,"who wrote an incredible book called ""Number 9 Bus"" to Utopia."
00:33:31,00:33:35,"And he's also the maker of a podcast in a live show called ""The Auditorium."""
00:33:35,00:33:39,"And so he puts on these nights, and he had a ""Rumpologist"" speak at one of his events,"
00:33:39,00:33:40,"and I thought, ""What the hell's a ""Rumpologist""?"
00:33:40,00:33:45,"Google it, found out that Jackie Stallone, Sylvester Stallone's mum, has done it."
00:33:45,00:33:48,"And she's done it to the point where, even on her website, again,"
00:33:48,00:33:51,this is quite hard to verify because it's been taken down.
00:33:51,00:33:56,"But suggestions, sort of little echoes of a past website through reading on Reddit"
00:33:56,00:33:57,and so on suggested.
00:33:57,00:34:03,"That she used to charge $600, and you would send a printed copy of your bum to her,"
00:34:03,00:34:06,"and she would read your bum digitally, as it were."
00:34:06,00:34:08,I love the printed copy of your bum.
00:34:08,00:34:10,But how does one print one's bum?
00:34:10,00:34:13,"Well, now with 3D printing, you probably can print your bum."
00:34:13,00:34:14,You probably can.
00:34:14,00:34:17,"Oh, I think that was the perfect excuse for all the office parties,"
00:34:17,00:34:20,whenever someone was called sitting on the copy machine.
00:34:20,00:34:24,"No, no, I want to know about my business prospect for the next year."
00:34:24,00:34:29,"But according to Wikipedia, Jackie Stallone has claimed to predict the outcome"
00:34:29,00:34:35,of presidential elections and the Oscar winners by reading the bottoms of her two pet doberman pensors.
00:34:35,00:34:37,So it doesn't need to work on animals as well?
00:34:37,00:34:40,"Yeah, she's reading animal bumps and bumps."
00:34:40,00:34:43,"And it doesn't seem it doesn't, so it's one thing to send your picture of your own bum"
00:34:43,00:34:44,and get your own future.
00:34:44,00:34:48,"But for some reason, these two dogs have the future presidential elections in them instead."
00:34:48,00:34:53,Sometimes it's just born lucky.
00:34:53,00:34:55,Like what are the odds of her having those dogs as well?
00:34:55,00:34:56,"Yeah, amazing."
00:34:56,00:35:03,"Yeah, Dan, you briefly read out from the Wikipedia on Rumpology just there,"
00:35:03,00:35:05,"which is surprisingly restrained, actually,"
00:35:05,00:35:07,and what it says about this ancient art.
00:35:07,00:35:10,But I did want to read out one paragraph from it.
00:35:10,00:35:16,"The American astrologer, Jackie Stallone, claims that Rumpology is known to have been practiced"
00:35:16,00:35:19,"in ancient times by the Babylonians, the Indians, and the ancient Greeks and Romans,"
00:35:19,00:35:22,although she provides no evidence for this claim.
00:35:22,00:35:26,"Stallone has been largely responsible for the supposed, quote marks,"
00:35:26,00:35:28,revival of Rumpology in modern times.
00:35:28,00:35:31,It's the most skeptical paragraph I've ever had about anything.
00:35:31,00:35:34,I do know it's going in and out of folk as well.
00:35:34,00:35:35,Yeah.
00:35:35,00:35:38,I don't even know the ancient Romans would have been in that time or there.
00:35:38,00:35:42,"Just to clarify how you print a bum, because I just feel like people are going to have been wondering."
00:35:42,00:35:43,Yeah.
00:35:43,00:35:45,"And she does tell you, did you see what she said you can do?"
00:35:45,00:35:46,No.
00:35:46,00:35:49,"You can henna your bum, and then you sit on a piece of papyrus."
00:35:49,00:35:52,"She says, because I guess she's trying to enhance the ancient origins of this factor."
00:35:52,00:35:58,"So you sit your hen at newly wet henna darts on a bit of papyrus,"
00:35:58,00:36:01,"and then you blow it dry or whatever, and send that off to her."
00:36:01,00:36:03,"And she can read the imprints, just doesn't even need the physical part."
00:36:03,00:36:04,That is fantastic.
00:36:04,00:36:07,"It's like potato prints, but with your arms."
00:36:07,00:36:10,"It's very skilled of her not to need the original bum, but it's amazing."
00:36:10,00:36:11,Isn't it incredible?
00:36:11,00:36:12,Yeah.
00:36:12,00:36:15,"I guess that's what you pay us $600 for, don't you?"
00:36:15,00:36:18,Where do you get papyrus these days?
00:36:18,00:36:20,"Is that written, is that in Rhymens?"
00:36:20,00:36:21,Is that readily available?
00:36:21,00:36:22,"Yeah, you're right."
00:36:22,00:36:23,It's hard.
00:36:23,00:36:24,It's next to the ATGSN.
00:36:24,00:36:26,It's an papyrus.
00:36:26,00:36:28,"Papyrus is really good, though."
00:36:28,00:36:30,"I mean, it lasts a lot longer than our paper."
00:36:30,00:36:34,"That means all the paper from our time of this current bit of history is going to go, except"
00:36:34,00:36:37,for these bits of papyrus that just have arse prints on them.
00:36:37,00:36:40,Little is known of the civilization of the early 21st century.
00:36:40,00:36:45,But they accurately predicted every single thing that has come to pass.
00:36:45,00:36:46,So here's the thing.
00:36:46,00:36:50,The ancient Babylonians also believed that you could predict the future.
00:36:50,00:36:52,And they believed it was by the liver.
00:36:52,00:36:55,That was the part of the body they thought was really significant.
00:36:55,00:36:59,But how do you know which bit of the liver means what?
00:36:59,00:37:01,They had a model liver.
00:37:01,00:37:10,"So you would kill a sheep, get out, get a special priest, get the liver out, and he had a special"
00:37:10,00:37:11,wooden liver.
00:37:11,00:37:13,Or there were even some special bronze livers.
00:37:13,00:37:17,"And it says, look, if this bit is discolored this way, then you're alcoholic, and then you're"
00:37:17,00:37:18,okay.
00:37:18,00:37:19,Yeah.
00:37:19,00:37:21,It's hepatology.
00:37:21,00:37:22,No.
00:37:22,00:37:23,Sorry.
00:37:23,00:37:24,Not hepatology.
00:37:24,00:37:25,I'm sorry.
00:37:25,00:37:27,That is the medical study of the liver.
00:37:27,00:37:28,It's not a hepatology.
00:37:28,00:37:30,I think that's going to be the thing that gets most feedback.
00:37:30,00:37:31,"Yeah, right."
00:37:31,00:37:35,And I'm not getting liver surgery in the next 10 years.
00:37:35,00:37:37,I'm going to correct it right now.
00:37:37,00:37:38,It's hepatoscopy.
00:37:38,00:37:44,"And it's a branch of haruspacy, which was the Babylonian Etruscan study of various organs"
00:37:44,00:37:46,which spelt out your future in some way.
00:37:46,00:37:48,"But yeah, it was really popular, wasn't it?"
00:37:48,00:37:50,A common way of telling the future.
00:37:50,00:37:57,"And in fact, an very famous example of haruspacy was in Caesar, Julia Caesar."
00:37:57,00:38:04,"So do you know the way the I'd of March was predicted was because of this practice, the"
00:38:04,00:38:08,"beware of the I'd of March, a famous see that Julia Caesar was told to do."
00:38:08,00:38:13,And he was told this by a haruspacist who is someone who looks at the entrails of animals
00:38:13,00:38:14,to tell the future.
00:38:14,00:38:18,"So I think it was the entrails of a sheep, which informed the haruspacist that to tell"
00:38:18,00:38:20,Caesar to beware the I'd of March.
00:38:20,00:38:22,And that was recorded by I think Suetonius.
00:38:22,00:38:27,"So here's the things, Isaac Newton himself did a lot of future predicting."
00:38:27,00:38:28,Yes.
00:38:28,00:38:33,And he was very interested in learning about the nature of God.
00:38:33,00:38:36,It's so contrary to the modern image of him.
00:38:36,00:38:39,He devised a chronology of all the great events before his life.
00:38:39,00:38:42,And then he did a chronology of the future as well.
00:38:42,00:38:47,So he predicted a thing called the tribulation of the Jews and he predicted a thousand years
00:38:47,00:38:50,of peace are going to begin in 2370.
00:38:50,00:38:52,And part of it was based on the life cycle of the locust.
00:38:52,00:38:57,"I mean, it was seriously out there, but that's also quite scientific in a way."
00:38:57,00:39:00,The idea of taking a load of dates and trying to find trends based on kind of things that
00:39:00,00:39:01,happen.
00:39:01,00:39:03,"No, that's the kind of thing that conspiracy theorists do."
00:39:03,00:39:04,It's not scientific.
00:39:04,00:39:07,"It's taking a load of data and making it find the trends that you want it to find, I think,"
00:39:07,00:39:08,or find.
00:39:08,00:39:13,"There is not finding evidence to making future predictions on say, you know, what's going"
00:39:13,00:39:14,to happen with climate change?
00:39:14,00:39:15,We're going to be based on past data.
00:39:15,00:39:16,Definitely.
00:39:16,00:39:17,But that is science also.
00:39:17,00:39:18,There's good ways and bad ways to do it.
00:39:18,00:39:19,But it's two sides of the same coin.
00:39:19,00:39:20,Yeah.
00:39:20,00:39:26,"I was reading about one of Thailand's leading fortune tellers, whose name is Luck Rakanethes"
00:39:26,00:39:30,"and he says that the fact that his name is Luck, which means Luck in English is complete"
00:39:30,00:39:31,coincidence.
00:39:31,00:39:36,"There was an interview with him recently where he runs this system now, which is not"
00:39:36,00:39:40,like a cool center where people just literally ring in and they get their horoscopes or they
00:39:40,00:39:43,get told what lottery numbers to chew or whatever.
00:39:43,00:39:48,"He's a multi-multimillionaire, so hundreds of thousands of people call him every month."
00:39:48,00:39:52,"And the way he did it was, he just memorized a bunch of astrology books when he was a child"
00:39:52,00:39:53,and then regurgitates it.
00:39:53,00:39:57,"But he spoke to Channel 4, I think, in the last couple of years."
00:39:57,00:40:01,"And Channel 4 asked him how he finds it, just reading people's futures and telling them"
00:40:01,00:40:03,what's going to happen to them.
00:40:03,00:40:05,"And he said, I want to change my life."
00:40:05,00:40:06,I'm not kidding.
00:40:06,00:40:11,"I'm so bored of going places with people shouting, teacher, look at my palm, tell me my fortune."
00:40:11,00:40:14,"He's basically completely, well, I don't think he ever believed it."
00:40:14,00:40:15,But he's now gone.
00:40:15,00:40:18,These people are all idiots who are asking me what's going to happen to them.
00:40:18,00:40:22,"And he acknowledges, there's no point in asking me if you're going to get rich."
00:40:22,00:40:24,You need to get rich using your own brains.
00:40:24,00:40:25,I can't tell you what's going to happen to you.
00:40:25,00:40:28,You actually have to just go out there and make it happen for yourself.
00:40:28,00:40:31,You should sell that device over the phone to people.
00:40:31,00:40:32,Yeah.
00:40:32,00:40:33,"Perhaps he is, yeah."
00:40:33,00:40:34,I don't think he made much money.
00:40:34,00:40:35,Press one for an angry rant.
00:40:35,00:40:36,Press two.
00:40:36,00:40:37,[laughs]
00:40:37,00:40:40,[music]
00:40:40,00:40:43,"Okay, that's it."
