1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,340
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,680
 - Hey everyone, Andy and Dan here.

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,520
 - Hello.

4
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,160
 - Before we, yep, there he is.

5
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,160
 So this week's episode,

6
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,680
 which I wanna let you know is a live recording.

7
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,160
 We did this a few weeks back at the London podcast festival

8
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,640
 and as Anna is away on maternity at the moment,

9
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,560
 we had a very exciting guest join us.

10
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,600
 And that was Richard Osman.

11
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,000
 - Yes, Richard is here, partly for the love of the game,

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,080
 but partly because he's also got a new book out.

13
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,160
 It is the fifth in the Thursday Murder Club series.

14
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,040
 If you haven't heard of this, I'm amazed

15
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,760
 'cause it is a global multi-million selling series.

16
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,240
 It's absolutely fantastic.

17
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,080
 I have read all four previous outings

18
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,060
 of the Thursday Murder Club.

19
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,000
 They're all great.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,280
 I cannot wait to get my tea stuck into the new one,

21
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,720
 which is out right now.

22
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,800
 It has just come out.

23
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,880
 It is called The Impossible Fortune

24
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,320
 and it's gonna be terrific.

25
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,160
 I know it.

26
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,520
 - Yeah, it really is an amazing series.

27
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,360
 I like Andy.

28
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,280
 I've read them all really excited for this one.

29
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,280
 And on top of it, you know,

30
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,320
 Richard arrives to do our show in the craziest of weeks

31
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,160
 because not only is his book coming out,

32
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,880
 but also the Thursday Murder Club

33
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,720
 has been converted into a movie.

34
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,840
 It's on Netflix.

35
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,240
 It stars Helen Mirren.

36
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,860
 It's got Pierce Brosnan.

37
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,920
 It's directed by Chris Columbus of Home Alone

38
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,760
 and Harry Potter.

39
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,240
 Spielberg's got his name as an exec.

40
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,120
 It's an amazing cast and collection of creatives.

41
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,340
 So if you wanna check out the first book in movie form,

42
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,440
 that's up now.

43
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,160
 - Yeah, but Dan, speaking of all this book stuff,

44
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,440
 are we going near any book world events anytime soon?

45
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,280
 - I believe we are, Andy.

46
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,480
 I believe we are back on stage live,

47
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,360
 doing something similar to what you are about to hear,

48
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,720
 except as it's in the future,

49
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,040
 you can come and be in the audience for it.

50
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,400
 It's the Cheltenham Literary Festival

51
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,960
 and we are gonna be doing it live

52
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,160
 with special guest, Rachel Parris.

53
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,480
 - Yes, it's gonna be on the 16th of October,

54
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,040
 8 p.m., Cheltenham, live, unplugged.

55
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,880
 We will be plugged in.

56
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,720
 There will be electrics.

57
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,840
 It's gonna be so much fun.

58
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,360
 You can get your ticket right now

59
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,560
 at no such thing as a fish.com/live,

60
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,120
 but hurry, tickets are going like hot books.

61
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,960
 - Hot books?

62
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,880
 - Yep.

63
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,860
 Just go along with it, mate.

64
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,000
 - All right, well listen, if you wanna see us live

65
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,800
 and you'll get a little taster of it now,

66
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,040
 go to the website as Andy says, book your tickets

67
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,760
 and join us in the room for the recording.

68
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,840
 So let's hear this one now.

69
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,920
 It is Richard Osman.

70
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,080
 We know such thing as a fish.

71
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,080
 On with the show.

72
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,920
 - Yay!

73
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,500
 (upbeat music)

74
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:32,080
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

75
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,200
 of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast,

76
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,640
 this week coming to you live

77
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,000
 from the London Podcast Festival.

78
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 (audience cheering)

79
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,840
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

80
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,840
 I am sitting here with James Harkin

81
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,480
 and Andrew Hunter Murray and Richard Osman.

82
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,040
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

83
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,760
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

84
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,040
 And in no particular order, here we go.

85
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,600
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Richard.

86
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,760
 - One nominee for best TV show at the first Emmys

87
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,800
 was the masked Spooner.

88
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,360
 It was like the masked singer,

89
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,960
 except the celebrity was spooning rather than singing.

90
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,480
 - So that was what year, Richard?

91
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,960
 - 1949.

92
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,760
 - And you've got to guess who's spooning you?

93
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,600
 - Yeah.

94
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,880
 - Which celebrity is spooning you?

95
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,720
 - Yeah.

96
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,280
 - It feels like a format that wouldn't get made these days.

97
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,560
 - Big spoon or a little spoon, do we know?

98
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,080
 - Spooning is sort of a misnomer.

99
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,760
 Nobody was cradling anybody at this stage.

100
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,120
 Spooning was a mixture of spoken word and crooning.

101
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,320
 So the masked Spooner, who is a, well,

102
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,720
 we'll get onto who it was

103
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,400
 because you had to try and guess who it was,

104
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,120
 but they never told you.

105
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,080
 And that's why the masked Spooner

106
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,640
 I think didn't do quite as well as the masked singer,

107
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,160
 because you'd have a whole episode.

108
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,160
 And at the end, you wouldn't have Jonathan Ross going,

109
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,000
 is it Bono?

110
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,960
 And then you go, no, it's former home secretary,

111
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,960
 Alan Johnson.

112
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,800
 (audience laughing)

113
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,080
 I should have sworn it was Bono.

114
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,800
 Next week, I bet it's Bono next week.

115
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,560
 No, it's someone from Emmerdale.

116
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,600
 - Yeah.

117
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,440
 - So he would essentially turn up at places

118
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,440
 and he would sing to people in a mask

119
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,720
 and you would constantly be asked who he was

120
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,920
 and you would go, oh, gosh, I bet it's Alan Ladd.

121
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,640
 And they go, no, guess again.

122
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,560
 Oh, I don't know any other celebrities from the 1940s.

123
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,800
 Well, unlucky.

124
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,720
 But then at the end they go, see you next week.

125
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,560
 - Wow.

126
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,480
 - And that was the masked Spooner.

127
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,040
 It won't surprise you to know it didn't win the Emmy.

128
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,240
 - Yes, it did not.

129
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,560
 Pantamime Quiz won the Emmy that year, I believe.

130
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,720
 - I don't know, it didn't.

131
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,960
 (audience laughing)

132
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,600
 - That was a charades thing, basically.

133
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,720
 So you would have two teams.

134
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,240
 There were four people in each team.

135
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,400
 Three of the members of one team would always be the same

136
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,640
 and they'd have a rotating guest

137
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,640
 and then you would have them acting out like charades.

138
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,160
 And 1949, that probably was mind-blowing.

139
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,840
 - Yeah, I mean, to have a rotating guest for a start.

140
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,800
 (audience laughing)

141
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,480
 They're like, they haven't seen that before.

142
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,320
 - These are-

143
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,560
 - Tied to a spit in the middle of the studio.

144
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,480
 - These are, by the way, the other shows

145
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,320
 that were nominated.

146
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,600
 You had Armchair Detective,

147
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,160
 which sounded really great, actually.

148
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,080
 I don't know if you read into that,

149
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,920
 but Armchair Detective-

150
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,800
 - Can I guess?

151
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,640
 - Yep.

152
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,440
 - Every crime, every week.

153
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,000
 Someone's been killed, but in a chair.

154
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,840
 - Yeah.

155
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,960
 - You're right so far.

156
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,480
 - Oh, no.

157
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,320
 - What, is he?

158
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,160
 - Okay, so someone's killed it.

159
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,800
 Great, just go with it, go with it.

160
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,400
 - I actually, that was just a pun you missed.

161
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,040
 You're right so far.

162
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,880
 You're right.

163
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,720
 I was just trying to-

164
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,560
 - Oh my God.

165
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,080
 - So it's, we're in Los Angeles.

166
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,160
 The city of sin.

167
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,480
 (audience laughing)

168
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,840
 - You see, and that's how you do a pun, Dan.

169
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,440
 - Yeah, yeah.

170
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,760
 - Well, it sounds like an Armchair Cop.

171
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,600
 - Yeah.

172
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,320
 - It's sort of a very specialized unit in the police,

173
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,160
 I would say.

174
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,560
 - What it was is, it was a show where they would put on

175
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,320
 a drama in which someone is murdered,

176
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,600
 and you at home had a chance to guess who it was.

177
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,320
 So, and they had a panel as well live who would sit there.

178
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,640
 So you would watch the drama,

179
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,240
 and then they would stop at a moment for you to deliberate,

180
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,240
 and then they would actually show you what happened.

181
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,400
 - Do you know what, there was an actual show on TV in Britain

182
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,840
 about two or three years ago with the exact same name

183
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,920
 and the exact same format

184
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,400
 that Susan Kalman hosted, wasn't it?

185
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,240
 - Correct.

186
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,080
 - Really?

187
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,160
 - Is there no such thing as a new idea, Richard?

188
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,600
 - Well, I would say that the mask spooner at the time

189
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,440
 was a new idea.

190
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,560
 (audience laughing)

191
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,200
 - But today, is it like a lot of the new formats,

192
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,960
 the kind of old formats that are--

193
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,800
 - Of course, yeah.

194
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,480
 People want something that's a tiny, tiny, tiny bit different

195
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,600
 to what they've seen before.

196
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,440
 - Right.

197
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,280
 - That's all you want.

198
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,480
 Like when the Traders comes out, every single channel goes,

199
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,800
 I tell you what people would like,

200
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,440
 something that's a bit like the Traders, but worse.

201
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,960
 (audience laughing)

202
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,720
 And that's how TV has always worked.

203
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,360
 When we did Deal or No Deal, my God, the next five years,

204
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,880
 some of the worst television programs

205
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,560
 in the history of the world came out,

206
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,400
 where people just went,

207
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,720
 "Oh, people just like random stuff, do they?"

208
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,560
 "Okay, we'll do that."

209
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,600
 And channel five did Heads or Tails,

210
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,120
 which is a whole week of Justin Lee Collins flipping a coin.

211
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,280
 (audience laughing)

212
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,400
 And then Simon Kal did the same thing with Red or Black,

213
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,160
 which was Choose Red or Choose Black,

214
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,200
 and I'll give you a million pounds.

215
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,800
 - Oh, that was Anton Deck?

216
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,040
 - Yeah, it was Anton Deck.

217
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,640
 It was a million pounds and still nobody watched.

218
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,800
 - Really? - Can you imagine?

219
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,640
 - Wow.

220
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,200
 - I watched a clip of that earlier today

221
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,680
 while researching this, and I found it compelling.

222
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,240
 I really, like, if I'd known at the time,

223
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,560
 I would have been hooked.

224
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,560
 - Well, no, but compelling in that sort of, you know,

225
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,720
 a Netflix documentary about a poop cruise,

226
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,920
 rather than I would love to watch this live.

227
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,740
 - Yeah.

228
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,000
 - Have you got some more of those?

229
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,240
 - Yeah, yeah, there was one called

230
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,760
 "What's the Name of That Song?"

231
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,600
 - Can you guess what that format was?

232
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,720
 (audience laughing)

233
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,720
 - God, I think you could do it.

234
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,040
 - I love that.

235
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,880
 - It was quite nice.

236
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,720
 The first ever Emmys,

237
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,600
 there was only about five awards that were given out,

238
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,280
 but the special award was my favorite.

239
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,360
 The special award went to Louis McManus,

240
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,120
 who was awarded the Emmy for designing the Emmy statue.

241
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,960
 - That's clever.

242
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,960
 - For the Emmy. - Oh, that's easy.

243
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,800
 - Yeah.

244
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,720
 - Does anyone know why the Emmys are called the Emmys,

245
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,540
 by the way?

246
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,200
 - Named after a person?

247
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,040
 - No.

248
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,880
 - Oh.

249
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,560
 - So we think, so the Tonys are named after a person.

250
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,120
 The Oscars are sort of named after,

251
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,400
 I mean, there's also several versions

252
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,240
 of why the Oscars are called the Oscars,

253
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,560
 but the Emmys, I thought maybe they'd be like M-E,

254
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,480
 or something like musical entertainment awards,

255
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,320
 but it's not, I'll tell you,

256
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:12,040
 there are, you know, the cathode ray in your television.

257
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,880
 They have the same sort of thing,

258
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,880
 but in video cameras,

259
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,200
 and there were two competing versions of this

260
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,960
 in the '30s and '40s, right?

261
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,400
 There was the RCA image orthicon tube,

262
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,800
 that was the first one,

263
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,920
 and then there was the EMI Emitron, okay?

264
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,240
 So we've got the RCA image orthicon tube

265
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,120
 and the EMI Emitron.

266
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,920
 Now, you've been doing this show long enough,

267
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,440
 but if I ask you the question,

268
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,680
 which of those two were the Emmys named after?

269
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,920
 (laughing)

270
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,400
 What would you go for?

271
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,240
 - I've got the Emitron.

272
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,120
 - The Emitron, yeah.

273
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,960
 - You'd be wrong.

274
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,480
 (laughing)

275
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,080
 It is named after the RCA image orthicon tube,

276
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,560
 which they used to call an EMI.

277
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,400
 So someone said, "Oh, we should call these the Emmys,"

278
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,760
 'cause that's the industry we're in.

279
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,600
 - Oh my God.

280
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,120
 - Because the Louis MacManus made the statue into a woman,

281
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,800
 they said, "Oh, why don't we call it EMI

282
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,640
 "instead of EMI?"

283
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,600
 So it became the Emmys.

284
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,440
 - Brilliant.

285
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,280
 - But named after the orthicon tube

286
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,840
 rather than the Emitron.

287
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,920
 (laughing)

288
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,160
 Which, by the way, was made by EMI, which also--

289
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,840
 - What it should have been called was the Dorothy,

290
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,160
 because that's who Louis modeled it after, his wife.

291
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,280
 - Oh, but everyone's always modeling after their wives,

292
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,120
 weren't they? - Yeah.

293
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,800
 - But all those statues, yeah.

294
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,120
 - I think the Rolls Royce is a bit racier.

295
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,000
 Isn't the Rolls Royce a mistress or something?

296
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,840
 - Yes.

297
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,640
 - Silver sprite figure on the front of a Rolls Royce.

298
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,480
 - Yes, yeah.

299
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,080
 - Isn't the Statue of Liberty like the face is his mother

300
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,680
 and the body is his wife?

301
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,000
 - Wow.

302
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,200
 - There's something like-- - What?

303
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,480
 - That is a very, very nice fetish, isn't it?

304
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,320
 - Yeah.

305
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,160
 (laughing)

306
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,000
 - And you know what?

307
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,600
 I'm gonna make a 200 feet high.

308
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,440
 - Yeah.

309
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,280
 (laughing)

310
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,360
 - I'm just, I'm sure we'll move on

311
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,600
 and talk about more TV formats and things like that,

312
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,800
 but I have a little quiz for you of spoon-related slang.

313
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,640
 - Oh.

314
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,880
 - 'Cause we were on the Masked Spooner.

315
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,720
 - The Masked Spooner.

316
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,040
 - Actual spoons.

317
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,400
 - Well, you'll see.

318
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,720
 (laughing)

319
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,720
 So part of the reason that the Masked Spooner

320
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,800
 was a bit cheeky was that spooning,

321
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,400
 to mean cuddling up to someone,

322
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,440
 was dates from 1887, I think.

323
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,320
 - Yeah, so he knew it was a double untied.

324
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,960
 - He knew it was a bit cheeky, yeah, yeah, yeah.

325
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,240
 And there are all these references.

326
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,000
 It's also a cricketing term dating back to 1836,

327
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,240
 meaning a weak stroke.

328
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,120
 But anyway, it's spooning dates to 1887.

329
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,640
 Now spoon me, Stirling stretched himself out

330
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,240
 on the warm flagstone and the boy nestled up against him.

331
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,240
 I don't know the context,

332
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,800
 I just know that that's what was happening.

333
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,640
 - Do you know what?

334
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,840
 That's my favorite of your novels.

335
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,480
 That is a bit cheap to promote it on the show, but...

336
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,960
 - Okay, to stick one spoon in the wall.

337
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,960
 What does that mean?

338
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,480
 - Are they from Urban Dictionary or something, so?

339
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,200
 - Are you sure it's not to stick one spoon in the walls?

340
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,600
 Because that's an ice cream reference, that's easier.

341
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,080
 That's much easier.

342
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,600
 To stick one spoon in the wall?

343
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,680
 - Yeah, to stick one spoon in the wall.

344
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,720
 - Is it to try and do something that's almost impossible?

345
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,880
 - No, it's very possible.

346
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,020
 We all do it.

347
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:53,860
 - Oh, we do?

348
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,700
 - Yeah.

349
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,560
 - Oh, is it like Shawshank Redemption?

350
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,400
 - Oh yeah.

351
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,280
 - Oh, it's older than that.

352
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,000
 It's from the 19th century, so it's pre-Shawshank.

353
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 - Okay.

354
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 - Shall I tell you?

355
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,840
 - Yeah, yeah.

356
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,160
 - It's to die.

357
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,000
 Oh.

358
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,880
 As you're doing on stage right now.

359
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,140
 (laughing)

360
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,800
 - Okay.

361
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,760
 - I'm not sure we even want round two.

362
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,560
 I'm not sure we've earned round two.

363
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,400
 - Definitely do.

364
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,440
 I mean, good luck topping that.

365
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,760
 - Yeah.

366
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,840
 - I put the strongest one first.

367
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,160
 (laughing)

368
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,280
 - To stick one spoon.

369
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,440
 I'd love it if a doctor ever said that you,

370
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,960
 Mr. Hunter Murray, I'm ever so sorry.

371
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,800
 We did everything we could,

372
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,160
 but I'm afraid your mother has stuck a spoon in the wall.

373
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,400
 (laughing)

374
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,320
 - Oh my God.

375
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,120
 - To fill the mouth with empty spoons.

376
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,880
 - To fill your mouth.

377
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,760
 - To fill the mouth with empty spoons.

378
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,600
 - False promises.

379
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,440
 - To waste your time.

380
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,280
 - False promises, wasting your time.

381
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,120
 - Wasting your time.

382
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,960
 - Lying.

383
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,780
 - Lying.

384
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,880
 It's someone in the audience said it's just being hungry.

385
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,720
 - Oh.

386
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,080
 - Weird, these didn't catch on.

387
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,920
 - Yeah.

388
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,720
 - Well, a spoon can also be a second rate coachman,

389
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,280
 a penis, a shovel, 1/16 of an ounce of heroin,

390
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,840
 or a newly qualified prison officer.

391
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,680
 - Okay.

392
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,520
 - Yeah.

393
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,760
 - There's lots of times where you can say

394
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,120
 stick in your spoon in the wall,

395
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,120
 and depending on which spoon you're talking about,

396
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,760
 it could mean something very true.

397
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,760
 - Very true.

398
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,440
 - Richard, just as someone who's created

399
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,680
 some of the most defining quizzes of our time.

400
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,040
 - And some of the worst, to be fair.

401
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:24,880
 - Okay.

402
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,080
 - Where does Andy's What's My Spoon rank on?

403
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,720
 - I would say fairly highly up,

404
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,560
 when I think of some of my stuff.

405
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,200
 I mean, yeah, it feels like maybe,

406
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,600
 I'm not sure it's a runner.

407
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,480
 Like series two, I don't think people are going,

408
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,040
 oh, I wonder what more spoon stuff

409
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,680
 Andrew has for us this week.

410
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,520
 - Yep.

411
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,360
 - That sort of work.

412
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,160
 But if you moved it out to other utensils,

413
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,920
 so the first one is what the spoon,

414
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,080
 second one, what the fork.

415
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,080
 - Yeah.

416
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,400
 - See, there's the fork.

417
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,520
 - We've got ourselves something.

418
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,960
 - It's not the end of your quiz, Andy.

419
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,800
 - I'm afraid.

420
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,640
 - Okay.

421
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,440
 - I just want to quickly say a little bit more

422
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,560
 about the Mask Spooner.

423
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,400
 - Yeah.

424
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,280
 - Because this was the kind of thing,

425
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,120
 it started off as a bit of a meme.

426
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,800
 So there was this guy who's going around like restaurants

427
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,680
 and bars and he was always wearing this outfit,

428
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,480
 which it's like got a mask on and he's got a hood.

429
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,920
 You can't really see what he is.

430
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,200
 And then all the Hollywood magazines started writing

431
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,040
 about him and saying,

432
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,040
 who is the Mask Spooner who's going around?

433
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,360
 And actually it became a bit of a thing

434
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,560
 where people guessing in magazines and newspapers

435
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,560
 who he was.

436
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,000
 And then the TV show was almost a spin-off.

437
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,840
 - Okay.

438
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,680
 - And yeah, and he got like,

439
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,640
 he was getting marriage proposals from people.

440
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,160
 And yet he never gave away the secret.

441
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,200
 And in the end, it felt like he was kind of holding on

442
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,640
 to give it away, give it away.

443
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,840
 But in the end, everyone just gave up

444
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,200
 and didn't really care anymore.

445
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,040
 - Yeah.

446
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:40,880
 - Do we know who he was?

447
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,720
 - We do know now, yeah.

448
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,120
 Because when he was going around to all these restaurants

449
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,920
 and the newspapers were writing about him,

450
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,200
 they heard about him from his friend called Jack Rook.

451
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,400
 And Jack Rook would say,

452
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:55,600
 oh, the Mask Spooner is going to be in the old bar

453
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,400
 in Soho tonight.

454
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,600
 And actually it was him.

455
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,760
 - Yeah.

456
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,600
 And here's the thing,

457
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,040
 Jack Rook was big in his own right at the time.

458
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,040
 He wasn't an anonymous character that you would just,

459
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,880
 when you heard his name,

460
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,280
 it was like Jack Rook,

461
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,880
 it'd be like saying Richard Osmond,

462
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,400
 he was a huge force in the world of entertainment in America.

463
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,360
 He effectively created,

464
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,380
 or at least popularized from massive scale, telephones.

465
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,600
 And I think the word itself was almost coined

466
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,920
 by Jack Rook, telephone.

467
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,760
 - I think it was, yeah.

468
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,240
 - The Mask Spooner invented telephones.

469
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,080
 - Yeah?

470
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,920
 - Yeah.

471
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,720
 - He also invented the political debate on camera,

472
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,560
 on screen.

473
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,120
 So when, was it Nixon?

474
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:32,960
 I think it was Nixon.

475
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,680
 - He did a big show with Nixon, yeah.

476
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,240
 - Yeah, big Nixon fan.

477
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,680
 - He did a telephone for Nixon

478
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,600
 and raised loads of money for his election.

479
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,160
 - Can I just say a sad thing about this though?

480
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,360
 In 1994, Jack Rook finally stuck his spoon in the wall.

481
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,940
 (all laughing)

482
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:52,020
 - Yeah.

483
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,020
 - It's gonna catch on.

484
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:53,860
 - Isn't it a shame?

485
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,700
 - It's gonna catch on.

486
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,820
 - I don't know how else to put it.

487
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,660
 (all laughing)

488
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,780
 - I was trying to find TV shows

489
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,300
 which have where everyone is in a mask,

490
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,420
 or someone is in a mask.

491
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,260
 - Oh yeah, that's it.

492
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,740
 - And there was an amazing TV show

493
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,140
 that you may or may not have heard of.

494
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,400
 It was called Mr. Personality, right?

495
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,140
 2003, American, it's a dating show.

496
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:14,620
 And there was one woman called Hailey Arp,

497
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:18,720
 who was going, she was wanting to get married,

498
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,600
 wanting to find love.

499
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,200
 And there were 20 suitors, guys,

500
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,960
 and they were trying to catch her eye

501
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,960
 and she was wanting to be picked by her in the show.

502
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,120
 But they were all wearing intense iron masks,

503
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:37,120
 or sometimes like rubbery, quite gimpy masks,

504
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,600
 throughout the series.

505
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,320
 - And was that her thing?

506
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,720
 - No, no, not at all.

507
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,020
 - It wasn't their thing either, like it was nobody's thing.

508
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:45,860
 - And it was-

509
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,700
 - Apart from one of them, one of them,

510
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,540
 was that your thing?

511
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,360
 (all laughing)

512
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,200
 So you go, do you know what,

513
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,220
 I might not go for number seven.

514
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,420
 He has been erected the entire series.

515
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:56,000
 (all laughing)

516
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,900
 - It was actually won by a man called Will Dick,

517
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,100
 funny you say that, but.

518
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,460
 (all laughing)

519
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,420
 And they were only allowed to remove their masks

520
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,900
 in a pitch black room and she would feel their faces

521
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,340
 and then they put the mask back on.

522
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,440
 Monica Lewinsky was the host, obviously.

523
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,280
 - No.

524
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,320
 - Wait, wait.

525
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,320
 I would like, and frankly,

526
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,040
 the second worst decision she's ever made

527
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,520
 was to host this show.

528
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,480
 And it was an absolute disaster.

529
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,320
 - Amazing.

530
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,560
 - The men didn't even know they were gonna be in masks

531
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,760
 until they turned up on the first day of shooting.

532
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,600
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

533
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,080
 - So can you pop this on for the next five weeks?

534
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,920
 - Right.

535
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,760
 - Disaster.

536
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,080
 - But they all would have said yes, they'd go,

537
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,200
 yeah, okay, that's the thing where people can't tell you.

538
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,080
 Especially in like 2003, anyone would have done anything.

539
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,920
 - Yeah.

540
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,760
 - Yeah, yeah.

541
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,960
 - We pretended to send people to space.

542
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,800
 The show called Space Cadets.

543
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,620
 - Were you part of that?

544
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,460
 - What was your show?

545
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,300
 - I mean, I wasn't.

546
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,140
 But was I part of it?

547
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:45,960
 That's a good question.

548
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,960
 What's your view on it?

549
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,840
 (audience laughing)

550
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,640
 No, I, with two of us, we're going,

551
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,880
 what's the biggest practical joke you could ever pull?

552
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,720
 - Yeah.

553
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,260
 - And we said, I wonder if you could convince people

554
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,760
 they'd ever been to space.

555
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,280
 And any time when we pitched it, they said,

556
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,820
 yeah, but sure, but you're not floating.

557
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,320
 And you go, yeah, you don't float in space

558
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,280
 'cause of the vacuum seal.

559
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,120
 They went, okay.

560
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,980
 (audience laughing)

561
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:06,940
 I'm like two weeks late to go.

562
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:07,780
 Is that true?

563
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,780
 You go, no, but you believed it.

564
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,360
 (upbeat music)

565
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:17,320
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two.

566
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,760
 And that is Andy.

567
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,440
 - My fact is, in 1990, most of the red kite birds

568
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,000
 in England had arrived here by British Airways.

569
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,040
 So this is about the red kite.

570
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,460
 This is a beautiful bird.

571
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,080
 And they're kind of all over the place these days.

572
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,000
 In the '90s, they were absolutely not.

573
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,480
 At the worst, I think they got down

574
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,680
 to like five breeding pairs in Wales.

575
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,980
 And you had to go to Central Wales

576
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,940
 to have even a sniff of a red kite.

577
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,580
 And they had this project, Mike Pionkowski was a guy

578
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,420
 from the Joint Nature Conservation Committee

579
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:50,300
 and his colleague Colin Galbraith and lots of colleagues.

580
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,820
 They knew this bird was declining a bit across Europe,

581
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,500
 but in England, there hadn't been any for about 400 years.

582
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,460
 - It was about to put its spoon bit in the wall.

583
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,300
 (audience laughing)

584
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,620
 - Oh my God.

585
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,460
 Oh my God.

586
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,300
 - Andy, lean into it.

587
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,380
 He's gonna get you a TV show under this.

588
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,700
 - You're right, you're right.

589
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,580
 And they thought, well, maybe we could restore them

590
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:10,320
 in England and they imported maybe a dozen

591
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,280
 from Navarra in Spain.

592
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,840
 And they arrived on British Airways.

593
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,320
 Amazingly, they were flown in the main cabin

594
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,520
 with paying customers.

595
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,240
 So as you got on, there was a load of boxes

596
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,040
 on the seats strapped in.

597
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,520
 Now that's a film, that's a film.

598
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,080
 - What, boxed red kites on a plane?

599
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,120
 - I think something happens, right?

600
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,120
 - It's not--

601
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,440
 - No, my film is about the conservation effort.

602
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,780
 It's like nothing happens.

603
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,340
 (audience laughing)

604
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,620
 And basically, the population has grown

605
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,780
 two and a half thousand percent since 1995.

606
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,780
 And it's a massive--

607
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,620
 - That's pretty good.

608
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,660
 - Now they're reaching seagull status

609
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,780
 in the rest of the country.

610
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,960
 - I read that they're getting to the point

611
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,260
 where schools aren't allowing the kids

612
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,780
 to eat lunch outside because they're swooping down

613
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,540
 and trying to steal their lunch.

614
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,540
 - Is that right?

615
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,660
 I read that when they did come over,

616
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,940
 they spread initially along the M40 corridor

617
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,100
 because there were so many dead animals

618
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:03,940
 by the side of the road.

619
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,600
 - And that's what they love to eat.

620
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,440
 - Yeah, they're scavengers, aren't they?

621
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,820
 - That's a lovely thought, isn't it?

622
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,120
 (audience laughing)

623
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,680
 - And the reason that there weren't so many of them

624
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,760
 is because they were all killed, basically, right?

625
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,520
 So they like to eat dead things,

626
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,480
 but if a farmer sees them eating like a dead lamb

627
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,760
 or something like that, they haven't killed the lamb,

628
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,880
 but the farmer thinks that they might have done.

629
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,120
 And so during the Tudor times,

630
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,400
 there was a thing called the Vermin Act of 1566.

631
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,080
 And that said that if you killed a red kite

632
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,180
 and you could prove it, you'd get some cash.

633
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,700
 And so people basically went out

634
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,660
 and killed as many of them as they could.

635
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,180
 And the idea was to help the farmers,

636
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,260
 but of course we now know

637
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,900
 that it didn't really help them at all.

638
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,260
 Also, if you killed a hedgehog,

639
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,060
 you could get up to four pence,

640
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,140
 which doesn't sound a lot,

641
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:49,780
 but that could buy you 20 pints of beer

642
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:52,300
 in Elizabethan prices for one hedgehog.

643
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,140
 - Really?

644
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:53,980
 - Wow.

645
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,620
 - Getting you a certain number of pints

646
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,860
 means nothing to me recently

647
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,420
 since I discovered weather spoons

648
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,260
 because up until recently,

649
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:04,200
 you could get a pint of Ruddles for 99p.

650
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,200
 99p.

651
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,600
 I could go to the bar with a 20 pound note

652
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,800
 and come back with 20 pints.

653
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,720
 - Or one hedgehog.

654
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,920
 (laughing)

655
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,760
 - Yeah.

656
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,160
 - Danny, have you taken another advertising gig

657
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,000
 on the side?

658
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,720
 - No.

659
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,280
 - But Ruddles is a fine, fine beer.

660
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,520
 (laughing)

661
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,360
 - And affordable.

662
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,200
 - Wow.

663
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,040
 - It's actually gone up controversially

664
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,200
 to like a pound 49 now or something like that.

665
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,000
 It's me and the other guys at 9 a.m.

666
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,740
 and the weather spoons are furious.

667
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,020
 (laughing)

668
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,140
 Anyway, back to Red Kites.

669
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:34,980
 - Yeah, sure.

670
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:35,820
 - Yeah.

671
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,100
 - That's the most animated I've seen Dan

672
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,340
 in any other side of the world.

673
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,460
 (laughing)

674
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,380
 Finally discover what he's interested in.

675
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,060
 (laughing)

676
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,860
 - Do you know one other thing Red Kites do?

677
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,940
 This is, no, there's been a big vote

678
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,540
 for wild swimming, as I'm sure you know.

679
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:54,740
 And a lot of people like to swim, oh, natural.

680
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,580
 - Where's this going?

681
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,060
 We know they can kill lambs.

682
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,820
 (laughing)

683
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,540
 They sometimes will steal your clothes

684
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,320
 if you're wild swimming in a river.

685
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,380
 They would nick your clothes to line their nest.

686
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,220
 - Oh yeah.

687
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,480
 - And then some Red Kite chick has a, you know,

688
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,220
 lovely pair of white fronts.

689
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,440
 - I've heard this.

690
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,640
 They found nests with a teddy bear's head in it,

691
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,000
 a tea towel in it.

692
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,200
 And in 2006, they found a nest

693
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,100
 with a St. George's flag in it.

694
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,340
 It might have been painted in by a local.

695
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,540
 (laughing)

696
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,320
 But it was discovered less than an hour

697
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,300
 before England's World Cup match against Paraguay.

698
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,820
 And so it hit the newspapers

699
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:35,120
 that this was very patriotic, Red Kite.

700
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,200
 - Did we win that match?

701
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,460
 - Against Paraguay, I can't, I think we did, yeah.

702
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,660
 - Do you know what their Latin name is?

703
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,500
 - Red Kite.

704
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,420
 - Yeah, it's Milvus Milvus.

705
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,780
 Do you know what Milvus means?

706
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,620
 - No.

707
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,460
 - Bird.

708
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,780
 (laughing)

709
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,260
 They're called Bird Bird.

710
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,580
 Linnaeus called them Falco Milvus,

711
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:56,140
 but then Milvus became its own genus.

712
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,240
 And so then it got renamed

713
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,280
 and Milvus was put in front of it.

714
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,760
 So they're Milvus Milvus.

715
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,600
 - That's very funny.

716
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,520
 - Yeah, Bird Bird.

717
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,460
 - Very good.

718
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,080
 - It is a problem, we should say.

719
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,800
 It's a great story of reintroduction

720
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,720
 of a really precarious species,

721
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,080
 but they are eating people's lunch,

722
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,160
 and that is a problem.

723
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,560
 Article this spring from the Henley Standard.

724
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,600
 Red Kite stole my hummus.

725
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,920
 (laughing)

726
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,760
 Jeff Hay, 72 years old,

727
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,320
 was having some nice hummus in his garden.

728
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:28,320
 And got swooped on, predated, and scratched.

729
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,060
 And it was the third time in five years

730
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,020
 that a Red Kite has snatched food from him

731
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:36,140
 while he was eating outside.

732
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,340
 - He sounds careless.

733
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:40,780
 - I got some stuff on things that have been on aeroplanes

734
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,900
 that feel quite out of place.

735
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:46,220
 I'm a big comedy fan, and Tony Hancock.

736
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,260
 You must have loved Tony Hancock growing up.

737
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:52,300
 - I mean, I'm not 70, but move on.

738
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,080
 - When did he die, when did he die?

739
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,520
 - I can't actually remember, I think.

740
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,640
 - It certainly was before I was 10.

741
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,480
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

742
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,360
 - No, sorry, I'm not suggesting that you saw it live.

743
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,640
 - I think Hancock's half hour was on TV

744
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,480
 when I was a kid for sure.

745
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,480
 - Yeah, I think a lot of us grew up on Hancock's half hour.

746
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,280
 - Yes, I don't think I grew up watching Hancock's half hour.

747
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,280
 - Sorry to--

748
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,120
 - No, good lesson to just say the fact

749
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,120
 and not accuse you of a childhood memory you don't have.

750
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,400
 So basically, Tony Hancock, for anyone

751
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,400
 who doesn't know him apparently--

752
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,120
 - Oh, Tony Hancock, I thought you meant Nick Hancock.

753
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:22,960
 I'm so sorry.

754
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,260
 - Tony Hancock was one of the great British comedians.

755
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,940
 - He was the one who said, in the blood donor,

756
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,940
 he said, you know, a pint that's nearly an arm full

757
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,780
 or something, right?

758
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,620
 - Yes.

759
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,220
 - He was the one who had an affair, wasn't he,

760
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:40,340
 with the wife of the guy he ran Oliver Bonus during COVID?

761
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,500
 Have I got it right now?

762
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,340
 - That's, yeah, you--

763
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,180
 - Is that the right Hancock?

764
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,020
 - Yeah, yeah.

765
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,580
 - That's the right Hancock.

766
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,060
 - I think, "What's My Hancock?"

767
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,620
 Could be the next game show, I think.

768
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,460
 - There you go.

769
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,940
 (audience laughing)

770
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,340
 - And it's called Hancock's Half Hour.

771
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,340
 It's a half hour format.

772
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,180
 - Oh my God.

773
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,020
 - Yes. - Roll it.

774
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:57,860
 - Roll it.

775
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:00,220
 So, he was what?

776
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,560
 - This had better be spectacular.

777
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,900
 (audience laughing)

778
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,380
 Given the investment we've all made.

779
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,220
 - Yeah.

780
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,260
 - If this was just Tony Hancock was once on a plane,

781
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,100
 it's just going to be very disappointing.

782
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,380
 (audience laughing)

783
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,540
 - Tony Hancock was coming back from Australia.

784
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,940
 He was sitting next to Willie Rushton who's another,

785
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,500
 you must have grown up on Willie Rushton, Richard.

786
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,340
 - See him, he, I did, he, I did.

787
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,900
 - And so they were sat on a plane

788
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,500
 and one of the stewards came over

789
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,020
 and said, "Mr. Hancock, you belong in first class."

790
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,140
 And so Hancock went to first class,

791
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,680
 but Willie Rushton stayed in economy.

792
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,580
 And the interesting thing about that is Hancock

793
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,020
 was dead at the time.

794
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,860
 So he, yeah. - Oh, what?

795
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,220
 - He had sadly passed away in Australia.

796
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,060
 He took his own life.

797
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,220
 He was quite a depressed character.

798
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,580
 And Willie Rushton happened to be in Australia

799
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,100
 and he was cremated.

800
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,960
 He was put in an urn and they bought him a seat in economy.

801
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,540
 And an air steward came over and said,

802
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,380
 "Someone would like to move seats to sit there."

803
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,980
 And they said, "You can't, this is Tony Hancock."

804
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,540
 And she said, "What the hell is he doing in economy?

805
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,100
 "He needs to be in first class."

806
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:05,060
 So she took him in an urn off to first class,

807
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,460
 while Willie Rushton just had to sit to a random person.

808
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:11,660
 So he went to pick up Tony Hancock at the end of the flight

809
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,940
 and there was a red rose and a little note saying,

810
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,740
 "Thank you for all the laughs on the seat next to it."

811
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,340
 Yeah. - That was quite good.

812
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,500
 That's annoying, isn't it? - Yeah, that was all right.

813
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,460
 - Same thing happened to Eric Morkham, didn't it?

814
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,060
 - Did it? - Eric and Urn, right?

815
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,220
 Yeah, flight together.

816
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:29,620
 - Come on guys, he's a guest.

817
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,260
 - Yeah.

818
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,100
 - Thank you, James.

819
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,460
 - Do you know what the world record is

820
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,860
 for the number of yaks on a Boeing 747?

821
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,780
 - Wow.

822
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,700
 - Eight.

823
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,860
 - Oh, it must be more.

824
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,060
 Nine.

825
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:43,900
 - Even higher.

826
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,420
 - Higher than a nine.

827
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,520
 - 14.

828
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,900
 - It's triple figures.

829
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:48,740
 - No.

830
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:53,740
 - Yes. - 116 yaks on a Boeing.

831
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,980
 - No.

832
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:55,820
 - Yeah, not for fun.

833
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:58,420
 It was for a relocation program, but it was, yeah.

834
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:00,700
 That was last year, so it feels like it's a beatable record.

835
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,180
 Like it feels like it's innovation in the space right now.

836
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:06,980
 - What's the fun version of that number of yaks on a plane?

837
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:09,780
 - Well, I'm scripting something.

838
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,900
 I don't wanna talk about it, but I...

839
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,940
 - Did they go in the seats?

840
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,780
 - Yep.

841
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,980
 (audience laughing)

842
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,540
 - Oh, did they go in the hold, I guess?

843
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,620
 - I think they always have to go in crates

844
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,700
 and custom-made crates and things.

845
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,660
 When you're moving like Megaforna, you have to,

846
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,740
 you have to do that.

847
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:29,540
 - Yeah, when you're moving in Megaforna, James.

848
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,380
 You have to...

849
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,220
 Do you know what?

850
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,060
 James is such an idiot.

851
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:32,900
 - I am like that.

852
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,740
 (audience laughing)

853
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:36,020
 - My God, have I ever met a man who knows less

854
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,780
 about moving Megaforna than James?

855
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,940
 (audience laughing)

856
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,620
 - Can I tell you something just to change the subject

857
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:42,900
 about moving Megaforna?

858
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,500
 (audience laughing)

859
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,060
 - So there's a company called Cargo Lux.

860
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,540
 It's a Luxembourg Guards company.

861
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:52,460
 And they have the tagline, "You name it, we fly it."

862
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,300
 And they fly...

863
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:56,380
 If you need a big animal moving from one place to another,

864
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,900
 these are the guys you go to.

865
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,100
 And a couple of years ago,

866
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:04,100
 they moved a beluga whale from China to Iceland.

867
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,180
 - Okay.

868
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,020
 - For fun?

869
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:06,860
 - Or...

870
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:09,860
 (audience laughing)

871
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:13,580
 - No, it was very serious.

872
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:16,780
 It was in a sanctuary, like an ocean sanctuary.

873
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,140
 They wanted to move it to Iceland

874
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:20,300
 where it could live in the wild.

875
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,460
 And to cut a long story short,

876
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,420
 they just put it in a big hammock

877
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,060
 and keep pouring water on it.

878
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:26,980
 - Yeah, okay.

879
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:30,140
 - But they did, they kept it in very, very cold water

880
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,500
 for a couple of months beforehand.

881
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,660
 So it's blubber would get thicker for the journey because...

882
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,300
 - 'Cause it's cold on a plane?

883
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,740
 - Yeah, well, you have to keep your...

884
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,980
 You have to regulate your temperature

885
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:39,820
 and that's how they do it.

886
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:40,660
 - Yeah.

887
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,460
 And I guess it would be moving to colder waters as well,

888
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,380
 if it's going to say...

889
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,820
 - To Iceland, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

890
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,100
 It's just a thing that happened, but...

891
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,820
 And when they arrived in Keflavik,

892
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:52,700
 the locals gave them a salute of water,

893
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,500
 like they got hose pipes so that the plane could go

894
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,980
 through them, which sounds dangerous.

895
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,780
 Especially in Iceland.

896
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,660
 - Yeah, true, yeah.

897
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,220
 Just on reintroducing things.

898
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,060
 - Oh, yeah?

899
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:07,580
 - Would you guys like to see animals introduced to the UK?

900
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,300
 Show of cheers.

901
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,820
 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, which animals?

902
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,460
 And now we come to the meat.

903
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:16,980
 Okay, so animals that have gone extinct,

904
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,020
 that used to live in England,

905
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,540
 but have gone out of business here.

906
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,780
 - Okay.

907
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:21,780
 - Beavers.

908
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,380
 - Beavers!

909
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,620
 - That always gets a cheer.

910
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,780
 - I know, and beavers against?

911
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:29,900
 - Boo, no beavers.

912
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,700
 - Who would like moose back?

913
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,380
 - Boo!

914
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,700
 - Did we ever have moose?

915
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,740
 - We had moose.

916
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,580
 - Did we?

917
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,740
 - Yeah, we did.

918
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:42,100
 - So lots of people want beavers and like birds.

919
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,100
 37% of people want moose back.

920
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,020
 37% want wild boar.

921
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,660
 Can I have a cheer for wolves?

922
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:52,940
 I think that's more than beavers or moose.

923
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,700
 - That's a lot of people who don't live in houses

924
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,540
 made of straw.

925
00:28:55,540 --> 00:29:01,740
 - But 31% of people would be up for wild wolves in the UK,

926
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,620
 which I think I'm up for.

927
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,700
 Okay, what about bears?

928
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,380
 - And again, these are people who are not living

929
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,740
 with the consequences.

930
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:12,140
 - What about wasps?

931
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:16,300
 - You see?

932
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,060
 You know what I mean, they'd rather have bears than wasps.

933
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,980
 Honestly, I think a bear would ruin your picnic

934
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,740
 quicker than a wasp would, I think.

935
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:29,740
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

936
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,580
 and that is James.

937
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:35,380
 - Okay, my fact this week is that this year at Poundland,

938
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:39,100
 if you had one pound, you could buy a tin of Pilchats,

939
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:44,100
 a water pistol, or all 825 UK Poundland stores.

940
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:48,020
 - That's, yeah.

941
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,380
 - So yeah, I mean, you wouldn't be able to go in

942
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,100
 with your quid and say, can I have them?

943
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,940
 There has to be some lawyers involved in stuff,

944
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:57,940
 but the fact is that Poundland was sold this year for one pound.

945
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,860
 - Wow, plus 10p for the bag.

946
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:04,380
 - And this is the thing,

947
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:07,820
 like it's a thing in UK law if you want to buy a company,

948
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:10,020
 and let's say they have loads and loads of debts,

949
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,660
 so they're not really worth very much,

950
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,220
 but you want to buy the brand or whatever.

951
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,300
 In theory, you think you could just pay nothing for that

952
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,060
 because you know, you're taking on debt,

953
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:19,220
 but in that actual fact, you have to swap something

954
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,540
 between you in order for it to make a contract,

955
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:24,340
 and usually when they do that, they do one pound.

956
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,300
 And there's been lots of things that have been bought

957
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,140
 and sold for one pound.

958
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,740
 Ken Bates bought Chelsea Football Club for one pound

959
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:35,060
 in 1982, and then sold it to Roman Abramovich

960
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:40,060
 for £140 million, about 20 years later, so you know.

961
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:42,580
 - That's a good investment.

962
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,420
 - She is.

963
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:46,420
 - Probably could buy half a defender with that, couldn't you?

964
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,820
 - Portsmouth, Swansea City, Hull City, Bolton Wanderers,

965
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,140
 and Notts County have all been bought

966
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,100
 for one pound in their history.

967
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,420
 Notts County, the oldest football team as well.

968
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:57,180
 - Oh yes, Aston Villa, they were bought for a pound.

969
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,020
 - Were they?

970
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,300
 - Yeah, but if you buy a tin of Piltrons,

971
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:02,020
 no one says that does come with £200 million worth of debt.

972
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,900
 - Exactly, that is the difference.

973
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,420
 So yeah, they were sold by a Polish firm called PEPCO

974
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:11,420
 to a US investment firm called Gordon Brothers.

975
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,820
 - Do you know what's really sad about this?

976
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:17,820
 Is that I could buy 825 UK Poundland stores with my pound,

977
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:21,140
 yet I wouldn't be able to buy a single pint of Ruddles

978
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:25,740
 anymore because of this mad inflation that's gone on,

979
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,100
 this just pisses me off more.

980
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,860
 - That's devastating, yeah.

981
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,060
 Poundland is very interesting.

982
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:33,500
 The idea of setting up a shop where everything was a pound,

983
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,180
 and it did have to buckle because things did go up,

984
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,220
 so obviously things were more than a pound,

985
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,580
 but just the very idea of setting up a shop

986
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,020
 and going everything as a pound

987
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,660
 is a pretty remarkable thing.

988
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,740
 - Yeah, because a lot of things are a pound.

989
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,580
 - Right.

990
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:47,740
 - That's the clever thing about it.

991
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,580
 - Yeah.

992
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,420
 - You're going, "Oh my God, everything's a pound."

993
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,780
 You go, "Yeah, but I mean, they cost a pound."

994
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,740
 - Yeah, you're not selling iPads for a pound.

995
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,500
 - Yeah, exactly.

996
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,460
 - But Poundland was a bit of a Nepo store

997
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:01,020
 because they were founded with a 50K loan

998
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,460
 from a guy called Stephen Smith's father,

999
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:06,100
 who had, he had a cash and carry business,

1000
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,340
 and he gave his son a loan so that they could sell

1001
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,180
 this new company.

1002
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,540
 - A loan of one pound.

1003
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:13,940
 - But in fairness, the whole family had come

1004
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,060
 from a market stall background,

1005
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:19,020
 and the business idea for Poundland came

1006
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,620
 because on their market stall,

1007
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:23,020
 they had a box where everything was 10p,

1008
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,620
 and people would just go in and grab something

1009
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,700
 and put their 10p in the thing.

1010
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:28,740
 They thought we could make this a big thing.

1011
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,020
 And actually, I think in the UK,

1012
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,660
 there's quite a lot of companies,

1013
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:35,220
 especially supermarkets, that began in the markets.

1014
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,060
 - Yeah.

1015
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:36,900
 - Didn't they?

1016
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,780
 Tescos, Morrison's and Mark's and Spencer's

1017
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,980
 were all originally market stalls.

1018
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:41,900
 - Right.

1019
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,460
 - There's a Poundland Museum as well.

1020
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,340
 There's a Poundland Museum,

1021
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:48,540
 and even better than that, you can buy it if you want.

1022
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,820
 You can buy it for 4.25 million.

1023
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:54,780
 So Keith Smith, who set up Poundland with his son,

1024
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,980
 he went off to the Algarve after Steve Smith

1025
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:57,820
 was building this thing,

1026
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:59,340
 and he and his wife came back to England

1027
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,180
 and bought a house.

1028
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,020
 I've got the name of it.

1029
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:01,860
 - Lutstone Hall.

1030
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:04,140
 - Lutstone Hall, and in Lutstone Hall,

1031
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:07,700
 it has the Poundland Museum in one of the barns there.

1032
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,140
 And it's on the right move right now.

1033
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,420
 If you look at Cleverley in Shropshire,

1034
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:15,140
 you can take a look at Lutstone Hall.

1035
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,340
 There isn't actually a shot of the Poundland Museum.

1036
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,260
 - But I feel like they're tricking the buyer

1037
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,180
 because it's not only a Poundland Museum,

1038
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:23,100
 it's also a Lutstone Hall Museum.

1039
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,380
 So you've got all these amazing bits of archeology

1040
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,220
 that they've dug up,

1041
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:29,300
 sitting next to Poundland items, right?

1042
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,180
 But they say you get the house,

1043
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,860
 which is unbelievably beautiful,

1044
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,500
 but they're gonna take all of the stuff

1045
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,980
 in the Poundland Museum and bring it to headquarters.

1046
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:39,700
 So you actually don't get the Poundland Museum.

1047
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,380
 - I bet if I've made them an offer,

1048
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,060
 and I'd said I'm buying it,

1049
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,620
 but I want the Poundland Museum,

1050
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,780
 they go, "Yeah, fine."

1051
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,620
 Because it's still for sale.

1052
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,580
 It's been selling for a long time.

1053
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,100
 - Yeah, they've had to halve the price.

1054
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,260
 - So if I'm saying to them, full asking price.

1055
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,300
 - Is it you and me on Zoopla,

1056
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,540
 just constantly looking at this house?

1057
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,740
 - One other person interested, it says.

1058
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:00,140
 - It started at about 9.5 million, right?

1059
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,140
 Then it was down to 7.75.

1060
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,820
 Not that I'm obsessed with white move.

1061
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,860
 Now, as you say, it's about 4.5 million,

1062
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,380
 and it's a really nice house.

1063
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,900
 It's got one of those swimming pools

1064
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,020
 where you can put a dance floor over the top of it.

1065
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,620
 - And they actually, they reduced the price

1066
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,060
 over a Christmas period for a while,

1067
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,060
 thinking that that would be.

1068
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,380
 - What is going on, Dad?

1069
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,340
 (audience laughing)

1070
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,420
 - I didn't know you were so into this.

1071
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:22,700
 But if you said I want all the pound land stuff,

1072
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,140
 they're not gonna say no.

1073
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:26,460
 It's really important to us that that goes to our head office.

1074
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,260
 - Listen, if you wanna go halves, I am.

1075
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,260
 (audience laughing)

1076
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,100
 - Yeah, right.

1077
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:35,100
 - If you wanna go, let's readdress that balance.

1078
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,220
 - Yeah, let's do it.

1079
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:40,100
 - Richard, would you give a TV show

1080
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,820
 to the concept of Poundland?

1081
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,740
 Would you think that's a good TV show?

1082
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,500
 - Would you think that's a good TV show to make?

1083
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,860
 - Sorry, what are you talking about?

1084
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,020
 (audience laughing)

1085
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,620
 I've got a format called PoundShop Wars,

1086
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,780
 which is all about rivalry

1087
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:54,140
 between different kinds of PoundShop.

1088
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:55,540
 - Okay, that's different to what you said.

1089
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:58,020
 When you walked, when you walked in the room,

1090
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,540
 which was, would you like a game show?

1091
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,660
 And it's about Poundland.

1092
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,740
 (laughing)

1093
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,460
 - Sorry, because there was a real TV show

1094
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,780
 called PoundShop Wars.

1095
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,620
 - Wow. - Okay.

1096
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,220
 - And it sounds quite fun.

1097
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:10,140
 So I'm just gonna give you a few episode pictures

1098
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,500
 and see what you think of it, Richard.

1099
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,020
 - So someone's already made this.

1100
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:13,860
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

1101
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,140
 - So I might not buy it from you, but go on.

1102
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,100
 (audience laughing)

1103
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,340
 - When Poundland reduces its prices,

1104
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:22,860
 Pound World retaliates by launching the one-pound bra.

1105
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,540
 (audience laughing)

1106
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,500
 - Is that a weight thing or a price thing?

1107
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,900
 - It's a weight, a price.

1108
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,900
 (audience laughing)

1109
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,420
 - Rival stores compete for the crown

1110
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:35,060
 of best Halloween PoundShop in South Wales.

1111
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,820
 - No, I genuinely would like, I would watch that.

1112
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:37,660
 - Okay. - If I watched

1113
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,500
 the first two minutes of that,

1114
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,980
 it was on channel five, I think I even saw it.

1115
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:41,820
 - Oh, I'm not sure.

1116
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,860
 - Almost certainly with John Thompson doing the voiceover.

1117
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,300
 - Okay.

1118
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,420
 - It does sound good.

1119
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:49,500
 - Did they have any stuff about the 99p stores?

1120
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,580
 - No, absolutely not.

1121
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,420
 - No, really?

1122
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,260
 - No, that's good.

1123
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,100
 - I love it.

1124
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,700
 It tells you everything you ever need to know about economics.

1125
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,980
 You do not need to go to university.

1126
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:59,340
 You need to know that whenever a 99p store

1127
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,100
 opens next to a pound store,

1128
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,940
 it takes a lot of their business, right?

1129
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:03,780
 - Yeah.

1130
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,060
 - Poundland even bought the 99p stores

1131
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:10,260
 for 55 million pounds in 2015.

1132
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:13,940
 But then there was also when the 99p stores came out,

1133
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:17,380
 then you started getting 97p stores.

1134
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:20,380
 And in Barking in Essex, there was the 99p store.

1135
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:23,620
 And then on the same street opened a 97p store,

1136
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:26,580
 which had an introductory 95p sale.

1137
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:30,420
 - That's good.

1138
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,340
 - That's really good.

1139
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,660
 - Economics 101.

1140
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,700
 - Do you know who was the father,

1141
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,220
 kind of the father of all of this stuff?

1142
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:39,100
 So this is a guy called Frank Woolworth of Woolworth.

1143
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,460
 So he was the father of discount stores, basically.

1144
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,300
 - Where was he from?

1145
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,780
 'Cause you get that in multiple countries now.

1146
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,500
 - Yes, he was American.

1147
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,020
 Woolworth was a big brand in Britain as well

1148
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:49,580
 till it went bust, but he grew up in the States.

1149
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:53,620
 And there were already some budget stores in big cities.

1150
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,900
 And they were called Nickel and Dimes

1151
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,220
 'cause everything was either a nickel or a dime.

1152
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,860
 And he opened a thing called Woolworth's

1153
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:02,300
 great five cent store in Pennsylvania.

1154
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,180
 And it became unbelievably successful.

1155
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,260
 As in he had about a thousand branches.

1156
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,660
 No more, probably a couple of thousand

1157
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:10,180
 all across the States, went international.

1158
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:13,620
 And he took the opportunity to go absolutely bananas

1159
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,460
 with the money.

1160
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:18,180
 So he paid for the biggest building in New York to be built.

1161
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,820
 The tallest building in the world at that time

1162
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,180
 was the Woolworth building in New York.

1163
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,620
 And he paid cash for it.

1164
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:27,620
 He didn't muck around with mortgages or anything.

1165
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,860
 He just said, "I'm building, I'm commissioning this."

1166
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:32,940
 And then he became obsessed with Napoleon Bonaparte.

1167
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,820
 That was his thing.

1168
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:38,540
 So his private office, sort of 50 floors up here,

1169
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:41,620
 was an exact replica of Napoleon's private office

1170
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,220
 from his castle in France.

1171
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,860
 He would walk around his private estate

1172
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,420
 in an old Napoleon uniform,

1173
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:49,140
 like a legitimate old Napoleon uniform.

1174
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,900
 The gate of the estate is based on the Arc de Triomphe.

1175
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,940
 He bought Napoleon's old bed.

1176
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:56,060
 There was an old slave bed that Napoleon had had.

1177
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,540
 And there are rumors that he believed he was Napoleon.

1178
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,380
 - Okay.

1179
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,220
 - Towards the end.

1180
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,820
 - And you were saying he wasn't?

1181
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,020
 - I'm saying he--

1182
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,820
 - What evidence do you have that he wasn't?

1183
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:05,780
 Just out of interest.

1184
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,620
 - Do you know what?

1185
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,140
 He was also interested in time travel.

1186
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:10,260
 So that's a very good choice.

1187
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:13,540
 - He's here today.

1188
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,380
 - That's amazing.

1189
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:17,220
 - Frank Woolworth, just one of the most eccentric,

1190
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,100
 effectively pound-trop owners, you know.

1191
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,860
 - Do you know what is the biggest supermarket?

1192
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:26,500
 Fastest growing, let's say, grocery chain in the US today.

1193
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,820
 It's one you've heard of.

1194
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,300
 - Target, is that one in America?

1195
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,140
 - It's not Target.

1196
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,900
 It's one that's bigger in the UK.

1197
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,500
 And Europe, I should say.

1198
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,340
 - Lidl.

1199
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,340
 - Lidl's very close.

1200
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,620
 - Aldi. - Aldi is correct.

1201
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,060
 And so they're starting to learn

1202
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,820
 about the Isle of Shame now.

1203
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,660
 - Oh, sorry.

1204
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,180
 I thought that was Britain.

1205
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:47,180
 (audience laughing)

1206
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:53,740
 - For anyone who doesn't know the Isle of Shame,

1207
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,740
 this is the middle Isle of Aldi

1208
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:58,940
 where they just put some absolutely crazy things in there.

1209
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:01,260
 Basically, they do something called Overstock

1210
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:04,940
 where if a company has a lot of ironing boards

1211
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:05,980
 that they're trying to get rid of,

1212
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:08,260
 then Aldi will buy them all for really cheap

1213
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,340
 and then sell them in their shops.

1214
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:12,540
 So America is starting to find this.

1215
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,700
 And so if you go on the internet,

1216
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:14,820
 you get lots of people asking

1217
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:18,220
 what's the weirdest thing you've ever found in the Isle of Shame.

1218
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,940
 So things include bucket hats for dogs,

1219
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:25,180
 a light for the inside of your toilet bowl.

1220
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:27,500
 - Okay, hang on.

1221
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,340
 Let's pause on that.

1222
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,780
 - Okay.

1223
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:30,620
 - Yeah.

1224
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,460
 - So what's going on there?

1225
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,700
 - I would give you 400,000 pound

1226
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,380
 for 20% of this company.

1227
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:37,860
 (audience laughing)

1228
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,580
 - If you want to go to the toilet in the night.

1229
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,740
 - I think that's a brilliant idea.

1230
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,820
 - You might need something to aim at.

1231
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:43,820
 - What runway lights?

1232
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:44,660
 - In an airplane.

1233
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:45,500
 - Exactly.

1234
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,580
 - You know the airports didn't used to have those.

1235
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,780
 - Then I can get rid of the guy

1236
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:50,380
 with the ping pong bats in my toilet.

1237
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,220
 - But hang on.

1238
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:53,460
 You don't want to turn on your main bathroom light?

1239
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,460
 - What if the main bathroom is right next to the bedroom

1240
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:58,260
 and you don't want to wake up with your partner or whatever?

1241
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,860
 - That isn't you don't have a door.

1242
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,100
 (audience laughing)

1243
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,700
 - Sorry, we don't have doors there, all right?

1244
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,540
 - If you get up to go to the toilet in the night,

1245
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,860
 do you turn all the lights on?

1246
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:09,140
 - I just feel my way to the bathroom.

1247
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,540
 - That's really selfish if you do that.

1248
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,740
 - Hang on, no, I'm sorry.

1249
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,340
 (audience laughing)

1250
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:14,500
 I don't turn on the main light.

1251
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,940
 - I bet you flush as well, don't you?

1252
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:16,780
 - I do.

1253
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:17,620
 (audience laughing)

1254
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,980
 What I do is I get out of bed,

1255
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:21,140
 I go right up to my wife's ear and I go,

1256
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,580
 "Where's the toilet again?"

1257
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,900
 (audience laughing)

1258
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,020
 Hey, you would go into the toilet, it's a separate room.

1259
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:27,860
 You turn the light on.

1260
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:28,820
 - I'm so sorry, what on earth are you using

1261
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,500
 your iPhone light for?

1262
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,220
 - That's very personal a question.

1263
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,460
 (audience laughing)

1264
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:35,780
 - You don't turn the light on at night.

1265
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:38,820
 - You guys are nuts, what are you talking about?

1266
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:41,060
 It's in a different room altogether.

1267
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:43,980
 - Oh, well, someone's doing your life for himself.

1268
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:44,820
 - Oh, but to me.

1269
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:49,580
 - Ew, I'm just going to the West Wing to have a wee.

1270
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,100
 Fuck it, ow.

1271
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,540
 - Some of us are still on

1272
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:55,580
 the old trusty ceramic bowl under the bed.

1273
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:58,500
 (audience laughing)

1274
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,780
 - It's honestly like sitting next to Prince Andrew.

1275
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:04,300
 (audience laughing)

1276
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,300
 - All right, what else is there?

1277
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,140
 - What else is there?

1278
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:06,980
 - So that's a good, that's a good,

1279
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,700
 I think that's not an insane idea.

1280
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,860
 - None of these, like people bought these things.

1281
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,100
 Dessert, hummus.

1282
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:12,940
 - Dessert, hummus.

1283
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,060
 - Dessert, hummus.

1284
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:15,740
 It's made of chickpeas, but it's sweet.

1285
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:16,580
 - Oh, okay.

1286
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,900
 Are the red tights get pissed off

1287
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:20,820
 when they taste the difference?

1288
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,660
 - And then one person on Reddit,

1289
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:23,940
 when they asked what's the weirdest thing

1290
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,540
 you found in the Isle of Shame said,

1291
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:28,420
 "I work at Aldi, so my take is a bit different

1292
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,860
 "than the shopper, but the weirdest thing

1293
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,420
 "I have found in the Isle of Shame

1294
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:33,460
 "is a turd lying on the ground."

1295
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:37,140
 (audience laughing)

1296
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:37,980
 - And that's what happens

1297
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:40,380
 when you don't turn the lights on, so take it back.

1298
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:44,960
 (upbeat music)

1299
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:50,060
 - It is time for our final fact of the show,

1300
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,700
 and that is my fact.

1301
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:54,180
 My fact this week is that not long

1302
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:57,820
 after he released his song "All By Myself",

1303
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:00,380
 the musician Eric Carman was taken to court

1304
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,060
 because as it turned out,

1305
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:05,220
 he did not write it "All By Myself".

1306
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:08,100
 We all know the song, it was in Bridget Jones' diary.

1307
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:11,160
 Celine Dion covered it, it's a massive tune,

1308
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,460
 and Eric Carman put it on his debut album,

1309
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:15,700
 and he decided to incorporate

1310
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,460
 the second movement of a piece by Rachmaninov,

1311
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:20,700
 and he thought, because in America,

1312
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:21,860
 it was out of copyright,

1313
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:24,380
 that that would be the case globally, but it wasn't,

1314
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:27,180
 and so he had to give over 12%

1315
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:29,060
 of the royalties forever on,

1316
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:33,500
 and so Rachmaninov has a co-write credit on "All By Myself".

1317
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,340
 - Crazy.

1318
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:37,460
 I mean, it is in fairness, it is identical, isn't it?

1319
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,580
 - Yeah, and he wasn't trying to steal it,

1320
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:40,820
 it wasn't a plagiarism thing,

1321
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:42,300
 he thought it was out of copyright.

1322
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:45,260
 - Yeah, he was a massive Rachmaninov fan, I think,

1323
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:47,060
 and when they asked him about it, he said,

1324
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:49,940
 "I thought it's a crime that there are some spectacular

1325
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,820
 melodies in classical music

1326
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:54,740
 that the general public doesn't get exposed to."

1327
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:57,020
 But it turned out that the actual crime was plagiarism.

1328
00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:00,020
 (audience laughing)

1329
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:03,380
 - The irony of the title, that "All By Myself",

1330
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:05,900
 and he didn't write it all by himself,

1331
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:10,180
 reminds me of the absolute classic case of Gary Portnoy.

1332
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:12,580
 - I grew up with him, yes.

1333
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:13,420
 Who's that?

1334
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:14,260
 - I know the name.

1335
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:15,380
 - You know Gary Portnoy?

1336
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:16,300
 You know Gary Portnoy?

1337
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:19,700
 He's the man who wrote "When Everybody Knows Your Name".

1338
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:22,660
 - Oh, cheers. - The theme tune to "Cheers".

1339
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:25,140
 Yeah, which one of the most famous songs in our culture,

1340
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:26,980
 but no one knows who wrote it was Gary Portnoy.

1341
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:28,260
 - Yes, that's great.

1342
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:29,100
 - There you go.

1343
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:29,940
 - That's really good.

1344
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,260
 - James didn't know his name.

1345
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:33,780
 - I've heard the name before because I've watched every episode

1346
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,780
 about 20 times and it comes up, doesn't it?

1347
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:36,740
 - Gary Portnoy.

1348
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:38,140
 - Does this work when you're on quizzes,

1349
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:39,580
 if you just say, "Oh, I did know it"?

1350
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:40,540
 (audience laughing)

1351
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:42,300
 - Yeah, if you're honest.

1352
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:45,140
 - Yeah, there should be benefit of the doubt points

1353
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:46,380
 at the end of every round.

1354
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:47,300
 - Oh, I was gonna say that.

1355
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:48,580
 Well, if you were gonna say it,

1356
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:49,900
 then I'm gonna give you the points.

1357
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,140
 (audience laughing)

1358
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:52,820
 - I'm taking notes for "What's My Spoon",

1359
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:53,660
 don't worry guys.

1360
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:54,500
 (audience laughing)

1361
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,380
 So this is a really big thing in lots of songs.

1362
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:58,700
 There are songwriters who will get sued later on

1363
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:01,660
 because some similarity has been found.

1364
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:04,300
 So one of the most famous recent cases of that

1365
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:07,100
 was the song "Blurred Lines", if anyone remembers that.

1366
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:08,420
 - Friend of the podcast.

1367
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:10,820
 - Right, T.I. for over Williams and--

1368
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:11,660
 - Robin Thickey.

1369
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:12,540
 - Robin Thickey.

1370
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:13,380
 (audience laughing)

1371
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,900
 They had to pay.

1372
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,300
 (audience laughing)

1373
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:19,780
 They had to pay $5 million of the proceeds of "Blurred Lines",

1374
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:22,020
 which I mean, I'm naive about how much

1375
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:24,300
 an individual hit earns you, clearly.

1376
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:27,100
 They had to pay $5 million to Marvin Gaye's estate.

1377
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:31,660
 Not because of a particular melody or anything,

1378
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:34,300
 it was because of basically the feel of the song.

1379
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,140
 - The vibe.

1380
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:36,060
 - The vibe.

1381
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:37,780
 Like they had borrowed the vibe.

1382
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:39,460
 - To be fair, when you listen to it,

1383
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:41,300
 you can kind of see where they're coming from,

1384
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,220
 'cause it's like a kind of funky bass

1385
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:44,420
 and some cowbells and--

1386
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:47,140
 - Yeah, but I mean, that feels really harsh.

1387
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:47,980
 - I know.

1388
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:49,980
 - 'Cause they were going for a kind of old school funky hit.

1389
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:53,500
 - I think that one did feel like, that's an odd one.

1390
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:56,340
 'Cause there's very obvious ones where absolutely is the case.

1391
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:57,180
 - Completely.

1392
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:58,260
 - There was one that I read about, which was,

1393
00:44:58,260 --> 00:44:59,140
 I don't know if you all remember,

1394
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:01,980
 but Louise Redknapp had a song a long time ago

1395
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:03,260
 called "Naked".

1396
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:06,340
 The lyrics are, I could feel your eyes all over my body,

1397
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,300
 I can read the signs, they're sexual,

1398
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:10,540
 I can read your mind, I can see you want me.

1399
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:13,300
 And basically, someone effectively ripped

1400
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:18,100
 the entire melody and the bounce of the tempo of the song,

1401
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:20,660
 and they sued them, and so the co-writers of "Naked"

1402
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:22,740
 by Louise Redknapp are now the co-writers

1403
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:25,180
 of "Pepper's Party Time" from "Pepper Pig",

1404
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:28,860
 who sang a song about jumping in muddy puddles.

1405
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,140
 - Yeah, and again, it does sound,

1406
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:31,580
 if you listen to the both, it is-

1407
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:34,180
 - It's pretty much for much, lyrically as well, yeah.

1408
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:36,620
 (audience laughing)

1409
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:38,940
 - I was listening to one, "Viva La Vida" by Coldplay,

1410
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:41,380
 which I love, that's a Roman cavalry choirs

1411
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:42,460
 are singing all that kind of stuff.

1412
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:44,620
 There's a song by Joe Sattriani called "If I Could Fly",

1413
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:45,900
 and I was listening to the first minute of that,

1414
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:47,180
 I thought, "This is nothing like it."

1415
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:48,020
 And then it gets to a bit,

1416
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:50,540
 you go, "Oh, that is exactly like that song."

1417
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:51,580
 So, but that's called "If I Could Fly",

1418
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:53,660
 and I do a very brief sidebar,

1419
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:55,420
 because instead of putting in "If I Could Fly",

1420
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:56,540
 I put in "I Wish I Could Fly",

1421
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:59,260
 which is the Keith Harris and Orville song,

1422
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:00,180
 if anyone remembers that,

1423
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:02,620
 which is "I Wish I Could Fly" right up to the sky,

1424
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:04,500
 but I can't, Keith says, "You can."

1425
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:05,780
 It's called Orville's song,

1426
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:07,300
 and so I Googled Orville's song.

1427
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,900
 I originally wrote Orville's dong,

1428
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:10,740
 but,

1429
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:13,060
 (audience laughing)

1430
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:15,620
 fortunately, it said, "Do you mean Orville's song?"

1431
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:18,700
 But, so, a lot of people know,

1432
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,900
 a lot of people know the first verse of Orville's song.

1433
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:22,460
 The second verse, I think,

1434
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:24,300
 might be the bleakest thing

1435
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:27,980
 ever written in any medium, ever.

1436
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:29,260
 So, the first verse is, you know,

1437
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:30,940
 you have sort of a roughy no ear going,

1438
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:32,540
 "I wish I could fly right up to the sky,

1439
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:36,460
 "but I can't, Keith, you can, Orville, I can't.

1440
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,740
 "I wish I could see what folks see in me,

1441
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:43,180
 "but I can't, Keith, you can, Orville, I can't."

1442
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:45,300
 Second verse.

1443
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:49,420
 So, Orville, "I wish that I had a mom and a dad,

1444
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:51,180
 "but I don't.

1445
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:54,300
 "Keith, you don't, Orville, I don't."

1446
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:56,820
 (audience laughing)

1447
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:57,660
 And here we go.

1448
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:00,140
 Back to Orville.

1449
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:04,460
 "I'd like to pretend my sadness will end,

1450
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:05,300
 "but it won't.

1451
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:06,740
 (audience laughing)

1452
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:10,620
 "Keith, it will, Orville, it won't."

1453
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:13,060
 (audience laughing)

1454
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:14,500
 And that was number four.

1455
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,500
 That got to, that was like a big hit.

1456
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,340
 - Wow.

1457
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:19,620
 - I mean, that's quite something, isn't it?

1458
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:20,460
 - It's quite something.

1459
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:23,380
 - Yeah, "I'd like to pretend that my sadness will end."

1460
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:25,060
 I mean, that's like Iris Murdoch.

1461
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:26,020
 - Good Lord.

1462
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:28,460
 - They're the only people who've ever been allowed

1463
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:30,380
 to confer on Pointless Celebrities,

1464
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:31,580
 Keith Harris and Orville.

1465
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:32,420
 (audience laughing)

1466
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:33,260
 Very nice.

1467
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:34,100
 They came on together, we were like,

1468
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,220
 "Yeah, but this is fine."

1469
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:36,700
 (audience laughing)

1470
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:38,460
 None of us saw a problem with that.

1471
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:39,460
 (audience laughing)

1472
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:40,660
 - How did they do?

1473
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:41,620
 - They did great, actually,

1474
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:43,540
 'cause they were up against Tommy Cannon and Bobby Ball,

1475
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:46,260
 who scored 600 points in the first round.

1476
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:47,100
 - Wow.

1477
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:48,940
 - Which to this day is a Pointless Celebrities record.

1478
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:49,860
 - Wow.

1479
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:51,220
 - Taylor Swift.

1480
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:52,260
 - Oh, yeah.

1481
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:53,100
 - Singer.

1482
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:56,260
 So she has a song called "Look What You Made Me Do,"

1483
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:57,620
 which is a great song.

1484
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:59,140
 It's an absolute banger,

1485
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:01,820
 but it has a single cadence,

1486
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:04,100
 which was pretty much the same as one used in

1487
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:06,460
 Wright said, "Friends, I'm too sexy."

1488
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:07,300
 - Ah.

1489
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:09,460
 - Which was a really bad hit.

1490
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:10,900
 Like it was great, but it was sexy.

1491
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:11,740
 - I'm too sexy.

1492
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:12,740
 - Come on, mate.

1493
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:14,220
 - Okay, all right.

1494
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:15,500
 - I mean, it's no deeply dippy,

1495
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:16,340
 but it's not bad.

1496
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:18,260
 (audience laughing)

1497
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:20,660
 But basically, the writers of Wright said Fred,

1498
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:22,020
 or Wright said Fred themselves, I suppose,

1499
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:24,300
 have now got a credit on "Look What You Made Me Do,"

1500
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:25,780
 'cause their cadence ended up in it.

1501
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:27,060
 And this is a really common thing.

1502
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:29,780
 Like if a big star has a hit coming up,

1503
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:31,380
 or a song coming up for release,

1504
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:33,740
 like they'll have people check over it and they'll say,

1505
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:35,460
 "It's quite similar to this existing thing.

1506
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:37,180
 "Do you want to change a few notes?"

1507
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:40,140
 So people actively make the songs arguably worse,

1508
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:42,180
 'cause they'll say, "I'll just change these songs

1509
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:43,780
 "so it's not like, I don't know,

1510
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:45,740
 "yesterday," or whatever it is, you know.

1511
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:47,380
 - 'Cause there's only so many notes.

1512
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:48,780
 - I feel like it's all fine.

1513
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:50,260
 I feel like it's all fine to do.

1514
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,100
 - Do you?

1515
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:51,940
 - A lot of them.

1516
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:52,780
 - Thank you, your honor.

1517
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:53,780
 (audience laughing)

1518
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:55,820
 - No, but it's an interesting point because

1519
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:57,260
 the line that often gets said

1520
00:48:57,260 --> 00:49:00,300
 from the old generation of rock stars, John Lennon period,

1521
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:01,660
 they would say, "Steal from the best,"

1522
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:03,100
 and they did sometimes get busted,

1523
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:04,380
 but if you look at the modern--

1524
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:05,780
 - And busted are the best.

1525
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:06,620
 - Yeah.

1526
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:07,860
 (audience laughing)

1527
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:09,980
 And the modern crop, you've got Olivia Rodrigo,

1528
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:12,940
 who was sued multiple times for her debut album

1529
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:16,380
 by various people, but the old crop, Elvis Costello,

1530
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:18,500
 said, "No, go for it, this is great."

1531
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,500
 The strokes with their biggest hits,

1532
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,260
 that was a Tom Petty song,

1533
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:23,980
 almost literally ripped--

1534
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:25,420
 - Last night by the strokes.

1535
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,020
 - Yeah, exactly.

1536
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:28,860
 Did Petty, I don't think he ended up--

1537
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:29,700
 - I think he was called,

1538
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,500
 I think they came to an arrangement.

1539
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,340
 - Oh, okay.

1540
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:33,180
 - He was quite called about it.

1541
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:34,020
 - Yeah.

1542
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:35,300
 - So he wasn't, that's nice, he wasn't Petty.

1543
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:36,300
 Sorry, just to, like--

1544
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:37,660
 (audience laughing)

1545
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:41,100
 - Phil Manzanero, who was in Roxy Music,

1546
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,860
 every now and again, like he'd be sent a royalty check

1547
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:45,260
 for like 1.5 million pound,

1548
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:46,460
 and every time you'd have to go,

1549
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:48,340
 "Sorry, this is Ray Manzorak from The Doors."

1550
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:50,620
 This happens every now and again, so he sends it back,

1551
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:53,860
 then he gets a royalty check for 1.5 million dollars,

1552
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:55,420
 goes, "Sorry, this is Ray Manzorak."

1553
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:57,260
 They said, "Oh no, someone took a riff

1554
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:58,980
 "you did from a 1970s album,

1555
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:01,860
 "and it's on the new Kanye and Jay-Z album."

1556
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:03,420
 And so it was his money,

1557
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:05,620
 and he had just one of their kind of scouts,

1558
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:07,700
 found an old record, thought this is an amazing riff,

1559
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:09,860
 found out who'd done it, sent him the money.

1560
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:10,700
 - Wow.

1561
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:12,100
 - Yeah, it's worth having, isn't it?

1562
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:13,540
 - Yeah, that's great.

1563
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:17,300
 I found a really weird moment in pop history,

1564
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:20,700
 so Blame It On The Boogie was written by Michael Jackson,

1565
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:22,980
 a very different Michael Jackson,

1566
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:24,260
 who was also a singer,

1567
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:26,860
 who would trade under the name Mick Jackson,

1568
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:29,940
 but then it got taken to America via his people,

1569
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:31,660
 and it was played to a bunch of different people.

1570
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:34,660
 One of the people who heard it was the Jackson Five.

1571
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:36,100
 They recorded their own version,

1572
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:37,740
 and they released it in America.

1573
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:39,940
 Meanwhile, Mick Jackson is getting to release

1574
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:41,980
 his own version in England,

1575
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:45,260
 and no one knows who is who, because it's the same name.

1576
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:49,300
 BBC Radio One would only play the Jackson Five version,

1577
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:52,580
 whereas Capitol Radio would only play the Mick Jackson version,

1578
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:54,140
 and they were battling it out in the charts,

1579
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:56,380
 with people being confused about who is who.

1580
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:57,220
 - That's cool.

1581
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,580
 - It's just the most random name connection, yeah,

1582
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:00,420
 that you could get,

1583
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:02,780
 and he so happened to be an artist in his own right.

1584
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:03,620
 - Very cool.

1585
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:05,500
 All my stuff's about Rachmaninoff.

1586
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:08,380
 - Oh, let's hear about Rachmaninoff.

1587
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:09,220
 - He...

1588
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:10,180
 - Who did he rip off?

1589
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:11,020
 Doido.

1590
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:13,620
 (laughing)

1591
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:18,620
 - His first symphony, he played it to Rimsky-Korsakov.

1592
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:20,420
 He, like, went to the rehearsals,

1593
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:22,740
 and Rimsky-Korsakov said this,

1594
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:26,100
 "I do not find this music at all agreeable."

1595
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:28,260
 I was gonna translate it, this is shit,

1596
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:30,140
 but it was basically that's what he said.

1597
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:31,700
 Rachmaninoff suddenly thought,

1598
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:33,940
 oh my God, this isn't very good,

1599
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:35,100
 but he couldn't call it off,

1600
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:36,940
 so he spent the whole of the first symphony

1601
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:39,260
 hiding in a staircase backstage.

1602
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:40,580
 - Yeah, but then, like--

1603
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:41,420
 - Was it a success?

1604
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:43,340
 - Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.

1605
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:44,860
 It happened once.

1606
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:46,820
 The one reviewer wrote that,

1607
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:48,940
 "If the devil had written a symphony

1608
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:50,940
 "based on the 10 plagues of Egypt,

1609
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:52,860
 "and it was like Mr. Rachmaninoff's,

1610
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:54,860
 "then he would have fulfilled his task brilliantly

1611
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:57,180
 "and would delight the inhabitants of hell."

1612
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:00,020
 Three stars.

1613
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:01,660
 (laughing)

1614
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,780
 And Rachmaninoff refused to let anyone

1615
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:05,420
 perform it again in his lifetime,

1616
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:06,780
 and when he left Rush,

1617
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:08,860
 'cause he fled Rush and went to America afterwards,

1618
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:11,500
 and when he did that, he left his manuscript behind.

1619
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,540
 He just didn't want anything to do with it.

1620
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:14,460
 - Right. - Boy.

1621
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:15,300
 - Yeah.

1622
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,980
 - Was that the one that was used in All By Myself?

1623
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:18,820
 No, different one.

1624
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:19,660
 - No, no, no, no.

1625
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:22,460
 The one that All By Myself is his second symphony,

1626
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:23,940
 which is an absolute classic,

1627
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:26,700
 and which is regularly voted on Classic FM,

1628
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,540
 you know, our favorite symphony.

1629
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:30,220
 - But is that because most people listening are going,

1630
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:31,500
 oh, that's the Celine Dion song?

1631
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,980
 - Generally it is, I think it is, yeah.

1632
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:36,540
 Rachmaninoff, massive hands.

1633
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:37,740
 - Is that so?

1634
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:40,100
 - Yes, he can go 12 notes or something.

1635
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:41,140
 - He could do 12 notes,

1636
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:43,340
 but he could play a five note chord.

1637
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:44,460
 So it's not just reaching,

1638
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:45,500
 he could also play the first note.

1639
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:46,780
 - If he could play a chord.

1640
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:48,780
 - Yeah, he could play the first one,

1641
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:50,580
 and then the second one is 12 notes away,

1642
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:52,740
 and he could also play the three in between.

1643
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:55,460
 So that means your hand has to be even longer than the...

1644
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:56,940
 - But surely he's impossible to play then

1645
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:58,460
 for normal pianists with little fingers.

1646
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:00,900
 - Actually, I think that is a problem that,

1647
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:02,380
 like, people with smaller hands

1648
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:03,780
 find it difficult to play Rachmaninoff,

1649
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:06,060
 and also female pianists find it difficult

1650
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:07,540
 to play Rachmaninoff 'cause they, on average,

1651
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:08,380
 have smaller hands.

1652
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:09,220
 - Right. - Yeah.

1653
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:10,700
 - It's weird because this is, Richard,

1654
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:12,700
 you don't know the full history of our show,

1655
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:13,900
 but this is probably the third.

1656
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,140
 - I know the full history of your show.

1657
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:16,540
 - Okay, okay.

1658
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:19,300
 Then, as you will very well be aware of,

1659
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:21,700
 this is the third historical figure I found

1660
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:23,420
 who has massive hands.

1661
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:26,260
 George Eliot, the author.

1662
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:28,700
 Stonewall Jackson, the Confederate general.

1663
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:30,860
 He was convinced he had one giant arm,

1664
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:33,100
 so he used to go into battle on horse

1665
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:35,060
 with his arm in the air so he could distribute

1666
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:36,940
 all the blood that that was hogging

1667
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:38,620
 to the rest of his body.

1668
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:39,580
 This is now the third.

1669
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:41,540
 Rachmaninoff is in big hand territory,

1670
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:43,660
 big hand or not, the quiz.

1671
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:44,980
 - I got it, I got it.

1672
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:46,500
 They say that about Vladimir Putin.

1673
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,340
 Vladimir Putin, when he walks, you see,

1674
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:51,580
 he swings his left arm and he doesn't swing his right arm,

1675
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:54,060
 so his right arm stays absolutely by his side.

1676
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:56,620
 And for ages, people say that he's had a stroke,

1677
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:59,100
 something has happened with Vladimir Putin.

1678
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:01,700
 But you talk to anyone with any kind of knowledge of spying,

1679
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:05,220
 they go, no, that's KGB, 'cause that's where your gun is.

1680
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:06,900
 So you would never, you wouldn't be kind of doing that.

1681
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:08,220
 Always have your hand when it's your gun.

1682
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:09,220
 - No, fake arm, fake arm.

1683
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:10,620
 - No, no, it's real.

1684
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:14,900
 - No, shush, right hand is like holding the pistol.

1685
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:17,140
 And then you got the fake arm, and that happens.

1686
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:18,540
 - I'm with Andy, you see this all the time.

1687
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:20,340
 There's photos.

1688
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:22,420
 - But I don't think Putin has a fake arm,

1689
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:23,620
 that's what I'm saying.

1690
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:26,020
 - Well, agreed to disagree, but.

1691
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:29,780
 - I know he listens, so he probably can let us know.

1692
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:32,500
 - Guys, I was listening to the show.

1693
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,660
 I won't do the voice.

1694
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:36,340
 - That would be offensive, yeah.

1695
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:37,180
 - I think he's all right.

1696
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:40,500
 - Oh, I don't want to offend Putin, oh my goodness.

1697
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:43,300
 After all the good things he's done, no.

1698
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:45,700
 - We do need to wrap up, but you see photos now

1699
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:48,020
 where all the security detail that are walking around,

1700
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:50,820
 major prominent politicians and leaders,

1701
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:53,140
 have their hands just stuck in a position,

1702
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:55,620
 and it's because they're wearing underneath their jacket,

1703
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:58,900
 fake arms, while they hold a little gun.

1704
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:00,660
 - This is genuinely true.

1705
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:03,340
 - And it brings us back to Keith Harris, with Orville.

1706
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:04,180
 - He had a fake arm.

1707
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:05,780
 - Of course he did, because he's got one hand up,

1708
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:09,300
 Orville's, you know Orville wasn't real, right?

1709
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:10,140
 - Right.

1710
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:13,860
 - Yeah, you know it was Keith who wasn't able to pretend

1711
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:15,580
 that his sadness was going to end.

1712
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:16,420
 You know that, don't you?

1713
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:19,820
 - Are you saying that he was holding a gun inside or was?

1714
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:20,660
 - At all times.

1715
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:22,540
 - Was Orville working under duress?

1716
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:25,940
 - Yeah, I'll go on pointless with you, absolutely.

1717
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:27,380
 - Yeah, I wish I could fly right up to the sky,

1718
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:28,660
 you fucking won't in a minute, mate.

1719
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:31,660
 (audience laughing)

1720
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:36,400
 (upbeat music)

1721
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:41,020
 - That is it, that is all of our facts.

1722
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:42,860

1736
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:06,020
 - Yeah, and if you-- - What could that be?

1737
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:08,540
 An impossible fortune, huh?

1738
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:09,860
 You'll have to read it to find out.

1739
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:12,100
