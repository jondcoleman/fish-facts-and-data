00:00:00,00:00:01,(upbeat music)
00:00:01,00:00:03,"- Hey everyone, Andy and Dan here."
00:00:03,00:00:04,- Hello.
00:00:04,00:00:06,"- Before we, yep, there he is."
00:00:06,00:00:07,"So this week's episode,"
00:00:07,00:00:08,which I wanna let you know is a live recording.
00:00:08,00:00:11,We did this a few weeks back at the London podcast festival
00:00:11,00:00:13,"and as Anna is away on maternity at the moment,"
00:00:13,00:00:15,we had a very exciting guest join us.
00:00:15,00:00:17,And that was Richard Osman.
00:00:17,00:00:21,"- Yes, Richard is here, partly for the love of the game,"
00:00:21,00:00:24,but partly because he's also got a new book out.
00:00:24,00:00:27,It is the fifth in the Thursday Murder Club series.
00:00:27,00:00:30,"If you haven't heard of this, I'm amazed"
00:00:30,00:00:32,'cause it is a global multi-million selling series.
00:00:32,00:00:34,It's absolutely fantastic.
00:00:34,00:00:36,I have read all four previous outings
00:00:36,00:00:37,of the Thursday Murder Club.
00:00:37,00:00:38,They're all great.
00:00:38,00:00:40,"I cannot wait to get my tea stuck into the new one,"
00:00:40,00:00:41,which is out right now.
00:00:41,00:00:42,It has just come out.
00:00:42,00:00:44,It is called The Impossible Fortune
00:00:44,00:00:46,and it's gonna be terrific.
00:00:46,00:00:47,I know it.
00:00:47,00:00:49,"- Yeah, it really is an amazing series."
00:00:49,00:00:50,I like Andy.
00:00:50,00:00:52,I've read them all really excited for this one.
00:00:52,00:00:54,"And on top of it, you know,"
00:00:54,00:00:57,Richard arrives to do our show in the craziest of weeks
00:00:57,00:00:59,"because not only is his book coming out,"
00:00:59,00:01:00,but also the Thursday Murder Club
00:01:00,00:01:02,has been converted into a movie.
00:01:02,00:01:03,It's on Netflix.
00:01:03,00:01:05,It stars Helen Mirren.
00:01:05,00:01:06,It's got Pierce Brosnan.
00:01:06,00:01:08,It's directed by Chris Columbus of Home Alone
00:01:08,00:01:09,and Harry Potter.
00:01:09,00:01:11,Spielberg's got his name as an exec.
00:01:11,00:01:14,It's an amazing cast and collection of creatives.
00:01:14,00:01:17,"So if you wanna check out the first book in movie form,"
00:01:17,00:01:18,that's up now.
00:01:18,00:01:22,"- Yeah, but Dan, speaking of all this book stuff,"
00:01:22,00:01:25,are we going near any book world events anytime soon?
00:01:25,00:01:26,"- I believe we are, Andy."
00:01:26,00:01:29,"I believe we are back on stage live,"
00:01:29,00:01:32,"doing something similar to what you are about to hear,"
00:01:32,00:01:33,"except as it's in the future,"
00:01:33,00:01:36,you can come and be in the audience for it.
00:01:36,00:01:38,It's the Cheltenham Literary Festival
00:01:38,00:01:39,and we are gonna be doing it live
00:01:39,00:01:42,"with special guest, Rachel Parris."
00:01:42,00:01:44,"- Yes, it's gonna be on the 16th of October,"
00:01:44,00:01:47,"8 p.m., Cheltenham, live, unplugged."
00:01:47,00:01:47,We will be plugged in.
00:01:47,00:01:48,There will be electrics.
00:01:48,00:01:49,It's gonna be so much fun.
00:01:49,00:01:51,You can get your ticket right now
00:01:51,00:01:53,"at no such thing as a fish.com/live,"
00:01:53,00:01:57,"but hurry, tickets are going like hot books."
00:01:57,00:01:57,- Hot books?
00:01:57,00:01:58,- Yep.
00:01:58,00:02:00,"Just go along with it, mate."
00:02:00,00:02:03,"- All right, well listen, if you wanna see us live"
00:02:03,00:02:04,"and you'll get a little taster of it now,"
00:02:04,00:02:07,"go to the website as Andy says, book your tickets"
00:02:07,00:02:09,and join us in the room for the recording.
00:02:09,00:02:10,So let's hear this one now.
00:02:10,00:02:12,It is Richard Osman.
00:02:12,00:02:14,We know such thing as a fish.
00:02:14,00:02:15,On with the show.
00:02:15,00:02:15,- Yay!
00:02:18,00:02:21,(upbeat music)
00:02:21,00:02:32,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:02:32,00:02:35,"of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast,"
00:02:35,00:02:36,this week coming to you live
00:02:36,00:02:39,from the London Podcast Festival.
00:02:39,00:02:42,(audience cheering)
00:02:42,00:02:46,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:02:46,00:02:48,I am sitting here with James Harkin
00:02:48,00:02:51,and Andrew Hunter Murray and Richard Osman.
00:02:51,00:02:54,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:02:54,00:02:56,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:02:56,00:03:00,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:03:00,00:03:03,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Richard."
00:03:03,00:03:06,- One nominee for best TV show at the first Emmys
00:03:06,00:03:08,was the masked Spooner.
00:03:08,00:03:11,"It was like the masked singer,"
00:03:11,00:03:14,except the celebrity was spooning rather than singing.
00:03:14,00:03:18,"- So that was what year, Richard?"
00:03:18,00:03:19,- 1949.
00:03:19,00:03:22,- And you've got to guess who's spooning you?
00:03:22,00:03:23,- Yeah.
00:03:23,00:03:24,- Which celebrity is spooning you?
00:03:24,00:03:25,- Yeah.
00:03:25,00:03:27,- It feels like a format that wouldn't get made these days.
00:03:27,00:03:29,"- Big spoon or a little spoon, do we know?"
00:03:29,00:03:32,- Spooning is sort of a misnomer.
00:03:32,00:03:36,Nobody was cradling anybody at this stage.
00:03:36,00:03:41,Spooning was a mixture of spoken word and crooning.
00:03:41,00:03:44,"So the masked Spooner, who is a, well,"
00:03:44,00:03:45,we'll get onto who it was
00:03:45,00:03:47,"because you had to try and guess who it was,"
00:03:47,00:03:49,but they never told you.
00:03:49,00:03:50,And that's why the masked Spooner
00:03:50,00:03:53,"I think didn't do quite as well as the masked singer,"
00:03:53,00:03:55,because you'd have a whole episode.
00:03:55,00:03:57,"And at the end, you wouldn't have Jonathan Ross going,"
00:03:57,00:03:58,is it Bono?
00:03:58,00:03:59,"And then you go, no, it's former home secretary,"
00:03:59,00:04:00,Alan Johnson.
00:04:00,00:04:03,(audience laughing)
00:04:03,00:04:05,I should have sworn it was Bono.
00:04:05,00:04:06,"Next week, I bet it's Bono next week."
00:04:06,00:04:08,"No, it's someone from Emmerdale."
00:04:08,00:04:09,- Yeah.
00:04:09,00:04:12,- So he would essentially turn up at places
00:04:12,00:04:14,and he would sing to people in a mask
00:04:14,00:04:16,and you would constantly be asked who he was
00:04:16,00:04:19,"and you would go, oh, gosh, I bet it's Alan Ladd."
00:04:19,00:04:21,"And they go, no, guess again."
00:04:21,00:04:24,"Oh, I don't know any other celebrities from the 1940s."
00:04:24,00:04:25,"Well, unlucky."
00:04:25,00:04:28,"But then at the end they go, see you next week."
00:04:28,00:04:29,- Wow.
00:04:29,00:04:30,- And that was the masked Spooner.
00:04:30,00:04:33,It won't surprise you to know it didn't win the Emmy.
00:04:33,00:04:35,"- Yes, it did not."
00:04:35,00:04:38,"Pantamime Quiz won the Emmy that year, I believe."
00:04:38,00:04:39,"- I don't know, it didn't."
00:04:39,00:04:41,(audience laughing)
00:04:41,00:04:44,"- That was a charades thing, basically."
00:04:44,00:04:46,So you would have two teams.
00:04:46,00:04:48,There were four people in each team.
00:04:48,00:04:50,Three of the members of one team would always be the same
00:04:50,00:04:51,and they'd have a rotating guest
00:04:51,00:04:54,and then you would have them acting out like charades.
00:04:54,00:04:57,"And 1949, that probably was mind-blowing."
00:04:57,00:04:59,"- Yeah, I mean, to have a rotating guest for a start."
00:04:59,00:05:00,(audience laughing)
00:05:00,00:05:02,"They're like, they haven't seen that before."
00:05:02,00:05:03,- These are-
00:05:03,00:05:04,- Tied to a spit in the middle of the studio.
00:05:04,00:05:06,"- These are, by the way, the other shows"
00:05:06,00:05:07,that were nominated.
00:05:07,00:05:08,"You had Armchair Detective,"
00:05:08,00:05:10,"which sounded really great, actually."
00:05:10,00:05:11,"I don't know if you read into that,"
00:05:11,00:05:11,but Armchair Detective-
00:05:11,00:05:12,- Can I guess?
00:05:12,00:05:13,- Yep.
00:05:13,00:05:15,"- Every crime, every week."
00:05:15,00:05:17,"Someone's been killed, but in a chair."
00:05:17,00:05:17,- Yeah.
00:05:17,00:05:18,- You're right so far.
00:05:18,00:05:20,"- Oh, no."
00:05:20,00:05:21,"- What, is he?"
00:05:21,00:05:22,"- Okay, so someone's killed it."
00:05:22,00:05:23,"Great, just go with it, go with it."
00:05:23,00:05:26,"- I actually, that was just a pun you missed."
00:05:26,00:05:28,You're right so far.
00:05:28,00:05:28,You're right.
00:05:28,00:05:29,I was just trying to-
00:05:29,00:05:30,- Oh my God.
00:05:30,00:05:33,"- So it's, we're in Los Angeles."
00:05:33,00:05:35,The city of sin.
00:05:35,00:05:37,(audience laughing)
00:05:37,00:05:39,"- You see, and that's how you do a pun, Dan."
00:05:39,00:05:41,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:05:41,00:05:43,"- Well, it sounds like an Armchair Cop."
00:05:43,00:05:44,- Yeah.
00:05:44,00:05:46,"- It's sort of a very specialized unit in the police,"
00:05:46,00:05:47,I would say.
00:05:47,00:05:49,"- What it was is, it was a show where they would put on"
00:05:49,00:05:51,"a drama in which someone is murdered,"
00:05:51,00:05:53,and you at home had a chance to guess who it was.
00:05:53,00:05:57,"So, and they had a panel as well live who would sit there."
00:05:57,00:05:58,"So you would watch the drama,"
00:05:58,00:06:02,"and then they would stop at a moment for you to deliberate,"
00:06:02,00:06:03,and then they would actually show you what happened.
00:06:03,00:06:06,"- Do you know what, there was an actual show on TV in Britain"
00:06:06,00:06:08,about two or three years ago with the exact same name
00:06:08,00:06:09,and the exact same format
00:06:09,00:06:11,"that Susan Kalman hosted, wasn't it?"
00:06:11,00:06:12,- Correct.
00:06:12,00:06:13,- Really?
00:06:13,00:06:15,"- Is there no such thing as a new idea, Richard?"
00:06:15,00:06:17,"- Well, I would say that the mask spooner at the time"
00:06:17,00:06:18,was a new idea.
00:06:18,00:06:19,(audience laughing)
00:06:19,00:06:22,"- But today, is it like a lot of the new formats,"
00:06:22,00:06:23,the kind of old formats that are--
00:06:23,00:06:24,"- Of course, yeah."
00:06:24,00:06:27,"People want something that's a tiny, tiny, tiny bit different"
00:06:27,00:06:28,to what they've seen before.
00:06:28,00:06:29,- Right.
00:06:29,00:06:30,- That's all you want.
00:06:30,00:06:31,"Like when the Traders comes out, every single channel goes,"
00:06:31,00:06:32,"I tell you what people would like,"
00:06:32,00:06:35,"something that's a bit like the Traders, but worse."
00:06:35,00:06:36,(audience laughing)
00:06:36,00:06:38,And that's how TV has always worked.
00:06:38,00:06:41,"When we did Deal or No Deal, my God, the next five years,"
00:06:41,00:06:42,some of the worst television programs
00:06:42,00:06:44,"in the history of the world came out,"
00:06:44,00:06:45,"where people just went,"
00:06:45,00:06:46,"""Oh, people just like random stuff, do they?"""
00:06:46,00:06:47,"""Okay, we'll do that."""
00:06:47,00:06:49,"And channel five did Heads or Tails,"
00:06:49,00:06:53,which is a whole week of Justin Lee Collins flipping a coin.
00:06:53,00:06:54,(audience laughing)
00:06:54,00:06:56,"And then Simon Kal did the same thing with Red or Black,"
00:06:56,00:06:58,"which was Choose Red or Choose Black,"
00:06:58,00:06:59,and I'll give you a million pounds.
00:06:59,00:07:00,"- Oh, that was Anton Deck?"
00:07:00,00:07:02,"- Yeah, it was Anton Deck."
00:07:02,00:07:04,It was a million pounds and still nobody watched.
00:07:04,00:07:05,- Really? - Can you imagine?
00:07:05,00:07:06,- Wow.
00:07:06,00:07:08,- I watched a clip of that earlier today
00:07:08,00:07:10,"while researching this, and I found it compelling."
00:07:10,00:07:13,"I really, like, if I'd known at the time,"
00:07:13,00:07:14,I would have been hooked.
00:07:14,00:07:16,"- Well, no, but compelling in that sort of, you know,"
00:07:16,00:07:18,"a Netflix documentary about a poop cruise,"
00:07:18,00:07:21,rather than I would love to watch this live.
00:07:21,00:07:22,- Yeah.
00:07:22,00:07:24,- Have you got some more of those?
00:07:24,00:07:26,"- Yeah, yeah, there was one called"
00:07:26,00:07:27,"""What's the Name of That Song?"""
00:07:27,00:07:29,- Can you guess what that format was?
00:07:29,00:07:30,(audience laughing)
00:07:30,00:07:31,"- God, I think you could do it."
00:07:31,00:07:33,- I love that.
00:07:33,00:07:33,- It was quite nice.
00:07:33,00:07:34,"The first ever Emmys,"
00:07:34,00:07:36,"there was only about five awards that were given out,"
00:07:36,00:07:38,but the special award was my favorite.
00:07:38,00:07:41,"The special award went to Louis McManus,"
00:07:41,00:07:46,who was awarded the Emmy for designing the Emmy statue.
00:07:46,00:07:46,- That's clever.
00:07:46,00:07:47,"- For the Emmy. - Oh, that's easy."
00:07:47,00:07:48,- Yeah.
00:07:48,00:07:50,"- Does anyone know why the Emmys are called the Emmys,"
00:07:50,00:07:51,by the way?
00:07:51,00:07:53,- Named after a person?
00:07:53,00:07:54,- No.
00:07:54,00:07:54,- Oh.
00:07:54,00:07:57,"- So we think, so the Tonys are named after a person."
00:07:57,00:07:59,"The Oscars are sort of named after,"
00:07:59,00:08:00,"I mean, there's also several versions"
00:08:00,00:08:02,"of why the Oscars are called the Oscars,"
00:08:02,00:08:05,"but the Emmys, I thought maybe they'd be like M-E,"
00:08:05,00:08:07,"or something like musical entertainment awards,"
00:08:07,00:08:08,"but it's not, I'll tell you,"
00:08:08,00:08:12,"there are, you know, the cathode ray in your television."
00:08:12,00:08:12,"They have the same sort of thing,"
00:08:12,00:08:13,"but in video cameras,"
00:08:13,00:08:16,and there were two competing versions of this
00:08:16,00:08:17,"in the '30s and '40s, right?"
00:08:17,00:08:22,"There was the RCA image orthicon tube,"
00:08:22,00:08:23,"that was the first one,"
00:08:23,00:08:27,"and then there was the EMI Emitron, okay?"
00:08:27,00:08:30,So we've got the RCA image orthicon tube
00:08:30,00:08:32,and the EMI Emitron.
00:08:32,00:08:33,"Now, you've been doing this show long enough,"
00:08:33,00:08:35,"but if I ask you the question,"
00:08:35,00:08:37,which of those two were the Emmys named after?
00:08:37,00:08:38,(laughing)
00:08:38,00:08:40,What would you go for?
00:08:40,00:08:41,- I've got the Emitron.
00:08:41,00:08:42,"- The Emitron, yeah."
00:08:42,00:08:42,- You'd be wrong.
00:08:42,00:08:45,(laughing)
00:08:45,00:08:48,"It is named after the RCA image orthicon tube,"
00:08:48,00:08:50,which they used to call an EMI.
00:08:50,00:08:52,"So someone said, ""Oh, we should call these the Emmys,"""
00:08:52,00:08:53,'cause that's the industry we're in.
00:08:53,00:08:54,- Oh my God.
00:08:54,00:08:57,"- Because the Louis MacManus made the statue into a woman,"
00:08:57,00:08:58,"they said, ""Oh, why don't we call it EMI"
00:08:58,00:08:59,"""instead of EMI?"""
00:08:59,00:09:00,So it became the Emmys.
00:09:00,00:09:01,- Brilliant.
00:09:01,00:09:02,- But named after the orthicon tube
00:09:02,00:09:03,rather than the Emitron.
00:09:03,00:09:04,(laughing)
00:09:04,00:09:08,"Which, by the way, was made by EMI, which also--"
00:09:08,00:09:09,"- What it should have been called was the Dorothy,"
00:09:09,00:09:13,"because that's who Louis modeled it after, his wife."
00:09:13,00:09:15,"- Oh, but everyone's always modeling after their wives,"
00:09:15,00:09:16,weren't they? - Yeah.
00:09:16,00:09:17,"- But all those statues, yeah."
00:09:17,00:09:20,- I think the Rolls Royce is a bit racier.
00:09:20,00:09:22,Isn't the Rolls Royce a mistress or something?
00:09:22,00:09:22,- Yes.
00:09:22,00:09:24,- Silver sprite figure on the front of a Rolls Royce.
00:09:24,00:09:25,"- Yes, yeah."
00:09:25,00:09:29,- Isn't the Statue of Liberty like the face is his mother
00:09:29,00:09:30,and the body is his wife?
00:09:30,00:09:32,- Wow.
00:09:32,00:09:33,- There's something like-- - What?
00:09:33,00:09:35,"- That is a very, very nice fetish, isn't it?"
00:09:35,00:09:36,- Yeah.
00:09:36,00:09:37,(laughing)
00:09:37,00:09:38,- And you know what?
00:09:38,00:09:39,I'm gonna make a 200 feet high.
00:09:39,00:09:40,- Yeah.
00:09:40,00:09:41,(laughing)
00:09:41,00:09:42,"- I'm just, I'm sure we'll move on"
00:09:42,00:09:44,"and talk about more TV formats and things like that,"
00:09:44,00:09:48,but I have a little quiz for you of spoon-related slang.
00:09:48,00:09:49,- Oh.
00:09:49,00:09:50,- 'Cause we were on the Masked Spooner.
00:09:50,00:09:51,- The Masked Spooner.
00:09:51,00:09:53,- Actual spoons.
00:09:53,00:09:54,"- Well, you'll see."
00:09:54,00:09:55,(laughing)
00:09:55,00:09:57,So part of the reason that the Masked Spooner
00:09:57,00:09:59,"was a bit cheeky was that spooning,"
00:09:59,00:10:01,"to mean cuddling up to someone,"
00:10:01,00:10:05,"was dates from 1887, I think."
00:10:05,00:10:07,"- Yeah, so he knew it was a double untied."
00:10:07,00:10:08,"- He knew it was a bit cheeky, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:10:08,00:10:10,And there are all these references.
00:10:10,00:10:13,"It's also a cricketing term dating back to 1836,"
00:10:13,00:10:14,meaning a weak stroke.
00:10:14,00:10:18,"But anyway, it's spooning dates to 1887."
00:10:18,00:10:20,"Now spoon me, Stirling stretched himself out"
00:10:20,00:10:23,on the warm flagstone and the boy nestled up against him.
00:10:23,00:10:24,"I don't know the context,"
00:10:24,00:10:25,I just know that that's what was happening.
00:10:25,00:10:26,- Do you know what?
00:10:26,00:10:28,That's my favorite of your novels.
00:10:28,00:10:32,"That is a bit cheap to promote it on the show, but..."
00:10:32,00:10:34,"- Okay, to stick one spoon in the wall."
00:10:34,00:10:35,What does that mean?
00:10:35,00:10:38,"- Are they from Urban Dictionary or something, so?"
00:10:38,00:10:41,- Are you sure it's not to stick one spoon in the walls?
00:10:41,00:10:43,"Because that's an ice cream reference, that's easier."
00:10:43,00:10:45,That's much easier.
00:10:45,00:10:46,To stick one spoon in the wall?
00:10:46,00:10:47,"- Yeah, to stick one spoon in the wall."
00:10:47,00:10:50,- Is it to try and do something that's almost impossible?
00:10:50,00:10:51,"- No, it's very possible."
00:10:51,00:10:53,We all do it.
00:10:53,00:10:53,"- Oh, we do?"
00:10:53,00:10:54,- Yeah.
00:10:54,00:10:56,"- Oh, is it like Shawshank Redemption?"
00:10:56,00:10:57,- Oh yeah.
00:10:57,00:10:59,"- Oh, it's older than that."
00:10:59,00:11:02,"It's from the 19th century, so it's pre-Shawshank."
00:11:02,00:11:03,- Okay.
00:11:03,00:11:04,- Shall I tell you?
00:11:04,00:11:04,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:11:04,00:11:07,- It's to die.
00:11:07,00:11:08,Oh.
00:11:08,00:11:11,As you're doing on stage right now.
00:11:11,00:11:14,(laughing)
00:11:14,00:11:15,- Okay.
00:11:15,00:11:17,- I'm not sure we even want round two.
00:11:17,00:11:19,I'm not sure we've earned round two.
00:11:19,00:11:20,- Definitely do.
00:11:20,00:11:21,"I mean, good luck topping that."
00:11:21,00:11:22,- Yeah.
00:11:22,00:11:24,- I put the strongest one first.
00:11:24,00:11:27,(laughing)
00:11:27,00:11:28,- To stick one spoon.
00:11:28,00:11:30,"I'd love it if a doctor ever said that you,"
00:11:30,00:11:31,"Mr. Hunter Murray, I'm ever so sorry."
00:11:31,00:11:32,"We did everything we could,"
00:11:32,00:11:35,but I'm afraid your mother has stuck a spoon in the wall.
00:11:35,00:11:37,(laughing)
00:11:37,00:11:41,- Oh my God.
00:11:41,00:11:44,- To fill the mouth with empty spoons.
00:11:44,00:11:45,- To fill your mouth.
00:11:45,00:11:47,- To fill the mouth with empty spoons.
00:11:47,00:11:48,- False promises.
00:11:48,00:11:49,- To waste your time.
00:11:49,00:11:50,"- False promises, wasting your time."
00:11:50,00:11:51,- Wasting your time.
00:11:51,00:11:51,- Lying.
00:11:51,00:11:52,- Lying.
00:11:52,00:11:54,It's someone in the audience said it's just being hungry.
00:11:54,00:11:55,- Oh.
00:11:56,00:11:58,"- Weird, these didn't catch on."
00:11:58,00:11:58,- Yeah.
00:11:58,00:12:02,"- Well, a spoon can also be a second rate coachman,"
00:12:02,00:12:06,"a penis, a shovel, 1/16 of an ounce of heroin,"
00:12:06,00:12:08,or a newly qualified prison officer.
00:12:08,00:12:09,- Okay.
00:12:09,00:12:10,- Yeah.
00:12:10,00:12:11,- There's lots of times where you can say
00:12:11,00:12:13,"stick in your spoon in the wall,"
00:12:13,00:12:15,"and depending on which spoon you're talking about,"
00:12:15,00:12:16,it could mean something very true.
00:12:16,00:12:17,- Very true.
00:12:17,00:12:19,"- Richard, just as someone who's created"
00:12:19,00:12:22,some of the most defining quizzes of our time.
00:12:22,00:12:24,"- And some of the worst, to be fair."
00:12:24,00:12:24,- Okay.
00:12:24,00:12:28,- Where does Andy's What's My Spoon rank on?
00:12:28,00:12:30,"- I would say fairly highly up,"
00:12:30,00:12:32,when I think of some of my stuff.
00:12:32,00:12:34,"I mean, yeah, it feels like maybe,"
00:12:34,00:12:35,I'm not sure it's a runner.
00:12:35,00:12:38,"Like series two, I don't think people are going,"
00:12:38,00:12:40,"oh, I wonder what more spoon stuff"
00:12:40,00:12:42,Andrew has for us this week.
00:12:42,00:12:43,- Yep.
00:12:43,00:12:44,- That sort of work.
00:12:44,00:12:47,"But if you moved it out to other utensils,"
00:12:47,00:12:48,"so the first one is what the spoon,"
00:12:48,00:12:50,"second one, what the fork."
00:12:50,00:12:51,- Yeah.
00:12:51,00:12:52,"- See, there's the fork."
00:12:52,00:12:53,- We've got ourselves something.
00:12:53,00:12:54,"- It's not the end of your quiz, Andy."
00:12:54,00:12:55,- I'm afraid.
00:12:55,00:12:56,- Okay.
00:12:56,00:12:58,- I just want to quickly say a little bit more
00:12:58,00:12:59,about the Mask Spooner.
00:12:59,00:13:00,- Yeah.
00:13:00,00:13:01,"- Because this was the kind of thing,"
00:13:01,00:13:03,it started off as a bit of a meme.
00:13:03,00:13:05,So there was this guy who's going around like restaurants
00:13:05,00:13:07,"and bars and he was always wearing this outfit,"
00:13:07,00:13:10,which it's like got a mask on and he's got a hood.
00:13:10,00:13:11,You can't really see what he is.
00:13:11,00:13:14,And then all the Hollywood magazines started writing
00:13:14,00:13:15,"about him and saying,"
00:13:15,00:13:18,who is the Mask Spooner who's going around?
00:13:18,00:13:19,And actually it became a bit of a thing
00:13:19,00:13:21,where people guessing in magazines and newspapers
00:13:21,00:13:22,who he was.
00:13:22,00:13:25,And then the TV show was almost a spin-off.
00:13:25,00:13:25,- Okay.
00:13:25,00:13:26,"- And yeah, and he got like,"
00:13:26,00:13:29,he was getting marriage proposals from people.
00:13:29,00:13:32,And yet he never gave away the secret.
00:13:32,00:13:35,"And in the end, it felt like he was kind of holding on"
00:13:35,00:13:36,"to give it away, give it away."
00:13:36,00:13:37,"But in the end, everyone just gave up"
00:13:37,00:13:39,and didn't really care anymore.
00:13:39,00:13:40,- Yeah.
00:13:40,00:13:40,- Do we know who he was?
00:13:40,00:13:41,"- We do know now, yeah."
00:13:41,00:13:44,Because when he was going around to all these restaurants
00:13:44,00:13:45,"and the newspapers were writing about him,"
00:13:45,00:13:50,they heard about him from his friend called Jack Rook.
00:13:50,00:13:51,"And Jack Rook would say,"
00:13:51,00:13:55,"oh, the Mask Spooner is going to be in the old bar"
00:13:55,00:13:57,in Soho tonight.
00:13:57,00:13:58,And actually it was him.
00:13:58,00:13:59,- Yeah.
00:13:59,00:14:00,"And here's the thing,"
00:14:00,00:14:03,Jack Rook was big in his own right at the time.
00:14:03,00:14:06,"He wasn't an anonymous character that you would just,"
00:14:06,00:14:06,"when you heard his name,"
00:14:06,00:14:08,"it was like Jack Rook,"
00:14:08,00:14:09,"it'd be like saying Richard Osmond,"
00:14:09,00:14:13,he was a huge force in the world of entertainment in America.
00:14:13,00:14:15,"He effectively created,"
00:14:15,00:14:18,"or at least popularized from massive scale, telephones."
00:14:18,00:14:20,And I think the word itself was almost coined
00:14:20,00:14:21,"by Jack Rook, telephone."
00:14:21,00:14:22,"- I think it was, yeah."
00:14:22,00:14:25,- The Mask Spooner invented telephones.
00:14:25,00:14:26,- Yeah?
00:14:26,00:14:26,- Yeah.
00:14:26,00:14:29,"- He also invented the political debate on camera,"
00:14:29,00:14:30,on screen.
00:14:30,00:14:32,"So when, was it Nixon?"
00:14:32,00:14:32,I think it was Nixon.
00:14:32,00:14:34,"- He did a big show with Nixon, yeah."
00:14:34,00:14:36,"- Yeah, big Nixon fan."
00:14:36,00:14:37,- He did a telephone for Nixon
00:14:37,00:14:39,and raised loads of money for his election.
00:14:39,00:14:42,- Can I just say a sad thing about this though?
00:14:42,00:14:46,"In 1994, Jack Rook finally stuck his spoon in the wall."
00:14:46,00:14:48,(all laughing)
00:14:48,00:14:52,- Yeah.
00:14:52,00:14:53,- It's gonna catch on.
00:14:53,00:14:53,- Isn't it a shame?
00:14:53,00:14:54,- It's gonna catch on.
00:14:54,00:14:55,- I don't know how else to put it.
00:14:55,00:14:57,(all laughing)
00:14:57,00:14:58,- I was trying to find TV shows
00:14:58,00:15:00,"which have where everyone is in a mask,"
00:15:00,00:15:01,or someone is in a mask.
00:15:01,00:15:02,"- Oh yeah, that's it."
00:15:02,00:15:03,- And there was an amazing TV show
00:15:03,00:15:05,that you may or may not have heard of.
00:15:05,00:15:07,"It was called Mr. Personality, right?"
00:15:07,00:15:11,"2003, American, it's a dating show."
00:15:11,00:15:14,"And there was one woman called Hailey Arp,"
00:15:14,00:15:18,"who was going, she was wanting to get married,"
00:15:18,00:15:19,wanting to find love.
00:15:19,00:15:23,"And there were 20 suitors, guys,"
00:15:23,00:15:25,and they were trying to catch her eye
00:15:25,00:15:28,and she was wanting to be picked by her in the show.
00:15:28,00:15:32,"But they were all wearing intense iron masks,"
00:15:32,00:15:37,"or sometimes like rubbery, quite gimpy masks,"
00:15:37,00:15:39,throughout the series.
00:15:39,00:15:41,- And was that her thing?
00:15:41,00:15:42,"- No, no, not at all."
00:15:42,00:15:45,"- It wasn't their thing either, like it was nobody's thing."
00:15:45,00:15:45,- And it was-
00:15:45,00:15:46,"- Apart from one of them, one of them,"
00:15:46,00:15:47,was that your thing?
00:15:47,00:15:48,(all laughing)
00:15:48,00:15:49,"So you go, do you know what,"
00:15:49,00:15:51,I might not go for number seven.
00:15:51,00:15:53,He has been erected the entire series.
00:15:53,00:15:56,(all laughing)
00:15:56,00:16:01,"- It was actually won by a man called Will Dick,"
00:16:01,00:16:03,"funny you say that, but."
00:16:03,00:16:05,(all laughing)
00:16:05,00:16:07,And they were only allowed to remove their masks
00:16:07,00:16:09,in a pitch black room and she would feel their faces
00:16:09,00:16:11,and then they put the mask back on.
00:16:11,00:16:13,"Monica Lewinsky was the host, obviously."
00:16:13,00:16:14,- No.
00:16:14,00:16:15,"- Wait, wait."
00:16:15,00:16:16,"I would like, and frankly,"
00:16:16,00:16:18,the second worst decision she's ever made
00:16:18,00:16:19,was to host this show.
00:16:19,00:16:22,And it was an absolute disaster.
00:16:22,00:16:23,- Amazing.
00:16:23,00:16:24,- The men didn't even know they were gonna be in masks
00:16:24,00:16:26,until they turned up on the first day of shooting.
00:16:26,00:16:27,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:16:27,00:16:29,- So can you pop this on for the next five weeks?
00:16:29,00:16:29,- Right.
00:16:29,00:16:30,- Disaster.
00:16:30,00:16:32,"- But they all would have said yes, they'd go,"
00:16:32,00:16:34,"yeah, okay, that's the thing where people can't tell you."
00:16:34,00:16:37,"Especially in like 2003, anyone would have done anything."
00:16:37,00:16:37,- Yeah.
00:16:37,00:16:38,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:16:38,00:16:40,- We pretended to send people to space.
00:16:40,00:16:41,The show called Space Cadets.
00:16:41,00:16:42,- Were you part of that?
00:16:42,00:16:43,- What was your show?
00:16:43,00:16:44,"- I mean, I wasn't."
00:16:44,00:16:45,But was I part of it?
00:16:45,00:16:45,That's a good question.
00:16:45,00:16:46,What's your view on it?
00:16:46,00:16:48,(audience laughing)
00:16:48,00:16:51,"No, I, with two of us, we're going,"
00:16:51,00:16:53,what's the biggest practical joke you could ever pull?
00:16:53,00:16:54,- Yeah.
00:16:54,00:16:56,"- And we said, I wonder if you could convince people"
00:16:56,00:16:57,they'd ever been to space.
00:16:57,00:16:59,"And any time when we pitched it, they said,"
00:16:59,00:17:00,"yeah, but sure, but you're not floating."
00:17:00,00:17:02,"And you go, yeah, you don't float in space"
00:17:02,00:17:03,'cause of the vacuum seal.
00:17:03,00:17:04,"They went, okay."
00:17:04,00:17:05,(audience laughing)
00:17:05,00:17:06,I'm like two weeks late to go.
00:17:06,00:17:07,Is that true?
00:17:07,00:17:08,"You go, no, but you believed it."
00:17:08,00:17:11,(upbeat music)
00:17:11,00:17:17,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two."
00:17:17,00:17:19,And that is Andy.
00:17:19,00:17:23,"- My fact is, in 1990, most of the red kite birds"
00:17:23,00:17:27,in England had arrived here by British Airways.
00:17:27,00:17:29,So this is about the red kite.
00:17:29,00:17:30,This is a beautiful bird.
00:17:30,00:17:32,And they're kind of all over the place these days.
00:17:32,00:17:34,"In the '90s, they were absolutely not."
00:17:34,00:17:35,"At the worst, I think they got down"
00:17:35,00:17:38,to like five breeding pairs in Wales.
00:17:38,00:17:39,And you had to go to Central Wales
00:17:39,00:17:41,to have even a sniff of a red kite.
00:17:41,00:17:45,"And they had this project, Mike Pionkowski was a guy"
00:17:45,00:17:47,from the Joint Nature Conservation Committee
00:17:47,00:17:50,and his colleague Colin Galbraith and lots of colleagues.
00:17:50,00:17:52,"They knew this bird was declining a bit across Europe,"
00:17:52,00:17:55,"but in England, there hadn't been any for about 400 years."
00:17:55,00:17:57,- It was about to put its spoon bit in the wall.
00:17:57,00:17:58,(audience laughing)
00:17:58,00:17:59,- Oh my God.
00:17:59,00:18:00,Oh my God.
00:18:00,00:18:01,"- Andy, lean into it."
00:18:01,00:18:02,He's gonna get you a TV show under this.
00:18:02,00:18:04,"- You're right, you're right."
00:18:04,00:18:06,"And they thought, well, maybe we could restore them"
00:18:06,00:18:10,in England and they imported maybe a dozen
00:18:10,00:18:12,from Navarra in Spain.
00:18:12,00:18:13,And they arrived on British Airways.
00:18:13,00:18:16,"Amazingly, they were flown in the main cabin"
00:18:16,00:18:18,with paying customers.
00:18:18,00:18:21,"So as you got on, there was a load of boxes"
00:18:21,00:18:23,on the seats strapped in.
00:18:23,00:18:25,"Now that's a film, that's a film."
00:18:25,00:18:28,"- What, boxed red kites on a plane?"
00:18:28,00:18:31,"- I think something happens, right?"
00:18:31,00:18:32,- It's not--
00:18:32,00:18:34,"- No, my film is about the conservation effort."
00:18:34,00:18:36,It's like nothing happens.
00:18:36,00:18:38,(audience laughing)
00:18:38,00:18:39,"And basically, the population has grown"
00:18:39,00:18:41,two and a half thousand percent since 1995.
00:18:41,00:18:42,And it's a massive--
00:18:42,00:18:43,- That's pretty good.
00:18:43,00:18:45,- Now they're reaching seagull status
00:18:45,00:18:46,in the rest of the country.
00:18:46,00:18:47,- I read that they're getting to the point
00:18:47,00:18:50,where schools aren't allowing the kids
00:18:50,00:18:52,to eat lunch outside because they're swooping down
00:18:52,00:18:54,and trying to steal their lunch.
00:18:54,00:18:55,- Is that right?
00:18:55,00:18:57,"I read that when they did come over,"
00:18:57,00:19:00,they spread initially along the M40 corridor
00:19:00,00:19:03,because there were so many dead animals
00:19:03,00:19:03,by the side of the road.
00:19:03,00:19:05,- And that's what they love to eat.
00:19:05,00:19:06,"- Yeah, they're scavengers, aren't they?"
00:19:06,00:19:07,"- That's a lovely thought, isn't it?"
00:19:07,00:19:09,(audience laughing)
00:19:09,00:19:11,- And the reason that there weren't so many of them
00:19:11,00:19:14,"is because they were all killed, basically, right?"
00:19:14,00:19:16,"So they like to eat dead things,"
00:19:16,00:19:19,but if a farmer sees them eating like a dead lamb
00:19:19,00:19:21,"or something like that, they haven't killed the lamb,"
00:19:21,00:19:23,but the farmer thinks that they might have done.
00:19:23,00:19:26,"And so during the Tudor times,"
00:19:26,00:19:29,there was a thing called the Vermin Act of 1566.
00:19:29,00:19:32,And that said that if you killed a red kite
00:19:32,00:19:34,"and you could prove it, you'd get some cash."
00:19:34,00:19:35,And so people basically went out
00:19:35,00:19:37,and killed as many of them as they could.
00:19:37,00:19:39,"And the idea was to help the farmers,"
00:19:39,00:19:40,but of course we now know
00:19:40,00:19:41,that it didn't really help them at all.
00:19:41,00:19:44,"Also, if you killed a hedgehog,"
00:19:44,00:19:46,"you could get up to four pence,"
00:19:46,00:19:47,"which doesn't sound a lot,"
00:19:47,00:19:49,but that could buy you 20 pints of beer
00:19:49,00:19:52,in Elizabethan prices for one hedgehog.
00:19:52,00:19:53,- Really?
00:19:53,00:19:53,- Wow.
00:19:53,00:19:55,- Getting you a certain number of pints
00:19:55,00:19:56,means nothing to me recently
00:19:56,00:19:58,since I discovered weather spoons
00:19:58,00:20:00,"because up until recently,"
00:20:00,00:20:04,you could get a pint of Ruddles for 99p.
00:20:04,00:20:06,99p.
00:20:06,00:20:08,I could go to the bar with a 20 pound note
00:20:08,00:20:10,and come back with 20 pints.
00:20:10,00:20:11,- Or one hedgehog.
00:20:11,00:20:12,(laughing)
00:20:12,00:20:13,- Yeah.
00:20:13,00:20:16,"- Danny, have you taken another advertising gig"
00:20:16,00:20:17,on the side?
00:20:17,00:20:18,- No.
00:20:18,00:20:21,"- But Ruddles is a fine, fine beer."
00:20:21,00:20:22,(laughing)
00:20:22,00:20:23,- And affordable.
00:20:23,00:20:24,- Wow.
00:20:24,00:20:25,- It's actually gone up controversially
00:20:25,00:20:27,to like a pound 49 now or something like that.
00:20:27,00:20:30,It's me and the other guys at 9 a.m.
00:20:30,00:20:31,and the weather spoons are furious.
00:20:31,00:20:33,(laughing)
00:20:33,00:20:34,"Anyway, back to Red Kites."
00:20:34,00:20:34,"- Yeah, sure."
00:20:34,00:20:35,- Yeah.
00:20:35,00:20:37,- That's the most animated I've seen Dan
00:20:37,00:20:38,in any other side of the world.
00:20:38,00:20:40,(laughing)
00:20:40,00:20:42,Finally discover what he's interested in.
00:20:42,00:20:44,(laughing)
00:20:44,00:20:45,- Do you know one other thing Red Kites do?
00:20:45,00:20:47,"This is, no, there's been a big vote"
00:20:47,00:20:50,"for wild swimming, as I'm sure you know."
00:20:50,00:20:54,"And a lot of people like to swim, oh, natural."
00:20:54,00:20:55,- Where's this going?
00:20:55,00:20:57,We know they can kill lambs.
00:20:57,00:20:58,(laughing)
00:20:58,00:21:01,They sometimes will steal your clothes
00:21:01,00:21:03,if you're wild swimming in a river.
00:21:03,00:21:05,They would nick your clothes to line their nest.
00:21:05,00:21:06,- Oh yeah.
00:21:06,00:21:08,"- And then some Red Kite chick has a, you know,"
00:21:08,00:21:10,lovely pair of white fronts.
00:21:10,00:21:11,- I've heard this.
00:21:11,00:21:14,"They found nests with a teddy bear's head in it,"
00:21:14,00:21:16,a tea towel in it.
00:21:16,00:21:18,"And in 2006, they found a nest"
00:21:18,00:21:20,with a St. George's flag in it.
00:21:20,00:21:23,It might have been painted in by a local.
00:21:23,00:21:25,(laughing)
00:21:25,00:21:27,But it was discovered less than an hour
00:21:27,00:21:30,before England's World Cup match against Paraguay.
00:21:30,00:21:31,And so it hit the newspapers
00:21:31,00:21:35,"that this was very patriotic, Red Kite."
00:21:35,00:21:36,- Did we win that match?
00:21:36,00:21:38,"- Against Paraguay, I can't, I think we did, yeah."
00:21:38,00:21:40,- Do you know what their Latin name is?
00:21:40,00:21:41,- Red Kite.
00:21:41,00:21:44,"- Yeah, it's Milvus Milvus."
00:21:44,00:21:45,Do you know what Milvus means?
00:21:45,00:21:46,- No.
00:21:46,00:21:47,- Bird.
00:21:47,00:21:48,(laughing)
00:21:48,00:21:51,They're called Bird Bird.
00:21:51,00:21:53,"Linnaeus called them Falco Milvus,"
00:21:53,00:21:56,but then Milvus became its own genus.
00:21:56,00:21:58,And so then it got renamed
00:21:58,00:21:59,and Milvus was put in front of it.
00:21:59,00:22:00,So they're Milvus Milvus.
00:22:00,00:22:01,- That's very funny.
00:22:01,00:22:02,"- Yeah, Bird Bird."
00:22:02,00:22:03,- Very good.
00:22:03,00:22:05,"- It is a problem, we should say."
00:22:05,00:22:06,It's a great story of reintroduction
00:22:06,00:22:08,"of a really precarious species,"
00:22:08,00:22:10,"but they are eating people's lunch,"
00:22:10,00:22:11,and that is a problem.
00:22:11,00:22:14,Article this spring from the Henley Standard.
00:22:14,00:22:16,Red Kite stole my hummus.
00:22:16,00:22:18,(laughing)
00:22:18,00:22:20,"Jeff Hay, 72 years old,"
00:22:20,00:22:23,was having some nice hummus in his garden.
00:22:23,00:22:28,"And got swooped on, predated, and scratched."
00:22:28,00:22:31,And it was the third time in five years
00:22:31,00:22:33,that a Red Kite has snatched food from him
00:22:33,00:22:36,while he was eating outside.
00:22:36,00:22:37,- He sounds careless.
00:22:37,00:22:40,- I got some stuff on things that have been on aeroplanes
00:22:40,00:22:42,that feel quite out of place.
00:22:42,00:22:46,"I'm a big comedy fan, and Tony Hancock."
00:22:46,00:22:48,You must have loved Tony Hancock growing up.
00:22:48,00:22:52,"- I mean, I'm not 70, but move on."
00:22:52,00:22:54,"- When did he die, when did he die?"
00:22:54,00:22:55,"- I can't actually remember, I think."
00:22:55,00:22:57,- It certainly was before I was 10.
00:22:57,00:22:58,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:22:58,00:23:01,"- No, sorry, I'm not suggesting that you saw it live."
00:23:01,00:23:04,- I think Hancock's half hour was on TV
00:23:04,00:23:05,when I was a kid for sure.
00:23:05,00:23:07,"- Yeah, I think a lot of us grew up on Hancock's half hour."
00:23:07,00:23:10,"- Yes, I don't think I grew up watching Hancock's half hour."
00:23:10,00:23:11,- Sorry to--
00:23:11,00:23:13,"- No, good lesson to just say the fact"
00:23:13,00:23:17,and not accuse you of a childhood memory you don't have.
00:23:17,00:23:19,"So basically, Tony Hancock, for anyone"
00:23:19,00:23:20,who doesn't know him apparently--
00:23:20,00:23:22,"- Oh, Tony Hancock, I thought you meant Nick Hancock."
00:23:22,00:23:22,I'm so sorry.
00:23:22,00:23:27,- Tony Hancock was one of the great British comedians.
00:23:27,00:23:29,"- He was the one who said, in the blood donor,"
00:23:29,00:23:32,"he said, you know, a pint that's nearly an arm full"
00:23:32,00:23:33,"or something, right?"
00:23:33,00:23:34,- Yes.
00:23:34,00:23:36,"- He was the one who had an affair, wasn't he,"
00:23:36,00:23:40,with the wife of the guy he ran Oliver Bonus during COVID?
00:23:40,00:23:42,Have I got it right now?
00:23:42,00:23:43,"- That's, yeah, you--"
00:23:43,00:23:44,- Is that the right Hancock?
00:23:44,00:23:45,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:23:45,00:23:46,- That's the right Hancock.
00:23:46,00:23:48,"- I think, ""What's My Hancock?"""
00:23:48,00:23:49,"Could be the next game show, I think."
00:23:49,00:23:50,- There you go.
00:23:50,00:23:52,(audience laughing)
00:23:52,00:23:54,- And it's called Hancock's Half Hour.
00:23:54,00:23:55,It's a half hour format.
00:23:55,00:23:56,- Oh my God.
00:23:56,00:23:57,- Yes. - Roll it.
00:23:57,00:23:57,- Roll it.
00:23:57,00:24:00,"So, he was what?"
00:24:00,00:24:02,- This had better be spectacular.
00:24:02,00:24:03,(audience laughing)
00:24:03,00:24:06,Given the investment we've all made.
00:24:06,00:24:07,- Yeah.
00:24:07,00:24:09,"- If this was just Tony Hancock was once on a plane,"
00:24:09,00:24:11,it's just going to be very disappointing.
00:24:11,00:24:12,(audience laughing)
00:24:12,00:24:14,- Tony Hancock was coming back from Australia.
00:24:14,00:24:16,"He was sitting next to Willie Rushton who's another,"
00:24:16,00:24:19,"you must have grown up on Willie Rushton, Richard."
00:24:19,00:24:22,"- See him, he, I did, he, I did."
00:24:22,00:24:23,- And so they were sat on a plane
00:24:23,00:24:27,and one of the stewards came over
00:24:27,00:24:31,"and said, ""Mr. Hancock, you belong in first class."""
00:24:31,00:24:33,"And so Hancock went to first class,"
00:24:33,00:24:35,but Willie Rushton stayed in economy.
00:24:35,00:24:37,And the interesting thing about that is Hancock
00:24:37,00:24:39,was dead at the time.
00:24:39,00:24:40,"So he, yeah. - Oh, what?"
00:24:40,00:24:43,- He had sadly passed away in Australia.
00:24:43,00:24:44,He took his own life.
00:24:44,00:24:45,He was quite a depressed character.
00:24:45,00:24:47,And Willie Rushton happened to be in Australia
00:24:47,00:24:49,and he was cremated.
00:24:49,00:24:51,He was put in an urn and they bought him a seat in economy.
00:24:51,00:24:53,"And an air steward came over and said,"
00:24:53,00:24:55,"""Someone would like to move seats to sit there."""
00:24:55,00:24:57,"And they said, ""You can't, this is Tony Hancock."""
00:24:57,00:24:59,"And she said, ""What the hell is he doing in economy?"
00:24:59,00:25:01,"""He needs to be in first class."""
00:25:01,00:25:05,"So she took him in an urn off to first class,"
00:25:05,00:25:08,while Willie Rushton just had to sit to a random person.
00:25:08,00:25:11,So he went to pick up Tony Hancock at the end of the flight
00:25:11,00:25:13,"and there was a red rose and a little note saying,"
00:25:13,00:25:16,"""Thank you for all the laughs on the seat next to it."""
00:25:16,00:25:18,Yeah. - That was quite good.
00:25:18,00:25:20,"That's annoying, isn't it? - Yeah, that was all right."
00:25:20,00:25:22,"- Same thing happened to Eric Morkham, didn't it?"
00:25:22,00:25:24,"- Did it? - Eric and Urn, right?"
00:25:24,00:25:25,"Yeah, flight together."
00:25:25,00:25:29,"- Come on guys, he's a guest."
00:25:29,00:25:31,- Yeah.
00:25:31,00:25:33,"- Thank you, James."
00:25:33,00:25:34,- Do you know what the world record is
00:25:34,00:25:36,for the number of yaks on a Boeing 747?
00:25:36,00:25:39,- Wow.
00:25:39,00:25:40,- Eight.
00:25:40,00:25:41,"- Oh, it must be more."
00:25:41,00:25:43,Nine.
00:25:43,00:25:43,- Even higher.
00:25:43,00:25:45,- Higher than a nine.
00:25:45,00:25:46,- 14.
00:25:46,00:25:47,- It's triple figures.
00:25:47,00:25:48,- No.
00:25:48,00:25:53,- Yes. - 116 yaks on a Boeing.
00:25:53,00:25:54,- No.
00:25:54,00:25:55,"- Yeah, not for fun."
00:25:55,00:25:58,"It was for a relocation program, but it was, yeah."
00:25:58,00:26:00,"That was last year, so it feels like it's a beatable record."
00:26:00,00:26:03,Like it feels like it's innovation in the space right now.
00:26:03,00:26:06,- What's the fun version of that number of yaks on a plane?
00:26:06,00:26:09,"- Well, I'm scripting something."
00:26:09,00:26:11,"I don't wanna talk about it, but I..."
00:26:11,00:26:14,- Did they go in the seats?
00:26:14,00:26:15,- Yep.
00:26:15,00:26:17,(audience laughing)
00:26:17,00:26:19,"- Oh, did they go in the hold, I guess?"
00:26:19,00:26:21,- I think they always have to go in crates
00:26:21,00:26:22,and custom-made crates and things.
00:26:22,00:26:25,"When you're moving like Megaforna, you have to,"
00:26:25,00:26:26,you have to do that.
00:26:26,00:26:29,"- Yeah, when you're moving in Megaforna, James."
00:26:29,00:26:30,You have to...
00:26:30,00:26:31,Do you know what?
00:26:31,00:26:32,James is such an idiot.
00:26:32,00:26:32,- I am like that.
00:26:32,00:26:33,(audience laughing)
00:26:33,00:26:36,"- My God, have I ever met a man who knows less"
00:26:36,00:26:37,about moving Megaforna than James?
00:26:37,00:26:38,(audience laughing)
00:26:38,00:26:41,- Can I tell you something just to change the subject
00:26:41,00:26:42,about moving Megaforna?
00:26:42,00:26:44,(audience laughing)
00:26:44,00:26:47,- So there's a company called Cargo Lux.
00:26:47,00:26:49,It's a Luxembourg Guards company.
00:26:49,00:26:52,"And they have the tagline, ""You name it, we fly it."""
00:26:52,00:26:53,And they fly...
00:26:53,00:26:56,"If you need a big animal moving from one place to another,"
00:26:56,00:26:57,these are the guys you go to.
00:26:57,00:26:59,"And a couple of years ago,"
00:26:59,00:27:04,they moved a beluga whale from China to Iceland.
00:27:04,00:27:05,- Okay.
00:27:05,00:27:06,- For fun?
00:27:06,00:27:06,- Or...
00:27:06,00:27:09,(audience laughing)
00:27:09,00:27:13,"- No, it was very serious."
00:27:13,00:27:16,"It was in a sanctuary, like an ocean sanctuary."
00:27:16,00:27:18,They wanted to move it to Iceland
00:27:18,00:27:20,where it could live in the wild.
00:27:20,00:27:22,"And to cut a long story short,"
00:27:22,00:27:24,they just put it in a big hammock
00:27:24,00:27:26,and keep pouring water on it.
00:27:26,00:27:26,"- Yeah, okay."
00:27:26,00:27:30,"- But they did, they kept it in very, very cold water"
00:27:30,00:27:31,for a couple of months beforehand.
00:27:31,00:27:34,So it's blubber would get thicker for the journey because...
00:27:34,00:27:36,- 'Cause it's cold on a plane?
00:27:36,00:27:37,"- Yeah, well, you have to keep your..."
00:27:37,00:27:38,You have to regulate your temperature
00:27:38,00:27:39,and that's how they do it.
00:27:39,00:27:40,- Yeah.
00:27:40,00:27:42,"And I guess it would be moving to colder waters as well,"
00:27:42,00:27:43,if it's going to say...
00:27:43,00:27:44,"- To Iceland, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:27:44,00:27:47,"It's just a thing that happened, but..."
00:27:47,00:27:49,"And when they arrived in Keflavik,"
00:27:49,00:27:52,"the locals gave them a salute of water,"
00:27:52,00:27:55,like they got hose pipes so that the plane could go
00:27:55,00:27:57,"through them, which sounds dangerous."
00:27:57,00:27:59,Especially in Iceland.
00:27:59,00:28:01,"- Yeah, true, yeah."
00:28:01,00:28:03,Just on reintroducing things.
00:28:03,00:28:04,"- Oh, yeah?"
00:28:04,00:28:07,- Would you guys like to see animals introduced to the UK?
00:28:07,00:28:09,Show of cheers.
00:28:09,00:28:11,"- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, which animals?"
00:28:11,00:28:13,And now we come to the meat.
00:28:13,00:28:16,"Okay, so animals that have gone extinct,"
00:28:16,00:28:18,"that used to live in England,"
00:28:18,00:28:19,but have gone out of business here.
00:28:19,00:28:20,- Okay.
00:28:20,00:28:21,- Beavers.
00:28:21,00:28:23,- Beavers!
00:28:23,00:28:24,- That always gets a cheer.
00:28:24,00:28:26,"- I know, and beavers against?"
00:28:26,00:28:29,"- Boo, no beavers."
00:28:29,00:28:31,- Who would like moose back?
00:28:31,00:28:33,- Boo!
00:28:33,00:28:34,- Did we ever have moose?
00:28:34,00:28:35,- We had moose.
00:28:35,00:28:36,- Did we?
00:28:36,00:28:37,"- Yeah, we did."
00:28:37,00:28:42,- So lots of people want beavers and like birds.
00:28:42,00:28:44,37% of people want moose back.
00:28:44,00:28:46,37% want wild boar.
00:28:46,00:28:47,Can I have a cheer for wolves?
00:28:47,00:28:52,I think that's more than beavers or moose.
00:28:52,00:28:54,- That's a lot of people who don't live in houses
00:28:54,00:28:55,made of straw.
00:28:55,00:29:01,"- But 31% of people would be up for wild wolves in the UK,"
00:29:01,00:29:03,which I think I'm up for.
00:29:03,00:29:05,"Okay, what about bears?"
00:29:06,00:29:08,"- And again, these are people who are not living"
00:29:08,00:29:09,with the consequences.
00:29:09,00:29:12,- What about wasps?
00:29:12,00:29:16,- You see?
00:29:16,00:29:18,"You know what I mean, they'd rather have bears than wasps."
00:29:18,00:29:19,"Honestly, I think a bear would ruin your picnic"
00:29:19,00:29:21,"quicker than a wasp would, I think."
00:29:21,00:29:29,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:29:29,00:29:31,and that is James.
00:29:31,00:29:35,"- Okay, my fact this week is that this year at Poundland,"
00:29:35,00:29:39,"if you had one pound, you could buy a tin of Pilchats,"
00:29:39,00:29:44,"a water pistol, or all 825 UK Poundland stores."
00:29:44,00:29:48,"- That's, yeah."
00:29:48,00:29:50,"- So yeah, I mean, you wouldn't be able to go in"
00:29:50,00:29:52,"with your quid and say, can I have them?"
00:29:52,00:29:53,"There has to be some lawyers involved in stuff,"
00:29:53,00:29:57,but the fact is that Poundland was sold this year for one pound.
00:29:57,00:29:59,"- Wow, plus 10p for the bag."
00:29:59,00:30:04,"- And this is the thing,"
00:30:04,00:30:07,"like it's a thing in UK law if you want to buy a company,"
00:30:07,00:30:10,"and let's say they have loads and loads of debts,"
00:30:10,00:30:11,"so they're not really worth very much,"
00:30:11,00:30:13,but you want to buy the brand or whatever.
00:30:13,00:30:15,"In theory, you think you could just pay nothing for that"
00:30:15,00:30:17,"because you know, you're taking on debt,"
00:30:17,00:30:19,"but in that actual fact, you have to swap something"
00:30:19,00:30:21,"between you in order for it to make a contract,"
00:30:21,00:30:24,"and usually when they do that, they do one pound."
00:30:24,00:30:26,And there's been lots of things that have been bought
00:30:26,00:30:28,and sold for one pound.
00:30:28,00:30:30,Ken Bates bought Chelsea Football Club for one pound
00:30:30,00:30:35,"in 1982, and then sold it to Roman Abramovich"
00:30:35,00:30:40,"for £140 million, about 20 years later, so you know."
00:30:40,00:30:42,- That's a good investment.
00:30:42,00:30:43,- She is.
00:30:43,00:30:46,"- Probably could buy half a defender with that, couldn't you?"
00:30:46,00:30:48,"- Portsmouth, Swansea City, Hull City, Bolton Wanderers,"
00:30:48,00:30:50,and Notts County have all been bought
00:30:50,00:30:52,for one pound in their history.
00:30:52,00:30:54,"Notts County, the oldest football team as well."
00:30:54,00:30:57,"- Oh yes, Aston Villa, they were bought for a pound."
00:30:57,00:30:58,- Were they?
00:30:58,00:30:59,"- Yeah, but if you buy a tin of Piltrons,"
00:30:59,00:31:02,no one says that does come with £200 million worth of debt.
00:31:02,00:31:04,"- Exactly, that is the difference."
00:31:04,00:31:08,"So yeah, they were sold by a Polish firm called PEPCO"
00:31:08,00:31:11,to a US investment firm called Gordon Brothers.
00:31:11,00:31:12,- Do you know what's really sad about this?
00:31:12,00:31:17,"Is that I could buy 825 UK Poundland stores with my pound,"
00:31:17,00:31:21,yet I wouldn't be able to buy a single pint of Ruddles
00:31:21,00:31:25,"anymore because of this mad inflation that's gone on,"
00:31:25,00:31:27,this just pisses me off more.
00:31:27,00:31:28,"- That's devastating, yeah."
00:31:28,00:31:30,Poundland is very interesting.
00:31:30,00:31:33,"The idea of setting up a shop where everything was a pound,"
00:31:33,00:31:36,"and it did have to buckle because things did go up,"
00:31:36,00:31:38,"so obviously things were more than a pound,"
00:31:38,00:31:40,but just the very idea of setting up a shop
00:31:40,00:31:42,and going everything as a pound
00:31:42,00:31:43,is a pretty remarkable thing.
00:31:43,00:31:45,"- Yeah, because a lot of things are a pound."
00:31:45,00:31:46,- Right.
00:31:46,00:31:47,- That's the clever thing about it.
00:31:47,00:31:48,- Yeah.
00:31:48,00:31:49,"- You're going, ""Oh my God, everything's a pound."""
00:31:49,00:31:51,"You go, ""Yeah, but I mean, they cost a pound."""
00:31:51,00:31:53,"- Yeah, you're not selling iPads for a pound."
00:31:53,00:31:55,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:31:55,00:31:58,- But Poundland was a bit of a Nepo store
00:31:58,00:32:01,because they were founded with a 50K loan
00:32:01,00:32:03,"from a guy called Stephen Smith's father,"
00:32:03,00:32:06,"who had, he had a cash and carry business,"
00:32:06,00:32:08,and he gave his son a loan so that they could sell
00:32:08,00:32:09,this new company.
00:32:09,00:32:10,- A loan of one pound.
00:32:10,00:32:13,"- But in fairness, the whole family had come"
00:32:13,00:32:16,"from a market stall background,"
00:32:16,00:32:19,and the business idea for Poundland came
00:32:19,00:32:20,"because on their market stall,"
00:32:20,00:32:23,"they had a box where everything was 10p,"
00:32:23,00:32:24,and people would just go in and grab something
00:32:24,00:32:25,and put their 10p in the thing.
00:32:25,00:32:28,They thought we could make this a big thing.
00:32:28,00:32:30,"And actually, I think in the UK,"
00:32:30,00:32:31,"there's quite a lot of companies,"
00:32:31,00:32:35,"especially supermarkets, that began in the markets."
00:32:35,00:32:36,- Yeah.
00:32:36,00:32:36,- Didn't they?
00:32:36,00:32:38,"Tescos, Morrison's and Mark's and Spencer's"
00:32:38,00:32:40,were all originally market stalls.
00:32:40,00:32:41,- Right.
00:32:41,00:32:44,- There's a Poundland Museum as well.
00:32:44,00:32:45,"There's a Poundland Museum,"
00:32:45,00:32:48,"and even better than that, you can buy it if you want."
00:32:48,00:32:50,You can buy it for 4.25 million.
00:32:50,00:32:54,"So Keith Smith, who set up Poundland with his son,"
00:32:54,00:32:56,he went off to the Algarve after Steve Smith
00:32:56,00:32:57,"was building this thing,"
00:32:57,00:32:59,and he and his wife came back to England
00:32:59,00:33:00,and bought a house.
00:33:00,00:33:01,I've got the name of it.
00:33:01,00:33:01,- Lutstone Hall.
00:33:01,00:33:04,"- Lutstone Hall, and in Lutstone Hall,"
00:33:04,00:33:07,it has the Poundland Museum in one of the barns there.
00:33:07,00:33:10,And it's on the right move right now.
00:33:10,00:33:12,"If you look at Cleverley in Shropshire,"
00:33:12,00:33:15,you can take a look at Lutstone Hall.
00:33:15,00:33:17,There isn't actually a shot of the Poundland Museum.
00:33:17,00:33:19,- But I feel like they're tricking the buyer
00:33:19,00:33:21,"because it's not only a Poundland Museum,"
00:33:21,00:33:23,it's also a Lutstone Hall Museum.
00:33:23,00:33:25,So you've got all these amazing bits of archeology
00:33:25,00:33:26,"that they've dug up,"
00:33:26,00:33:29,"sitting next to Poundland items, right?"
00:33:29,00:33:31,"But they say you get the house,"
00:33:31,00:33:32,"which is unbelievably beautiful,"
00:33:32,00:33:34,but they're gonna take all of the stuff
00:33:34,00:33:36,in the Poundland Museum and bring it to headquarters.
00:33:36,00:33:39,So you actually don't get the Poundland Museum.
00:33:39,00:33:42,"- I bet if I've made them an offer,"
00:33:42,00:33:44,"and I'd said I'm buying it,"
00:33:44,00:33:45,"but I want the Poundland Museum,"
00:33:45,00:33:46,"they go, ""Yeah, fine."""
00:33:46,00:33:47,Because it's still for sale.
00:33:47,00:33:48,It's been selling for a long time.
00:33:48,00:33:50,"- Yeah, they've had to halve the price."
00:33:50,00:33:52,"- So if I'm saying to them, full asking price."
00:33:52,00:33:53,"- Is it you and me on Zoopla,"
00:33:53,00:33:55,just constantly looking at this house?
00:33:55,00:33:57,"- One other person interested, it says."
00:33:57,00:34:00,"- It started at about 9.5 million, right?"
00:34:00,00:34:02,Then it was down to 7.75.
00:34:02,00:34:03,Not that I'm obsessed with white move.
00:34:03,00:34:05,"Now, as you say, it's about 4.5 million,"
00:34:05,00:34:07,and it's a really nice house.
00:34:07,00:34:08,It's got one of those swimming pools
00:34:08,00:34:11,where you can put a dance floor over the top of it.
00:34:11,00:34:12,"- And they actually, they reduced the price"
00:34:12,00:34:14,"over a Christmas period for a while,"
00:34:14,00:34:15,thinking that that would be.
00:34:15,00:34:16,"- What is going on, Dad?"
00:34:16,00:34:17,(audience laughing)
00:34:17,00:34:19,- I didn't know you were so into this.
00:34:19,00:34:22,"But if you said I want all the pound land stuff,"
00:34:22,00:34:24,they're not gonna say no.
00:34:24,00:34:26,It's really important to us that that goes to our head office.
00:34:26,00:34:28,"- Listen, if you wanna go halves, I am."
00:34:28,00:34:29,(audience laughing)
00:34:29,00:34:30,"- Yeah, right."
00:34:30,00:34:35,"- If you wanna go, let's readdress that balance."
00:34:35,00:34:36,"- Yeah, let's do it."
00:34:36,00:34:40,"- Richard, would you give a TV show"
00:34:40,00:34:41,to the concept of Poundland?
00:34:41,00:34:43,Would you think that's a good TV show?
00:34:43,00:34:45,- Would you think that's a good TV show to make?
00:34:45,00:34:46,"- Sorry, what are you talking about?"
00:34:46,00:34:48,(audience laughing)
00:34:48,00:34:50,"I've got a format called PoundShop Wars,"
00:34:50,00:34:51,which is all about rivalry
00:34:51,00:34:54,between different kinds of PoundShop.
00:34:54,00:34:55,"- Okay, that's different to what you said."
00:34:55,00:34:58,"When you walked, when you walked in the room,"
00:34:58,00:34:59,"which was, would you like a game show?"
00:34:59,00:35:00,And it's about Poundland.
00:35:00,00:35:01,(laughing)
00:35:01,00:35:03,"- Sorry, because there was a real TV show"
00:35:03,00:35:04,called PoundShop Wars.
00:35:04,00:35:05,- Wow. - Okay.
00:35:05,00:35:07,- And it sounds quite fun.
00:35:07,00:35:10,So I'm just gonna give you a few episode pictures
00:35:10,00:35:11,"and see what you think of it, Richard."
00:35:11,00:35:13,- So someone's already made this.
00:35:13,00:35:13,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:35:13,00:35:15,"- So I might not buy it from you, but go on."
00:35:15,00:35:16,(audience laughing)
00:35:16,00:35:18,"- When Poundland reduces its prices,"
00:35:18,00:35:22,Pound World retaliates by launching the one-pound bra.
00:35:22,00:35:24,(audience laughing)
00:35:24,00:35:26,- Is that a weight thing or a price thing?
00:35:26,00:35:27,"- It's a weight, a price."
00:35:27,00:35:29,(audience laughing)
00:35:29,00:35:31,- Rival stores compete for the crown
00:35:31,00:35:35,of best Halloween PoundShop in South Wales.
00:35:35,00:35:36,"- No, I genuinely would like, I would watch that."
00:35:36,00:35:37,- Okay. - If I watched
00:35:37,00:35:38,"the first two minutes of that,"
00:35:38,00:35:40,"it was on channel five, I think I even saw it."
00:35:40,00:35:41,"- Oh, I'm not sure."
00:35:41,00:35:43,- Almost certainly with John Thompson doing the voiceover.
00:35:43,00:35:45,- Okay.
00:35:45,00:35:46,- It does sound good.
00:35:46,00:35:49,- Did they have any stuff about the 99p stores?
00:35:49,00:35:50,"- No, absolutely not."
00:35:50,00:35:51,"- No, really?"
00:35:51,00:35:52,"- No, that's good."
00:35:52,00:35:53,- I love it.
00:35:53,00:35:55,It tells you everything you ever need to know about economics.
00:35:55,00:35:56,You do not need to go to university.
00:35:56,00:35:59,You need to know that whenever a 99p store
00:35:59,00:36:01,"opens next to a pound store,"
00:36:01,00:36:02,"it takes a lot of their business, right?"
00:36:02,00:36:03,- Yeah.
00:36:03,00:36:06,- Poundland even bought the 99p stores
00:36:06,00:36:10,for 55 million pounds in 2015.
00:36:10,00:36:13,"But then there was also when the 99p stores came out,"
00:36:13,00:36:17,then you started getting 97p stores.
00:36:17,00:36:20,"And in Barking in Essex, there was the 99p store."
00:36:20,00:36:23,"And then on the same street opened a 97p store,"
00:36:23,00:36:26,which had an introductory 95p sale.
00:36:26,00:36:30,- That's good.
00:36:30,00:36:31,- That's really good.
00:36:31,00:36:32,- Economics 101.
00:36:32,00:36:33,"- Do you know who was the father,"
00:36:33,00:36:35,kind of the father of all of this stuff?
00:36:35,00:36:39,So this is a guy called Frank Woolworth of Woolworth.
00:36:39,00:36:41,"So he was the father of discount stores, basically."
00:36:41,00:36:42,- Where was he from?
00:36:42,00:36:43,'Cause you get that in multiple countries now.
00:36:43,00:36:45,"- Yes, he was American."
00:36:45,00:36:47,Woolworth was a big brand in Britain as well
00:36:47,00:36:49,"till it went bust, but he grew up in the States."
00:36:49,00:36:53,And there were already some budget stores in big cities.
00:36:53,00:36:54,And they were called Nickel and Dimes
00:36:54,00:36:57,'cause everything was either a nickel or a dime.
00:36:57,00:36:58,And he opened a thing called Woolworth's
00:36:58,00:37:02,great five cent store in Pennsylvania.
00:37:02,00:37:04,And it became unbelievably successful.
00:37:04,00:37:06,As in he had about a thousand branches.
00:37:06,00:37:07,"No more, probably a couple of thousand"
00:37:07,00:37:10,"all across the States, went international."
00:37:10,00:37:13,And he took the opportunity to go absolutely bananas
00:37:13,00:37:14,with the money.
00:37:14,00:37:18,So he paid for the biggest building in New York to be built.
00:37:18,00:37:20,The tallest building in the world at that time
00:37:20,00:37:23,was the Woolworth building in New York.
00:37:23,00:37:24,And he paid cash for it.
00:37:24,00:37:27,He didn't muck around with mortgages or anything.
00:37:27,00:37:29,"He just said, ""I'm building, I'm commissioning this."""
00:37:29,00:37:32,And then he became obsessed with Napoleon Bonaparte.
00:37:32,00:37:34,That was his thing.
00:37:34,00:37:38,"So his private office, sort of 50 floors up here,"
00:37:38,00:37:41,was an exact replica of Napoleon's private office
00:37:41,00:37:43,from his castle in France.
00:37:43,00:37:44,He would walk around his private estate
00:37:44,00:37:46,"in an old Napoleon uniform,"
00:37:46,00:37:49,like a legitimate old Napoleon uniform.
00:37:49,00:37:51,The gate of the estate is based on the Arc de Triomphe.
00:37:51,00:37:53,He bought Napoleon's old bed.
00:37:53,00:37:56,There was an old slave bed that Napoleon had had.
00:37:56,00:37:58,And there are rumors that he believed he was Napoleon.
00:37:58,00:37:59,- Okay.
00:37:59,00:38:00,- Towards the end.
00:38:00,00:38:01,- And you were saying he wasn't?
00:38:01,00:38:03,- I'm saying he--
00:38:03,00:38:04,- What evidence do you have that he wasn't?
00:38:04,00:38:05,Just out of interest.
00:38:05,00:38:06,- Do you know what?
00:38:06,00:38:08,He was also interested in time travel.
00:38:08,00:38:10,So that's a very good choice.
00:38:10,00:38:13,- He's here today.
00:38:13,00:38:14,- That's amazing.
00:38:14,00:38:17,"- Frank Woolworth, just one of the most eccentric,"
00:38:17,00:38:19,"effectively pound-trop owners, you know."
00:38:19,00:38:21,- Do you know what is the biggest supermarket?
00:38:21,00:38:26,"Fastest growing, let's say, grocery chain in the US today."
00:38:26,00:38:27,It's one you've heard of.
00:38:27,00:38:29,"- Target, is that one in America?"
00:38:29,00:38:30,- It's not Target.
00:38:30,00:38:31,It's one that's bigger in the UK.
00:38:31,00:38:33,"And Europe, I should say."
00:38:33,00:38:34,- Lidl.
00:38:34,00:38:35,- Lidl's very close.
00:38:35,00:38:37,- Aldi. - Aldi is correct.
00:38:37,00:38:39,And so they're starting to learn
00:38:39,00:38:40,about the Isle of Shame now.
00:38:40,00:38:42,"- Oh, sorry."
00:38:42,00:38:44,I thought that was Britain.
00:38:44,00:38:47,(audience laughing)
00:38:47,00:38:53,"- For anyone who doesn't know the Isle of Shame,"
00:38:53,00:38:55,this is the middle Isle of Aldi
00:38:55,00:38:58,where they just put some absolutely crazy things in there.
00:38:58,00:39:01,"Basically, they do something called Overstock"
00:39:01,00:39:04,where if a company has a lot of ironing boards
00:39:04,00:39:05,"that they're trying to get rid of,"
00:39:05,00:39:08,then Aldi will buy them all for really cheap
00:39:08,00:39:10,and then sell them in their shops.
00:39:10,00:39:12,So America is starting to find this.
00:39:12,00:39:13,"And so if you go on the internet,"
00:39:13,00:39:14,you get lots of people asking
00:39:14,00:39:18,what's the weirdest thing you've ever found in the Isle of Shame.
00:39:18,00:39:20,"So things include bucket hats for dogs,"
00:39:20,00:39:25,a light for the inside of your toilet bowl.
00:39:25,00:39:27,"- Okay, hang on."
00:39:27,00:39:28,Let's pause on that.
00:39:28,00:39:29,- Okay.
00:39:29,00:39:30,- Yeah.
00:39:30,00:39:31,- So what's going on there?
00:39:31,00:39:32,"- I would give you 400,000 pound"
00:39:32,00:39:34,for 20% of this company.
00:39:34,00:39:37,(audience laughing)
00:39:37,00:39:39,- If you want to go to the toilet in the night.
00:39:39,00:39:40,- I think that's a brilliant idea.
00:39:40,00:39:42,- You might need something to aim at.
00:39:42,00:39:43,- What runway lights?
00:39:43,00:39:44,- In an airplane.
00:39:44,00:39:45,- Exactly.
00:39:45,00:39:46,- You know the airports didn't used to have those.
00:39:46,00:39:47,- Then I can get rid of the guy
00:39:47,00:39:50,with the ping pong bats in my toilet.
00:39:50,00:39:51,- But hang on.
00:39:51,00:39:53,You don't want to turn on your main bathroom light?
00:39:53,00:39:55,- What if the main bathroom is right next to the bedroom
00:39:55,00:39:58,and you don't want to wake up with your partner or whatever?
00:39:58,00:39:59,- That isn't you don't have a door.
00:39:59,00:40:01,(audience laughing)
00:40:01,00:40:03,"- Sorry, we don't have doors there, all right?"
00:40:03,00:40:05,"- If you get up to go to the toilet in the night,"
00:40:05,00:40:06,do you turn all the lights on?
00:40:06,00:40:09,- I just feel my way to the bathroom.
00:40:09,00:40:10,- That's really selfish if you do that.
00:40:10,00:40:11,"- Hang on, no, I'm sorry."
00:40:11,00:40:13,(audience laughing)
00:40:13,00:40:14,I don't turn on the main light.
00:40:14,00:40:15,"- I bet you flush as well, don't you?"
00:40:15,00:40:16,- I do.
00:40:16,00:40:17,(audience laughing)
00:40:17,00:40:18,"What I do is I get out of bed,"
00:40:18,00:40:21,"I go right up to my wife's ear and I go,"
00:40:21,00:40:22,"""Where's the toilet again?"""
00:40:22,00:40:24,(audience laughing)
00:40:24,00:40:27,"Hey, you would go into the toilet, it's a separate room."
00:40:27,00:40:27,You turn the light on.
00:40:27,00:40:28,"- I'm so sorry, what on earth are you using"
00:40:28,00:40:30,your iPhone light for?
00:40:30,00:40:32,- That's very personal a question.
00:40:32,00:40:33,(audience laughing)
00:40:33,00:40:35,- You don't turn the light on at night.
00:40:35,00:40:38,"- You guys are nuts, what are you talking about?"
00:40:38,00:40:41,It's in a different room altogether.
00:40:41,00:40:43,"- Oh, well, someone's doing your life for himself."
00:40:43,00:40:44,"- Oh, but to me."
00:40:44,00:40:49,"- Ew, I'm just going to the West Wing to have a wee."
00:40:49,00:40:51,"Fuck it, ow."
00:40:51,00:40:52,- Some of us are still on
00:40:52,00:40:55,the old trusty ceramic bowl under the bed.
00:40:55,00:40:58,(audience laughing)
00:40:58,00:41:00,- It's honestly like sitting next to Prince Andrew.
00:41:00,00:41:04,(audience laughing)
00:41:04,00:41:05,"- All right, what else is there?"
00:41:05,00:41:06,- What else is there?
00:41:06,00:41:06,"- So that's a good, that's a good,"
00:41:06,00:41:08,I think that's not an insane idea.
00:41:08,00:41:10,"- None of these, like people bought these things."
00:41:10,00:41:12,"Dessert, hummus."
00:41:12,00:41:12,"- Dessert, hummus."
00:41:12,00:41:14,"- Dessert, hummus."
00:41:14,00:41:15,"It's made of chickpeas, but it's sweet."
00:41:15,00:41:16,"- Oh, okay."
00:41:16,00:41:17,Are the red tights get pissed off
00:41:17,00:41:20,when they taste the difference?
00:41:20,00:41:22,"- And then one person on Reddit,"
00:41:22,00:41:23,when they asked what's the weirdest thing
00:41:23,00:41:25,"you found in the Isle of Shame said,"
00:41:25,00:41:28,"""I work at Aldi, so my take is a bit different"
00:41:28,00:41:29,"""than the shopper, but the weirdest thing"
00:41:29,00:41:31,"""I have found in the Isle of Shame"
00:41:31,00:41:33,"""is a turd lying on the ground."""
00:41:33,00:41:37,(audience laughing)
00:41:37,00:41:37,- And that's what happens
00:41:37,00:41:40,"when you don't turn the lights on, so take it back."
00:41:40,00:41:44,(upbeat music)
00:41:44,00:41:50,"- It is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:41:50,00:41:51,and that is my fact.
00:41:51,00:41:54,My fact this week is that not long
00:41:54,00:41:57,"after he released his song ""All By Myself"","
00:41:57,00:42:00,the musician Eric Carman was taken to court
00:42:00,00:42:02,"because as it turned out,"
00:42:02,00:42:05,"he did not write it ""All By Myself""."
00:42:05,00:42:08,"We all know the song, it was in Bridget Jones' diary."
00:42:08,00:42:11,"Celine Dion covered it, it's a massive tune,"
00:42:11,00:42:13,"and Eric Carman put it on his debut album,"
00:42:13,00:42:15,and he decided to incorporate
00:42:15,00:42:18,"the second movement of a piece by Rachmaninov,"
00:42:18,00:42:20,"and he thought, because in America,"
00:42:20,00:42:21,"it was out of copyright,"
00:42:21,00:42:24,"that that would be the case globally, but it wasn't,"
00:42:24,00:42:27,and so he had to give over 12%
00:42:27,00:42:29,"of the royalties forever on,"
00:42:29,00:42:33,"and so Rachmaninov has a co-write credit on ""All By Myself""."
00:42:33,00:42:34,- Crazy.
00:42:34,00:42:37,"I mean, it is in fairness, it is identical, isn't it?"
00:42:37,00:42:39,"- Yeah, and he wasn't trying to steal it,"
00:42:39,00:42:40,"it wasn't a plagiarism thing,"
00:42:40,00:42:42,he thought it was out of copyright.
00:42:42,00:42:45,"- Yeah, he was a massive Rachmaninov fan, I think,"
00:42:45,00:42:47,"and when they asked him about it, he said,"
00:42:47,00:42:49,"""I thought it's a crime that there are some spectacular"
00:42:49,00:42:51,melodies in classical music
00:42:51,00:42:54,"that the general public doesn't get exposed to."""
00:42:54,00:42:57,But it turned out that the actual crime was plagiarism.
00:42:57,00:43:00,(audience laughing)
00:43:00,00:43:03,"- The irony of the title, that ""All By Myself"","
00:43:03,00:43:05,"and he didn't write it all by himself,"
00:43:05,00:43:10,reminds me of the absolute classic case of Gary Portnoy.
00:43:10,00:43:12,"- I grew up with him, yes."
00:43:12,00:43:13,Who's that?
00:43:13,00:43:14,- I know the name.
00:43:14,00:43:15,- You know Gary Portnoy?
00:43:15,00:43:16,You know Gary Portnoy?
00:43:16,00:43:19,"He's the man who wrote ""When Everybody Knows Your Name""."
00:43:19,00:43:22,"- Oh, cheers. - The theme tune to ""Cheers""."
00:43:22,00:43:25,"Yeah, which one of the most famous songs in our culture,"
00:43:25,00:43:26,but no one knows who wrote it was Gary Portnoy.
00:43:26,00:43:28,"- Yes, that's great."
00:43:28,00:43:29,- There you go.
00:43:29,00:43:29,- That's really good.
00:43:29,00:43:31,- James didn't know his name.
00:43:31,00:43:33,- I've heard the name before because I've watched every episode
00:43:33,00:43:35,"about 20 times and it comes up, doesn't it?"
00:43:35,00:43:36,- Gary Portnoy.
00:43:36,00:43:38,"- Does this work when you're on quizzes,"
00:43:38,00:43:39,"if you just say, ""Oh, I did know it""?"
00:43:39,00:43:40,(audience laughing)
00:43:40,00:43:42,"- Yeah, if you're honest."
00:43:42,00:43:45,"- Yeah, there should be benefit of the doubt points"
00:43:45,00:43:46,at the end of every round.
00:43:46,00:43:47,"- Oh, I was gonna say that."
00:43:47,00:43:48,"Well, if you were gonna say it,"
00:43:48,00:43:49,then I'm gonna give you the points.
00:43:49,00:43:51,(audience laughing)
00:43:51,00:43:52,"- I'm taking notes for ""What's My Spoon"","
00:43:52,00:43:53,don't worry guys.
00:43:53,00:43:54,(audience laughing)
00:43:54,00:43:56,So this is a really big thing in lots of songs.
00:43:56,00:43:58,There are songwriters who will get sued later on
00:43:58,00:44:01,because some similarity has been found.
00:44:01,00:44:04,So one of the most famous recent cases of that
00:44:04,00:44:07,"was the song ""Blurred Lines"", if anyone remembers that."
00:44:07,00:44:08,- Friend of the podcast.
00:44:08,00:44:10,"- Right, T.I. for over Williams and--"
00:44:10,00:44:11,- Robin Thickey.
00:44:11,00:44:12,- Robin Thickey.
00:44:12,00:44:13,(audience laughing)
00:44:13,00:44:14,They had to pay.
00:44:14,00:44:16,(audience laughing)
00:44:16,00:44:19,"They had to pay $5 million of the proceeds of ""Blurred Lines"","
00:44:19,00:44:22,"which I mean, I'm naive about how much"
00:44:22,00:44:24,"an individual hit earns you, clearly."
00:44:24,00:44:27,They had to pay $5 million to Marvin Gaye's estate.
00:44:27,00:44:31,"Not because of a particular melody or anything,"
00:44:31,00:44:34,it was because of basically the feel of the song.
00:44:34,00:44:35,- The vibe.
00:44:35,00:44:36,- The vibe.
00:44:36,00:44:37,Like they had borrowed the vibe.
00:44:37,00:44:39,"- To be fair, when you listen to it,"
00:44:39,00:44:41,"you can kind of see where they're coming from,"
00:44:41,00:44:43,'cause it's like a kind of funky bass
00:44:43,00:44:44,and some cowbells and--
00:44:44,00:44:47,"- Yeah, but I mean, that feels really harsh."
00:44:47,00:44:47,- I know.
00:44:47,00:44:49,- 'Cause they were going for a kind of old school funky hit.
00:44:49,00:44:53,"- I think that one did feel like, that's an odd one."
00:44:53,00:44:56,'Cause there's very obvious ones where absolutely is the case.
00:44:56,00:44:57,- Completely.
00:44:57,00:44:58,"- There was one that I read about, which was,"
00:44:58,00:44:59,"I don't know if you all remember,"
00:44:59,00:45:01,but Louise Redknapp had a song a long time ago
00:45:01,00:45:03,"called ""Naked""."
00:45:03,00:45:06,"The lyrics are, I could feel your eyes all over my body,"
00:45:06,00:45:08,"I can read the signs, they're sexual,"
00:45:08,00:45:10,"I can read your mind, I can see you want me."
00:45:10,00:45:13,"And basically, someone effectively ripped"
00:45:13,00:45:18,"the entire melody and the bounce of the tempo of the song,"
00:45:18,00:45:20,"and they sued them, and so the co-writers of ""Naked"""
00:45:20,00:45:22,by Louise Redknapp are now the co-writers
00:45:22,00:45:25,"of ""Pepper's Party Time"" from ""Pepper Pig"","
00:45:25,00:45:28,who sang a song about jumping in muddy puddles.
00:45:28,00:45:30,"- Yeah, and again, it does sound,"
00:45:30,00:45:31,"if you listen to the both, it is-"
00:45:31,00:45:34,"- It's pretty much for much, lyrically as well, yeah."
00:45:34,00:45:36,(audience laughing)
00:45:36,00:45:38,"- I was listening to one, ""Viva La Vida"" by Coldplay,"
00:45:38,00:45:41,"which I love, that's a Roman cavalry choirs"
00:45:41,00:45:42,are singing all that kind of stuff.
00:45:42,00:45:44,"There's a song by Joe Sattriani called ""If I Could Fly"","
00:45:44,00:45:45,"and I was listening to the first minute of that,"
00:45:45,00:45:47,"I thought, ""This is nothing like it."""
00:45:47,00:45:48,"And then it gets to a bit,"
00:45:48,00:45:50,"you go, ""Oh, that is exactly like that song."""
00:45:50,00:45:51,"So, but that's called ""If I Could Fly"","
00:45:51,00:45:53,"and I do a very brief sidebar,"
00:45:53,00:45:55,"because instead of putting in ""If I Could Fly"","
00:45:55,00:45:56,"I put in ""I Wish I Could Fly"","
00:45:56,00:45:59,"which is the Keith Harris and Orville song,"
00:45:59,00:46:00,"if anyone remembers that,"
00:46:00,00:46:02,"which is ""I Wish I Could Fly"" right up to the sky,"
00:46:02,00:46:04,"but I can't, Keith says, ""You can."""
00:46:04,00:46:05,"It's called Orville's song,"
00:46:05,00:46:07,and so I Googled Orville's song.
00:46:07,00:46:09,"I originally wrote Orville's dong,"
00:46:09,00:46:10,"but,"
00:46:10,00:46:13,(audience laughing)
00:46:13,00:46:15,"fortunately, it said, ""Do you mean Orville's song?"""
00:46:15,00:46:18,"But, so, a lot of people know,"
00:46:18,00:46:20,a lot of people know the first verse of Orville's song.
00:46:20,00:46:22,"The second verse, I think,"
00:46:22,00:46:24,might be the bleakest thing
00:46:24,00:46:27,"ever written in any medium, ever."
00:46:27,00:46:29,"So, the first verse is, you know,"
00:46:29,00:46:30,"you have sort of a roughy no ear going,"
00:46:30,00:46:32,"""I wish I could fly right up to the sky,"
00:46:32,00:46:36,"""but I can't, Keith, you can, Orville, I can't."
00:46:36,00:46:38,"""I wish I could see what folks see in me,"
00:46:38,00:46:43,"""but I can't, Keith, you can, Orville, I can't."""
00:46:43,00:46:45,Second verse.
00:46:45,00:46:49,"So, Orville, ""I wish that I had a mom and a dad,"
00:46:49,00:46:51,"""but I don't."
00:46:51,00:46:54,"""Keith, you don't, Orville, I don't."""
00:46:54,00:46:56,(audience laughing)
00:46:56,00:46:57,And here we go.
00:46:57,00:47:00,Back to Orville.
00:47:00,00:47:04,"""I'd like to pretend my sadness will end,"
00:47:04,00:47:05,"""but it won't."
00:47:05,00:47:06,(audience laughing)
00:47:06,00:47:10,"""Keith, it will, Orville, it won't."""
00:47:10,00:47:13,(audience laughing)
00:47:13,00:47:14,And that was number four.
00:47:14,00:47:16,"That got to, that was like a big hit."
00:47:16,00:47:17,- Wow.
00:47:17,00:47:19,"- I mean, that's quite something, isn't it?"
00:47:19,00:47:20,- It's quite something.
00:47:20,00:47:23,"- Yeah, ""I'd like to pretend that my sadness will end."""
00:47:23,00:47:25,"I mean, that's like Iris Murdoch."
00:47:25,00:47:26,- Good Lord.
00:47:26,00:47:28,- They're the only people who've ever been allowed
00:47:28,00:47:30,"to confer on Pointless Celebrities,"
00:47:30,00:47:31,Keith Harris and Orville.
00:47:31,00:47:32,(audience laughing)
00:47:32,00:47:33,Very nice.
00:47:33,00:47:34,"They came on together, we were like,"
00:47:34,00:47:35,"""Yeah, but this is fine."""
00:47:35,00:47:36,(audience laughing)
00:47:36,00:47:38,None of us saw a problem with that.
00:47:38,00:47:39,(audience laughing)
00:47:39,00:47:40,- How did they do?
00:47:40,00:47:41,"- They did great, actually,"
00:47:41,00:47:43,"'cause they were up against Tommy Cannon and Bobby Ball,"
00:47:43,00:47:46,who scored 600 points in the first round.
00:47:46,00:47:47,- Wow.
00:47:47,00:47:48,- Which to this day is a Pointless Celebrities record.
00:47:48,00:47:49,- Wow.
00:47:49,00:47:51,- Taylor Swift.
00:47:51,00:47:52,"- Oh, yeah."
00:47:52,00:47:53,- Singer.
00:47:53,00:47:56,"So she has a song called ""Look What You Made Me Do,"""
00:47:56,00:47:57,which is a great song.
00:47:57,00:47:59,"It's an absolute banger,"
00:47:59,00:48:01,"but it has a single cadence,"
00:48:01,00:48:04,which was pretty much the same as one used in
00:48:04,00:48:06,"Wright said, ""Friends, I'm too sexy."""
00:48:06,00:48:07,- Ah.
00:48:07,00:48:09,- Which was a really bad hit.
00:48:09,00:48:10,"Like it was great, but it was sexy."
00:48:10,00:48:11,- I'm too sexy.
00:48:11,00:48:12,"- Come on, mate."
00:48:12,00:48:14,"- Okay, all right."
00:48:14,00:48:15,"- I mean, it's no deeply dippy,"
00:48:15,00:48:16,but it's not bad.
00:48:16,00:48:18,(audience laughing)
00:48:18,00:48:20,"But basically, the writers of Wright said Fred,"
00:48:20,00:48:22,"or Wright said Fred themselves, I suppose,"
00:48:22,00:48:24,"have now got a credit on ""Look What You Made Me Do,"""
00:48:24,00:48:25,'cause their cadence ended up in it.
00:48:25,00:48:27,And this is a really common thing.
00:48:27,00:48:29,"Like if a big star has a hit coming up,"
00:48:29,00:48:31,"or a song coming up for release,"
00:48:31,00:48:33,"like they'll have people check over it and they'll say,"
00:48:33,00:48:35,"""It's quite similar to this existing thing."
00:48:35,00:48:37,"""Do you want to change a few notes?"""
00:48:37,00:48:40,"So people actively make the songs arguably worse,"
00:48:40,00:48:42,"'cause they'll say, ""I'll just change these songs"
00:48:42,00:48:43,"""so it's not like, I don't know,"
00:48:43,00:48:45,"""yesterday,"" or whatever it is, you know."
00:48:45,00:48:47,- 'Cause there's only so many notes.
00:48:47,00:48:48,- I feel like it's all fine.
00:48:48,00:48:50,I feel like it's all fine to do.
00:48:50,00:48:51,- Do you?
00:48:51,00:48:51,- A lot of them.
00:48:51,00:48:52,"- Thank you, your honor."
00:48:52,00:48:53,(audience laughing)
00:48:53,00:48:55,"- No, but it's an interesting point because"
00:48:55,00:48:57,the line that often gets said
00:48:57,00:49:00,"from the old generation of rock stars, John Lennon period,"
00:49:00,00:49:01,"they would say, ""Steal from the best,"""
00:49:01,00:49:03,"and they did sometimes get busted,"
00:49:03,00:49:04,but if you look at the modern--
00:49:04,00:49:05,- And busted are the best.
00:49:05,00:49:06,- Yeah.
00:49:06,00:49:07,(audience laughing)
00:49:07,00:49:09,"And the modern crop, you've got Olivia Rodrigo,"
00:49:09,00:49:12,who was sued multiple times for her debut album
00:49:12,00:49:16,"by various people, but the old crop, Elvis Costello,"
00:49:16,00:49:18,"said, ""No, go for it, this is great."""
00:49:18,00:49:20,"The strokes with their biggest hits,"
00:49:20,00:49:22,"that was a Tom Petty song,"
00:49:22,00:49:23,almost literally ripped--
00:49:23,00:49:25,- Last night by the strokes.
00:49:25,00:49:27,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:49:27,00:49:28,"Did Petty, I don't think he ended up--"
00:49:28,00:49:29,"- I think he was called,"
00:49:29,00:49:31,I think they came to an arrangement.
00:49:31,00:49:32,"- Oh, okay."
00:49:32,00:49:33,- He was quite called about it.
00:49:33,00:49:34,- Yeah.
00:49:34,00:49:35,"- So he wasn't, that's nice, he wasn't Petty."
00:49:35,00:49:36,"Sorry, just to, like--"
00:49:36,00:49:37,(audience laughing)
00:49:37,00:49:41,"- Phil Manzanero, who was in Roxy Music,"
00:49:41,00:49:43,"every now and again, like he'd be sent a royalty check"
00:49:43,00:49:45,"for like 1.5 million pound,"
00:49:45,00:49:46,"and every time you'd have to go,"
00:49:46,00:49:48,"""Sorry, this is Ray Manzorak from The Doors."""
00:49:48,00:49:50,"This happens every now and again, so he sends it back,"
00:49:50,00:49:53,"then he gets a royalty check for 1.5 million dollars,"
00:49:53,00:49:55,"goes, ""Sorry, this is Ray Manzorak."""
00:49:55,00:49:57,"They said, ""Oh no, someone took a riff"
00:49:57,00:49:58,"""you did from a 1970s album,"
00:49:58,00:50:01,"""and it's on the new Kanye and Jay-Z album."""
00:50:01,00:50:03,"And so it was his money,"
00:50:03,00:50:05,"and he had just one of their kind of scouts,"
00:50:05,00:50:07,"found an old record, thought this is an amazing riff,"
00:50:07,00:50:09,"found out who'd done it, sent him the money."
00:50:09,00:50:10,- Wow.
00:50:10,00:50:12,"- Yeah, it's worth having, isn't it?"
00:50:12,00:50:13,"- Yeah, that's great."
00:50:13,00:50:17,"I found a really weird moment in pop history,"
00:50:17,00:50:20,"so Blame It On The Boogie was written by Michael Jackson,"
00:50:20,00:50:22,"a very different Michael Jackson,"
00:50:22,00:50:24,"who was also a singer,"
00:50:24,00:50:26,"who would trade under the name Mick Jackson,"
00:50:26,00:50:29,"but then it got taken to America via his people,"
00:50:29,00:50:31,and it was played to a bunch of different people.
00:50:31,00:50:34,One of the people who heard it was the Jackson Five.
00:50:34,00:50:36,"They recorded their own version,"
00:50:36,00:50:37,and they released it in America.
00:50:37,00:50:39,"Meanwhile, Mick Jackson is getting to release"
00:50:39,00:50:41,"his own version in England,"
00:50:41,00:50:45,"and no one knows who is who, because it's the same name."
00:50:45,00:50:49,"BBC Radio One would only play the Jackson Five version,"
00:50:49,00:50:52,"whereas Capitol Radio would only play the Mick Jackson version,"
00:50:52,00:50:54,"and they were battling it out in the charts,"
00:50:54,00:50:56,with people being confused about who is who.
00:50:56,00:50:57,- That's cool.
00:50:57,00:50:59,"- It's just the most random name connection, yeah,"
00:50:59,00:51:00,"that you could get,"
00:51:00,00:51:02,and he so happened to be an artist in his own right.
00:51:02,00:51:03,- Very cool.
00:51:03,00:51:05,All my stuff's about Rachmaninoff.
00:51:05,00:51:08,"- Oh, let's hear about Rachmaninoff."
00:51:08,00:51:09,- He...
00:51:09,00:51:10,- Who did he rip off?
00:51:10,00:51:11,Doido.
00:51:11,00:51:13,(laughing)
00:51:13,00:51:18,"- His first symphony, he played it to Rimsky-Korsakov."
00:51:18,00:51:20,"He, like, went to the rehearsals,"
00:51:20,00:51:22,"and Rimsky-Korsakov said this,"
00:51:22,00:51:26,"""I do not find this music at all agreeable."""
00:51:26,00:51:28,"I was gonna translate it, this is shit,"
00:51:28,00:51:30,but it was basically that's what he said.
00:51:30,00:51:31,"Rachmaninoff suddenly thought,"
00:51:31,00:51:33,"oh my God, this isn't very good,"
00:51:33,00:51:35,"but he couldn't call it off,"
00:51:35,00:51:36,so he spent the whole of the first symphony
00:51:36,00:51:39,hiding in a staircase backstage.
00:51:39,00:51:40,"- Yeah, but then, like--"
00:51:40,00:51:41,- Was it a success?
00:51:41,00:51:43,"- Oh no, no, no, no, no, no."
00:51:43,00:51:44,It happened once.
00:51:44,00:51:46,"The one reviewer wrote that,"
00:51:46,00:51:48,"""If the devil had written a symphony"
00:51:48,00:51:50,"""based on the 10 plagues of Egypt,"
00:51:50,00:51:52,"""and it was like Mr. Rachmaninoff's,"
00:51:52,00:51:54,"""then he would have fulfilled his task brilliantly"
00:51:54,00:51:57,"""and would delight the inhabitants of hell."""
00:51:57,00:52:00,Three stars.
00:52:00,00:52:01,(laughing)
00:52:01,00:52:03,And Rachmaninoff refused to let anyone
00:52:03,00:52:05,"perform it again in his lifetime,"
00:52:05,00:52:06,"and when he left Rush,"
00:52:06,00:52:08,"'cause he fled Rush and went to America afterwards,"
00:52:08,00:52:11,"and when he did that, he left his manuscript behind."
00:52:11,00:52:13,He just didn't want anything to do with it.
00:52:13,00:52:14,- Right. - Boy.
00:52:14,00:52:15,- Yeah.
00:52:15,00:52:17,- Was that the one that was used in All By Myself?
00:52:17,00:52:18,"No, different one."
00:52:18,00:52:19,"- No, no, no, no."
00:52:19,00:52:22,"The one that All By Myself is his second symphony,"
00:52:22,00:52:23,"which is an absolute classic,"
00:52:23,00:52:26,"and which is regularly voted on Classic FM,"
00:52:26,00:52:28,"you know, our favorite symphony."
00:52:28,00:52:30,"- But is that because most people listening are going,"
00:52:30,00:52:31,"oh, that's the Celine Dion song?"
00:52:31,00:52:33,"- Generally it is, I think it is, yeah."
00:52:33,00:52:36,"Rachmaninoff, massive hands."
00:52:36,00:52:37,- Is that so?
00:52:37,00:52:40,"- Yes, he can go 12 notes or something."
00:52:40,00:52:41,"- He could do 12 notes,"
00:52:41,00:52:43,but he could play a five note chord.
00:52:43,00:52:44,"So it's not just reaching,"
00:52:44,00:52:45,he could also play the first note.
00:52:45,00:52:46,- If he could play a chord.
00:52:46,00:52:48,"- Yeah, he could play the first one,"
00:52:48,00:52:50,"and then the second one is 12 notes away,"
00:52:50,00:52:52,and he could also play the three in between.
00:52:52,00:52:55,So that means your hand has to be even longer than the...
00:52:55,00:52:56,- But surely he's impossible to play then
00:52:56,00:52:58,for normal pianists with little fingers.
00:52:58,00:53:00,"- Actually, I think that is a problem that,"
00:53:00,00:53:02,"like, people with smaller hands"
00:53:02,00:53:03,"find it difficult to play Rachmaninoff,"
00:53:03,00:53:06,and also female pianists find it difficult
00:53:06,00:53:07,"to play Rachmaninoff 'cause they, on average,"
00:53:07,00:53:08,have smaller hands.
00:53:08,00:53:09,- Right. - Yeah.
00:53:09,00:53:10,"- It's weird because this is, Richard,"
00:53:10,00:53:12,"you don't know the full history of our show,"
00:53:12,00:53:13,but this is probably the third.
00:53:13,00:53:15,- I know the full history of your show.
00:53:15,00:53:16,"- Okay, okay."
00:53:16,00:53:19,"Then, as you will very well be aware of,"
00:53:19,00:53:21,this is the third historical figure I found
00:53:21,00:53:23,who has massive hands.
00:53:23,00:53:26,"George Eliot, the author."
00:53:26,00:53:28,"Stonewall Jackson, the Confederate general."
00:53:28,00:53:30,"He was convinced he had one giant arm,"
00:53:30,00:53:33,so he used to go into battle on horse
00:53:33,00:53:35,with his arm in the air so he could distribute
00:53:35,00:53:36,all the blood that that was hogging
00:53:36,00:53:38,to the rest of his body.
00:53:38,00:53:39,This is now the third.
00:53:39,00:53:41,"Rachmaninoff is in big hand territory,"
00:53:41,00:53:43,"big hand or not, the quiz."
00:53:43,00:53:44,"- I got it, I got it."
00:53:44,00:53:46,They say that about Vladimir Putin.
00:53:46,00:53:48,"Vladimir Putin, when he walks, you see,"
00:53:48,00:53:51,"he swings his left arm and he doesn't swing his right arm,"
00:53:51,00:53:54,so his right arm stays absolutely by his side.
00:53:54,00:53:56,"And for ages, people say that he's had a stroke,"
00:53:56,00:53:59,something has happened with Vladimir Putin.
00:53:59,00:54:01,"But you talk to anyone with any kind of knowledge of spying,"
00:54:01,00:54:05,"they go, no, that's KGB, 'cause that's where your gun is."
00:54:05,00:54:06,"So you would never, you wouldn't be kind of doing that."
00:54:06,00:54:08,Always have your hand when it's your gun.
00:54:08,00:54:09,"- No, fake arm, fake arm."
00:54:09,00:54:10,"- No, no, it's real."
00:54:10,00:54:14,"- No, shush, right hand is like holding the pistol."
00:54:14,00:54:17,"And then you got the fake arm, and that happens."
00:54:17,00:54:18,"- I'm with Andy, you see this all the time."
00:54:18,00:54:20,There's photos.
00:54:20,00:54:22,"- But I don't think Putin has a fake arm,"
00:54:22,00:54:23,that's what I'm saying.
00:54:23,00:54:26,"- Well, agreed to disagree, but."
00:54:26,00:54:29,"- I know he listens, so he probably can let us know."
00:54:29,00:54:32,"- Guys, I was listening to the show."
00:54:32,00:54:34,I won't do the voice.
00:54:34,00:54:36,"- That would be offensive, yeah."
00:54:36,00:54:37,- I think he's all right.
00:54:37,00:54:40,"- Oh, I don't want to offend Putin, oh my goodness."
00:54:40,00:54:43,"After all the good things he's done, no."
00:54:43,00:54:45,"- We do need to wrap up, but you see photos now"
00:54:45,00:54:48,"where all the security detail that are walking around,"
00:54:48,00:54:50,"major prominent politicians and leaders,"
00:54:50,00:54:53,"have their hands just stuck in a position,"
00:54:53,00:54:55,"and it's because they're wearing underneath their jacket,"
00:54:55,00:54:58,"fake arms, while they hold a little gun."
00:54:58,00:55:00,- This is genuinely true.
00:55:00,00:55:03,"- And it brings us back to Keith Harris, with Orville."
00:55:03,00:55:04,- He had a fake arm.
00:55:04,00:55:05,"- Of course he did, because he's got one hand up,"
00:55:05,00:55:09,"Orville's, you know Orville wasn't real, right?"
00:55:09,00:55:10,- Right.
00:55:10,00:55:13,"- Yeah, you know it was Keith who wasn't able to pretend"
00:55:13,00:55:15,that his sadness was going to end.
00:55:15,00:55:16,"You know that, don't you?"
00:55:16,00:55:19,- Are you saying that he was holding a gun inside or was?
00:55:19,00:55:20,- At all times.
00:55:20,00:55:22,- Was Orville working under duress?
00:55:22,00:55:25,"- Yeah, I'll go on pointless with you, absolutely."
00:55:25,00:55:27,"- Yeah, I wish I could fly right up to the sky,"
00:55:27,00:55:28,"you fucking won't in a minute, mate."
