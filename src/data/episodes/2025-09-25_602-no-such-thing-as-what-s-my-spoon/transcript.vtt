WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.340
 (upbeat music)

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:03.680
 - Hey everyone, Andy and Dan here.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:04.520
 - Hello.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.160
 - Before we, yep, there he is.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.160
 So this week's episode,

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.680
 which I wanna let you know is a live recording.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.160
 We did this a few weeks back at the London podcast festival

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.640
 and as Anna is away on maternity at the moment,

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.560
 we had a very exciting guest join us.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.600
 And that was Richard Osman.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.000
 - Yes, Richard is here, partly for the love of the game,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.080
 but partly because he's also got a new book out.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.160
 It is the fifth in the Thursday Murder Club series.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.040
 If you haven't heard of this, I'm amazed

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.760
 'cause it is a global multi-million selling series.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.240
 It's absolutely fantastic.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.080
 I have read all four previous outings

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.060
 of the Thursday Murder Club.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.000
 They're all great.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.280
 I cannot wait to get my tea stuck into the new one,

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.720
 which is out right now.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.800
 It has just come out.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.880
 It is called The Impossible Fortune

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.320
 and it's gonna be terrific.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.160
 I know it.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.520
 - Yeah, it really is an amazing series.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.360
 I like Andy.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.280
 I've read them all really excited for this one.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.280
 And on top of it, you know,

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.320
 Richard arrives to do our show in the craziest of weeks

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.160
 because not only is his book coming out,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.880
 but also the Thursday Murder Club

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.720
 has been converted into a movie.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.840
 It's on Netflix.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.240
 It stars Helen Mirren.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.860
 It's got Pierce Brosnan.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.920
 It's directed by Chris Columbus of Home Alone

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.760
 and Harry Potter.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.240
 Spielberg's got his name as an exec.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.120
 It's an amazing cast and collection of creatives.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.340
 So if you wanna check out the first book in movie form,

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.440
 that's up now.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.160
 - Yeah, but Dan, speaking of all this book stuff,

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.440
 are we going near any book world events anytime soon?

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.280
 - I believe we are, Andy.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.480
 I believe we are back on stage live,

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.360
 doing something similar to what you are about to hear,

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.720
 except as it's in the future,

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.040
 you can come and be in the audience for it.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.400
 It's the Cheltenham Literary Festival

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.960
 and we are gonna be doing it live

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.160
 with special guest, Rachel Parris.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.480
 - Yes, it's gonna be on the 16th of October,

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.040
 8 p.m., Cheltenham, live, unplugged.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.880
 We will be plugged in.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.720
 There will be electrics.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.840
 It's gonna be so much fun.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.360
 You can get your ticket right now

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.560
 at no such thing as a fish.com/live,

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.120
 but hurry, tickets are going like hot books.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.960
 - Hot books?

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.880
 - Yep.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.860
 Just go along with it, mate.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.000
 - All right, well listen, if you wanna see us live

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.800
 and you'll get a little taster of it now,

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.040
 go to the website as Andy says, book your tickets

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.760
 and join us in the room for the recording.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:10.840
 So let's hear this one now.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.920
 It is Richard Osman.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.080
 We know such thing as a fish.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.080
 On with the show.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.920
 - Yay!

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.500
 (upbeat music)

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:32.080
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.200
 of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast,

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.640
 this week coming to you live

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.000
 from the London Podcast Festival.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 (audience cheering)

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.840
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.840
 I am sitting here with James Harkin

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.480
 and Andrew Hunter Murray and Richard Osman.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.040
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.760
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.040
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.600
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Richard.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.760
 - One nominee for best TV show at the first Emmys

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.800
 was the masked Spooner.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.360
 It was like the masked singer,

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.960
 except the celebrity was spooning rather than singing.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.480
 - So that was what year, Richard?

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.960
 - 1949.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.760
 - And you've got to guess who's spooning you?

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:23.600
 - Yeah.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.880
 - Which celebrity is spooning you?

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.720
 - Yeah.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.280
 - It feels like a format that wouldn't get made these days.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.560
 - Big spoon or a little spoon, do we know?

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.080
 - Spooning is sort of a misnomer.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.760
 Nobody was cradling anybody at this stage.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.120
 Spooning was a mixture of spoken word and crooning.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.320
 So the masked Spooner, who is a, well,

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.720
 we'll get onto who it was

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.400
 because you had to try and guess who it was,

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.120
 but they never told you.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.080
 And that's why the masked Spooner

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.640
 I think didn't do quite as well as the masked singer,

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.160
 because you'd have a whole episode.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.160
 And at the end, you wouldn't have Jonathan Ross going,

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.000
 is it Bono?

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.960
 And then you go, no, it's former home secretary,

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:00.960
 Alan Johnson.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.800
 (audience laughing)

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.080
 I should have sworn it was Bono.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.800
 Next week, I bet it's Bono next week.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.560
 No, it's someone from Emmerdale.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.600
 - Yeah.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.440
 - So he would essentially turn up at places

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.440
 and he would sing to people in a mask

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.720
 and you would constantly be asked who he was

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.920
 and you would go, oh, gosh, I bet it's Alan Ladd.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.640
 And they go, no, guess again.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.560
 Oh, I don't know any other celebrities from the 1940s.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.800
 Well, unlucky.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.720
 But then at the end they go, see you next week.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.560
 - Wow.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.480
 - And that was the masked Spooner.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.040
 It won't surprise you to know it didn't win the Emmy.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.240
 - Yes, it did not.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.560
 Pantamime Quiz won the Emmy that year, I believe.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.720
 - I don't know, it didn't.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.960
 (audience laughing)

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.600
 - That was a charades thing, basically.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.720
 So you would have two teams.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.240
 There were four people in each team.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.400
 Three of the members of one team would always be the same

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.640
 and they'd have a rotating guest

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.640
 and then you would have them acting out like charades.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.160
 And 1949, that probably was mind-blowing.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.840
 - Yeah, I mean, to have a rotating guest for a start.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:00.800
 (audience laughing)

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.480
 They're like, they haven't seen that before.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.320
 - These are-

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.560
 - Tied to a spit in the middle of the studio.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.480
 - These are, by the way, the other shows

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.320
 that were nominated.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.600
 You had Armchair Detective,

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.160
 which sounded really great, actually.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.080
 I don't know if you read into that,

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.920
 but Armchair Detective-

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:12.800
 - Can I guess?

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.640
 - Yep.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.440
 - Every crime, every week.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.000
 Someone's been killed, but in a chair.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.840
 - Yeah.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:18.960
 - You're right so far.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.480
 - Oh, no.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.320
 - What, is he?

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.160
 - Okay, so someone's killed it.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.800
 Great, just go with it, go with it.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.400
 - I actually, that was just a pun you missed.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.040
 You're right so far.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.880
 You're right.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:29.720
 I was just trying to-

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.560
 - Oh my God.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.080
 - So it's, we're in Los Angeles.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.160
 The city of sin.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.480
 (audience laughing)

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.840
 - You see, and that's how you do a pun, Dan.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.440
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.760
 - Well, it sounds like an Armchair Cop.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.600
 - Yeah.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.320
 - It's sort of a very specialized unit in the police,

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.160
 I would say.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.560
 - What it was is, it was a show where they would put on

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.320
 a drama in which someone is murdered,

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.600
 and you at home had a chance to guess who it was.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.320
 So, and they had a panel as well live who would sit there.

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.640
 So you would watch the drama,

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.240
 and then they would stop at a moment for you to deliberate,

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.240
 and then they would actually show you what happened.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.400
 - Do you know what, there was an actual show on TV in Britain

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.840
 about two or three years ago with the exact same name

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:09.920
 and the exact same format

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.400
 that Susan Kalman hosted, wasn't it?

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.240
 - Correct.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.080
 - Really?

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.160
 - Is there no such thing as a new idea, Richard?

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.600
 - Well, I would say that the mask spooner at the time

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.440
 was a new idea.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.560
 (audience laughing)

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.200
 - But today, is it like a lot of the new formats,

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.960
 the kind of old formats that are--

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:24.800
 - Of course, yeah.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.480
 People want something that's a tiny, tiny, tiny bit different

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.600
 to what they've seen before.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.440
 - Right.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:30.280
 - That's all you want.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.480
 Like when the Traders comes out, every single channel goes,

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.800
 I tell you what people would like,

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.440
 something that's a bit like the Traders, but worse.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.960
 (audience laughing)

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.720
 And that's how TV has always worked.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.360
 When we did Deal or No Deal, my God, the next five years,

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.880
 some of the worst television programs

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.560
 in the history of the world came out,

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.400
 where people just went,

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.720
 "Oh, people just like random stuff, do they?"

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.560
 "Okay, we'll do that."

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.600
 And channel five did Heads or Tails,

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.120
 which is a whole week of Justin Lee Collins flipping a coin.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.280
 (audience laughing)

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.400
 And then Simon Kal did the same thing with Red or Black,

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.160
 which was Choose Red or Choose Black,

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.200
 and I'll give you a million pounds.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.800
 - Oh, that was Anton Deck?

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.040
 - Yeah, it was Anton Deck.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.640
 It was a million pounds and still nobody watched.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:05.800
 - Really? - Can you imagine?

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.640
 - Wow.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.200
 - I watched a clip of that earlier today

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.680
 while researching this, and I found it compelling.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.240
 I really, like, if I'd known at the time,

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.560
 I would have been hooked.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.560
 - Well, no, but compelling in that sort of, you know,

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.720
 a Netflix documentary about a poop cruise,

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.920
 rather than I would love to watch this live.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:22.740
 - Yeah.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:24.000
 - Have you got some more of those?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.240
 - Yeah, yeah, there was one called

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.760
 "What's the Name of That Song?"

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.600
 - Can you guess what that format was?

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.720
 (audience laughing)

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.720
 - God, I think you could do it.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.040
 - I love that.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:33.880
 - It was quite nice.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:34.720
 The first ever Emmys,

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.600
 there was only about five awards that were given out,

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.280
 but the special award was my favorite.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.360
 The special award went to Louis McManus,

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:46.120
 who was awarded the Emmy for designing the Emmy statue.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:46.960
 - That's clever.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:47.960
 - For the Emmy. - Oh, that's easy.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:48.800
 - Yeah.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.720
 - Does anyone know why the Emmys are called the Emmys,

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:51.540
 by the way?

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:53.200
 - Named after a person?

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.040
 - No.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:54.880
 - Oh.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.560
 - So we think, so the Tonys are named after a person.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.120
 The Oscars are sort of named after,

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.400
 I mean, there's also several versions

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.240
 of why the Oscars are called the Oscars,

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.560
 but the Emmys, I thought maybe they'd be like M-E,

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.480
 or something like musical entertainment awards,

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.320
 but it's not, I'll tell you,

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:12.040
 there are, you know, the cathode ray in your television.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:12.880
 They have the same sort of thing,

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:13.880
 but in video cameras,

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.200
 and there were two competing versions of this

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.960
 in the '30s and '40s, right?

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:22.400
 There was the RCA image orthicon tube,

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.800
 that was the first one,

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:27.920
 and then there was the EMI Emitron, okay?

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.240
 So we've got the RCA image orthicon tube

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.120
 and the EMI Emitron.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.920
 Now, you've been doing this show long enough,

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:35.440
 but if I ask you the question,

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.680
 which of those two were the Emmys named after?

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:38.920
 (laughing)

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:40.400
 What would you go for?

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.240
 - I've got the Emitron.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.120
 - The Emitron, yeah.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:42.960
 - You'd be wrong.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.480
 (laughing)

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.080
 It is named after the RCA image orthicon tube,

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.560
 which they used to call an EMI.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.400
 So someone said, "Oh, we should call these the Emmys,"

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.760
 'cause that's the industry we're in.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:54.600
 - Oh my God.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.120
 - Because the Louis MacManus made the statue into a woman,

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.800
 they said, "Oh, why don't we call it EMI

00:08:58.800 --> 00:08:59.640
 "instead of EMI?"

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:00.600
 So it became the Emmys.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.440
 - Brilliant.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.280
 - But named after the orthicon tube

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.840
 rather than the Emitron.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:04.920
 (laughing)

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.160
 Which, by the way, was made by EMI, which also--

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.840
 - What it should have been called was the Dorothy,

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:13.160
 because that's who Louis modeled it after, his wife.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.280
 - Oh, but everyone's always modeling after their wives,

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:16.120
 weren't they? - Yeah.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.800
 - But all those statues, yeah.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.120
 - I think the Rolls Royce is a bit racier.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.000
 Isn't the Rolls Royce a mistress or something?

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:22.840
 - Yes.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.640
 - Silver sprite figure on the front of a Rolls Royce.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:25.480
 - Yes, yeah.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:29.080
 - Isn't the Statue of Liberty like the face is his mother

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.680
 and the body is his wife?

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.000
 - Wow.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.200
 - There's something like-- - What?

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.480
 - That is a very, very nice fetish, isn't it?

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:36.320
 - Yeah.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:37.160
 (laughing)

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.000
 - And you know what?

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.600
 I'm gonna make a 200 feet high.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.440
 - Yeah.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.280
 (laughing)

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.360
 - I'm just, I'm sure we'll move on

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.600
 and talk about more TV formats and things like that,

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:48.800
 but I have a little quiz for you of spoon-related slang.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:49.640
 - Oh.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:50.880
 - 'Cause we were on the Masked Spooner.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:51.720
 - The Masked Spooner.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.040
 - Actual spoons.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.400
 - Well, you'll see.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.720
 (laughing)

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.720
 So part of the reason that the Masked Spooner

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.800
 was a bit cheeky was that spooning,

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.400
 to mean cuddling up to someone,

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:05.440
 was dates from 1887, I think.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.320
 - Yeah, so he knew it was a double untied.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.960
 - He knew it was a bit cheeky, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.240
 And there are all these references.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:13.000
 It's also a cricketing term dating back to 1836,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.240
 meaning a weak stroke.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:18.120
 But anyway, it's spooning dates to 1887.

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.640
 Now spoon me, Stirling stretched himself out

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.240
 on the warm flagstone and the boy nestled up against him.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.240
 I don't know the context,

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.800
 I just know that that's what was happening.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:26.640
 - Do you know what?

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.840
 That's my favorite of your novels.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:32.480
 That is a bit cheap to promote it on the show, but...

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.960
 - Okay, to stick one spoon in the wall.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:35.960
 What does that mean?

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.480
 - Are they from Urban Dictionary or something, so?

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.200
 - Are you sure it's not to stick one spoon in the walls?

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.600
 Because that's an ice cream reference, that's easier.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.080
 That's much easier.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.600
 To stick one spoon in the wall?

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.680
 - Yeah, to stick one spoon in the wall.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.720
 - Is it to try and do something that's almost impossible?

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.880
 - No, it's very possible.

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.020
 We all do it.

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:53.860
 - Oh, we do?

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:54.700
 - Yeah.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:56.560
 - Oh, is it like Shawshank Redemption?

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:57.400
 - Oh yeah.

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.280
 - Oh, it's older than that.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.000
 It's from the 19th century, so it's pre-Shawshank.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 - Okay.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 - Shall I tell you?

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:04.840
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:07.160
 - It's to die.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:08.000
 Oh.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.880
 As you're doing on stage right now.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.140
 (laughing)

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:15.800
 - Okay.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.760
 - I'm not sure we even want round two.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.560
 I'm not sure we've earned round two.

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:20.400
 - Definitely do.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:21.440
 I mean, good luck topping that.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.760
 - Yeah.

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.840
 - I put the strongest one first.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:27.160
 (laughing)

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.280
 - To stick one spoon.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.440
 I'd love it if a doctor ever said that you,

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.960
 Mr. Hunter Murray, I'm ever so sorry.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:32.800
 We did everything we could,

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.160
 but I'm afraid your mother has stuck a spoon in the wall.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.400
 (laughing)

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:41.320
 - Oh my God.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.120
 - To fill the mouth with empty spoons.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.880
 - To fill your mouth.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.760
 - To fill the mouth with empty spoons.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:48.600
 - False promises.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:49.440
 - To waste your time.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.280
 - False promises, wasting your time.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:51.120
 - Wasting your time.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:51.960
 - Lying.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:52.780
 - Lying.

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:54.880
 It's someone in the audience said it's just being hungry.

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:55.720
 - Oh.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.080
 - Weird, these didn't catch on.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:58.920
 - Yeah.

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:02.720
 - Well, a spoon can also be a second rate coachman,

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:06.280
 a penis, a shovel, 1/16 of an ounce of heroin,

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:08.840
 or a newly qualified prison officer.

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:09.680
 - Okay.

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:10.520
 - Yeah.

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:11.760
 - There's lots of times where you can say

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:13.120
 stick in your spoon in the wall,

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.120
 and depending on which spoon you're talking about,

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.760
 it could mean something very true.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:17.760
 - Very true.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.440
 - Richard, just as someone who's created

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:22.680
 some of the most defining quizzes of our time.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.040
 - And some of the worst, to be fair.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:24.880
 - Okay.

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.080
 - Where does Andy's What's My Spoon rank on?

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.720
 - I would say fairly highly up,

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.560
 when I think of some of my stuff.

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.200
 I mean, yeah, it feels like maybe,

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.600
 I'm not sure it's a runner.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.480
 Like series two, I don't think people are going,

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.040
 oh, I wonder what more spoon stuff

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.680
 Andrew has for us this week.

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:43.520
 - Yep.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:44.360
 - That sort of work.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:47.160
 But if you moved it out to other utensils,

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.920
 so the first one is what the spoon,

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:50.080
 second one, what the fork.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.080
 - Yeah.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.400
 - See, there's the fork.

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:53.520
 - We've got ourselves something.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:54.960
 - It's not the end of your quiz, Andy.

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:55.800
 - I'm afraid.

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:56.640
 - Okay.

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.440
 - I just want to quickly say a little bit more

00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.560
 about the Mask Spooner.

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:00.400
 - Yeah.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.280
 - Because this was the kind of thing,

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.120
 it started off as a bit of a meme.

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.800
 So there was this guy who's going around like restaurants

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.680
 and bars and he was always wearing this outfit,

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.480
 which it's like got a mask on and he's got a hood.

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.920
 You can't really see what he is.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.200
 And then all the Hollywood magazines started writing

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.040
 about him and saying,

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:18.040
 who is the Mask Spooner who's going around?

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.360
 And actually it became a bit of a thing

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.560
 where people guessing in magazines and newspapers

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:22.560
 who he was.

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:25.000
 And then the TV show was almost a spin-off.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:25.840
 - Okay.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:26.680
 - And yeah, and he got like,

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.640
 he was getting marriage proposals from people.

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.160
 And yet he never gave away the secret.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.200
 And in the end, it felt like he was kind of holding on

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.640
 to give it away, give it away.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:37.840
 But in the end, everyone just gave up

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:39.200
 and didn't really care anymore.

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.040
 - Yeah.

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:40.880
 - Do we know who he was?

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:41.720
 - We do know now, yeah.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.120
 Because when he was going around to all these restaurants

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.920
 and the newspapers were writing about him,

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:50.200
 they heard about him from his friend called Jack Rook.

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.400
 And Jack Rook would say,

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:55.600
 oh, the Mask Spooner is going to be in the old bar

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.400
 in Soho tonight.

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.600
 And actually it was him.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.760
 - Yeah.

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:00.600
 And here's the thing,

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:03.040
 Jack Rook was big in his own right at the time.

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:06.040
 He wasn't an anonymous character that you would just,

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:06.880
 when you heard his name,

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.280
 it was like Jack Rook,

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:09.880
 it'd be like saying Richard Osmond,

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:13.400
 he was a huge force in the world of entertainment in America.

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.360
 He effectively created,

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:18.380
 or at least popularized from massive scale, telephones.

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:20.600
 And I think the word itself was almost coined

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.920
 by Jack Rook, telephone.

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:22.760
 - I think it was, yeah.

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:25.240
 - The Mask Spooner invented telephones.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.080
 - Yeah?

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:26.920
 - Yeah.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.720
 - He also invented the political debate on camera,

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:30.560
 on screen.

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:32.120
 So when, was it Nixon?

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:32.960
 I think it was Nixon.

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.680
 - He did a big show with Nixon, yeah.

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:36.240
 - Yeah, big Nixon fan.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.680
 - He did a telephone for Nixon

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.600
 and raised loads of money for his election.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.160
 - Can I just say a sad thing about this though?

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:46.360
 In 1994, Jack Rook finally stuck his spoon in the wall.

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.940
 (all laughing)

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:52.020
 - Yeah.

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.020
 - It's gonna catch on.

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:53.860
 - Isn't it a shame?

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:54.700
 - It's gonna catch on.

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:55.820
 - I don't know how else to put it.

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:57.660
 (all laughing)

00:14:57.660 --> 00:14:58.780
 - I was trying to find TV shows

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:00.300
 which have where everyone is in a mask,

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:01.420
 or someone is in a mask.

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:02.260
 - Oh yeah, that's it.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:03.740
 - And there was an amazing TV show

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:05.140
 that you may or may not have heard of.

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:07.400
 It was called Mr. Personality, right?

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:11.140
 2003, American, it's a dating show.

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:14.620
 And there was one woman called Hailey Arp,

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:18.720
 who was going, she was wanting to get married,

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:19.600
 wanting to find love.

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:23.200
 And there were 20 suitors, guys,

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.960
 and they were trying to catch her eye

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.960
 and she was wanting to be picked by her in the show.

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:32.120
 But they were all wearing intense iron masks,

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:37.120
 or sometimes like rubbery, quite gimpy masks,

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:39.600
 throughout the series.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.320
 - And was that her thing?

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.720
 - No, no, not at all.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:45.020
 - It wasn't their thing either, like it was nobody's thing.

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:45.860
 - And it was-

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:46.700
 - Apart from one of them, one of them,

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:47.540
 was that your thing?

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:48.360
 (all laughing)

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.200
 So you go, do you know what,

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:51.220
 I might not go for number seven.

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:53.420
 He has been erected the entire series.

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:56.000
 (all laughing)

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.900
 - It was actually won by a man called Will Dick,

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:03.100
 funny you say that, but.

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:05.460
 (all laughing)

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:07.420
 And they were only allowed to remove their masks

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:09.900
 in a pitch black room and she would feel their faces

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:11.340
 and then they put the mask back on.

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:13.440
 Monica Lewinsky was the host, obviously.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.280
 - No.

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:15.320
 - Wait, wait.

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.320
 I would like, and frankly,

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.040
 the second worst decision she's ever made

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:19.520
 was to host this show.

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.480
 And it was an absolute disaster.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.320
 - Amazing.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:24.560
 - The men didn't even know they were gonna be in masks

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:26.760
 until they turned up on the first day of shooting.

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:27.600
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.080
 - So can you pop this on for the next five weeks?

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:29.920
 - Right.

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:30.760
 - Disaster.

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:32.080
 - But they all would have said yes, they'd go,

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.200
 yeah, okay, that's the thing where people can't tell you.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:37.080
 Especially in like 2003, anyone would have done anything.

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:37.920
 - Yeah.

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:38.760
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.960
 - We pretended to send people to space.

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:41.800
 The show called Space Cadets.

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:42.620
 - Were you part of that?

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:43.460
 - What was your show?

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:44.300
 - I mean, I wasn't.

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:45.140
 But was I part of it?

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:45.960
 That's a good question.

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:46.960
 What's your view on it?

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.840
 (audience laughing)

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:51.640
 No, I, with two of us, we're going,

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.880
 what's the biggest practical joke you could ever pull?

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:54.720
 - Yeah.

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.260
 - And we said, I wonder if you could convince people

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:57.760
 they'd ever been to space.

00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.280
 And any time when we pitched it, they said,

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:00.820
 yeah, but sure, but you're not floating.

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:02.320
 And you go, yeah, you don't float in space

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.280
 'cause of the vacuum seal.

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:04.120
 They went, okay.

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:05.980
 (audience laughing)

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:06.940
 I'm like two weeks late to go.

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:07.780
 Is that true?

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:08.780
 You go, no, but you believed it.

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:11.360
 (upbeat music)

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:17.320
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two.

00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:19.760
 And that is Andy.

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:23.440
 - My fact is, in 1990, most of the red kite birds

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:27.000
 in England had arrived here by British Airways.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.040
 So this is about the red kite.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.460
 This is a beautiful bird.

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:32.080
 And they're kind of all over the place these days.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.000
 In the '90s, they were absolutely not.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.480
 At the worst, I think they got down

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:38.680
 to like five breeding pairs in Wales.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:39.980
 And you had to go to Central Wales

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:41.940
 to have even a sniff of a red kite.

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:45.580
 And they had this project, Mike Pionkowski was a guy

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:47.420
 from the Joint Nature Conservation Committee

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:50.300
 and his colleague Colin Galbraith and lots of colleagues.

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:52.820
 They knew this bird was declining a bit across Europe,

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:55.500
 but in England, there hadn't been any for about 400 years.

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.460
 - It was about to put its spoon bit in the wall.

00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:58.300
 (audience laughing)

00:17:58.300 --> 00:17:59.620
 - Oh my God.

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:00.460
 Oh my God.

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:01.300
 - Andy, lean into it.

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:02.380
 He's gonna get you a TV show under this.

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:04.700
 - You're right, you're right.

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:06.580
 And they thought, well, maybe we could restore them

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:10.320
 in England and they imported maybe a dozen

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.280
 from Navarra in Spain.

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:13.840
 And they arrived on British Airways.

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:16.320
 Amazingly, they were flown in the main cabin

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.520
 with paying customers.

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:21.240
 So as you got on, there was a load of boxes

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.040
 on the seats strapped in.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.520
 Now that's a film, that's a film.

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:28.080
 - What, boxed red kites on a plane?

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:31.120
 - I think something happens, right?

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.120
 - It's not--

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:34.440
 - No, my film is about the conservation effort.

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:36.780
 It's like nothing happens.

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:38.340
 (audience laughing)

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:39.620
 And basically, the population has grown

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:41.780
 two and a half thousand percent since 1995.

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:42.780
 And it's a massive--

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:43.620
 - That's pretty good.

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:45.660
 - Now they're reaching seagull status

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:46.780
 in the rest of the country.

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:47.960
 - I read that they're getting to the point

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.260
 where schools aren't allowing the kids

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.780
 to eat lunch outside because they're swooping down

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:54.540
 and trying to steal their lunch.

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:55.540
 - Is that right?

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:57.660
 I read that when they did come over,

00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:00.940
 they spread initially along the M40 corridor

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:03.100
 because there were so many dead animals

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:03.940
 by the side of the road.

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:05.600
 - And that's what they love to eat.

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:06.440
 - Yeah, they're scavengers, aren't they?

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:07.820
 - That's a lovely thought, isn't it?

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:09.120
 (audience laughing)

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:11.680
 - And the reason that there weren't so many of them

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.760
 is because they were all killed, basically, right?

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:16.520
 So they like to eat dead things,

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:19.480
 but if a farmer sees them eating like a dead lamb

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.760
 or something like that, they haven't killed the lamb,

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.880
 but the farmer thinks that they might have done.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:26.120
 And so during the Tudor times,

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:29.400
 there was a thing called the Vermin Act of 1566.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.080
 And that said that if you killed a red kite

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:34.180
 and you could prove it, you'd get some cash.

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:35.700
 And so people basically went out

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:37.660
 and killed as many of them as they could.

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:39.180
 And the idea was to help the farmers,

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:40.260
 but of course we now know

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:41.900
 that it didn't really help them at all.

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:44.260
 Also, if you killed a hedgehog,

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:46.060
 you could get up to four pence,

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:47.140
 which doesn't sound a lot,

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:49.780
 but that could buy you 20 pints of beer

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:52.300
 in Elizabethan prices for one hedgehog.

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:53.140
 - Really?

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:53.980
 - Wow.

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:55.620
 - Getting you a certain number of pints

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:56.860
 means nothing to me recently

00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:58.420
 since I discovered weather spoons

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:00.260
 because up until recently,

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:04.200
 you could get a pint of Ruddles for 99p.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.200
 99p.

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:08.600
 I could go to the bar with a 20 pound note

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.800
 and come back with 20 pints.

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:11.720
 - Or one hedgehog.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:12.920
 (laughing)

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:13.760
 - Yeah.

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.160
 - Danny, have you taken another advertising gig

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:17.000
 on the side?

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.720
 - No.

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:21.280
 - But Ruddles is a fine, fine beer.

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:22.520
 (laughing)

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:23.360
 - And affordable.

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:24.200
 - Wow.

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.040
 - It's actually gone up controversially

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:27.200
 to like a pound 49 now or something like that.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.000
 It's me and the other guys at 9 a.m.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.740
 and the weather spoons are furious.

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:33.020
 (laughing)

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:34.140
 Anyway, back to Red Kites.

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:34.980
 - Yeah, sure.

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:35.820
 - Yeah.

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:37.100
 - That's the most animated I've seen Dan

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:38.340
 in any other side of the world.

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:40.460
 (laughing)

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:42.380
 Finally discover what he's interested in.

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:44.060
 (laughing)

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:45.860
 - Do you know one other thing Red Kites do?

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:47.940
 This is, no, there's been a big vote

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:50.540
 for wild swimming, as I'm sure you know.

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:54.740
 And a lot of people like to swim, oh, natural.

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:55.580
 - Where's this going?

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:57.060
 We know they can kill lambs.

00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:58.820
 (laughing)

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:01.540
 They sometimes will steal your clothes

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:03.320
 if you're wild swimming in a river.

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:05.380
 They would nick your clothes to line their nest.

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:06.220
 - Oh yeah.

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:08.480
 - And then some Red Kite chick has a, you know,

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.220
 lovely pair of white fronts.

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:11.440
 - I've heard this.

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:14.640
 They found nests with a teddy bear's head in it,

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.000
 a tea towel in it.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.200
 And in 2006, they found a nest

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.100
 with a St. George's flag in it.

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:23.340
 It might have been painted in by a local.

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:25.540
 (laughing)

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:27.320
 But it was discovered less than an hour

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:30.300
 before England's World Cup match against Paraguay.

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:31.820
 And so it hit the newspapers

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:35.120
 that this was very patriotic, Red Kite.

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.200
 - Did we win that match?

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.460
 - Against Paraguay, I can't, I think we did, yeah.

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:40.660
 - Do you know what their Latin name is?

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:41.500
 - Red Kite.

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:44.420
 - Yeah, it's Milvus Milvus.

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:45.780
 Do you know what Milvus means?

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:46.620
 - No.

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:47.460
 - Bird.

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:48.780
 (laughing)

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:51.260
 They're called Bird Bird.

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:53.580
 Linnaeus called them Falco Milvus,

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:56.140
 but then Milvus became its own genus.

00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:58.240
 And so then it got renamed

00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.280
 and Milvus was put in front of it.

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:00.760
 So they're Milvus Milvus.

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:01.600
 - That's very funny.

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:02.520
 - Yeah, Bird Bird.

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:03.460
 - Very good.

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:05.080
 - It is a problem, we should say.

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:06.800
 It's a great story of reintroduction

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.720
 of a really precarious species,

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.080
 but they are eating people's lunch,

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.160
 and that is a problem.

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:14.560
 Article this spring from the Henley Standard.

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:16.600
 Red Kite stole my hummus.

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:18.920
 (laughing)

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:20.760
 Jeff Hay, 72 years old,

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:23.320
 was having some nice hummus in his garden.

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:28.320
 And got swooped on, predated, and scratched.

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:31.060
 And it was the third time in five years

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:33.020
 that a Red Kite has snatched food from him

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:36.140
 while he was eating outside.

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:37.340
 - He sounds careless.

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:40.780
 - I got some stuff on things that have been on aeroplanes

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:42.900
 that feel quite out of place.

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:46.220
 I'm a big comedy fan, and Tony Hancock.

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:48.260
 You must have loved Tony Hancock growing up.

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:52.300
 - I mean, I'm not 70, but move on.

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:54.080
 - When did he die, when did he die?

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.520
 - I can't actually remember, I think.

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.640
 - It certainly was before I was 10.

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:58.480
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:01.360
 - No, sorry, I'm not suggesting that you saw it live.

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:04.640
 - I think Hancock's half hour was on TV

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:05.480
 when I was a kid for sure.

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:07.480
 - Yeah, I think a lot of us grew up on Hancock's half hour.

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:10.280
 - Yes, I don't think I grew up watching Hancock's half hour.

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:11.280
 - Sorry to--

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:13.120
 - No, good lesson to just say the fact

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:17.120
 and not accuse you of a childhood memory you don't have.

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:19.400
 So basically, Tony Hancock, for anyone

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:20.400
 who doesn't know him apparently--

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:22.120
 - Oh, Tony Hancock, I thought you meant Nick Hancock.

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:22.960
 I'm so sorry.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:27.260
 - Tony Hancock was one of the great British comedians.

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:29.940
 - He was the one who said, in the blood donor,

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:32.940
 he said, you know, a pint that's nearly an arm full

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:33.780
 or something, right?

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:34.620
 - Yes.

00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:36.220
 - He was the one who had an affair, wasn't he,

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:40.340
 with the wife of the guy he ran Oliver Bonus during COVID?

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:42.500
 Have I got it right now?

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:43.340
 - That's, yeah, you--

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:44.180
 - Is that the right Hancock?

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:45.020
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:46.580
 - That's the right Hancock.

00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:48.060
 - I think, "What's My Hancock?"

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:49.620
 Could be the next game show, I think.

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:50.460
 - There you go.

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.940
 (audience laughing)

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:54.340
 - And it's called Hancock's Half Hour.

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:55.340
 It's a half hour format.

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:56.180
 - Oh my God.

00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:57.020
 - Yes. - Roll it.

00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:57.860
 - Roll it.

00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:00.220
 So, he was what?

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:02.560
 - This had better be spectacular.

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:03.900
 (audience laughing)

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:06.380
 Given the investment we've all made.

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:07.220
 - Yeah.

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:09.260
 - If this was just Tony Hancock was once on a plane,

00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:11.100
 it's just going to be very disappointing.

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:12.380
 (audience laughing)

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:14.540
 - Tony Hancock was coming back from Australia.

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:16.940
 He was sitting next to Willie Rushton who's another,

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:19.500
 you must have grown up on Willie Rushton, Richard.

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:22.340
 - See him, he, I did, he, I did.

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:23.900
 - And so they were sat on a plane

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:27.500
 and one of the stewards came over

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:31.020
 and said, "Mr. Hancock, you belong in first class."

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:33.140
 And so Hancock went to first class,

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:35.680
 but Willie Rushton stayed in economy.

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:37.580
 And the interesting thing about that is Hancock

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:39.020
 was dead at the time.

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:40.860
 So he, yeah. - Oh, what?

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:43.220
 - He had sadly passed away in Australia.

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:44.060
 He took his own life.

00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:45.220
 He was quite a depressed character.

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:47.580
 And Willie Rushton happened to be in Australia

00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:49.100
 and he was cremated.

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:51.960
 He was put in an urn and they bought him a seat in economy.

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.540
 And an air steward came over and said,

00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:55.380
 "Someone would like to move seats to sit there."

00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:57.980
 And they said, "You can't, this is Tony Hancock."

00:24:57.980 --> 00:24:59.540
 And she said, "What the hell is he doing in economy?

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:01.100
 "He needs to be in first class."

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:05.060
 So she took him in an urn off to first class,

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:08.460
 while Willie Rushton just had to sit to a random person.

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:11.660
 So he went to pick up Tony Hancock at the end of the flight

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:13.940
 and there was a red rose and a little note saying,

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:16.740
 "Thank you for all the laughs on the seat next to it."

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:18.340
 Yeah. - That was quite good.

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:20.500
 That's annoying, isn't it? - Yeah, that was all right.

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:22.460
 - Same thing happened to Eric Morkham, didn't it?

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:24.060
 - Did it? - Eric and Urn, right?

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:25.220
 Yeah, flight together.

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:29.620
 - Come on guys, he's a guest.

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:31.260
 - Yeah.

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:33.100
 - Thank you, James.

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:34.460
 - Do you know what the world record is

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:36.860
 for the number of yaks on a Boeing 747?

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:39.780
 - Wow.

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:40.700
 - Eight.

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:41.860
 - Oh, it must be more.

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:43.060
 Nine.

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:43.900
 - Even higher.

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:45.420
 - Higher than a nine.

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:46.520
 - 14.

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:47.900
 - It's triple figures.

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:48.740
 - No.

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:53.740
 - Yes. - 116 yaks on a Boeing.

00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:54.980
 - No.

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:55.820
 - Yeah, not for fun.

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:58.420
 It was for a relocation program, but it was, yeah.

00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:00.700
 That was last year, so it feels like it's a beatable record.

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:03.180
 Like it feels like it's innovation in the space right now.

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:06.980
 - What's the fun version of that number of yaks on a plane?

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:09.780
 - Well, I'm scripting something.

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:11.900
 I don't wanna talk about it, but I...

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:14.940
 - Did they go in the seats?

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:15.780
 - Yep.

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:17.980
 (audience laughing)

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:19.540
 - Oh, did they go in the hold, I guess?

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:21.620
 - I think they always have to go in crates

00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:22.700
 and custom-made crates and things.

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:25.660
 When you're moving like Megaforna, you have to,

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:26.740
 you have to do that.

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:29.540
 - Yeah, when you're moving in Megaforna, James.

00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:30.380
 You have to...

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:31.220
 Do you know what?

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:32.060
 James is such an idiot.

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:32.900
 - I am like that.

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:33.740
 (audience laughing)

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:36.020
 - My God, have I ever met a man who knows less

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:37.780
 about moving Megaforna than James?

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:38.940
 (audience laughing)

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:41.620
 - Can I tell you something just to change the subject

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:42.900
 about moving Megaforna?

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:44.500
 (audience laughing)

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:47.060
 - So there's a company called Cargo Lux.

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:49.540
 It's a Luxembourg Guards company.

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:52.460
 And they have the tagline, "You name it, we fly it."

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:53.300
 And they fly...

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:56.380
 If you need a big animal moving from one place to another,

00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:57.900
 these are the guys you go to.

00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:59.100
 And a couple of years ago,

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:04.100
 they moved a beluga whale from China to Iceland.

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:05.180
 - Okay.

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:06.020
 - For fun?

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:06.860
 - Or...

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:09.860
 (audience laughing)

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:13.580
 - No, it was very serious.

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:16.780
 It was in a sanctuary, like an ocean sanctuary.

00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:18.140
 They wanted to move it to Iceland

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:20.300
 where it could live in the wild.

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:22.460
 And to cut a long story short,

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:24.420
 they just put it in a big hammock

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:26.060
 and keep pouring water on it.

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:26.980
 - Yeah, okay.

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:30.140
 - But they did, they kept it in very, very cold water

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:31.500
 for a couple of months beforehand.

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:34.660
 So it's blubber would get thicker for the journey because...

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:36.300
 - 'Cause it's cold on a plane?

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:37.740
 - Yeah, well, you have to keep your...

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:38.980
 You have to regulate your temperature

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:39.820
 and that's how they do it.

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:40.660
 - Yeah.

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:42.460
 And I guess it would be moving to colder waters as well,

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:43.380
 if it's going to say...

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:44.820
 - To Iceland, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:47.100
 It's just a thing that happened, but...

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:49.820
 And when they arrived in Keflavik,

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:52.700
 the locals gave them a salute of water,

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:55.500
 like they got hose pipes so that the plane could go

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:57.980
 through them, which sounds dangerous.

00:27:57.980 --> 00:27:59.780
 Especially in Iceland.

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:01.660
 - Yeah, true, yeah.

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:03.220
 Just on reintroducing things.

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:04.060
 - Oh, yeah?

00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:07.580
 - Would you guys like to see animals introduced to the UK?

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:09.300
 Show of cheers.

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:11.820
 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, which animals?

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:13.460
 And now we come to the meat.

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:16.980
 Okay, so animals that have gone extinct,

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:18.020
 that used to live in England,

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:19.540
 but have gone out of business here.

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:20.780
 - Okay.

00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:21.780
 - Beavers.

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:23.380
 - Beavers!

00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:24.620
 - That always gets a cheer.

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:26.780
 - I know, and beavers against?

00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:29.900
 - Boo, no beavers.

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:31.700
 - Who would like moose back?

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:33.380
 - Boo!

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:34.700
 - Did we ever have moose?

00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:35.740
 - We had moose.

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:36.580
 - Did we?

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:37.740
 - Yeah, we did.

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:42.100
 - So lots of people want beavers and like birds.

00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:44.100
 37% of people want moose back.

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:46.020
 37% want wild boar.

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:47.660
 Can I have a cheer for wolves?

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:52.940
 I think that's more than beavers or moose.

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:54.700
 - That's a lot of people who don't live in houses

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:55.540
 made of straw.

00:28:55.540 --> 00:29:01.740
 - But 31% of people would be up for wild wolves in the UK,

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:03.620
 which I think I'm up for.

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:05.700
 Okay, what about bears?

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:08.380
 - And again, these are people who are not living

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:09.740
 with the consequences.

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:12.140
 - What about wasps?

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:16.300
 - You see?

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:18.060
 You know what I mean, they'd rather have bears than wasps.

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:19.980
 Honestly, I think a bear would ruin your picnic

00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:21.740
 quicker than a wasp would, I think.

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:29.740
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:31.580
 and that is James.

00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:35.380
 - Okay, my fact this week is that this year at Poundland,

00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:39.100
 if you had one pound, you could buy a tin of Pilchats,

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:44.100
 a water pistol, or all 825 UK Poundland stores.

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:48.020
 - That's, yeah.

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:50.380
 - So yeah, I mean, you wouldn't be able to go in

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:52.100
 with your quid and say, can I have them?

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:53.940
 There has to be some lawyers involved in stuff,

00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:57.940
 but the fact is that Poundland was sold this year for one pound.

00:29:57.940 --> 00:29:59.860
 - Wow, plus 10p for the bag.

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:04.380
 - And this is the thing,

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:07.820
 like it's a thing in UK law if you want to buy a company,

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:10.020
 and let's say they have loads and loads of debts,

00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:11.660
 so they're not really worth very much,

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:13.220
 but you want to buy the brand or whatever.

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:15.300
 In theory, you think you could just pay nothing for that

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:17.060
 because you know, you're taking on debt,

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:19.220
 but in that actual fact, you have to swap something

00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:21.540
 between you in order for it to make a contract,

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:24.340
 and usually when they do that, they do one pound.

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:26.300
 And there's been lots of things that have been bought

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:28.140
 and sold for one pound.

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:30.740
 Ken Bates bought Chelsea Football Club for one pound

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:35.060
 in 1982, and then sold it to Roman Abramovich

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:40.060
 for £140 million, about 20 years later, so you know.

00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:42.580
 - That's a good investment.

00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:43.420
 - She is.

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:46.420
 - Probably could buy half a defender with that, couldn't you?

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:48.820
 - Portsmouth, Swansea City, Hull City, Bolton Wanderers,

00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:50.140
 and Notts County have all been bought

00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:52.100
 for one pound in their history.

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:54.420
 Notts County, the oldest football team as well.

00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:57.180
 - Oh yes, Aston Villa, they were bought for a pound.

00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:58.020
 - Were they?

00:30:58.020 --> 00:30:59.300
 - Yeah, but if you buy a tin of Piltrons,

00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:02.020
 no one says that does come with £200 million worth of debt.

00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:04.900
 - Exactly, that is the difference.

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:08.420
 So yeah, they were sold by a Polish firm called PEPCO

00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:11.420
 to a US investment firm called Gordon Brothers.

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:12.820
 - Do you know what's really sad about this?

00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:17.820
 Is that I could buy 825 UK Poundland stores with my pound,

00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:21.140
 yet I wouldn't be able to buy a single pint of Ruddles

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:25.740
 anymore because of this mad inflation that's gone on,

00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:27.100
 this just pisses me off more.

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:28.860
 - That's devastating, yeah.

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:30.060
 Poundland is very interesting.

00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:33.500
 The idea of setting up a shop where everything was a pound,

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:36.180
 and it did have to buckle because things did go up,

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:38.220
 so obviously things were more than a pound,

00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:40.580
 but just the very idea of setting up a shop

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:42.020
 and going everything as a pound

00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:43.660
 is a pretty remarkable thing.

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:45.740
 - Yeah, because a lot of things are a pound.

00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:46.580
 - Right.

00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:47.740
 - That's the clever thing about it.

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:48.580
 - Yeah.

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:49.420
 - You're going, "Oh my God, everything's a pound."

00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:51.780
 You go, "Yeah, but I mean, they cost a pound."

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:53.740
 - Yeah, you're not selling iPads for a pound.

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:55.500
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:58.460
 - But Poundland was a bit of a Nepo store

00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:01.020
 because they were founded with a 50K loan

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:03.460
 from a guy called Stephen Smith's father,

00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:06.100
 who had, he had a cash and carry business,

00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:08.340
 and he gave his son a loan so that they could sell

00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:09.180
 this new company.

00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:10.540
 - A loan of one pound.

00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:13.940
 - But in fairness, the whole family had come

00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:16.060
 from a market stall background,

00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:19.020
 and the business idea for Poundland came

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:20.620
 because on their market stall,

00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:23.020
 they had a box where everything was 10p,

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:24.620
 and people would just go in and grab something

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:25.700
 and put their 10p in the thing.

00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:28.740
 They thought we could make this a big thing.

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:30.020
 And actually, I think in the UK,

00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:31.660
 there's quite a lot of companies,

00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:35.220
 especially supermarkets, that began in the markets.

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:36.060
 - Yeah.

00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:36.900
 - Didn't they?

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:38.780
 Tescos, Morrison's and Mark's and Spencer's

00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:40.980
 were all originally market stalls.

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:41.900
 - Right.

00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:44.460
 - There's a Poundland Museum as well.

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:45.340
 There's a Poundland Museum,

00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:48.540
 and even better than that, you can buy it if you want.

00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:50.820
 You can buy it for 4.25 million.

00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:54.780
 So Keith Smith, who set up Poundland with his son,

00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:56.980
 he went off to the Algarve after Steve Smith

00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:57.820
 was building this thing,

00:32:57.820 --> 00:32:59.340
 and he and his wife came back to England

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:00.180
 and bought a house.

00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:01.020
 I've got the name of it.

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:01.860
 - Lutstone Hall.

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:04.140
 - Lutstone Hall, and in Lutstone Hall,

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:07.700
 it has the Poundland Museum in one of the barns there.

00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:10.140
 And it's on the right move right now.

00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:12.420
 If you look at Cleverley in Shropshire,

00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:15.140
 you can take a look at Lutstone Hall.

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:17.340
 There isn't actually a shot of the Poundland Museum.

00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:19.260
 - But I feel like they're tricking the buyer

00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:21.180
 because it's not only a Poundland Museum,

00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:23.100
 it's also a Lutstone Hall Museum.

00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:25.380
 So you've got all these amazing bits of archeology

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:26.220
 that they've dug up,

00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:29.300
 sitting next to Poundland items, right?

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:31.180
 But they say you get the house,

00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:32.860
 which is unbelievably beautiful,

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:34.500
 but they're gonna take all of the stuff

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:36.980
 in the Poundland Museum and bring it to headquarters.

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:39.700
 So you actually don't get the Poundland Museum.

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:42.380
 - I bet if I've made them an offer,

00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:44.060
 and I'd said I'm buying it,

00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:45.620
 but I want the Poundland Museum,

00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:46.780
 they go, "Yeah, fine."

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:47.620
 Because it's still for sale.

00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:48.580
 It's been selling for a long time.

00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:50.100
 - Yeah, they've had to halve the price.

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:52.260
 - So if I'm saying to them, full asking price.

00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:53.300
 - Is it you and me on Zoopla,

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:55.540
 just constantly looking at this house?

00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:57.740
 - One other person interested, it says.

00:33:57.740 --> 00:34:00.140
 - It started at about 9.5 million, right?

00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:02.140
 Then it was down to 7.75.

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:03.820
 Not that I'm obsessed with white move.

00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:05.860
 Now, as you say, it's about 4.5 million,

00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:07.380
 and it's a really nice house.

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:08.900
 It's got one of those swimming pools

00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:11.020
 where you can put a dance floor over the top of it.

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:12.620
 - And they actually, they reduced the price

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:14.060
 over a Christmas period for a while,

00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:15.060
 thinking that that would be.

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:16.380
 - What is going on, Dad?

00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:17.340
 (audience laughing)

00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:19.420
 - I didn't know you were so into this.

00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:22.700
 But if you said I want all the pound land stuff,

00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:24.140
 they're not gonna say no.

00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:26.460
 It's really important to us that that goes to our head office.

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:28.260
 - Listen, if you wanna go halves, I am.

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:29.260
 (audience laughing)

00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:30.100
 - Yeah, right.

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:35.100
 - If you wanna go, let's readdress that balance.

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:36.220
 - Yeah, let's do it.

00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:40.100
 - Richard, would you give a TV show

00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:41.820
 to the concept of Poundland?

00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:43.740
 Would you think that's a good TV show?

00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:45.500
 - Would you think that's a good TV show to make?

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:46.860
 - Sorry, what are you talking about?

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:48.020
 (audience laughing)

00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:50.620
 I've got a format called PoundShop Wars,

00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:51.780
 which is all about rivalry

00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:54.140
 between different kinds of PoundShop.

00:34:54.140 --> 00:34:55.540
 - Okay, that's different to what you said.

00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:58.020
 When you walked, when you walked in the room,

00:34:58.020 --> 00:34:59.540
 which was, would you like a game show?

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:00.660
 And it's about Poundland.

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:01.740
 (laughing)

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:03.460
 - Sorry, because there was a real TV show

00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:04.780
 called PoundShop Wars.

00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:05.620
 - Wow. - Okay.

00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:07.220
 - And it sounds quite fun.

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:10.140
 So I'm just gonna give you a few episode pictures

00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:11.500
 and see what you think of it, Richard.

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:13.020
 - So someone's already made this.

00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:13.860
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:15.140
 - So I might not buy it from you, but go on.

00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:16.100
 (audience laughing)

00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:18.340
 - When Poundland reduces its prices,

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:22.860
 Pound World retaliates by launching the one-pound bra.

00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:24.540
 (audience laughing)

00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:26.500
 - Is that a weight thing or a price thing?

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:27.900
 - It's a weight, a price.

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:29.900
 (audience laughing)

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:31.420
 - Rival stores compete for the crown

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:35.060
 of best Halloween PoundShop in South Wales.

00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:36.820
 - No, I genuinely would like, I would watch that.

00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:37.660
 - Okay. - If I watched

00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:38.500
 the first two minutes of that,

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:40.980
 it was on channel five, I think I even saw it.

00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:41.820
 - Oh, I'm not sure.

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:43.860
 - Almost certainly with John Thompson doing the voiceover.

00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:45.300
 - Okay.

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:46.420
 - It does sound good.

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:49.500
 - Did they have any stuff about the 99p stores?

00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:50.580
 - No, absolutely not.

00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:51.420
 - No, really?

00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:52.260
 - No, that's good.

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:53.100
 - I love it.

00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:55.700
 It tells you everything you ever need to know about economics.

00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:56.980
 You do not need to go to university.

00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:59.340
 You need to know that whenever a 99p store

00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:01.100
 opens next to a pound store,

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:02.940
 it takes a lot of their business, right?

00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:03.780
 - Yeah.

00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:06.060
 - Poundland even bought the 99p stores

00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:10.260
 for 55 million pounds in 2015.

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:13.940
 But then there was also when the 99p stores came out,

00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:17.380
 then you started getting 97p stores.

00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:20.380
 And in Barking in Essex, there was the 99p store.

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:23.620
 And then on the same street opened a 97p store,

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:26.580
 which had an introductory 95p sale.

00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:30.420
 - That's good.

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:31.340
 - That's really good.

00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:32.660
 - Economics 101.

00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:33.700
 - Do you know who was the father,

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:35.220
 kind of the father of all of this stuff?

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:39.100
 So this is a guy called Frank Woolworth of Woolworth.

00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:41.460
 So he was the father of discount stores, basically.

00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:42.300
 - Where was he from?

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:43.780
 'Cause you get that in multiple countries now.

00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:45.500
 - Yes, he was American.

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:47.020
 Woolworth was a big brand in Britain as well

00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:49.580
 till it went bust, but he grew up in the States.

00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:53.620
 And there were already some budget stores in big cities.

00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:54.900
 And they were called Nickel and Dimes

00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:57.220
 'cause everything was either a nickel or a dime.

00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:58.860
 And he opened a thing called Woolworth's

00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:02.300
 great five cent store in Pennsylvania.

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:04.180
 And it became unbelievably successful.

00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:06.260
 As in he had about a thousand branches.

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:07.660
 No more, probably a couple of thousand

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:10.180
 all across the States, went international.

00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:13.620
 And he took the opportunity to go absolutely bananas

00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:14.460
 with the money.

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:18.180
 So he paid for the biggest building in New York to be built.

00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:20.820
 The tallest building in the world at that time

00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:23.180
 was the Woolworth building in New York.

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:24.620
 And he paid cash for it.

00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:27.620
 He didn't muck around with mortgages or anything.

00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:29.860
 He just said, "I'm building, I'm commissioning this."

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:32.940
 And then he became obsessed with Napoleon Bonaparte.

00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:34.820
 That was his thing.

00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:38.540
 So his private office, sort of 50 floors up here,

00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:41.620
 was an exact replica of Napoleon's private office

00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:43.220
 from his castle in France.

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:44.860
 He would walk around his private estate

00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:46.420
 in an old Napoleon uniform,

00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:49.140
 like a legitimate old Napoleon uniform.

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:51.900
 The gate of the estate is based on the Arc de Triomphe.

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:53.940
 He bought Napoleon's old bed.

00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:56.060
 There was an old slave bed that Napoleon had had.

00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:58.540
 And there are rumors that he believed he was Napoleon.

00:37:58.540 --> 00:37:59.380
 - Okay.

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:00.220
 - Towards the end.

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:01.820
 - And you were saying he wasn't?

00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:03.020
 - I'm saying he--

00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:04.820
 - What evidence do you have that he wasn't?

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:05.780
 Just out of interest.

00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:06.620
 - Do you know what?

00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:08.140
 He was also interested in time travel.

00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:10.260
 So that's a very good choice.

00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:13.540
 - He's here today.

00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:14.380
 - That's amazing.

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:17.220
 - Frank Woolworth, just one of the most eccentric,

00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:19.100
 effectively pound-trop owners, you know.

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:21.860
 - Do you know what is the biggest supermarket?

00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:26.500
 Fastest growing, let's say, grocery chain in the US today.

00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:27.820
 It's one you've heard of.

00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:29.300
 - Target, is that one in America?

00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:30.140
 - It's not Target.

00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:31.900
 It's one that's bigger in the UK.

00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:33.500
 And Europe, I should say.

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:34.340
 - Lidl.

00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:35.340
 - Lidl's very close.

00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:37.620
 - Aldi. - Aldi is correct.

00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:39.060
 And so they're starting to learn

00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:40.820
 about the Isle of Shame now.

00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:42.660
 - Oh, sorry.

00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:44.180
 I thought that was Britain.

00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:47.180
 (audience laughing)

00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:53.740
 - For anyone who doesn't know the Isle of Shame,

00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:55.740
 this is the middle Isle of Aldi

00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:58.940
 where they just put some absolutely crazy things in there.

00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:01.260
 Basically, they do something called Overstock

00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:04.940
 where if a company has a lot of ironing boards

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:05.980
 that they're trying to get rid of,

00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:08.260
 then Aldi will buy them all for really cheap

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:10.340
 and then sell them in their shops.

00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:12.540
 So America is starting to find this.

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:13.700
 And so if you go on the internet,

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:14.820
 you get lots of people asking

00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:18.220
 what's the weirdest thing you've ever found in the Isle of Shame.

00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:20.940
 So things include bucket hats for dogs,

00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:25.180
 a light for the inside of your toilet bowl.

00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:27.500
 - Okay, hang on.

00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:28.340
 Let's pause on that.

00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:29.780
 - Okay.

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:30.620
 - Yeah.

00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:31.460
 - So what's going on there?

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:32.700
 - I would give you 400,000 pound

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:34.380
 for 20% of this company.

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:37.860
 (audience laughing)

00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:39.580
 - If you want to go to the toilet in the night.

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:40.740
 - I think that's a brilliant idea.

00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:42.820
 - You might need something to aim at.

00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:43.820
 - What runway lights?

00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:44.660
 - In an airplane.

00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:45.500
 - Exactly.

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:46.580
 - You know the airports didn't used to have those.

00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:47.780
 - Then I can get rid of the guy

00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:50.380
 with the ping pong bats in my toilet.

00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:51.220
 - But hang on.

00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:53.460
 You don't want to turn on your main bathroom light?

00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:55.460
 - What if the main bathroom is right next to the bedroom

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:58.260
 and you don't want to wake up with your partner or whatever?

00:39:58.260 --> 00:39:59.860
 - That isn't you don't have a door.

00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:01.100
 (audience laughing)

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:03.700
 - Sorry, we don't have doors there, all right?

00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:05.540
 - If you get up to go to the toilet in the night,

00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:06.860
 do you turn all the lights on?

00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:09.140
 - I just feel my way to the bathroom.

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:10.540
 - That's really selfish if you do that.

00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:11.740
 - Hang on, no, I'm sorry.

00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:13.340
 (audience laughing)

00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:14.500
 I don't turn on the main light.

00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:15.940
 - I bet you flush as well, don't you?

00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:16.780
 - I do.

00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:17.620
 (audience laughing)

00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:18.980
 What I do is I get out of bed,

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:21.140
 I go right up to my wife's ear and I go,

00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:22.580
 "Where's the toilet again?"

00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:24.900
 (audience laughing)

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:27.020
 Hey, you would go into the toilet, it's a separate room.

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:27.860
 You turn the light on.

00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:28.820
 - I'm so sorry, what on earth are you using

00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:30.500
 your iPhone light for?

00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:32.220
 - That's very personal a question.

00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:33.460
 (audience laughing)

00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:35.780
 - You don't turn the light on at night.

00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:38.820
 - You guys are nuts, what are you talking about?

00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:41.060
 It's in a different room altogether.

00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:43.980
 - Oh, well, someone's doing your life for himself.

00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:44.820
 - Oh, but to me.

00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:49.580
 - Ew, I'm just going to the West Wing to have a wee.

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:51.100
 Fuck it, ow.

00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:52.540
 - Some of us are still on

00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:55.580
 the old trusty ceramic bowl under the bed.

00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:58.500
 (audience laughing)

00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:00.780
 - It's honestly like sitting next to Prince Andrew.

00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:04.300
 (audience laughing)

00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:05.300
 - All right, what else is there?

00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:06.140
 - What else is there?

00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:06.980
 - So that's a good, that's a good,

00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:08.700
 I think that's not an insane idea.

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:10.860
 - None of these, like people bought these things.

00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:12.100
 Dessert, hummus.

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:12.940
 - Dessert, hummus.

00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:14.060
 - Dessert, hummus.

00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:15.740
 It's made of chickpeas, but it's sweet.

00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:16.580
 - Oh, okay.

00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:17.900
 Are the red tights get pissed off

00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:20.820
 when they taste the difference?

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:22.660
 - And then one person on Reddit,

00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:23.940
 when they asked what's the weirdest thing

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:25.540
 you found in the Isle of Shame said,

00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:28.420
 "I work at Aldi, so my take is a bit different

00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:29.860
 "than the shopper, but the weirdest thing

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:31.420
 "I have found in the Isle of Shame

00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:33.460
 "is a turd lying on the ground."

00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:37.140
 (audience laughing)

00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:37.980
 - And that's what happens

00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:40.380
 when you don't turn the lights on, so take it back.

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:44.960
 (upbeat music)

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:50.060
 - It is time for our final fact of the show,

00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:51.700
 and that is my fact.

00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:54.180
 My fact this week is that not long

00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:57.820
 after he released his song "All By Myself",

00:41:57.820 --> 00:42:00.380
 the musician Eric Carman was taken to court

00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:02.060
 because as it turned out,

00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:05.220
 he did not write it "All By Myself".

00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:08.100
 We all know the song, it was in Bridget Jones' diary.

00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:11.160
 Celine Dion covered it, it's a massive tune,

00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:13.460
 and Eric Carman put it on his debut album,

00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:15.700
 and he decided to incorporate

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:18.460
 the second movement of a piece by Rachmaninov,

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:20.700
 and he thought, because in America,

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:21.860
 it was out of copyright,

00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:24.380
 that that would be the case globally, but it wasn't,

00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:27.180
 and so he had to give over 12%

00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:29.060
 of the royalties forever on,

00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:33.500
 and so Rachmaninov has a co-write credit on "All By Myself".

00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:34.340
 - Crazy.

00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:37.460
 I mean, it is in fairness, it is identical, isn't it?

00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:39.580
 - Yeah, and he wasn't trying to steal it,

00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:40.820
 it wasn't a plagiarism thing,

00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:42.300
 he thought it was out of copyright.

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:45.260
 - Yeah, he was a massive Rachmaninov fan, I think,

00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:47.060
 and when they asked him about it, he said,

00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:49.940
 "I thought it's a crime that there are some spectacular

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:51.820
 melodies in classical music

00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:54.740
 that the general public doesn't get exposed to."

00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:57.020
 But it turned out that the actual crime was plagiarism.

00:42:57.020 --> 00:43:00.020
 (audience laughing)

00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:03.380
 - The irony of the title, that "All By Myself",

00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:05.900
 and he didn't write it all by himself,

00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:10.180
 reminds me of the absolute classic case of Gary Portnoy.

00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:12.580
 - I grew up with him, yes.

00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:13.420
 Who's that?

00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:14.260
 - I know the name.

00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:15.380
 - You know Gary Portnoy?

00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:16.300
 You know Gary Portnoy?

00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:19.700
 He's the man who wrote "When Everybody Knows Your Name".

00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:22.660
 - Oh, cheers. - The theme tune to "Cheers".

00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:25.140
 Yeah, which one of the most famous songs in our culture,

00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:26.980
 but no one knows who wrote it was Gary Portnoy.

00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:28.260
 - Yes, that's great.

00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:29.100
 - There you go.

00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:29.940
 - That's really good.

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:31.260
 - James didn't know his name.

00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:33.780
 - I've heard the name before because I've watched every episode

00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:35.780
 about 20 times and it comes up, doesn't it?

00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:36.740
 - Gary Portnoy.

00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:38.140
 - Does this work when you're on quizzes,

00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:39.580
 if you just say, "Oh, I did know it"?

00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:40.540
 (audience laughing)

00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:42.300
 - Yeah, if you're honest.

00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:45.140
 - Yeah, there should be benefit of the doubt points

00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:46.380
 at the end of every round.

00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:47.300
 - Oh, I was gonna say that.

00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:48.580
 Well, if you were gonna say it,

00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:49.900
 then I'm gonna give you the points.

00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:51.140
 (audience laughing)

00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:52.820
 - I'm taking notes for "What's My Spoon",

00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:53.660
 don't worry guys.

00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:54.500
 (audience laughing)

00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:56.380
 So this is a really big thing in lots of songs.

00:43:56.380 --> 00:43:58.700
 There are songwriters who will get sued later on

00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:01.660
 because some similarity has been found.

00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:04.300
 So one of the most famous recent cases of that

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:07.100
 was the song "Blurred Lines", if anyone remembers that.

00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:08.420
 - Friend of the podcast.

00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:10.820
 - Right, T.I. for over Williams and--

00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:11.660
 - Robin Thickey.

00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:12.540
 - Robin Thickey.

00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:13.380
 (audience laughing)

00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:14.900
 They had to pay.

00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:16.300
 (audience laughing)

00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:19.780
 They had to pay $5 million of the proceeds of "Blurred Lines",

00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:22.020
 which I mean, I'm naive about how much

00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:24.300
 an individual hit earns you, clearly.

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:27.100
 They had to pay $5 million to Marvin Gaye's estate.

00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:31.660
 Not because of a particular melody or anything,

00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:34.300
 it was because of basically the feel of the song.

00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:35.140
 - The vibe.

00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:36.060
 - The vibe.

00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:37.780
 Like they had borrowed the vibe.

00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:39.460
 - To be fair, when you listen to it,

00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:41.300
 you can kind of see where they're coming from,

00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:43.220
 'cause it's like a kind of funky bass

00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:44.420
 and some cowbells and--

00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:47.140
 - Yeah, but I mean, that feels really harsh.

00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:47.980
 - I know.

00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:49.980
 - 'Cause they were going for a kind of old school funky hit.

00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:53.500
 - I think that one did feel like, that's an odd one.

00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:56.340
 'Cause there's very obvious ones where absolutely is the case.

00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:57.180
 - Completely.

00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:58.260
 - There was one that I read about, which was,

00:44:58.260 --> 00:44:59.140
 I don't know if you all remember,

00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:01.980
 but Louise Redknapp had a song a long time ago

00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:03.260
 called "Naked".

00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:06.340
 The lyrics are, I could feel your eyes all over my body,

00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:08.300
 I can read the signs, they're sexual,

00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:10.540
 I can read your mind, I can see you want me.

00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:13.300
 And basically, someone effectively ripped

00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:18.100
 the entire melody and the bounce of the tempo of the song,

00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:20.660
 and they sued them, and so the co-writers of "Naked"

00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:22.740
 by Louise Redknapp are now the co-writers

00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:25.180
 of "Pepper's Party Time" from "Pepper Pig",

00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:28.860
 who sang a song about jumping in muddy puddles.

00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:30.140
 - Yeah, and again, it does sound,

00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:31.580
 if you listen to the both, it is-

00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:34.180
 - It's pretty much for much, lyrically as well, yeah.

00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:36.620
 (audience laughing)

00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:38.940
 - I was listening to one, "Viva La Vida" by Coldplay,

00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:41.380
 which I love, that's a Roman cavalry choirs

00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:42.460
 are singing all that kind of stuff.

00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:44.620
 There's a song by Joe Sattriani called "If I Could Fly",

00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:45.900
 and I was listening to the first minute of that,

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:47.180
 I thought, "This is nothing like it."

00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:48.020
 And then it gets to a bit,

00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:50.540
 you go, "Oh, that is exactly like that song."

00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:51.580
 So, but that's called "If I Could Fly",

00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:53.660
 and I do a very brief sidebar,

00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:55.420
 because instead of putting in "If I Could Fly",

00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:56.540
 I put in "I Wish I Could Fly",

00:45:56.540 --> 00:45:59.260
 which is the Keith Harris and Orville song,

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:00.180
 if anyone remembers that,

00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:02.620
 which is "I Wish I Could Fly" right up to the sky,

00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:04.500
 but I can't, Keith says, "You can."

00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:05.780
 It's called Orville's song,

00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:07.300
 and so I Googled Orville's song.

00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:09.900
 I originally wrote Orville's dong,

00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:10.740
 but,

00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:13.060
 (audience laughing)

00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:15.620
 fortunately, it said, "Do you mean Orville's song?"

00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:18.700
 But, so, a lot of people know,

00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:20.900
 a lot of people know the first verse of Orville's song.

00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:22.460
 The second verse, I think,

00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:24.300
 might be the bleakest thing

00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:27.980
 ever written in any medium, ever.

00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:29.260
 So, the first verse is, you know,

00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:30.940
 you have sort of a roughy no ear going,

00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:32.540
 "I wish I could fly right up to the sky,

00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:36.460
 "but I can't, Keith, you can, Orville, I can't.

00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:38.740
 "I wish I could see what folks see in me,

00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:43.180
 "but I can't, Keith, you can, Orville, I can't."

00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:45.300
 Second verse.

00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:49.420
 So, Orville, "I wish that I had a mom and a dad,

00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:51.180
 "but I don't.

00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:54.300
 "Keith, you don't, Orville, I don't."

00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:56.820
 (audience laughing)

00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:57.660
 And here we go.

00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:00.140
 Back to Orville.

00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:04.460
 "I'd like to pretend my sadness will end,

00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:05.300
 "but it won't.

00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:06.740
 (audience laughing)

00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:10.620
 "Keith, it will, Orville, it won't."

00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:13.060
 (audience laughing)

00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:14.500
 And that was number four.

00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:16.500
 That got to, that was like a big hit.

00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:17.340
 - Wow.

00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:19.620
 - I mean, that's quite something, isn't it?

00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:20.460
 - It's quite something.

00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:23.380
 - Yeah, "I'd like to pretend that my sadness will end."

00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:25.060
 I mean, that's like Iris Murdoch.

00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:26.020
 - Good Lord.

00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:28.460
 - They're the only people who've ever been allowed

00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:30.380
 to confer on Pointless Celebrities,

00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:31.580
 Keith Harris and Orville.

00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:32.420
 (audience laughing)

00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:33.260
 Very nice.

00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:34.100
 They came on together, we were like,

00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:35.220
 "Yeah, but this is fine."

00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:36.700
 (audience laughing)

00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:38.460
 None of us saw a problem with that.

00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:39.460
 (audience laughing)

00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:40.660
 - How did they do?

00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:41.620
 - They did great, actually,

00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:43.540
 'cause they were up against Tommy Cannon and Bobby Ball,

00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:46.260
 who scored 600 points in the first round.

00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:47.100
 - Wow.

00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:48.940
 - Which to this day is a Pointless Celebrities record.

00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:49.860
 - Wow.

00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:51.220
 - Taylor Swift.

00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:52.260
 - Oh, yeah.

00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:53.100
 - Singer.

00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:56.260
 So she has a song called "Look What You Made Me Do,"

00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:57.620
 which is a great song.

00:47:57.620 --> 00:47:59.140
 It's an absolute banger,

00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:01.820
 but it has a single cadence,

00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:04.100
 which was pretty much the same as one used in

00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:06.460
 Wright said, "Friends, I'm too sexy."

00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:07.300
 - Ah.

00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:09.460
 - Which was a really bad hit.

00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:10.900
 Like it was great, but it was sexy.

00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:11.740
 - I'm too sexy.

00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:12.740
 - Come on, mate.

00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:14.220
 - Okay, all right.

00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:15.500
 - I mean, it's no deeply dippy,

00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:16.340
 but it's not bad.

00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:18.260
 (audience laughing)

00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:20.660
 But basically, the writers of Wright said Fred,

00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:22.020
 or Wright said Fred themselves, I suppose,

00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:24.300
 have now got a credit on "Look What You Made Me Do,"

00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:25.780
 'cause their cadence ended up in it.

00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:27.060
 And this is a really common thing.

00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:29.780
 Like if a big star has a hit coming up,

00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:31.380
 or a song coming up for release,

00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:33.740
 like they'll have people check over it and they'll say,

00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:35.460
 "It's quite similar to this existing thing.

00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:37.180
 "Do you want to change a few notes?"

00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:40.140
 So people actively make the songs arguably worse,

00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:42.180
 'cause they'll say, "I'll just change these songs

00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:43.780
 "so it's not like, I don't know,

00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:45.740
 "yesterday," or whatever it is, you know.

00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:47.380
 - 'Cause there's only so many notes.

00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:48.780
 - I feel like it's all fine.

00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:50.260
 I feel like it's all fine to do.

00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:51.100
 - Do you?

00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:51.940
 - A lot of them.

00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:52.780
 - Thank you, your honor.

00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:53.780
 (audience laughing)

00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:55.820
 - No, but it's an interesting point because

00:48:55.820 --> 00:48:57.260
 the line that often gets said

00:48:57.260 --> 00:49:00.300
 from the old generation of rock stars, John Lennon period,

00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:01.660
 they would say, "Steal from the best,"

00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:03.100
 and they did sometimes get busted,

00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:04.380
 but if you look at the modern--

00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:05.780
 - And busted are the best.

00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:06.620
 - Yeah.

00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:07.860
 (audience laughing)

00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:09.980
 And the modern crop, you've got Olivia Rodrigo,

00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:12.940
 who was sued multiple times for her debut album

00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:16.380
 by various people, but the old crop, Elvis Costello,

00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:18.500
 said, "No, go for it, this is great."

00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:20.500
 The strokes with their biggest hits,

00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:22.260
 that was a Tom Petty song,

00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:23.980
 almost literally ripped--

00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:25.420
 - Last night by the strokes.

00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:27.020
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:49:27.020 --> 00:49:28.860
 Did Petty, I don't think he ended up--

00:49:28.860 --> 00:49:29.700
 - I think he was called,

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:31.500
 I think they came to an arrangement.

00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:32.340
 - Oh, okay.

00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:33.180
 - He was quite called about it.

00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:34.020
 - Yeah.

00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:35.300
 - So he wasn't, that's nice, he wasn't Petty.

00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:36.300
 Sorry, just to, like--

00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:37.660
 (audience laughing)

00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:41.100
 - Phil Manzanero, who was in Roxy Music,

00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:43.860
 every now and again, like he'd be sent a royalty check

00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:45.260
 for like 1.5 million pound,

00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:46.460
 and every time you'd have to go,

00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:48.340
 "Sorry, this is Ray Manzorak from The Doors."

00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:50.620
 This happens every now and again, so he sends it back,

00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:53.860
 then he gets a royalty check for 1.5 million dollars,

00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:55.420
 goes, "Sorry, this is Ray Manzorak."

00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:57.260
 They said, "Oh no, someone took a riff

00:49:57.260 --> 00:49:58.980
 "you did from a 1970s album,

00:49:58.980 --> 00:50:01.860
 "and it's on the new Kanye and Jay-Z album."

00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:03.420
 And so it was his money,

00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:05.620
 and he had just one of their kind of scouts,

00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:07.700
 found an old record, thought this is an amazing riff,

00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:09.860
 found out who'd done it, sent him the money.

00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:10.700
 - Wow.

00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:12.100
 - Yeah, it's worth having, isn't it?

00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:13.540
 - Yeah, that's great.

00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:17.300
 I found a really weird moment in pop history,

00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:20.700
 so Blame It On The Boogie was written by Michael Jackson,

00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:22.980
 a very different Michael Jackson,

00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:24.260
 who was also a singer,

00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:26.860
 who would trade under the name Mick Jackson,

00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:29.940
 but then it got taken to America via his people,

00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:31.660
 and it was played to a bunch of different people.

00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:34.660
 One of the people who heard it was the Jackson Five.

00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:36.100
 They recorded their own version,

00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:37.740
 and they released it in America.

00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:39.940
 Meanwhile, Mick Jackson is getting to release

00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:41.980
 his own version in England,

00:50:41.980 --> 00:50:45.260
 and no one knows who is who, because it's the same name.

00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:49.300
 BBC Radio One would only play the Jackson Five version,

00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:52.580
 whereas Capitol Radio would only play the Mick Jackson version,

00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:54.140
 and they were battling it out in the charts,

00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:56.380
 with people being confused about who is who.

00:50:56.380 --> 00:50:57.220
 - That's cool.

00:50:57.220 --> 00:50:59.580
 - It's just the most random name connection, yeah,

00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:00.420
 that you could get,

00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:02.780
 and he so happened to be an artist in his own right.

00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:03.620
 - Very cool.

00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:05.500
 All my stuff's about Rachmaninoff.

00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:08.380
 - Oh, let's hear about Rachmaninoff.

00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:09.220
 - He...

00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:10.180
 - Who did he rip off?

00:51:10.180 --> 00:51:11.020
 Doido.

00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:13.620
 (laughing)

00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:18.620
 - His first symphony, he played it to Rimsky-Korsakov.

00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:20.420
 He, like, went to the rehearsals,

00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:22.740
 and Rimsky-Korsakov said this,

00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:26.100
 "I do not find this music at all agreeable."

00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:28.260
 I was gonna translate it, this is shit,

00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:30.140
 but it was basically that's what he said.

00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:31.700
 Rachmaninoff suddenly thought,

00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:33.940
 oh my God, this isn't very good,

00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:35.100
 but he couldn't call it off,

00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:36.940
 so he spent the whole of the first symphony

00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:39.260
 hiding in a staircase backstage.

00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:40.580
 - Yeah, but then, like--

00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:41.420
 - Was it a success?

00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:43.340
 - Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:44.860
 It happened once.

00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:46.820
 The one reviewer wrote that,

00:51:46.820 --> 00:51:48.940
 "If the devil had written a symphony

00:51:48.940 --> 00:51:50.940
 "based on the 10 plagues of Egypt,

00:51:50.940 --> 00:51:52.860
 "and it was like Mr. Rachmaninoff's,

00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:54.860
 "then he would have fulfilled his task brilliantly

00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:57.180
 "and would delight the inhabitants of hell."

00:51:57.180 --> 00:52:00.020
 Three stars.

00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:01.660
 (laughing)

00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:03.780
 And Rachmaninoff refused to let anyone

00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:05.420
 perform it again in his lifetime,

00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:06.780
 and when he left Rush,

00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:08.860
 'cause he fled Rush and went to America afterwards,

00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:11.500
 and when he did that, he left his manuscript behind.

00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:13.540
 He just didn't want anything to do with it.

00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:14.460
 - Right. - Boy.

00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:15.300
 - Yeah.

00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:17.980
 - Was that the one that was used in All By Myself?

00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:18.820
 No, different one.

00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:19.660
 - No, no, no, no.

00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:22.460
 The one that All By Myself is his second symphony,

00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:23.940
 which is an absolute classic,

00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:26.700
 and which is regularly voted on Classic FM,

00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:28.540
 you know, our favorite symphony.

00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:30.220
 - But is that because most people listening are going,

00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:31.500
 oh, that's the Celine Dion song?

00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:33.980
 - Generally it is, I think it is, yeah.

00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:36.540
 Rachmaninoff, massive hands.

00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:37.740
 - Is that so?

00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:40.100
 - Yes, he can go 12 notes or something.

00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:41.140
 - He could do 12 notes,

00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:43.340
 but he could play a five note chord.

00:52:43.340 --> 00:52:44.460
 So it's not just reaching,

00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:45.500
 he could also play the first note.

00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:46.780
 - If he could play a chord.

00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:48.780
 - Yeah, he could play the first one,

00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:50.580
 and then the second one is 12 notes away,

00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:52.740
 and he could also play the three in between.

00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:55.460
 So that means your hand has to be even longer than the...

00:52:55.460 --> 00:52:56.940
 - But surely he's impossible to play then

00:52:56.940 --> 00:52:58.460
 for normal pianists with little fingers.

00:52:58.460 --> 00:53:00.900
 - Actually, I think that is a problem that,

00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:02.380
 like, people with smaller hands

00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:03.780
 find it difficult to play Rachmaninoff,

00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:06.060
 and also female pianists find it difficult

00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:07.540
 to play Rachmaninoff 'cause they, on average,

00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:08.380
 have smaller hands.

00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:09.220
 - Right. - Yeah.

00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:10.700
 - It's weird because this is, Richard,

00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:12.700
 you don't know the full history of our show,

00:53:12.700 --> 00:53:13.900
 but this is probably the third.

00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:15.140
 - I know the full history of your show.

00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:16.540
 - Okay, okay.

00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:19.300
 Then, as you will very well be aware of,

00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:21.700
 this is the third historical figure I found

00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:23.420
 who has massive hands.

00:53:23.420 --> 00:53:26.260
 George Eliot, the author.

00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:28.700
 Stonewall Jackson, the Confederate general.

00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:30.860
 He was convinced he had one giant arm,

00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:33.100
 so he used to go into battle on horse

00:53:33.100 --> 00:53:35.060
 with his arm in the air so he could distribute

00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:36.940
 all the blood that that was hogging

00:53:36.940 --> 00:53:38.620
 to the rest of his body.

00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:39.580
 This is now the third.

00:53:39.580 --> 00:53:41.540
 Rachmaninoff is in big hand territory,

00:53:41.540 --> 00:53:43.660
 big hand or not, the quiz.

00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:44.980
 - I got it, I got it.

00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:46.500
 They say that about Vladimir Putin.

00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:48.340
 Vladimir Putin, when he walks, you see,

00:53:48.340 --> 00:53:51.580
 he swings his left arm and he doesn't swing his right arm,

00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:54.060
 so his right arm stays absolutely by his side.

00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:56.620
 And for ages, people say that he's had a stroke,

00:53:56.620 --> 00:53:59.100
 something has happened with Vladimir Putin.

00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:01.700
 But you talk to anyone with any kind of knowledge of spying,

00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:05.220
 they go, no, that's KGB, 'cause that's where your gun is.

00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:06.900
 So you would never, you wouldn't be kind of doing that.

00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:08.220
 Always have your hand when it's your gun.

00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:09.220
 - No, fake arm, fake arm.

00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:10.620
 - No, no, it's real.

00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:14.900
 - No, shush, right hand is like holding the pistol.

00:54:14.900 --> 00:54:17.140
 And then you got the fake arm, and that happens.

00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:18.540
 - I'm with Andy, you see this all the time.

00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:20.340
 There's photos.

00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:22.420
 - But I don't think Putin has a fake arm,

00:54:22.420 --> 00:54:23.620
 that's what I'm saying.

00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:26.020
 - Well, agreed to disagree, but.

00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:29.780
 - I know he listens, so he probably can let us know.

00:54:29.780 --> 00:54:32.500
 - Guys, I was listening to the show.

00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:34.660
 I won't do the voice.

00:54:34.660 --> 00:54:36.340
 - That would be offensive, yeah.

00:54:36.340 --> 00:54:37.180
 - I think he's all right.

00:54:37.180 --> 00:54:40.500
 - Oh, I don't want to offend Putin, oh my goodness.

00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:43.300
 After all the good things he's done, no.

00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:45.700
 - We do need to wrap up, but you see photos now

00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:48.020
 where all the security detail that are walking around,

00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:50.820
 major prominent politicians and leaders,

00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:53.140
 have their hands just stuck in a position,

00:54:53.140 --> 00:54:55.620
 and it's because they're wearing underneath their jacket,

00:54:55.620 --> 00:54:58.900
 fake arms, while they hold a little gun.

00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:00.660
 - This is genuinely true.

00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:03.340
 - And it brings us back to Keith Harris, with Orville.

00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:04.180
 - He had a fake arm.

00:55:04.180 --> 00:55:05.780
 - Of course he did, because he's got one hand up,

00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:09.300
 Orville's, you know Orville wasn't real, right?

00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:10.140
 - Right.

00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:13.860
 - Yeah, you know it was Keith who wasn't able to pretend

00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:15.580
 that his sadness was going to end.

00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:16.420
 You know that, don't you?

00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:19.820
 - Are you saying that he was holding a gun inside or was?

00:55:19.820 --> 00:55:20.660
 - At all times.

00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:22.540
 - Was Orville working under duress?

00:55:22.540 --> 00:55:25.940
 - Yeah, I'll go on pointless with you, absolutely.

00:55:25.940 --> 00:55:27.380
 - Yeah, I wish I could fly right up to the sky,

00:55:27.380 --> 00:55:28.660
 you fucking won't in a minute, mate.

00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:31.660
 (audience laughing)

00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:36.400
 (upbeat music)

00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:41.020
 - That is it, that is all of our facts.

00:55:41.020 --> 00:55:42.860

 An impossible fortune, huh?
