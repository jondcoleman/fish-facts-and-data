00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
 Hey clubfish members, how you doing? It is a compilation episode for you this week. All the

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,640
 offcuts from the main episode that didn't quite fit into the narrative shape of what we wanted to

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,280
 put out in the main episodes, but still awesome stuff and so we're really glad that we've got

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,720
 somewhere for you all to hear it. So before we get into today's episode, I should say that our

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,000
 first live show of the year is creeping up on us. It's going to be a festival in Belgium at the

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,240
 Nerdland festival. So it's going to be us four fishers on stage doing an entire live recording

7
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:38,000
 at one of the greatest festivals in the world and I say that really sincerely. I love going to it.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,120
 It is such a joyous occasion. Everywhere you go is just pockets of nerddom. It's really kid-friendly.

9
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,520
 It's really worth going to if you're able to. Event-wise it probably helps to speak the local

10
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,440
 languages, but they're often a bunch of English events like our event. So yeah, do check that out.

11
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,760
 It's called Nerdland. You'll find it online. You can find tickets through our website. And if you

12
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,880
 go to our website looking for those tickets, you'll also see a link to our first UK live show,

13
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:08,720
 which is going to be at the Crossed Wires Festival. I've been mentioning it at the end of every single

14
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,480
 episode. Come to our show. We're going to be doing a live recording. There's going to be a few extra

15
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:17,360
 fun bits going on. If you're near the area, please do come. So again, just head to our website and

16
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,960
 you'll find the links there. Alright, let's get on with the compilation. The only thing to say about

17
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,360
 it is you're going to notice sort of halfway through a conversation that happens where we're

18
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,920
 unsure who is right. I won't say anything ahead of it, but I just want you to know. Turns out we were

19
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,880
 both right. You'll see what I mean when you get to it. Anyway, here we go on with the compilation.

20
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:58,960
 You used to have to be able to fake cry as your job if you had a specific job in Paris

21
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,640
 in the 1820s. Oh, is this gettable? Is this like an official, like a mourner? What about tricketers?

22
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,520
 Like the people who were at the bottom of the guillotine watching people die?

23
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,960
 Oh, I didn't know that was a thing. Yeah, you like used to get women who were knitting. Oh,

24
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,400
 the knitters. Are we supposed to cry as well? They were quite cheerful about the whole thing,

25
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,960
 weren't they? Yeah, they were doing their knitting. That was their entertainment was the

26
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:26,320
 guillotine. 1820s. So it's a bit after the Napoleonic Wars. In Paris. Is that a clue? You know about

27
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,920
 these people, but we've never mentioned them before on the show. It's specifically the clacker,

28
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,680
 which we have never mentioned before. These are people who would be paid to go to the theatre

29
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,480
 and have a certain reaction. So if you went to see a play in Paris, a few dozen spots would be

30
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,400
 occupied by clacker. If it was a comedy, they'd be employed to laugh. They'd be employed to gasp,

31
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,880
 they'd be employed to sob. And you had different types of clackers. There was actually a clacker

32
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:56,720
 school that was set up by a guy called Monsieur Sautant. And you'd have the Ria, who were the

33
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,680
 loud laughers. And then you'd have the Pluchas, who were the cryers, who were women who were paid to

34
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,120
 turn up and cry hysterically. And then actually... So annoying sitting next to these people in the

35
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,960
 theatre. People got really annoyed. They used to do quite a lot of fights between audience members

36
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,960
 and clackers, especially because you also had the commissaires, who were a type of clacker,

37
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,280
 who memorized the better parts of the play to call their neighbour's attention to them.

38
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,800
 So I suppose that... That's like an English teacher. There's Shakespeare play.

39
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,520
 To be or not to be. Do you remember? Yeah, it's good, isn't it?

40
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,160
 Because that is the most annoying thing someone can do at the theatre.

41
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,680
 Poison stuff out, is it? It's like, repeatedly, or if you're at a concert and someone's humming

42
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,880
 along next to you, like a classical concert. Oh, right. Not like a Bruce Springsteen concert,

43
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,040
 and everyone's sitting in Bond in the USA, and Andy's going, "I'm trying to listen to Bruce!"

44
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:50,160
 I mean, I do. I do slightly. It's not about us, is it? It's about Bruce's song.

45
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,960
 20 years ago, I would have disagreed with you, Andy, but I'm totally on board now.

46
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:59,120
 Stop singing. Let the dude sing. It's Bruce. They leave gaps. Actually, this really pisses

47
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,320
 me off. If Bruce or anyone else is listening, it really annoys me when you go to a concert

48
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,480
 of someone you love, they're singing their big song, and they leave the big gap for the audience

49
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,400
 to sing it. And you're so excited about hearing them sing these words. "I don't want to hear

50
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,000
 a thousand people sing." You don't get that in, like, the importance of being honest,

51
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:23,200
 really. You can't see that. She's like, "Handbag!" Yeah. She said, though. "To be or..."

52
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:33,280
 Tears in general? Crocodile tears. Oh, yeah. Oh, they're fake tears, still.

53
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,360
 They're fake tears, exactly. And there was an ancient belief that crocodiles would

54
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,840
 cry while eating their prey, and that gave rise to this phrase, "crocodile tears" of

55
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,320
 if someone's crying that they don't mean it. You know, they're just pretending.

56
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:53,040
 And yet, it was tested by a couple of researchers a few years ago, and it seems to be true that

57
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,760
 crocodiles' tear ducts get a bit loosey-goosey when they're eating. Okay. And a researcher

58
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:03,760
 called Kent Vliet fed seven caimans specifically, so quite crocodilian creatures, because they

59
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:08,240
 eat on dry land, so it's a bit easier to observe them than an alligator underwater or crocodile

60
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:14,880
 underwater. Five out of the seven that were fed wept as they ate. So it is a real thing,

61
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,760
 and it might be to do with the way air is moving into their sinuses and getting mixed around,

62
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,000
 and their tear glands then dump a little fluid into their eye because of the chewing process.

63
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,560
 Oh, they could be feeling a bit guilty about it. They could. Because there was a previous study,

64
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,880
 wasn't there, like, 100 years ago, where a guy took a crocodile and rubbed onions in its eyes,

65
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,480
 and then no tears came out, and he's like, "Oh, look, they can't cry, so it can't be true."

66
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:44,000
 In fact, they just, they don't, well, they probably wasn't happy about it, but they're not that fussed

67
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,440
 about onions. That's a crazy experiment to do. To just prove a relatively minor saying,

68
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:57,040
 that's amazing. With that, I've been in an episode on Mythbusters, where they go, "Actually,

69
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:03,760
 do you know what? I'm good. I'm good with the onions." Adam savaged. Lovely. There's the sun

70
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:12,160
 for you. There's a sun headline. It's like the three of us love it, and then Tanner always destroys it.

71
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,920
 The thing is, like, the joke was a good okay joke, and then you two didn't laugh. You just said,

72
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:24,240
 because when you do it so much, it becomes something to just sit in awe of.

73
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,320
 I'm actually a clacker. I've been paid by dad to laugh at his jokes for 10 years.

74
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,640
 But not to laugh at yours.

75
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,240
 So, you mentioned the other Happy Birthday song, the main one. Happy Birthday to you.

76
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,560
 Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday, dear. In a certain name, happy birthday to you.

77
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,680
 I never knew the lyrics all the way to the end. It's like the National Anthem, you only know the

78
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:53,920
 first bit, don't you? That was written by Mildred J Hill and her sister, Patty, I think who we might

79
00:06:53,920 --> 00:07:00,080
 have mentioned before. But what I didn't know is that she was a scholar of African American music,

80
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:06,080
 and this was what she was most famous for in her day. She wrote a lot of articles about African

81
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:12,000
 American music and was so influential that Antonin Dvorak's New World Symphony was written

82
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,560
 having him read her articles on African American music, which is obviously a huge deal. That came

83
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,880
 out before she died. She died in 1916, but the Happy Birthday song didn't become well known until

84
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:30,640
 about 20 years after she died. So she went to her grave thinking, I'm going to be famous forever

85
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:35,200
 because I inspired the New World Symphony and because I wrote all this stuff on African American

86
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,840
 music. But actually, she wrote the most famous song in the world. Wow. Even better. What would you

87
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,680
 rather listen to? Really? Happy Birthday or Anton Dvorak's New World Symphony? I think it depends

88
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,920
 how long you have to listen to it for. If it's Desert Island Discs, I'll probably take the New

89
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,720
 World Symphony, because on day two, I think Happy Birthday is going to be starting to great.

90
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:59,680
 You're a Pokémon fan, James. Did you ever play the cards? A bit. So the cards, there used to be

91
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:05,760
 a card called the Happy Birthday Pikachu. And the Happy Birthday Pikachu is one of the only,

92
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:10,880
 there's about 10 banned Pokémon cards that are no longer in circulation that were taken out.

93
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,840
 Frank Azores, yes.

94
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:21,920
 And the reason for it is because it was a card that if it happened to be your birthday on the day

95
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:27,280
 that you were playing with this card, it had sort of double, it had a way more power to it,

96
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,760
 and it could make you defeat your opponent. So the issue was most people don't, most kids aren't

97
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:36,320
 bringing their passports with them. So everyone was just claiming it was their birthday in a game,

98
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,920
 and they realised this is a cheat. So it got banned as a result.

99
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:44,160
 Just get away with that. Their mates will go, "No, it's not. You had a birthday party three weeks

100
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:49,760
 ago. They're not stupid." Also, I can't, if things had to be banned in games because kids

101
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,880
 were cheating at them, then no game would be allowed. That's true. That's very true.

102
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,360
 Do you know what kind of birthday party features Muff and Huff?

103
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:05,840
 Okay, interesting. Muff and Huff. Muff and Huff. I actually can't think of any

104
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,160
 category of birthday party. What about horse's birthday party?

105
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,040
 That's a good, I should have just asked, "Can you think of a category of birthday party?"

106
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,520
 Because that is actually what this is, but there aren't that many.

107
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,640
 Category of birthday party.

108
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,560
 Yeah, it belongs to a specific religion.

109
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,480
 Oh, okay.

110
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,920
 Huff and Puff, did you say?

111
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,440
 You're not going to get it from Muff and Huff.

112
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,200
 Believe you me.

113
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,640
 Is that a Huff or Puff?

114
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,120
 It's not Harry Potter birthday party.

115
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,760
 It's a religion.

116
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,640
 It is.

117
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,440
 So, Hoover's Witness.

118
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,120
 You've picked the one religion that doesn't celebrate birthdays.

119
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,040
 That's why I was wondering if it was an alternative.

120
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,440
 Okay.

121
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,360
 Yeah. That was madly.

122
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:39,840
 Sorry.

123
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:39,920
 Sorry. Sorry.

124
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,800
 What like a bar mitzvah is after you're 13?

125
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,960
 Very good, very good bar mitzvah.

126
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,360
 But now I couldn't find any more to reference this, but in a book called Bar Mitzvah a History

127
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,960
 by this rabbi and historian, he said that since 1789, it was common to read the Maft here and the

128
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,840
 Haftaro, which are readings from the Torah and prophets books.

129
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,680
 And that was always shortened to Muff and Huff.

130
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,160
 So, you have a bit of Muff and Huff.

131
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:02,640
 Lovely.

132
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,160
 And they're religious readings.

133
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,280
 It's not as fun as it sounds.

134
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:11,760
 Have you guys heard this? 1905, there was an attempt to change officially the date of

135
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,960
 Thanksgiving in America from November 30th to another date altogether because of a birthday.

136
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,160
 Oh, no.

137
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,360
 I thought there was something, there was something about changing it.

138
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,600
 The shopkeepers all wanted to change it, because it was too close to Christmas.

139
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,400
 So, was it the 30th?

140
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,000
 I thought it was one of those slightly movable things.

141
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,320
 Oh, yeah.

142
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,760
 So, Thursday after...

143
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,760
 Sorry, specifically 1905.

144
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,160
 Oh, sorry.

145
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:32,960
 Yeah, yeah.

146
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,480
 It was the 30th of November it landed on.

147
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,000
 Was it that it came on the same day as Martin Luther King's birthday?

148
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,120
 It cuts.

149
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,200
 It's less sort of powerful.

150
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,640
 Mark Twain was turning 70 on that day.

151
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,360
 Really?

152
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,400
 And he was really worried.

153
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:46,960
 He was going to have a massive podcast.

154
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,160
 Enemy of the podcast.

155
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,800
 He was really worried.

156
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,560
 Now, there could be a possibility that this is done ironically,

157
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,240
 but I didn't read it anywhere that it was.

158
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,280
 He wanted a big birthday.

159
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:01,680
 He had 170 guests on the invitation and he was worried that all of them would stay home and

160
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,280
 not come out to the party because they were celebrating their Thanksgiving.

161
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:09,920
 And so, him and his editor basically approached Theodore Roosevelt,

162
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,040
 president at the time, and lobbied for him to move it,

163
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,320
 either just miss it that year or move it to another day that year.

164
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,520
 I know he's an enemy of the podcast, but he's still not doing this seriously.

165
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,160
 It doesn't feel like it can be, right?

166
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,520
 But they do have the letter that was sent that was handed to the president.

167
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,360
 You hear about Elon Musk having his hooks into the government.

168
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,280
 You don't realise that this is a very old tradition.

169
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,760
 People are saying, "Can you move Thanksgiving for me, please?"

170
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,440
 That's shocking.

171
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,120
 I'm sorry, guys.

172
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,440
 This year, we're not going to have Thanksgiving on the double date

173
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,840
 because Elon Musk wants to have a birthday party.

174
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,480
 Give it a year.

175
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,440
 I'll give it one year.

176
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,280
 Wow.

177
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,240
 There's no reason why planes need to be symmetrical.

178
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:46,960
 Okay.

179
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,560
 But if you've got a plane, fuselage, picture that.

180
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,400
 You put one wing on one side, where do you put the other wing?

181
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,200
 Okay, it does have to go on the other side.

182
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,320
 That's true, but it does.

183
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,680
 This is all sounding a bit Elon Musk.

184
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,120
 This is sounding a bit Doge, I'm afraid.

185
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,600
 Like, why do we need wings at all?

186
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,200
 It's political greatness gone mad.

187
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,320
 The wing doesn't have to be in the same place on the other side.

188
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,600
 And in fact, an asymmetrical plane is more aerodynamic.

189
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,600
 And there's this one guy who started saying this in the '50s and '60s,

190
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,000
 saying that basically, if you've got the wings both symmetrically aligned on the plane,

191
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,640
 that increases drag and it's much less fuel efficient

192
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,640
 than if you tilt them at a diagonal.

193
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,360
 So one is pointing forwards and one is pointing backwards.

194
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,960
 So that makes it more streamlined.

195
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,240
 And it actually flies just as well.

196
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:30,720
 This is called...

197
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,240
 There was one plane made eventually by this guy called R.T. Jones,

198
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,960
 who said for 30 years, this is a better way of doing it.

199
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,480
 And all other engineers just said, people don't like asymmetry.

200
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,600
 That's literally the only reason.

201
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,600
 It's like human beings don't want to look at a plane.

202
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,120
 This German one looks upsetting.

203
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,880
 Yeah, it's odd to see it.

204
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,760
 You don't want to get on it.

205
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,880
 He made one.

206
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,400
 It was called the Armors Dryden.

207
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,080
 It was a NASA aircraft.

208
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,360
 And all the pilots who flew it said it worked completely fine,

209
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,400
 couldn't fault it.

210
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,480
 The wing rotated to 60 degree angle.

211
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,080
 So very sharp angle.

212
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,720
 It's incredible.

213
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,160
 Imagine if he'd been wrong and spent 30 years saying,

214
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,360
 "We can do a nice thing about the plane."

215
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,960
 Then it took off and then immediately crashed.

216
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,040
 He would have felt so bad.

217
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,480
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, like we do it.

218
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,520
 Is that so cool that it worked?

219
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,560
 That does happen.

220
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,120
 Jesus.

221
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,200
 Do you guys know about the inflato plane?

222
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,160
 Sounds like...

223
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,120
 Sounds like what it is.

224
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,600
 Is it?

225
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,080
 Yeah.

226
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,960
 Blow up plane.

227
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,280
 A blow up plane is really exciting as an idea.

228
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,800
 I can't believe it still doesn't...

229
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,440
 Terrible news.

230
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,320
 Your plane's blown up.

231
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:24,880
 Good news.

232
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,960
 It's an inflato plane.

233
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,600
 So this was a good...

234
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,360
 It was called the Goodyear inflato plane.

235
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,840
 And the idea was that if you had soldiers

236
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,280
 who were stuck behind enemy line,

237
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,840
 you could drop a plane out of the sky

238
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,080
 and no one really noticed that you were doing that.

239
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,960
 And it could land.

240
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,360
 And all you would need to do is inflate it.

241
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,160
 Did it come with a pump?

242
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,120
 Or do you get a very, very tired mouth?

243
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,840
 How's that plane coming up?

244
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,880
 You need to squeeze the nipple.

245
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,400
 That will get the air in.

246
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,360
 It's pretty insane, isn't it?

247
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,080
 Wait, does it...

248
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,000
 So the door opens and you set...

249
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,880
 Is it like a bouncy castle?

250
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,400
 It's like a bouncy castle.

251
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,720
 And what you do is it doesn't actually have an engine,

252
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,240
 but you just have to pop it and it goes...

253
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:16,960
 On Japanese traffic lights, they're just a bit weird.

254
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,800
 A bit weirder than all other traffic lights, right?

255
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,920
 Because their green isn't normal green.

256
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,240
 And that was by government decree.

257
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,880
 So I think some of them have changed now.

258
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,320
 But basically, in 1973, the Japanese government decreed

259
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,160
 that the green light on traffic lights

260
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,800
 should be as close to blue as legally possible.

261
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,360
 Now, they've signed up to an international convention

262
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,960
 which says the green light has to be green.

263
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,160
 So this needs to be a global thing.

264
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,440
 So everyone knows green is green.

265
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,520
 But the problem the Japanese people had is that,

266
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,520
 for some reason, when they started putting traffic lights

267
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,200
 up at the start of the 20th century,

268
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,680
 they used their word "aui", which at the time

269
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,680
 referred to sort of span both green and blue

270
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,520
 in the color spectrum, like the Japanese language

271
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,080
 as a slightly different conception of green and blue.

272
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,240
 Now, it's mostly used for blue and green

273
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,240
 is referred to as "madori", but they've always

274
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,040
 called the green traffic light their word for blue.

275
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,400
 What's now blue? "aui".

276
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,160
 So they were like, this is really confusing

277
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,920
 because we refer to it as a blue light,

278
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,080
 even though it's green now, what do we do to resolve this?

279
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,920
 So the government just said, right, make it blue.

280
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,200
 Okay, we're not allowed to make it blue.

281
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,080
 Make it quite blue.

282
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,360
 The blue is possible kind of green.

283
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,520
 Because they're like, Japan is obviously,

284
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,240
 law-abiding nation.

285
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,800
 They wanted to adhere to the 1968 Vienna convention.

286
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,160
 Yeah.

287
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,000
 On road signs and signals, which,

288
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,280
 guess who hasn't signed that one?

289
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,840
 A few places didn't, US didn't for sure.

290
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,800
 The US didn't.

291
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,560
 Such a big country, they haven't signed up to the main.

292
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,880
 Yeah, that's why they're green is pink.

293
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,520
 Yes.

294
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,280
 Like, I don't think Canada did either.

295
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,200
 I really think, like, I remember reading about

296
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,440
 that convention and loads of countries went over

297
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,080
 and they all basically went to this convention and said,

298
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,600
 right, everyone has to do exactly the same

299
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,720
 as we do in our country.

300
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,320
 And they all thought that that's what was going to happen.

301
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:50,720
 That was so funny.

302
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,000
 And then they all got there and they went,

303
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,120
 no, we're not going to do that.

304
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,040
 And they eventually, most countries saw went,

305
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,800
 okay, we'll go for this kind of version.

306
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,320
 But like, place like Canada and America,

307
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,240
 when that was sticking with what we've got.

308
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:00,720
 Stomping.

309
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,000
 Stomping on bastards.

310
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,800
 That's very interesting.

311
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:08,000
 You know the amount of time that traffic lights are on amber?

312
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,080
 So they go red, red and amber, green, amber, red.

313
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,320
 And the, when it's red, you have to stop.

314
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,760
 But when there's some amber there, you're supposed to stop.

315
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,240
 But if it's dangerous, then you can carry on going.

316
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,680
 You either have to stop or go really fast.

317
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,920
 Is the practical, what happens?

318
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,720
 Yeah.

319
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,200
 But the amount of time that lights down amber has changed.

320
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,480
 And it's thanks to one Swedish guy who went to court.

321
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,040
 He got caught driving through a red light.

322
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,480
 And he said, no, it was amber.

323
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,640
 And they showed him the evidence.

324
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,720
 And he was like, well, this is what happened.

325
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,440
 I was turning left or right,

326
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,720
 whichever way it was in Sweden.

327
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,320
 But if it was England, it would be left.

328
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,120
 I was about to turn left and I could see it was amber.

329
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,120
 But I thought I wouldn't have time to stop.

330
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,400
 So I turned left.

331
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,960
 But in order to turn left, I had to slow down.

332
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,560
 And it didn't take that into account.

333
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,120
 Like the amount of time it's on amber,

334
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,360
 it's normally, if you're going straight on,

335
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,840
 and the amount of time that realistically you can stop.

336
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,480
 Right.

337
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,440
 But he was turning left.

338
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,800
 You have to slow down to turn.

339
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,160
 And he said, this wasn't fair.

340
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,080
 So I want my ticket sorting.

341
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:10,800
 And they did it.

342
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,640
 And they changed the amount of time.

343
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,400
 And now, legally, that's changed.

344
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,840
 I think that's changed throughout the EU now.

345
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,840
 Because he had time to slow down, but not time to stop.

346
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,080
 Yeah.

347
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,280
 He was like, he was going.

348
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,320
 He could see it was amber.

349
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,640
 He was like, it would be dangerous if I stopped.

350
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:22,800
 Yeah.

351
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,000
 So I'm going to have to keep going.

352
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,800
 But I need to turn left.

353
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,080
 So I do need to slow down.

354
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,440
 And he just caught the red light.

355
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,800
 And they said, no, you're done.

356
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,200
 He had a good lawyer as well.

357
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,440
 I'm sitting there going, bullshit.

358
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,680
 You, if you can slow down enough to turn, you can still.

359
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,880
 No, I believe everyone of it.

360
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,600
 I think that's great.

361
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:43,120
 You know how, when you sit in a room, just staring at the wall.

362
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,720
 Sitting in the car in the dark.

363
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,520
 You're in your dang cave.

364
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,080
 Yes.

365
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,040
 And a single shaft of light is falling across the room.

366
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,120
 Okay.

367
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,240
 There's only one window.

368
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,120
 And it's a sunny day.

369
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,400
 And you can see the dust moats in the air.

370
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,120
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

371
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:55,760
 Yeah, I like that.

372
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,400
 It's nice, isn't it?

373
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,120
 It's sunny.

374
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,280
 Well, there was a physicist, an Irish physicist,

375
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,600
 in the 19th century called John Tyndall, who said,

376
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,360
 I want to know what's going on here.

377
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,280
 And let's sort of study it.

378
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,400
 And he created special equipment to observe

379
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,400
 what that was in the air.

380
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,800
 So he reported that his breath didn't have any of that stuff in it.

381
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,200
 But air in the room did.

382
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:17,680
 Yeah.

383
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:17,920
 Right?

384
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:22,960
 So he created all this, you know, sort of air filters and stuff like that.

385
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,640
 And what he was gathering together was a big strut of evidence

386
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,200
 in support of germ theory of disease.

387
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,760
 So Lister, Joseph Lister was saying, I think infection

388
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,680
 spreads through the air in microbial form.

389
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,640
 And lots of other scientists piled in and said, no, it doesn't.

390
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,480
 You know, a lot of them believed in spontaneous generation

391
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,840
 that life arises from nowhere.

392
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,360
 So this guy, John Tyndall, was so angry

393
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,360
 at all these people criticizing germ theory

394
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,120
 that he spent seven years studying dust in the air

395
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,360
 and trying to grow microbes in it into a liquid broth.

396
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,120
 He did hundreds of experiments.

397
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,800
 I just think it's amazing, this guy.

398
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,360
 Because it turned out he was right.

399
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,640
 When did you say he was?

400
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,040
 Sorry?

401
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,920
 When was when was this?

402
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,920
 1870s, I think.

403
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,400
 OK.

404
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:06,560
 Yeah.

405
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,680
 Did he make a delicious soup?

406
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,200
 Is there a recipe book we can get?

407
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,880
 He traveled all the way to the Alps.

408
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,880
 He was trying to prove if air has no particles in it,

409
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,400
 you can't grow anything from that air.

410
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,880
 Nothing can be cultured if you're using completely empty,

411
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,960
 you know, sterilized air as it were.

412
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,680
 He went to the Alps with 50 flask of broth,

413
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,720
 science in the 19th century was just great.

414
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,360
 And they were boiled and sealed broth tubes, right?

415
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,880
 And they were like beef, mutton, turnip, cucumber,

416
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,080
 just different kinds of broth.

417
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,480
 And he would open them up and a bit of air gets in.

418
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,280
 And then you see if anything can be grown from that.

419
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,520
 If anything in the air reacts with anything in the broth,

420
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,280
 that would mean that, you know,

421
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,880
 approved sort of health-proof germ theory.

422
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,720
 Again, much like this guy who managed to get

423
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,160
 a trip to the Caribbean on the free.

424
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,600
 Like, why did he have to go to the Alps?

425
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,880
 Couldn't he just go outside?

426
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,600
 Because empty mountain alpine air.

427
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,160
 Yeah.

428
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,600
 So, I mean, what he thought was that the air

429
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,320
 would be a lot emptier there than in his home, for example.

430
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:58,640
 OK.

431
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,920
 So when he opened stuff in his home,

432
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,920
 where people have been breathing out bacteria all day,

433
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,800
 he could grow stuff very easily when he opens up some broth.

434
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,720
 But doesn't that prove germ theory?

435
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,640
 Why does he need to prove it in the empty alpine air?

436
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,920
 Because he's saying that when you open this broth in empty air,

437
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,120
 nothing gets in.

438
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,360
 And that proves the difference between full air and empty air.

439
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,040
 Sorry, he didn't want anything to grow.

440
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,840
 Exactly.

441
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,800
 John Tyndall.

442
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,720
 It's so interesting, because 10 years before,

443
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,840
 the exact same thing was done by Louis Pasteur,

444
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:29,040
 who basically was the person who did all the experiments

445
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,240
 with the broth in the Alps by Mont Blanc.

446
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,520
 Yeah, he was in a massive fight with a fellow French scientist

447
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,560
 who thought that things were spontaneously erupting

448
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,280
 within vats of food and so on.

449
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,640
 And he was saying, no, it was a ribby.

450
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,320
 Like, literally everything you've just said

451
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,320
 is the exact same story of Louis Pasteur.

452
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,160
 I wonder if one of you's got the wrong name.

453
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,840
 I feel like that's the case.

454
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,160
 And I don't know who.

455
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,760
 The broth part of it seems very unlikely that two people--

456
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,680
 Imagine the people living in that little village in the Alps.

457
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,320
 All of the scientists--

458
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,000
 Oh, not another bloody scientist.

459
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,680
 Because all of the 19th century scientists

460
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,840
 had to have some element of broth to get your grant,

461
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,560
 to get your funding.

462
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,400
 Because check this out, Andy.

463
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:08,800
 Oh, no.

464
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:13,280
 In 1864, in an ampy theater filled with Parisian elites,

465
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,600
 he stood and he had a single shaft of light come down

466
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,840
 so that they could see all the dust moats in the air

467
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,360
 for him to show that it was surrounding us at all times.

468
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,880
 Why did you wait for me to get to the end of my 10-minute long bit?

469
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,880
 You were just leafing through your notes looking concerned.

470
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,880
 Looking faintly live first.

471
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,080
 I know something you don't know.

472
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,800
 Look on your face.

473
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,240
 Well, that's not the same, though.

474
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,040
 They're doing simple--

475
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,480
 Did he bring the broth to the Alps?

476
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:38,880
 Yeah.

477
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,600
 Right.

478
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,080
 I think we need to go back and look along those.

479
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,440
 It sounds like they just didn't communicate

480
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,960
 very well in the 19th century.

481
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,640
 If they'd had social media, they could have taught--

482
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,680
 Yeah, he was doing it in French.

483
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,040
 It was a completely different field.

484
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:49,920
 Yeah.

485
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,160
 Yeah, Louis Pasteur.

486
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,600
 He's-- because he's the guy who--

487
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,400
 Yeah, Drone Theory.

488
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,280
 Drone Theory, yeah.

489
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

490
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,680
 I think I've never heard of this guy.

491
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,440
 Well, he was clearly a--

492
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,480
 Plagiarist.

493
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,200
 He just read about Pasteur.

494
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,480
 No one else in the UK has heard of this guy.

495
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,920
 I'm just going to do exactly the same thing.

496
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,640
 He'll disappear into obscurity.

497
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,400
 He was the only guy who spoke French.

498
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,280
 Who was Tyndall?

499
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,200
 Wasn't he-- he was one of the leading Protestant reformists.

500
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,400
 You're thinking of a different Tyndall.

501
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:26,880
 No, I know.

502
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:26,880
 I know.

503
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,160
 I was not saying Tyndall.

504
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,440
 Irish, John Tyndall, Irish.

505
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,360
 Was it not one who was a rugby player who married

506
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,640
 one of the Royal Family?

507
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,120
 Was it Tyndall?

508
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:33,760
 Yeah, Mike Tyndall.

509
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,160
 Yeah, yeah.

510
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:34,880
 Yeah, yeah.

511
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,600
 You're all related.

512
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,720
 OK, you know all the Tyndalls.

513
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,920
 So I don't want to question it, then.

514
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,400
 I don't know.

515
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,320
 Mike Tyndall's work on Jam Theory is unbelievably good.

516
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:47,440
 There's obviously ASMR, which is where we get very close

517
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,400
 to the microphones and we make little noises.

518
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:50,800
 Wake up!

519
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:55,040
 But that's very extremely popular, isn't it?

520
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,160
 Well, I feel like it's got less--

521
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,840
 maybe it's been replaced by this brown noise trend.

522
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,080
 I feel like it's become less trendy recently.

523
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,640
 Maybe.

524
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,440
 Yeah, I agree.

525
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,280
 I think it's less trendy than it used to be.

526
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,880
 Will you just hear about it less?

527
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,920
 I'm sorry to hear that.

528
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,240
 Anyway.

529
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,720
 [LAUGHTER]

530
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,680
 There is.

531
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,320
 There is.

532
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:12,800
 This thing.

533
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,520
 And he is desperately now on scrunching his paper

534
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,640
 that hasn't got his notes on it.

535
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,160
 That's good stuff on here.

536
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,640
 If you want, for example, this is a thing for people

537
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,160
 to listen to, if you want to lose weight.

538
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,720
 There's a sound you can listen to that helps people.

539
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,080
 In studies, it's helped people lose weight.

540
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,960
 They eat substantially less.

541
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,640
 OK, here's one thing, like white noise,

542
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,600
 because Dan said it stops the internal monologue.

543
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,040
 If your internal monologue is saying,

544
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,560
 "I could do with another pie,"

545
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,400
 then it might stop you from thinking it.

546
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,520
 Not bad, but no.

547
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,440
 Is it a-- are we looking for a tone of noise?

548
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,240
 Or is it like--

549
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:40,960
 A kind of thing.

550
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,760
 A kind of thing.

551
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,040
 So, you know, it's like you're listening to--

552
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:43,920
 Vuvuzela?

553
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,800
 Vuvuzela.

554
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,520
 Vuvuzela.

555
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:45,920
 That's it.

556
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,640
 Is it the exact opposite of the noise

557
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,400
 that an ice cream fan makes?

558
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,880
 So you can't hear the ice cream.

559
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,920
 It's the opposite of Green Sleeves.

560
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,720
 Yeah, that's right.

561
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,480
 [LAUGHTER]

562
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,840
 It's actually your own chewing.

563
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,960
 OK.

564
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,040
 If you play into people's ears, the sound,

565
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,400
 then supposedly it makes people feel the flavours

566
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,200
 more intensely of what they're eating as they eat it.

567
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,720
 So they feel fuller faster.

568
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,200
 Oh.

569
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,640
 Does that mean you feel fuller

570
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,400
 if you taste the flavours more?

571
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,160
 Maybe.

572
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:16,400
 Yeah.

573
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,520
 I can imagine that your brain--

574
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,240
 I can.

575
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:18,960
 Would feel so much more--

576
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,880
 I've had so much more stimulation there,

577
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,920
 I don't need any more.

578
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,240
 Like if you just scuff your food,

579
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,240
 you don't feel full straight away, do you?

580
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,760
 Yeah, you're not tasting the flavours.

581
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,640
 But I would have thought it might

582
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,560
 because people don't like the sound of people chewing.

583
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,360
 I would have thought that as well.

584
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,240
 It makes you feel ill hearing someone--

585
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:34,880
 Yeah.

586
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,160
 So next time you have a dinner party,

587
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,320
 if you haven't quite cooked enough food,

588
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,480
 just pop some music on and just have a loud chewing.

589
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:42,800
 Yeah.

590
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,240
 Yeah, I've been to a restaurant where they gave you some--

591
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,920
 I don't remember what it was now,

592
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,280
 but it was some seafood.

593
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,880
 And they gave you headphones

594
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,440
 and played you the sound of the sea while you were eating it.

595
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,080
 And sprayed sort of salt in your face.

596
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,280
 [LAUGHTER]

597
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:57,920
 That's really good.

598
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,320
 Really?

599
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,360
 Was it the Fat Dark or somewhere?

600
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

601
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,720
 And did they throw your life belt halfway through?

602
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,760
 She's going down!

603
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,880
 [LAUGHTER]

604
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,600
 I stood up on the table with my arms outstretched.

605
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,200
 My wife grabbed me around the waist.

606
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,320
 They take the restaurant door off its hinges.

607
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,200
 Your wife gets on.

608
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,520
 [LAUGHTER]

609
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,440
 That melty cheese that you can basically

610
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,400
 get in a big old vat with a squirty bit on the top

611
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,760
 and you press it and it just squirts

612
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,880
 all this disgusting goop on your nachos,

613
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,360
 that was invented by a guy called Frank Libertto.

614
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:36,240
 And he actually died in 2017.

615
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,640
 And the San Antonio Express noted that it was the day before

616
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,720
 National Nachos Day that he died,

617
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,000
 which is a bit sad, isn't it?

618
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,560
 It is sad.

619
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,200
 It is sad.

620
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,080
 Cut, but stupid not to hang on, isn't it?

621
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,440
 But I think he was like a lifetime member

622
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,200
 of the concession stand guild or something.

623
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,680
 [LAUGHTER]

624
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,680
 Like in America, they have a big association

625
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,080
 of fast food concession companies

626
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,560
 and he was like one of the big cheeses there.

627
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,760
 Right, there you go.

628
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,960
 Now we work out why you were telling us that whole thing.

629
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,160
 Oh, God, are you joking?

630
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,200
 I was like, thank God.

631
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,040
 An exit, an exit strategy.

632
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,840
 You know how many people are called Bambi?

633
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,480
 Well, a lot.

634
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,160
 You think a lot of people are called Bambi?

635
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,360
 Yeah, okay.

636
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,000
 Yeah.

637
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,440
 Just because there are loads of people in the world

638
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,240
 they need to expect quite a bit.

639
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,960
 I feel it's a very reality TV name that I will have seen.

640
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,200
 I feel like it's fewer than Dan thinks,

641
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,400
 but more than you think.

642
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,080
 I think there's probably someone in the middle, yeah?

643
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:32,880
 Yeah, yeah.

644
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,240
 Weirdly, I think you're right, Dan.

645
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,280
 So what do I think now?

646
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,000
 I don't know.

647
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,400
 No, just in the year after Bambi came out,

648
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,760
 that was the first year in American history

649
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,040
 where five Bambis were born.

650
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,600
 Oh.

651
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,520
 And it's a very, pretty old naming choice

652
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,400
 as you've seen Bambi.

653
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,240
 You know, it's a kind of, it's a nice name.

654
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:46,640
 But it's a--

655
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,680
 Why is it an old naming choice?

656
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,880
 Bambi's a great character, very lovable, who doesn't die.

657
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,880
 But Bambi goes through a lot, I'd say, along the way.

658
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,080
 No spoilers for once.

659
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,920
 Yeah, but that's okay.

660
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,280
 Don't get too attached to Bambi's mother,

661
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,560
 as all I'm saying.

662
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,680
 But this happens, obviously, with loads and loads of films.

663
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:05,280
 And so there was recently a new version of Cinderella out.

664
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:05,840
 Oh, yeah.

665
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,280
 There are now 100 women-ish in America

666
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:12,800
 who will be in their mid-70s who are all named Cinderella.

667
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,920
 Hmm.

668
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,720
 Okay.

669
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,040
 Yeah.

670
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,760
 Really?

671
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,160
 Yeah.

672
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,680
 That's a surprising name.

673
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,080
 Yeah.

674
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:18,880
 I don't mind it.

675
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,760
 I don't mind it at all.

676
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,960
 It's just interesting how--

677
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,280
 Cindy, you just go Cindy for short, won't you?

678
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,080
 I suppose you would.

679
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,280
 Do you remember the name Walter Plinge?

680
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,520
 Walter Plinge.

681
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,960
 I feel like I would.

682
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,160
 No, I don't think so.

683
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,960
 So we've mentioned the name Walter Plinge once before in 11 years,

684
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,520
 and I'm really disappointed you guys didn't recall it.

685
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,240
 I'm really annoyed.

686
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,160
 This is the British Alan Smithy.

687
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,200
 Oh.

688
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,480
 Oh, okay.

689
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,160
 And Alan Smithy is--

690
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,680
 It's a pseunonym that a person associated with a film

691
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,200
 could be a writer, director, actor

692
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,880
 who doesn't want to be associated with the film.

693
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,240
 So Smithy is the name.

694
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,000
 And that's what goes on the credits.

695
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,200
 It's directed by Alan Smithy.

696
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,560
 Actually, it was Martin Scorsese,

697
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,760
 but he's so embarrassed to have done the nutty Professor Five thing.

698
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,640
 He just takes his name off the credits, et cetera.

699
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,040
 Walter Plinge is the British version,

700
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,800
 but there's another version of it,

701
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,360
 which is an actor who is mentioned extensively in a play

702
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,800
 but doesn't turn up,

703
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,120
 but you don't want the audience to know that.

704
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:13,520
 Goddow?

705
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:18,880
 So starring Walter Plinge as Goddow would be a perfect example

706
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,480
 of, like, let's not reveal that Goddow doesn't spoiler alert.

707
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,600
 Turn up in Waiting for Goddow, you'd say, Walter Plinge.

708
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,440
 But now we've spoiled it.

709
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,440
 Yes, I'm afraid no one will be able to enjoy it,

710
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,680
 not that they ever really did Waiting for Goddow again.

711
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:36,400
 Have you guys heard of the music festival Rocklet?

712
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,400
 I love it.

713
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,400
 It's a rock and raclette festival in the Alps every year.

714
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,080
 You should explain what raclette is, actually,

715
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,840
 because I don't think I knew 10 years ago when it was.

716
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,040
 It's a sort of cheese thing, isn't it?

717
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,080
 I thought it was like a fondue.

718
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,960
 No, it's like, so they give you a big lump of cheese

719
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,680
 and they put some tea lights under it and then it melts

720
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,480
 and then you kind of scrape it off the cheese as it's melting

721
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,400
 and you can eat it with your pickles and stuff.

722
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,360
 It's like a cheese kebab.

723
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,200
 Sure, yeah, no, it is.

724
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,280
 Yeah, yeah, like one of those big elephant feet.

725
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,800
 A lot of pot areas of London,

726
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,600
 they don't have kebab shops with the elephant lanky in the window.

727
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,840
 They've just got a whack and grape fondue

728
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,080
 and a very big tea light underneath it.

729
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,240
 Yeah, that's really cool, rock and raclette.

730
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,720
 Rock and raclette, and this year's lineup,

731
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,840
 the genres include heavy shamanic doom,

732
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,880
 dark folk and post-Indie dream shoegaze rock,

733
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,320
 none of which I understand.

734
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:26,960
 Sounds great, though.

735
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,680
 But they're all Benz?

736
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,520
 Not that, they're all genres.

737
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,320
 They're all genres.

738
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,840
 They're all genres played by Benz.

739
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,720
 Yeah, brilliant.

740
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,760
 Yeah, that's great.

741
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,760
 You really would only go for the cheese, wouldn't you, Andrew?

742
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,800
 Yeah, I would.

743
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,960
 Lovely last date, I don't know what raclette is.

744
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,120
 Probably the most famous thing like that

745
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,800
 is these guys called Jim and, Jim and Jim, actually.

746
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,920
 There's two guys called Jim who had been twins

747
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,000
 and were separated at birth and adopted.

748
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,760
 And it turned out they both married someone called Linda.

749
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,280
 They both got divorced from Linda

750
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,280
 and remarried someone called Betty.

751
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,920
 One had named their firstborn child James Allen

752
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,560
 and the other one James Allen with two Ls.

753
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,840
 So almost the same.

754
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,000
 Each of them had a dog called Toy.

755
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,480
 They drove the same car, same color of car,

756
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,760
 went to the same beach for the holidays

757
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,480
 and had the same cigarettes and beer.

758
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:18,960
 What?

759
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,120
 Okay, and this was a thing that happened in the '70s

760
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,480
 and it was quite famous at the time.

761
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,560
 I think people might remember it from the newspapers.

762
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:28,160
 And I've checked some of the old newspaper archives

763
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,360
 and I saw an interview with them.

764
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,680
 And because this is all true,

765
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,840
 but obviously it was just a coincidence.

766
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,360
 And it's just the fact that if you've got

767
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,440
 300 million people in America,

768
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,680
 a lot of these things are going to show up eventually.

769
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,600
 Can I ask quickly, why are they both called Jim?

770
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,640
 Well, actually, yeah, that's a good point

771
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,760
 because they'd been adopted.

772
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,200
 Oh, okay.

773
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,280
 So when they got adopted, they were given new names.

774
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,960
 Okay, it wasn't like their mum,

775
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,480
 it wasn't like they were taken away from their mother

776
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,720
 because she said I'll call them Jim and Jim.

777
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,840
 That's a really good point.

778
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,480
 I apologize to anyone who was thinking

779
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,160
 that for the very start of that anecdote.

780
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,000
 I couldn't think about anything else.

781
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,280
 You was there.

782
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,240
 Yeah, same thing, same thing.

783
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,120
 Yeah, yeah.

784
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,360
 So anyway, these two gyms, I read an interview with them

785
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,160
 and it was amazing.

786
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,040
 They, when this came out, that this had happened,

787
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,640
 they became a little bit famous and what happened was

788
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,720
 a load of psychologists got hold of them

789
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,760
 and started testing them and they were tested.

790
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,480
 They said 10 hours a day for six days

791
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,160
 where they were put in separate cells.

792
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,280
 On what?

793
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,480
 What were they being tested on for people?

794
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,120
 Trying to see if they were psychically linked or something.

795
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,600
 So also rounds on like pop music, sports.

796
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,880
 It's so weird.

797
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,360
 They would have things testing their brainwaves

798
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,640
 and they'd sit them there for an hour

799
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,560
 with nothing happening and then someone would come in

800
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,200
 and go, "Jim!"

801
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,240
 And then they would see if the other person's

802
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,720
 brainwave spiked as well and stuff like that.

803
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,320
 And did it turn out they both spent the whole time

804
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,440
 going, "This is bullshit."

805
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,680
 And everyone was like, "Oh, well, they are psychic."

806
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,920
 Yeah, what came out was actually,

807
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,520
 there was lots of differences between them

808
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,200
 that had never come up in the newspapers

809
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,440
 because the newspapers only looked at the things

810
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,480
 that were all the same.

811
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,280
 Interesting.

812
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:08,640
 Although you say two brothers with the same name

813
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,200
 wouldn't happen.

814
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,000
 You know, John Nash of Beautiful Mind, Russell Crowe-Fame,

815
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,880
 who was the great mathematician, game theory mathematician,

816
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,200
 who was then played by Russell Crowe, more famously.

817
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,440
 He had a son-

818
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,760
 More famously than himself playing himself, you mean?

819
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,960
 Yeah, yeah, okay.

820
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,760
 He had a son called John with one woman

821
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,760
 and then he had another son with his wife,

822
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,960
 Alicia, a different woman.

823
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,840
 And this was when he was becoming schizophrenic

824
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,960
 and he was in an institution, I think at that point.

825
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,200
 And Alicia said, "I'm going to wait to name this child

826
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,280
 because I really want John to have an input."

827
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,480
 So she waited a year.

828
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,000
 This child had no name.

829
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,520
 He came out of the institution.

830
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,040
 She said, "I've wasted.

831
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,480
 What do you want to call your son?"

832
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,840
 What did he call him?

833
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,360
 John.

834
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,080
 "Gordon Bloody John."

835
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,760
 "John Nash, two sons, both called John."

836
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,360
 Gosh.

837
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,960
 "Brains doesn't get you everywhere, does it?"

838
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,080
 No, very cool.

839
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,160
 That's the, I mean, the George Foreman, of course, had,

840
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,840
 who's just died, hasn't he?

841
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,400
 Yes, he has.

842
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:02,880
 Very sad.

843
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,200
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

844
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,920
 He had six George's and a Georgeina,

845
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,560
 Georgeette.

846
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,280
 Yeah.

847
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,960
 As well as the toaster, of course.

848
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,600
 Yeah.

849
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,440
 Yeah, yeah, who he thought of in the sun.

850
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,200
 Though he was asked that in an interview,

851
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,840
 and he said, "Well, once you've been in a ring

852
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,760
 with Muhammad Ali, Sonny Liston,

853
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,880
 and all the other boxing greats,

854
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,240
 and taken punches to the head,

855
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,920
 you'd name all your kids the same name, too."

856
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:27,440
 There was a Scabra football club in the 1970s,

857
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,400
 had two players called Harry Dunn and Harry A Dunn.

858
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,440
 But the truth is they were both called Harry Dunn,

859
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,640
 and they added a fictitious middle initial to one of them

860
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,880
 to make sure that everyone knew who was--

861
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,240
 Did he not have a middle name?

862
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,960
 Was he one of a weird rarity with no middle names?

863
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,760
 Lots of people don't know middle names.

864
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,440
 Yeah, he didn't have a middle name.

865
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,080
 Okay, yeah.

866
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,360
 Did the other one,

867
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,640
 because they should have gone with the other one.

868
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,560
 The other one might have done,

869
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,080
 but he was really famous, the other one,

870
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,280
 so they couldn't change his name.

871
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,840
 So they brought in a new Harry Dunn who was a lot younger,

872
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,520
 and they said, "Well, we can't call you Harry Dunn,

873
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,720
 because there's already one."

874
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,080
 And he said, "Well, I don't have a middle name."

875
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,520
 And they said, "Oh, we'll just put the first letter

876
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,160
 we could think of."

877
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,600
 Oh, poor Lesser Harry.

878
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,440
 That's like the Lesser Andy Murray

879
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,520
 having to call himself Andrew Hunter Murray, isn't it?

880
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,080
 Because it's like everyone knows the other Andy Murray,

881
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,000
 so you've got to call yourself something else.

882
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,640
 Cut to the quick.

883
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,560
 Never messes.

884
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,840
 Not Lesser any more.

885
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,600
 Okay, I think you've overtaken him.

886
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,920
 Wow, thank you so much for that incredibly belated

887
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,880
 and half-hearted teller.

888
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,920
 That incredibly belated life.

889
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:31,200
 You guys are familiar with the Canadian artist, The Weekend?

890
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,400
 Yes, I thought of The Weekend.

891
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,840
 The Weekend dropped--

892
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,200
 He used to be called The Weekend.

893
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:37,520
 Yeah?

894
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,880
 But then he dropped the E,

895
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,880
 because there was already a Canadian band

896
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,600
 called The Weekend.

897
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,120
 Really?

898
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,400
 It became The Weekend.

899
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,720
 And we could never have had this running joke on the podcast.

900
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,440
 We could never--

901
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,960
 Weakened, weakened, never.

902
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,960
 The podcast would have been weakened without that.

903
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,400
 I actually have a pop culture fact.

904
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,160
 You know, Taylor--

905
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,520
 Swift.

906
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,880
 Did you look--

907
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,840
 She looked to her page.

908
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,920
 No, it's just a different Taylor.

909
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,240
 There's a guy called Taylor Lautner.

910
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:04,800
 Oh, yeah.

911
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,720
 Who is in Twilight.

912
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,560
 And he went out with Taylor Swift.

913
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,240
 So if they'd got married,

914
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,080
 they would have both been Taylor Lautner.

915
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,200
 But they didn't get married.

916
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,120
 He ended up getting married to a nurse

917
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,880
 who's now called Taylor Lautner.

918
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,600
 Who was called Taylor as well.

919
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,880
 She was also called Taylor.

920
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,200
 Yeah?

921
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,000
 He's got a type.

922
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,600
 He's got a type and it's Taylor.

923
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:23,840
 Wow.

924
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:28,400
 Was it Evelyn War, who was married to an Evelyn War?

925
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:28,720
 Yeah.

926
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,440
 Well, yeah, yeah.

927
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,960
 They called them Evelyn and Shevelyn.

928
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,440
 That's right.

929
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,240
 Yeah.

930
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:38,800
 Okay, that is it.

931
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,480
 That is all of our outtakes.

00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,080

 Okay, we'll be back again next time.

946
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,640
 With a Drop Us a Line,

947
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,560
 we will see you all then.

948
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,200
 Goodbye.

949
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,200
 Bye.

951
