WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.640
 Let's go and have a look at the hotel.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:16.280
 Hello, welcome back to Drop As A Line, the Drop As A Line segment of Clubfish where we

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.720
 talk about the things that you have been sending to us.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.160
 So first of all guys, we've had lots more feedback on the name Drop As A Line.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.160
 Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.160
 All good.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.160
 Mixed.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.480
 Ginger Hilderman says, "I like Drop As A Line as a name, so thank you Ginger."

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.920
 And all the rest will be negative.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.240
 A lot of people coming up with their own suggestions.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.240
 Great.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.240
 Charlie Tuff.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.240
 No, that's a terrible name.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.360
 I like it, I like it.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.080
 Charlie Tuff suggests Piscine Post.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.080
 Okay.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.080
 Oh dear.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.080
 That's not good.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.960
 It looks a bit like Piscine Post.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:51.960
 Yeah.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.960
 Just about swimming pools.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:53.960
 Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:54.960
 Yeah.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:55.960
 It's a bit confusing.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:56.960
 Yeah.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.520
 Jill and Cliff have written, "Given that this is Andy's baby, shouldn't it be Club Moss?"

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.040
 Because Club Moss is kind of good.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.040
 Yeah, that's quite good.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.040
 Yeah, that is good.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.040
 But it did take two people to think of it.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.720
 I don't know who did the heavy lifting Jill or Cliff.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.800
 So anyway, I wrote back to them and said, "Thank you for that suggestion."

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.720
 And they wrote back again, "Could also have Club Foot for Daddy."

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.760
 Stop encouraging them, Andy.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.520
 So, wait, how does that make sense to me?

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.520
 What, Big Foot?

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.840
 They could be using Club Foot and Big Foot, they do, please.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.120
 Well, no, they say in brackets, "As in Big Foot."

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.120
 So, Club Foot.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.120
 Oh, okay.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.360
 I mean, because there is a medical condition called the 12 Foot, which is...

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.360
 Well, I think that's what they're referring to.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.360
 I think that might be...

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.360
 Okay.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.360
 Well, I would argue that's misleading.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.440
 There's a single by Cossabian called Club Foot.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.360
 Maybe they were thinking you had to call 2000, I suppose it was a great song as well.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.360
 It is.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.360
 Yeah.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.480
 And they come up, "Don't you worry, you guys are great."

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.000
 And Canadian Club for Anna.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 I don't know why.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 Type of whiskey.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.440
 It's a kind of whiskey, you like it.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.440
 I've got James's.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.440
 I've sorted it.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.440
 Oh, that's good.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.920
 That's good, because Jill and Cliff say, "Can't think of one for James."

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:01.920
 What?

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.920
 What?

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:03.920
 I mean, how much do I talk about golf on this podcast?

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:04.920
 You're kidding.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.920
 Are you kidding?

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.920
 They don't say golf club?

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.480
 In general, you say, "Can't think of one for James."

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.480
 Oh, my God.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.480
 Sorry, Jill and Cliff.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.480
 You've undone all your good work.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.480
 Got Club Foot?

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.480
 But you're kidding me.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.480
 Yeah.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.800
 I think Club Moss, Club Foot, Canadian Club, and Golf Club.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.080
 Jill and Cliff have done most of the work there.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.080
 So thank you, guys.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.080
 Yeah, lovely work.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.080
 Thank you.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.080
 The King and Queen of Clubs.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.080
 Very nice.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.760
 We've had an email from New Zealand on the name.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.480
 That's the entire country.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.480
 Wow.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.480
 Just in the order.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.480
 Just in the club.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.480
 No, it's from Hayden Freeman.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.480
 So thank you, Hayden.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.480
 From Hamilton in New Zealand.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.600
 I don't know where Hamilton is.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.160
 Your new mailbag show.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.160
 Oh, yeah.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.160
 Thank you.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.160
 Should be called "Hook Us Up."

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.160
 Okay.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.320
 "Hook Us Up" with facts, and "Hook Us Up" as fish.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.480
 As fish get hooked up.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.160
 Sorry, what's the title?

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.160
 "Hook Us Up."

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.160
 "Hook Us Up."

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.840
 And that extra bit was just explaining the two versions of what it could be.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.840
 Very nice.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.840
 The subtitle, maybe.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.760
 I could put in quite a mark if you like.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.280
 The quiz you did a few weeks ago, James.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.280
 Oh, yeah.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.280
 Yeah.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.280
 What did we call it at the end?

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.280
 No, she thinks it's a quiz.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.280
 Very nice.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.280
 Oh, no.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.440
 There's a bit of debate on what we call that, actually.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.440
 Someone written in a suggestion.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.680
 Well, I lobbied very, yes, they have.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.960
 I lobbied very strongly for the Haar quiz, James Haar quiz.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:17.960
 Oh, yeah, that was good.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:18.960
 Yeah, well.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.120
 So, you could call James's quiz, "Harkinon."

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.120
 Oh, yeah.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.120
 Okay.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.120
 The quiz that tells the story.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.120
 That's actually not bad.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.120
 That's a genuine suggestion.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.120
 It's not bad.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.120
 I'm up for it.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.240
 You made it worse by the weird "Harkinon" instead of just saying "Harkinon."

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.760
 Well, isn't the word "harping" on?

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.400
 He was harping on about that.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.400
 Yeah.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.400
 Yeah.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.400
 Well, there's also...

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.400
 "Harkins" is his name.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.400
 So, that's what he's done.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.400
 It'd be weird to call it "Harkinon."

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.400
 Yeah.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.800
 There's a Finnish motor racing driver called Mika Harkinon.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.800
 Oh, yeah.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.800
 Mika Harkinon.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.800
 Oh, yeah.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:49.800
 Put on his name.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.800
 Yeah.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:51.800
 Join his song, "Harkinon."

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:52.800
 It's Mika Harkinon.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.800
 Yeah.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.800
 It's a big one.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.800
 Okay.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.800
 Well, work in progress.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:57.800
 Work in progress, yeah, yeah.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.800
 Cool.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.240
 What about with "Hark" quiz, if it was an exclamation mark in the middle?

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.800
 So, it's like "Hark" quiz, like in the Bible.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.520
 Well, I think for Christmas, we'll have to do that.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.520
 The James Hark quiz.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.520
 Yes.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.120
 But "Hark" doesn't have to be only Christmas.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.880
 "Hark" means the same thing all year round.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.080
 It's just less often heard outside of a Christmas class.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.080
 It's less often or literally never heard outside the line, "Hark, how an angel sings."

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.080
 How do you "Hark" at this point?

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.080
 Oh, my God.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.320
 Because I want to say something.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.120
 Anna used to work as a town crier, didn't she?

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.840
 "Oh, really?"

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.520
 We have an email from Ian Fox, which is good, because Ian Fox is also one of the very rare

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.440
 people who's posted something physical to the office.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.440
 Oh.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.440
 Okay.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.520
 So Ian sent a fact about Roger Bannister, but that's not the main element, so I'm actually

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.520
 going to skip past that.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.160
 Well, at least you haven't mentioned it.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.520
 Left everyone hanging, haunting wall.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.520
 It's a related fact.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.520
 It's not actually about Roger.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.640
 Anyway, look, the point is, Ian Fox then goes on, "Thanks for all the podcasts.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:01.760
 By the way, it took so many years for me to send you my unused penis good, because COVID

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.200
 meant it took me so long to get back to my parents' house."

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.000
 And Anna, can you just reach over and grab the thing that's over here?

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.640
 Can I ask, he says it's an unused penis guard, but actually it's been left unattended in

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.440
 his parents' house for a number of years.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.440
 That's a good point.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.440
 During COVID as well.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.440
 Who in lockdown has not given that a bash?

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.560
 What we've got here is something rolled up inside it, and it's a correspondence piece

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.560
 from him.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.560
 Wow.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.200
 It's like a Jenga correspondence from Ian.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:35.000
 So a penis guard is a thing that in Papua New Guinea, for instance, they would make out

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.480
 of a vegetable.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.720
 It's shaped a bit like a long carrot that's been bent into the letter J, and you would

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:47.320
 tie it around your waist and put your penis in there as an isomer clothing.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.320
 Exactly.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.320
 J for Johnson.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.320
 Johnson pocket.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.320
 Yeah.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.320
 And so his letter says, "Hi guys, a while ago, I looked this up, it was about four years

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.280
 ago, you talked about penis goods, and he's just made his first trip home to his parents'

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.880
 place in New Zealand, weirdly, he said, "I thought you could have my penis good since I am not

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:05.880
 using it.

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.800
 I'm sure you can mount it on the wall and use it as a flower vase or pen holder or something

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:10.800
 like that."

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.520
 You can mount it wherever you like, can't you?

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.520
 Hello.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.520
 Hello.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.720
 That's the sound of Dan opening his mouth dangerously in there at the tip of the penis

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.720
 good.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.720
 It's inside.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:20.960
 I did try it on, Dan.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:21.960
 Did you?

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:22.960
 Overclothes.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.520
 I would argue that's not properly trying it on.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.520
 Okay.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.520
 Good point.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.520
 That's how superheroes wear penis goods, though, isn't it?

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.520
 On the outside.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.520
 Super Vanuatu, man.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.520
 Yeah.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.520
 Yeah.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:33.520
 That's where it's from.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.480
 Anyway, so I think we put up a picture of ages ago, we should put up another one, but

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.880
 it's really, really nice.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:39.880
 Thank you.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.120
 It's really nice to have evidence of the thing.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.120
 Do you want a fact that someone sent in?

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.120
 Yes, please.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.400
 So people sent in amazing facts and we sometimes mention them on the show and it's great, but

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.560
 actually they sent in so many.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.280
 I've now got this huge pile of facts I don't know what to do with.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.920
 Here's a fact from a guy called James Milne.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:56.920
 All right?

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.600
 He's one lesser away from an England footballer.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.600
 Yeah.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.600
 Which one?

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.600
 James Milne.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:03.600
 Oh, cool.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.600
 Harry Kane.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.600
 Harry Kane.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.600
 And I know it, James Milne.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.440
 This is just to add into that, as a friend.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.920
 Can we hear the fact?

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:11.920
 No, no.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.200
 Let's build on this friendship of yours.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.200
 Right.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:21.960
 James says the most popular wine in the UK is Strongbow Darkfruits.

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:22.960
 Okay.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:23.960
 Right.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.960
 So that to me sounds like a cider.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:26.960
 Right.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:27.960
 Exactly.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:28.960
 Okay.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:29.960
 I think he's a brewer.

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.120
 He wrote to us because he knows this fact through his work.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.120
 Okay.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.560
 There's a little explanation, but basically, like you say, Darkfruits is counted in the

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.320
 cider category by most people because it's a cider.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.320
 Because that's what it is.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.320
 Yeah, yeah.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:42.320
 Okay.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.720
 So there was a report recently about the best selling alcohol brands of 2021, and Darkfruits

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.720
 was listed.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:48.720
 Yeah.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:53.600
 It sold 158,000 HL, which is hectolilitres, right, that's 100 litres, so that's a huge

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.600
 amount.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.600
 Okay.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:01.600
 The best selling wine sold 90,009 litre packs, so Darkfruits outsold the top wine almost

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.600
 by a factor of 20.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:08.160
 And importantly, though, rather than the figures, what we actually are interested in is a justification

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.160
 for wine.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.160
 I'm getting to it.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.860
 I'm sorry, but I'm sorry for building the fact in an exciting way.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:18.280
 If you ever go to the strongwell, go to the strongwell factory, they have huge vats full

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:23.200
 of dark fruits where everyone stabs on them, don't they?

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:30.000
 The UK government definition of a cider, basically, is something slightly technical, but...

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.480
 Got apples in it, I guess.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.480
 Yeah.

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:36.000
 It's a liquid that's the colour and flavour of apple or pear.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 Okay.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 Okay.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 Oh, that's it.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 Okay, so that's why...

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 Right.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.320
 So Darkfruits cider falls under the made wine category according to HMRC and is taxed as

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:50.280
 made wine, and that is why fruited ciders, like strongbow darkfruits, cost more normally

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.800
 than apples, just like classic cider.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:57.000
 So strongbow darkfruits is the most popular wine in the UK, because it is technically

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 a wine.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 Legally, it's wine.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.920
 So it wasn't that technical, the definition of cider is it's pear or apple fruit.

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:06.520
 Guys, bear with me here, I don't have your grasp on this.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:09.960
 We've got to string out the show some more.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:10.960
 I panicked.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.600
 It was a slightly longer email.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.320
 I couldn't immediately see the explanation, so I said, "That's very technical."

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.320
 Interesting.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:18.320
 Anyway.

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.320
 Wow, that's incredible.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.320
 James knows this through his work.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:24.280
 It's a bold restaurant, isn't it, that puts it on the wine list.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.520
 But when you're scanning, looking for the cheapest wine, it probably is a lot cheaper

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.240
 than all wine, actually.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:34.400
 So you'd be like, "Yeah, I think that's lovely, bottle of your house, strongbow darkfruits."

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:40.040
 If it was served in a wine glass, and you'd already shared a couple of bottles, it's quite

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.040
 possible no one would notice.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.040
 That is true.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.400
 What percentage is a cider versus wine?

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.400
 Is it much lower?

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.400
 Much lower.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:46.400
 Yeah.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.800
 So that's quite nice, you know.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.520
 What sort of ease you off after you've done it?

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.600
 Well, for you say, when the officer says how many glasses of wine you had, you say 12.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:59.720
 He's saying it was cider, but I'm actually, I'm actually...

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.120
 It's only eight.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.960
 So please take that penis cord off in there.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:07.800
 Sorry officer, what?

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:08.800
 Could you blow into this, please?

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:13.800
 No, not that.

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:14.800
 So thank you, James.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:15.800
 That's an amazing...

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:16.800
 I just think that's such a cool fact.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:17.800
 It's a very cool fact.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:18.800
 It's a sort of niche, clever...

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:19.800
 Yeah, lovely.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:20.800
 Really, lovely.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:21.800
 Thank you.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.160
 We've had a complaint from Jam Rain Bird.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.160
 Sorry.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.280
 That's just three words put together.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.280
 Oh, Jam Rain Bird.

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.280
 What a lot of them.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.280
 Jam.

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:31.280
 Yeah, jam.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:32.760
 Could be sure for James.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:33.760
 Really cool.

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:34.760
 Wait, Jam, sorry.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:35.760
 I thought you said jam.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:36.760
 No, it's jam.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:37.760
 Ian with a J.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:38.760
 Jam Rain Bird.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:39.760
 Jam Rain Bird.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.360
 Are you sure that's not an address?

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:45.160
 You know what three words you have addresses when you have three words together.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.160
 Jam Rain Bird.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.080
 Anyway, jam starts very strong.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.160
 I'm so disappointed in all of you.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.160
 No.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.160
 Especially, Dad.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:59.120
 Unfortunately, no, it's a universal pasting from Jam.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.360
 The chocolate is clearly on the bottom of a hobnob.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.360
 Oh, yeah.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.360
 You just had a hobnob.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.360
 I actually just had three.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.360
 Yeah.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:09.400
 And I thought we'd already said the chocolate is on the bottom.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:10.400
 We said it was on the bottom.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.400
 Yeah.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:12.400
 I think I maybe...

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:13.400
 Oh, you argued against it.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.400
 I argued that it's on the top.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.400
 Right.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.960
 Well, does jam justify this?

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:18.960
 Well...

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.320
 Stick to the Dodgers, love.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:24.400
 Oh, my God.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.840
 In response to Andy, they obviously wouldn't show the non-chocolate side on the packet

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.600
 because then they'd be hiding a rather key feature of the product.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:31.600
 Yeah.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.680
 When you said this was a pasting for all of us.

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.520
 Well, I think we all play a role in letting the show go out as it was.

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.520
 Oh, I see.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:40.520
 Editorially.

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:41.520
 Yeah.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.520
 Yeah.

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:43.520
 Okay.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:44.520
 We're responsible.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:45.520
 No, I don't know why I said that.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:46.520
 It's clearly a bollocking for me.

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:50.920
 Because James says, actually, Jam is then speaking up in favour of what you've said.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.840
 James is probably out of this telling off.

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:56.960
 It's exactly dual with the chocolate digestive where the chocolate is clearly on the bottom.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:02.320
 Point two, the bottom of a plain hobnob is clearly a sort of plain hobnob.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.600
 Don't get the penis...

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.480
 I don't know.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.480
 Plain hobnob, anyone?

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:11.440
 The bottom of a plain hobnob is clearly distinct from the top.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:15.800
 Three packets of chocolate hobnob have a top, clearly indicated by the red tear line.

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:19.520
 When you remove hobnob from the packet the chocolate side is facing down, why would

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:20.520
 they put them in the packet?

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:27.000
 So vindication for me from Jam, definitely not James, and Rainbird, definitely not just

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.600
 two random things I saw in the sky and decided to name myself.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:33.600
 Jam Rainbird is a cool name.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.600
 It is.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:35.600
 Very cool.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.600
 I don't seem to have really good names.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.600
 Yeah.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.920
 That's the hidden thing here.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:42.560
 Every name you said has been absolutely next level.

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.560
 Joel Farthing has got in touch.

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:45.560
 Beautiful.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.440
 From the 18th century.

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:48.440
 From Arkansas.

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:49.440
 Oh, yeah.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.440
 Cool.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:51.440
 Joel.

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.600
 Fayetteville, Arkansas.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:57.240
 I'm afraid this is a 200 episode old telling off for him.

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.240
 For James, I'm afraid.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.240
 Oh, come off it.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.240
 Okay.

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.240
 Coincidentally.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.240
 For a jam over here.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.240
 Go on.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:07.200
 I was just listening to episode number 231, during which the panel discussed reginal names

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.200
 and numbers.

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.200
 Oh, yeah.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:13.840
 I thought you'd be interested to recall that James predicted in no uncertain terms

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:18.480
 that Charles would not take the name Charles III and would instead take the next Edward

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:19.480
 Reginald number.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.480
 I don't remember that.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.480
 I do remember that.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.480
 Well, I've been saying that for a while.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:28.720
 In fact, I was saying it to my sister on WhatsApp, literally as the decision was being

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:29.720
 made.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:34.080
 Because she said something on, oh, yeah, Charles III, and I was like, oh, don't be stupid.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.600
 He's not going to be called Charles III.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.080
 Do you know nothing about English history?

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.840
 What was the reason that?

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.360
 Well, the other Charleses have had a bit of a rough time.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:46.440
 And so it's like, it's not a cursed name, but it's like, you know, it was, it was thought

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:49.560
 that he would go with a name with a 50% of them have been decapitated.

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:53.000
 But the other 50%, he wasn't that bad, was he?

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 The second.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 Yeah.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.840
 He just sort of like had a vaguely nondescript reign and then he was very, he was very sexist.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:03.920
 Very hot for the time.

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:05.480
 Are you counselling Charles II?

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:10.160
 I think I, I just read a novel where he's a minor character and like, he's such a disgusting

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.160
 pervert.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.160
 Really?

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.160
 That is a novel, of course.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:14.160
 Yeah.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.160
 No, but it's very well-reserved.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:16.160
 It was Robert Harris.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:17.160
 So it was very well-researched.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.160
 Oh.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.160
 Good evening.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:24.240
 Supposedly his standard greeting for any woman he didn't know was just to thrust his hand

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.240
 between her legs.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.240
 What were about Harris?

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.240
 Charles II.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.240
 Oh, dear.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:36.240
 So, um, so yeah, that's why he's not, that's why we thought perhaps he wouldn't be called.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.240
 What do you think?

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.240
 You thought it was George?

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.760
 No, we thought possibly Edward or George, something like that.

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:41.760
 But yeah.

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:45.960
 Well, I was wrong, but you know, you're going to be when you make so many amazing predictions

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:46.960
 like I do.

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.400
 I went to Nostradamus' house recently.

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:50.400
 Did you?

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.400
 What?

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:52.400
 Amazing predictions.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.400
 You're kidding.

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.400
 He was expecting you, wasn't he?

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.400
 I didn't, I put my hand out to knock.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:15:00.760
 I put a cup of tea in my hand, closed the door again.

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:01.760
 Yeah.

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:02.760
 How was it?

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:08.680
 It's in the south of France and it's in a village called Saint-Rémy-de-Provence.

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:09.680
 That's right.

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:13.280
 I just wrote about him in my book and we don't have time for that.

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:14.280
 Yeah.

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:15.280
 And it's out today.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:16.780
 What's it called?

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:19.000
 That's the theory of everything else.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:26.360
 It's presumably only available in a few bookshops or that actually is it's in all online.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.360
 Every single book.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.360
 That's what I've been told.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:34.040
 If I find a second hand bookshop in the Amazon, only sells you go to Amazon to buy a book.

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:41.520
 This is how Amazon goes to Amazon to play a book.

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.520
 I wonder if that was subconscious.

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:44.520
 That was weird.

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:45.520
 Yeah.

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:46.520
 Yeah.

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:47.520
 But there can't be an audiobook.

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.800
 There absolutely is an audiobook out November 11th.

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:50.800
 Anymore Andy or?

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:51.800
 There's one more.

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:52.800
 This is a...

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:53.800
 I can't tell of it.

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:54.800
 I can't tell of it.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.280
 It's just a bit of an update.

00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:00.960
 So we did a thing about Saint Hubert or Saint Hubert.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:01.960
 Saint Hubert being...

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:02.960
 Yes.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:03.960
 Hubert is...

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.080
 The patron saint of rotisserie chicken.

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.080
 That was my fact.

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:08.080
 Yeah.

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.360
 He was basically to do with the Yagermeister, wasn't he?

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.360
 That's right.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:12.360
 Right.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:16.200
 So his cross is on the Yagermeister bottles and so that's how we got into it.

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.680
 And Wikipedia says he's a patron saint of rotisseries.

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:23.240
 It wasn't of chicken roasts and yes, go on, have we got evidence?

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:28.320
 Well, so no, so this is from Alexandre Mackenzie Foucher.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.320
 Winner.

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.320
 The winner.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.320
 I mean...

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.320
 Ba, ba, ba.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.320
 We have a winner.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.320
 We have a winner.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:38.000
 I like the penis good of victory, that's very funny.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 That's great.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 Okay.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:47.760
 So Alexandre is from Montreal and says, "I found it odd when you mentioned this because

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:52.360
 Saint Hubert, Saint Hubert is a massive and beloved restaurant chain in the province of

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:58.760
 Quebec, Canada known for its rotisserie chicken and it's not named after the patron saint.

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:02.720
 The founder's name is not even Saint Hubert or Hubert.

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.520
 So the rotisserie got its name because the first restaurant was on Saint Hubert Street.

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:11.440
 So it sounds like a joke from someone in Quebec who's put it onto Wikipedia.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.440
 Absolutely.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:15.960
 Alexandre says, "I looked up if it was a coincidence that the street which gave its name to a famous

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:19.080
 rotisserie chicken happened to be the saint of rotisserie chicken.

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:23.760
 The only reference linking the patron saint to chicken I could find in a brief search.

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:27.760
 Basically, Alexandre says, "I was wondering if someone would put this as a joke on Wikipedia."

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:28.760
 Sounds like it.

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:29.760
 Good joke.

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:30.760
 Good.

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:31.760
 Very niche.

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:32.760
 It is.

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:33.760
 How long is it going to take for me to be exposed?

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:36.680
 For Dan Shriver to finally get there.

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.680
 Anyway, so that's that.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:40.360
 That's that for this episode of Drop As Alive.

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:45.640
 Thank you very much for all your facts, for your amazing names, for your name suggestions.

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:49.800
 Please keep all of them coming and we'll see you next time.

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:50.800
 Bye.

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:51.800
 Bye.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:53.280
 You're going to have the catchphrase at the end.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.280
 Oh my catchphrase.

00:17:54.280 --> 00:18:04.280
 [music]

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.860
 (upbeat music)
