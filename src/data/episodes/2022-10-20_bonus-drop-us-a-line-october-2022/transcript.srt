1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
 Let's go and have a look at the hotel.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,280
 Hello, welcome back to Drop As A Line, the Drop As A Line segment of Clubfish where we

3
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,720
 talk about the things that you have been sending to us.

4
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,160
 So first of all guys, we've had lots more feedback on the name Drop As A Line.

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,160
 Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,160
 All good.

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,160
 Mixed.

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,480
 Ginger Hilderman says, "I like Drop As A Line as a name, so thank you Ginger."

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,920
 And all the rest will be negative.

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,240
 A lot of people coming up with their own suggestions.

11
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,240
 Great.

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,240
 Charlie Tuff.

13
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,240
 No, that's a terrible name.

14
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,360
 I like it, I like it.

15
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,080
 Charlie Tuff suggests Piscine Post.

16
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,080
 Okay.

17
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,080
 Oh dear.

18
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,080
 That's not good.

19
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,960
 It looks a bit like Piscine Post.

20
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,960
 Yeah.

21
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,960
 Just about swimming pools.

22
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,960
 Yeah, yeah, exactly.

23
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,960
 Yeah.

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,960
 It's a bit confusing.

25
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,960
 Yeah.

26
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,520
 Jill and Cliff have written, "Given that this is Andy's baby, shouldn't it be Club Moss?"

27
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,040
 Because Club Moss is kind of good.

28
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,040
 Yeah, that's quite good.

29
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,040
 Yeah, that is good.

30
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,040
 But it did take two people to think of it.

31
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,720
 I don't know who did the heavy lifting Jill or Cliff.

32
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,800
 So anyway, I wrote back to them and said, "Thank you for that suggestion."

33
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,720
 And they wrote back again, "Could also have Club Foot for Daddy."

34
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,760
 Stop encouraging them, Andy.

35
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,520
 So, wait, how does that make sense to me?

36
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,520
 What, Big Foot?

37
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,840
 They could be using Club Foot and Big Foot, they do, please.

38
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,120
 Well, no, they say in brackets, "As in Big Foot."

39
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,120
 So, Club Foot.

40
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,120
 Oh, okay.

41
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,360
 I mean, because there is a medical condition called the 12 Foot, which is...

42
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,360
 Well, I think that's what they're referring to.

43
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,360
 I think that might be...

44
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,360
 Okay.

45
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,360
 Well, I would argue that's misleading.

46
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,440
 There's a single by Cossabian called Club Foot.

47
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,360
 Maybe they were thinking you had to call 2000, I suppose it was a great song as well.

48
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,360
 It is.

49
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,360
 Yeah.

50
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,480
 And they come up, "Don't you worry, you guys are great."

51
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,000
 And Canadian Club for Anna.

52
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Oh, yeah.

53
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 I don't know why.

54
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Type of whiskey.

55
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,440
 It's a kind of whiskey, you like it.

56
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,440
 I've got James's.

57
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,440
 I've sorted it.

58
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,440
 Oh, that's good.

59
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,920
 That's good, because Jill and Cliff say, "Can't think of one for James."

60
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,920
 What?

61
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,920
 What?

62
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,920
 I mean, how much do I talk about golf on this podcast?

63
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,920
 You're kidding.

64
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,920
 Are you kidding?

65
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,920
 They don't say golf club?

66
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,480
 In general, you say, "Can't think of one for James."

67
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,480
 Oh, my God.

68
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,480
 Sorry, Jill and Cliff.

69
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,480
 You've undone all your good work.

70
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,480
 Got Club Foot?

71
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,480
 But you're kidding me.

72
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,480
 Yeah.

73
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,800
 I think Club Moss, Club Foot, Canadian Club, and Golf Club.

74
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,080
 Jill and Cliff have done most of the work there.

75
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,080
 So thank you, guys.

76
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,080
 Yeah, lovely work.

77
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,080
 Thank you.

78
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,080
 The King and Queen of Clubs.

79
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,080
 Very nice.

80
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,760
 We've had an email from New Zealand on the name.

81
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,480
 That's the entire country.

82
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,480
 Wow.

83
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,480
 Just in the order.

84
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,480
 Just in the club.

85
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,480
 No, it's from Hayden Freeman.

86
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,480
 So thank you, Hayden.

87
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,480
 From Hamilton in New Zealand.

88
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,600
 I don't know where Hamilton is.

89
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,160
 Your new mailbag show.

90
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,160
 Oh, yeah.

91
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,160
 Thank you.

92
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,160
 Should be called "Hook Us Up."

93
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,160
 Okay.

94
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,320
 "Hook Us Up" with facts, and "Hook Us Up" as fish.

95
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,480
 As fish get hooked up.

96
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,160
 Sorry, what's the title?

97
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,160
 "Hook Us Up."

98
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,160
 "Hook Us Up."

99
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,840
 And that extra bit was just explaining the two versions of what it could be.

100
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,840
 Very nice.

101
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,840
 The subtitle, maybe.

102
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,760
 I could put in quite a mark if you like.

103
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,280
 The quiz you did a few weeks ago, James.

104
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,280
 Oh, yeah.

105
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,280
 Yeah.

106
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,280
 What did we call it at the end?

107
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,280
 No, she thinks it's a quiz.

108
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,280
 Very nice.

109
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,280
 Oh, no.

110
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,440
 There's a bit of debate on what we call that, actually.

111
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,440
 Someone written in a suggestion.

112
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,680
 Well, I lobbied very, yes, they have.

113
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,960
 I lobbied very strongly for the Haar quiz, James Haar quiz.

114
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,960
 Oh, yeah, that was good.

115
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,960
 Yeah, well.

116
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,120
 So, you could call James's quiz, "Harkinon."

117
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,120
 Oh, yeah.

118
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,120
 Okay.

119
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,120
 The quiz that tells the story.

120
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,120
 That's actually not bad.

121
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,120
 That's a genuine suggestion.

122
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,120
 It's not bad.

123
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,120
 I'm up for it.

124
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,240
 You made it worse by the weird "Harkinon" instead of just saying "Harkinon."

125
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,760
 Well, isn't the word "harping" on?

126
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,400
 He was harping on about that.

127
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,400
 Yeah.

128
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,400
 Yeah.

129
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,400
 Well, there's also...

130
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,400
 "Harkins" is his name.

131
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,400
 So, that's what he's done.

132
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,400
 It'd be weird to call it "Harkinon."

133
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,400
 Yeah.

134
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,800
 There's a Finnish motor racing driver called Mika Harkinon.

135
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,800
 Oh, yeah.

136
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,800
 Mika Harkinon.

137
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,800
 Oh, yeah.

138
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,800
 Put on his name.

139
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,800
 Yeah.

140
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,800
 Join his song, "Harkinon."

141
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,800
 It's Mika Harkinon.

142
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,800
 Yeah.

143
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,800
 It's a big one.

144
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,800
 Okay.

145
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,800
 Well, work in progress.

146
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,800
 Work in progress, yeah, yeah.

147
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,800
 Cool.

148
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,240
 What about with "Hark" quiz, if it was an exclamation mark in the middle?

149
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,800
 So, it's like "Hark" quiz, like in the Bible.

150
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,520
 Well, I think for Christmas, we'll have to do that.

151
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,520
 The James Hark quiz.

152
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,520
 Yes.

153
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,120
 But "Hark" doesn't have to be only Christmas.

154
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,880
 "Hark" means the same thing all year round.

155
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,080
 It's just less often heard outside of a Christmas class.

156
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,080
 It's less often or literally never heard outside the line, "Hark, how an angel sings."

157
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,080
 How do you "Hark" at this point?

158
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,080
 Oh, my God.

159
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,320
 Because I want to say something.

160
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,120
 Anna used to work as a town crier, didn't she?

161
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,840
 "Oh, really?"

162
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,520
 We have an email from Ian Fox, which is good, because Ian Fox is also one of the very rare

163
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,440
 people who's posted something physical to the office.

164
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,440
 Oh.

165
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,440
 Okay.

166
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,520
 So Ian sent a fact about Roger Bannister, but that's not the main element, so I'm actually

167
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,520
 going to skip past that.

168
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,160
 Well, at least you haven't mentioned it.

169
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,520
 Left everyone hanging, haunting wall.

170
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,520
 It's a related fact.

171
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,520
 It's not actually about Roger.

172
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,640
 Anyway, look, the point is, Ian Fox then goes on, "Thanks for all the podcasts.

173
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:01,760
 By the way, it took so many years for me to send you my unused penis good, because COVID

174
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,200
 meant it took me so long to get back to my parents' house."

175
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,000
 And Anna, can you just reach over and grab the thing that's over here?

176
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,640
 Can I ask, he says it's an unused penis guard, but actually it's been left unattended in

177
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,440
 his parents' house for a number of years.

178
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,440
 That's a good point.

179
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,440
 During COVID as well.

180
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,440
 Who in lockdown has not given that a bash?

181
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:25,560
 What we've got here is something rolled up inside it, and it's a correspondence piece

182
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,560
 from him.

183
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,560
 Wow.

184
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,200
 It's like a Jenga correspondence from Ian.

185
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:35,000
 So a penis guard is a thing that in Papua New Guinea, for instance, they would make out

186
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,480
 of a vegetable.

187
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,720
 It's shaped a bit like a long carrot that's been bent into the letter J, and you would

188
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:47,320
 tie it around your waist and put your penis in there as an isomer clothing.

189
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,320
 Exactly.

190
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,320
 J for Johnson.

191
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,320
 Johnson pocket.

192
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,320
 Yeah.

193
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:56,320
 And so his letter says, "Hi guys, a while ago, I looked this up, it was about four years

194
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:01,280
 ago, you talked about penis goods, and he's just made his first trip home to his parents'

195
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,880
 place in New Zealand, weirdly, he said, "I thought you could have my penis good since I am not

196
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,880
 using it.

197
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,800
 I'm sure you can mount it on the wall and use it as a flower vase or pen holder or something

198
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,800
 like that."

199
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,520
 You can mount it wherever you like, can't you?

200
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,520
 Hello.

201
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,520
 Hello.

202
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,720
 That's the sound of Dan opening his mouth dangerously in there at the tip of the penis

203
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,720
 good.

204
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,720
 It's inside.

205
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,960
 I did try it on, Dan.

206
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,960
 Did you?

207
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,960
 Overclothes.

208
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,520
 I would argue that's not properly trying it on.

209
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,520
 Okay.

210
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,520
 Good point.

211
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,520
 That's how superheroes wear penis goods, though, isn't it?

212
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,520
 On the outside.

213
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,520
 Super Vanuatu, man.

214
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,520
 Yeah.

215
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,520
 Yeah.

216
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,520
 That's where it's from.

217
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,480
 Anyway, so I think we put up a picture of ages ago, we should put up another one, but

218
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,880
 it's really, really nice.

219
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,880
 Thank you.

220
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,120
 It's really nice to have evidence of the thing.

221
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,120
 Do you want a fact that someone sent in?

222
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,120
 Yes, please.

223
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,400
 So people sent in amazing facts and we sometimes mention them on the show and it's great, but

224
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,560
 actually they sent in so many.

225
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,280
 I've now got this huge pile of facts I don't know what to do with.

226
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,920
 Here's a fact from a guy called James Milne.

227
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,920
 All right?

228
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,600
 He's one lesser away from an England footballer.

229
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,600
 Yeah.

230
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,600
 Which one?

231
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,600
 James Milne.

232
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,600
 Oh, cool.

233
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,600
 Harry Kane.

234
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,600
 Harry Kane.

235
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,600
 And I know it, James Milne.

236
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,440
 This is just to add into that, as a friend.

237
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,920
 Can we hear the fact?

238
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,920
 No, no.

239
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,200
 Let's build on this friendship of yours.

240
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,200
 Right.

241
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:21,960
 James says the most popular wine in the UK is Strongbow Darkfruits.

242
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,960
 Okay.

243
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,960
 Right.

244
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,960
 So that to me sounds like a cider.

245
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,960
 Right.

246
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,960
 Exactly.

247
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,960
 Okay.

248
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,960
 I think he's a brewer.

249
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,120
 He wrote to us because he knows this fact through his work.

250
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,120
 Okay.

251
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,560
 There's a little explanation, but basically, like you say, Darkfruits is counted in the

252
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,320
 cider category by most people because it's a cider.

253
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,320
 Because that's what it is.

254
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,320
 Yeah, yeah.

255
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,320
 Okay.

256
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,720
 So there was a report recently about the best selling alcohol brands of 2021, and Darkfruits

257
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,720
 was listed.

258
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,720
 Yeah.

259
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,600
 It sold 158,000 HL, which is hectolilitres, right, that's 100 litres, so that's a huge

260
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,600
 amount.

261
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,600
 Okay.

262
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:01,600
 The best selling wine sold 90,009 litre packs, so Darkfruits outsold the top wine almost

263
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,600
 by a factor of 20.

264
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:08,160
 And importantly, though, rather than the figures, what we actually are interested in is a justification

265
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,160
 for wine.

266
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,160
 I'm getting to it.

267
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,860
 I'm sorry, but I'm sorry for building the fact in an exciting way.

268
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:18,280
 If you ever go to the strongwell, go to the strongwell factory, they have huge vats full

269
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:23,200
 of dark fruits where everyone stabs on them, don't they?

270
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:30,000
 The UK government definition of a cider, basically, is something slightly technical, but...

271
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,480
 Got apples in it, I guess.

272
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,480
 Yeah.

273
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,000
 It's a liquid that's the colour and flavour of apple or pear.

274
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 Okay.

275
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 Okay.

276
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 Oh, that's it.

277
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 Okay, so that's why...

278
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 Right.

279
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,320
 So Darkfruits cider falls under the made wine category according to HMRC and is taxed as

280
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:50,280
 made wine, and that is why fruited ciders, like strongbow darkfruits, cost more normally

281
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,800
 than apples, just like classic cider.

282
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,000
 So strongbow darkfruits is the most popular wine in the UK, because it is technically

283
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 a wine.

284
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 Legally, it's wine.

285
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,920
 So it wasn't that technical, the definition of cider is it's pear or apple fruit.

286
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,520
 Guys, bear with me here, I don't have your grasp on this.

287
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,960
 We've got to string out the show some more.

288
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,960
 I panicked.

289
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,600
 It was a slightly longer email.

290
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,320
 I couldn't immediately see the explanation, so I said, "That's very technical."

291
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,320
 Interesting.

292
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,320
 Anyway.

293
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,320
 Wow, that's incredible.

294
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,320
 James knows this through his work.

295
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,280
 It's a bold restaurant, isn't it, that puts it on the wine list.

296
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,520
 But when you're scanning, looking for the cheapest wine, it probably is a lot cheaper

297
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,240
 than all wine, actually.

298
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:34,400
 So you'd be like, "Yeah, I think that's lovely, bottle of your house, strongbow darkfruits."

299
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:40,040
 If it was served in a wine glass, and you'd already shared a couple of bottles, it's quite

300
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,040
 possible no one would notice.

301
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,040
 That is true.

302
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,400
 What percentage is a cider versus wine?

303
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,400
 Is it much lower?

304
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,400
 Much lower.

305
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,400
 Yeah.

306
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,800
 So that's quite nice, you know.

307
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,520
 What sort of ease you off after you've done it?

308
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,600
 Well, for you say, when the officer says how many glasses of wine you had, you say 12.

309
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:59,720
 He's saying it was cider, but I'm actually, I'm actually...

310
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,120
 It's only eight.

311
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,960
 So please take that penis cord off in there.

312
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:07,800
 Sorry officer, what?

313
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,800
 Could you blow into this, please?

314
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,800
 No, not that.

315
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,800
 So thank you, James.

316
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,800
 That's an amazing...

317
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,800
 I just think that's such a cool fact.

318
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,800
 It's a very cool fact.

319
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,800
 It's a sort of niche, clever...

320
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,800
 Yeah, lovely.

321
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,800
 Really, lovely.

322
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,800
 Thank you.

323
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,160
 We've had a complaint from Jam Rain Bird.

324
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,160
 Sorry.

325
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,280
 That's just three words put together.

326
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,280
 Oh, Jam Rain Bird.

327
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,280
 What a lot of them.

328
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,280
 Jam.

329
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,280
 Yeah, jam.

330
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,760
 Could be sure for James.

331
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,760
 Really cool.

332
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,760
 Wait, Jam, sorry.

333
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,760
 I thought you said jam.

334
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,760
 No, it's jam.

335
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,760
 Ian with a J.

336
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,760
 Jam Rain Bird.

337
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,760
 Jam Rain Bird.

338
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,360
 Are you sure that's not an address?

339
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,160
 You know what three words you have addresses when you have three words together.

340
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,160
 Jam Rain Bird.

341
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,080
 Anyway, jam starts very strong.

342
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,160
 I'm so disappointed in all of you.

343
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,160
 No.

344
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,160
 Especially, Dad.

345
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,120
 Unfortunately, no, it's a universal pasting from Jam.

346
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,360
 The chocolate is clearly on the bottom of a hobnob.

347
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,360
 Oh, yeah.

348
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,360
 You just had a hobnob.

349
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,360
 I actually just had three.

350
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,360
 Yeah.

351
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,400
 And I thought we'd already said the chocolate is on the bottom.

352
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,400
 We said it was on the bottom.

353
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,400
 Yeah.

354
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,400
 I think I maybe...

355
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,400
 Oh, you argued against it.

356
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,400
 I argued that it's on the top.

357
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,400
 Right.

358
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,960
 Well, does jam justify this?

359
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,960
 Well...

360
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,320
 Stick to the Dodgers, love.

361
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,400
 Oh, my God.

362
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,840
 In response to Andy, they obviously wouldn't show the non-chocolate side on the packet

363
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,600
 because then they'd be hiding a rather key feature of the product.

364
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,600
 Yeah.

365
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,680
 When you said this was a pasting for all of us.

366
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,520
 Well, I think we all play a role in letting the show go out as it was.

367
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,520
 Oh, I see.

368
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,520
 Editorially.

369
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,520
 Yeah.

370
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,520
 Yeah.

371
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,520
 Okay.

372
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,520
 We're responsible.

373
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,520
 No, I don't know why I said that.

374
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,520
 It's clearly a bollocking for me.

375
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:50,920
 Because James says, actually, Jam is then speaking up in favour of what you've said.

376
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,840
 James is probably out of this telling off.

377
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,960
 It's exactly dual with the chocolate digestive where the chocolate is clearly on the bottom.

378
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:02,320
 Point two, the bottom of a plain hobnob is clearly a sort of plain hobnob.

379
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,600
 Don't get the penis...

380
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,480
 I don't know.

381
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,480
 Plain hobnob, anyone?

382
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,440
 The bottom of a plain hobnob is clearly distinct from the top.

383
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,800
 Three packets of chocolate hobnob have a top, clearly indicated by the red tear line.

384
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,520
 When you remove hobnob from the packet the chocolate side is facing down, why would

385
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,520
 they put them in the packet?

386
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:27,000
 So vindication for me from Jam, definitely not James, and Rainbird, definitely not just

387
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,600
 two random things I saw in the sky and decided to name myself.

388
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,600
 Jam Rainbird is a cool name.

389
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,600
 It is.

390
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,600
 Very cool.

391
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,600
 I don't seem to have really good names.

392
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,600
 Yeah.

393
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,920
 That's the hidden thing here.

394
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,560
 Every name you said has been absolutely next level.

395
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,560
 Joel Farthing has got in touch.

396
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,560
 Beautiful.

397
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,440
 From the 18th century.

398
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,440
 From Arkansas.

399
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,440
 Oh, yeah.

400
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,440
 Cool.

401
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,440
 Joel.

402
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,600
 Fayetteville, Arkansas.

403
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,240
 I'm afraid this is a 200 episode old telling off for him.

404
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,240
 For James, I'm afraid.

405
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,240
 Oh, come off it.

406
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,240
 Okay.

407
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,240
 Coincidentally.

408
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,240
 For a jam over here.

409
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,240
 Go on.

410
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,200
 I was just listening to episode number 231, during which the panel discussed reginal names

411
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,200
 and numbers.

412
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,200
 Oh, yeah.

413
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,840
 I thought you'd be interested to recall that James predicted in no uncertain terms

414
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:18,480
 that Charles would not take the name Charles III and would instead take the next Edward

415
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,480
 Reginald number.

416
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,480
 I don't remember that.

417
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,480
 I do remember that.

418
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,480
 Well, I've been saying that for a while.

419
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:28,720
 In fact, I was saying it to my sister on WhatsApp, literally as the decision was being

420
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,720
 made.

421
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,080
 Because she said something on, oh, yeah, Charles III, and I was like, oh, don't be stupid.

422
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,600
 He's not going to be called Charles III.

423
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,080
 Do you know nothing about English history?

424
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,840
 What was the reason that?

425
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,360
 Well, the other Charleses have had a bit of a rough time.

426
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,440
 And so it's like, it's not a cursed name, but it's like, you know, it was, it was thought

427
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,560
 that he would go with a name with a 50% of them have been decapitated.

428
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,000
 But the other 50%, he wasn't that bad, was he?

429
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 The second.

430
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 Yeah.

431
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,840
 He just sort of like had a vaguely nondescript reign and then he was very, he was very sexist.

432
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,920
 Very hot for the time.

433
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,480
 Are you counselling Charles II?

434
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:10,160
 I think I, I just read a novel where he's a minor character and like, he's such a disgusting

435
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,160
 pervert.

436
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,160
 Really?

437
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,160
 That is a novel, of course.

438
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,160
 Yeah.

439
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,160
 No, but it's very well-reserved.

440
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,160
 It was Robert Harris.

441
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,160
 So it was very well-researched.

442
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,160
 Oh.

443
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,160
 Good evening.

444
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:24,240
 Supposedly his standard greeting for any woman he didn't know was just to thrust his hand

445
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,240
 between her legs.

446
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,240
 What were about Harris?

447
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,240
 Charles II.

448
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,240
 Oh, dear.

449
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:36,240
 So, um, so yeah, that's why he's not, that's why we thought perhaps he wouldn't be called.

450
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,240
 What do you think?

451
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,240
 You thought it was George?

452
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,760
 No, we thought possibly Edward or George, something like that.

453
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,760
 But yeah.

454
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,960
 Well, I was wrong, but you know, you're going to be when you make so many amazing predictions

455
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,960
 like I do.

456
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,400
 I went to Nostradamus' house recently.

457
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,400
 Did you?

458
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,400
 What?

459
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,400
 Amazing predictions.

460
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,400
 You're kidding.

461
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,400
 He was expecting you, wasn't he?

462
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,400
 I didn't, I put my hand out to knock.

463
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:00,760
 I put a cup of tea in my hand, closed the door again.

464
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,760
 Yeah.

465
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,760
 How was it?

466
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:08,680
 It's in the south of France and it's in a village called Saint-Rémy-de-Provence.

467
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,680
 That's right.

468
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,280
 I just wrote about him in my book and we don't have time for that.

469
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,280
 Yeah.

470
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,280
 And it's out today.

471
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,780
 What's it called?

472
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,000
 That's the theory of everything else.

473
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:26,360
 It's presumably only available in a few bookshops or that actually is it's in all online.

474
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,360
 Every single book.

475
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,360
 That's what I've been told.

476
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:34,040
 If I find a second hand bookshop in the Amazon, only sells you go to Amazon to buy a book.

477
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:41,520
 This is how Amazon goes to Amazon to play a book.

478
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,520
 I wonder if that was subconscious.

479
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,520
 That was weird.

480
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,520
 Yeah.

481
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,520
 Yeah.

482
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,520
 But there can't be an audiobook.

483
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,800
 There absolutely is an audiobook out November 11th.

484
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,800
 Anymore Andy or?

485
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,800
 There's one more.

486
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,800
 This is a...

487
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,800
 I can't tell of it.

488
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,800
 I can't tell of it.

489
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,280
 It's just a bit of an update.

490
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,960
 So we did a thing about Saint Hubert or Saint Hubert.

491
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,960
 Saint Hubert being...

492
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,960
 Yes.

493
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,960
 Hubert is...

494
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,080
 The patron saint of rotisserie chicken.

495
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,080
 That was my fact.

496
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,080
 Yeah.

497
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,360
 He was basically to do with the Yagermeister, wasn't he?

498
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,360
 That's right.

499
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,360
 Right.

500
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,200
 So his cross is on the Yagermeister bottles and so that's how we got into it.

501
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,680
 And Wikipedia says he's a patron saint of rotisseries.

502
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:23,240
 It wasn't of chicken roasts and yes, go on, have we got evidence?

503
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:28,320
 Well, so no, so this is from Alexandre Mackenzie Foucher.

504
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,320
 Winner.

505
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,320
 The winner.

506
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,320
 I mean...

507
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,320
 Ba, ba, ba.

508
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,320
 We have a winner.

509
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,320
 We have a winner.

510
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,000
 I like the penis good of victory, that's very funny.

511
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 That's great.

512
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 Okay.

513
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:47,760
 So Alexandre is from Montreal and says, "I found it odd when you mentioned this because

514
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:52,360
 Saint Hubert, Saint Hubert is a massive and beloved restaurant chain in the province of

515
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:58,760
 Quebec, Canada known for its rotisserie chicken and it's not named after the patron saint.

516
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,720
 The founder's name is not even Saint Hubert or Hubert.

517
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,520
 So the rotisserie got its name because the first restaurant was on Saint Hubert Street.

518
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:11,440
 So it sounds like a joke from someone in Quebec who's put it onto Wikipedia.

519
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,440
 Absolutely.

520
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,960
 Alexandre says, "I looked up if it was a coincidence that the street which gave its name to a famous

521
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:19,080
 rotisserie chicken happened to be the saint of rotisserie chicken.

522
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:23,760
 The only reference linking the patron saint to chicken I could find in a brief search.

523
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,760
 Basically, Alexandre says, "I was wondering if someone would put this as a joke on Wikipedia."

524
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,760
 Sounds like it.

525
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,760
 Good joke.

526
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,760
 Good.

527
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,760
 Very niche.

528
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,760
 It is.

529
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,760
 How long is it going to take for me to be exposed?

530
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,680
 For Dan Shriver to finally get there.

531
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,680
 Anyway, so that's that.

532
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,360
 That's that for this episode of Drop As Alive.

533
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:45,640
 Thank you very much for all your facts, for your amazing names, for your name suggestions.

534
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,800
 Please keep all of them coming and we'll see you next time.

535
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,800
 Bye.

536
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,800
 Bye.

537
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,280
