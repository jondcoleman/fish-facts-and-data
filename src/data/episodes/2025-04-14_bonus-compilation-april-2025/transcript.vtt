00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.980
 (upbeat music)

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.140
 - Hey Club Fish members, how you doing?

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:04.980
 It's Dan here.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.660
 Hope you're well, welcome to your bonus bit of content.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.780
 This is a compilation episode that we have for you today,

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.500
 all the best bits that didn't make it into the main episode

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.220
 largely 'cause they just didn't fit the narrative.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.500
 So hope you enjoy it, but before we get to it,

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.220
 just a quick reminder, if you happen to be in Sheffield,

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.660
 we're gonna be there doing Fish Live

 at the Crossed Wires Festival.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.940
 Alice Levine put together this awesome podcast festival.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.860
 Okay, that's it, let's get to the main episode now.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.620
 Here we go, the best of the bits that didn't make it.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:55.620
 On with the show.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.100
 (funky music)

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.460
 (funky music)

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.120
 (funky music)

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:14.660
 Hi everybody, Andy here.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.020
 Welcome to an audience fact special episode

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.260
 of no such thing as a fish.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.260
 You have all been sending your thanks to podcast@QI.com.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.780
 Is that the address?

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.600
 - That's the address.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.060
 - I'm gonna say every week, so I hope so.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.200
 - Well, they've been getting through

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.560
 and they've been coming in second first.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.160
 And we've creamed off the ones on the top

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.400
 and we're gonna be reading them out

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.200
 and sharing them back with you.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.800
 - It's harder than it looks, isn't it Andy?

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.740
 - It's a very difficult job.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.840
 - Damn, this is amazing.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.800
 Mother of the year.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.380
 - Do you wanna mention who else is here?

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.680
 - Where are we as well?

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.360
 And how often does this podcast go out?

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.020
 - God.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.300
 - Can I tell you one last thing about the boss for us?

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.140
 - Yeah.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.020
 I was standing to an opal and how it was defended.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.500
 There's one weakness in a naval sense.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.100
 There's a waterway which is calm and navigable.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.660
 And basically, if you could sail your ships in there.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.740
 - Oh, like a harbour.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:05.940
 - Yeah, you could invade.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.660
 And it would be incredibly easy to invade.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.900
 So how did Constantinople, as it was then,

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:10.860
 solve this problem?

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.180
 - Cannons.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.580
 - Great idea.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.580
 Arguably better than what they came up with.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.020
 - Look at dials.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.220
 - Look at those, good call.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.060
 - That's good.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.820
 - What do you do about the chain of the golden horn?

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:25.660
 - Okay.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.500
 - They had a massive chain just across the water.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.340
 - Yep.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.660
 - Like a rope barrier outside of nightclub.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.540
 - Oh, you did this work though.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.180
 - Even to actually, I'm being unfair.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.500
 It worked better than you'd think it would.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.940
 It's about half a mile long.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.540
 Just this huge chain across the water

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.100
 and then they can lower it if someone approaches

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.620
 who's friendly and then what?

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.460
 - You can get up again.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.780
 - There were quite common those things, I think.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:48.620
 - Okay.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.300
 - Yeah, I've heard of them before.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.980
 - I heard of one, this is in like British history

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.300
 but there was one of them somewhere where someone was in a boat

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.340
 and they went in the boat towards this chain

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.660
 and they're gonna hit it and what happened was everyone

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.420
 on the boat ran to the back of the boat

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.340
 so it lifted the front of it, so they went over it

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.900
 and then everyone ran to the front.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:08.740
 - Exactly.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.380
 - So all you know, that's like a hurrieder to story

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.380
 if I ever heard of one.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.980
 - I think it is a story, like Harman were it's from.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:15.820
 - Good.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:16.660
 - That's great.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.220
 - There was a report in Scientific American in 1858

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.660
 about a healthy person called Mr. Groove

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.860
 but he was born without a sternum or a breastbone

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.820
 and so you could see completely clearly his heart

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.660
 and part of his lungs, so it was just a thin layer

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:32.900
 of skin around it.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.620
 And so he'd be exhibited in theatres around Europe

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:36.980
 for a few years in intellectuals

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.700
 because it really helped doctors know

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.820
 about the structure of the heart and how it beat

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.140
 'cause he'd literally stand at the front of a lecture hall

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.460
 and you'd be sitting at the back

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.620
 and you could see his heart bum bumming,

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.580
 bouncing out of his chest.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.500
 - 'Cause he didn't grow properly.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.660
 He was--

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:52.500
 - Wow, good stuff.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.340
 - Wow.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.660
 - It wasn't grew the name of the guy from this pickable me.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:56.500
 - Yeah.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.300
 - So did he have this and then he thought he was so exceptional

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.540
 that he decided to take over the world with his minions.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.660
 - And that's what that's based on.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:03.500
 - Yes.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:04.340
 - There we go.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.500
 - Did he have ribs?

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.020
 - And if so, where did they meet?

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.020
 - I think maybe the ribs didn't meet, no breastbone.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.380
 - It feels like they wouldn't meet.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:14.220
 - Yeah.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.060
 - They just sort of stop.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.900
 - Big holes.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:16.740
 - Big holes.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:17.580
 - Big holes.

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.380
 - He had muscles between your ribs, so he would stay in place.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.220
 - Right.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.060
 - Yeah.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.180
 - It wouldn't be good like my daughter likes to jump on my chest.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.180
 That wouldn't be good.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.020
 - Oh, yeah.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.860
 - I'll start them at that.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:27.700
 - Yeah.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.460
 - And if he coughed or sneeze, then there's long,

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.860
 really bounced out of his chest.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:31.700
 - Oh.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:32.540
 - You really see his lung.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.980
 - And if he really fancied someone like Jessica Rabbit

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.700
 walking past his heart, really.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.100
 So I popped out of his chest.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.220
 - There was actually a really sad study about which bits

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.300
 of their lives people would skip.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.020
 Like if they could say skip a head five minutes

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.220
 for about 10 minutes and it found that people would skip

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.900
 a huge proportion of it.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.700
 Obviously, because most of your life is just drudgery.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.980
 If we could skip to the end of this, guys, we would, wouldn't we?

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.380
 - Well, people listening can just fast-forward to the end.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.380
 (laughing)

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.380
 - If only we could.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.620
 - Accessory breasts.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:03.460
 That's another thing.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.300
 - Accessory.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.740
 - Okay, so you know the classic total recall

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.420
 three-booped lady, three boobs is a thing.

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.220
 But like Andy's saying, you might not know where to find it.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.900
 So it's quite possible that you have three lactating breasts,

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.500
 but in the image that I saw, which to be fair, was a drawing,

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.140
 a lady was breastfeeding her child

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.100
 and then five feeding her other child

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.020
 because the breast had creased.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.340
 - Was this something real?

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.180
 - Yes.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.900
 - This is it from what are your mangoes?

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.500
 (laughing)

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:39.060
 - Herodic mango is unparalleled in this hemisphere.

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.780
 - Same Jerome was a famous translator.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:44.780
 - Really?

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.500
 - Not through like audio.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.180
 He translated the Bible into the Vulgate.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.140
 And what he did was he took the sort of Hebrew Bible

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.020
 and then he put it into Latin.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.100
 But he put it into a way that everyone could understand.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.900
 So he changed some of the words that maybe you shouldn't have done.

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:05.900
 So there was a, in fact a Greek word, which was maskia,

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.340
 which meant like Messiah.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.820
 And he changed it to Christos, meaning anointed.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.140
 But actually the more reasonable way of translating that

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.180
 would be 'unctus', meaning anointed.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.820
 And that is why we call Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.380
 because of that translation.

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.340
 - Oh wow, so we should call him 'unctus'.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.180
 - Jesus-unct.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.220
 - Jesus-unct, yeah.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:32.060
 'Buntiano Ronaldo' should be like anyone called Christian

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.900
 or anything like that should be 'uncty' under at least.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.340
 - He is quite an oily man right now, exactly.

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.700
 But it's not amazing like one little bit of translation

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.740
 can change so much in history.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.380
 - Yeah, when we get Christopher from as well, isn't it?

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:45.540
 - Yeah, Christian, everything.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.700
 - So 'unct', 'unct', 'unct', for example. - Oh.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.540
 (laughing)

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.500
 - The untuffer, untuffer. - Yeah.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.580
 (laughing)

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.500
 - The only thing I know about St. Jerome is that he apparently told,

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.860
 I think this is in the realms of maybe, tree, maybe not, tree.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.940
 He told nuns not to eat beans because he thought the flatulence

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:07.660
 that they would produce is so close to the...

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.860
 - Stainerist, dangerous, theorotic.

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.500
 - That they might induce orgasms accidentally

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.980
 off the tickling sensation of the fart.

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:18.380
 So he said, "Tony beans nuns."

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.220
 And went back to translating the Bible.

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:22.500
 (laughing)

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.940
 - There's a story told by John Sessions on QI

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:27.980
 in one of the early series that you guys might remember,

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.580
 which I always love.

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:31.300
 And I actually don't like, I think his author,

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:32.540
 but he's been told by someone else.

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.940
 He was told by Gandhi himself probably.

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:39.140
 That was what I'm assuming, but basically in the scene,

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.340
 so there are 300,000 extras, as you say,

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:43.260
 and Richard Attenborough's the director.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.380
 And the person who's organizing all the extras

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:48.740
 in the whole scene is this other guy called David Tomlin,

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.020
 who's overseeing this funeral scene.

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:54.940
 So Gandhi's just died, and Attenborough says to Tomlin,

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:58.900
 you've got to tell these 300,000 extras how they're gonna behave.

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:01.820
 And Gandhi's just died their hero,

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:03.860
 like the ultimate icon of their country.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:05.700
 This is the worst news they've ever heard.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:07.780
 They're devastated, their lives have fallen apart

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:08.860
 from all the ray eyes.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:12.060
 Can you possibly convey to them how they have to act?

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.820
 So David Tomlin just turned down to this crowd and said,

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:17.900
 "Right, listen up, Gandhi's dead, and you're all fucking sad."

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.220
 (laughing)

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:23.220
 - Wow, that was very good.

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:24.580
 - So there are three bridges now, I think,

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:28.180
 spanning the boss for us and built it various different times.

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:32.220
 But the 1973 one, the first one was the game changer.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:36.460
 In 1960s, you had to wait two and a half hours to cross,

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:39.260
 I think by car, but it was just so clogged.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.660
 And then for vans and lorries, it was days you had to wait to cross,

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:44.580
 on by boat, before the bridge had happened.

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:45.780
 - Oh yeah.

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:48.020
 - And I listened to this amazing interview with Harvey Binney,

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.620
 who is one of the architects, British guy.

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.740
 He's retired now, obviously, because it was a long time ago.

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:54.100
 And he was interviewed by the BBC,

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.460
 and here's a good riddle of me this.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:57.460
 - Oh, okay, come on.

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:01.740
 - The distance between the tops of the two towers,

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:02.980
 'cause this is a suspension bridge.

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:05.140
 It's got two towers spanning a little bit,

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.460
 is different at the top and at the bottom.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:09.100
 - Riddle me this.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.340
 - Sorry, so as a new take the top,

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.380
 and then you go straight down that pole to the bottom.

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:15.580
 - Those towers are not straight.

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:17.300
 - Well, they are straight.

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:18.580
 - Oh, is it the curvature of the earth?

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:20.380
 - The earth is not straight.

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:21.500
 - That was right, what I said.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:22.500
 - Yeah, okay.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.740
 - Because they had to build both towers absolutely straight,

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.180
 but it's such a distance apart,

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:28.380
 that if you build them both straight,

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:30.060
 the curvature of the earth comes in a way.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:32.060
 And it's about 10 centimeters different at the top.

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:33.060
 - Who's it?

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:34.580
 - We did have to take that into account,

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:38.900
 because you don't want to end up with 10 centimeters of cable.

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:40.060
 - Can you get to the other one?

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:41.460
 - It's long, but it's not that long.

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:43.580
 - The earth doesn't feel that curved, does it?

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.980
 - I know, the earth is more curved than you'd think.

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.500
 - The earth is a lot more curved than dumb things.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:49.340
 - Oh yeah.

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:52.020
 (all laughing)

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.580
 - Oh, me too, okay, now on the go.

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:56.460
 - We're just constantly losing giant containers

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:57.540
 off the back of ships.

00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:58.380
 - Why don't I pick it?

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.340
 You'd want to fish them out as you was in each one.

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:01.180
 - You would, right?

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:01.940
 - You could be a container of baked beans,

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:03.180
 a container of barbies.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:06.620
 - That is a fun format for a TV show.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:07.620
 - How does it work, sorry?

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:08.620
 - They already do this.

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:10.980
 - Well, it's a team of celebrities.

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:13.300
 - But there is one of these that exists,

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:14.420
 but it's on land, right?

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:16.660
 Where you go into containers and you open them up.

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:17.860
 - That's it, it's an American show.

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:19.500
 And you take an all-containing unit

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:22.540
 that's not being claimed, or it's run out,

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.020
 and they haven't paid their rent and so on.

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:24.620
 - Yeah, that doesn't, that doesn't,

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:25.460
 I don't love this show.

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:27.020
 - And a load of experts can look inside,

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:28.740
 but they can't, they can't go in,

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:29.740
 they can't open anything up.

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:31.540
 So you just have to bid an amount for it,

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:34.140
 based on what, you know, what is it called?

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.620
 - Nothing wrong with liking a really good show, you know?

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.100
 As a storage wall, storage wall.

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.380
 - Can I just say if the producers of storage was

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:43.100
 our listening and they want a celebrity to come on,

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:44.260
 then Dan is available.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:45.260
 - I am available.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:46.260
 - It's my house, isn't it?

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:47.860
 I'll send you in this little rowing boat

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:50.220
 to the middle of the Pacific Ocean to find a container.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:53.500
 - The thing about heartbeats is

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:57.340
 some people can hear their own heartbeats better than others.

00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:59.940
 And this is called empty reception.

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:02.540
 And it's the ability to interpret signals

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:03.820
 from inside your body.

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:06.060
 - I'm so hoping you don't say this means

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.060
 I'm going to die prematurely,

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:09.580
 because I hear my heartbeats so loudly all the time.

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:13.020
 - You're more likely to report having anxiety

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:16.260
 if you do that, and you're more likely to,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.460
 if your heartbeats changes slightly,

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.980
 to think it's something to be worried about,

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:22.020
 whereas actually normally,

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:24.380
 people's heartbeats do change quite a lot throughout

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:25.780
 the cost of a day.

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:29.140
 And actually the best thing is to have a medium,

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:30.900
 you want to sometimes hear it a little bit,

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.300
 but not be obsessed with it, basically.

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:36.060
 - So are you concerned about it sometimes, Anna?

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:37.220
 - No, I don't get concerned.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:38.380
 It keeps me awake sometimes,

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:39.340
 'cause you lie down on your pillow,

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:40.300
 you can always hear it in your ear.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:41.860
 - So do you hear it internally,

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:43.620
 or can you hear it outwardly?

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:44.700
 - Hear it out, what, like,

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:46.180
 hear it pretty much gets my shoulder hurt.

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:47.260
 - Yeah, can you, no.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:48.740
 That's physically, I mean,

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:49.580
 can you hear the noise?

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:51.700
 - You're not a cartoon character, aren't you?

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:53.500
 Could your husband hear the noise,

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.180
 or is it through your inner ear?

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:56.020
 - I've never asked him,

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:58.420
 but I snore so loudly that I think it would cover

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:00.860
 your like the, you know, the telltale heart

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:01.700
 by a gorilla heart.

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:02.540
 - Oh yeah.

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:04.020
 - You're like that, your whole life.

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:05.020
 - I am.

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:06.300
 Hang on, what is the heart tell?

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:07.140
 It beats it so much.

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:08.300
 - It's he's murdered somewhere.

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:10.100
 - He's murdered, he's murdered the old man.

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:10.940
 Oh, it happens right away.

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:12.220
 It's sort of straight away,

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:13.260
 he kills the old man,

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.300
 'cause he's got this weird eye.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:16.140
 The old man has a weird eye,

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:17.860
 the guy hates that this old man has this weird eye,

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:19.060
 and he gets obsessed with it,

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:20.900
 and he decides, well, I'm not gonna have to kill the old man,

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.860
 but I mean, I think I just live in the same building

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:25.700
 or something, it's always his landlord or something,

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.180
 but he kills him.

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:29.780
 And then he buries one of the floorboards,

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.300
 and he keeps hearing his heart beat,

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:32.740
 and some people come around to investigate.

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:34.420
 We've heard there's been an old man murdered.

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:35.260
 - Boom, boom.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:36.100
 - And yeah, boom, boom.

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:37.260
 He's like, can you not hear that?

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:38.100
 - No, I don't know.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:38.940
 - No, I was gonna hear it.

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:41.420
 (laughing)

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:42.860
 - I was actually looking up,

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:45.100
 'cause I was thinking I like eel in Japanese restaurants,

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:46.900
 which is the only context I've really had it,

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:48.820
 but obviously it used to be a huge thing.

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:50.660
 It was mostly in London and Cockney's

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:52.020
 and everyone ate jelly deal, right?

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:54.820
 You'd have pie, mash, and eel shops, or whatever.

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:55.660
 - That's right.

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:58.060
 - I was wondering, was it nice?

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:01.020
 And honestly, I've been through so many forums

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:02.940
 where people were reminiscing about using it

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:06.100
 and not a single person has said it wasn't disgusting.

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.580
 - And that's presumably, if you're posting on those forums,

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:10.220
 you're kind of nostalgic or buffer.

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:11.060
 - Exactly.

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:13.060
 - I would think is the prime territory.

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:13.900
 - You're desperate to say,

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:15.860
 "Oh, it was better in the good old days."

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.700
 (laughing)

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.980
 - It was rank, I thought.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:22.420
 After Brexit, I thought we were gonna get it back.

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:23.260
 - Did you?

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:24.260
 - Yeah, that was the Sunlit Uplands

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:25.100
 that I was looking for.

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:26.660
 - That's what you voted for, wasn't it?

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:27.500
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:28.660
 - Prick that the jelly deal.

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:31.020
 - No, actually Brexit has stuffed the eel thing.

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:31.860
 - Oh, no.

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.260
 - I'm so sorry, it has.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:34.100
 - Wasted voters.

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:38.260
 - I'm sure you guys are familiar with the Sustainable eel group.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.380
 Basically, we used to ship 10 million eels a year to Europe.

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:43.140
 Legally, this isn't traffic.

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:45.300
 And more than half of that was for rewilding.

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:47.140
 'Cause if you get an eel swimming into the Seven Astray,

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:48.140
 it's screwed, right?

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:50.100
 It's like, it can't get up the Seven Astray

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:51.420
 to a spawning ground.

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:52.820
 The river is too blocked up.

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:54.540
 But there are loads of places in Europe

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:56.220
 where you can introduce Neil.

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:59.180
 It'll swim up, it'll find a cracking place to spawn, whatever.

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:01.260
 And you've done a great job there.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:02.580
 But Brexit has ruined it.

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:04.860
 - 'Cause they can't fill in the paperwork and stuff.

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:05.860
 - It's good.

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:07.540
 - Yeah, they can't fill in the paperwork.

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:09.140
 But it basically tried barriers.

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.340
 - Yeah, it's a bit of a pain.

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:13.180
 - Does your heart really go blah, blah, blah?

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:14.180
 Does it just go blah, blah?

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:16.540
 And you've just heard the blah, blah, blah in movies.

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:17.380
 - Or is it an echo?

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:18.540
 Is the--

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:19.380
 - Oh, oh.

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:20.820
 - If you've got a very hollow body.

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:21.660
 (laughing)

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:22.500
 - Yeah.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:23.340
 - The hollow head.

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:24.500
 - I'm just testing now.

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:25.660
 - It does go blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:26.500
 - Does it?

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:27.580
 - Sometimes I'm only using really hard, I think.

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:28.860
 - I can only hear the, at the moment,

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:29.700
 I can only hear the boom.

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:30.860
 - Yeah.

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:32.820
 - Well, you're using your pulse.

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:33.660
 - Yeah.

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:34.500
 - You're not listening to your--

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:35.660
 - But it's like, for instance, if you listen--

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:37.540
 - But what do you think the, what do you think the heart is?

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:39.820
 - Well, I think the heart, I, the boom,

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:41.700
 I associate with heart, not with my pulse.

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:43.700
 I know that you can feel the pulse,

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:45.100
 but you can't say, oh, I can hear my heart

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:47.060
 by touching your veins on your wrist.

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:47.900
 - Yeah.

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:49.420
 - It's like, this is all got a bit stoner,

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:50.260
 but go on James.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:54.020
 - Right back, well, I doubt I will, but it's like with a clock, you know,

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:56.780
 clock ticks, but it doesn't talk.

00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:59.900
 It just goes tick, tick, tick, because it's the same mechanism

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:01.060
 doing it all the time.

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:03.940
 But if you're, if you listen to it, you can almost hear a talk

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:05.940
 even though there's not one there because you're expecting it.

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:07.300
 - I was playing it cool by agreeing with you,

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.860
 but I absolutely thought there was a talk.

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:11.460
 - Go in every clock.

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:13.220
 They'd entered two different tones, just before.

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:16.420
 - I thought the pendulum, yeah, I assumed for years and years

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:18.340
 when the pendulum goes one way, that makes a tick sound.

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:21.940
 And then, I don't know, inside the glass cabinet, there's something

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:24.060
 which makes it sound a bit different going the other way.

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:26.580
 - It's weird that you still got that pendulum watch.

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:28.340
 - There is a different kind of eel,

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:29.700
 which does a similar-ish thing.

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.140
 It's called a snake eel.

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:35.420
 And they have a very pointy tip on their tail.

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:37.140
 And they use it in a slightly different way.

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:40.260
 They use it just to power out of the stomach of the fish,

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:41.900
 which has eaten the sideways.

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:43.620
 I mean, they just go out of the stomach.

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:44.780
 - Oh, like here's it.

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:45.620
 - They just pierce it.

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:46.460
 They just go through.

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:47.740
 - Well, that sounds not very good for the fish.

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:49.300
 It's not good for anyone, because they can't get through

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:51.420
 the ribcage once they're through the stomach.

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:53.300
 So they just end up stuck in there.

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:55.500
 - That's like a blooper from the alien movies.

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:57.100
 (laughing)

00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:00.940
 The alien's like, "I'm stuck, we're gonna have to do this again."

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:02.860
 - Yeah, and the fish doesn't even notice.

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:06.180
 Fish can cope with a lot of stuff.

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:08.460
 - Something piercing a big hole in its stomach

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:10.420
 and then landing up squirming around at its ribcage.

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:11.980
 - Okay, I don't know whether they don't notice,

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:14.700
 but they definitely don't take any action.

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:15.540
 - They play cool.

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:16.380
 - They play cool.

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:17.220
 - Yeah, good on 'em.

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:20.260
 - Oh, if you eat muscles as a human,

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.220
 you put them in the pot and it's boiling water.

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:23.980
 - They often come back out, don't they?

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:24.820
 - Oh, okay.

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:25.660
 - Pricing onto it.

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:27.220
 - But you're not supposed to eat the clothes ones

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:28.340
 'cause they might come out.

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:29.180
 - Yeah.

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:30.700
 - Well, that is actually true if you're a sea an enemy.

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:33.300
 If you eat a muscle and it's closed,

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:35.100
 then the muscle can just go through your body

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:37.900
 and come out the other end and the muscle will still be fine.

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:39.060
 - Oh, really?

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:39.900
 - Yeah.

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:41.060
 Whereas normally what they'll do

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:43.500
 is they'll bring in the muscle and the shell

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:45.620
 and then they'll eat the muscle and eject the shell,

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:47.100
 but if it's closed, they can't get us

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:47.940
 to the muscle.

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:50.980
 - Do the enemies and enemies eat the whole thing

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:52.740
 and then to sort it out inside?

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:54.980
 'Cause that's a more dignified way of eating, I think.

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:55.820
 - Yeah.

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:57.220
 - Now, if you could do that with a lobster.

00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:58.940
 - If you could do that with a big mac

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:03.020
 and you put in the entire burger and the plastic

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:04.740
 that goes round it.

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:05.740
 - With a plastic on the trees.

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:07.220
 - Oh, if you could, yeah.

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:08.700
 (laughing)

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:11.220
 - Or if you could do it with a kinder egg

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:12.500
 and then you could eat the whole thing

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.500
 and you could even make the tie inside you.

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:15.340
 - I love that.

00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:16.740
 (laughing)

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:18.460
 - There's a little mechanical women on those.

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:20.460
 (laughing)

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:23.940
 50% of eel consumed on the planet is eaten in Japan.

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:24.780
 - It's big.

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:25.980
 - And if you go to a Japanese restaurant,

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:28.620
 they'll always have, they have eel on the menu.

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:32.060
 But the nice news is that 35% of Japanese people

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:33.900
 are willing to eat cultured eel.

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:35.380
 - What eel that goes to the theatre?

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:36.220
 - That's right.

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:37.060
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:38.420
 It costs more because obviously you've seen the price

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:39.740
 of the restaurant these days.

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:42.420
 (laughing)

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:43.420
 - No, you can't.

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:46.460
 It's saturated laden is, it light Hamilton.

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:47.540
 It doesn't love it.

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:48.860
 It wasn't five stars.

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:52.260
 But no, it's like, you can grow really good eel now.

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:53.940
 You know, the art of it, like growing meats

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:55.420
 which are of different varieties.

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:57.100
 The eel you can get now is really, really nice.

00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:58.140
 - We're at like fake eel.

00:17:58.140 --> 00:17:58.980
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:17:58.980 --> 00:17:59.820
 - Oh, really?

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:01.740
 - It looks like it, it tastes like it, all of that, you know?

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:03.020
 So that might be quite good.

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:05.060
 - And how many Japanese people are willing to eat that?

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:05.900
 - Over a third.

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:07.300
 - That's good figures.

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:08.220
 That's much better than like,

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:10.900
 proportions of American people who are willing to eat fake meat.

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:11.900
 I suspect cultured meat.

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:13.820
 - Yeah, but we all say we're willing to eat kangaroo

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:15.260
 testicles until we're actually on.

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:16.740
 I'm a celebrity, give me out here.

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:17.580
 (laughing)

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:18.740
 And then, you know what I'm saying?

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:19.580
 - You're right.

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:20.420
 - You're right.

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:24.780
 - Alfred Hitchcock was terrified of eggs had over phobia.

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:28.300
 So he said, the white round thing without any holes.

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:29.860
 That's how we refer it to eggs.

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:32.780
 And when you break it inside, there's that yellow thing

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:35.340
 round without any holes.

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:38.740
 So I think he likes holes and he doesn't like eggs.

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:40.340
 - Did he like ping pong balls?

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:41.180
 - Yeah, I don't know.

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:42.460
 He's no mention on ping pong balls,

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:44.900
 but what's interesting is his favorite breakfast

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.900
 was quiche Lorraine and he used to make it himself.

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:48.740
 - What?

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:50.540
 - Yeah, so he would have to deal with his phobia

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:53.060
 until the egg no longer resembled an egg.

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:54.060
 And then he was fine with it.

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:55.060
 - Stick hole in it.

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:56.660
 - Stick hole in it, yeah.

00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:58.780
 - So that says to me, wasn't that serious?

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:00.820
 Was it if he's still making his own quiche Lorraine?

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:03.380
 - No, 'cause I think it's a sort of,

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:05.380
 you face your fears and then it goes quite quickly

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:06.660
 once you get the fear.

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:08.380
 For him it was the shape and the lack of hole.

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:09.380
 - No, no, I know, but if I like,

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:10.820
 I don't like a house spider.

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:14.060
 And I can't just like go and kill a house spider really fast

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:15.100
 and be like, well, it was really quick,

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:15.940
 so it doesn't matter.

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:16.780
 - I see, yeah.

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:17.620
 - 'Cause I can't go near it.

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:19.940
 - The other day I met a house spider fell on me

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:23.140
 as I was sitting up in bed from the ceiling.

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:23.980
 And it was, it was a bit--

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:25.500
 - It told me this before I didn't enjoy the story

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:26.740
 at the time, I'm not enjoying it now.

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:27.740
 - It was a four-incher.

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:28.580
 - I don't like it.

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:29.580
 - And I was shirtless.

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:31.220
 - That's not four-inchers for you.

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:34.460
 (all laughing)

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:36.660
 - So low-albender, right?

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:37.820
 If you haven't already covered this,

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:39.620
 I'd like you to know that some US banks

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:41.340
 have their own zip code.

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:42.180
 - Oh, nice.

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:43.020
 - It's cool, isn't it?

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:43.860
 - Okay.

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:45.460
 - And then they write, I came across this

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:48.700
 because for reasons unknown to me, meetup.com

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:50.260
 defaulted to that zip code.

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:52.420
 But I'm in and then they give their own zip code.

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:53.660
 (all laughing)

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:54.500
 - Which is?

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:57.060
 - Well, I think this might be a call for help, really.

00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:57.900
 - Yeah.

00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:59.460
 - What's meetup.com?

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:01.140
 - Well, it sounds like a dating site.

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:01.980
 - It does, doesn't it?

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:04.940
 - And it then sounds like he's trying to give his address

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:07.660
 on the podcast, or she, or they.

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:11.340
 So I wonder if this is just a trick to try and get some

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:12.180
 - Yeah.

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:13.020
 - Fistless.

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:13.860
 - Three meetups.

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:14.900
 - Are we being cat-fished?

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:15.740
 - Brilliant.

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:16.740
 - Right now.

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:17.700
 - Wait, I'm so confused.

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:19.660
 So this person went on a dating site

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:22.100
 and ended up accidentally booking in a date with a bank.

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:23.100
 (all laughing)

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:25.900
 Went to meet the date, had put misleading pictures up

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:28.540
 of a not bank, and then arrived in it with a bank.

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:29.380
 - No, it's better.

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:30.420
 - Come over and make a deposit.

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:32.180
 I bet the innuendo is going to be,

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:33.220
 what's the safe word?

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:34.060
 There we go.

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:34.900
 - Yep, there we go.

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:35.900
 - I'm good, yeah, yeah.

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:36.740
 - Put 'em up.

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:38.420
 (all laughing)

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:39.260
 - This is a stick-up.

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:42.780
 (all laughing)

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:45.180
 - I make the same mistake every week when we do this,

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:46.780
 and then I go home, and I get sushi

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:48.020
 for the thing next to the station,

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:49.660
 you know, which comes with soy sauce and wasabi.

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:51.620
 But it's always rammed the train.

00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:53.460
 So I squeeze in, and then you have to get the chopsticks out

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:54.940
 and you have to open the soy sauce,

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:56.420
 and you have to open the soy sauce.

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:57.580
 And it goes just everywhere.

00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:59.820
 - And you have to ask someone to hold your fingerball,

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:02.540
 and it's, you had to take your shoes off as well.

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:03.620
 It's like that.

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:04.460
 - But you know when you started,

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:05.980
 you're like, people would think I've given up

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:07.220
 if I don't keep going.

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:09.900
 So I'm always covered in soy sauce and it's stink.

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:11.700
 - I don't think people think about you that much.

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:12.700
 I don't mean to offend,

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:14.340
 but just most people are busy with their own stuff.

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:15.940
 They're not gonna think that woman's only,

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:18.180
 "I want to stop eating her sushi half."

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:19.020
 - What's going on?

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:19.860
 - Oh, what?

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:21.180
 - She's the top-podcast that I'm at.

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:23.180
 - Shinski eating half a sushi.

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:24.260
 (all laughing)

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:25.340
 - She's quit, isn't she?

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:26.180
 She's turned.

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:27.300
 That was to finish it.

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.260
 - Why don't you go and eat the other half?

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:31.860
 (all laughing)

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:33.460
 - You used to hurt dinner.

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:34.900
 - Oh shit, I missed my start.

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.060
 (all laughing)

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:37.900
 - It was worth it.

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:38.740
 - It was worth it.

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:43.100
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:44.420
 and that is Andy.

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:46.220
 My fact is that after Chernobyl,

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:48.740
 nearby children were tweeted.

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:51.980
 And they taught, they taught.

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:54.500
 We're putting that in there.

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:55.500
 - Good.

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:58.300
 - Someone sent us a tweet this morning, actually,

00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:01.220
 Sean Gibson, and it was referring to,

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:04.420
 it's just a headline from the Intelligencie Journal

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:06.740
 in Pennsylvania from 1913,

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:09.740
 Self-Rising Bed exceeds expectations

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:11.980
 and throws inventor out of the window.

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:13.980
 (all laughing)

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:15.660
 No more information given.

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:17.500
 - Brilliant, I need it.

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.900
 - The thing that you have always done back up since I was tiny

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:21.300
 is you drink some water upside down.

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:22.900
 - Yeah, that all of that stuff is rubbish.

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:23.740
 - No, it works.

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:24.580
 - No, it doesn't.

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:25.420
 - It's just a distraction, Tony.

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:26.420
 - It's been proven to be all rubbish.

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:27.260
 - It works for me.

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:28.340
 - No, it doesn't.

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:29.540
 - You're still hiccuping.

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:30.380
 (all laughing)

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:31.220
 You've been doing it all day.

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:32.060
 - No, not.

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:37.540
 - My headline thanks this week is from Jeffrey Partica

00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:40.060
 or Partica or Parti Car.

00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:40.900
 - Partica, yeah.

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:42.060
 - Partica, yeah, it's possible.

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:43.460
 - Remember when we went to Dublin,

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:44.660
 and we got in a Partica.

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:45.500
 - Yeah, that was cool.

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:46.340
 - That was cool.

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:47.180
 - That was the taxi.

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:48.020
 - Unintentionally, we didn't know.

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:48.860
 - I don't remember that.

00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:50.420
 - We got a taxi home from a gig,

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:52.380
 and then the guy just pressed a button,

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:53.860
 and all the lights start going off,

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:55.100
 and there's like a disco ball,

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:56.100
 and they started playing music.

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:57.420
 - It just went thundersly disco,

00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:59.140
 like-- - They always do that in taxis for me.

00:22:59.140 --> 00:22:59.980
 - It's very cool.

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:00.980
 - All right, yeah.

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:01.820
 - What do you don't remember?

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:03.340
 (laughing)

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:06.260
 - Electric heels are not a type of heel.

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:07.100
 - Are they not?

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:08.100
 - No, they don't seem they were.

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:10.780
 - They're just an electric fish that's very long.

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:12.540
 But I thought I'd read about them anyway.

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:15.420
 There's this absolutely hero called Ken Catania,

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:18.980
 who's worked out what it feels like to be attacked

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:20.180
 by an electric heel,

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:23.700
 and he says that being attacked by a large electric heel

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:26.940
 is like being tazered by nine tazers at the same time.

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:29.540
 - Well, what he did was he stuck his tank arm

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:31.420
 into a tank with a small eel.

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:32.700
 - I did it 10 times,

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:35.420
 and he reckons because he knows how electric heels work.

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:37.660
 You could just extrapolate from the small eel

00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:39.460
 to the size of a normal eel.

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:42.740
 So if you get bitten by a small electric heel,

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:45.500
 it's about the same as touching a horse fence.

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:46.340
 - Okay.

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:47.180
 - Do you know what that's like?

00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:48.100
 - I do, actually, yeah.

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:50.260
 - Yeah, 'cause you like to steal horses, don't you?

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:52.060
 - I do, I do, I use to raise on the podcast,

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:53.260
 but yeah, my horse rusted that.

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:55.580
 - You've touched an electrified horse fence.

00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:57.180
 - Yeah, well, 'cause you know, when you're a kid,

00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:57.940
 we used to line up,

00:23:57.940 --> 00:23:58.980
 so one of you touched the fence,

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:00.980
 and then everyone holds onto the other one shoulders,

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:01.820
 and then you--

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:03.220
 - Okay, so it's a bit of a shock, it's not a shock.

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:04.300
 - It's quite a shock.

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:05.740
 - Hang on, if you're holding it normally,

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:08.180
 does it not shock you at all because you're earthed

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:09.660
 with your rubber shoes or other?

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:11.100
 - No, the earth thing is the problem, right?

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:12.420
 'Cause it goes through your body together.

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:13.260
 - Oh, sorry.

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:15.100
 - So you're not wearing your big wellies at this point?

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:16.380
 - No, no, the whole point is to shock you

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:17.860
 and your all your friends in a line.

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:19.300
 Anyway, electric heels work.

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:21.300
 He says, but he hasn't actually had the bulls

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:23.540
 to sting himself with a proper big one.

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:26.420
 - No, because actually if you're tazered by nine tazers,

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:27.580
 you have properly get it die.

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:28.420
 - Yeah.

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:30.140
 - Oh, good idea, very nice.

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:31.900
 (laughing)

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:34.700
 - And one interesting thing is that they use their electricity

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:37.380
 for electro-location so they can,

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:40.020
 a bit like so now, they can kind of fire their electric field

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:42.900
 around and then feel where everything is.

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:45.740
 So 'cause it's so dark and muddy down there,

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:48.100
 and that's how they can see where everything is.

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:51.140
 But the sensors that they use, it's not exactly the same,

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:53.180
 but it's very, very similar principles

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:55.540
 to how your mobile phone works.

00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:58.460
 So you know how there's sensors in there

00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:00.540
 that kind of can tell that your fingers there

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:02.540
 and it's all about capacitors and blah, blah, blah,

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:03.540
 I'm not gonna go into it now,

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:05.780
 but it's basically the same technology

00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:07.860
 as electric heels used to find the way around.

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:08.700
 - Do you see?

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:09.940
 You've got all your clever computers

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:11.540
 and all your internet in the old days,

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:14.460
 we got around just with ill tech.

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:16.020
 (laughing)

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:17.740
 And we jelly him up at the end of the day.

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:20.020
 It was absolutely horrible.

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:23.020
 (laughing)

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:26.260
 I was, isn't it weird that when you have a bisectomy

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:27.980
 and then you produce semen?

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:29.220
 What would you think that looks like?

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:31.860
 'Cause you know when you think about, you picture semen.

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:32.700
 - Yeah.

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:33.540
 - And you think that that's--

00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:34.780
 - I can't picture anything in my head,

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:37.140
 but I'm not, not even gonna try this one.

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:38.580
 - It probably looks absolutely identical.

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:40.860
 Yeah, maybe, or just a bit more watery.

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:43.020
 - That's what I would have thought it looks more watery.

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:45.140
 - It looks like more transparent, maybe.

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:47.140
 - Maybe it doesn't have those green bits there.

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:48.300
 (laughing)

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:49.140
 - It's just...

00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:51.740
 (laughing)

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:53.660
 (laughing)

00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:55.620
 - We still got the chunky cheesy bits, right?

00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:56.620
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:58.740
 (laughing)

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:01.740
 - It's a different shoe they need to color, James.

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:03.340
 - It's not, it's doesn't sparkle.

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:05.180
 (laughing)

00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:06.980
 - Well, in a way, it doesn't sparkle.

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:07.820
 - It doesn't sink.

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:09.420
 It doesn't make that weird singing sound.

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:10.980
 (laughing)

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:12.180
 - It's not weird.

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:15.060
 - There's some screaming here, so they go.

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:15.900
 - Don't do it.

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:16.900
 - You're right around.

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:18.060
 (laughing)

00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:19.940
 - I go to Val Halag.

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:22.100
 - We'll fight them on the beach.

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:23.100
 - So Anna, Anna, come on.

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:24.500
 - Tell them more, I wanted to assist his name.

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:25.980
 - Where did you want it to go?

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:26.820
 - Where?

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:28.340
 - 'Cause you want it to go.

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:30.940
 (upbeat music)

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:34.300
 - Okay, doki.
