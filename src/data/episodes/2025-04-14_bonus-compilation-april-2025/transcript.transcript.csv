00:00:08,00:00:11,"This is a compilation episode that we have for you today,"
00:00:11,00:00:14,all the best bits that didn't make it into the main episode
00:00:14,00:00:17,largely 'cause they just didn't fit the narrative.
00:00:17,00:00:19,"So hope you enjoy it, but before we get to it,"
00:00:19,00:00:22,"just a quick reminder, if you happen to be in Sheffield,"

00:00:56,00:00:59,(funky music)
00:00:59,00:01:01,(funky music)
00:01:01,00:01:04,(funky music)
00:01:04,00:01:14,"Hi everybody, Andy here."
00:01:14,00:01:18,Welcome to an audience fact special episode
00:01:18,00:01:19,of no such thing as a fish.
00:01:19,00:01:23,You have all been sending your thanks to podcast@QI.com.
00:01:23,00:01:24,Is that the address?
00:01:24,00:01:25,- That's the address.
00:01:25,00:01:28,"- I'm gonna say every week, so I hope so."
00:01:28,00:01:29,"- Well, they've been getting through"
00:01:29,00:01:30,and they've been coming in second first.
00:01:30,00:01:32,And we've creamed off the ones on the top
00:01:32,00:01:33,and we're gonna be reading them out
00:01:33,00:01:35,and sharing them back with you.
00:01:35,00:01:37,"- It's harder than it looks, isn't it Andy?"
00:01:37,00:01:39,- It's a very difficult job.
00:01:39,00:01:41,"- Damn, this is amazing."
00:01:41,00:01:42,Mother of the year.
00:01:42,00:01:46,- Do you wanna mention who else is here?
00:01:46,00:01:47,- Where are we as well?
00:01:47,00:01:49,And how often does this podcast go out?
00:01:49,00:01:51,- God.
00:01:51,00:01:53,- Can I tell you one last thing about the boss for us?
00:01:53,00:01:54,- Yeah.
00:01:54,00:01:56,I was standing to an opal and how it was defended.
00:01:56,00:01:58,There's one weakness in a naval sense.
00:01:58,00:02:01,There's a waterway which is calm and navigable.
00:02:01,00:02:03,"And basically, if you could sail your ships in there."
00:02:03,00:02:04,"- Oh, like a harbour."
00:02:04,00:02:05,"- Yeah, you could invade."
00:02:05,00:02:07,And it would be incredibly easy to invade.
00:02:07,00:02:09,"So how did Constantinople, as it was then,"
00:02:09,00:02:10,solve this problem?
00:02:10,00:02:13,- Cannons.
00:02:13,00:02:14,- Great idea.
00:02:14,00:02:16,Arguably better than what they came up with.
00:02:16,00:02:20,- Look at dials.
00:02:20,00:02:21,"- Look at those, good call."
00:02:21,00:02:22,- That's good.
00:02:22,00:02:24,- What do you do about the chain of the golden horn?
00:02:24,00:02:25,- Okay.
00:02:25,00:02:28,- They had a massive chain just across the water.
00:02:28,00:02:29,- Yep.
00:02:29,00:02:31,- Like a rope barrier outside of nightclub.
00:02:31,00:02:33,"- Oh, you did this work though."
00:02:33,00:02:35,"- Even to actually, I'm being unfair."
00:02:35,00:02:37,It worked better than you'd think it would.
00:02:37,00:02:38,It's about half a mile long.
00:02:38,00:02:40,Just this huge chain across the water
00:02:40,00:02:43,and then they can lower it if someone approaches
00:02:43,00:02:44,who's friendly and then what?
00:02:44,00:02:45,- You can get up again.
00:02:45,00:02:47,"- There were quite common those things, I think."
00:02:47,00:02:48,- Okay.
00:02:48,00:02:50,"- Yeah, I've heard of them before."
00:02:50,00:02:52,"- I heard of one, this is in like British history"
00:02:52,00:02:56,but there was one of them somewhere where someone was in a boat
00:02:56,00:02:59,and they went in the boat towards this chain
00:02:59,00:03:01,and they're gonna hit it and what happened was everyone
00:03:01,00:03:03,on the boat ran to the back of the boat
00:03:03,00:03:06,"so it lifted the front of it, so they went over it"
00:03:06,00:03:07,and then everyone ran to the front.
00:03:07,00:03:08,- Exactly.
00:03:08,00:03:11,"- So all you know, that's like a hurrieder to story"
00:03:11,00:03:12,if I ever heard of one.
00:03:12,00:03:14,"- I think it is a story, like Harman were it's from."
00:03:14,00:03:15,- Good.
00:03:15,00:03:16,- That's great.
00:03:16,00:03:20,- There was a report in Scientific American in 1858
00:03:20,00:03:22,about a healthy person called Mr. Groove
00:03:22,00:03:25,but he was born without a sternum or a breastbone
00:03:25,00:03:28,and so you could see completely clearly his heart
00:03:28,00:03:31,"and part of his lungs, so it was just a thin layer"
00:03:31,00:03:32,of skin around it.
00:03:32,00:03:35,And so he'd be exhibited in theatres around Europe
00:03:35,00:03:36,for a few years in intellectuals
00:03:36,00:03:38,because it really helped doctors know
00:03:38,00:03:40,about the structure of the heart and how it beat
00:03:40,00:03:43,'cause he'd literally stand at the front of a lecture hall
00:03:43,00:03:44,and you'd be sitting at the back
00:03:44,00:03:46,"and you could see his heart bum bumming,"
00:03:46,00:03:48,bouncing out of his chest.
00:03:48,00:03:50,- 'Cause he didn't grow properly.
00:03:50,00:03:51,He was--
00:03:51,00:03:52,"- Wow, good stuff."
00:03:52,00:03:53,- Wow.
00:03:53,00:03:55,- It wasn't grew the name of the guy from this pickable me.
00:03:55,00:03:56,- Yeah.
00:03:56,00:03:59,- So did he have this and then he thought he was so exceptional
00:03:59,00:04:01,that he decided to take over the world with his minions.
00:04:01,00:04:02,- And that's what that's based on.
00:04:02,00:04:03,- Yes.
00:04:03,00:04:04,- There we go.
00:04:04,00:04:05,- Did he have ribs?
00:04:05,00:04:09,"- And if so, where did they meet?"
00:04:09,00:04:12,"- I think maybe the ribs didn't meet, no breastbone."
00:04:12,00:04:13,- It feels like they wouldn't meet.
00:04:13,00:04:14,- Yeah.
00:04:14,00:04:15,- They just sort of stop.
00:04:15,00:04:15,- Big holes.
00:04:15,00:04:16,- Big holes.
00:04:16,00:04:17,- Big holes.
00:04:17,00:04:20,"- He had muscles between your ribs, so he would stay in place."
00:04:20,00:04:21,- Right.
00:04:21,00:04:22,- Yeah.
00:04:22,00:04:24,- It wouldn't be good like my daughter likes to jump on my chest.
00:04:24,00:04:25,That wouldn't be good.
00:04:25,00:04:26,"- Oh, yeah."
00:04:26,00:04:26,- I'll start them at that.
00:04:26,00:04:27,- Yeah.
00:04:27,00:04:29,"- And if he coughed or sneeze, then there's long,"
00:04:29,00:04:30,really bounced out of his chest.
00:04:30,00:04:31,- Oh.
00:04:31,00:04:32,- You really see his lung.
00:04:32,00:04:34,- And if he really fancied someone like Jessica Rabbit
00:04:34,00:04:36,"walking past his heart, really."
00:04:36,00:04:39,So I popped out of his chest.
00:04:39,00:04:42,- There was actually a really sad study about which bits
00:04:42,00:04:43,of their lives people would skip.
00:04:43,00:04:45,Like if they could say skip a head five minutes
00:04:45,00:04:47,for about 10 minutes and it found that people would skip
00:04:47,00:04:48,a huge proportion of it.
00:04:48,00:04:51,"Obviously, because most of your life is just drudgery."
00:04:51,00:04:54,"If we could skip to the end of this, guys, we would, wouldn't we?"
00:04:54,00:04:57,"- Well, people listening can just fast-forward to the end."
00:04:57,00:04:58,(laughing)
00:04:58,00:04:59,- If only we could.
00:04:59,00:05:02,- Accessory breasts.
00:05:02,00:05:03,That's another thing.
00:05:03,00:05:04,- Accessory.
00:05:04,00:05:06,"- Okay, so you know the classic total recall"
00:05:06,00:05:10,"three-booped lady, three boobs is a thing."
00:05:10,00:05:13,"But like Andy's saying, you might not know where to find it."
00:05:13,00:05:16,"So it's quite possible that you have three lactating breasts,"
00:05:16,00:05:20,"but in the image that I saw, which to be fair, was a drawing,"
00:05:20,00:05:22,a lady was breastfeeding her child
00:05:22,00:05:25,and then five feeding her other child
00:05:25,00:05:27,because the breast had creased.
00:05:27,00:05:28,- Was this something real?
00:05:28,00:05:29,- Yes.
00:05:29,00:05:30,- This is it from what are your mangoes?
00:05:30,00:05:33,(laughing)
00:05:33,00:05:39,- Herodic mango is unparalleled in this hemisphere.
00:05:39,00:05:43,- Same Jerome was a famous translator.
00:05:43,00:05:44,- Really?
00:05:44,00:05:46,- Not through like audio.
00:05:46,00:05:50,He translated the Bible into the Vulgate.
00:05:50,00:05:54,And what he did was he took the sort of Hebrew Bible
00:05:54,00:05:56,and then he put it into Latin.
00:05:56,00:05:58,But he put it into a way that everyone could understand.
00:05:58,00:06:00,So he changed some of the words that maybe you shouldn't have done.
00:06:00,00:06:05,"So there was a, in fact a Greek word, which was maskia,"
00:06:05,00:06:08,which meant like Messiah.
00:06:08,00:06:11,"And he changed it to Christos, meaning anointed."
00:06:11,00:06:15,But actually the more reasonable way of translating that
00:06:15,00:06:18,"would be 'unctus', meaning anointed."
00:06:18,00:06:20,"And that is why we call Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ"
00:06:20,00:06:22,because of that translation.
00:06:22,00:06:25,"- Oh wow, so we should call him 'unctus'."
00:06:25,00:06:26,- Jesus-unct.
00:06:26,00:06:27,"- Jesus-unct, yeah."
00:06:27,00:06:32,'Buntiano Ronaldo' should be like anyone called Christian
00:06:32,00:06:34,or anything like that should be 'uncty' under at least.
00:06:34,00:06:37,"- He is quite an oily man right now, exactly."
00:06:37,00:06:40,But it's not amazing like one little bit of translation
00:06:40,00:06:42,can change so much in history.
00:06:42,00:06:44,"- Yeah, when we get Christopher from as well, isn't it?"
00:06:44,00:06:45,"- Yeah, Christian, everything."
00:06:45,00:06:47,"- So 'unct', 'unct', 'unct', for example. - Oh."
00:06:47,00:06:49,(laughing)
00:06:49,00:06:51,"- The untuffer, untuffer. - Yeah."
00:06:51,00:06:52,(laughing)
00:06:52,00:06:56,"- The only thing I know about St. Jerome is that he apparently told,"
00:06:56,00:06:59,"I think this is in the realms of maybe, tree, maybe not, tree."
00:06:59,00:07:03,He told nuns not to eat beans because he thought the flatulence
00:07:03,00:07:07,that they would produce is so close to the...
00:07:07,00:07:09,"- Stainerist, dangerous, theorotic."
00:07:09,00:07:12,- That they might induce orgasms accidentally
00:07:12,00:07:14,off the tickling sensation of the fart.
00:07:14,00:07:18,"So he said, ""Tony beans nuns."""
00:07:18,00:07:20,And went back to translating the Bible.
00:07:20,00:07:22,(laughing)
00:07:22,00:07:25,- There's a story told by John Sessions on QI
00:07:25,00:07:27,"in one of the early series that you guys might remember,"
00:07:27,00:07:29,which I always love.
00:07:29,00:07:31,"And I actually don't like, I think his author,"
00:07:31,00:07:32,but he's been told by someone else.
00:07:32,00:07:34,He was told by Gandhi himself probably.
00:07:34,00:07:39,"That was what I'm assuming, but basically in the scene,"
00:07:39,00:07:41,"so there are 300,000 extras, as you say,"
00:07:41,00:07:43,and Richard Attenborough's the director.
00:07:43,00:07:46,And the person who's organizing all the extras
00:07:46,00:07:48,"in the whole scene is this other guy called David Tomlin,"
00:07:48,00:07:51,who's overseeing this funeral scene.
00:07:51,00:07:54,"So Gandhi's just died, and Attenborough says to Tomlin,"
00:07:54,00:07:58,"you've got to tell these 300,000 extras how they're gonna behave."
00:07:58,00:08:01,"And Gandhi's just died their hero,"
00:08:01,00:08:03,like the ultimate icon of their country.
00:08:03,00:08:05,This is the worst news they've ever heard.
00:08:05,00:08:07,"They're devastated, their lives have fallen apart"
00:08:07,00:08:08,from all the ray eyes.
00:08:08,00:08:12,Can you possibly convey to them how they have to act?
00:08:12,00:08:14,"So David Tomlin just turned down to this crowd and said,"
00:08:14,00:08:17,"""Right, listen up, Gandhi's dead, and you're all fucking sad."""
00:08:17,00:08:20,(laughing)
00:08:20,00:08:23,"- Wow, that was very good."
00:08:23,00:08:24,"- So there are three bridges now, I think,"
00:08:24,00:08:28,spanning the boss for us and built it various different times.
00:08:28,00:08:32,"But the 1973 one, the first one was the game changer."
00:08:32,00:08:36,"In 1960s, you had to wait two and a half hours to cross,"
00:08:36,00:08:39,"I think by car, but it was just so clogged."
00:08:39,00:08:42,"And then for vans and lorries, it was days you had to wait to cross,"
00:08:42,00:08:44,"on by boat, before the bridge had happened."
00:08:44,00:08:45,- Oh yeah.
00:08:45,00:08:48,"- And I listened to this amazing interview with Harvey Binney,"
00:08:48,00:08:50,"who is one of the architects, British guy."
00:08:50,00:08:52,"He's retired now, obviously, because it was a long time ago."
00:08:52,00:08:54,"And he was interviewed by the BBC,"
00:08:54,00:08:56,and here's a good riddle of me this.
00:08:56,00:08:57,"- Oh, okay, come on."
00:08:57,00:09:01,"- The distance between the tops of the two towers,"
00:09:01,00:09:02,'cause this is a suspension bridge.
00:09:02,00:09:05,"It's got two towers spanning a little bit,"
00:09:05,00:09:07,is different at the top and at the bottom.
00:09:07,00:09:09,- Riddle me this.
00:09:09,00:09:11,"- Sorry, so as a new take the top,"
00:09:11,00:09:13,and then you go straight down that pole to the bottom.
00:09:13,00:09:15,- Those towers are not straight.
00:09:15,00:09:17,"- Well, they are straight."
00:09:17,00:09:18,"- Oh, is it the curvature of the earth?"
00:09:18,00:09:20,- The earth is not straight.
00:09:20,00:09:21,"- That was right, what I said."
00:09:21,00:09:22,"- Yeah, okay."
00:09:22,00:09:25,"- Because they had to build both towers absolutely straight,"
00:09:25,00:09:27,"but it's such a distance apart,"
00:09:27,00:09:28,"that if you build them both straight,"
00:09:28,00:09:30,the curvature of the earth comes in a way.
00:09:30,00:09:32,And it's about 10 centimeters different at the top.
00:09:32,00:09:33,- Who's it?
00:09:33,00:09:34,"- We did have to take that into account,"
00:09:34,00:09:38,because you don't want to end up with 10 centimeters of cable.
00:09:38,00:09:40,- Can you get to the other one?
00:09:40,00:09:41,"- It's long, but it's not that long."
00:09:41,00:09:43,"- The earth doesn't feel that curved, does it?"
00:09:43,00:09:45,"- I know, the earth is more curved than you'd think."
00:09:45,00:09:48,- The earth is a lot more curved than dumb things.
00:09:48,00:09:49,- Oh yeah.
00:09:49,00:09:52,(all laughing)
00:09:52,00:09:54,"- Oh, me too, okay, now on the go."
00:09:54,00:09:56,- We're just constantly losing giant containers
00:09:56,00:09:57,off the back of ships.
00:09:57,00:09:58,- Why don't I pick it?
00:09:58,00:10:00,You'd want to fish them out as you was in each one.
00:10:00,00:10:01,"- You would, right?"
00:10:01,00:10:01,"- You could be a container of baked beans,"
00:10:01,00:10:03,a container of barbies.
00:10:03,00:10:06,- That is a fun format for a TV show.
00:10:06,00:10:07,"- How does it work, sorry?"
00:10:07,00:10:08,- They already do this.
00:10:08,00:10:10,"- Well, it's a team of celebrities."
00:10:10,00:10:13,"- But there is one of these that exists,"
00:10:13,00:10:14,"but it's on land, right?"
00:10:14,00:10:16,Where you go into containers and you open them up.
00:10:16,00:10:17,"- That's it, it's an American show."
00:10:17,00:10:19,And you take an all-containing unit
00:10:19,00:10:22,"that's not being claimed, or it's run out,"
00:10:22,00:10:24,and they haven't paid their rent and so on.
00:10:24,00:10:24,"- Yeah, that doesn't, that doesn't,"
00:10:24,00:10:25,I don't love this show.
00:10:25,00:10:27,"- And a load of experts can look inside,"
00:10:27,00:10:28,"but they can't, they can't go in,"
00:10:28,00:10:29,they can't open anything up.
00:10:29,00:10:31,"So you just have to bid an amount for it,"
00:10:31,00:10:34,"based on what, you know, what is it called?"
00:10:34,00:10:36,"- Nothing wrong with liking a really good show, you know?"
00:10:36,00:10:38,"As a storage wall, storage wall."
00:10:38,00:10:40,- Can I just say if the producers of storage was
00:10:40,00:10:43,"our listening and they want a celebrity to come on,"
00:10:43,00:10:44,then Dan is available.
00:10:44,00:10:45,- I am available.
00:10:45,00:10:46,"- It's my house, isn't it?"
00:10:46,00:10:47,I'll send you in this little rowing boat
00:10:47,00:10:50,to the middle of the Pacific Ocean to find a container.
00:10:50,00:10:53,- The thing about heartbeats is
00:10:53,00:10:57,some people can hear their own heartbeats better than others.
00:10:57,00:10:59,And this is called empty reception.
00:10:59,00:11:02,And it's the ability to interpret signals
00:11:02,00:11:03,from inside your body.
00:11:03,00:11:06,- I'm so hoping you don't say this means
00:11:06,00:11:07,"I'm going to die prematurely,"
00:11:07,00:11:09,because I hear my heartbeats so loudly all the time.
00:11:09,00:11:13,- You're more likely to report having anxiety
00:11:13,00:11:16,"if you do that, and you're more likely to,"
00:11:16,00:11:18,"if your heartbeats changes slightly,"
00:11:18,00:11:20,"to think it's something to be worried about,"
00:11:20,00:11:22,"whereas actually normally,"
00:11:22,00:11:24,people's heartbeats do change quite a lot throughout
00:11:24,00:11:25,the cost of a day.
00:11:25,00:11:29,"And actually the best thing is to have a medium,"
00:11:29,00:11:30,"you want to sometimes hear it a little bit,"
00:11:30,00:11:33,"but not be obsessed with it, basically."
00:11:33,00:11:36,"- So are you concerned about it sometimes, Anna?"
00:11:36,00:11:37,"- No, I don't get concerned."
00:11:37,00:11:38,"It keeps me awake sometimes,"
00:11:38,00:11:39,"'cause you lie down on your pillow,"
00:11:39,00:11:40,you can always hear it in your ear.
00:11:40,00:11:41,"- So do you hear it internally,"
00:11:41,00:11:43,or can you hear it outwardly?
00:11:43,00:11:44,"- Hear it out, what, like,"
00:11:44,00:11:46,hear it pretty much gets my shoulder hurt.
00:11:46,00:11:47,"- Yeah, can you, no."
00:11:47,00:11:48,"That's physically, I mean,"
00:11:48,00:11:49,can you hear the noise?
00:11:49,00:11:51,"- You're not a cartoon character, aren't you?"
00:11:51,00:11:53,"Could your husband hear the noise,"
00:11:53,00:11:55,or is it through your inner ear?
00:11:55,00:11:56,"- I've never asked him,"
00:11:56,00:11:58,but I snore so loudly that I think it would cover
00:11:58,00:12:00,"your like the, you know, the telltale heart"
00:12:00,00:12:01,by a gorilla heart.
00:12:01,00:12:02,- Oh yeah.
00:12:02,00:12:04,"- You're like that, your whole life."
00:12:04,00:12:05,- I am.
00:12:05,00:12:06,"Hang on, what is the heart tell?"
00:12:06,00:12:07,It beats it so much.
00:12:07,00:12:08,- It's he's murdered somewhere.
00:12:08,00:12:10,"- He's murdered, he's murdered the old man."
00:12:10,00:12:10,"Oh, it happens right away."
00:12:10,00:12:12,"It's sort of straight away,"
00:12:12,00:12:13,"he kills the old man,"
00:12:13,00:12:15,'cause he's got this weird eye.
00:12:15,00:12:16,"The old man has a weird eye,"
00:12:16,00:12:17,"the guy hates that this old man has this weird eye,"
00:12:17,00:12:19,"and he gets obsessed with it,"
00:12:19,00:12:20,"and he decides, well, I'm not gonna have to kill the old man,"
00:12:20,00:12:22,"but I mean, I think I just live in the same building"
00:12:22,00:12:25,"or something, it's always his landlord or something,"
00:12:25,00:12:27,but he kills him.
00:12:27,00:12:29,"And then he buries one of the floorboards,"
00:12:29,00:12:31,"and he keeps hearing his heart beat,"
00:12:31,00:12:32,and some people come around to investigate.
00:12:32,00:12:34,We've heard there's been an old man murdered.
00:12:34,00:12:35,"- Boom, boom."
00:12:35,00:12:36,"- And yeah, boom, boom."
00:12:36,00:12:37,"He's like, can you not hear that?"
00:12:37,00:12:38,"- No, I don't know."
00:12:38,00:12:38,"- No, I was gonna hear it."
00:12:38,00:12:41,(laughing)
00:12:41,00:12:42,"- I was actually looking up,"
00:12:42,00:12:45,"'cause I was thinking I like eel in Japanese restaurants,"
00:12:45,00:12:46,"which is the only context I've really had it,"
00:12:46,00:12:48,but obviously it used to be a huge thing.
00:12:48,00:12:50,It was mostly in London and Cockney's
00:12:50,00:12:52,"and everyone ate jelly deal, right?"
00:12:52,00:12:54,"You'd have pie, mash, and eel shops, or whatever."
00:12:54,00:12:55,- That's right.
00:12:55,00:12:58,"- I was wondering, was it nice?"
00:12:58,00:13:01,"And honestly, I've been through so many forums"
00:13:01,00:13:02,where people were reminiscing about using it
00:13:02,00:13:06,and not a single person has said it wasn't disgusting.
00:13:06,00:13:08,"- And that's presumably, if you're posting on those forums,"
00:13:08,00:13:10,you're kind of nostalgic or buffer.
00:13:10,00:13:11,- Exactly.
00:13:11,00:13:13,- I would think is the prime territory.
00:13:13,00:13:13,"- You're desperate to say,"
00:13:13,00:13:15,"""Oh, it was better in the good old days."""
00:13:15,00:13:17,(laughing)
00:13:17,00:13:19,"- It was rank, I thought."
00:13:19,00:13:22,"After Brexit, I thought we were gonna get it back."
00:13:22,00:13:23,- Did you?
00:13:23,00:13:24,"- Yeah, that was the Sunlit Uplands"
00:13:24,00:13:25,that I was looking for.
00:13:25,00:13:26,"- That's what you voted for, wasn't it?"
00:13:26,00:13:27,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:13:27,00:13:28,- Prick that the jelly deal.
00:13:28,00:13:31,"- No, actually Brexit has stuffed the eel thing."
00:13:31,00:13:31,"- Oh, no."
00:13:31,00:13:33,"- I'm so sorry, it has."
00:13:33,00:13:34,- Wasted voters.
00:13:34,00:13:38,- I'm sure you guys are familiar with the Sustainable eel group.
00:13:38,00:13:41,"Basically, we used to ship 10 million eels a year to Europe."
00:13:41,00:13:43,"Legally, this isn't traffic."
00:13:43,00:13:45,And more than half of that was for rewilding.
00:13:45,00:13:47,"'Cause if you get an eel swimming into the Seven Astray,"
00:13:47,00:13:48,"it's screwed, right?"
00:13:48,00:13:50,"It's like, it can't get up the Seven Astray"
00:13:50,00:13:51,to a spawning ground.
00:13:51,00:13:52,The river is too blocked up.
00:13:52,00:13:54,But there are loads of places in Europe
00:13:54,00:13:56,where you can introduce Neil.
00:13:56,00:13:59,"It'll swim up, it'll find a cracking place to spawn, whatever."
00:13:59,00:14:01,And you've done a great job there.
00:14:01,00:14:02,But Brexit has ruined it.
00:14:02,00:14:04,- 'Cause they can't fill in the paperwork and stuff.
00:14:04,00:14:05,- It's good.
00:14:05,00:14:07,"- Yeah, they can't fill in the paperwork."
00:14:07,00:14:09,But it basically tried barriers.
00:14:09,00:14:11,"- Yeah, it's a bit of a pain."
00:14:11,00:14:13,"- Does your heart really go blah, blah, blah?"
00:14:13,00:14:14,"Does it just go blah, blah?"
00:14:14,00:14:16,"And you've just heard the blah, blah, blah in movies."
00:14:16,00:14:17,- Or is it an echo?
00:14:17,00:14:18,Is the--
00:14:18,00:14:19,"- Oh, oh."
00:14:19,00:14:20,- If you've got a very hollow body.
00:14:20,00:14:21,(laughing)
00:14:21,00:14:22,- Yeah.
00:14:22,00:14:23,- The hollow head.
00:14:23,00:14:24,- I'm just testing now.
00:14:24,00:14:25,"- It does go blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
00:14:25,00:14:26,- Does it?
00:14:26,00:14:27,"- Sometimes I'm only using really hard, I think."
00:14:27,00:14:28,"- I can only hear the, at the moment,"
00:14:28,00:14:29,I can only hear the boom.
00:14:29,00:14:30,- Yeah.
00:14:30,00:14:32,"- Well, you're using your pulse."
00:14:32,00:14:33,- Yeah.
00:14:33,00:14:34,- You're not listening to your--
00:14:34,00:14:35,"- But it's like, for instance, if you listen--"
00:14:35,00:14:37,"- But what do you think the, what do you think the heart is?"
00:14:37,00:14:39,"- Well, I think the heart, I, the boom,"
00:14:39,00:14:41,"I associate with heart, not with my pulse."
00:14:41,00:14:43,"I know that you can feel the pulse,"
00:14:43,00:14:45,"but you can't say, oh, I can hear my heart"
00:14:45,00:14:47,by touching your veins on your wrist.
00:14:47,00:14:47,- Yeah.
00:14:47,00:14:49,"- It's like, this is all got a bit stoner,"
00:14:49,00:14:50,but go on James.
00:14:50,00:14:54,"- Right back, well, I doubt I will, but it's like with a clock, you know,"
00:14:54,00:14:56,"clock ticks, but it doesn't talk."
00:14:56,00:14:59,"It just goes tick, tick, tick, because it's the same mechanism"
00:14:59,00:15:01,doing it all the time.
00:15:01,00:15:03,"But if you're, if you listen to it, you can almost hear a talk"
00:15:03,00:15:05,even though there's not one there because you're expecting it.
00:15:05,00:15:07,"- I was playing it cool by agreeing with you,"
00:15:07,00:15:09,but I absolutely thought there was a talk.
00:15:09,00:15:11,- Go in every clock.
00:15:11,00:15:13,"They'd entered two different tones, just before."
00:15:13,00:15:16,"- I thought the pendulum, yeah, I assumed for years and years"
00:15:16,00:15:18,"when the pendulum goes one way, that makes a tick sound."
00:15:18,00:15:21,"And then, I don't know, inside the glass cabinet, there's something"
00:15:21,00:15:24,which makes it sound a bit different going the other way.
00:15:24,00:15:26,- It's weird that you still got that pendulum watch.
00:15:26,00:15:28,"- There is a different kind of eel,"
00:15:28,00:15:29,which does a similar-ish thing.
00:15:29,00:15:31,It's called a snake eel.
00:15:31,00:15:35,And they have a very pointy tip on their tail.
00:15:35,00:15:37,And they use it in a slightly different way.
00:15:37,00:15:40,"They use it just to power out of the stomach of the fish,"
00:15:40,00:15:41,which has eaten the sideways.
00:15:41,00:15:43,"I mean, they just go out of the stomach."
00:15:43,00:15:44,"- Oh, like here's it."
00:15:44,00:15:45,- They just pierce it.
00:15:45,00:15:46,They just go through.
00:15:46,00:15:47,"- Well, that sounds not very good for the fish."
00:15:47,00:15:49,"It's not good for anyone, because they can't get through"
00:15:49,00:15:51,the ribcage once they're through the stomach.
00:15:51,00:15:53,So they just end up stuck in there.
00:15:53,00:15:55,- That's like a blooper from the alien movies.
00:15:55,00:15:57,(laughing)
00:15:57,00:16:00,"The alien's like, ""I'm stuck, we're gonna have to do this again."""
00:16:00,00:16:02,"- Yeah, and the fish doesn't even notice."
00:16:02,00:16:06,Fish can cope with a lot of stuff.
00:16:06,00:16:08,- Something piercing a big hole in its stomach
00:16:08,00:16:10,and then landing up squirming around at its ribcage.
00:16:10,00:16:11,"- Okay, I don't know whether they don't notice,"
00:16:11,00:16:14,but they definitely don't take any action.
00:16:14,00:16:15,- They play cool.
00:16:15,00:16:16,- They play cool.
00:16:16,00:16:17,"- Yeah, good on 'em."
00:16:17,00:16:20,"- Oh, if you eat muscles as a human,"
00:16:20,00:16:22,you put them in the pot and it's boiling water.
00:16:22,00:16:23,"- They often come back out, don't they?"
00:16:23,00:16:24,"- Oh, okay."
00:16:24,00:16:25,- Pricing onto it.
00:16:25,00:16:27,- But you're not supposed to eat the clothes ones
00:16:27,00:16:28,'cause they might come out.
00:16:28,00:16:29,- Yeah.
00:16:29,00:16:30,"- Well, that is actually true if you're a sea an enemy."
00:16:30,00:16:33,"If you eat a muscle and it's closed,"
00:16:33,00:16:35,then the muscle can just go through your body
00:16:35,00:16:37,and come out the other end and the muscle will still be fine.
00:16:37,00:16:39,"- Oh, really?"
00:16:39,00:16:39,- Yeah.
00:16:39,00:16:41,Whereas normally what they'll do
00:16:41,00:16:43,is they'll bring in the muscle and the shell
00:16:43,00:16:45,"and then they'll eat the muscle and eject the shell,"
00:16:45,00:16:47,"but if it's closed, they can't get us"
00:16:47,00:16:47,to the muscle.
00:16:47,00:16:50,- Do the enemies and enemies eat the whole thing
00:16:50,00:16:52,and then to sort it out inside?
00:16:52,00:16:54,"'Cause that's a more dignified way of eating, I think."
00:16:54,00:16:55,- Yeah.
00:16:55,00:16:57,"- Now, if you could do that with a lobster."
00:16:57,00:16:58,- If you could do that with a big mac
00:16:58,00:17:03,and you put in the entire burger and the plastic
00:17:03,00:17:04,that goes round it.
00:17:04,00:17:05,- With a plastic on the trees.
00:17:05,00:17:07,"- Oh, if you could, yeah."
00:17:07,00:17:08,(laughing)
00:17:08,00:17:11,- Or if you could do it with a kinder egg
00:17:11,00:17:12,and then you could eat the whole thing
00:17:12,00:17:14,and you could even make the tie inside you.
00:17:14,00:17:15,- I love that.
00:17:15,00:17:16,(laughing)
00:17:16,00:17:18,- There's a little mechanical women on those.
00:17:18,00:17:20,(laughing)
00:17:20,00:17:23,50% of eel consumed on the planet is eaten in Japan.
00:17:23,00:17:24,- It's big.
00:17:24,00:17:25,"- And if you go to a Japanese restaurant,"
00:17:25,00:17:28,"they'll always have, they have eel on the menu."
00:17:28,00:17:32,But the nice news is that 35% of Japanese people
00:17:32,00:17:33,are willing to eat cultured eel.
00:17:33,00:17:35,- What eel that goes to the theatre?
00:17:35,00:17:36,- That's right.
00:17:36,00:17:37,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:17:37,00:17:38,It costs more because obviously you've seen the price
00:17:38,00:17:39,of the restaurant these days.
00:17:39,00:17:42,(laughing)
00:17:42,00:17:43,"- No, you can't."
00:17:43,00:17:46,"It's saturated laden is, it light Hamilton."
00:17:46,00:17:47,It doesn't love it.
00:17:47,00:17:48,It wasn't five stars.
00:17:48,00:17:52,"But no, it's like, you can grow really good eel now."
00:17:52,00:17:53,"You know, the art of it, like growing meats"
00:17:53,00:17:55,which are of different varieties.
00:17:55,00:17:57,"The eel you can get now is really, really nice."
00:17:57,00:17:58,- We're at like fake eel.
00:17:58,00:17:58,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:17:58,00:17:59,"- Oh, really?"
00:17:59,00:18:01,"- It looks like it, it tastes like it, all of that, you know?"
00:18:01,00:18:03,So that might be quite good.
00:18:03,00:18:05,- And how many Japanese people are willing to eat that?
00:18:05,00:18:05,- Over a third.
00:18:05,00:18:07,- That's good figures.
00:18:07,00:18:08,"That's much better than like,"
00:18:08,00:18:10,proportions of American people who are willing to eat fake meat.
00:18:10,00:18:11,I suspect cultured meat.
00:18:11,00:18:13,"- Yeah, but we all say we're willing to eat kangaroo"
00:18:13,00:18:15,testicles until we're actually on.
00:18:15,00:18:16,"I'm a celebrity, give me out here."
00:18:16,00:18:17,(laughing)
00:18:17,00:18:18,"And then, you know what I'm saying?"
00:18:18,00:18:19,- You're right.
00:18:19,00:18:20,- You're right.
00:18:20,00:18:24,- Alfred Hitchcock was terrified of eggs had over phobia.
00:18:24,00:18:28,"So he said, the white round thing without any holes."
00:18:28,00:18:29,That's how we refer it to eggs.
00:18:29,00:18:32,"And when you break it inside, there's that yellow thing"
00:18:32,00:18:35,round without any holes.
00:18:35,00:18:38,So I think he likes holes and he doesn't like eggs.
00:18:38,00:18:40,- Did he like ping pong balls?
00:18:40,00:18:41,"- Yeah, I don't know."
00:18:41,00:18:42,"He's no mention on ping pong balls,"
00:18:42,00:18:44,but what's interesting is his favorite breakfast
00:18:44,00:18:47,was quiche Lorraine and he used to make it himself.
00:18:47,00:18:48,- What?
00:18:48,00:18:50,"- Yeah, so he would have to deal with his phobia"
00:18:50,00:18:53,until the egg no longer resembled an egg.
00:18:53,00:18:54,And then he was fine with it.
00:18:54,00:18:55,- Stick hole in it.
00:18:55,00:18:56,"- Stick hole in it, yeah."
00:18:56,00:18:58,"- So that says to me, wasn't that serious?"
00:18:58,00:19:00,Was it if he's still making his own quiche Lorraine?
00:19:00,00:19:03,"- No, 'cause I think it's a sort of,"
00:19:03,00:19:05,you face your fears and then it goes quite quickly
00:19:05,00:19:06,once you get the fear.
00:19:06,00:19:08,For him it was the shape and the lack of hole.
00:19:08,00:19:09,"- No, no, I know, but if I like,"
00:19:09,00:19:10,I don't like a house spider.
00:19:10,00:19:14,And I can't just like go and kill a house spider really fast
00:19:14,00:19:15,"and be like, well, it was really quick,"
00:19:15,00:19:15,so it doesn't matter.
00:19:15,00:19:16,"- I see, yeah."
00:19:16,00:19:17,- 'Cause I can't go near it.
00:19:17,00:19:19,- The other day I met a house spider fell on me
00:19:19,00:19:23,as I was sitting up in bed from the ceiling.
00:19:23,00:19:23,"And it was, it was a bit--"
00:19:23,00:19:25,- It told me this before I didn't enjoy the story
00:19:25,00:19:26,"at the time, I'm not enjoying it now."
00:19:26,00:19:27,- It was a four-incher.
00:19:27,00:19:28,- I don't like it.
00:19:28,00:19:29,- And I was shirtless.
00:19:29,00:19:31,- That's not four-inchers for you.
00:19:31,00:19:34,(all laughing)
00:19:34,00:19:36,"- So low-albender, right?"
00:19:36,00:19:37,"If you haven't already covered this,"
00:19:37,00:19:39,I'd like you to know that some US banks
00:19:39,00:19:41,have their own zip code.
00:19:41,00:19:42,"- Oh, nice."
00:19:42,00:19:43,"- It's cool, isn't it?"
00:19:43,00:19:43,- Okay.
00:19:43,00:19:45,"- And then they write, I came across this"
00:19:45,00:19:48,"because for reasons unknown to me, meetup.com"
00:19:48,00:19:50,defaulted to that zip code.
00:19:50,00:19:52,But I'm in and then they give their own zip code.
00:19:52,00:19:53,(all laughing)
00:19:53,00:19:54,- Which is?
00:19:54,00:19:57,"- Well, I think this might be a call for help, really."
00:19:57,00:19:57,- Yeah.
00:19:57,00:19:59,- What's meetup.com?
00:19:59,00:20:01,"- Well, it sounds like a dating site."
00:20:01,00:20:01,"- It does, doesn't it?"
00:20:01,00:20:04,- And it then sounds like he's trying to give his address
00:20:04,00:20:07,"on the podcast, or she, or they."
00:20:07,00:20:11,So I wonder if this is just a trick to try and get some
00:20:11,00:20:12,- Yeah.
00:20:12,00:20:13,- Fistless.
00:20:13,00:20:13,- Three meetups.
00:20:13,00:20:14,- Are we being cat-fished?
00:20:14,00:20:15,- Brilliant.
00:20:15,00:20:16,- Right now.
00:20:16,00:20:17,"- Wait, I'm so confused."
00:20:17,00:20:19,So this person went on a dating site
00:20:19,00:20:22,and ended up accidentally booking in a date with a bank.
00:20:22,00:20:23,(all laughing)
00:20:23,00:20:25,"Went to meet the date, had put misleading pictures up"
00:20:25,00:20:28,"of a not bank, and then arrived in it with a bank."
00:20:28,00:20:29,"- No, it's better."
00:20:29,00:20:30,- Come over and make a deposit.
00:20:30,00:20:32,"I bet the innuendo is going to be,"
00:20:32,00:20:33,what's the safe word?
00:20:33,00:20:34,There we go.
00:20:34,00:20:34,"- Yep, there we go."
00:20:34,00:20:35,"- I'm good, yeah, yeah."
00:20:35,00:20:36,- Put 'em up.
00:20:36,00:20:38,(all laughing)
00:20:38,00:20:39,- This is a stick-up.
00:20:39,00:20:42,(all laughing)
00:20:42,00:20:45,"- I make the same mistake every week when we do this,"
00:20:45,00:20:46,"and then I go home, and I get sushi"
00:20:46,00:20:48,"for the thing next to the station,"
00:20:48,00:20:49,"you know, which comes with soy sauce and wasabi."
00:20:49,00:20:51,But it's always rammed the train.
00:20:51,00:20:53,"So I squeeze in, and then you have to get the chopsticks out"
00:20:53,00:20:54,"and you have to open the soy sauce,"
00:20:54,00:20:56,and you have to open the soy sauce.
00:20:56,00:20:57,And it goes just everywhere.
00:20:57,00:20:59,"- And you have to ask someone to hold your fingerball,"
00:20:59,00:21:02,"and it's, you had to take your shoes off as well."
00:21:02,00:21:03,It's like that.
00:21:03,00:21:04,"- But you know when you started,"
00:21:04,00:21:05,"you're like, people would think I've given up"
00:21:05,00:21:07,if I don't keep going.
00:21:07,00:21:09,So I'm always covered in soy sauce and it's stink.
00:21:09,00:21:11,- I don't think people think about you that much.
00:21:11,00:21:12,"I don't mean to offend,"
00:21:12,00:21:14,but just most people are busy with their own stuff.
00:21:14,00:21:15,"They're not gonna think that woman's only,"
00:21:15,00:21:18,"""I want to stop eating her sushi half."""
00:21:18,00:21:19,- What's going on?
00:21:19,00:21:19,"- Oh, what?"
00:21:19,00:21:21,- She's the top-podcast that I'm at.
00:21:21,00:21:23,- Shinski eating half a sushi.
00:21:23,00:21:24,(all laughing)
00:21:24,00:21:25,"- She's quit, isn't she?"
00:21:25,00:21:26,She's turned.
00:21:26,00:21:27,That was to finish it.
00:21:27,00:21:29,- Why don't you go and eat the other half?
00:21:29,00:21:31,(all laughing)
00:21:31,00:21:33,- You used to hurt dinner.
00:21:33,00:21:34,"- Oh shit, I missed my start."
00:21:34,00:21:37,(all laughing)
00:21:37,00:21:37,- It was worth it.
00:21:37,00:21:38,- It was worth it.
00:21:38,00:21:43,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:21:43,00:21:44,and that is Andy.
00:21:44,00:21:46,"My fact is that after Chernobyl,"
00:21:46,00:21:48,nearby children were tweeted.
00:21:48,00:21:51,"And they taught, they taught."
00:21:51,00:21:54,We're putting that in there.
00:21:54,00:21:55,- Good.
00:21:55,00:21:58,"- Someone sent us a tweet this morning, actually,"
00:21:58,00:22:01,"Sean Gibson, and it was referring to,"
00:22:01,00:22:04,it's just a headline from the Intelligencie Journal
00:22:04,00:22:06,"in Pennsylvania from 1913,"
00:22:06,00:22:09,Self-Rising Bed exceeds expectations
00:22:09,00:22:11,and throws inventor out of the window.
00:22:11,00:22:13,(all laughing)
00:22:13,00:22:15,No more information given.
00:22:15,00:22:17,"- Brilliant, I need it."
00:22:17,00:22:19,- The thing that you have always done back up since I was tiny
00:22:19,00:22:21,is you drink some water upside down.
00:22:21,00:22:22,"- Yeah, that all of that stuff is rubbish."
00:22:22,00:22:23,"- No, it works."
00:22:23,00:22:24,"- No, it doesn't."
00:22:24,00:22:25,"- It's just a distraction, Tony."
00:22:25,00:22:26,- It's been proven to be all rubbish.
00:22:26,00:22:27,- It works for me.
00:22:27,00:22:28,"- No, it doesn't."
00:22:28,00:22:29,- You're still hiccuping.
00:22:29,00:22:30,(all laughing)
00:22:30,00:22:31,You've been doing it all day.
00:22:31,00:22:32,"- No, not."
00:22:33,00:22:37,- My headline thanks this week is from Jeffrey Partica
00:22:37,00:22:40,or Partica or Parti Car.
00:22:40,00:22:40,"- Partica, yeah."
00:22:40,00:22:42,"- Partica, yeah, it's possible."
00:22:42,00:22:43,"- Remember when we went to Dublin,"
00:22:43,00:22:44,and we got in a Partica.
00:22:44,00:22:45,"- Yeah, that was cool."
00:22:45,00:22:46,- That was cool.
00:22:46,00:22:47,- That was the taxi.
00:22:47,00:22:48,"- Unintentionally, we didn't know."
00:22:48,00:22:48,- I don't remember that.
00:22:48,00:22:50,"- We got a taxi home from a gig,"
00:22:50,00:22:52,"and then the guy just pressed a button,"
00:22:52,00:22:53,"and all the lights start going off,"
00:22:53,00:22:55,"and there's like a disco ball,"
00:22:55,00:22:56,and they started playing music.
00:22:56,00:22:57,"- It just went thundersly disco,"
00:22:57,00:22:59,like-- - They always do that in taxis for me.
00:22:59,00:22:59,- It's very cool.
00:22:59,00:23:00,"- All right, yeah."
00:23:00,00:23:01,- What do you don't remember?
00:23:01,00:23:03,(laughing)
00:23:03,00:23:06,- Electric heels are not a type of heel.
00:23:06,00:23:07,- Are they not?
00:23:07,00:23:08,"- No, they don't seem they were."
00:23:08,00:23:10,- They're just an electric fish that's very long.
00:23:10,00:23:12,But I thought I'd read about them anyway.
00:23:12,00:23:15,"There's this absolutely hero called Ken Catania,"
00:23:15,00:23:18,who's worked out what it feels like to be attacked
00:23:18,00:23:20,"by an electric heel,"
00:23:20,00:23:23,and he says that being attacked by a large electric heel
00:23:23,00:23:26,is like being tazered by nine tazers at the same time.
00:23:26,00:23:29,"- Well, what he did was he stuck his tank arm"
00:23:29,00:23:31,into a tank with a small eel.
00:23:31,00:23:32,"- I did it 10 times,"
00:23:32,00:23:35,and he reckons because he knows how electric heels work.
00:23:35,00:23:37,You could just extrapolate from the small eel
00:23:37,00:23:39,to the size of a normal eel.
00:23:39,00:23:42,"So if you get bitten by a small electric heel,"
00:23:42,00:23:45,it's about the same as touching a horse fence.
00:23:45,00:23:46,- Okay.
00:23:46,00:23:47,- Do you know what that's like?
00:23:47,00:23:48,"- I do, actually, yeah."
00:23:48,00:23:50,"- Yeah, 'cause you like to steal horses, don't you?"
00:23:50,00:23:52,"- I do, I do, I use to raise on the podcast,"
00:23:52,00:23:53,"but yeah, my horse rusted that."
00:23:53,00:23:55,- You've touched an electrified horse fence.
00:23:55,00:23:57,"- Yeah, well, 'cause you know, when you're a kid,"
00:23:57,00:23:57,"we used to line up,"
00:23:57,00:23:58,"so one of you touched the fence,"
00:23:58,00:24:00,"and then everyone holds onto the other one shoulders,"
00:24:00,00:24:01,and then you--
00:24:01,00:24:03,"- Okay, so it's a bit of a shock, it's not a shock."
00:24:03,00:24:04,- It's quite a shock.
00:24:04,00:24:05,"- Hang on, if you're holding it normally,"
00:24:05,00:24:08,does it not shock you at all because you're earthed
00:24:08,00:24:09,with your rubber shoes or other?
00:24:09,00:24:11,"- No, the earth thing is the problem, right?"
00:24:11,00:24:12,'Cause it goes through your body together.
00:24:12,00:24:13,"- Oh, sorry."
00:24:13,00:24:15,- So you're not wearing your big wellies at this point?
00:24:15,00:24:16,"- No, no, the whole point is to shock you"
00:24:16,00:24:17,and your all your friends in a line.
00:24:17,00:24:19,"Anyway, electric heels work."
00:24:19,00:24:21,"He says, but he hasn't actually had the bulls"
00:24:21,00:24:23,to sting himself with a proper big one.
00:24:23,00:24:26,"- No, because actually if you're tazered by nine tazers,"
00:24:26,00:24:27,you have properly get it die.
00:24:27,00:24:28,- Yeah.
00:24:28,00:24:30,"- Oh, good idea, very nice."
00:24:30,00:24:31,(laughing)
00:24:31,00:24:34,- And one interesting thing is that they use their electricity
00:24:34,00:24:37,"for electro-location so they can,"
00:24:37,00:24:40,"a bit like so now, they can kind of fire their electric field"
00:24:40,00:24:42,around and then feel where everything is.
00:24:42,00:24:45,"So 'cause it's so dark and muddy down there,"
00:24:45,00:24:48,and that's how they can see where everything is.
00:24:48,00:24:51,"But the sensors that they use, it's not exactly the same,"
00:24:51,00:24:53,"but it's very, very similar principles"
00:24:53,00:24:55,to how your mobile phone works.
00:24:55,00:24:58,So you know how there's sensors in there
00:24:58,00:25:00,that kind of can tell that your fingers there
00:25:00,00:25:02,"and it's all about capacitors and blah, blah, blah,"
00:25:02,00:25:03,"I'm not gonna go into it now,"
00:25:03,00:25:05,but it's basically the same technology
00:25:05,00:25:07,as electric heels used to find the way around.
00:25:07,00:25:08,- Do you see?
00:25:08,00:25:09,You've got all your clever computers
00:25:09,00:25:11,"and all your internet in the old days,"
00:25:11,00:25:14,we got around just with ill tech.
00:25:14,00:25:16,(laughing)
00:25:16,00:25:17,And we jelly him up at the end of the day.
00:25:17,00:25:20,It was absolutely horrible.
00:25:20,00:25:23,(laughing)
00:25:23,00:25:26,"I was, isn't it weird that when you have a bisectomy"
00:25:26,00:25:27,and then you produce semen?
00:25:27,00:25:29,What would you think that looks like?
00:25:29,00:25:31,"'Cause you know when you think about, you picture semen."
00:25:31,00:25:32,- Yeah.
00:25:32,00:25:33,- And you think that that's--
00:25:33,00:25:34,"- I can't picture anything in my head,"
00:25:34,00:25:37,"but I'm not, not even gonna try this one."
00:25:37,00:25:38,- It probably looks absolutely identical.
00:25:38,00:25:40,"Yeah, maybe, or just a bit more watery."
00:25:40,00:25:43,- That's what I would have thought it looks more watery.
00:25:43,00:25:45,"- It looks like more transparent, maybe."
00:25:45,00:25:47,- Maybe it doesn't have those green bits there.
00:25:47,00:25:48,(laughing)
00:25:48,00:25:49,- It's just...
00:25:49,00:25:51,(laughing)
00:25:52,00:25:53,(laughing)
00:25:53,00:25:55,"- We still got the chunky cheesy bits, right?"
00:25:55,00:25:56,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:25:56,00:25:58,(laughing)
00:25:58,00:26:01,"- It's a different shoe they need to color, James."
00:26:01,00:26:03,"- It's not, it's doesn't sparkle."
00:26:03,00:26:05,(laughing)
00:26:05,00:26:06,"- Well, in a way, it doesn't sparkle."
00:26:06,00:26:07,- It doesn't sink.
00:26:07,00:26:09,It doesn't make that weird singing sound.
00:26:09,00:26:10,(laughing)
00:26:10,00:26:12,- It's not weird.
00:26:12,00:26:15,"- There's some screaming here, so they go."
00:26:15,00:26:15,- Don't do it.
00:26:15,00:26:16,- You're right around.
00:26:16,00:26:18,(laughing)
00:26:18,00:26:19,- I go to Val Halag.
00:26:19,00:26:22,- We'll fight them on the beach.
00:26:22,00:26:23,"- So Anna, Anna, come on."
00:26:23,00:26:24,"- Tell them more, I wanted to assist his name."
00:26:24,00:26:25,- Where did you want it to go?
00:26:25,00:26:26,- Where?
00:26:26,00:26:28,- 'Cause you want it to go.
