1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,980
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:04,140
 - Hey Club Fish members, how you doing?

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:04,980
 It's Dan here.

4
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,660
 Hope you're well, welcome to your bonus bit of content.

5
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,780
 This is a compilation episode that we have for you today,

6
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,500
 all the best bits that didn't make it into the main episode

7
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,220
 largely 'cause they just didn't fit the narrative.

8
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,500
 So hope you enjoy it, but before we get to it,

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,220

10
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,660

00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:54,620
 Here we go, the best of the bits that didn't make it.

22
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:55,620
 On with the show.

23
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:59,100
 (funky music)

24
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,460
 (funky music)

25
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,120
 (funky music)

26
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:14,660
 Hi everybody, Andy here.

27
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:18,020
 Welcome to an audience fact special episode

28
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,260
 of no such thing as a fish.

29
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:23,260
 You have all been sending your thanks to podcast@QI.com.

30
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,780
 Is that the address?

31
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,600
 - That's the address.

32
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,060
 - I'm gonna say every week, so I hope so.

33
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,200
 - Well, they've been getting through

34
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,560
 and they've been coming in second first.

35
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,160
 And we've creamed off the ones on the top

36
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,400
 and we're gonna be reading them out

37
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,200
 and sharing them back with you.

38
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,800
 - It's harder than it looks, isn't it Andy?

39
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,740
 - It's a very difficult job.

40
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,840
 - Damn, this is amazing.

41
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,800
 Mother of the year.

42
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,380
 - Do you wanna mention who else is here?

43
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,680
 - Where are we as well?

44
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,360
 And how often does this podcast go out?

45
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,020
 - God.

46
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,300
 - Can I tell you one last thing about the boss for us?

47
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,140
 - Yeah.

48
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,020
 I was standing to an opal and how it was defended.

49
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,500
 There's one weakness in a naval sense.

50
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,100
 There's a waterway which is calm and navigable.

51
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,660
 And basically, if you could sail your ships in there.

52
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,740
 - Oh, like a harbour.

53
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,940
 - Yeah, you could invade.

54
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,660
 And it would be incredibly easy to invade.

55
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,900
 So how did Constantinople, as it was then,

56
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,860
 solve this problem?

57
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,180
 - Cannons.

58
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,580
 - Great idea.

59
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,580
 Arguably better than what they came up with.

60
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,020
 - Look at dials.

61
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,220
 - Look at those, good call.

62
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,060
 - That's good.

63
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,820
 - What do you do about the chain of the golden horn?

64
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,660
 - Okay.

65
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,500
 - They had a massive chain just across the water.

66
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,340
 - Yep.

67
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,660
 - Like a rope barrier outside of nightclub.

68
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,540
 - Oh, you did this work though.

69
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,180
 - Even to actually, I'm being unfair.

70
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,500
 It worked better than you'd think it would.

71
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,940
 It's about half a mile long.

72
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,540
 Just this huge chain across the water

73
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,100
 and then they can lower it if someone approaches

74
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,620
 who's friendly and then what?

75
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,460
 - You can get up again.

76
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,780
 - There were quite common those things, I think.

77
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,620
 - Okay.

78
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,300
 - Yeah, I've heard of them before.

79
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,980
 - I heard of one, this is in like British history

80
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,300
 but there was one of them somewhere where someone was in a boat

81
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,340
 and they went in the boat towards this chain

82
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,660
 and they're gonna hit it and what happened was everyone

83
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,420
 on the boat ran to the back of the boat

84
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,340
 so it lifted the front of it, so they went over it

85
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,900
 and then everyone ran to the front.

86
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,740
 - Exactly.

87
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,380
 - So all you know, that's like a hurrieder to story

88
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,380
 if I ever heard of one.

89
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,980
 - I think it is a story, like Harman were it's from.

90
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:15,820
 - Good.

91
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,660
 - That's great.

92
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,220
 - There was a report in Scientific American in 1858

93
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,660
 about a healthy person called Mr. Groove

94
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,860
 but he was born without a sternum or a breastbone

95
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,820
 and so you could see completely clearly his heart

96
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,660
 and part of his lungs, so it was just a thin layer

97
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,900
 of skin around it.

98
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,620
 And so he'd be exhibited in theatres around Europe

99
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,980
 for a few years in intellectuals

100
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,700
 because it really helped doctors know

101
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,820
 about the structure of the heart and how it beat

102
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,140
 'cause he'd literally stand at the front of a lecture hall

103
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,460
 and you'd be sitting at the back

104
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,620
 and you could see his heart bum bumming,

105
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,580
 bouncing out of his chest.

106
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,500
 - 'Cause he didn't grow properly.

107
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,660
 He was--

108
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,500
 - Wow, good stuff.

109
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,340
 - Wow.

110
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,660
 - It wasn't grew the name of the guy from this pickable me.

111
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,500
 - Yeah.

112
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,300
 - So did he have this and then he thought he was so exceptional

113
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,540
 that he decided to take over the world with his minions.

114
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,660
 - And that's what that's based on.

115
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,500
 - Yes.

116
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,340
 - There we go.

117
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,500
 - Did he have ribs?

118
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,020
 - And if so, where did they meet?

119
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,020
 - I think maybe the ribs didn't meet, no breastbone.

120
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,380
 - It feels like they wouldn't meet.

121
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,220
 - Yeah.

122
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,060
 - They just sort of stop.

123
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:15,900
 - Big holes.

124
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,740
 - Big holes.

125
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,580
 - Big holes.

126
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,380
 - He had muscles between your ribs, so he would stay in place.

127
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,220
 - Right.

128
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,060
 - Yeah.

129
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,180
 - It wouldn't be good like my daughter likes to jump on my chest.

130
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,180
 That wouldn't be good.

131
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,020
 - Oh, yeah.

132
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:26,860
 - I'll start them at that.

133
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,700
 - Yeah.

134
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,460
 - And if he coughed or sneeze, then there's long,

135
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,860
 really bounced out of his chest.

136
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,700
 - Oh.

137
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,540
 - You really see his lung.

138
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,980
 - And if he really fancied someone like Jessica Rabbit

139
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,700
 walking past his heart, really.

140
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,100
 So I popped out of his chest.

141
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,220
 - There was actually a really sad study about which bits

142
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,300
 of their lives people would skip.

143
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,020
 Like if they could say skip a head five minutes

144
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,220
 for about 10 minutes and it found that people would skip

145
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,900
 a huge proportion of it.

146
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,700
 Obviously, because most of your life is just drudgery.

147
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,980
 If we could skip to the end of this, guys, we would, wouldn't we?

148
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,380
 - Well, people listening can just fast-forward to the end.

149
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,380
 (laughing)

150
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,380
 - If only we could.

151
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,620
 - Accessory breasts.

152
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,460
 That's another thing.

153
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,300
 - Accessory.

154
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,740
 - Okay, so you know the classic total recall

155
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,420
 three-booped lady, three boobs is a thing.

156
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,220
 But like Andy's saying, you might not know where to find it.

157
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,900
 So it's quite possible that you have three lactating breasts,

158
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,500
 but in the image that I saw, which to be fair, was a drawing,

159
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,140
 a lady was breastfeeding her child

160
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:25,100
 and then five feeding her other child

161
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,020
 because the breast had creased.

162
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,340
 - Was this something real?

163
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,180
 - Yes.

164
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,900
 - This is it from what are your mangoes?

165
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,500
 (laughing)

166
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:39,060
 - Herodic mango is unparalleled in this hemisphere.

167
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,780
 - Same Jerome was a famous translator.

168
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,780
 - Really?

169
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,500
 - Not through like audio.

170
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,180
 He translated the Bible into the Vulgate.

171
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:54,140
 And what he did was he took the sort of Hebrew Bible

172
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,020
 and then he put it into Latin.

173
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,100
 But he put it into a way that everyone could understand.

174
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,900
 So he changed some of the words that maybe you shouldn't have done.

175
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:05,900
 So there was a, in fact a Greek word, which was maskia,

176
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,340
 which meant like Messiah.

177
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,820
 And he changed it to Christos, meaning anointed.

178
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,140
 But actually the more reasonable way of translating that

179
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,180
 would be 'unctus', meaning anointed.

180
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,820
 And that is why we call Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ

181
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,380
 because of that translation.

182
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,340
 - Oh wow, so we should call him 'unctus'.

183
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,180
 - Jesus-unct.

184
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,220
 - Jesus-unct, yeah.

185
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:32,060
 'Buntiano Ronaldo' should be like anyone called Christian

186
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,900
 or anything like that should be 'uncty' under at least.

187
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,340
 - He is quite an oily man right now, exactly.

188
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,700
 But it's not amazing like one little bit of translation

189
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,740
 can change so much in history.

190
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,380
 - Yeah, when we get Christopher from as well, isn't it?

191
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,540
 - Yeah, Christian, everything.

192
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,700
 - So 'unct', 'unct', 'unct', for example. - Oh.

193
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,540
 (laughing)

194
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,500
 - The untuffer, untuffer. - Yeah.

195
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,580
 (laughing)

196
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:56,500
 - The only thing I know about St. Jerome is that he apparently told,

197
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,860
 I think this is in the realms of maybe, tree, maybe not, tree.

198
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,940
 He told nuns not to eat beans because he thought the flatulence

199
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,660
 that they would produce is so close to the...

200
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,860
 - Stainerist, dangerous, theorotic.

201
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,500
 - That they might induce orgasms accidentally

202
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,980
 off the tickling sensation of the fart.

203
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:18,380
 So he said, "Tony beans nuns."

204
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,220
 And went back to translating the Bible.

205
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,500
 (laughing)

206
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,940
 - There's a story told by John Sessions on QI

207
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,980
 in one of the early series that you guys might remember,

208
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,580
 which I always love.

209
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,300
 And I actually don't like, I think his author,

210
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,540
 but he's been told by someone else.

211
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,940
 He was told by Gandhi himself probably.

212
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:39,140
 That was what I'm assuming, but basically in the scene,

213
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,340
 so there are 300,000 extras, as you say,

214
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,260
 and Richard Attenborough's the director.

215
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:46,380
 And the person who's organizing all the extras

216
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,740
 in the whole scene is this other guy called David Tomlin,

217
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,020
 who's overseeing this funeral scene.

218
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:54,940
 So Gandhi's just died, and Attenborough says to Tomlin,

219
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:58,900
 you've got to tell these 300,000 extras how they're gonna behave.

220
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,820
 And Gandhi's just died their hero,

221
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,860
 like the ultimate icon of their country.

222
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,700
 This is the worst news they've ever heard.

223
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,780
 They're devastated, their lives have fallen apart

224
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,860
 from all the ray eyes.

225
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:12,060
 Can you possibly convey to them how they have to act?

226
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,820
 So David Tomlin just turned down to this crowd and said,

227
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,900
 "Right, listen up, Gandhi's dead, and you're all fucking sad."

228
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,220
 (laughing)

229
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,220
 - Wow, that was very good.

230
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,580
 - So there are three bridges now, I think,

231
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:28,180
 spanning the boss for us and built it various different times.

232
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:32,220
 But the 1973 one, the first one was the game changer.

233
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:36,460
 In 1960s, you had to wait two and a half hours to cross,

234
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,260
 I think by car, but it was just so clogged.

235
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,660
 And then for vans and lorries, it was days you had to wait to cross,

236
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,580
 on by boat, before the bridge had happened.

237
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,780
 - Oh yeah.

238
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,020
 - And I listened to this amazing interview with Harvey Binney,

239
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,620
 who is one of the architects, British guy.

240
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,740
 He's retired now, obviously, because it was a long time ago.

241
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,100
 And he was interviewed by the BBC,

242
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,460
 and here's a good riddle of me this.

243
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,460
 - Oh, okay, come on.

244
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:01,740
 - The distance between the tops of the two towers,

245
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,980
 'cause this is a suspension bridge.

246
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,140
 It's got two towers spanning a little bit,

247
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,460
 is different at the top and at the bottom.

248
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,100
 - Riddle me this.

249
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,340
 - Sorry, so as a new take the top,

250
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,380
 and then you go straight down that pole to the bottom.

251
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,580
 - Those towers are not straight.

252
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,300
 - Well, they are straight.

253
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,580
 - Oh, is it the curvature of the earth?

254
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,380
 - The earth is not straight.

255
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,500
 - That was right, what I said.

256
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,500
 - Yeah, okay.

257
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,740
 - Because they had to build both towers absolutely straight,

258
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,180
 but it's such a distance apart,

259
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,380
 that if you build them both straight,

260
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,060
 the curvature of the earth comes in a way.

261
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,060
 And it's about 10 centimeters different at the top.

262
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,060
 - Who's it?

263
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,580
 - We did have to take that into account,

264
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:38,900
 because you don't want to end up with 10 centimeters of cable.

265
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,060
 - Can you get to the other one?

266
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,460
 - It's long, but it's not that long.

267
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,580
 - The earth doesn't feel that curved, does it?

268
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,980
 - I know, the earth is more curved than you'd think.

269
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,500
 - The earth is a lot more curved than dumb things.

270
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,340
 - Oh yeah.

271
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,020
 (all laughing)

272
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,580
 - Oh, me too, okay, now on the go.

273
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,460
 - We're just constantly losing giant containers

274
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,540
 off the back of ships.

275
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,380
 - Why don't I pick it?

276
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,340
 You'd want to fish them out as you was in each one.

277
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,180
 - You would, right?

278
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:01,940
 - You could be a container of baked beans,

279
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,180
 a container of barbies.

280
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,620
 - That is a fun format for a TV show.

281
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,620
 - How does it work, sorry?

282
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,620
 - They already do this.

283
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,980
 - Well, it's a team of celebrities.

284
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,300
 - But there is one of these that exists,

285
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,420
 but it's on land, right?

286
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,660
 Where you go into containers and you open them up.

287
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,860
 - That's it, it's an American show.

288
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,500
 And you take an all-containing unit

289
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,540
 that's not being claimed, or it's run out,

290
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,020
 and they haven't paid their rent and so on.

291
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:24,620
 - Yeah, that doesn't, that doesn't,

292
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,460
 I don't love this show.

293
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,020
 - And a load of experts can look inside,

294
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,740
 but they can't, they can't go in,

295
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,740
 they can't open anything up.

296
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,540
 So you just have to bid an amount for it,

297
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,140
 based on what, you know, what is it called?

298
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,620
 - Nothing wrong with liking a really good show, you know?

299
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,100
 As a storage wall, storage wall.

300
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,380
 - Can I just say if the producers of storage was

301
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,100
 our listening and they want a celebrity to come on,

302
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,260
 then Dan is available.

303
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,260
 - I am available.

304
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,260
 - It's my house, isn't it?

305
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,860
 I'll send you in this little rowing boat

306
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,220
 to the middle of the Pacific Ocean to find a container.

307
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,500
 - The thing about heartbeats is

308
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,340
 some people can hear their own heartbeats better than others.

309
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,940
 And this is called empty reception.

310
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,540
 And it's the ability to interpret signals

311
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,820
 from inside your body.

312
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,060
 - I'm so hoping you don't say this means

313
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,060
 I'm going to die prematurely,

314
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,580
 because I hear my heartbeats so loudly all the time.

315
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:13,020
 - You're more likely to report having anxiety

316
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,260
 if you do that, and you're more likely to,

317
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,460
 if your heartbeats changes slightly,

318
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,980
 to think it's something to be worried about,

319
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,020
 whereas actually normally,

320
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,380
 people's heartbeats do change quite a lot throughout

321
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,780
 the cost of a day.

322
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:29,140
 And actually the best thing is to have a medium,

323
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,900
 you want to sometimes hear it a little bit,

324
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,300
 but not be obsessed with it, basically.

325
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,060
 - So are you concerned about it sometimes, Anna?

326
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,220
 - No, I don't get concerned.

327
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,380
 It keeps me awake sometimes,

328
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,340
 'cause you lie down on your pillow,

329
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,300
 you can always hear it in your ear.

330
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,860
 - So do you hear it internally,

331
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,620
 or can you hear it outwardly?

332
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,700
 - Hear it out, what, like,

333
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,180
 hear it pretty much gets my shoulder hurt.

334
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,260
 - Yeah, can you, no.

335
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,740
 That's physically, I mean,

336
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,580
 can you hear the noise?

337
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,700
 - You're not a cartoon character, aren't you?

338
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,500
 Could your husband hear the noise,

339
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,180
 or is it through your inner ear?

340
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,020
 - I've never asked him,

341
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,420
 but I snore so loudly that I think it would cover

342
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,860
 your like the, you know, the telltale heart

343
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:01,700
 by a gorilla heart.

344
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,540
 - Oh yeah.

345
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,020
 - You're like that, your whole life.

346
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,020
 - I am.

347
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,300
 Hang on, what is the heart tell?

348
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,140
 It beats it so much.

349
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,300
 - It's he's murdered somewhere.

350
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,100
 - He's murdered, he's murdered the old man.

351
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:10,940
 Oh, it happens right away.

352
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,220
 It's sort of straight away,

353
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,260
 he kills the old man,

354
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,300
 'cause he's got this weird eye.

355
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,140
 The old man has a weird eye,

356
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,860
 the guy hates that this old man has this weird eye,

357
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,060
 and he gets obsessed with it,

358
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,900
 and he decides, well, I'm not gonna have to kill the old man,

359
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,860
 but I mean, I think I just live in the same building

360
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,700
 or something, it's always his landlord or something,

361
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,180
 but he kills him.

362
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,780
 And then he buries one of the floorboards,

363
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,300
 and he keeps hearing his heart beat,

364
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,740
 and some people come around to investigate.

365
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,420
 We've heard there's been an old man murdered.

366
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,260
 - Boom, boom.

367
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,100
 - And yeah, boom, boom.

368
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,260
 He's like, can you not hear that?

369
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,100
 - No, I don't know.

370
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:38,940
 - No, I was gonna hear it.

371
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,420
 (laughing)

372
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,860
 - I was actually looking up,

373
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,100
 'cause I was thinking I like eel in Japanese restaurants,

374
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,900
 which is the only context I've really had it,

375
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,820
 but obviously it used to be a huge thing.

376
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,660
 It was mostly in London and Cockney's

377
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,020
 and everyone ate jelly deal, right?

378
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,820
 You'd have pie, mash, and eel shops, or whatever.

379
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,660
 - That's right.

380
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:58,060
 - I was wondering, was it nice?

381
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:01,020
 And honestly, I've been through so many forums

382
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,940
 where people were reminiscing about using it

383
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:06,100
 and not a single person has said it wasn't disgusting.

384
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,580
 - And that's presumably, if you're posting on those forums,

385
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,220
 you're kind of nostalgic or buffer.

386
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,060
 - Exactly.

387
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,060
 - I would think is the prime territory.

388
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:13,900
 - You're desperate to say,

389
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,860
 "Oh, it was better in the good old days."

390
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,700
 (laughing)

391
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,980
 - It was rank, I thought.

392
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,420
 After Brexit, I thought we were gonna get it back.

393
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,260
 - Did you?

394
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,260
 - Yeah, that was the Sunlit Uplands

395
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,100
 that I was looking for.

396
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,660
 - That's what you voted for, wasn't it?

397
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,500
 - Yeah, yeah.

398
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,660
 - Prick that the jelly deal.

399
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,020
 - No, actually Brexit has stuffed the eel thing.

400
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:31,860
 - Oh, no.

401
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,260
 - I'm so sorry, it has.

402
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,100
 - Wasted voters.

403
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:38,260
 - I'm sure you guys are familiar with the Sustainable eel group.

404
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,380
 Basically, we used to ship 10 million eels a year to Europe.

405
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,140
 Legally, this isn't traffic.

406
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,300
 And more than half of that was for rewilding.

407
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,140
 'Cause if you get an eel swimming into the Seven Astray,

408
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,140
 it's screwed, right?

409
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,100
 It's like, it can't get up the Seven Astray

410
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,420
 to a spawning ground.

411
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,820
 The river is too blocked up.

412
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,540
 But there are loads of places in Europe

413
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,220
 where you can introduce Neil.

414
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,180
 It'll swim up, it'll find a cracking place to spawn, whatever.

415
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,260
 And you've done a great job there.

416
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,580
 But Brexit has ruined it.

417
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,860
 - 'Cause they can't fill in the paperwork and stuff.

418
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,860
 - It's good.

419
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,540
 - Yeah, they can't fill in the paperwork.

420
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,140
 But it basically tried barriers.

421
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,340
 - Yeah, it's a bit of a pain.

422
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,180
 - Does your heart really go blah, blah, blah?

423
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,180
 Does it just go blah, blah?

424
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,540
 And you've just heard the blah, blah, blah in movies.

425
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,380
 - Or is it an echo?

426
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,540
 Is the--

427
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,380
 - Oh, oh.

428
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,820
 - If you've got a very hollow body.

429
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,660
 (laughing)

430
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,500
 - Yeah.

431
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,340
 - The hollow head.

432
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,500
 - I'm just testing now.

433
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,660
 - It does go blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

434
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,500
 - Does it?

435
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,580
 - Sometimes I'm only using really hard, I think.

436
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,860
 - I can only hear the, at the moment,

437
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,700
 I can only hear the boom.

438
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,860
 - Yeah.

439
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,820
 - Well, you're using your pulse.

440
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:33,660
 - Yeah.

441
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,500
 - You're not listening to your--

442
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,660
 - But it's like, for instance, if you listen--

443
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,540
 - But what do you think the, what do you think the heart is?

444
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,820
 - Well, I think the heart, I, the boom,

445
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,700
 I associate with heart, not with my pulse.

446
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,700
 I know that you can feel the pulse,

447
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,100
 but you can't say, oh, I can hear my heart

448
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,060
 by touching your veins on your wrist.

449
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:47,900
 - Yeah.

450
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,420
 - It's like, this is all got a bit stoner,

451
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,260
 but go on James.

452
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:54,020
 - Right back, well, I doubt I will, but it's like with a clock, you know,

453
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,780
 clock ticks, but it doesn't talk.

454
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:59,900
 It just goes tick, tick, tick, because it's the same mechanism

455
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,060
 doing it all the time.

456
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,940
 But if you're, if you listen to it, you can almost hear a talk

457
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,940
 even though there's not one there because you're expecting it.

458
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,300
 - I was playing it cool by agreeing with you,

459
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,860
 but I absolutely thought there was a talk.

460
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,460
 - Go in every clock.

461
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,220
 They'd entered two different tones, just before.

462
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,420
 - I thought the pendulum, yeah, I assumed for years and years

463
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,340
 when the pendulum goes one way, that makes a tick sound.

464
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:21,940
 And then, I don't know, inside the glass cabinet, there's something

465
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,060
 which makes it sound a bit different going the other way.

466
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,580
 - It's weird that you still got that pendulum watch.

467
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,340
 - There is a different kind of eel,

468
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,700
 which does a similar-ish thing.

469
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,140
 It's called a snake eel.

470
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:35,420
 And they have a very pointy tip on their tail.

471
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,140
 And they use it in a slightly different way.

472
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:40,260
 They use it just to power out of the stomach of the fish,

473
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,900
 which has eaten the sideways.

474
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,620
 I mean, they just go out of the stomach.

475
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,780
 - Oh, like here's it.

476
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,620
 - They just pierce it.

477
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,460
 They just go through.

478
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,740
 - Well, that sounds not very good for the fish.

479
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,300
 It's not good for anyone, because they can't get through

480
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,420
 the ribcage once they're through the stomach.

481
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,300
 So they just end up stuck in there.

482
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,500
 - That's like a blooper from the alien movies.

483
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,100
 (laughing)

484
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,940
 The alien's like, "I'm stuck, we're gonna have to do this again."

485
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,860
 - Yeah, and the fish doesn't even notice.

486
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:06,180
 Fish can cope with a lot of stuff.

487
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,460
 - Something piercing a big hole in its stomach

488
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,420
 and then landing up squirming around at its ribcage.

489
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,980
 - Okay, I don't know whether they don't notice,

490
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,700
 but they definitely don't take any action.

491
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,540
 - They play cool.

492
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,380
 - They play cool.

493
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,220
 - Yeah, good on 'em.

494
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,260
 - Oh, if you eat muscles as a human,

495
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,220
 you put them in the pot and it's boiling water.

496
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,980
 - They often come back out, don't they?

497
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:24,820
 - Oh, okay.

498
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,660
 - Pricing onto it.

499
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,220
 - But you're not supposed to eat the clothes ones

500
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,340
 'cause they might come out.

501
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,180
 - Yeah.

502
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,700
 - Well, that is actually true if you're a sea an enemy.

503
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,300
 If you eat a muscle and it's closed,

504
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,100
 then the muscle can just go through your body

505
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,900
 and come out the other end and the muscle will still be fine.

506
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,060
 - Oh, really?

507
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:39,900
 - Yeah.

508
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,060
 Whereas normally what they'll do

509
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,500
 is they'll bring in the muscle and the shell

510
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,620
 and then they'll eat the muscle and eject the shell,

511
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,100
 but if it's closed, they can't get us

512
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:47,940
 to the muscle.

513
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,980
 - Do the enemies and enemies eat the whole thing

514
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,740
 and then to sort it out inside?

515
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,980
 'Cause that's a more dignified way of eating, I think.

516
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:55,820
 - Yeah.

517
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,220
 - Now, if you could do that with a lobster.

518
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,940
 - If you could do that with a big mac

519
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:03,020
 and you put in the entire burger and the plastic

520
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,740
 that goes round it.

521
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,740
 - With a plastic on the trees.

522
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,220
 - Oh, if you could, yeah.

523
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,700
 (laughing)

524
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,220
 - Or if you could do it with a kinder egg

525
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,500
 and then you could eat the whole thing

526
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,500
 and you could even make the tie inside you.

527
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,340
 - I love that.

528
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,740
 (laughing)

529
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,460
 - There's a little mechanical women on those.

530
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,460
 (laughing)

531
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:23,940
 50% of eel consumed on the planet is eaten in Japan.

532
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,780
 - It's big.

533
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,980
 - And if you go to a Japanese restaurant,

534
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,620
 they'll always have, they have eel on the menu.

535
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:32,060
 But the nice news is that 35% of Japanese people

536
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,900
 are willing to eat cultured eel.

537
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,380
 - What eel that goes to the theatre?

538
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,220
 - That's right.

539
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,060
 - Yeah, yeah.

540
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,420
 It costs more because obviously you've seen the price

541
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,740
 of the restaurant these days.

542
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,420
 (laughing)

543
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,420
 - No, you can't.

544
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:46,460
 It's saturated laden is, it light Hamilton.

545
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,540
 It doesn't love it.

546
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,860
 It wasn't five stars.

547
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:52,260
 But no, it's like, you can grow really good eel now.

548
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,940
 You know, the art of it, like growing meats

549
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,420
 which are of different varieties.

550
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,100
 The eel you can get now is really, really nice.

551
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,140
 - We're at like fake eel.

552
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:58,980
 - Yeah, yeah.

553
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,820
 - Oh, really?

554
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,740
 - It looks like it, it tastes like it, all of that, you know?

555
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,020
 So that might be quite good.

556
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,060
 - And how many Japanese people are willing to eat that?

557
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:05,900
 - Over a third.

558
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,300
 - That's good figures.

559
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,220
 That's much better than like,

560
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,900
 proportions of American people who are willing to eat fake meat.

561
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,900
 I suspect cultured meat.

562
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,820
 - Yeah, but we all say we're willing to eat kangaroo

563
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,260
 testicles until we're actually on.

564
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,740
 I'm a celebrity, give me out here.

565
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,580
 (laughing)

566
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,740
 And then, you know what I'm saying?

567
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,580
 - You're right.

568
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,420
 - You're right.

569
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:24,780
 - Alfred Hitchcock was terrified of eggs had over phobia.

570
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:28,300
 So he said, the white round thing without any holes.

571
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,860
 That's how we refer it to eggs.

572
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,780
 And when you break it inside, there's that yellow thing

573
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,340
 round without any holes.

574
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,740
 So I think he likes holes and he doesn't like eggs.

575
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,340
 - Did he like ping pong balls?

576
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,180
 - Yeah, I don't know.

577
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,460
 He's no mention on ping pong balls,

578
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,900
 but what's interesting is his favorite breakfast

579
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,900
 was quiche Lorraine and he used to make it himself.

580
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,740
 - What?

581
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,540
 - Yeah, so he would have to deal with his phobia

582
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:53,060
 until the egg no longer resembled an egg.

583
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,060
 And then he was fine with it.

584
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,060
 - Stick hole in it.

585
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,660
 - Stick hole in it, yeah.

586
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,780
 - So that says to me, wasn't that serious?

587
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,820
 Was it if he's still making his own quiche Lorraine?

588
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,380
 - No, 'cause I think it's a sort of,

589
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,380
 you face your fears and then it goes quite quickly

590
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,660
 once you get the fear.

591
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,380
 For him it was the shape and the lack of hole.

592
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,380
 - No, no, I know, but if I like,

593
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,820
 I don't like a house spider.

594
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:14,060
 And I can't just like go and kill a house spider really fast

595
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,100
 and be like, well, it was really quick,

596
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:15,940
 so it doesn't matter.

597
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,780
 - I see, yeah.

598
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,620
 - 'Cause I can't go near it.

599
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,940
 - The other day I met a house spider fell on me

600
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:23,140
 as I was sitting up in bed from the ceiling.

601
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:23,980
 And it was, it was a bit--

602
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,500
 - It told me this before I didn't enjoy the story

603
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,740
 at the time, I'm not enjoying it now.

604
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,740
 - It was a four-incher.

605
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,580
 - I don't like it.

606
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,580
 - And I was shirtless.

607
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,220
 - That's not four-inchers for you.

608
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:34,460
 (all laughing)

609
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,660
 - So low-albender, right?

610
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,820
 If you haven't already covered this,

611
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,620
 I'd like you to know that some US banks

612
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,340
 have their own zip code.

613
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,180
 - Oh, nice.

614
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,020
 - It's cool, isn't it?

615
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:43,860
 - Okay.

616
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,460
 - And then they write, I came across this

617
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,700
 because for reasons unknown to me, meetup.com

618
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,260
 defaulted to that zip code.

619
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,420
 But I'm in and then they give their own zip code.

620
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,660
 (all laughing)

621
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,500
 - Which is?

622
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,060
 - Well, I think this might be a call for help, really.

623
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:57,900
 - Yeah.

624
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,460
 - What's meetup.com?

625
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,140
 - Well, it sounds like a dating site.

626
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:01,980
 - It does, doesn't it?

627
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,940
 - And it then sounds like he's trying to give his address

628
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:07,660
 on the podcast, or she, or they.

629
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:11,340
 So I wonder if this is just a trick to try and get some

630
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,180
 - Yeah.

631
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,020
 - Fistless.

632
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:13,860
 - Three meetups.

633
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,900
 - Are we being cat-fished?

634
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,740
 - Brilliant.

635
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,740
 - Right now.

636
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,700
 - Wait, I'm so confused.

637
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,660
 So this person went on a dating site

638
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,100
 and ended up accidentally booking in a date with a bank.

639
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,100
 (all laughing)

640
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,900
 Went to meet the date, had put misleading pictures up

641
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,540
 of a not bank, and then arrived in it with a bank.

642
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,380
 - No, it's better.

643
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,420
 - Come over and make a deposit.

644
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,180
 I bet the innuendo is going to be,

645
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,220
 what's the safe word?

646
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,060
 There we go.

647
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:34,900
 - Yep, there we go.

648
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,900
 - I'm good, yeah, yeah.

649
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:36,740
 - Put 'em up.

650
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,420
 (all laughing)

651
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,260
 - This is a stick-up.

652
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:42,780
 (all laughing)

653
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,180
 - I make the same mistake every week when we do this,

654
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,780
 and then I go home, and I get sushi

655
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,020
 for the thing next to the station,

656
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,660
 you know, which comes with soy sauce and wasabi.

657
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,620
 But it's always rammed the train.

658
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,460
 So I squeeze in, and then you have to get the chopsticks out

659
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,940
 and you have to open the soy sauce,

660
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,420
 and you have to open the soy sauce.

661
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,580
 And it goes just everywhere.

662
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,820
 - And you have to ask someone to hold your fingerball,

663
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,540
 and it's, you had to take your shoes off as well.

664
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,620
 It's like that.

665
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,460
 - But you know when you started,

666
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,980
 you're like, people would think I've given up

667
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,220
 if I don't keep going.

668
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,900
 So I'm always covered in soy sauce and it's stink.

669
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,700
 - I don't think people think about you that much.

670
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,700
 I don't mean to offend,

671
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,340
 but just most people are busy with their own stuff.

672
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,940
 They're not gonna think that woman's only,

673
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,180
 "I want to stop eating her sushi half."

674
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,020
 - What's going on?

675
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:19,860
 - Oh, what?

676
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,180
 - She's the top-podcast that I'm at.

677
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,180
 - Shinski eating half a sushi.

678
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,260
 (all laughing)

679
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,340
 - She's quit, isn't she?

680
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,180
 She's turned.

681
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,300
 That was to finish it.

682
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,260
 - Why don't you go and eat the other half?

683
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,860
 (all laughing)

684
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,460
 - You used to hurt dinner.

685
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,900
 - Oh shit, I missed my start.

686
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,060
 (all laughing)

687
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:37,900
 - It was worth it.

688
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,740
 - It was worth it.

689
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:43,100
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

690
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,420
 and that is Andy.

691
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,220
 My fact is that after Chernobyl,

692
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,740
 nearby children were tweeted.

693
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,980
 And they taught, they taught.

694
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,500
 We're putting that in there.

695
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,500
 - Good.

696
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,300
 - Someone sent us a tweet this morning, actually,

697
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,220
 Sean Gibson, and it was referring to,

698
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,420
 it's just a headline from the Intelligencie Journal

699
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,740
 in Pennsylvania from 1913,

700
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:09,740
 Self-Rising Bed exceeds expectations

701
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,980
 and throws inventor out of the window.

702
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,980
 (all laughing)

703
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,660
 No more information given.

704
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,500
 - Brilliant, I need it.

705
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,900
 - The thing that you have always done back up since I was tiny

706
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,300
 is you drink some water upside down.

707
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,900
 - Yeah, that all of that stuff is rubbish.

708
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,740
 - No, it works.

709
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,580
 - No, it doesn't.

710
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,420
 - It's just a distraction, Tony.

711
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,420
 - It's been proven to be all rubbish.

712
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,260
 - It works for me.

713
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,340
 - No, it doesn't.

714
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,540
 - You're still hiccuping.

715
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,380
 (all laughing)

716
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,220
 You've been doing it all day.

717
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,060
 - No, not.

718
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:37,540
 - My headline thanks this week is from Jeffrey Partica

719
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:40,060
 or Partica or Parti Car.

720
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:40,900
 - Partica, yeah.

721
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,060
 - Partica, yeah, it's possible.

722
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,460
 - Remember when we went to Dublin,

723
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,660
 and we got in a Partica.

724
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,500
 - Yeah, that was cool.

725
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,340
 - That was cool.

726
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,180
 - That was the taxi.

727
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,020
 - Unintentionally, we didn't know.

728
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:48,860
 - I don't remember that.

729
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,420
 - We got a taxi home from a gig,

730
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,380
 and then the guy just pressed a button,

731
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,860
 and all the lights start going off,

732
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,100
 and there's like a disco ball,

733
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,100
 and they started playing music.

734
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,420
 - It just went thundersly disco,

735
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,140
 like-- - They always do that in taxis for me.

736
00:22:59,140 --> 00:22:59,980
 - It's very cool.

737
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:00,980
 - All right, yeah.

738
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,820
 - What do you don't remember?

739
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,340
 (laughing)

740
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,260
 - Electric heels are not a type of heel.

741
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,100
 - Are they not?

742
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,100
 - No, they don't seem they were.

743
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,780
 - They're just an electric fish that's very long.

744
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,540
 But I thought I'd read about them anyway.

745
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:15,420
 There's this absolutely hero called Ken Catania,

746
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:18,980
 who's worked out what it feels like to be attacked

747
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,180
 by an electric heel,

748
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:23,700
 and he says that being attacked by a large electric heel

749
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,940
 is like being tazered by nine tazers at the same time.

750
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,540
 - Well, what he did was he stuck his tank arm

751
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,420
 into a tank with a small eel.

752
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,700
 - I did it 10 times,

753
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,420
 and he reckons because he knows how electric heels work.

754
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,660
 You could just extrapolate from the small eel

755
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,460
 to the size of a normal eel.

756
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,740
 So if you get bitten by a small electric heel,

757
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:45,500
 it's about the same as touching a horse fence.

758
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,340
 - Okay.

759
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,180
 - Do you know what that's like?

760
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,100
 - I do, actually, yeah.

761
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,260
 - Yeah, 'cause you like to steal horses, don't you?

762
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,060
 - I do, I do, I use to raise on the podcast,

763
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,260
 but yeah, my horse rusted that.

764
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,580
 - You've touched an electrified horse fence.

765
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,180
 - Yeah, well, 'cause you know, when you're a kid,

766
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:57,940
 we used to line up,

767
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:58,980
 so one of you touched the fence,

768
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,980
 and then everyone holds onto the other one shoulders,

769
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:01,820
 and then you--

770
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,220
 - Okay, so it's a bit of a shock, it's not a shock.

771
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,300
 - It's quite a shock.

772
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,740
 - Hang on, if you're holding it normally,

773
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:08,180
 does it not shock you at all because you're earthed

774
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,660
 with your rubber shoes or other?

775
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,100
 - No, the earth thing is the problem, right?

776
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,420
 'Cause it goes through your body together.

777
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,260
 - Oh, sorry.

778
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,100
 - So you're not wearing your big wellies at this point?

779
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,380
 - No, no, the whole point is to shock you

780
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,860
 and your all your friends in a line.

781
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,300
 Anyway, electric heels work.

782
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,300
 He says, but he hasn't actually had the bulls

783
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,540
 to sting himself with a proper big one.

784
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,420
 - No, because actually if you're tazered by nine tazers,

785
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,580
 you have properly get it die.

786
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,420
 - Yeah.

787
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,140
 - Oh, good idea, very nice.

788
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,900
 (laughing)

789
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,700
 - And one interesting thing is that they use their electricity

790
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,380
 for electro-location so they can,

791
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:40,020
 a bit like so now, they can kind of fire their electric field

792
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,900
 around and then feel where everything is.

793
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,740
 So 'cause it's so dark and muddy down there,

794
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:48,100
 and that's how they can see where everything is.

795
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:51,140
 But the sensors that they use, it's not exactly the same,

796
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,180
 but it's very, very similar principles

797
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,540
 to how your mobile phone works.

798
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:58,460
 So you know how there's sensors in there

799
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,540
 that kind of can tell that your fingers there

800
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,540
 and it's all about capacitors and blah, blah, blah,

801
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,540
 I'm not gonna go into it now,

802
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,780
 but it's basically the same technology

803
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,860
 as electric heels used to find the way around.

804
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,700
 - Do you see?

805
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,940
 You've got all your clever computers

806
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,540
 and all your internet in the old days,

807
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:14,460
 we got around just with ill tech.

808
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,020
 (laughing)

809
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,740
 And we jelly him up at the end of the day.

810
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:20,020
 It was absolutely horrible.

811
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:23,020
 (laughing)

812
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:26,260
 I was, isn't it weird that when you have a bisectomy

813
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,980
 and then you produce semen?

814
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,220
 What would you think that looks like?

815
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,860
 'Cause you know when you think about, you picture semen.

816
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:32,700
 - Yeah.

817
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,540
 - And you think that that's--

818
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,780
 - I can't picture anything in my head,

819
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:37,140
 but I'm not, not even gonna try this one.

820
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,580
 - It probably looks absolutely identical.

821
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,860
 Yeah, maybe, or just a bit more watery.

822
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,020
 - That's what I would have thought it looks more watery.

823
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,140
 - It looks like more transparent, maybe.

824
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,140
 - Maybe it doesn't have those green bits there.

825
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,300
 (laughing)

826
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,140
 - It's just...

827
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,740
 (laughing)

828
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,660
 (laughing)

829
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,620
 - We still got the chunky cheesy bits, right?

830
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,620
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

831
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,740
 (laughing)

832
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,740
 - It's a different shoe they need to color, James.

833
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,340
 - It's not, it's doesn't sparkle.

834
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:05,180
 (laughing)

835
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,980
 - Well, in a way, it doesn't sparkle.

836
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:07,820
 - It doesn't sink.

837
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,420
 It doesn't make that weird singing sound.

838
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,980
 (laughing)

839
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,180
 - It's not weird.

840
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:15,060
 - There's some screaming here, so they go.

841
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:15,900
 - Don't do it.

842
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,900
 - You're right around.

843
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,060
 (laughing)

844
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,940
 - I go to Val Halag.

845
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,100
 - We'll fight them on the beach.

846
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,100
 - So Anna, Anna, come on.

847
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,500
 - Tell them more, I wanted to assist his name.

848
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,980
 - Where did you want it to go?

849
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:26,820
 - Where?

850
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,340
 - 'Cause you want it to go.

851
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:30,940
 (upbeat music)

852
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:34,300
 - Okay, doki.

853
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,220

 in a future drop us a line episode.

861
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,540
 All right, clubfish members, that is it.

862
