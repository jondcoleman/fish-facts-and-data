00:00:02,00:00:07,"Hey, Club Fish members, it is Dan here."
00:00:07,00:00:10,Welcome to your bonus compilation episode.
00:00:10,00:00:13,"This is all of the outtakes, all of the bloopers,"
00:00:13,00:00:15,"the tangents, basically all the bits"
00:00:15,00:00:18,"that didn't fit into the main narrative of the episodes,"
00:00:18,00:00:20,"but stuff that we didn't wanna get rid of,"
00:00:20,00:00:21,and so we've brought it all together
00:00:21,00:00:24,here in one handy compilation.
00:00:24,00:00:25,"But before we get into it,"
00:00:25,00:00:28,"I just wanna remind anyone who hasn't seen the news,"
00:00:28,00:00:30,we're doing a couple of live shows very soon.
00:00:30,00:00:33,"We are gonna be playing the London Podcast Festival,"
00:00:33,00:00:36,"and the fun thing about this is usually it's just a gig,"
00:00:36,00:00:39,"and I believe the two gigs are actually sold out,"
00:00:39,00:00:40,if you wanna be there physically.
00:00:40,00:00:42,"However, we're gonna be live streaming the gigs."
00:00:42,00:00:44,"Now in the past, I know this has been really fun,"
00:00:44,00:00:46,"because as you're watching the live stream,"
00:00:46,00:00:48,you can actually comment underneath
00:00:48,00:00:49,as the show's going along.
00:00:49,00:00:52,"It's a really cool way of meeting fellow fish listeners,"
00:00:52,00:00:53,if you've not done that before.
00:00:53,00:00:55,So why not check it out?
00:00:55,00:00:57,The link is on our website.
00:00:57,00:00:59,We're doing the fifth and sixth of September.
00:00:59,00:01:01,"We've partially announced the guest,"
00:01:01,00:01:03,"who's gonna be joining us on the sixth,"
00:01:03,00:01:05,and that is Richard Osman.
00:01:05,00:01:07,So that's gonna be really awesome.
00:01:07,00:01:10,"We'll be announcing our other guest very soon for the fifth,"
00:01:10,00:01:12,"but as I say, tickets are available."
00:01:12,00:01:14,You can watch it as it's happening live on stage.
00:01:14,00:01:18,So we've also got another live show announcement coming up.
00:01:18,00:01:20,"We'll be announcing it at the top of this week's show,"
00:01:20,00:01:21,"so keep a listen out for that,"
00:01:21,00:01:24,in case it happens to be in a town near you.
00:01:24,00:01:25,And that's it for the admin.
00:01:25,00:01:26,So let's get on with it.
00:01:26,00:01:29,This is a big old chunky compilation episode.
00:01:29,00:01:30,Here we go.
00:01:30,00:01:51,"Yeah, you mentioned Braveheart in this time,"
00:01:51,00:01:53,and the Battle of Sterling Bridge happened then.
00:01:53,00:01:54,I like this from Wikipedia.
00:01:54,00:01:56,The Battle of Sterling Bridge is depicted
00:01:56,00:01:58,"in the 1995 film Braveheart,"
00:01:58,00:02:01,but it bears little resemblance to the real battle.
00:02:01,00:02:04,"Most egregiously, there being no bridge."
00:02:04,00:02:08,"But that is the time when supposedly,"
00:02:08,00:02:11,the Scots lifted their kilts and showed their bums.
00:02:11,00:02:12,- Interesting.
00:02:12,00:02:14,"- To scare the English,"
00:02:14,00:02:16,but we have no evidence that that happened.
00:02:16,00:02:18,"There's no contemporary evidence that happened,"
00:02:18,00:02:21,but we do have a 14th century account
00:02:21,00:02:24,of the English doing that against the Scottish.
00:02:24,00:02:25,- Really? - During those wars.
00:02:25,00:02:26,- Dropping their trousers. - Yeah.
00:02:26,00:02:27,- Really? - I don't know.
00:02:27,00:02:29,"- In the Chronicle of Peter Langtoft,"
00:02:29,00:02:31,they mentioned the English doing that.
00:02:31,00:02:32,- No way. - I don't know.
00:02:32,00:02:34,"- And did it scare the Scots,"
00:02:34,00:02:36,"or did it make them think, ""Oh, open target?"""
00:02:36,00:02:38,"- I think we haven't seen before, you know."
00:02:38,00:02:39,"- Yeah. - We've all got them, you know."
00:02:39,00:02:42,(laughing)
00:02:42,00:02:44,Why are they triangular?
00:02:44,00:02:45,- High ends. - Yeah.
00:02:45,00:02:46,You know how they've got the point at the front?
00:02:46,00:02:48,"- Yeah. - They shape like a boat, basically."
00:02:48,00:02:49,"- Yes, yeah, good question."
00:02:49,00:02:51,"- I think to carve a route through the clothes,"
00:02:51,00:02:52,much like a boat through the water.
00:02:52,00:02:55,"If they were shaped the opposite,"
00:02:55,00:02:56,it would be harder to do the ironing.
00:02:56,00:02:57,- I think so. - I think so.
00:02:57,00:02:59,- Why don't you try doing it backwards the next time?
00:02:59,00:03:01,- That's a really good idea.
00:03:01,00:03:02,That's a really good idea.
00:03:02,00:03:04,"- And why is the shape-- - Yeah, why is the shape"
00:03:04,00:03:06,"- I'll end up with my shirt on, back to front."
00:03:06,00:03:08,That's your nightmare.
00:03:08,00:03:08,(laughing)
00:03:08,00:03:10,- My pants on your head.
00:03:10,00:03:10,(laughing)
00:03:10,00:03:12,- Be frantically searching for the why.
00:03:12,00:03:15,(laughing)
00:03:15,00:03:16,"- We used to have double pointed,"
00:03:16,00:03:18,"back to front reversible ones,"
00:03:18,00:03:20,which would save you having the whole trousers
00:03:20,00:03:22,"on your head, pullover."
00:03:22,00:03:24,"- I see, like a sort of--"
00:03:24,00:03:25,"- It looked like a leaf, I suppose."
00:03:25,00:03:26,- Like a canoe.
00:03:26,00:03:28,"- Or a canoe, yes."
00:03:28,00:03:29,- Keep the bolt analogy going.
00:03:29,00:03:31,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:03:31,00:03:32,Which we should do throughout.
00:03:32,00:03:35,And these were the most popular irons
00:03:35,00:03:38,"from about 1870 to the 1930s, '40s,"
00:03:38,00:03:39,"when electric irons came in,"
00:03:39,00:03:43,and they were invented by this woman called Mary Potts.
00:03:43,00:03:45,So she basically invented the iron
00:03:45,00:03:48,"that people were using in the late 19th, early 20th century."
00:03:48,00:03:50,And she got lots of patterns for it.
00:03:50,00:03:52,"So she made it hollow, so it wasn't as heavy."
00:03:52,00:03:55,"And it also didn't get so dangerously hot,"
00:03:55,00:03:57,'cause she filled the inside with wool
00:03:57,00:03:59,"or something non-heat conducting,"
00:03:59,00:04:01,'cause people were constantly burning their hands.
00:04:01,00:04:03,And she invented the removable handle.
00:04:03,00:04:05,"So you could constantly have,"
00:04:05,00:04:07,you could be heating up one iron
00:04:07,00:04:08,"while you were using the other,"
00:04:08,00:04:10,and then you could swap the iron onto the handle.
00:04:10,00:04:11,- That's really clever.
00:04:11,00:04:14,"- Oh, wait, why can't they both just have a handle?"
00:04:14,00:04:15,"Sorry, I've been really stupid."
00:04:15,00:04:16,"- 'Cause the handle would probably heat up, right?"
00:04:16,00:04:17,"- Get super hot, yeah. - 'Cause the only way you can't,"
00:04:17,00:04:20,"yeah, it's like when you cook an egg,"
00:04:20,00:04:22,"sometimes that handle, you gotta let go."
00:04:22,00:04:24,- I don't hold onto the pan
00:04:24,00:04:25,all the way through the cooking process.
00:04:25,00:04:27,- What? - You've got to grip
00:04:27,00:04:30,"the rim of the pan with both hands, ideally."
00:04:30,00:04:33,"- As the saying goes, a held part always biles."
00:04:33,00:04:38,- John Harvey Kellogg.
00:04:38,00:04:39,- Okay. - Oh.
00:04:39,00:04:42,- Cornflakes pioneer and anti-fiddling around
00:04:42,00:04:45,with yourself advocate.
00:04:45,00:04:46,- Go back to early episodes
00:04:46,00:04:47,to see what the hell that's referring to.
00:04:47,00:04:49,- Yes. - We won't tell you
00:04:49,00:04:51,"which one, weighing through all 580."
00:04:51,00:04:55,- I believe he invented an early sunbed.
00:04:55,00:04:58,He believed it could cure almost everything.
00:04:58,00:05:01,"And there was a big thing of sun therapy,"
00:05:01,00:05:03,"and high-altitude sunbathing in particular,"
00:05:03,00:05:06,"'cause it gave you supposedly more unfiltered ultraviolet rays,"
00:05:06,00:05:09,"which was especially good for you at the time,"
00:05:09,00:05:11,as we now know is not the case.
00:05:11,00:05:13,- It's weird 'cause there were some truths
00:05:13,00:05:15,to this idea at the time.
00:05:15,00:05:18,"I guess Kellogg thought that it filled your skin with blood,"
00:05:18,00:05:20,"which drew blood away from your diseased organs,"
00:05:20,00:05:22,which wasn't correct.
00:05:22,00:05:23,"But the seventh did, in fact,"
00:05:23,00:05:27,"install one of his sun baths in the palace in 1903,"
00:05:27,00:05:30,"where you sat in a chair, which was fully enclosed,"
00:05:30,00:05:32,and it had 52 light bulbs around you
00:05:32,00:05:35,that could glow any color for different health benefits.
00:05:35,00:05:37,But at the same time that one of the first Nobel Prizes
00:05:37,00:05:39,was awarded for discovering the benefits
00:05:39,00:05:43,of light therapy on... - Tobaccoosis.
00:05:43,00:05:45,"- And TB, yeah, exactly. - Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:05:45,00:05:48,"- Which was basically true, Niels Finnsen."
00:05:48,00:05:50,"Yeah, and then they opened lots of Solaria,"
00:05:50,00:05:52,"didn't they, all over Europe,"
00:05:52,00:05:54,which were basically for patients who were sick with stuff
00:05:54,00:05:57,"where you had these amazing sounding hospitals,"
00:05:57,00:05:58,"which the NHS would never fund today,"
00:05:58,00:06:00,but where you could lie in this room
00:06:00,00:06:02,and the entire roof would retract on a sunny day
00:06:02,00:06:04,so you could be exposed to the sun.
00:06:04,00:06:06,Or giant balconies where your whole big bed
00:06:06,00:06:08,would be wheeled out onto them.
00:06:08,00:06:10,And that was good for you.
00:06:10,00:06:12,But I don't know about the Kellogg shit.
00:06:12,00:06:13,- I don't know.
00:06:13,00:06:16,- It doesn't cure gout and constipation like Kellogg claimed.
00:06:16,00:06:18,(all laughing)
00:06:18,00:06:26,"- If you go to the beach and you get a suntan,"
00:06:26,00:06:28,then it's mostly due to the sun.
00:06:28,00:06:31,"- Thanks very much. - Carry on, Professor."
00:06:31,00:06:36,"- However, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1% of the radiation"
00:06:36,00:06:40,comes from stars beyond the galaxy.
00:06:40,00:06:41,"- Oh, that's great."
00:06:41,00:06:44,"- Because it's photons coming from, you know,"
00:06:44,00:06:47,from outer outer space that come onto our earth.
00:06:47,00:06:50,And a certain amount of those photons will go into your body
00:06:50,00:06:52,and they will cause your body to turn.
00:06:52,00:06:53,- That's so cool.
00:06:53,00:06:55,"If you get a night suntan,"
00:06:55,00:06:57,"and how, I suppose it would take too long."
00:06:57,00:06:58,"- I think it would take too long,"
00:06:58,00:07:00,given the number of zeros and that number.
00:07:00,00:07:02,"- So with that photon,"
00:07:02,00:07:05,"that's traveled billions of miles across the universe,"
00:07:05,00:07:06,is that the end point?
00:07:06,00:07:07,- Absorbs into your body.
00:07:07,00:07:09,- You're the end point for this photon.
00:07:09,00:07:11,"- Pretty cool, that is pretty cool."
00:07:11,00:07:12,"- I mean, is that true?"
00:07:12,00:07:13,Is that what it would be?
00:07:13,00:07:14,"- Yeah, it would absolve into your body."
00:07:14,00:07:16,"- Wow, I read a thing as well that not only do we get"
00:07:16,00:07:19,"that 0.0, 0.0, whatever it is,"
00:07:19,00:07:22,"percentage of our suntan from the stars beyond our sun,"
00:07:22,00:07:25,but also from the leftover of the Big Bang.
00:07:25,00:07:26,"- Yeah, it's plausible."
00:07:26,00:07:29,"- Tan from the Big Bang, a Bangtan, cool."
00:07:29,00:07:32,- That's pretty wild. - That's awesome.
00:07:32,00:07:33,- Really good. - There was another one.
00:07:33,00:07:36,This one definitely has some kind of meaning to it.
00:07:36,00:07:38,"So in Melanesian legend,"
00:07:38,00:07:42,"they had two gods called Tagaro and Tsukumatua,"
00:07:42,00:07:45,and they shared the work of creation.
00:07:45,00:07:48,"But whenever Tagaro did something,"
00:07:48,00:07:52,"he did it well, and Tsukumatua did it really badly."
00:07:52,00:07:54,"And so like, when they made trees,"
00:07:54,00:07:57,"Tagaro made really nice food,"
00:07:57,00:08:00,"and Tsukumatua's was really bitter, and stuff like that."
00:08:00,00:08:04,Like Tsukumatua wanted to have men
00:08:04,00:08:07,"sleep in the trunks of Sego palms,"
00:08:07,00:08:10,"but Tagaro thought, no, they should live in houses instead,"
00:08:10,00:08:11,and stuff like that.
00:08:11,00:08:13,"And when they created men,"
00:08:13,00:08:17,"Tagaro said that humans should have anuses,"
00:08:17,00:08:19,"but Tsukumatua said, no,"
00:08:19,00:08:21,they definitely shouldn't have anuses.
00:08:21,00:08:24,"And as a result, the ones that he made,"
00:08:24,00:08:27,swelled up and burst because they could not defecate.
00:08:27,00:08:32,"- And again, is the meaning, do the job properly?"
00:08:32,00:08:34,Do you work? - I think so.
00:08:34,00:08:36,"- Like, don't half-ass it, literally half-ass it."
00:08:36,00:08:39,"- It's like the yin, don't zero-ass it, yeah."
00:08:39,00:08:41,"It's like the yin and the yang, right?"
00:08:41,00:08:43,"It's like you always have to have the,"
00:08:43,00:08:45,"not good and evil in this case,"
00:08:45,00:08:48,but sort of good and not very good.
00:08:48,00:08:49,"- Right, right, right."
00:08:49,00:08:50,"And it's, yeah, yeah."
00:08:50,00:08:52,I think we've just invented a new phrase.
00:08:52,00:08:54,"I think we can just say, you've no asked this."
00:08:54,00:08:56,He's really no asked that project.
00:08:56,00:08:58,I think that's good.
00:08:58,00:09:01,- I think like the Basque language actually is quite good
00:09:01,00:09:03,for onomatopoeic words.
00:09:03,00:09:05,So words that sound like they're supposed to be.
00:09:05,00:09:07,"So, do you know what pill-pill?"
00:09:07,00:09:10,"- Your medicine? - A pill, yeah, two pills."
00:09:10,00:09:12,"No, no, it's onomatopoeic."
00:09:12,00:09:14,It's gonna sound like the big pill-pill.
00:09:14,00:09:18,"Pill-pill, a laser, a laser, a space laser in a film."
00:09:18,00:09:19,"Oh, that would be pew-pew."
00:09:19,00:09:20,"Oh, yes."
00:09:20,00:09:23,It's the word for boiling liquid.
00:09:23,00:09:24,"Okay, nice, yeah, I see that."
00:09:24,00:09:25,"Terrain, pill-pill."
00:09:25,00:09:25,Terrain.
00:09:25,00:09:27,Say it again.
00:09:27,00:09:28,Terrain.
00:09:28,00:09:29,Terrain.
00:09:29,00:09:29,Terrain.
00:09:29,00:09:31,Terrain.
00:09:31,00:09:32,"Terrain, terrain."
00:09:32,00:09:34,"Terrain, terrain, terrain, terrain."
00:09:34,00:09:35,"It's the pink one, the theme tune."
00:09:35,00:09:36,There we go.
00:09:36,00:09:39,It's a word for bell-ringing.
00:09:39,00:09:42,"Okay, as in like, to ring, to ring."
00:09:42,00:09:44,"To ring, to ring, to ring, to ring, to ring, to ring, to ring."
00:09:44,00:09:46,"To ring, to ring, to ring, to ring, to ring."
00:09:46,00:09:48,And what about this one?
00:09:48,00:09:49,Cheez-ah.
00:09:49,00:09:50,"Cheez-ah, cheez-ah, cheez-ah."
00:09:50,00:09:51,"Cheez-ah, cheez-ah, cheez-ah."
00:09:51,00:09:54,"Cheez-ah, cheez-ah, cheez-ah."
00:09:54,00:09:56,"Yes, it's the word for Tom Jones."
00:09:56,00:09:59,No. Did he sing that?
00:09:59,00:10:00,I don't know.
00:10:00,00:10:03,And it's the word for urinating.
00:10:03,00:10:07,"Cheez-ah, cheez-ah, cheez-ah, cheez-ah, cheez-ah, cheez-ah."
00:10:07,00:10:09,"It's like piss, piss-sink, I guess."
00:10:09,00:10:11,"Oh, not the sound that comes out,"
00:10:11,00:10:13,because I'd see a doctor if it's saying cheez-ah.
00:10:13,00:10:15,I'm not sure.
00:10:15,00:10:16,I think the first two are good.
00:10:16,00:10:18,I don't quite understand that last one.
00:10:18,00:10:22,I think actually maybe the word piss is quite onomatopoeic.
00:10:22,00:10:23,"Oh, yeah."
00:10:23,00:10:24,"It's quite fluid, isn't it?"
00:10:24,00:10:25,"You're right, yes."
00:10:25,00:10:27,Do you know the word bum is onomatopoeic?
00:10:27,00:10:30,"You mean our word, bum, that word itself."
00:10:30,00:10:33,"Oh, because it looks like a, the B on the M."
00:10:33,00:10:34,That's not real.
00:10:34,00:10:36,Onomatopoeic means it makes the noise.
00:10:36,00:10:37,Yes.
00:10:37,00:10:40,"So it's like a fat noise, basically."
00:10:40,00:10:43,Interesting.
00:10:43,00:10:44,"That's called the OED, anyway."
00:10:44,00:10:47,"What's it called then, what I've just mentioned,"
00:10:47,00:10:49,when a word looks like the object?
00:10:49,00:10:51,I don't know if there's a word for that.
00:10:51,00:10:53,I think it's called being made up.
00:10:53,00:10:55,"Bed looks a bit like a bed,"
00:10:55,00:10:57,"because you've got the two posts at either end,"
00:10:57,00:11:00,and then you've got the curly mattress going all the way along.
00:11:00,00:11:04,"And famously, Dan said that the word golf looks like"
00:11:04,00:11:06,"someone playing golf, because the O is the ball,"
00:11:06,00:11:09,"and the L is the club, and the F is the flag."
00:11:09,00:11:13,"The word string looks like a long piece of string,"
00:11:13,00:11:14,if you laid it out in the shape of the word string.
00:11:14,00:11:20,We need a word for this.
00:11:20,00:11:21,"Susie Dent, if there isn't one, make it up."
00:11:21,00:11:26,"They have strong links with the UK, actually, the Basque people,"
00:11:26,00:11:27,because there used to be ships
00:11:27,00:11:30,"which would import English coal to the Basque region,"
00:11:30,00:11:31,and then the sons of the Basque bourgeoisie
00:11:31,00:11:33,would go to England to be educated.
00:11:33,00:11:36,"And that, James, is it true that there is a club"
00:11:36,00:11:38,called Athletic Club Bilbao?
00:11:38,00:11:44,"Oh, yeah, one of the biggest football teams in Spain."
00:11:44,00:11:44,There we go.
00:11:44,00:11:47,"I think that team is because of that link with the UK,"
00:11:47,00:11:51,"with England, which had obviously where football was being developed."
00:11:51,00:11:51,Right.
00:11:51,00:11:53,I think it's Athletic Bilbao.
00:11:53,00:11:54,"It's one of them down there,"
00:11:54,00:11:58,"where they only have Basque footballers who play for them,"
00:11:58,00:12:00,"certainly until very recently,"
00:12:00,00:12:05,"that you had to live within or be born within 10 miles of the ground,"
00:12:05,00:12:06,otherwise you couldn't play for them.
00:12:06,00:12:07,Pretty sure that's right.
00:12:07,00:12:09,Nice.
00:12:09,00:12:11,"We used to get a lot of Basque iron from there,"
00:12:11,00:12:16,and they had the best iron in the world in the Basque country.
00:12:16,00:12:21,"In Hamlet, there is a line which is the mutinies in the Bilboes,"
00:12:21,00:12:23,"and they're referring to the shackles,"
00:12:23,00:12:25,the Bilboes are the shackles that prisoners are using
00:12:25,00:12:26,when they're in a boat.
00:12:27,00:12:31,"And that word Bilboe comes from the city of Bilbao,"
00:12:31,00:12:33,which is one of the biggest cities in the Basque region.
00:12:33,00:12:37,"And actually, it also is where Bilbao Baggins gets his name."
00:12:37,00:12:40,"Yeah, get out."
00:12:40,00:12:41,"Yeah, named after Bilbao,"
00:12:41,00:12:44,"because I think that Tolkien got it from Shakespeare,"
00:12:44,00:12:46,but Shakespeare got it from the city.
00:12:46,00:12:46,Right.
00:12:46,00:12:47,That's terrific.
00:12:47,00:12:49,Bilbao Baggins.
00:12:49,00:12:53,"He's a bit cooler, isn't he?"
00:12:53,00:12:53,Yeah.
00:12:53,00:12:54,Bilbao Baggins.
00:12:54,00:12:56,He's staying up late.
00:12:56,00:12:58,He's having some delicious pintos.
00:12:58,00:13:00,He's got a sexy Spanish accent.
00:13:00,00:13:01,I like him better.
00:13:01,00:13:05,Can I just tell you one more thing about a Canadian lake?
00:13:05,00:13:10,"There is a lake with an island in it,"
00:13:10,00:13:12,and the island in the lake is bigger than the lake.
00:13:12,00:13:16,"Okay, sorry."
00:13:16,00:13:19,Mannequaguan Reservoir.
00:13:19,00:13:20,It's in Quebec.
00:13:20,00:13:22,Just how can that be?
00:13:22,00:13:24,"So it's a ring, quite a ring around."
00:13:24,00:13:26,It's a ring around.
00:13:26,00:13:26,Basically.
00:13:26,00:13:27,It's an annular lake.
00:13:27,00:13:31,"So basically it was created by a meteorite,"
00:13:31,00:13:33,and then there was an upswell of land.
00:13:33,00:13:37,"So it's like a circular island and then a circular lake,"
00:13:37,00:13:40,"but the lake is only just wider than the island,"
00:13:40,00:13:42,"so the water is just the ring around it,"
00:13:42,00:13:43,if that makes sense.
00:13:43,00:13:44,Very cool.
00:13:44,00:13:46,It's like a kids' water park.
00:13:46,00:13:47,Like a kids' water park.
00:13:47,00:13:49,But how is the island bigger than the...
00:13:49,00:13:53,"Because the area of the lake is only the bit where the water is,"
00:13:53,00:13:55,which just goes around in the bend of water.
00:13:55,00:13:56,"Okay, okay."
00:13:56,00:13:58,I thought you were saying that the island had grown
00:13:58,00:14:02,like a mushroom and expanded beyond the lake.
00:14:02,00:14:04,"Well, the other thing is that..."
00:14:04,00:14:05,"No, I didn't say that."
00:14:05,00:14:07,"But the other thing is that there's like a little mountain on it,"
00:14:07,00:14:11,"so the surface area of the island would be more as well,"
00:14:11,00:14:13,because it goes upwards as well as flowers.
00:14:13,00:14:13,That's very cool.
00:14:13,00:14:15,"Anyway, that's nice to think."
00:14:15,00:14:17,"That's where the water slide would go,"
00:14:17,00:14:20,"top of the mountain, slide into the circular..."
00:14:20,00:14:21,The rubber ring.
00:14:21,00:14:22,The Lazy River.
00:14:22,00:14:23,"The Lazy River, thank you."
00:14:24,00:14:27,"Baseball players also love sunflower seeds, apparently,"
00:14:27,00:14:32,"in the USA, to such an extent that Major League Baseball"
00:14:32,00:14:35,had to ban sunflower seed eating during 2020.
00:14:35,00:14:35,Why?
00:14:35,00:14:37,Covid.
00:14:37,00:14:37,Covid.
00:14:37,00:14:43,That's the answer to any question where the word 2020 is in there.
00:14:43,00:14:48,"James, next time I'd appreciate a bit more hamming and hoeing."
00:14:48,00:14:50,The littler!
00:14:52,00:14:55,Was it something to do with the first six weeks of 2020?
00:14:55,00:14:59,It was because players were spitting.
00:14:59,00:15:01,"When they chew, then they spit,"
00:15:01,00:15:02,"and that was cracked down on,"
00:15:02,00:15:05,"and they said, ""We can't trust you to eat sunflower seeds and not spit."""
00:15:05,00:15:09,"They also banned after-game showers, I presume, for the same reason."
00:15:09,00:15:10,Because they spit in them?
00:15:10,00:15:12,"No, I don't, sorry."
00:15:12,00:15:14,"Too COVID-y, I guess."
00:15:14,00:15:14,Too COVID-y.
00:15:14,00:15:15,Too sexy.
00:15:15,00:15:17,Too sexy.
00:15:17,00:15:18,"I don't think that was the worry, was it?"
00:15:19,00:15:21,A communal after-game showers?
00:15:21,00:15:23,I think you were allowed to have a shower by yourself.
00:15:23,00:15:24,I don't know.
00:15:24,00:15:26,It wasn't too sexy.
00:15:26,00:15:29,It wasn't like they couldn't help snogging each other as soon as they go in.
00:15:29,00:15:31,I don't know what you think happens after a sporting event.
00:15:31,00:15:35,I have never been close enough to a sporting event to find out.
00:15:35,00:15:38,"Is that as soon as the finder whistle goes, everyone's kicked off."
00:15:38,00:15:39,I'm making it up.
00:15:39,00:15:40,"So far, everyone."
00:15:40,00:15:46,"Dylan Thomas and his wife, Caitlyn,"
00:15:46,00:15:49,"they're an open relationship, so they were sleeping left, right and centre."
00:15:49,00:15:50,They're three kids together and Caitlyn...
00:15:50,00:15:51,"With other people, right?"
00:15:51,00:15:51,Yeah.
00:15:51,00:15:52,"They were just sleeping, right?"
00:15:52,00:15:56,"I quite like the idea of an open relationship,"
00:15:56,00:15:57,if it means you get to sleep a lot.
00:15:57,00:15:58,Absolutely.
00:15:58,00:15:59,That sounds lovely.
00:15:59,00:16:02,"Yeah, going around with a mattress strapped to your back."
00:16:02,00:16:03,This is just for naps.
00:16:03,00:16:05,Was it definitely open?
00:16:05,00:16:09,I thought they always got pissed off with each other when the other one had affairs.
00:16:09,00:16:10,I think he did a lot of womanising.
00:16:10,00:16:11,He did shed loads of womanising.
00:16:11,00:16:12,I don't know how much she did.
00:16:12,00:16:13,She did a bunch.
00:16:13,00:16:17,"She said it was a miracle that her three kids were the children of Dylan,"
00:16:17,00:16:19,because it was touch and go.
00:16:19,00:16:21,But I think it wasn't an open relationship.
00:16:21,00:16:22,"If you're only touching and going,"
00:16:22,00:16:24,it's not going to be the other guy's kids.
00:16:24,00:16:26,"Sounded out how it works, that's what Finn said too."
00:16:26,00:16:26,Okay.
00:16:26,00:16:29,"But do you remember those TV shows that used to be on,"
00:16:29,00:16:31,"where you'd call up in the middle of the night,"
00:16:31,00:16:33,"and it would be a competition,"
00:16:33,00:16:35,you entered and you'd win a car or something?
00:16:35,00:16:36,"Well, you'd never win."
00:16:36,00:16:39,"Well, so there was one where there was this old man on the phone,"
00:16:39,00:16:43,he got through and it was always really easy quiz questions.
00:16:43,00:16:44,"And the question was like,"
00:16:44,00:16:46,"""You'll win a car if you answer this,"
00:16:46,00:16:50,"just tell me one word that starts with the word under."""
00:16:50,00:16:53,"And this old man went, ""Under milk would."""
00:16:53,00:16:58,And he didn't win the car because it's not a word.
00:16:58,00:16:59,No.
00:16:59,00:17:00,It's not a word.
00:17:00,00:17:01,"All right, it's under pressure."
00:17:01,00:17:04,Also not a word.
00:17:04,00:17:04,What?
00:17:04,00:17:06,Cool.
00:17:06,00:17:07,Number three.
00:17:07,00:17:14,"Singaporeans long hair, a famous band."
00:17:14,00:17:17,Back when long hair was a symbol of resistance to the man.
00:17:17,00:17:17,Hippies.
00:17:17,00:17:18,What year?
00:17:18,00:17:18,Hippies.
00:17:18,00:17:20,"Yeah, so do you know when that, roughly when it stopped?"
00:17:20,00:17:22,"Yeah, when it stopped."
00:17:22,00:17:23,I think it would have stopped in the early 80s.
00:17:23,00:17:24,Okay.
00:17:24,00:17:26,"It happened, it stopped in the late 80s."
00:17:26,00:17:27,Was it late 80s?
00:17:27,00:17:29,Around the time of the war on piss.
00:17:29,00:17:30,Oh yeah.
00:17:30,00:17:31,"Maybe once they entered the band,"
00:17:31,00:17:35,they thought we freed up our judicial resources to wage war on left-wing.
00:17:35,00:17:39,"Yeah, there was a Japanese guy called Kitaro,"
00:17:39,00:17:43,who was forced to cancel a gig in 1984 because of his long hair.
00:17:43,00:17:43,Was he?
00:17:43,00:17:46,"And the BG's famously had to, they were given,"
00:17:46,00:17:49,"you could sometimes get a pass, a long hair pass."
00:17:49,00:17:51,"And I think one year they came to do a gig,"
00:17:51,00:17:52,and they got 48 hour pass.
00:17:52,00:17:54,"Because basically they didn't want Singapore in,"
00:17:54,00:17:56,Singapore didn't want its own people.
00:17:56,00:17:59,"It just seems like after 46 hours,"
00:17:59,00:18:00,someone's chasing you with some clippers.
00:18:00,00:18:02,Looks like Cinderella.
00:18:02,00:18:08,"They're running, they're running to the gates of the airport."
00:18:08,00:18:10,The wonderful airport.
00:18:11,00:18:13,Followed by the citizen man.
00:18:13,00:18:15,What was the result of them if they got busted?
00:18:15,00:18:17,"Like, how bad is the..."
00:18:17,00:18:19,"It does, I think you've got a large final,"
00:18:19,00:18:20,you've got a forced to cut off your hair.
00:18:20,00:18:22,"Oh okay, not death sentence."
00:18:22,00:18:23,They're just running away.
00:18:23,00:18:26,Not staying alive.
00:18:26,00:18:27,"Not staying alive, indeed."
00:18:27,00:18:30,"Yeah, I don't think death sentence for the BG's was there really."
00:18:30,00:18:34,"But then the next year, they weren't given a pass."
00:18:34,00:18:36,So I think it might have all been a ploy this lot
00:18:36,00:18:39,to stop the BG's coming back after they didn't like them the first time.
00:18:40,00:18:43,"There was, if you ever needed the government for anything,"
00:18:43,00:18:48,"so let's say you needed to get some social security,"
00:18:48,00:18:52,or you needed someone to help you with some building permit
00:18:52,00:18:53,"or something, there would be signs that said"
00:18:53,00:18:56,"""Males with long hair will be attended to last."""
00:18:56,00:18:58,So you just go to the back of the queue.
00:18:58,00:19:01,"Ouch, interesting."
00:19:01,00:19:04,"And long hair, the definition is quite stringent."
00:19:04,00:19:05,All the Beatles would have failed.
00:19:05,00:19:09,"It's like long hair is the definition is if it covers your ears,"
00:19:09,00:19:11,or if it touches your eyebrows.
00:19:11,00:19:11,Interesting.
00:19:11,00:19:14,"So Dan, I think if you didn't juice up your hair,"
00:19:14,00:19:15,or whatever it is you do with that front bit.
00:19:15,00:19:16,"I'd juice it up, yeah."
00:19:16,00:19:19,I think that might have stretched your eyebrows.
00:19:19,00:19:23,"I wonder if that would trick them though,"
00:19:23,00:19:26,"if you could, if you did juice it up into a quiff"
00:19:26,00:19:27,as you went through security.
00:19:27,00:19:27,"Yeah, I don't think so."
00:19:27,00:19:28,I think they see through that.
00:19:28,00:19:29,They probably see through.
00:19:29,00:19:30,Or maybe a cool horn.
00:19:30,00:19:32,"Yeah, yeah, I mean it is."
00:19:32,00:19:33,And you didn't go on.
00:19:33,00:19:34,How interesting.
00:19:34,00:19:37,"You know, if you were in a public toilet in Singapore,"
00:19:37,00:19:38,you were legally required to flush.
00:19:39,00:19:40,Really?
00:19:40,00:19:40,"Okay, yes."
00:19:40,00:19:42,Like still to this day.
00:19:42,00:19:43,I believe so.
00:19:43,00:19:44,"Yeah, right."
00:19:44,00:19:45,"It is, it is in the rule."
00:19:45,00:19:50,"The, I saw that and the fine from first fence is up to a thousand pounds."
00:19:50,00:19:56,"But there is a further thing that says that it is $5,000 for every day"
00:19:56,00:20:01,or part thereof during which the offense continues after conviction.
00:20:01,00:20:04,"So in theory, if you go for a wee and you don't flush,"
00:20:04,00:20:08,"and then no one else uses that toilet for like three weeks,"
00:20:08,00:20:11,you'd have to pay $500 for each time in theory.
00:20:11,00:20:14,"Do they, do they rope it off and say you have to,"
00:20:14,00:20:17,you have to be the one to go back and do it?
00:20:17,00:20:21,"In actual fact, that bit of the law is due to another part of the,"
00:20:21,00:20:23,it's a public sanitation law.
00:20:23,00:20:25,And that part is referring really to something else.
00:20:25,00:20:29,"It's like, you know, people digging up pipes when they shouldn't be."
00:20:29,00:20:31,"But technically, like according to the law,"
00:20:31,00:20:34,"if you don't flush and no one flushes it for a year,"
00:20:35,00:20:38,"you'd have to pay $180,000."
00:20:38,00:20:42,And are there exemptions if it's the middle of the night
00:20:42,00:20:43,and you didn't want to wake anyone up?
00:20:43,00:20:46,I think that's fine.
00:20:46,00:20:50,Did you hear about the experimental lakes area in Canada?
00:20:50,00:20:50,I love this.
00:20:50,00:20:51,No.
00:20:51,00:20:52,Canada has so many lakes.
00:20:52,00:20:57,"They have set aside 58 in Ontario alone, specifically for scientific research."
00:20:57,00:21:01,And they've spent 50 years studying these 58 lakes.
00:21:01,00:21:05,"And it's like a, it's like a scientific playground basically."
00:21:05,00:21:09,So they study acid rain and they study algae blooms.
00:21:09,00:21:14,"And they, in 2018, they spilled 90 gallons of oil"
00:21:14,00:21:15,into one of the lakes on purpose.
00:21:15,00:21:17,"Because when you have an oil spill,"
00:21:17,00:21:19,normally people just rush there with like cotton buds
00:21:19,00:21:22,and try and clean up the birds and clean up the oil and all of that.
00:21:22,00:21:24,"They were trying to work out how it moves,"
00:21:24,00:21:26,"how do you deal with it, that kind of thing."
00:21:26,00:21:29,Maybe it just sorts itself out.
00:21:29,00:21:31,"Maybe it just sorts itself out and that's what they found,"
00:21:31,00:21:33,that we've been wasting our time cleaning it up.
00:21:33,00:21:35,"Or estrogen going into the water,"
00:21:35,00:21:38,like synthetic estrogen in sort of medicines and things like that.
00:21:38,00:21:40,What does that do to fish?
00:21:40,00:21:40,Yes.
00:21:40,00:21:43,Because it changes the sex of loads of fish and all of this.
00:21:43,00:21:45,So they're like crash test dummy lakes
00:21:45,00:21:48,that have massively improved water quality across the whole planet.
00:21:48,00:21:49,Interesting.
00:21:49,00:21:52,Because the results can be found and spread across the world.
00:21:52,00:21:53,It's really cool.
00:21:53,00:21:54,Nice.
00:21:54,00:21:56,"Well, there's also this lake which is super scientifically important"
00:21:56,00:22:01,because it seems to represent how humans have messed up the world.
00:22:01,00:22:07,This is also in Canada and this is called Crawford Lake.
00:22:07,00:22:09,It's 24 meters deep but it's quite small.
00:22:09,00:22:11,"And this is when, you know, there's this big debate"
00:22:11,00:22:13,about whether we're in the Anthropocene era yet.
00:22:13,00:22:17,"And so we, the Holocene has been in a few thousand years"
00:22:17,00:22:19,and then the Anthropocene is defined as the epoch
00:22:19,00:22:22,where humans are having the biggest effect on the environment.
00:22:22,00:22:24,"And every new era, I didn't know this,"
00:22:24,00:22:28,"every new era has to have a location, a place that represents it."
00:22:28,00:22:32,"And it was decided this tiny little lake in Ontario, Crawford Lake,"
00:22:32,00:22:36,"represented it because it's so deep, it's so small,"
00:22:36,00:22:39,that the bottom waters don't mix with the top waters.
00:22:39,00:22:42,So all the sediment that's been laid down on it over the years
00:22:42,00:22:43,doesn't get messed around.
00:22:43,00:22:45,"So if you take a big bit of segment,"
00:22:45,00:22:47,"a big cross section of sediment and look on it,"
00:22:47,00:22:49,you can see the mark of humans.
00:22:49,00:22:52,So the first nuclear test immediately appears
00:22:52,00:22:53,in your study of the sediment.
00:22:53,00:22:55,"When fossil fuels started to be increased in use,"
00:22:55,00:22:57,that immediately appears in the sediment.
00:22:57,00:23:01,"So there's a big thing, is Crawford Lake the start of the new epoch?"
00:23:01,00:23:02,"And they've decided that, no, it's not."
00:23:02,00:23:04,"Right, okay."
00:23:04,00:23:06,So they've decided we're not in the Anthropocene yet.
00:23:06,00:23:08,We're not in the Anthropocene yet.
00:23:08,00:23:10,"If we were, it would be Crawford Lake, but apparently we're not."
00:23:10,00:23:12,I feel like if they went for another lake
00:23:12,00:23:13,"that wasn't in the middle of nowhere,"
00:23:13,00:23:16,they might have worked out that actually we are in it.
00:23:16,00:23:18,"Well, we would have got more press at least."
00:23:18,00:23:22,"Yeah, if they had gone to the Aral Sea or something."
00:23:22,00:23:23,"Yeah, yeah."
00:23:23,00:23:24,Yes.
00:23:24,00:23:27,"Or somewhere where, you know, it's all dried up"
00:23:27,00:23:29,or there's just radiation there or something.
00:23:29,00:23:32,They're really strict about the definition of a new epoch.
00:23:32,00:23:33,"Yeah, yes."
00:23:33,00:23:35,"Yeah, it's a big deal, isn't it?"
00:23:35,00:23:37,"Exactly, you can't just go naming them Willy Nilly."
00:23:37,00:23:38,It does feel like we're there though.
00:23:38,00:23:43,"Um, oh, one of us, one of us around this table"
00:23:43,00:23:45,will have had it more.
00:23:45,00:23:45,Golfers.
00:23:45,00:23:47,"I'm afraid not, James, let's sit back down."
00:23:47,00:23:52,"Will have had more, sorry, they experienced Paridolium."
00:23:52,00:23:54,Will have experienced more Paridolia.
00:23:54,00:23:56,And can we guess it based on knowledge of each other?
00:23:56,00:23:56,Absolutely.
00:23:56,00:23:59,"It's got to be, I bet, golfers, idiots, or women."
00:23:59,00:24:03,Don't feel like that.
00:24:03,00:24:05,"Um, maybe, maybe."
00:24:05,00:24:06,James has ruled out.
00:24:06,00:24:07,"Oh, okay."
00:24:07,00:24:11,Will James have it less because of his Affentasia thing?
00:24:11,00:24:12,Face blindness.
00:24:12,00:24:14,I don't know whether that means James has it less.
00:24:14,00:24:17,"I mean, he's all the devil in that Picora one time."
00:24:17,00:24:18,So I think he's got it.
00:24:18,00:24:19,Okay.
00:24:19,00:24:21,I'll try and find the picture of that Picora
00:24:21,00:24:22,and put it on my Instagram.
00:24:22,00:24:23,Please do.
00:24:23,00:24:25,Is it me because I wear glasses
00:24:25,00:24:27,"and the lenses might give me little,"
00:24:27,00:24:29,little different glamourizing?
00:24:29,00:24:30,"No, it's not."
00:24:30,00:24:32,"So let's, can we please wrap this up?"
00:24:32,00:24:33,"Yes, all right."
00:24:33,00:24:34,It's got to be women.
00:24:34,00:24:35,I have two guesses.
00:24:35,00:24:36,It's not just women.
00:24:36,00:24:37,Is it people who eat sushi on the train?
00:24:37,00:24:41,You normally see the back of people's heads
00:24:41,00:24:44,as they walk away along the carriage from you.
00:24:44,00:24:46,"No, it's mums."
00:24:46,00:24:49,It's mums.
00:24:49,00:24:51,"It's, it's, this is a study in a biology letter."
00:24:51,00:24:55,"Scientists showed 380 women, a collection of images,"
00:24:55,00:24:57,and the women who had given birth in the last year
00:24:57,00:25:00,were likely to see faces
00:25:00,00:25:03,and to perceive more face-like images in what they saw.
00:25:03,00:25:06,And that might be due to more oxytocin.
00:25:06,00:25:09,"We don't know, but it might be sort of like"
00:25:09,00:25:10,the primitive nurturing instinct.
00:25:10,00:25:11,"They always say it's oxytocin, don't they?"
00:25:11,00:25:13,"It's like, oh, my feet hurt."
00:25:13,00:25:14,"Yeah, it's oxytocin."
00:25:14,00:25:15,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:25:15,00:25:17,But babies have it too.
00:25:17,00:25:19,So babies will spend longer looking at collections
00:25:19,00:25:20,of dots and dashes that look a bit like a face
00:25:20,00:25:21,"than random dots and dashes,"
00:25:21,00:25:23,even after a few minutes of life.
00:25:23,00:25:26,"So it's a really deep program thing,"
00:25:26,00:25:27,this face-finding software.
00:25:27,00:25:29,"In fact, even before life,"
00:25:29,00:25:30,"depending on when you think life starts,"
00:25:30,00:25:33,abortions can't make this piece so much easier.
00:25:33,00:25:35,I don't want the inbox.
00:25:35,00:25:37,"We have, the inbox is a busy place, Hannah."
00:25:37,00:25:38,I'm so sorry.
00:25:38,00:25:39,Yep.
00:25:39,00:25:42,"Even before they're born, babies have it,"
00:25:42,00:25:43,"which I find extraordinary,"
00:25:43,00:25:44,"because they've never seen a face,"
00:25:44,00:25:47,"but they did an experiment a few years ago,"
00:25:47,00:25:51,"where they shone a triangle of three lights,"
00:25:51,00:25:53,"three lit dots, a woman's uterus, basically,"
00:25:53,00:25:54,"through her skin,"
00:25:54,00:25:57,and they monitored what the fetus was doing inside.
00:25:57,00:25:59,And if the triangle has the two dots on the top
00:25:59,00:26:00,"and the one dot on the bottom,"
00:26:00,00:26:02,then the fetus would move around
00:26:02,00:26:04,and crane its head towards it to look at it.
00:26:04,00:26:06,But if it had the two dots on the bottom
00:26:06,00:26:08,"and the one dot at the top,"
00:26:08,00:26:09,"so oriented not like a face,"
00:26:09,00:26:11,the fetus wouldn't care.
00:26:11,00:26:11,Wow.
00:26:11,00:26:14,And it's never seen a face.
00:26:14,00:26:15,"That's, yeah."
00:26:15,00:26:16,What's going on there?
00:26:16,00:26:17,Unless it's got a mirror in there.
00:26:17,00:26:19,What is going on there?
00:26:19,00:26:21,"Do they have to put it upside down,"
00:26:21,00:26:23,because babies are sometimes upside down in the womb?
00:26:23,00:26:24,"That's a really good point they must have,"
00:26:24,00:26:25,wasn't they?
00:26:25,00:26:25,Yeah.
00:26:25,00:26:27,"Otherwise, the experiment is a complete wash."
00:26:27,00:26:28,"Oh, my God, Andy."
00:26:28,00:26:29,You should write to them and check.
00:26:29,00:26:35,"A lot of people seem to leave bomb threats on sick bags,"
00:26:35,00:26:38,which seems quite an annoying thing to do.
00:26:38,00:26:42,"Over the years, there are constant articles of..."
00:26:43,00:26:46,"Someone is misspelled, so I think in 2017,"
00:26:46,00:26:49,"there's a fight from Sydney that had to be completely evacuated,"
00:26:49,00:26:52,"because a bag said B-O-M, which doesn't..."
00:26:52,00:26:54,I don't know if you just seem they even meant bomb.
00:26:54,00:26:55,There was another one that was found...
00:26:55,00:26:55,Wait a minute.
00:26:55,00:26:57,Was that not the one where they were going to Bombay?
00:26:57,00:27:01,I'm sure there was one that that happened once.
00:27:01,00:27:01,Really?
00:27:01,00:27:02,"Yeah, yeah."
00:27:02,00:27:05,"They wrote sort of like, M-A-N to B-O-M,"
00:27:05,00:27:07,"because it was Manchester to Mumbai,"
00:27:07,00:27:09,and they saw the bomb and they thought it was a bomb.
00:27:09,00:27:10,That's really funny.
00:27:10,00:27:11,I think these guys were going to
00:27:12,00:27:14,"not Bombay, but I can't imagine that would have happened."
00:27:14,00:27:15,Can I check?
00:27:15,00:27:19,Is this people who are getting off a plane
00:27:19,00:27:21,and are playing a kind of sick prank as they leave?
00:27:21,00:27:23,They just write the word bomb on the sick bag and then they get off?
00:27:23,00:27:24,"We think so, yes."
00:27:24,00:27:26,Which I thought the cleaners did a better job than that.
00:27:26,00:27:29,"But yes, it is, because there was another one that was found"
00:27:29,00:27:32,"just after a flight had taken off from Sydney in 2004,"
00:27:32,00:27:35,"and someone found a sick bag in the toilet that said, ""Bob."""
00:27:35,00:27:39,Which I just think is someone naming their bag.
00:27:39,00:27:41,"Well, yeah, it's two dyslexic people,"
00:27:41,00:27:44,"because both are spelled bomb wrong in both case, right?"
00:27:44,00:27:45,"Well, yeah."
00:27:45,00:27:47,One's missing the M and the other's missing the...
00:27:47,00:27:48,"Yeah, I mean, yes."
00:27:48,00:27:50,"But I mean, it could be that they weren't even trying to spell ""Bob."""
00:27:50,00:27:52,"In fact, so the plane had to turn around,"
00:27:52,00:27:53,had to be completely evacuated and landed back.
00:27:53,00:27:54,"Because they wrote ""Bob"" on a bag!"
00:27:54,00:27:56,"Because they wrote ""Bob"" on a bag!"
00:27:56,00:27:58,I don't know.
00:27:58,00:28:01,"I know, it does seem over-cautious, doesn't it?"
00:28:01,00:28:02,And the stewards and stewardesses said afterwards
00:28:02,00:28:04,"that actually, apparently,"
00:28:04,00:28:07,"they commonly use the letters B-O-B anyway,"
00:28:07,00:28:09,"a slang for best on board,"
00:28:09,00:28:11,"meaning ""fitty"" in Isle Sever."
00:28:11,00:28:12,Oh!
00:28:12,00:28:14,"So actually, it could have just been a stewardess, right?"
00:28:14,00:28:16,"People are always calling me ""Bob"" on the planes."
00:28:16,00:28:18,"Yeah, that's why."
00:28:18,00:28:20,That's why I'm the fittest one on the plane.
00:28:20,00:28:20,Yeah.
00:28:20,00:28:22,But you also charter your own flights everywhere
00:28:22,00:28:23,and you're the only passenger.
00:28:23,00:28:26,"These are the helicopter flights with your wife,"
00:28:26,00:28:26,or it's just you two.
00:28:26,00:28:32,"Do you know, there's a really cool thing that you can see online"
00:28:32,00:28:33,"called lightningmap.org,"
00:28:33,00:28:36,and it shows you where basically every lightning strike
00:28:36,00:28:37,is happening live on our planet right now.
00:28:37,00:28:39,Where's our closest lightning star?
00:28:40,00:28:41,Dan's actually got the app open right now.
00:28:41,00:28:43,The closest to us.
00:28:43,00:28:43,"Yeah, yeah."
00:28:43,00:28:45,Let me make my way back to...
00:28:45,00:28:46,"No, no."
00:28:46,00:28:48,"If Panama's there, we're in the other direction."
00:28:48,00:28:48,"Yeah, yeah."
00:28:48,00:28:49,I was...
00:28:49,00:28:50,Dan's going the longer way.
00:28:50,00:28:51,"I was going, I was going, yeah."
00:28:51,00:28:57,Don't police.
00:28:57,00:29:00,The route Dan thinks it's best to get from Panama to the UK.
00:29:00,00:29:00,"Yeah, man."
00:29:00,00:29:02,"Well, you're going to fall off the end-of-flat-earth dream."
00:29:02,00:29:04,"Ooh, it goes right round, mate."
00:29:04,00:29:05,"Now, that's South Africa."
00:29:05,00:29:06,I'm trying because I'm trying to bring...
00:29:06,00:29:07,I'm trying to do this...
00:29:07,00:29:09,The pinchy thing to get it in.
00:29:09,00:29:10,Come on.
00:29:10,00:29:14,"Oh, Columbus missed out not having you on board, mate."
00:29:14,00:29:17,"All right, here we go."
00:29:17,00:29:17,"Okay, we got it, we got it."
00:29:17,00:29:18,Here we go.
00:29:18,00:29:20,Okay.
00:29:20,00:29:22,This absolutely captivating audio.
00:29:22,00:29:25,I can see some in...
00:29:25,00:29:27,It's all in a different language.
00:29:27,00:29:30,That's in Albania.
00:29:30,00:29:31,"Oh, nice."
00:29:31,00:29:31,"All right, look at..."
00:29:31,00:29:33,"If you're listening in Albania to us live,"
00:29:33,00:29:37,"as this is going out, then watch out."
00:29:37,00:29:38,A South of Tirana.
00:29:38,00:29:39,"Oh, really?"
00:29:39,00:29:41,"So if you're in the North, you're cool."
00:29:41,00:29:41,Okay.
00:29:41,00:29:43,"Apparently, we get 40 strikes every second,"
00:29:43,00:29:48,"so more than 3 million lightning strikes per day on Earth,"
00:29:48,00:29:49,which is a lot.
00:29:49,00:29:52,The worst sick bag of all time.
00:29:52,00:29:56,"This is, according to expert Danny Cahalan from Sydney."
00:29:56,00:29:58,"He's another baggist, I believe."
00:29:58,00:30:00,He said the worst ever design was the 1970s.
00:30:00,00:30:01,It's called the sick sack.
00:30:01,00:30:04,"And the problem is it's in an envelope itself,"
00:30:04,00:30:06,which makes it quite fiddly.
00:30:06,00:30:09,"Like, you're fiddling, you're getting a bag out of an envelope,"
00:30:09,00:30:09,you're opening...
00:30:09,00:30:12,"You know, it's often a quite old-time pressurized situation"
00:30:12,00:30:13,if you're throwing up on a flight.
00:30:13,00:30:15,"Yeah, you don't want to be opening."
00:30:15,00:30:16,"You don't want to have to get your letter opener out, do you?"
00:30:16,00:30:21,"In 1928, they tried anti-air-sickness fumes"
00:30:21,00:30:23,throughout aeroplanes.
00:30:23,00:30:23,Interesting.
00:30:23,00:30:23,Really?
00:30:23,00:30:27,And that was a mixture of oxygen and cinnamon smell.
00:30:27,00:30:28,"Oh, lovely."
00:30:28,00:30:29,And hopefully not tonka bean.
00:30:29,00:30:32,"But they would send it through the plane,"
00:30:32,00:30:35,and the idea was it would stop people from feeling sick.
00:30:35,00:30:35,Really?
00:30:36,00:30:36,Did it work?
00:30:36,00:30:39,"Well, we don't have it today, do we?"
00:30:39,00:30:40,"I don't think so, really."
00:30:40,00:30:41,"I think, really, in those days,"
00:30:41,00:30:43,people didn't really know what caused it.
00:30:43,00:30:47,There was an article by a sum fund called the Guggenheim Fund
00:30:47,00:30:49,who claimed that it was a psychological state.
00:30:49,00:30:52,"So, as in, it was just all in your head,"
00:30:52,00:30:55,and it could be cured by an increase in confidence in flyers.
00:30:55,00:30:58,"Maybe, I think I sort of buy that."
00:30:58,00:30:59,Do you?
00:30:59,00:31:00,"No, trouble sickness is real."
00:31:00,00:31:02,Definitely it is.
00:31:02,00:31:03,"But I just think if I'm nervous,"
00:31:03,00:31:05,I'm likely to throw up on any given day.
00:31:05,00:31:06,That's fair enough.
00:31:06,00:31:08,That's why you vomit before the forecast every second.
00:31:08,00:31:09,Every week.
00:31:09,00:31:11,Grandmaster Flash collects mugs.
00:31:11,00:31:13,No way.
00:31:13,00:31:13,Yeah?
00:31:13,00:31:15,"He's got 5,000, he says, in a special room."
00:31:15,00:31:17,"And he says, ""The room temperature is correct."""
00:31:17,00:31:18,What?
00:31:18,00:31:21,"Just room temperature, isn't it?"
00:31:21,00:31:27,Mugs don't have an incredibly narrow range of temperatures
00:31:27,00:31:28,they can perform in.
00:31:28,00:31:32,The whole point of a mug is that they can go to 100 degrees.
00:31:33,00:31:38,But at least we know it's not like minus 200 degrees
00:31:38,00:31:39,"or plus 5,000 degrees."
00:31:39,00:31:42,He keeps it very carefully between minus 200
00:31:42,00:31:44,"and plus 5,000 degrees in that room."
00:31:44,00:31:47,His room salesman absolutely saw him coming.
00:31:47,00:31:58,"Okay, that's it."
00:31:58,00:31:59,That is all of our outtakes.
00:31:59,00:32:01,"Thanks, everyone."
00:32:01,00:32:03,If you want to write into us about anything
00:32:03,00:32:06,"that we've said during the course of this compilation,"
