00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.200
 Hey, Club Fish members, it is Dan here.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.000
 Welcome to your bonus compilation episode.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.120
 This is all of the outtakes, all of the bloopers,

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.760
 the tangents, basically all the bits

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.760
 that didn't fit into the main narrative of the episodes,

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.400
 but stuff that we didn't wanna get rid of,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.740
 and so we've brought it all together

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.020
 here in one handy compilation.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.200
 But before we get into it,

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.320
 I just wanna remind anyone who hasn't seen the news,

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.280
 we're doing a couple of live shows very soon.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.200
 We are gonna be playing the London Podcast Festival,

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.880
 and the fun thing about this is usually it's just a gig,

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.080
 and I believe the two gigs are actually sold out,

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.400
 if you wanna be there physically.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.520
 However, we're gonna be live streaming the gigs.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.360
 Now in the past, I know this has been really fun,

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.440
 because as you're watching the live stream,

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.160
 you can actually comment underneath

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.520
 as the show's going along.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.280
 It's a really cool way of meeting fellow fish listeners,

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.760
 if you've not done that before.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.680
 So why not check it out?

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.040
 The link is on our website.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.600
 We're doing the fifth and sixth of September.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.560
 We've partially announced the guest,

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.240
 who's gonna be joining us on the sixth,

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.760
 and that is Richard Osman.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.200
 So that's gonna be really awesome.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.360
 We'll be announcing our other guest very soon for the fifth,

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.080
 but as I say, tickets are available.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.880
 You can watch it as it's happening live on stage.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.360
 So we've also got another live show announcement coming up.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.200
 We'll be announcing it at the top of this week's show,

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.480
 so keep a listen out for that,

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.200
 in case it happens to be in a town near you.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.520
 And that's it for the admin.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.560
 So let's get on with it.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.880
 This is a big old chunky compilation episode.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.880
 Here we go.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:51.240
 Yeah, you mentioned Braveheart in this time,

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.640
 and the Battle of Sterling Bridge happened then.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.880
 I like this from Wikipedia.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.600
 The Battle of Sterling Bridge is depicted

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.720
 in the 1995 film Braveheart,

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.400
 but it bears little resemblance to the real battle.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.040
 Most egregiously, there being no bridge.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.160
 But that is the time when supposedly,

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.800
 the Scots lifted their kilts and showed their bums.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.640
 - Interesting.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.880
 - To scare the English,

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.720
 but we have no evidence that that happened.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.800
 There's no contemporary evidence that happened,

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.360
 but we do have a 14th century account

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.120
 of the English doing that against the Scottish.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.360
 - Really? - During those wars.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.720
 - Dropping their trousers. - Yeah.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.760
 - Really? - I don't know.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.880
 - In the Chronicle of Peter Langtoft,

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.200
 they mentioned the English doing that.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.600
 - No way. - I don't know.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.360
 - And did it scare the Scots,

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.520
 or did it make them think, "Oh, open target?"

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.240
 - I think we haven't seen before, you know.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.600
 - Yeah. - We've all got them, you know.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.080
 (laughing)

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.640
 Why are they triangular?

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.640
 - High ends. - Yeah.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.920
 You know how they've got the point at the front?

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.520
 - Yeah. - They shape like a boat, basically.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.360
 - Yes, yeah, good question.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.520
 - I think to carve a route through the clothes,

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.720
 much like a boat through the water.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.280
 If they were shaped the opposite,

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.760
 it would be harder to do the ironing.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.840
 - I think so. - I think so.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.640
 - Why don't you try doing it backwards the next time?

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.040
 - That's a really good idea.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.600
 That's a really good idea.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.760
 - And why is the shape-- - Yeah, why is the shape

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.960
 - I'll end up with my shirt on, back to front.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.040
 That's your nightmare.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.880
 (laughing)

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.120
 - My pants on your head.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.960
 (laughing)

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.920
 - Be frantically searching for the why.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.080
 (laughing)

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.640
 - We used to have double pointed,

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.360
 back to front reversible ones,

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.400
 which would save you having the whole trousers

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.400
 on your head, pullover.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.240
 - I see, like a sort of--

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.440
 - It looked like a leaf, I suppose.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.480
 - Like a canoe.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.520
 - Or a canoe, yes.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.920
 - Keep the bolt analogy going.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.440
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.640
 Which we should do throughout.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.560
 And these were the most popular irons

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.600
 from about 1870 to the 1930s, '40s,

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.760
 when electric irons came in,

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.000
 and they were invented by this woman called Mary Potts.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.080
 So she basically invented the iron

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.240
 that people were using in the late 19th, early 20th century.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.120
 And she got lots of patterns for it.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.960
 So she made it hollow, so it wasn't as heavy.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.840
 And it also didn't get so dangerously hot,

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.880
 'cause she filled the inside with wool

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.400
 or something non-heat conducting,

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.440
 'cause people were constantly burning their hands.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.980
 And she invented the removable handle.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.720
 So you could constantly have,

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.240
 you could be heating up one iron

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.480
 while you were using the other,

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.680
 and then you could swap the iron onto the handle.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.520
 - That's really clever.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.280
 - Oh, wait, why can't they both just have a handle?

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.120
 Sorry, I've been really stupid.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.360
 - 'Cause the handle would probably heat up, right?

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.960
 - Get super hot, yeah. - 'Cause the only way you can't,

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.080
 yeah, it's like when you cook an egg,

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.560
 sometimes that handle, you gotta let go.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.040
 - I don't hold onto the pan

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.840
 all the way through the cooking process.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.480
 - What? - You've got to grip

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.120
 the rim of the pan with both hands, ideally.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.880
 - As the saying goes, a held part always biles.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.440
 - John Harvey Kellogg.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.840
 - Okay. - Oh.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.920
 - Cornflakes pioneer and anti-fiddling around

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.520
 with yourself advocate.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.440
 - Go back to early episodes

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.880
 to see what the hell that's referring to.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.000
 - Yes. - We won't tell you

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.760
 which one, weighing through all 580.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.080
 - I believe he invented an early sunbed.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.360
 He believed it could cure almost everything.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.000
 And there was a big thing of sun therapy,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.480
 and high-altitude sunbathing in particular,

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.800
 'cause it gave you supposedly more unfiltered ultraviolet rays,

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.440
 which was especially good for you at the time,

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.120
 as we now know is not the case.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.320
 - It's weird 'cause there were some truths

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.120
 to this idea at the time.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.280
 I guess Kellogg thought that it filled your skin with blood,

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.160
 which drew blood away from your diseased organs,

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.240
 which wasn't correct.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.960
 But the seventh did, in fact,

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.920
 install one of his sun baths in the palace in 1903,

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.640
 where you sat in a chair, which was fully enclosed,

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.480
 and it had 52 light bulbs around you

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.200
 that could glow any color for different health benefits.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.440
 But at the same time that one of the first Nobel Prizes

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.440
 was awarded for discovering the benefits

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.280
 of light therapy on... - Tobaccoosis.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.480
 - And TB, yeah, exactly. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.760
 - Which was basically true, Niels Finnsen.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.680
 Yeah, and then they opened lots of Solaria,

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.160
 didn't they, all over Europe,

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.600
 which were basically for patients who were sick with stuff

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.000
 where you had these amazing sounding hospitals,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.800
 which the NHS would never fund today,

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.320
 but where you could lie in this room

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.740
 and the entire roof would retract on a sunny day

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.520
 so you could be exposed to the sun.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.600
 Or giant balconies where your whole big bed

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.840
 would be wheeled out onto them.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.840
 And that was good for you.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.520
 But I don't know about the Kellogg shit.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.360
 - I don't know.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.120
 - It doesn't cure gout and constipation like Kellogg claimed.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.700
 (all laughing)

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:26.120
 - If you go to the beach and you get a suntan,

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.640
 then it's mostly due to the sun.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.280
 - Thanks very much. - Carry on, Professor.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.280
 - However, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1% of the radiation

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.160
 comes from stars beyond the galaxy.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.920
 - Oh, that's great.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.640
 - Because it's photons coming from, you know,

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.720
 from outer outer space that come onto our earth.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.560
 And a certain amount of those photons will go into your body

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.560
 and they will cause your body to turn.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.680
 - That's so cool.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.720
 If you get a night suntan,

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.360
 and how, I suppose it would take too long.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.840
 - I think it would take too long,

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.800
 given the number of zeros and that number.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.440
 - So with that photon,

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.000
 that's traveled billions of miles across the universe,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.240
 is that the end point?

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.640
 - Absorbs into your body.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.520
 - You're the end point for this photon.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.680
 - Pretty cool, that is pretty cool.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.520
 - I mean, is that true?

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.360
 Is that what it would be?

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.560
 - Yeah, it would absolve into your body.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.920
 - Wow, I read a thing as well that not only do we get

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.000
 that 0.0, 0.0, whatever it is,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.640
 percentage of our suntan from the stars beyond our sun,

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.360
 but also from the leftover of the Big Bang.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.640
 - Yeah, it's plausible.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.640
 - Tan from the Big Bang, a Bangtan, cool.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.200
 - That's pretty wild. - That's awesome.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.360
 - Really good. - There was another one.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.520
 This one definitely has some kind of meaning to it.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.840
 So in Melanesian legend,

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.480
 they had two gods called Tagaro and Tsukumatua,

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.560
 and they shared the work of creation.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.680
 But whenever Tagaro did something,

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.680
 he did it well, and Tsukumatua did it really badly.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.960
 And so like, when they made trees,

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.080
 Tagaro made really nice food,

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.840
 and Tsukumatua's was really bitter, and stuff like that.

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:04.200
 Like Tsukumatua wanted to have men

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:07.160
 sleep in the trunks of Sego palms,

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.480
 but Tagaro thought, no, they should live in houses instead,

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.680
 and stuff like that.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.840
 And when they created men,

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.880
 Tagaro said that humans should have anuses,

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.240
 but Tsukumatua said, no,

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.680
 they definitely shouldn't have anuses.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.160
 And as a result, the ones that he made,

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.440
 swelled up and burst because they could not defecate.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:32.440
 - And again, is the meaning, do the job properly?

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.080
 Do you work? - I think so.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.840
 - Like, don't half-ass it, literally half-ass it.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.920
 - It's like the yin, don't zero-ass it, yeah.

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.520
 It's like the yin and the yang, right?

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.680
 It's like you always have to have the,

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:45.160
 not good and evil in this case,

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.760
 but sort of good and not very good.

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:49.720
 - Right, right, right.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:50.680
 And it's, yeah, yeah.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.120
 I think we've just invented a new phrase.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.840
 I think we can just say, you've no asked this.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.800
 He's really no asked that project.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.520
 I think that's good.

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.520
 - I think like the Basque language actually is quite good

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.560
 for onomatopoeic words.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.960
 So words that sound like they're supposed to be.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.960
 So, do you know what pill-pill?

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.360
 - Your medicine? - A pill, yeah, two pills.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.200
 No, no, it's onomatopoeic.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.680
 It's gonna sound like the big pill-pill.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:18.040
 Pill-pill, a laser, a laser, a space laser in a film.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.560
 Oh, that would be pew-pew.

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:20.040
 Oh, yes.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.720
 It's the word for boiling liquid.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.600
 Okay, nice, yeah, I see that.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.400
 Terrain, pill-pill.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:25.800
 Terrain.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.720
 Say it again.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.280
 Terrain.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.400
 Terrain.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:29.640
 Terrain.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.320
 Terrain.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.360
 Terrain, terrain.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.840
 Terrain, terrain, terrain, terrain.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:35.960
 It's the pink one, the theme tune.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:36.520
 There we go.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.560
 It's a word for bell-ringing.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.040
 Okay, as in like, to ring, to ring.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.360
 To ring, to ring, to ring, to ring, to ring, to ring, to ring.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.680
 To ring, to ring, to ring, to ring, to ring.

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.360
 And what about this one?

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.320
 Cheez-ah.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.200
 Cheez-ah, cheez-ah, cheez-ah.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.320
 Cheez-ah, cheez-ah, cheez-ah.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.920
 Cheez-ah, cheez-ah, cheez-ah.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.760
 Yes, it's the word for Tom Jones.

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.560
 No. Did he sing that?

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:00.120
 I don't know.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.240
 And it's the word for urinating.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.560
 Cheez-ah, cheez-ah, cheez-ah, cheez-ah, cheez-ah, cheez-ah.

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.480
 It's like piss, piss-sink, I guess.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.080
 Oh, not the sound that comes out,

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.320
 because I'd see a doctor if it's saying cheez-ah.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.800
 I'm not sure.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:16.920
 I think the first two are good.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.440
 I don't quite understand that last one.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:22.280
 I think actually maybe the word piss is quite onomatopoeic.

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.160
 Oh, yeah.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.040
 It's quite fluid, isn't it?

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.160
 You're right, yes.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.160
 Do you know the word bum is onomatopoeic?

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.680
 You mean our word, bum, that word itself.

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:33.080
 Oh, because it looks like a, the B on the M.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.200
 That's not real.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.280
 Onomatopoeic means it makes the noise.

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:37.320
 Yes.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.840
 So it's like a fat noise, basically.

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.480
 Interesting.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.840
 That's called the OED, anyway.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.320
 What's it called then, what I've just mentioned,

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.400
 when a word looks like the object?

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.240
 I don't know if there's a word for that.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.480
 I think it's called being made up.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.960
 Bed looks a bit like a bed,

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.960
 because you've got the two posts at either end,

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.520
 and then you've got the curly mattress going all the way along.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:04.120
 And famously, Dan said that the word golf looks like

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.440
 someone playing golf, because the O is the ball,

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.480
 and the L is the club, and the F is the flag.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.160
 The word string looks like a long piece of string,

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.920
 if you laid it out in the shape of the word string.

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:20.040
 We need a word for this.

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.960
 Susie Dent, if there isn't one, make it up.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:26.360
 They have strong links with the UK, actually, the Basque people,

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.800
 because there used to be ships

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.040
 which would import English coal to the Basque region,

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.800
 and then the sons of the Basque bourgeoisie

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.720
 would go to England to be educated.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.760
 And that, James, is it true that there is a club

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:38.280
 called Athletic Club Bilbao?

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:44.280
 Oh, yeah, one of the biggest football teams in Spain.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:44.760
 There we go.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.880
 I think that team is because of that link with the UK,

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:51.240
 with England, which had obviously where football was being developed.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:51.560
 Right.

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:53.160
 I think it's Athletic Bilbao.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.280
 It's one of them down there,

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:58.200
 where they only have Basque footballers who play for them,

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.520
 certainly until very recently,

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:05.160
 that you had to live within or be born within 10 miles of the ground,

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.840
 otherwise you couldn't play for them.

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:07.720
 Pretty sure that's right.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.000
 Nice.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.320
 We used to get a lot of Basque iron from there,

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:16.200
 and they had the best iron in the world in the Basque country.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:21.160
 In Hamlet, there is a line which is the mutinies in the Bilboes,

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.400
 and they're referring to the shackles,

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.880
 the Bilboes are the shackles that prisoners are using

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:26.760
 when they're in a boat.

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:31.080
 And that word Bilboe comes from the city of Bilbao,

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.960
 which is one of the biggest cities in the Basque region.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:37.800
 And actually, it also is where Bilbao Baggins gets his name.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.040
 Yeah, get out.

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.480
 Yeah, named after Bilbao,

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.840
 because I think that Tolkien got it from Shakespeare,

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.840
 but Shakespeare got it from the city.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:46.920
 Right.

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:47.720
 That's terrific.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.480
 Bilbao Baggins.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:53.080
 He's a bit cooler, isn't he?

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:53.720
 Yeah.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:54.680
 Bilbao Baggins.

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:56.440
 He's staying up late.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.600
 He's having some delicious pintos.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.040
 He's got a sexy Spanish accent.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:01.560
 I like him better.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:05.880
 Can I just tell you one more thing about a Canadian lake?

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:10.120
 There is a lake with an island in it,

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:12.680
 and the island in the lake is bigger than the lake.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:16.200
 Okay, sorry.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:19.000
 Mannequaguan Reservoir.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.040
 It's in Quebec.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.200
 Just how can that be?

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.840
 So it's a ring, quite a ring around.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.040
 It's a ring around.

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:26.600
 Basically.

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.640
 It's an annular lake.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:31.880
 So basically it was created by a meteorite,

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:33.640
 and then there was an upswell of land.

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:37.800
 So it's like a circular island and then a circular lake,

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.680
 but the lake is only just wider than the island,

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.920
 so the water is just the ring around it,

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:43.960
 if that makes sense.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:44.680
 Very cool.

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:46.360
 It's like a kids' water park.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.560
 Like a kids' water park.

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.320
 But how is the island bigger than the...

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:53.160
 Because the area of the lake is only the bit where the water is,

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.640
 which just goes around in the bend of water.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:56.760
 Okay, okay.

00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.840
 I thought you were saying that the island had grown

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:02.040
 like a mushroom and expanded beyond the lake.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.120
 Well, the other thing is that...

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.400
 No, I didn't say that.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.880
 But the other thing is that there's like a little mountain on it,

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:11.080
 so the surface area of the island would be more as well,

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.320
 because it goes upwards as well as flowers.

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:13.960
 That's very cool.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.640
 Anyway, that's nice to think.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.480
 That's where the water slide would go,

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:20.600
 top of the mountain, slide into the circular...

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.160
 The rubber ring.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.200
 The Lazy River.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.480
 The Lazy River, thank you.

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:27.560
 Baseball players also love sunflower seeds, apparently,

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:32.360
 in the USA, to such an extent that Major League Baseball

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:35.480
 had to ban sunflower seed eating during 2020.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:35.720
 Why?

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.560
 Covid.

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:37.960
 Covid.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:43.800
 That's the answer to any question where the word 2020 is in there.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:48.600
 James, next time I'd appreciate a bit more hamming and hoeing.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.600
 The littler!

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.480
 Was it something to do with the first six weeks of 2020?

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:59.720
 It was because players were spitting.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.560
 When they chew, then they spit,

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:02.680
 and that was cracked down on,

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:05.480
 and they said, "We can't trust you to eat sunflower seeds and not spit."

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:09.080
 They also banned after-game showers, I presume, for the same reason.

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:10.600
 Because they spit in them?

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.120
 No, I don't, sorry.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.440
 Too COVID-y, I guess.

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:14.920
 Too COVID-y.

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:15.560
 Too sexy.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.000
 Too sexy.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.520
 I don't think that was the worry, was it?

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.720
 A communal after-game showers?

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.720
 I think you were allowed to have a shower by yourself.

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:24.360
 I don't know.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.360
 It wasn't too sexy.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:29.160
 It wasn't like they couldn't help snogging each other as soon as they go in.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.960
 I don't know what you think happens after a sporting event.

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:35.080
 I have never been close enough to a sporting event to find out.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:38.200
 Is that as soon as the finder whistle goes, everyone's kicked off.

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.960
 I'm making it up.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:40.360
 So far, everyone.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:46.040
 Dylan Thomas and his wife, Caitlyn,

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:49.160
 they're an open relationship, so they were sleeping left, right and centre.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:50.520
 They're three kids together and Caitlyn...

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:51.480
 With other people, right?

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:51.800
 Yeah.

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:52.920
 They were just sleeping, right?

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:56.200
 I quite like the idea of an open relationship,

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.880
 if it means you get to sleep a lot.

00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:58.600
 Absolutely.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.480
 That sounds lovely.

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:02.200
 Yeah, going around with a mattress strapped to your back.

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.800
 This is just for naps.

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.560
 Was it definitely open?

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:09.080
 I thought they always got pissed off with each other when the other one had affairs.

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:10.680
 I think he did a lot of womanising.

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:11.480
 He did shed loads of womanising.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:12.680
 I don't know how much she did.

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:13.400
 She did a bunch.

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:17.400
 She said it was a miracle that her three kids were the children of Dylan,

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.320
 because it was touch and go.

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:21.160
 But I think it wasn't an open relationship.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.520
 If you're only touching and going,

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:24.200
 it's not going to be the other guy's kids.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.360
 Sounded out how it works, that's what Finn said too.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:26.760
 Okay.

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.480
 But do you remember those TV shows that used to be on,

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.960
 where you'd call up in the middle of the night,

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.320
 and it would be a competition,

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.320
 you entered and you'd win a car or something?

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.600
 Well, you'd never win.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.960
 Well, so there was one where there was this old man on the phone,

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:43.400
 he got through and it was always really easy quiz questions.

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:44.440
 And the question was like,

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.600
 "You'll win a car if you answer this,

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:50.680
 just tell me one word that starts with the word under."

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:53.800
 And this old man went, "Under milk would."

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:58.760
 And he didn't win the car because it's not a word.

00:16:58.760 --> 00:16:59.560
 No.

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:00.600
 It's not a word.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:01.800
 All right, it's under pressure.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.120
 Also not a word.

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:04.440
 What?

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.760
 Cool.

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:07.320
 Number three.

00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:14.280
 Singaporeans long hair, a famous band.

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:17.400
 Back when long hair was a symbol of resistance to the man.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:17.640
 Hippies.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:18.280
 What year?

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:18.280
 Hippies.

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.520
 Yeah, so do you know when that, roughly when it stopped?

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:22.200
 Yeah, when it stopped.

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.720
 I think it would have stopped in the early 80s.

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:24.040
 Okay.

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:26.760
 It happened, it stopped in the late 80s.

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:27.480
 Was it late 80s?

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.400
 Around the time of the war on piss.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.440
 Oh yeah.

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.480
 Maybe once they entered the band,

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:35.800
 they thought we freed up our judicial resources to wage war on left-wing.

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:39.320
 Yeah, there was a Japanese guy called Kitaro,

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:43.160
 who was forced to cancel a gig in 1984 because of his long hair.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:43.880
 Was he?

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:46.840
 And the BG's famously had to, they were given,

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:49.400
 you could sometimes get a pass, a long hair pass.

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:51.080
 And I think one year they came to do a gig,

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:52.600
 and they got 48 hour pass.

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:54.520
 Because basically they didn't want Singapore in,

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:56.280
 Singapore didn't want its own people.

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.160
 It just seems like after 46 hours,

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.840
 someone's chasing you with some clippers.

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:02.920
 Looks like Cinderella.

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:08.840
 They're running, they're running to the gates of the airport.

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:10.680
 The wonderful airport.

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.320
 Followed by the citizen man.

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.960
 What was the result of them if they got busted?

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.160
 Like, how bad is the...

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.560
 It does, I think you've got a large final,

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:20.760
 you've got a forced to cut off your hair.

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.840
 Oh okay, not death sentence.

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:23.720
 They're just running away.

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:26.120
 Not staying alive.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:27.640
 Not staying alive, indeed.

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:30.920
 Yeah, I don't think death sentence for the BG's was there really.

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:34.360
 But then the next year, they weren't given a pass.

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.440
 So I think it might have all been a ploy this lot

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:39.480
 to stop the BG's coming back after they didn't like them the first time.

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:43.800
 There was, if you ever needed the government for anything,

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:48.440
 so let's say you needed to get some social security,

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:52.200
 or you needed someone to help you with some building permit

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.720
 or something, there would be signs that said

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.200
 "Males with long hair will be attended to last."

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:58.760
 So you just go to the back of the queue.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.160
 Ouch, interesting.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:04.200
 And long hair, the definition is quite stringent.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.800
 All the Beatles would have failed.

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:09.080
 It's like long hair is the definition is if it covers your ears,

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.000
 or if it touches your eyebrows.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:11.640
 Interesting.

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.200
 So Dan, I think if you didn't juice up your hair,

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.640
 or whatever it is you do with that front bit.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:16.440
 I'd juice it up, yeah.

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:19.800
 I think that might have stretched your eyebrows.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:23.960
 I wonder if that would trick them though,

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:26.120
 if you could, if you did juice it up into a quiff

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:27.240
 as you went through security.

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:27.880
 Yeah, I don't think so.

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:28.920
 I think they see through that.

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:29.640
 They probably see through.

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:30.840
 Or maybe a cool horn.

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:32.440
 Yeah, yeah, I mean it is.

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:33.560
 And you didn't go on.

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:34.280
 How interesting.

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:37.320
 You know, if you were in a public toilet in Singapore,

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:38.840
 you were legally required to flush.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:40.200
 Really?

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:40.680
 Okay, yes.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.760
 Like still to this day.

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:43.400
 I believe so.

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:44.040
 Yeah, right.

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:45.480
 It is, it is in the rule.

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:50.040
 The, I saw that and the fine from first fence is up to a thousand pounds.

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:56.760
 But there is a further thing that says that it is $5,000 for every day

00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:01.000
 or part thereof during which the offense continues after conviction.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.600
 So in theory, if you go for a wee and you don't flush,

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:08.360
 and then no one else uses that toilet for like three weeks,

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:11.720
 you'd have to pay $500 for each time in theory.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:14.840
 Do they, do they rope it off and say you have to,

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:17.080
 you have to be the one to go back and do it?

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:21.640
 In actual fact, that bit of the law is due to another part of the,

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:23.480
 it's a public sanitation law.

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.880
 And that part is referring really to something else.

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:29.480
 It's like, you know, people digging up pipes when they shouldn't be.

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.960
 But technically, like according to the law,

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:34.840
 if you don't flush and no one flushes it for a year,

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:38.120
 you'd have to pay $180,000.

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:42.760
 And are there exemptions if it's the middle of the night

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:43.880
 and you didn't want to wake anyone up?

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:46.040
 I think that's fine.

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:50.280
 Did you hear about the experimental lakes area in Canada?

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:50.920
 I love this.

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:51.480
 No.

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:52.760
 Canada has so many lakes.

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:57.640
 They have set aside 58 in Ontario alone, specifically for scientific research.

00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:01.480
 And they've spent 50 years studying these 58 lakes.

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:05.320
 And it's like a, it's like a scientific playground basically.

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:09.560
 So they study acid rain and they study algae blooms.

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:14.040
 And they, in 2018, they spilled 90 gallons of oil

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.640
 into one of the lakes on purpose.

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.400
 Because when you have an oil spill,

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:19.640
 normally people just rush there with like cotton buds

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:22.280
 and try and clean up the birds and clean up the oil and all of that.

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.440
 They were trying to work out how it moves,

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.840
 how do you deal with it, that kind of thing.

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:29.480
 Maybe it just sorts itself out.

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:31.160
 Maybe it just sorts itself out and that's what they found,

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:33.320
 that we've been wasting our time cleaning it up.

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:35.240
 Or estrogen going into the water,

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:38.600
 like synthetic estrogen in sort of medicines and things like that.

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:40.440
 What does that do to fish?

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:40.760
 Yes.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:43.560
 Because it changes the sex of loads of fish and all of this.

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:45.640
 So they're like crash test dummy lakes

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:48.760
 that have massively improved water quality across the whole planet.

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:49.160
 Interesting.

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:52.840
 Because the results can be found and spread across the world.

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:53.480
 It's really cool.

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:54.120
 Nice.

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.840
 Well, there's also this lake which is super scientifically important

00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:01.000
 because it seems to represent how humans have messed up the world.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:07.080
 This is also in Canada and this is called Crawford Lake.

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:09.480
 It's 24 meters deep but it's quite small.

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:11.240
 And this is when, you know, there's this big debate

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.480
 about whether we're in the Anthropocene era yet.

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:17.160
 And so we, the Holocene has been in a few thousand years

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.640
 and then the Anthropocene is defined as the epoch

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:22.680
 where humans are having the biggest effect on the environment.

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:24.920
 And every new era, I didn't know this,

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:28.520
 every new era has to have a location, a place that represents it.

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:32.280
 And it was decided this tiny little lake in Ontario, Crawford Lake,

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:36.040
 represented it because it's so deep, it's so small,

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:39.000
 that the bottom waters don't mix with the top waters.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.440
 So all the sediment that's been laid down on it over the years

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:43.560
 doesn't get messed around.

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:45.400
 So if you take a big bit of segment,

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.480
 a big cross section of sediment and look on it,

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:49.320
 you can see the mark of humans.

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:52.040
 So the first nuclear test immediately appears

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:53.480
 in your study of the sediment.

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:55.640
 When fossil fuels started to be increased in use,

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.640
 that immediately appears in the sediment.

00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:01.640
 So there's a big thing, is Crawford Lake the start of the new epoch?

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:02.840
 And they've decided that, no, it's not.

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:04.840
 Right, okay.

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:06.920
 So they've decided we're not in the Anthropocene yet.

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:08.120
 We're not in the Anthropocene yet.

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:10.520
 If we were, it would be Crawford Lake, but apparently we're not.

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:12.280
 I feel like if they went for another lake

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:13.960
 that wasn't in the middle of nowhere,

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.600
 they might have worked out that actually we are in it.

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:18.360
 Well, we would have got more press at least.

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:22.040
 Yeah, if they had gone to the Aral Sea or something.

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:23.720
 Yeah, yeah.

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:24.760
 Yes.

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:27.080
 Or somewhere where, you know, it's all dried up

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:29.320
 or there's just radiation there or something.

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:32.120
 They're really strict about the definition of a new epoch.

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.720
 Yeah, yes.

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:35.480
 Yeah, it's a big deal, isn't it?

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.720
 Exactly, you can't just go naming them Willy Nilly.

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:38.840
 It does feel like we're there though.

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:43.080
 Um, oh, one of us, one of us around this table

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:45.000
 will have had it more.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:45.880
 Golfers.

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:47.960
 I'm afraid not, James, let's sit back down.

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:52.840
 Will have had more, sorry, they experienced Paridolium.

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.680
 Will have experienced more Paridolia.

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:56.680
 And can we guess it based on knowledge of each other?

00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:56.920
 Absolutely.

00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:59.800
 It's got to be, I bet, golfers, idiots, or women.

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:03.400
 Don't feel like that.

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.880
 Um, maybe, maybe.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:06.840
 James has ruled out.

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:07.720
 Oh, okay.

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:11.400
 Will James have it less because of his Affentasia thing?

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:12.280
 Face blindness.

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:14.360
 I don't know whether that means James has it less.

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:17.000
 I mean, he's all the devil in that Picora one time.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.600
 So I think he's got it.

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:19.480
 Okay.

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:21.480
 I'll try and find the picture of that Picora

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:22.440
 and put it on my Instagram.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.560
 Please do.

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:25.080
 Is it me because I wear glasses

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:27.240
 and the lenses might give me little,

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:29.640
 little different glamourizing?

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:30.280
 No, it's not.

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:32.680
 So let's, can we please wrap this up?

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:33.400
 Yes, all right.

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:34.440
 It's got to be women.

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:35.400
 I have two guesses.

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:36.040
 It's not just women.

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:37.720
 Is it people who eat sushi on the train?

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:41.640
 You normally see the back of people's heads

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:44.280
 as they walk away along the carriage from you.

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:46.840
 No, it's mums.

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.080
 It's mums.

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:51.960
 It's, it's, this is a study in a biology letter.

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:55.640
 Scientists showed 380 women, a collection of images,

00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:57.720
 and the women who had given birth in the last year

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.120
 were likely to see faces

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:03.320
 and to perceive more face-like images in what they saw.

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:06.840
 And that might be due to more oxytocin.

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:09.080
 We don't know, but it might be sort of like

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:10.280
 the primitive nurturing instinct.

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:11.560
 They always say it's oxytocin, don't they?

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:13.400
 It's like, oh, my feet hurt.

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.600
 Yeah, it's oxytocin.

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:15.720
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.000
 But babies have it too.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.160
 So babies will spend longer looking at collections

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:20.680
 of dots and dashes that look a bit like a face

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:21.960
 than random dots and dashes,

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:23.800
 even after a few minutes of life.

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:26.040
 So it's a really deep program thing,

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:27.160
 this face-finding software.

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:29.400
 In fact, even before life,

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.760
 depending on when you think life starts,

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:33.240
 abortions can't make this piece so much easier.

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.640
 I don't want the inbox.

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:37.720
 We have, the inbox is a busy place, Hannah.

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:38.840
 I'm so sorry.

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:39.080
 Yep.

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:42.360
 Even before they're born, babies have it,

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:43.400
 which I find extraordinary,

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.840
 because they've never seen a face,

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.080
 but they did an experiment a few years ago,

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:51.480
 where they shone a triangle of three lights,

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:53.960
 three lit dots, a woman's uterus, basically,

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:54.520
 through her skin,

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:57.240
 and they monitored what the fetus was doing inside.

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:59.400
 And if the triangle has the two dots on the top

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:00.760
 and the one dot on the bottom,

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:02.360
 then the fetus would move around

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:04.840
 and crane its head towards it to look at it.

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:06.840
 But if it had the two dots on the bottom

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:08.120
 and the one dot at the top,

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:09.880
 so oriented not like a face,

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.240
 the fetus wouldn't care.

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:11.720
 Wow.

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:14.040
 And it's never seen a face.

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.000
 That's, yeah.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.040
 What's going on there?

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:17.480
 Unless it's got a mirror in there.

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.640
 What is going on there?

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:21.240
 Do they have to put it upside down,

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:23.160
 because babies are sometimes upside down in the womb?

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:24.360
 That's a really good point they must have,

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:25.000
 wasn't they?

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:25.560
 Yeah.

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:27.640
 Otherwise, the experiment is a complete wash.

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:28.440
 Oh, my God, Andy.

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:29.640
 You should write to them and check.

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:35.160
 A lot of people seem to leave bomb threats on sick bags,

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:38.840
 which seems quite an annoying thing to do.

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:42.440
 Over the years, there are constant articles of...

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:46.600
 Someone is misspelled, so I think in 2017,

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:49.560
 there's a fight from Sydney that had to be completely evacuated,

00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:52.840
 because a bag said B-O-M, which doesn't...

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:54.840
 I don't know if you just seem they even meant bomb.

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:55.800
 There was another one that was found...

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:55.960
 Wait a minute.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.960
 Was that not the one where they were going to Bombay?

00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:01.400
 I'm sure there was one that that happened once.

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:01.880
 Really?

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:02.200
 Yeah, yeah.

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:05.560
 They wrote sort of like, M-A-N to B-O-M,

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:07.480
 because it was Manchester to Mumbai,

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:09.560
 and they saw the bomb and they thought it was a bomb.

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:10.600
 That's really funny.

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:11.800
 I think these guys were going to

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:14.600
 not Bombay, but I can't imagine that would have happened.

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:15.240
 Can I check?

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:19.000
 Is this people who are getting off a plane

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.240
 and are playing a kind of sick prank as they leave?

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:23.560
 They just write the word bomb on the sick bag and then they get off?

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:24.520
 We think so, yes.

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:26.360
 Which I thought the cleaners did a better job than that.

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:29.000
 But yes, it is, because there was another one that was found

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.760
 just after a flight had taken off from Sydney in 2004,

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:35.800
 and someone found a sick bag in the toilet that said, "Bob."

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:39.400
 Which I just think is someone naming their bag.

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.720
 Well, yeah, it's two dyslexic people,

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:44.360
 because both are spelled bomb wrong in both case, right?

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:45.000
 Well, yeah.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.240
 One's missing the M and the other's missing the...

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:48.040
 Yeah, I mean, yes.

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:50.520
 But I mean, it could be that they weren't even trying to spell "Bob."

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:52.440
 In fact, so the plane had to turn around,

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.640
 had to be completely evacuated and landed back.

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:54.920
 Because they wrote "Bob" on a bag!

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:56.600
 Because they wrote "Bob" on a bag!

00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:58.760
 I don't know.

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:01.160
 I know, it does seem over-cautious, doesn't it?

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:02.920
 And the stewards and stewardesses said afterwards

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.600
 that actually, apparently,

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:07.160
 they commonly use the letters B-O-B anyway,

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:09.160
 a slang for best on board,

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:11.400
 meaning "fitty" in Isle Sever.

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.280
 Oh!

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:14.840
 So actually, it could have just been a stewardess, right?

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:16.760
 People are always calling me "Bob" on the planes.

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:18.920
 Yeah, that's why.

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:20.680
 That's why I'm the fittest one on the plane.

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:20.840
 Yeah.

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:22.360
 But you also charter your own flights everywhere

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:23.320
 and you're the only passenger.

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:26.120
 These are the helicopter flights with your wife,

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:26.840
 or it's just you two.

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:32.040
 Do you know, there's a really cool thing that you can see online

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:33.480
 called lightningmap.org,

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:36.040
 and it shows you where basically every lightning strike

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:37.800
 is happening live on our planet right now.

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:39.240
 Where's our closest lightning star?

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:41.960
 Dan's actually got the app open right now.

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:43.160
 The closest to us.

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:43.800
 Yeah, yeah.

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.800
 Let me make my way back to...

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:46.520
 No, no.

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:48.360
 If Panama's there, we're in the other direction.

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:48.760
 Yeah, yeah.

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:49.240
 I was...

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:50.360
 Dan's going the longer way.

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:51.800
 I was going, I was going, yeah.

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:57.000
 Don't police.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.120
 The route Dan thinks it's best to get from Panama to the UK.

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:00.840
 Yeah, man.

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:02.760
 Well, you're going to fall off the end-of-flat-earth dream.

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:04.280
 Ooh, it goes right round, mate.

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:05.400
 Now, that's South Africa.

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:06.920
 I'm trying because I'm trying to bring...

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:07.960
 I'm trying to do this...

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:09.320
 The pinchy thing to get it in.

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:10.520
 Come on.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:14.520
 Oh, Columbus missed out not having you on board, mate.

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:17.000
 All right, here we go.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:17.800
 Okay, we got it, we got it.

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:18.520
 Here we go.

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:20.440
 Okay.

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:22.360
 This absolutely captivating audio.

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:25.320
 I can see some in...

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:27.880
 It's all in a different language.

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:30.040
 That's in Albania.

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:31.400
 Oh, nice.

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:31.960
 All right, look at...

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:33.880
 If you're listening in Albania to us live,

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:37.080
 as this is going out, then watch out.

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:38.120
 A South of Tirana.

00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:39.320
 Oh, really?

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:41.000
 So if you're in the North, you're cool.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:41.560
 Okay.

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:43.640
 Apparently, we get 40 strikes every second,

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:48.520
 so more than 3 million lightning strikes per day on Earth,

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:49.800
 which is a lot.

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:52.600
 The worst sick bag of all time.

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:56.680
 This is, according to expert Danny Cahalan from Sydney.

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:58.200
 He's another baggist, I believe.

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.600
 He said the worst ever design was the 1970s.

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:01.640
 It's called the sick sack.

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:04.520
 And the problem is it's in an envelope itself,

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:06.840
 which makes it quite fiddly.

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:09.000
 Like, you're fiddling, you're getting a bag out of an envelope,

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:09.480
 you're opening...

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:12.760
 You know, it's often a quite old-time pressurized situation

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:13.960
 if you're throwing up on a flight.

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:15.240
 Yeah, you don't want to be opening.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:16.920
 You don't want to have to get your letter opener out, do you?

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:21.800
 In 1928, they tried anti-air-sickness fumes

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:23.000
 throughout aeroplanes.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:23.480
 Interesting.

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:23.640
 Really?

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:27.400
 And that was a mixture of oxygen and cinnamon smell.

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:28.200
 Oh, lovely.

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.720
 And hopefully not tonka bean.

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:32.360
 But they would send it through the plane,

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:35.160
 and the idea was it would stop people from feeling sick.

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:35.640
 Really?

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:36.920
 Did it work?

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:39.080
 Well, we don't have it today, do we?

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:40.280
 I don't think so, really.

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:41.480
 I think, really, in those days,

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:43.160
 people didn't really know what caused it.

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:47.000
 There was an article by a sum fund called the Guggenheim Fund

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.160
 who claimed that it was a psychological state.

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:52.120
 So, as in, it was just all in your head,

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:55.640
 and it could be cured by an increase in confidence in flyers.

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:58.760
 Maybe, I think I sort of buy that.

00:30:58.760 --> 00:30:59.240
 Do you?

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:00.840
 No, trouble sickness is real.

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:02.520
 Definitely it is.

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:03.720
 But I just think if I'm nervous,

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:05.720
 I'm likely to throw up on any given day.

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:06.840
 That's fair enough.

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:08.680
 That's why you vomit before the forecast every second.

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:09.400
 Every week.

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:11.800
 Grandmaster Flash collects mugs.

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:13.160
 No way.

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:13.480
 Yeah?

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.800
 He's got 5,000, he says, in a special room.

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:17.800
 And he says, "The room temperature is correct."

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:18.840
 What?

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:21.640
 Just room temperature, isn't it?

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:27.320
 Mugs don't have an incredibly narrow range of temperatures

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:28.280
 they can perform in.

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:32.200
 The whole point of a mug is that they can go to 100 degrees.

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:38.040
 But at least we know it's not like minus 200 degrees

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:39.560
 or plus 5,000 degrees.

00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:42.040
 He keeps it very carefully between minus 200

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:44.120
 and plus 5,000 degrees in that room.

00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:47.720
 His room salesman absolutely saw him coming.

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:58.280
 Okay, that's it.

00:31:58.280 --> 00:31:59.960
 That is all of our outtakes.

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:01.240
 Thanks, everyone.

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:03.400
 If you want to write into us about anything

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:06.680
 that we've said during the course of this compilation,

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:08.600
 why not drop us a line?

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.480
 Send an email to podcast@qi.com.

00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:14.520
 Andy will read these emails and he likes to cherry pick

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:17.800
 the best of them and bring them to our mailbag episode

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:19.480
 that we do as part of Clubfish.

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:21.880
 So that will be out in the next couple of weeks.

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:24.840
 Otherwise, head to the main episode this Friday

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:28.200
 to find out more details about our upcoming live shows.

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:29.640
 And we'll see you in a couple of weeks.

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:31.640
 All right, Clubfishers, catch you soon.

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:32.280
 Goodbye.

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:34.940
 (upbeat music)

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:38.400
 (upbeat music)

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:40.980
 (upbeat music)
