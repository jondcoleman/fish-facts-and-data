1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,200
 Hey, Club Fish members, it is Dan here.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,000
 Welcome to your bonus compilation episode.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,120
 This is all of the outtakes, all of the bloopers,

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,760
 the tangents, basically all the bits

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,760
 that didn't fit into the main narrative of the episodes,

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,400
 but stuff that we didn't wanna get rid of,

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,740
 and so we've brought it all together

9
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,020
 here in one handy compilation.

10
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,200
 But before we get into it,

11
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,320
 I just wanna remind anyone who hasn't seen the news,

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,280
 we're doing a couple of live shows very soon.

13
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,200
 We are gonna be playing the London Podcast Festival,

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,880
 and the fun thing about this is usually it's just a gig,

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,080
 and I believe the two gigs are actually sold out,

16
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,400
 if you wanna be there physically.

17
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,520
 However, we're gonna be live streaming the gigs.

18
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,360
 Now in the past, I know this has been really fun,

19
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,440
 because as you're watching the live stream,

20
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,160
 you can actually comment underneath

21
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,520
 as the show's going along.

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,280
 It's a really cool way of meeting fellow fish listeners,

23
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,760
 if you've not done that before.

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,680
 So why not check it out?

25
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,040
 The link is on our website.

26
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,600
 We're doing the fifth and sixth of September.

27
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,560
 We've partially announced the guest,

28
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,240
 who's gonna be joining us on the sixth,

29
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,760
 and that is Richard Osman.

30
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,200
 So that's gonna be really awesome.

31
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,360
 We'll be announcing our other guest very soon for the fifth,

32
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,080
 but as I say, tickets are available.

33
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,880
 You can watch it as it's happening live on stage.

34
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,360
 So we've also got another live show announcement coming up.

35
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,200
 We'll be announcing it at the top of this week's show,

36
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,480
 so keep a listen out for that,

37
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,200
 in case it happens to be in a town near you.

38
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,520
 And that's it for the admin.

39
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,560
 So let's get on with it.

40
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,880
 This is a big old chunky compilation episode.

41
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,880
 Here we go.

42
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:51,240
 Yeah, you mentioned Braveheart in this time,

43
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,640
 and the Battle of Sterling Bridge happened then.

44
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,880
 I like this from Wikipedia.

45
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,600
 The Battle of Sterling Bridge is depicted

46
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,720
 in the 1995 film Braveheart,

47
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,400
 but it bears little resemblance to the real battle.

48
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,040
 Most egregiously, there being no bridge.

49
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,160
 But that is the time when supposedly,

50
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,800
 the Scots lifted their kilts and showed their bums.

51
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,640
 - Interesting.

52
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,880
 - To scare the English,

53
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,720
 but we have no evidence that that happened.

54
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,800
 There's no contemporary evidence that happened,

55
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,360
 but we do have a 14th century account

56
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,120
 of the English doing that against the Scottish.

57
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,360
 - Really? - During those wars.

58
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,720
 - Dropping their trousers. - Yeah.

59
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,760
 - Really? - I don't know.

60
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,880
 - In the Chronicle of Peter Langtoft,

61
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,200
 they mentioned the English doing that.

62
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,600
 - No way. - I don't know.

63
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,360
 - And did it scare the Scots,

64
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,520
 or did it make them think, "Oh, open target?"

65
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,240
 - I think we haven't seen before, you know.

66
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,600
 - Yeah. - We've all got them, you know.

67
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,080
 (laughing)

68
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,640
 Why are they triangular?

69
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,640
 - High ends. - Yeah.

70
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,920
 You know how they've got the point at the front?

71
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,520
 - Yeah. - They shape like a boat, basically.

72
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,360
 - Yes, yeah, good question.

73
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,520
 - I think to carve a route through the clothes,

74
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,720
 much like a boat through the water.

75
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,280
 If they were shaped the opposite,

76
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,760
 it would be harder to do the ironing.

77
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,840
 - I think so. - I think so.

78
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,640
 - Why don't you try doing it backwards the next time?

79
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,040
 - That's a really good idea.

80
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,600
 That's a really good idea.

81
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,760
 - And why is the shape-- - Yeah, why is the shape

82
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,960
 - I'll end up with my shirt on, back to front.

83
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,040
 That's your nightmare.

84
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,880
 (laughing)

85
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,120
 - My pants on your head.

86
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,960
 (laughing)

87
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,920
 - Be frantically searching for the why.

88
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,080
 (laughing)

89
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,640
 - We used to have double pointed,

90
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,360
 back to front reversible ones,

91
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,400
 which would save you having the whole trousers

92
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,400
 on your head, pullover.

93
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,240
 - I see, like a sort of--

94
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,440
 - It looked like a leaf, I suppose.

95
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,480
 - Like a canoe.

96
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,520
 - Or a canoe, yes.

97
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,920
 - Keep the bolt analogy going.

98
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,440
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

99
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,640
 Which we should do throughout.

100
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,560
 And these were the most popular irons

101
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,600
 from about 1870 to the 1930s, '40s,

102
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,760
 when electric irons came in,

103
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,000
 and they were invented by this woman called Mary Potts.

104
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,080
 So she basically invented the iron

105
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,240
 that people were using in the late 19th, early 20th century.

106
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,120
 And she got lots of patterns for it.

107
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,960
 So she made it hollow, so it wasn't as heavy.

108
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,840
 And it also didn't get so dangerously hot,

109
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,880
 'cause she filled the inside with wool

110
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,400
 or something non-heat conducting,

111
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,440
 'cause people were constantly burning their hands.

112
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,980
 And she invented the removable handle.

113
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,720
 So you could constantly have,

114
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,240
 you could be heating up one iron

115
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,480
 while you were using the other,

116
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,680
 and then you could swap the iron onto the handle.

117
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,520
 - That's really clever.

118
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,280
 - Oh, wait, why can't they both just have a handle?

119
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,120
 Sorry, I've been really stupid.

120
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,360
 - 'Cause the handle would probably heat up, right?

121
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,960
 - Get super hot, yeah. - 'Cause the only way you can't,

122
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,080
 yeah, it's like when you cook an egg,

123
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,560
 sometimes that handle, you gotta let go.

124
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,040
 - I don't hold onto the pan

125
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,840
 all the way through the cooking process.

126
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,480
 - What? - You've got to grip

127
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,120
 the rim of the pan with both hands, ideally.

128
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,880
 - As the saying goes, a held part always biles.

129
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,440
 - John Harvey Kellogg.

130
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,840
 - Okay. - Oh.

131
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,920
 - Cornflakes pioneer and anti-fiddling around

132
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,520
 with yourself advocate.

133
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,440
 - Go back to early episodes

134
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,880
 to see what the hell that's referring to.

135
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,000
 - Yes. - We won't tell you

136
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,760
 which one, weighing through all 580.

137
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,080
 - I believe he invented an early sunbed.

138
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,360
 He believed it could cure almost everything.

139
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,000
 And there was a big thing of sun therapy,

140
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,480
 and high-altitude sunbathing in particular,

141
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,800
 'cause it gave you supposedly more unfiltered ultraviolet rays,

142
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,440
 which was especially good for you at the time,

143
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,120
 as we now know is not the case.

144
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,320
 - It's weird 'cause there were some truths

145
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,120
 to this idea at the time.

146
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,280
 I guess Kellogg thought that it filled your skin with blood,

147
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,160
 which drew blood away from your diseased organs,

148
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,240
 which wasn't correct.

149
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,960
 But the seventh did, in fact,

150
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,920
 install one of his sun baths in the palace in 1903,

151
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,640
 where you sat in a chair, which was fully enclosed,

152
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,480
 and it had 52 light bulbs around you

153
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,200
 that could glow any color for different health benefits.

154
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,440
 But at the same time that one of the first Nobel Prizes

155
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,440
 was awarded for discovering the benefits

156
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,280
 of light therapy on... - Tobaccoosis.

157
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,480
 - And TB, yeah, exactly. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

158
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,760
 - Which was basically true, Niels Finnsen.

159
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,680
 Yeah, and then they opened lots of Solaria,

160
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,160
 didn't they, all over Europe,

161
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,600
 which were basically for patients who were sick with stuff

162
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,000
 where you had these amazing sounding hospitals,

163
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,800
 which the NHS would never fund today,

164
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,320
 but where you could lie in this room

165
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,740
 and the entire roof would retract on a sunny day

166
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,520
 so you could be exposed to the sun.

167
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,600
 Or giant balconies where your whole big bed

168
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,840
 would be wheeled out onto them.

169
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,840
 And that was good for you.

170
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,520
 But I don't know about the Kellogg shit.

171
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,360
 - I don't know.

172
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,120
 - It doesn't cure gout and constipation like Kellogg claimed.

173
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,700
 (all laughing)

174
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:26,120
 - If you go to the beach and you get a suntan,

175
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,640
 then it's mostly due to the sun.

176
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,280
 - Thanks very much. - Carry on, Professor.

177
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,280
 - However, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1% of the radiation

178
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,160
 comes from stars beyond the galaxy.

179
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,920
 - Oh, that's great.

180
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,640
 - Because it's photons coming from, you know,

181
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,720
 from outer outer space that come onto our earth.

182
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,560
 And a certain amount of those photons will go into your body

183
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,560
 and they will cause your body to turn.

184
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,680
 - That's so cool.

185
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,720
 If you get a night suntan,

186
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,360
 and how, I suppose it would take too long.

187
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,840
 - I think it would take too long,

188
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,800
 given the number of zeros and that number.

189
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,440
 - So with that photon,

190
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,000
 that's traveled billions of miles across the universe,

191
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,240
 is that the end point?

192
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,640
 - Absorbs into your body.

193
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,520
 - You're the end point for this photon.

194
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,680
 - Pretty cool, that is pretty cool.

195
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,520
 - I mean, is that true?

196
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,360
 Is that what it would be?

197
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,560
 - Yeah, it would absolve into your body.

198
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,920
 - Wow, I read a thing as well that not only do we get

199
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,000
 that 0.0, 0.0, whatever it is,

200
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,640
 percentage of our suntan from the stars beyond our sun,

201
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,360
 but also from the leftover of the Big Bang.

202
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,640
 - Yeah, it's plausible.

203
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,640
 - Tan from the Big Bang, a Bangtan, cool.

204
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,200
 - That's pretty wild. - That's awesome.

205
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,360
 - Really good. - There was another one.

206
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,520
 This one definitely has some kind of meaning to it.

207
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,840
 So in Melanesian legend,

208
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,480
 they had two gods called Tagaro and Tsukumatua,

209
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,560
 and they shared the work of creation.

210
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,680
 But whenever Tagaro did something,

211
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,680
 he did it well, and Tsukumatua did it really badly.

212
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,960
 And so like, when they made trees,

213
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,080
 Tagaro made really nice food,

214
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,840
 and Tsukumatua's was really bitter, and stuff like that.

215
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,200
 Like Tsukumatua wanted to have men

216
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,160
 sleep in the trunks of Sego palms,

217
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,480
 but Tagaro thought, no, they should live in houses instead,

218
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,680
 and stuff like that.

219
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,840
 And when they created men,

220
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,880
 Tagaro said that humans should have anuses,

221
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,240
 but Tsukumatua said, no,

222
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,680
 they definitely shouldn't have anuses.

223
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,160
 And as a result, the ones that he made,

224
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,440
 swelled up and burst because they could not defecate.

225
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,440
 - And again, is the meaning, do the job properly?

226
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,080
 Do you work? - I think so.

227
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,840
 - Like, don't half-ass it, literally half-ass it.

228
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,920
 - It's like the yin, don't zero-ass it, yeah.

229
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,520
 It's like the yin and the yang, right?

230
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,680
 It's like you always have to have the,

231
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,160
 not good and evil in this case,

232
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,760
 but sort of good and not very good.

233
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,720
 - Right, right, right.

234
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,680
 And it's, yeah, yeah.

235
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,120
 I think we've just invented a new phrase.

236
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,840
 I think we can just say, you've no asked this.

237
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,800
 He's really no asked that project.

238
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,520
 I think that's good.

239
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,520
 - I think like the Basque language actually is quite good

240
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,560
 for onomatopoeic words.

241
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,960
 So words that sound like they're supposed to be.

242
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,960
 So, do you know what pill-pill?

243
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,360
 - Your medicine? - A pill, yeah, two pills.

244
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,200
 No, no, it's onomatopoeic.

245
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,680
 It's gonna sound like the big pill-pill.

246
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,040
 Pill-pill, a laser, a laser, a space laser in a film.

247
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,560
 Oh, that would be pew-pew.

248
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,040
 Oh, yes.

249
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,720
 It's the word for boiling liquid.

250
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,600
 Okay, nice, yeah, I see that.

251
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,400
 Terrain, pill-pill.

252
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:25,800
 Terrain.

253
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,720
 Say it again.

254
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,280
 Terrain.

255
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,400
 Terrain.

256
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:29,640
 Terrain.

257
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,320
 Terrain.

258
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,360
 Terrain, terrain.

259
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,840
 Terrain, terrain, terrain, terrain.

260
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,960
 It's the pink one, the theme tune.

261
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,520
 There we go.

262
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,560
 It's a word for bell-ringing.

263
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,040
 Okay, as in like, to ring, to ring.

264
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,360
 To ring, to ring, to ring, to ring, to ring, to ring, to ring.

265
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,680
 To ring, to ring, to ring, to ring, to ring.

266
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,360
 And what about this one?

267
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,320
 Cheez-ah.

268
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,200
 Cheez-ah, cheez-ah, cheez-ah.

269
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,320
 Cheez-ah, cheez-ah, cheez-ah.

270
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,920
 Cheez-ah, cheez-ah, cheez-ah.

271
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,760
 Yes, it's the word for Tom Jones.

272
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,560
 No. Did he sing that?

273
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,120
 I don't know.

274
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,240
 And it's the word for urinating.

275
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,560
 Cheez-ah, cheez-ah, cheez-ah, cheez-ah, cheez-ah, cheez-ah.

276
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,480
 It's like piss, piss-sink, I guess.

277
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,080
 Oh, not the sound that comes out,

278
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,320
 because I'd see a doctor if it's saying cheez-ah.

279
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,800
 I'm not sure.

280
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,920
 I think the first two are good.

281
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,440
 I don't quite understand that last one.

282
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,280
 I think actually maybe the word piss is quite onomatopoeic.

283
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,160
 Oh, yeah.

284
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,040
 It's quite fluid, isn't it?

285
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,160
 You're right, yes.

286
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,160
 Do you know the word bum is onomatopoeic?

287
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,680
 You mean our word, bum, that word itself.

288
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,080
 Oh, because it looks like a, the B on the M.

289
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,200
 That's not real.

290
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,280
 Onomatopoeic means it makes the noise.

291
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,320
 Yes.

292
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,840
 So it's like a fat noise, basically.

293
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,480
 Interesting.

294
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,840
 That's called the OED, anyway.

295
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,320
 What's it called then, what I've just mentioned,

296
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,400
 when a word looks like the object?

297
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,240
 I don't know if there's a word for that.

298
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,480
 I think it's called being made up.

299
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,960
 Bed looks a bit like a bed,

300
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,960
 because you've got the two posts at either end,

301
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,520
 and then you've got the curly mattress going all the way along.

302
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:04,120
 And famously, Dan said that the word golf looks like

303
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,440
 someone playing golf, because the O is the ball,

304
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,480
 and the L is the club, and the F is the flag.

305
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,160
 The word string looks like a long piece of string,

306
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,920
 if you laid it out in the shape of the word string.

307
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:20,040
 We need a word for this.

308
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,960
 Susie Dent, if there isn't one, make it up.

309
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:26,360
 They have strong links with the UK, actually, the Basque people,

310
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,800
 because there used to be ships

311
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,040
 which would import English coal to the Basque region,

312
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,800
 and then the sons of the Basque bourgeoisie

313
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,720
 would go to England to be educated.

314
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,760
 And that, James, is it true that there is a club

315
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,280
 called Athletic Club Bilbao?

316
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:44,280
 Oh, yeah, one of the biggest football teams in Spain.

317
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:44,760
 There we go.

318
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,880
 I think that team is because of that link with the UK,

319
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,240
 with England, which had obviously where football was being developed.

320
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:51,560
 Right.

321
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,160
 I think it's Athletic Bilbao.

322
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,280
 It's one of them down there,

323
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,200
 where they only have Basque footballers who play for them,

324
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,520
 certainly until very recently,

325
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:05,160
 that you had to live within or be born within 10 miles of the ground,

326
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,840
 otherwise you couldn't play for them.

327
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,720
 Pretty sure that's right.

328
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,000
 Nice.

329
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,320
 We used to get a lot of Basque iron from there,

330
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:16,200
 and they had the best iron in the world in the Basque country.

331
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:21,160
 In Hamlet, there is a line which is the mutinies in the Bilboes,

332
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,400
 and they're referring to the shackles,

333
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,880
 the Bilboes are the shackles that prisoners are using

334
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,760
 when they're in a boat.

335
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,080
 And that word Bilboe comes from the city of Bilbao,

336
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,960
 which is one of the biggest cities in the Basque region.

337
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,800
 And actually, it also is where Bilbao Baggins gets his name.

338
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,040
 Yeah, get out.

339
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,480
 Yeah, named after Bilbao,

340
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,840
 because I think that Tolkien got it from Shakespeare,

341
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,840
 but Shakespeare got it from the city.

342
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:46,920
 Right.

343
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,720
 That's terrific.

344
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,480
 Bilbao Baggins.

345
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,080
 He's a bit cooler, isn't he?

346
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,720
 Yeah.

347
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,680
 Bilbao Baggins.

348
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,440
 He's staying up late.

349
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,600
 He's having some delicious pintos.

350
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,040
 He's got a sexy Spanish accent.

351
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,560
 I like him better.

352
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,880
 Can I just tell you one more thing about a Canadian lake?

353
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,120
 There is a lake with an island in it,

354
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,680
 and the island in the lake is bigger than the lake.

355
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,200
 Okay, sorry.

356
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,000
 Mannequaguan Reservoir.

357
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,040
 It's in Quebec.

358
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,200
 Just how can that be?

359
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,840
 So it's a ring, quite a ring around.

360
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,040
 It's a ring around.

361
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,600
 Basically.

362
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,640
 It's an annular lake.

363
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,880
 So basically it was created by a meteorite,

364
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,640
 and then there was an upswell of land.

365
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,800
 So it's like a circular island and then a circular lake,

366
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,680
 but the lake is only just wider than the island,

367
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,920
 so the water is just the ring around it,

368
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,960
 if that makes sense.

369
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,680
 Very cool.

370
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,360
 It's like a kids' water park.

371
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,560
 Like a kids' water park.

372
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,320
 But how is the island bigger than the...

373
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,160
 Because the area of the lake is only the bit where the water is,

374
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,640
 which just goes around in the bend of water.

375
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,760
 Okay, okay.

376
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,840
 I thought you were saying that the island had grown

377
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,040
 like a mushroom and expanded beyond the lake.

378
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,120
 Well, the other thing is that...

379
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,400
 No, I didn't say that.

380
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,880
 But the other thing is that there's like a little mountain on it,

381
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,080
 so the surface area of the island would be more as well,

382
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,320
 because it goes upwards as well as flowers.

383
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:13,960
 That's very cool.

384
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,640
 Anyway, that's nice to think.

385
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,480
 That's where the water slide would go,

386
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,600
 top of the mountain, slide into the circular...

387
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,160
 The rubber ring.

388
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,200
 The Lazy River.

389
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,480
 The Lazy River, thank you.

390
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,560
 Baseball players also love sunflower seeds, apparently,

391
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:32,360
 in the USA, to such an extent that Major League Baseball

392
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,480
 had to ban sunflower seed eating during 2020.

393
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:35,720
 Why?

394
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,560
 Covid.

395
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:37,960
 Covid.

396
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:43,800
 That's the answer to any question where the word 2020 is in there.

397
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,600
 James, next time I'd appreciate a bit more hamming and hoeing.

398
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,600
 The littler!

399
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,480
 Was it something to do with the first six weeks of 2020?

400
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,720
 It was because players were spitting.

401
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,560
 When they chew, then they spit,

402
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,680
 and that was cracked down on,

403
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,480
 and they said, "We can't trust you to eat sunflower seeds and not spit."

404
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,080
 They also banned after-game showers, I presume, for the same reason.

405
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,600
 Because they spit in them?

406
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,120
 No, I don't, sorry.

407
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,440
 Too COVID-y, I guess.

408
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:14,920
 Too COVID-y.

409
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,560
 Too sexy.

410
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,000
 Too sexy.

411
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,520
 I don't think that was the worry, was it?

412
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,720
 A communal after-game showers?

413
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,720
 I think you were allowed to have a shower by yourself.

414
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,360
 I don't know.

415
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,360
 It wasn't too sexy.

416
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,160
 It wasn't like they couldn't help snogging each other as soon as they go in.

417
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,960
 I don't know what you think happens after a sporting event.

418
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,080
 I have never been close enough to a sporting event to find out.

419
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,200
 Is that as soon as the finder whistle goes, everyone's kicked off.

420
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,960
 I'm making it up.

421
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,360
 So far, everyone.

422
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:46,040
 Dylan Thomas and his wife, Caitlyn,

423
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,160
 they're an open relationship, so they were sleeping left, right and centre.

424
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,520
 They're three kids together and Caitlyn...

425
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,480
 With other people, right?

426
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:51,800
 Yeah.

427
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,920
 They were just sleeping, right?

428
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,200
 I quite like the idea of an open relationship,

429
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,880
 if it means you get to sleep a lot.

430
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,600
 Absolutely.

431
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,480
 That sounds lovely.

432
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,200
 Yeah, going around with a mattress strapped to your back.

433
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,800
 This is just for naps.

434
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,560
 Was it definitely open?

435
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,080
 I thought they always got pissed off with each other when the other one had affairs.

436
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,680
 I think he did a lot of womanising.

437
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,480
 He did shed loads of womanising.

438
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,680
 I don't know how much she did.

439
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,400
 She did a bunch.

440
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,400
 She said it was a miracle that her three kids were the children of Dylan,

441
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,320
 because it was touch and go.

442
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,160
 But I think it wasn't an open relationship.

443
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,520
 If you're only touching and going,

444
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,200
 it's not going to be the other guy's kids.

445
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,360
 Sounded out how it works, that's what Finn said too.

446
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:26,760
 Okay.

447
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,480
 But do you remember those TV shows that used to be on,

448
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,960
 where you'd call up in the middle of the night,

449
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,320
 and it would be a competition,

450
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,320
 you entered and you'd win a car or something?

451
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,600
 Well, you'd never win.

452
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,960
 Well, so there was one where there was this old man on the phone,

453
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,400
 he got through and it was always really easy quiz questions.

454
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,440
 And the question was like,

455
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,600
 "You'll win a car if you answer this,

456
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,680
 just tell me one word that starts with the word under."

457
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,800
 And this old man went, "Under milk would."

458
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:58,760
 And he didn't win the car because it's not a word.

459
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,560
 No.

460
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,600
 It's not a word.

461
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,800
 All right, it's under pressure.

462
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,120
 Also not a word.

463
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:04,440
 What?

464
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,760
 Cool.

465
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,320
 Number three.

466
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:14,280
 Singaporeans long hair, a famous band.

467
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,400
 Back when long hair was a symbol of resistance to the man.

468
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:17,640
 Hippies.

469
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,280
 What year?

470
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:18,280
 Hippies.

471
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,520
 Yeah, so do you know when that, roughly when it stopped?

472
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,200
 Yeah, when it stopped.

473
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,720
 I think it would have stopped in the early 80s.

474
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,040
 Okay.

475
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,760
 It happened, it stopped in the late 80s.

476
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,480
 Was it late 80s?

477
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,400
 Around the time of the war on piss.

478
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,440
 Oh yeah.

479
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,480
 Maybe once they entered the band,

480
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,800
 they thought we freed up our judicial resources to wage war on left-wing.

481
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,320
 Yeah, there was a Japanese guy called Kitaro,

482
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,160
 who was forced to cancel a gig in 1984 because of his long hair.

483
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:43,880
 Was he?

484
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,840
 And the BG's famously had to, they were given,

485
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,400
 you could sometimes get a pass, a long hair pass.

486
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,080
 And I think one year they came to do a gig,

487
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,600
 and they got 48 hour pass.

488
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,520
 Because basically they didn't want Singapore in,

489
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,280
 Singapore didn't want its own people.

490
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,160
 It just seems like after 46 hours,

491
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,840
 someone's chasing you with some clippers.

492
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,920
 Looks like Cinderella.

493
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:08,840
 They're running, they're running to the gates of the airport.

494
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,680
 The wonderful airport.

495
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,320
 Followed by the citizen man.

496
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,960
 What was the result of them if they got busted?

497
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,160
 Like, how bad is the...

498
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,560
 It does, I think you've got a large final,

499
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,760
 you've got a forced to cut off your hair.

500
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,840
 Oh okay, not death sentence.

501
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,720
 They're just running away.

502
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,120
 Not staying alive.

503
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,640
 Not staying alive, indeed.

504
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,920
 Yeah, I don't think death sentence for the BG's was there really.

505
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,360
 But then the next year, they weren't given a pass.

506
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,440
 So I think it might have all been a ploy this lot

507
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,480
 to stop the BG's coming back after they didn't like them the first time.

508
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,800
 There was, if you ever needed the government for anything,

509
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:48,440
 so let's say you needed to get some social security,

510
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,200
 or you needed someone to help you with some building permit

511
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,720
 or something, there would be signs that said

512
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,200
 "Males with long hair will be attended to last."

513
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,760
 So you just go to the back of the queue.

514
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,160
 Ouch, interesting.

515
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,200
 And long hair, the definition is quite stringent.

516
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,800
 All the Beatles would have failed.

517
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,080
 It's like long hair is the definition is if it covers your ears,

518
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,000
 or if it touches your eyebrows.

519
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,640
 Interesting.

520
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,200
 So Dan, I think if you didn't juice up your hair,

521
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,640
 or whatever it is you do with that front bit.

522
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,440
 I'd juice it up, yeah.

523
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,800
 I think that might have stretched your eyebrows.

524
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,960
 I wonder if that would trick them though,

525
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,120
 if you could, if you did juice it up into a quiff

526
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,240
 as you went through security.

527
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:27,880
 Yeah, I don't think so.

528
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,920
 I think they see through that.

529
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,640
 They probably see through.

530
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,840
 Or maybe a cool horn.

531
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,440
 Yeah, yeah, I mean it is.

532
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,560
 And you didn't go on.

533
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,280
 How interesting.

534
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,320
 You know, if you were in a public toilet in Singapore,

535
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,840
 you were legally required to flush.

536
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,200
 Really?

537
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:40,680
 Okay, yes.

538
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,760
 Like still to this day.

539
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,400
 I believe so.

540
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,040
 Yeah, right.

541
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,480
 It is, it is in the rule.

542
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:50,040
 The, I saw that and the fine from first fence is up to a thousand pounds.

543
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:56,760
 But there is a further thing that says that it is $5,000 for every day

544
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:01,000
 or part thereof during which the offense continues after conviction.

545
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,600
 So in theory, if you go for a wee and you don't flush,

546
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,360
 and then no one else uses that toilet for like three weeks,

547
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,720
 you'd have to pay $500 for each time in theory.

548
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,840
 Do they, do they rope it off and say you have to,

549
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,080
 you have to be the one to go back and do it?

550
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:21,640
 In actual fact, that bit of the law is due to another part of the,

551
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,480
 it's a public sanitation law.

552
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,880
 And that part is referring really to something else.

553
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,480
 It's like, you know, people digging up pipes when they shouldn't be.

554
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,960
 But technically, like according to the law,

555
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,840
 if you don't flush and no one flushes it for a year,

556
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,120
 you'd have to pay $180,000.

557
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:42,760
 And are there exemptions if it's the middle of the night

558
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,880
 and you didn't want to wake anyone up?

559
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,040
 I think that's fine.

560
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,280
 Did you hear about the experimental lakes area in Canada?

561
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:50,920
 I love this.

562
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,480
 No.

563
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,760
 Canada has so many lakes.

564
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:57,640
 They have set aside 58 in Ontario alone, specifically for scientific research.

565
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,480
 And they've spent 50 years studying these 58 lakes.

566
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:05,320
 And it's like a, it's like a scientific playground basically.

567
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:09,560
 So they study acid rain and they study algae blooms.

568
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:14,040
 And they, in 2018, they spilled 90 gallons of oil

569
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,640
 into one of the lakes on purpose.

570
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,400
 Because when you have an oil spill,

571
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,640
 normally people just rush there with like cotton buds

572
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,280
 and try and clean up the birds and clean up the oil and all of that.

573
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,440
 They were trying to work out how it moves,

574
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,840
 how do you deal with it, that kind of thing.

575
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,480
 Maybe it just sorts itself out.

576
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,160
 Maybe it just sorts itself out and that's what they found,

577
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,320
 that we've been wasting our time cleaning it up.

578
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,240
 Or estrogen going into the water,

579
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,600
 like synthetic estrogen in sort of medicines and things like that.

580
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,440
 What does that do to fish?

581
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:40,760
 Yes.

582
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,560
 Because it changes the sex of loads of fish and all of this.

583
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,640
 So they're like crash test dummy lakes

584
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,760
 that have massively improved water quality across the whole planet.

585
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,160
 Interesting.

586
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,840
 Because the results can be found and spread across the world.

587
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,480
 It's really cool.

588
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,120
 Nice.

589
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,840
 Well, there's also this lake which is super scientifically important

590
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,000
 because it seems to represent how humans have messed up the world.

591
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:07,080
 This is also in Canada and this is called Crawford Lake.

592
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,480
 It's 24 meters deep but it's quite small.

593
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,240
 And this is when, you know, there's this big debate

594
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,480
 about whether we're in the Anthropocene era yet.

595
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,160
 And so we, the Holocene has been in a few thousand years

596
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,640
 and then the Anthropocene is defined as the epoch

597
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,680
 where humans are having the biggest effect on the environment.

598
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,920
 And every new era, I didn't know this,

599
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,520
 every new era has to have a location, a place that represents it.

600
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:32,280
 And it was decided this tiny little lake in Ontario, Crawford Lake,

601
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:36,040
 represented it because it's so deep, it's so small,

602
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:39,000
 that the bottom waters don't mix with the top waters.

603
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,440
 So all the sediment that's been laid down on it over the years

604
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,560
 doesn't get messed around.

605
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,400
 So if you take a big bit of segment,

606
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,480
 a big cross section of sediment and look on it,

607
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,320
 you can see the mark of humans.

608
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,040
 So the first nuclear test immediately appears

609
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,480
 in your study of the sediment.

610
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,640
 When fossil fuels started to be increased in use,

611
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,640
 that immediately appears in the sediment.

612
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,640
 So there's a big thing, is Crawford Lake the start of the new epoch?

613
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,840
 And they've decided that, no, it's not.

614
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,840
 Right, okay.

615
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,920
 So they've decided we're not in the Anthropocene yet.

616
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,120
 We're not in the Anthropocene yet.

617
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,520
 If we were, it would be Crawford Lake, but apparently we're not.

618
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,280
 I feel like if they went for another lake

619
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,960
 that wasn't in the middle of nowhere,

620
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,600
 they might have worked out that actually we are in it.

621
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,360
 Well, we would have got more press at least.

622
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,040
 Yeah, if they had gone to the Aral Sea or something.

623
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,720
 Yeah, yeah.

624
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,760
 Yes.

625
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,080
 Or somewhere where, you know, it's all dried up

626
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,320
 or there's just radiation there or something.

627
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,120
 They're really strict about the definition of a new epoch.

628
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,720
 Yeah, yes.

629
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,480
 Yeah, it's a big deal, isn't it?

630
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,720
 Exactly, you can't just go naming them Willy Nilly.

631
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,840
 It does feel like we're there though.

632
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:43,080
 Um, oh, one of us, one of us around this table

633
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,000
 will have had it more.

634
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,880
 Golfers.

635
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,960
 I'm afraid not, James, let's sit back down.

636
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,840
 Will have had more, sorry, they experienced Paridolium.

637
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,680
 Will have experienced more Paridolia.

638
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,680
 And can we guess it based on knowledge of each other?

639
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:56,920
 Absolutely.

640
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,800
 It's got to be, I bet, golfers, idiots, or women.

641
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,400
 Don't feel like that.

642
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,880
 Um, maybe, maybe.

643
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,840
 James has ruled out.

644
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,720
 Oh, okay.

645
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,400
 Will James have it less because of his Affentasia thing?

646
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,280
 Face blindness.

647
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,360
 I don't know whether that means James has it less.

648
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,000
 I mean, he's all the devil in that Picora one time.

649
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,600
 So I think he's got it.

650
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,480
 Okay.

651
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,480
 I'll try and find the picture of that Picora

652
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,440
 and put it on my Instagram.

653
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,560
 Please do.

654
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,080
 Is it me because I wear glasses

655
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,240
 and the lenses might give me little,

656
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,640
 little different glamourizing?

657
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,280
 No, it's not.

658
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,680
 So let's, can we please wrap this up?

659
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,400
 Yes, all right.

660
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,440
 It's got to be women.

661
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,400
 I have two guesses.

662
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,040
 It's not just women.

663
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,720
 Is it people who eat sushi on the train?

664
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,640
 You normally see the back of people's heads

665
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,280
 as they walk away along the carriage from you.

666
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,840
 No, it's mums.

667
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,080
 It's mums.

668
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,960
 It's, it's, this is a study in a biology letter.

669
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,640
 Scientists showed 380 women, a collection of images,

670
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,720
 and the women who had given birth in the last year

671
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,120
 were likely to see faces

672
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,320
 and to perceive more face-like images in what they saw.

673
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,840
 And that might be due to more oxytocin.

674
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,080
 We don't know, but it might be sort of like

675
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,280
 the primitive nurturing instinct.

676
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,560
 They always say it's oxytocin, don't they?

677
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,400
 It's like, oh, my feet hurt.

678
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,600
 Yeah, it's oxytocin.

679
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,720
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

680
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,000
 But babies have it too.

681
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,160
 So babies will spend longer looking at collections

682
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,680
 of dots and dashes that look a bit like a face

683
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,960
 than random dots and dashes,

684
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,800
 even after a few minutes of life.

685
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,040
 So it's a really deep program thing,

686
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,160
 this face-finding software.

687
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,400
 In fact, even before life,

688
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,760
 depending on when you think life starts,

689
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,240
 abortions can't make this piece so much easier.

690
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,640
 I don't want the inbox.

691
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,720
 We have, the inbox is a busy place, Hannah.

692
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,840
 I'm so sorry.

693
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,080
 Yep.

694
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,360
 Even before they're born, babies have it,

695
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,400
 which I find extraordinary,

696
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,840
 because they've never seen a face,

697
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,080
 but they did an experiment a few years ago,

698
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,480
 where they shone a triangle of three lights,

699
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,960
 three lit dots, a woman's uterus, basically,

700
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,520
 through her skin,

701
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,240
 and they monitored what the fetus was doing inside.

702
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,400
 And if the triangle has the two dots on the top

703
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,760
 and the one dot on the bottom,

704
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,360
 then the fetus would move around

705
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,840
 and crane its head towards it to look at it.

706
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,840
 But if it had the two dots on the bottom

707
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,120
 and the one dot at the top,

708
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,880
 so oriented not like a face,

709
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,240
 the fetus wouldn't care.

710
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:11,720
 Wow.

711
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,040
 And it's never seen a face.

712
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,000
 That's, yeah.

713
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,040
 What's going on there?

714
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,480
 Unless it's got a mirror in there.

715
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,640
 What is going on there?

716
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,240
 Do they have to put it upside down,

717
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,160
 because babies are sometimes upside down in the womb?

718
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,360
 That's a really good point they must have,

719
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,000
 wasn't they?

720
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,560
 Yeah.

721
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,640
 Otherwise, the experiment is a complete wash.

722
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,440
 Oh, my God, Andy.

723
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,640
 You should write to them and check.

724
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:35,160
 A lot of people seem to leave bomb threats on sick bags,

725
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,840
 which seems quite an annoying thing to do.

726
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:42,440
 Over the years, there are constant articles of...

727
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,600
 Someone is misspelled, so I think in 2017,

728
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,560
 there's a fight from Sydney that had to be completely evacuated,

729
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,840
 because a bag said B-O-M, which doesn't...

730
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,840
 I don't know if you just seem they even meant bomb.

731
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,800
 There was another one that was found...

732
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:55,960
 Wait a minute.

733
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,960
 Was that not the one where they were going to Bombay?

734
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,400
 I'm sure there was one that that happened once.

735
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:01,880
 Really?

736
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,200
 Yeah, yeah.

737
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,560
 They wrote sort of like, M-A-N to B-O-M,

738
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,480
 because it was Manchester to Mumbai,

739
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,560
 and they saw the bomb and they thought it was a bomb.

740
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,600
 That's really funny.

741
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,800
 I think these guys were going to

742
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,600
 not Bombay, but I can't imagine that would have happened.

743
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,240
 Can I check?

744
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,000
 Is this people who are getting off a plane

745
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,240
 and are playing a kind of sick prank as they leave?

746
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,560
 They just write the word bomb on the sick bag and then they get off?

747
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,520
 We think so, yes.

748
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,360
 Which I thought the cleaners did a better job than that.

749
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,000
 But yes, it is, because there was another one that was found

750
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,760
 just after a flight had taken off from Sydney in 2004,

751
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,800
 and someone found a sick bag in the toilet that said, "Bob."

752
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,400
 Which I just think is someone naming their bag.

753
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,720
 Well, yeah, it's two dyslexic people,

754
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,360
 because both are spelled bomb wrong in both case, right?

755
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,000
 Well, yeah.

756
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,240
 One's missing the M and the other's missing the...

757
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,040
 Yeah, I mean, yes.

758
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,520
 But I mean, it could be that they weren't even trying to spell "Bob."

759
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,440
 In fact, so the plane had to turn around,

760
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,640
 had to be completely evacuated and landed back.

761
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,920
 Because they wrote "Bob" on a bag!

762
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,600
 Because they wrote "Bob" on a bag!

763
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,760
 I don't know.

764
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,160
 I know, it does seem over-cautious, doesn't it?

765
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,920
 And the stewards and stewardesses said afterwards

766
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,600
 that actually, apparently,

767
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,160
 they commonly use the letters B-O-B anyway,

768
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,160
 a slang for best on board,

769
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,400
 meaning "fitty" in Isle Sever.

770
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,280
 Oh!

771
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,840
 So actually, it could have just been a stewardess, right?

772
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,760
 People are always calling me "Bob" on the planes.

773
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,920
 Yeah, that's why.

774
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,680
 That's why I'm the fittest one on the plane.

775
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:20,840
 Yeah.

776
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,360
 But you also charter your own flights everywhere

777
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,320
 and you're the only passenger.

778
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:26,120
 These are the helicopter flights with your wife,

779
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:26,840
 or it's just you two.

780
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:32,040
 Do you know, there's a really cool thing that you can see online

781
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,480
 called lightningmap.org,

782
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,040
 and it shows you where basically every lightning strike

783
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,800
 is happening live on our planet right now.

784
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,240
 Where's our closest lightning star?

785
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,960
 Dan's actually got the app open right now.

786
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,160
 The closest to us.

787
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:43,800
 Yeah, yeah.

788
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,800
 Let me make my way back to...

789
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,520
 No, no.

790
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,360
 If Panama's there, we're in the other direction.

791
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:48,760
 Yeah, yeah.

792
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,240
 I was...

793
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,360
 Dan's going the longer way.

794
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,800
 I was going, I was going, yeah.

795
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:57,000
 Don't police.

796
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,120
 The route Dan thinks it's best to get from Panama to the UK.

797
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:00,840
 Yeah, man.

798
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,760
 Well, you're going to fall off the end-of-flat-earth dream.

799
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,280
 Ooh, it goes right round, mate.

800
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,400
 Now, that's South Africa.

801
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,920
 I'm trying because I'm trying to bring...

802
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,960
 I'm trying to do this...

803
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,320
 The pinchy thing to get it in.

804
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,520
 Come on.

805
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:14,520
 Oh, Columbus missed out not having you on board, mate.

806
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,000
 All right, here we go.

807
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,800
 Okay, we got it, we got it.

808
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,520
 Here we go.

809
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,440
 Okay.

810
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,360
 This absolutely captivating audio.

811
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,320
 I can see some in...

812
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,880
 It's all in a different language.

813
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,040
 That's in Albania.

814
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,400
 Oh, nice.

815
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:31,960
 All right, look at...

816
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,880
 If you're listening in Albania to us live,

817
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:37,080
 as this is going out, then watch out.

818
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,120
 A South of Tirana.

819
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,320
 Oh, really?

820
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,000
 So if you're in the North, you're cool.

821
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,560
 Okay.

822
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,640
 Apparently, we get 40 strikes every second,

823
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:48,520
 so more than 3 million lightning strikes per day on Earth,

824
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,800
 which is a lot.

825
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,600
 The worst sick bag of all time.

826
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,680
 This is, according to expert Danny Cahalan from Sydney.

827
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,200
 He's another baggist, I believe.

828
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,600
 He said the worst ever design was the 1970s.

829
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,640
 It's called the sick sack.

830
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,520
 And the problem is it's in an envelope itself,

831
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,840
 which makes it quite fiddly.

832
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,000
 Like, you're fiddling, you're getting a bag out of an envelope,

833
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,480
 you're opening...

834
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,760
 You know, it's often a quite old-time pressurized situation

835
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,960
 if you're throwing up on a flight.

836
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,240
 Yeah, you don't want to be opening.

837
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,920
 You don't want to have to get your letter opener out, do you?

838
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:21,800
 In 1928, they tried anti-air-sickness fumes

839
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,000
 throughout aeroplanes.

840
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,480
 Interesting.

841
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:23,640
 Really?

842
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,400
 And that was a mixture of oxygen and cinnamon smell.

843
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,200
 Oh, lovely.

844
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,720
 And hopefully not tonka bean.

845
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,360
 But they would send it through the plane,

846
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,160
 and the idea was it would stop people from feeling sick.

847
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:35,640
 Really?

848
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:36,920
 Did it work?

849
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,080
 Well, we don't have it today, do we?

850
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,280
 I don't think so, really.

851
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,480
 I think, really, in those days,

852
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,160
 people didn't really know what caused it.

853
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:47,000
 There was an article by a sum fund called the Guggenheim Fund

854
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,160
 who claimed that it was a psychological state.

855
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:52,120
 So, as in, it was just all in your head,

856
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,640
 and it could be cured by an increase in confidence in flyers.

857
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,760
 Maybe, I think I sort of buy that.

858
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,240
 Do you?

859
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,840
 No, trouble sickness is real.

860
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,520
 Definitely it is.

861
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,720
 But I just think if I'm nervous,

862
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,720
 I'm likely to throw up on any given day.

863
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,840
 That's fair enough.

864
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,680
 That's why you vomit before the forecast every second.

865
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,400
 Every week.

866
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,800
 Grandmaster Flash collects mugs.

867
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,160
 No way.

868
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:13,480
 Yeah?

869
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,800
 He's got 5,000, he says, in a special room.

870
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,800
 And he says, "The room temperature is correct."

871
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,840
 What?

872
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,640
 Just room temperature, isn't it?

873
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:27,320
 Mugs don't have an incredibly narrow range of temperatures

874
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,280
 they can perform in.

875
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:32,200
 The whole point of a mug is that they can go to 100 degrees.

876
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:38,040
 But at least we know it's not like minus 200 degrees

877
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,560
 or plus 5,000 degrees.

878
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,040
 He keeps it very carefully between minus 200

879
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,120
 and plus 5,000 degrees in that room.

880
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:47,720
 His room salesman absolutely saw him coming.

881
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:58,280
 Okay, that's it.

882
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,960
 That is all of our outtakes.

883
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,240
 Thanks, everyone.

884
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,400
 If you want to write into us about anything

885
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,680
 that we've said during the course of this compilation,

886
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,600
 why not drop us a line?

887
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,480
 Send an email to podcast@qi.com.

888
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,520
 Andy will read these emails and he likes to cherry pick

889
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,800
 the best of them and bring them to our mailbag episode

890
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,480
 that we do as part of Clubfish.

891
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,880
 So that will be out in the next couple of weeks.

892
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,840
 Otherwise, head to the main episode this Friday

893
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:28,200
 to find out more details about our upcoming live shows.

894
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,640
 And we'll see you in a couple of weeks.

895
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,640
 All right, Clubfishers, catch you soon.

896
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,280
 Goodbye.

897
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,940
 (upbeat music)

898
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,400
 (upbeat music)

899
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,980
 (upbeat music)
