00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
 (upbeat music)

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.560
 - Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.440
 Before we get going, I just want to let you know

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.560
 a couple of things.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.860
 Firstly, the episode you're about to hear

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.100
 is the last ever episode to be recorded

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.580
 at the QI offices in Covent Garden

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.540
 as we pack up shop and move on to our new offices

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:18.500
 in Hoburn.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.000
 So we thought, you know, if we're gonna go out,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.260
 we should go out strong.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.420
 So we reached out to nerd royalty

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.620
 and fortunately she said, yes, it's Hannah Fry.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.100
 My goodness, we are such huge fans of her at the QI office.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.420
 I think every elf has probably read her books.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.360
 Hello World, if you've not read that by the way,

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.820
 is an incredible book.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.900
 I'm sure you've all seen her TV series

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.460
 which was out November of last year on BBC Two

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.580
 called The Secret Genius of Modern Life,

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.380
 was absolutely phenomenal.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.740
 She makes incredible TV, she writes incredible books

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.220
 and she is such a good guest on this week's episode.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.020
 You have to by the way, check out her latest show.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.080
 You can find it on bloomberg.com

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.100
 and it's called The Future with Hannah Fry.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.580
 It is a look into the world of scientists and inventors

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.300
 who are changing the way the world is gonna be

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.540
 over the next century.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.140
 These are people who are looking into seeing

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.540
 if we can live a life beyond 150 years old

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.260
 who are working out whether or not computers

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.140
 will be able to read our emotions

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.420
 and trying to find out if they can make a planet

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.100
 that will be utterly transformed

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.060
 by unlimited clean energy.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.580
 So do check that out, it's on bloomberg.com

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.800
 or you can find the entire series on YouTube as well.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.280
 And otherwise, next time you happen to be

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.280
 in Covent Garden, do take a walk down Maiden Lane

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.040
 and if you look above the barbershop

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.160
 that's called Ruffians, you'll see a window there.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.840
 That's where we were for nine years.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.400
 James Andy, Anna and I just sat there dorking out

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.920
 and we're gonna miss the place

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.520
 but we're looking forward to the next chapter

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.160
 and that will be next week's episode.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.280
 But for now, let's give a good old goodbye

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.600
 with Hannah Frye to the QI offices in Covent Garden

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.680
 on with the show.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.260
 (upbeat music)

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:12.460
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.160
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.140
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.360
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.320
 I'm sitting here with James Harkin,

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.440
 Andrew Hunter Murray and Hannah Frye.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.840
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.660
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.760
 and in a particular order, here we go.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.800
 Starting with fact number one and that is Hannah.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.480
 - Oh, me, my turn.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.800
 Okay, here's my facts.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.800
 The Malyard reaction, so the thing that makes your bread

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.920
 turn brown when you toast it is actually the same thing

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.440
 that makes fake tan work.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.000
 Interesting.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.340
 - Okay.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.280
 - I mean, do you want more?

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.120
 Do you want more?

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.000
 - Yeah, so you're being--

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.120
 - You're underimpressed.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.080
 - You are being toasted.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.120
 No, it's just so weird.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.520
 I just, I try to make the connection between

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.080
 you've been toasted effectively.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.840
 - You would think like if you had a normal suntan,

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.160
 you know, like you'll lay in the sun,

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.440
 you would think that's being toasted.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.040
 - That's toasted, exactly.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.520
 But this is a spray on or this is a cream, right?

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.560
 So there's no toasty.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.080
 - What if you put fake tan on bread?

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.920
 That's what I wanted to know.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:15.760
 Good question.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.580
 - This is a great question.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:17.440
 Someone needs to experiment.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.640
 - Yeah, perfect toast every time.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.600
 - Okay, so the best thing about this,

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.800
 my favorite thing about this is this was discovered

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.400
 completely by accident.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.760
 So there was a researcher called Ava Wittgenstein

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.800
 and she was looking into, there's some children

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.540
 who were having problems, their bodies were having problems

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.200
 in breaking down glucose.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.880
 So there's a sort of simplified sugar

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.400
 that you find in the body,

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.920
 which is called dihydroxyacetone, easy for me to say.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.080
 And she was seeing if you could feed them this sugar

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.160
 whether their bodies could break down

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.400
 that sort of simplified sugar.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.000
 And every now and then, some of these kids

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.800
 would accidentally dribble a little bit of medicine

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.400
 down their chin and when they did,

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.280
 they would have a perfectly orange stain.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.360
 - Wow, so funny, yeah.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.640
 - And then she was like, what's going on here?

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.960
 And what she realized is that you have

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.960
 these amino acids in the skin

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.960
 and when that reacts with the DHA, the dihydroxyacetone,

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.160
 it creates that sort of reaction

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.080
 that is the same thing that ends up

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.520
 turning your skin brown in the sun,

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.720
 that is the melanin in your skin.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.280
 Anyway, this idea was picked up by Copitone

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.760
 and then released into Faketown.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.800
 And it's still the same thing, still the same stuff,

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.960
 the DHA, which is, I think.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.200
 But they've just, they've become much better

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.320
 at making it less smelly and less orange.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.640
 - So did Ava Wittgenstein, did she see this little bit

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.360
 of orange-ness and think, what if that was my whole face?

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.800
 Or she's more of a scientist

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.320
 than someone else picked up on the idea?

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.920
 - She's more of the scientist.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.760
 I mean, look, who doesn't want to have

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.880
 an entirely orange face?

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:49.960
 (laughing)

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.360
 I'm sure she had ambition.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.840
 - But here's the question that I've got.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.960
 I spent ages, hours, trying to find anything

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.680
 about Ava Wittgenstein.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.520
 There is nothing that I could find.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.360
 - Were you trying to find out

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.160
 if she was related to Ludwig?

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.480
 - No, I don't know, no, 'cause I did.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.800
 Right, and did you find anything?

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.200
 No, exactly, there's nothing about,

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.200
 so she does this in the '50s

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.680
 and then she kind of disappears.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.560
 And I asked a friend who knows how to go

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.240
 into sort of American records

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.040
 just to see if he could find her.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.640
 And he searched the whole records.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.280
 All he could find was an Ava Wittgenstein

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.520
 who died age 97 in North Carolina.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.440
 We don't know if it's her,

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.960
 but she showed up as being on a government watch list.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:26.800
 - Oh!

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.360
 - So it's kind of a cool idea that maybe Ava became, yeah.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.920
 - Hey, maybe she became a spy

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.520
 and could like change her disguise for going orange

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.360
 and then back to white.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.200
 - That's the original mission impossible, isn't it?

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.160
 - She runs into a tanning booth and comes out.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.440
 - Half an hour later, completely unrecognizable.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.360
 - What a disguise, yeah.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.240
 So have any of you guys ever been faked-hanned?

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.080
 - No. - At all?

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.920
 - No. - I'm nervous.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:48.760
 - Almost non-stop.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.200
 (laughing)

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.280
 I'm not joking.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.200
 Do you, like, my skin is, okay,

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.360
 it's important for anybody who doesn't know what I look like.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.600
 I am the most ginger person that a ginger person can be.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.200
 Right, like, I am fully ginger,

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.000
 which means that my skin is not just white,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.600
 it's like translucent with a hint of blue.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.200
 And so, I put on faked-hanned

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.160
 just to make my skin look like pasty skin.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.480
 - Wow.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.560
 Do you have it on right now?

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.720
 - I don't, actually.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.960
 But I have got bronzer on, can you not tell?

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.520
 - Well, you just, your skin looks fine, it looks normal.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.640
 - Interesting though, that's, okay,

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.640
 but you can be kind of under pale.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.640
 Like, you're not even pale.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.440
 - No, I aspire to be pale.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.280
 - So have you tried that,

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.360
 'cause I know there are loads of different methods

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.920
 that you can do, there are the beds on there

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:32.920
 and then there are the booths.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.040
 - Oh, no, so beds are not faked-hanned.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.480
 So the beds, you go in, that's a real tan.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.520
 - That's very, it's looked down on.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.920
 - Oh, okay, it's not very good for you, yeah.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.280
 - It's a little bit skin-cancery.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.400
 - Right, so I didn't realize that these,

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.400
 the spray that you can put on, is also a risk.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.240
 - Is it?

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.040
 - Because, well, no, I mean, not, sorry.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.440
 Okay, just for any big tanners listening

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.800
 or sort of like legal teams, whatever.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.200
 Point is that I, what a backtrack.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.000
 - Big tan might be coming to get you.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.160
 - It's actually good for you.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.080
 It's actually, no, it makes you look like

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.680
 you are protected from the sun, but you're not.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:09.520
 - I see.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.720
 - It hasn't had the actual effect.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.720
 It's reacted, it's produced these pigments,

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.400
 these melanoidins in your skin,

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.360
 but you are then totally unprotected from sun.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.000
 - So some people would think you,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.960
 and I don't think this is even proper,

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.920
 but some people think you get a little bit of a tan

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.800
 and that will protect you from other, you know, stronger.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.600
 - From the sun, yeah, yeah, yeah, which it doesn't.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.520
 - This definitely doesn't, this is just, yeah.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.720
 - And doesn't it, this is a bit sciency for me,

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.680
 but doesn't it in, sorry, doesn't it actually kind of

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:38.400
 make you more susceptible to having the sun's harm you?

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.480
 - Don't know, I haven't got any research on that.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.400
 - I mean, I think no, I think no.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.160
 - Okay, there was a study that was done in 2007,

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.720
 which showed, and this was by Katinka Jung.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.880
 I don't know if there's any relation to Carl.

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:52.720
 (laughing)

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.200
 I don't know if it consigned the situation, yeah.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.720
 This was in Berlin, which showed that 24 hours after

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.160
 having the tan are on, ultraviolet,

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.640
 you become more susceptible to it in a 24 hour period.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.760
 - According to this study in 2002 or so.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.620
 - Interesting, look, all I know is I never leave

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.840
 the Blumen House without fact 50 on.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.480
 I was once, oh, oh, oh, oh, God, yeah.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.320
 So I was once in Cuba, don't like to brag.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:19.680
 I was wearing fact 50 and sat in the shade all day,

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.920
 and I was burnt so badly from the reflection of the sun

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.320
 on the sand, but I got blisters, right?

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.000
 That's the sort of situation.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.120
 You people without ginger hair, you don't know,

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.760
 you don't know that how we suffer.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.440
 - I do have transparent skin as well,

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.520
 actually, I like Irish skin, even though I have dark hair.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.360
 Like, when I was in a similar part of the world,

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:41.960
 I put sun cream on, back to 50, every 20 minutes,

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.920
 and one of the times I didn't put it on properly,

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:47.080
 and I blistered in the shape of a handprint on my chest.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.120
 - Oh, God. - Yeah.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.160
 - I went to a pig farm in Scotland recently.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.000
 (laughing)

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.100
 - Guys, all these show bizangos that we've got coming.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.760
 - Again, again, don't like to brag.

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.080
 (laughing)

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.800
 - What I hope you're gonna say is you realize

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:03.080
 that pigs shelter from the sun by rubbing themselves in mud,

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.120
 and you did the same?

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.760
 (laughing)

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.400
 - I mean, close, close.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.720
 It's because you said Irish skin,

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.360
 and when I was going around this pig farm,

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.840
 I realized just, I mean, genuinely,

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.880
 these pigs have identical skin to me.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.240
 (laughing)

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.280
 Identical skin.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:20.840
 And I was like, why do all these pigs have Irish skin?

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:24.600
 And as you say, it makes them really susceptible to sunburn.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.640
 So that's why they have to keep them in sheds.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.960
 But actually, the reason for having Irish skin

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:32.600
 as a bit grim is because when you are breeding them for meat,

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.200
 you can see if there's bad meat much easier

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.360
 through see-through skin.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.600
 - No. - Wow.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.280
 - What? - Is that true?

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:40.560
 - That is super fussing.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.640
 - So look, you and me, if we ever get hung up for meat.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:44.920
 - Yeah. - Wow.

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.120
 - Do you both have any advantage to having pale skin?

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.280
 Can anyone see something?

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.520
 - We are vitamin D superheroes.

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.360
 - Okay, right.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.280
 - Like, that's genuinely a superpower of pale skin people.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.120
 - What does that mean?

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.720
 - We make it. - Like, we synthesize it

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.560
 more easily. - Yeah.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.120
 - So great. - Not enough that you can come in

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.600
 and, you know-- - Extract it for me.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.440
 - Extract it for me. - No, no, no.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.480
 - Can't make a vitamin D farm out of us.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.720
 - We haven't tried yet, though.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.960
 - I read an article that said,

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.160
 "The Maillard reaction is by far

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.520
 "the most widely-practiced chemical reaction in the world."

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:16.000
 - Hmm, that's so cool.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.840
 - Well, hang on, what about breathing?

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:21.040
 - Breathing us, that counts as a chemical reaction, yeah.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.560
 Well, this was at the 100-year anniversary

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.800
 of the Maillard reaction. - Right.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.920
 - Which is a huge thing. - They got skin in the game.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.280
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:31.760
 And it was a chemist who said it.

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.520
 Nobel Prize winner, Jean-Marie Lane, who said it.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.840
 But there was a huge conference.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.160
 It was like 100 years since it got discovered.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.680
 And there's a group, the Maillard reaction group.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.240
 - The Maillard reaction society have conferences

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.120
 just about the Maillard reaction.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.720
 Yeah, as you say, James, they were established in 2005

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.840
 and it's just food-browning scientists meeting up and--

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:53.680
 - Sounds great.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.280
 - I think a while of the time, I bet.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.360
 But actually, I think James's case

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.320
 said it's the most practiced chemical reaction on the planet.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.360
 - Well, this was Jean-Marie Lane who said this.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.640
 - I'm supporting it, James, because not only

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.920
 is everyone who's ever made a slice of toast engaged in it,

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.360
 but also the Maillard reaction is happening

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.520
 in our bodies all the time.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:10.840
 And so when you toast something,

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.880
 it happens at a very high temperature.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:17.520
 But generally, it's a reaction between amino acids,

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.080
 which are the building blocks of proteins,

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.680
 we've all made lots of proteins, and sugars.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.680
 So that is constantly happening

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:27.960
 in the human body anyway, but at a very slow rate,

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.640
 much, much more slowly than toasting

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.040
 or the faked anything.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.040
 - Are you saying I'm orange on the inside, too?

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.160
 - I'm afraid so.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.520
 (laughing)

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:39.280
 And it's bad for you, though, 'cause when you make toast,

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.880
 the Maillard reaction produces about 1,000 new molecules,

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.800
 you know, it's really complicated.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.640
 - One of the chemicals it makes is acrylamide.

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.840
 And acrylamide is carcinogenic.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:51.200
 You know, if you have just a slice of toast every day,

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.320
 it's not nearly enough to be a problem.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:56.400
 But they found that the Maillard process

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.240
 that they use in highly processed foods,

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.080
 so if you're making some really highly processed food

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.280
 and you want it to last for ages,

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.760
 one way to do it is to heat it up really, really quickly

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.720
 at a massive, massive temperature.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.600
 And that kind of Maillard reaction

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.040
 gives this acrylamide.

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:10.880
 - Yeah.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.280
 - You know, talk about processed foods, though.

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.840
 So, okay, if you're like home cooking

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.080
 and you're browning off the chicken

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.240
 and then browning off this thing

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.680
 to try and get loads of flavor,

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.080
 something I've discovered recently,

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.440
 don't bother doing any of that, right?

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.960
 You can get MSG from the internet, right?

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:26.800
 Buy it, right?

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.600
 Little sprinkle of MSG, it makes everything taste amazing.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.000
 And because I am a scientific in nature, right?

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.880
 I've A/B tested this stuff with guests

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:35.720
 coming around my house.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:36.560
 - Oh, right.

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:37.400
 - Sorry, what's A/B testing?

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.320
 - It's where you basically have one bowl with,

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.920
 one bowl without, and see which one goes down quicker.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.120
 - Oh. - That's interesting.

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:43.960
 - Yeah. - Oh, wow.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.560
 - Did they know they were in an experiment

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:46.400
 when they came around?

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.200
 - They did not tell me to come to my house.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.520
 - I would say it's an assumption.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.880
 If you ever go and visit Hannah,

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.720
 it's like you're probably in an experiment.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.040
 - You sign this release form at the door,

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.440
 and it's not really explained,

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.400
 but it's, what was in the bowls?

00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:59.240
 Do you mind me asking?

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.240
 - I made a chicken curry.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.080
 Look, don't get me wrong,

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.240
 my chicken curry is absolutely delicious.

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.960
 (all laughing)

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.280
 Both bowls were finished eventually.

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.400
 - But the one with the Kraken.

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:13.320
 - The one with the Kraken was more enjoyed, yeah.

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.440
 - Well, I mean, MSG's my, I grew up in Hong Kong,

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.760
 that's my life, MSG.

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:17.600
 I'm very excited about that.

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.400
 - Do you have buckets of it that you like spoon from?

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.280
 - I do get pot noodle and I collect

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:24.080
 just the sachets so that I can use it on other things.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.080
 - Are those sachets of MSG that come with pot noodles?

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:29.200
 - You know, MSG is inside the actual powder

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.600
 that you get of the actually--

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:31.920
 - I didn't know that.

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.280
 - I can't remember when I last had a pot noodle,

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:34.200
 but it's been a while.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.040
 - Yeah.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.800
 - Some of us like, move faster than others.

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.640
 (all laughing)

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.720
 - This is my version of, I was in Cuba recently,

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.800
 it's the start of my pot noodle in the last few years.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.960
 (all laughing)

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:48.760
 - Can I tell you something about airline food,

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:50.000
 specifically relating to--

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:50.840
 - Yeah.

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:55.840
 - You can't do the Maillard reaction on a plane.

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:57.360
 - Okay. - That's interesting.

00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:00.000
 - Most planes these days don't have stoves, right?

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.080
 - Well, you need an open flame, also.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:01.920
 - Oh, hang on.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.400
 - An open flame. - Sure, sure.

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.760
 - So, how do they heat the food, the microwave it?

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:06.600
 - Yeah, okay.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.840
 - What's the maximum temperature

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.240
 microwaveable food gets up to?

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:12.120
 It's 100 degrees because it's heating the water molecules,

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.760
 which get to 100, blah, blah, blah.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.600
 So, you can't, that's part of the reason

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:17.600
 why plane food tastes bad.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.200
 I know it affects your taste buds big down.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.480
 - If I brought a Bunsen burner

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:23.360
 onto a plane, it would be possible.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.680
 - Yeah, unfortunately,

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.440
 it's actually on that little card at check-in.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.800
 They do say, "Have you brought a Bunsen burner

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:29.640
 "for your toast?"

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:31.360
 There's a picture of a guy with a medieval toasting fork

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.200
 as well. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.040
 - Really strict.

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.920
 - But, no, if you put it on those little plastic bags,

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:35.880
 you can get that through.

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:36.720
 - Oh, yeah, sure.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:37.560
 (all laughing)

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.960
 - Yeah, but lots of food is pre-Maillard-ed

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.520
 before it's loaded onto the plane.

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:42.640
 - And then microwaved.

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:43.480
 - And then it's microwaved,

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.400
 and then you get a bit of the flavor still, but yeah.

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:50.600
 - The Maillard reaction works on poo.

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.360
 And that's why we have,

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.320
 that's why we have coprolites.

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.480
 - Oh. - Yeah.

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:56.320
 - What a coprolite.

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.440
 - So, a coprolite is a fossilized poo.

00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.280
 - Right.

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.600
 - Our listeners will know that.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:01.680
 (all laughing)

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.880
 - Of course they will, don't call us.

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:06.000
 - But basically, let's say you have a dinosaur,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.160
 they do a poo.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.920
 The Maillard reaction works on the surface of the poo.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.480
 That's what crusts it over.

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.320
 And then eventually,

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.080
 that's what helps it become a coprolite.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.400
 - Wow, cool.

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:17.360
 - So if I take my dog out for a walk,

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:20.560
 spray the result with fake tan.

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:21.880
 - Yeah.

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:23.640
 Sprinkle a little MSG on it.

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:25.880
 (all laughing)

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.200
 - Come back millions of years later, there's a chance.

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.040
 - Leave a sign near it, do not touch.

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.320
 Experiment in progress.

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.320
 One of Hamlet's experiments.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.160
 - Yeah.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:34.000
 - Oh, fuck it.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.440
 - Let's leave it alone, all right?

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.840
 Don't you said Hong Kong?

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:37.680
 'Cause we were talking about MSG.

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.520
 - Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:39.440
 - Have you heard of Wok Hei?

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.840
 Is this familiar?

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.080
 - Wok Hei. - Wok Hei, yeah.

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.720
 It's the breath of the wok, right?

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.080
 - Oh, it's the quality that if you're cooking in China

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.360
 and particularly in Hong Kong,

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:53.120
 it's the perfect seared taste of the rice

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.120
 that's been cooked in a wok.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:57.480
 And it's because the rice gets tossed really fast,

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.440
 loads of times, a few times a second.

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:00.560
 It uses the mild reaction.

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:04.040
 And if you get the trajectory of the rice right

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.480
 and it's cooking at the right temperature,

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.480
 it's absolutely delicious, apparently.

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.480
 And there's a restaurant called The Chairman in Hong Kong,

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:12.120
 which is one of the top restaurants in Hong Kong.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:14.720
 And chefs there have to spend a year practicing

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.760
 the tossing of the rice in the pan.

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.320
 They're only allowed to cook for other chefs.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.520
 They're not allowed to cook stir-fry for customers.

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.120
 They're not allowed to cook a stir-fry for a year

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.640
 so they can get the tossing right.

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:24.800
 - That's amazing.

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:29.800
 - I have heard about washing woks being a bad thing, right?

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.040
 Like you're supposed to...

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:31.880
 - I bet.

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.560
 - You're not supposed to wash your teapot kind of thing

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:34.400
 that's well, right?

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.200
 Yeah, that's just lazy people, isn't it?

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.040
 - Oh, really, yeah.

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.920
 (laughing)

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.520
 - Yeah, I seasoned a pan recently.

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:42.800
 What does that mean?

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.280
 - It's where you get a new...

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:45.280
 - Fried on your face.

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.120
 - I don't know.

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:47.040
 - It was quite the thing.

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.440
 - Well, it really was, it was kind of,

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.120
 yeah, I'm living that Fraser life now.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:51.480
 I really am.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:52.760
 - That's what noddles are for you.

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.120
 (laughing)

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:57.240
 - You toss your pot noodle for a year before you eat it.

00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:59.560
 (laughing)

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:01.480
 - It's where you get a new cast iron pan,

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.960
 no nonstick stuff, just pure, you know,

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.040
 lovely cast iron, whatever.

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:07.040
 And then you put this tiny layer of oil in

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.280
 and you cook that very slowly.

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:10.960
 And then it kind of bonds with the pan.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:11.800
 - Right.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:12.880
 - And then you do that a few times,

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.400
 again and again and again and do it all over the pan.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.520
 You're kind of lathering the pan

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.640
 and then making a tiny thin layer.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:20.200
 And it makes it really good at cooking,

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.720
 I don't know, more stuff.

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:22.800
 - Andy's usually very private.

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.080
 That's his personal, the thing is we've

00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:24.920
 (indistinct)

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:26.240
 - I feel like I've learned a lot of it.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.400
 (laughing)

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:28.240
 - Can we cut that bit out?

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.560
 Sorry, I can't give you too much away.

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.160
 I've got a bit, I'm exposed.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.760
 (upbeat music)

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:38.040
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two.

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:39.720
 And that is Andy.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:43.160
 - My fact is that Japan's just found 7,000 islands

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.480
 that it didn't know it had.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:49.800
 Japan's doubled basically in one specific respect.

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:50.640
 (laughing)

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:51.880
 - Not in size, just in numbers.

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:52.880
 - No, it's still exactly the same size.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:53.720
 - Wait, how many did it have before?

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:54.560
 - Yeah, exactly, yeah.

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:56.240
 It had 6,800 before.

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.600
 - Oh, why is it still double?

00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:58.440
 - It's more than double.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.280
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.120
 - That's a good day, isn't it?

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:00.960
 - It's a great day.

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.200
 - 'Cause it would be great if one of them was like,

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:04.640
 Honshu or whatever, the islands.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.760
 (laughing)

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:07.800
 But they're all small, right?

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:08.640
 They're all super small.

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:09.480
 - Unfortunately.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:10.760
 - I feel like we need more detail.

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:11.960
 Where were they?

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.080
 - They were all around the main ones, you know,

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.360
 and offshore mostly.

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:19.920
 - Did they find them all in one day, in one go?

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:21.920
 - Well, they've been doing some digital mapping.

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:25.120
 Japan since 1985 has had the same set of maps,

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:27.320
 which I think are based on older maps,

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:30.320
 whereas now you can survey much more accurately.

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:32.480
 And so there are now 14,000 Japanese islands.

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:34.840
 - Are any of them in like the South China Sea

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:37.240
 and claimed by other people, do we think?

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:41.520
 I don't know how many are totally undisputed.

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:42.560
 (laughing)

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:44.120
 - Because, you know, the Kuril Islands,

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.120
 which is in the North of Japan,

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:47.920
 which is claimed also by Russia.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:48.760
 - Yes.

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:51.000
 - That is a dispute that's still been going

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.400
 since World War II,

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.040
 and which means that technically World War II

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:58.000
 hasn't finished, because Japan and the Soviet Union

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.880
 haven't agreed on who owns these islands,

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.000
 and it was part of World War II.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.100
 - That's seriously not our...

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:04.520
 - No, like the last time they talked about it was like,

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.160
 I don't know, 10 years ago, something like that.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.480
 They didn't agree with it then,

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.120
 and I can't see them agreeing with it now.

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.640
 - That's amazing, what amazing tourist attraction

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.900
 that you can go there and you're in World War II.

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:13.740
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:16.120
 - And so one of the other things to say is that Japan's

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.640
 major land masses, like the four or five islands,

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:22.720
 I think predominantly four are 90% of the land mass.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:24.800
 So that's, we're talking about the final 3% here

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:28.400
 that make up the 14,000 extra islands that they have, yeah.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.320
 - Are any of them big enough to put a house on?

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.000
 - Yeah. - Yeah, I'm sure, yeah.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.760
 - You might not want to put a house on them

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.040
 just in case of sea levels.

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.640
 - Yeah, I mean, if you're a short-term list about it.

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:38.480
 - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.640
 If you're a dodgy property developer,

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.360
 this is a boom for you, this is great.

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.760
 - But it also depends on what you call an island, right?

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:47.680
 What's the difference between a rock and an island size?

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:50.840
 But where does one end and the other one start, right?

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:52.600
 And in Scotland, they had a traditional thing

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.600
 which was if you could keep a sheep on it, it's an island.

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:58.280
 And if you can't keep a sheep on it, it's a rock.

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.680
 - But when you say keep a sheep, you mean can the sheep,

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.000
 is there enough grass for the sheep to support itself?

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.680
 - Can it survive for, yeah, a few years?

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:05.200
 - I mean, because presumably you can keep a sheep

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:08.000
 on visit in any rock, it just depends on the level of cruelty

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.360
 you're willing to. - Just stick on strong arms.

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:11.520
 - It's spiky, you know?

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:16.440
 But yeah, so like what I'm saying, I guess,

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:18.840
 is like a lot of these islands will be super small

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:22.680
 and whether they're officially rocks or islands,

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:24.520
 we don't have a way of deciding.

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:26.440
 That's why you can't say how many islands there are

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.400
 in the UK or how many there are in Canada

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.480
 or even which country has the most islands

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:32.480
 because different people count them in different ways.

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:36.160
 - You also couldn't say the circumference of the rock

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.320
 to give you a definition of whether it's a rock

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.400
 or an island because you know this,

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:44.280
 if you measure the circumference or the length of a coastline,

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:47.320
 it depends on how big your measuring stick is,

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:48.520
 it's to the answer that you get.

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:49.360
 - Go on.

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:50.880
 - Okay, you're close.

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.120
 - You're about to get masked.

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:53.960
 - Buckle up.

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:56.880
 - Okay, so if you just have a map,

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:58.840
 let's say of the British coastline

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.160
 and you get like a 30 centimeter ruler

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:02.400
 and you go right, how long's the coastline,

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.760
 da, da, da, da, da, like, you know, whatever.

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:07.920
 But then if you got a more accurate measuring stick, right,

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.560
 so one that you were measuring to the millimeter,

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:10.640
 you could kind of get in there

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:12.440
 in the nooks and crannies a little bit more

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:14.040
 and go all around them, right?

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:16.480
 And actually you will get longer and longer

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.640
 and longer each time

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.640
 because every time you add in a little crevice,

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:20.640
 a little nook and cranny,

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:22.440
 you're kind of adding length to it.

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:27.440
 So in the limit of looking at an infinitely detailed ruler

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:31.000
 and the infinitesimally small, like nooks and crannies,

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.120
 you have an infinite coastline.

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:34.080
 - Wow, that's so cool, that's so interesting.

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:35.600
 - Can I tell you a story about my favorite island

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:37.520
 in the world? - Yes.

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:41.640
 - Okay, so there's a little place in France,

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.680
 this is not my favorite island in the world.

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.280
 There's a little lake and it's got a little island in it, right?

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:47.920
 So you cross every little bridge and then you get it.

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.040
 And then when you're on the island,

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:52.080
 it's got a pond in the island, right?

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.200
 Oh, maybe sort of like a small lake,

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.360
 pond to lake, how do you know?

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:57.240
 - What really is a rock pond?

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.120
 - Anyway, in the middle of the pond,

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:00.880
 there's a little island, right?

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:05.280
 So you've got an island in a lake and on that island,

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:08.000
 there is a lake which also has an island in it.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.600
 So essentially recursive islands.

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:12.680
 Now, there are a few of these places around the world,

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:15.880
 but the best one of all is called Vulcan Point

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:17.320
 and it's in the Philippines.

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:22.320
 And it's a tiny little island that is inside a lake, right?

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:24.440
 - Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:27.720
 - It's a very, very small little island like a little rock.

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:30.760
 And that lake is inside a volcano,

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:36.400
 which is itself surrounded by water,

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:40.120
 which is on an island, right, in a lake.

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:41.040
 And it's in the Philippines,

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.240
 which is in itself an island.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.440
 - Wow.

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.240
 - Now, the thing is about Vulcan Point,

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.760
 is that unfortunately the volcano exploded

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:47.720
 and the Vulcan Point was destroyed.

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:51.520
 But there is nonetheless photographic evidence

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:54.080
 of the point where there was this level

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.920
 of recursive islands.

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:56.760
 - And do you know what?

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:58.120
 I think you could put a sheep on it.

00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:58.960
 - Really?

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.000
 - Yeah, it had a great big spike in the middle.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.640
 - Can keep a lamb kebab on it.

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:02.960
 (laughing)

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.240
 - Wow. - That's so cool.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.600
 - That's extraordinary. - That's so cool.

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:06.440
 I love that.

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:07.920
 - There's a really cool island on Japan,

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:10.520
 which is called Gunkanjima Island.

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:13.680
 And what's amazing about this is it was once

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:17.360
 the most densely populated place on our planet.

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:19.520
 It was, it's quite small.

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:20.560
 - Does that mean there's a lot of people

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:21.400
 or is it very, very small?

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:23.800
 - A lot of people for a very small island.

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:24.920
 It's a mixture of the two.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.000
 So this is the 1900s.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.440
 And this island, there was Mitsubishi.

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:30.920
 They looked at it and thought there would be

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:33.400
 a lot of rich submarine coal deposit underneath.

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.480
 So what they did was they built these buildings

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.040
 on top of the rock.

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.920
 They fitted 6,000 people.

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:40.240
 Like there's nothing else you could do,

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.720
 but just be in these apartments

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.200
 and then drill downwards to get it.

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:45.040
 And they were right, there was stuff down there.

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:46.800
 You'll recognize it by the way, possibly,

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:49.160
 if you like popular movies.

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.280
 It's in James Bond's Skyfall.

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:53.440
 It's where Bond goes to this weird island

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.040
 where it's completely abandoned.

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.000
 And so people go there now to-

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 - It means Javier Bardem.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.160
 - Yes, exactly.

00:23:59.160 --> 00:23:59.980
 - It's all, yeah, yeah.

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:01.640
 - Why was it abandoned?

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:03.320
 - Either they mined enough of it or-

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:04.640
 - No, I don't think it was that.

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:07.960
 I think that Japan switched to petrol, tragically.

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:08.800
 - Right.

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:10.880
 (all laughing)

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:12.080
 - Give it away.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:13.240
 Sorry, for that, Hannah,

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:15.040
 I've got substantial interest in coal.

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:15.880
 And-

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:16.720
 (all laughing)

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:17.800
 - We really are finding out.

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:18.640
 - Not about you.

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:20.360
 (all laughing)

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.040
 - Wait 'til you hear the gun to electric.

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:22.880
 - Oh, no.

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:24.760
 Anyway, I don't know.

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:27.720
 Japan just had a big switchover, like, yeah, yeah.

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:30.080
 - The most populated now is Mong Kok, isn't it, in Hong Kong?

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:32.640
 Just what we were talking about before, yeah, I think so.

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.840
 - That was always intensely popular in Hong Kong.

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:39.600
 - I think this island was 216,000 people per square mile,

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:41.360
 which is because it was a fraction of a square mile.

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:42.440
 - Feels like a lot, yeah.

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:43.520
 - Give us a comparison, though.

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:45.440
 What is it like in central London?

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:50.040
 - I know that the least densely populated countries

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:52.440
 are like Mongolia, which have about four people,

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:53.720
 I think, per square mile.

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:54.680
 - And this was how many?

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:56.000
 - 216,000.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:56.840
 (laughing)

00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:57.680
 - But it's-

00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:58.520
 - Quite a lot more.

00:24:58.520 --> 00:24:59.920
 - Yeah, quite a lot more, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:03.200
 - I went to an island in Japan that has all the rabbits on,

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.960
 and it's just like, you walk,

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.440
 and there's just rabbits everywhere,

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:08.680
 and you walk down, and they follow you.

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:10.080
 - Are these naturally occurring rabbits,

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:10.920
 or have they been placed there

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:12.240
 for the interest of tourists?

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:16.520
 - The story goes that there was a chemical weapons factory,

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:18.760
 and they were used as experiments,

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:22.200
 and they were let go, and then they proliferated.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:23.040
 But-

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:24.120
 - Bread like rabbits.

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:25.880
 - Well, yeah, exactly, but-

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:27.240
 - I can see why they went with the lizard

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:28.800
 for the Godzilla origin story.

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:29.880
 (laughing)

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:31.240
 - But what we think actually happened

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:32.840
 is there are a lot of school kids nearby,

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:34.720
 and they put some rabbits on there,

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:36.640
 and then the rabbits did what rabbits do,

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.440
 and became more and more and more rabbits.

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:41.160
 And now, because it's known as Rabbit Island,

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:43.680
 kids will just come and put their rabbit on there,

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:45.080
 because it's where rabbits live,

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:48.000
 and it's almost advertised as this wonderful place

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.880
 where rabbits roam free.

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:51.720
 - Sort of like your dog's gone to the farm.

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:54.400
 It's like we're just putting your rabbit on Rabbit Island.

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:55.240
 - Yeah, a little bit like that.

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:56.080
 - Are they fed?

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:58.400
 - By tourists, and that's the problem really,

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.840
 because the tourist season is quite seasonal,

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:03.120
 and so for some of the year,

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:04.240
 they don't really get fed at all.

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:05.080
 - Oh, no, okay.

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:05.920
 - Yeah, and it's-

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:08.040
 - Do you think that'll be a natural population control there,

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:08.880
 wouldn't you?

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:12.720
 - I think it is, but the population is quite high still.

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:15.920
 And you walk around, and there's a few rabbits there,

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:16.880
 and they're chasing after you,

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.760
 'cause they know the tourists feed them,

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:20.400
 and then you walk, and then you turn around,

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:21.600
 and there's a few more,

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:24.280
 and then you walk a bit further, and there's like 20.

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:25.120
 It's just scary.

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:25.960
 It's like-

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:27.400
 - It's like the birds, but rabbit.

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:28.240
 - Yeah.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.480
 - Cue animals are fine,

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:31.280
 but when they accumulate, that turns to,

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:33.120
 there's a number where it gets scary, isn't it,

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:34.800
 when you turn around and there's 40 rabbits.

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:36.600
 - For me, it's like, if there's only two,

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:38.320
 and then you turn around and there's like six,

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:39.240
 I think that's scary.

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:40.240
 - Oh, yeah.

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:43.200
 - Have you ever heard of the work of Greg Gage?

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.040
 - Greg Gage, no.

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.120
 - So this is a guy, he has this amazing stuff.

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:48.560
 He can put a device on your arm

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:50.040
 that sends little electric sensors

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:51.360
 and moves your hands for you, right?

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:52.920
 So he can sort of stand there with this thing on your arm,

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.400
 and with his iPad, he can like, move your arm.

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:56.240
 - Oh, wow.

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.080
 - Oh, that's cool.

00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:57.920
 - He created this thing,

00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:59.840
 which actually school kids around the world can do,

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:02.680
 where you can operate on a little cockroach

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:06.560
 and insert a little wire into their heads, right,

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:08.080
 and then essentially control them

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:09.360
 using a PlayStation controller.

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:10.200
 - Oh, my God.

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.160
 - Right, it's absolutely wild.

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:12.640
 Anyway, the thing is, is that, you know,

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:15.200
 you've got this remote-controlled cockroach.

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.160
 I always thought that he was missing a massive trick, though,

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:20.760
 because what he should do is get sort of gloves,

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:21.960
 which can tell where his hands are.

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:23.240
 There's, you know, those kind of gloves

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:24.480
 that are connected to it.

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:27.440
 And then have an entire army of cockroaches behind him,

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.200
 right, like a rabbit,

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.720
 and then summon them by like lifting his arms up.

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:34.880
 - Yeah, like a Marvel superhero for cockroaches.

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:35.720
 - Wow.

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.640
 - Maybe next, he can do rabbits.

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.160
 - Yeah, I'm up for it.

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:40.360
 The rabbits, I don't think, like me,

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:41.800
 'cause I accidentally kicked one.

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.160
 'Cause they were kind of, they just ran around.

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:44.480
 - Accidentally, here he is.

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.280
 - Getting his defense in first.

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:48.240
 - They just run around your feet the whole time.

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.080
 - Oh, sure, sure.

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:50.440
 - Yeah, yeah. - Wow.

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:51.280
 - That'd be a great shot.

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:53.520
 - And yet, you converted it through a rugby post

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.360
 that was nearby, and that's what's going on.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:56.720
 (all laughing)

00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:58.640
 So, I was just looking up things

00:27:58.640 --> 00:27:59.920
 that are going on in Japan at the moment.

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:00.760
 - Oh, yeah.

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:03.080
 - And have you heard of the Sushi Terror?

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:04.920
 - No, no.

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:05.920
 - Yeah, Japan is in the grip of it.

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:07.480
 Right now, as we're recording this,

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:08.840
 there's a huge problem,

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:11.120
 because there's a craze that's developed.

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:14.040
 It's an online craze, and it's spread to offline.

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:15.880
 - You know the conveyor belt sushi restaurants?

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:16.720
 - Yeah.

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:17.920
 - People have started mucking around

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:18.800
 with the stuff on the belts.

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:19.640
 - Not in Japan.

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:21.160
 - Touching the things.

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:22.000
 - What?

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.680
 - Licking bottles of soy sauce.

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:24.520
 - No. - It's very bad.

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:25.680
 I'm filming themselves as they do it,

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:29.400
 and this is obviously really bad, you know.

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:31.160
 Can you just have a little quiz for you guys?

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:32.000
 - Oh, cool, great.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.440
 - When did the first conveyor belt sushi restaurant open?

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:35.280
 What year?

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:36.640
 - 1990, in New York.

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:37.480
 - Very nice.

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.040
 Oh, at the location, very nice.

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:40.080
 - Oh, wow, okay, okay.

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:41.240
 - Wrong, though.

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:42.320
 - Look at his face. - I'm not saying

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:43.400
 until we've got all-- - Look at his face.

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:44.240
 - Oh, please, I'm very good at playing.

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:48.760
 - The first escalator came in Harrods, in the UK,

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:51.480
 around 1920s or something like that.

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:52.320
 - It's not really playing the game

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:55.320
 to use previous knowledge, but okay, I like it, yes.

00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:57.560
 - So, I'm gonna say, it was in Harrods.

00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:58.880
 They decided to open one.

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:03.160
 They took that technology, and just put little sushi on it.

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:04.560
 - Okay, and a year?

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:06.400
 - Probably 1927, I should think.

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:07.800
 - Right, Dan?

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:11.920
 - Oh, there's not much nowhere for me to go.

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:12.880
 It's not happened yet.

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:13.720
 - Brilliant.

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:15.560
 (all laughing)

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:16.960
 - 2029. - 2029.

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:17.800
 - Any day now.

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:20.600
 - Yeah, it's all an illusion, we've been had.

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:22.640
 - Well, okay, it was interesting to me.

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:24.600
 James is lobal, that's so much.

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:25.440
 - Oh, I'm sorry.

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.320
 - No, it's quite all right, but it's 1958.

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:28.600
 - Okay. - I am surprised by that.

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.160
 - That is quite a long time ago.

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:32.840
 It predates Cliff Richard's first album by a year.

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:34.680
 - And that is how we judge everything.

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:36.080
 It was Hannah, you haven't been on the show before,

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:38.160
 but that's all about it. - That's a magic shot, okay.

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:39.440
 - That is a long-- - Wow.

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:41.040
 - I'm surprised. - Yeah.

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:43.280
 - I was gonna say, I don't know if we've ever mentioned it.

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:46.360
 I don't think we have the first ever English teacher

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:49.320
 who was of a foreign country teaching English

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:53.160
 in the country was a guy called Ronald McDonald.

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:55.560
 He was the first person to teach in Japan,

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:58.000
 which would be a great, nice coincidence

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.520
 if Ronald McDonald, who is a character in McDonald's

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:03.280
 in Japan, was called Ronald McDonald, but he's not.

00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:04.680
 - What? - It's called Donald McDonald.

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:06.120
 - What, who? - What?

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:07.560
 - Yeah. - Is it 'cause the letter R

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:09.000
 is difficult to say? - Exactly.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.520
 And it's interesting looking at it online

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:11.880
 when people have written about it.

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:13.000
 There's been tweets about it.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.360
 And if you go to the replies,

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:16.400
 there's a lot of Japanese people who are like,

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:18.840
 you know, in their 30s, going, "He's called Ronald?"

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:21.640
 Like, so it's like, it's a genuinely amazing thing,

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:23.200
 but over there, he's Donald.

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.480
 - Did you say you were in Japan recently?

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:26.360
 - I was in Japan, yeah, filming.

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:27.640
 - Well, where do you-- - I was in Tokyo,

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:29.280
 but the good bit-- - Yeah.

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:32.760
 - I got to go inside the exclusion zone in Fukushima,

00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:34.240
 which was-- - Wow.

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.320
 - Wild.

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:37.760
 The whole place is extraordinary.

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:40.320
 There are these buildings, there's one sort of town hall

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:42.480
 that we went to, and the doors are locked,

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:44.800
 but inside, you can just see everybody's slippers,

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.720
 and there was like a kid's toy on the floor,

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:50.920
 and then, you know, like, beer bottles, right?

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:52.520
 They'd had a party or something the night before,

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:54.560
 and there's like a crate with sort of the empties

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:55.840
 that they hadn't got rid of. - Wow, yeah.

00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:58.160
 - And just like, everybody left in such a rush

00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:59.600
 'cause of the tsunami.

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:01.560
 But one of the reasons why we were going there,

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:04.480
 we were looking at wildlife and how wildlife has changed,

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:06.320
 and there were reports before we got there

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:10.040
 that there were radioactive bears inside the exclusion zone,

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:11.440
 which I was obviously very excited about.

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:12.280
 - Yeah.

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:13.880
 - So we got there, we started, right,

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:15.360
 we're literally on a bear hunt.

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:17.160
 (all laughing)

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:18.680
 - And we asked good.

00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:21.760
 - Yeah, so many of the radiation, but you know, whatever.

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:23.240
 Anyway, we went to talk to a sexist and we're like,

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:24.440
 "Okay, tell us about these bears."

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:26.080
 And, you know, we couldn't find any bears.

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:28.320
 So, "Okay, so how much have you seen these bears?"

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:30.720
 And then it transpired that actually,

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:35.720
 the bear researcher themselves had only seen one bear once.

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:38.440
 - Right, okay.

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:40.040
 Actually, there wasn't radioactive bears at all.

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:42.880
 It was radioactive bear, which may or may not be there.

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:43.720
 - Wow.

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:44.560
 - Yeah.

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:45.600
 - I'd love to find that bear.

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:46.600
 That sounds amazing.

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:47.440
 The radioactive bear.

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:49.520
 - I'm not as strongly suspected as a boar,

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:51.320
 just, you know, on a spiny angle.

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:52.160
 - Just a spiny angle.

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:53.000
 - Oh, yeah.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.220
 (all laughing)

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:56.800
 (upbeat music)

00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:01.800
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:03.200
 and that is James.

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:06.200
 - Okay, my fact this week is that if you grew up in a city,

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:08.240
 then you have a worse sense of direction

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:10.640
 than someone born in the countryside.

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:13.400
 Though it doesn't seem to work if you're from Hungary.

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:14.720
 - Hmm.

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:17.040
 - Okay, again, we're gonna need more data.

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:21.360
 - So this is a study published last year in Nature,

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:23.520
 and it assessed the navigational skills

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:26.520
 of 400,000 people across 38 countries.

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:27.800
 And what they did was they asked people

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:30.120
 to memorize a map in a video game.

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:31.920
 And then once they memorized it,

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:34.760
 they got them to get their characters to go through this map.

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:37.560
 And they worked out how good everyone wasn't navigating.

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:39.120
 And they found that it was very clear

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:42.040
 that people who grew up in cities

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:44.400
 tended to have a worse sense of direction.

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:46.960
 People who were in the countryside had a better,

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:49.360
 and people in the suburbs were always in between the two.

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:51.000
 So it was a real good correlation.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.600
 And they said it was strong in places

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:54.880
 like Argentina, the UK, and the US.

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:57.040
 But there were countries like Hungary, for example,

00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:59.400
 this is a quote, where there was no real difference,

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:02.000
 but on average, the trend held.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.840
 - So is that because Hungary has very simple cities

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:07.240
 or complicated countryside?

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:10.120
 - I've been to Hungary, and for instance, in Budapest,

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:11.720
 I would say it's not that different to London,

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:14.280
 'cause it's an old, very old city that's built up.

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:15.400
 - It's Higley-de-Pigley-D.

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:18.720
 - Yeah, not like New York, which is in a grid.

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:20.640
 - And that's why they said people with a worse sense

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:22.880
 of direction were people who grew up in grid cities.

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:24.080
 - They tend to be the worst.

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:26.360
 - Yeah, I mean, well, that makes sense, right?

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:28.280
 - And they kind of speculate slightly

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:31.120
 that you don't have as much signpost telling you

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:32.960
 which way to go and that kind of stuff.

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:33.880
 - It's pretty amazing.

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:36.080
 So the game that was created for them to do this

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:37.960
 is called, whoops, sorry.

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:38.800
 - Is it Quest?

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.120
 - It is, it's Sea Hero Quest.

00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:41.680
 - Okay, I need to tell you about, go on, keep going.

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:42.520
 - Oh, do you know it?

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:43.360
 - Yes, keep going.

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:45.880
 - So this game, as of April 22nd, 2022,

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:49.280
 has been now played by over 4.3 million players,

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:51.240
 not necessarily all for this exact thing

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:52.520
 that you're talking about, James.

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:54.760
 It's just an incredible way of gathering data.

00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:58.280
 - Is this a particular thing that's used in science too?

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.920
 - Yeah, it's like this amazing kind of game

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:02.160
 that is fun to play,

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:04.120
 but then you're also collecting data from it.

00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:07.000
 But the reason why I love it so much is that,

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.200
 okay, so there are particular cells in your brain

00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:12.360
 that help you with navigation,

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:14.960
 and they found these in mice and rats.

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:17.040
 So some of them are called play cells,

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:18.520
 and essentially what happens, right?

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:22.240
 Let's say you put a rat in a rectangular room, okay?

00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:26.120
 You can put a kind of cute little hat on the rat

00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:27.920
 that will measure what's going on in the brain,

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:31.320
 and you can work out when particular neurons are firing.

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:33.280
 And it turns out that in, let's say,

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:34.760
 the northeast corner of the room,

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:37.520
 if there's one neuron that fires in this rat's brain

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:39.840
 while it's in that location,

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:41.360
 it will not fire anywhere else.

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:44.320
 It's like a specific neuron that is like,

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.600
 this is the northeast corner, a play cell.

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:49.960
 And actually what you can do is you can elongate

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:51.800
 the zone in which that neuron fires

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.800
 by putting a rat into an identical room

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:56.000
 that is just stretched out longer.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.400
 So it's like the northeast corner becomes bigger,

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:01.280
 and so where this neuron fires also becomes bigger.

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:02.920
 Anyway, the thing is, is that they have to do this

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:04.840
 while the rats are going around in little rooms,

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:08.560
 but it's quite hard to hook up this rat to the hat

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:10.080
 that's measuring what's going on in their brain.

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:12.080
 - You're not gonna put a spike in it like the cockroach.

00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:12.920
 Are you?

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:16.200
 'Cause I was a bit squeamish about that, and I was like...

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:18.320
 - It's only tiny, the cockroach is fine.

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:19.240
 The cockroach is fine.

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:20.160
 - Okay, okay.

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:23.440
 - No, so what they do is they put the little hat on the rat,

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:25.560
 and then they put the rat on a ball,

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:27.520
 and then the rat can run around,

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:28.720
 and the ball moves underneath them

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:29.840
 as though they're running freely,

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:31.760
 and then they put it in front of a computer

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:32.920
 and get it to play Quest.

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:33.760
 - No.

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:34.600
 - Yeah.

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:35.440
 - Wow.

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:36.400
 - Yeah, so the rat's like running around

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.360
 playing this computer game.

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:38.200
 - Oh my God.

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:39.920
 - It's almost like VR for the rat, right?

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:40.760
 - Totally.

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:42.160
 - It thinks that it's in this well that I get,

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:43.000
 I don't know.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:43.840
 - Totally.

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:44.680
 - Probably doesn't even know it's a rat,

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:46.800
 but it's like, you know, it's like,

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.880
 it imagines that it's actually going round, right?

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:49.720
 - Yeah, and it's the screen,

00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:52.000
 it's like a little rat-sized IMAX.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:52.840
 - Amazing.

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:53.680
 - That's amazing.

00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:55.240
 - Well, one more thing about this study,

00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:56.720
 and why it might be important,

00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:58.520
 is because poor navigation skills

00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:01.680
 are sometimes used to help identify dementia in people,

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:04.160
 and so you need to know what your base level

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:07.320
 of navigation skills would be for a normal person.

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:09.520
 So if you live in the city or the countryside,

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:11.160
 and you have poor navigation skills,

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:12.360
 it could be 'cause you have dementia,

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:14.720
 but you need to know what your original was.

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:15.960
 - See, that's clever.

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.800
 I read that if you follow Google Maps,

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:18.960
 if you follow the blue line,

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:21.320
 your sense of direction gets much worse over time.

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:22.920
 - Yeah, well, it's like your brain's like a muscle, right?

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:23.840
 You've got to practice it.

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:24.680
 - So I turned it off yesterday.

00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:25.520
 I turned off the blue line.

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:26.360
 I had to get somewhere,

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:27.760
 had to walk for about half an hour across London,

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:29.040
 and I turned it off,

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:31.720
 and it was only about three corners in the whole journey,

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:32.560
 so it was really--

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:33.720
 - Well, it's the blue line.

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:34.560
 Sorry.

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:35.400
 - On Google Maps, you know, there's a blue line,

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:37.440
 you put it in directions to somewhere,

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:38.600
 it gives you a little blue line.

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:39.440
 - Right.

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:40.280
 - You follow that line,

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:41.120
 and then you get to the place you're going.

00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:41.960
 - Okay.

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:45.280
 I got lost on the way between Holborn and Cronk Garden just now.

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:46.920
 I mean, that's what I'm saying, it's like.

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:48.280
 (laughing)

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:49.120
 - Amazing.

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:51.840
 - I've lived here for 20 years.

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:53.280
 I used to have an A to Z in my pocket.

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:54.800
 I used to be able to like,

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.720
 "I was fine now, I just can't do it."

00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:59.440
 You know what, there's a cabbie who I use quite a lot,

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:00.600
 and I have a game that I play with him

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:01.960
 where I'll be in a part of London,

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:05.520
 and I'll just send him a photo of a door,

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:07.080
 and it's unreal.

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:08.600
 - Sorry, you've got your own personal cabbie?

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:09.440
 - No, not my--

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:10.760
 (laughing)

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:12.560
 - We say chauffeur, normally.

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:14.840
 - You'll never have guessed who I had in this card.

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:16.840
 It was you, yeah, it was you.

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:18.000
 - No, he's not my personal cabbie.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.760
 He's like, he's a tame cabbie.

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:21.200
 (laughing)

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:22.960
 - I think that's still very impressive.

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:23.800
 Like, I've never--

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:24.620
 - Yeah?

00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:26.200
 - Like, first you give up pop noodles,

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:28.600
 and then this is the next step.

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:30.160
 - Has this cabbie feels got a spike in his head,

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:32.720
 and you just raise your hand, and he arrives.

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:35.320
 (laughing)

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:36.160
 - Wow.

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:37.440
 - Sorry, you send him photos, and he just says,

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:38.280
 "That's where you are."

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:39.120
 - Yeah, he knows.

00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:39.960
 - That's cool.

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:40.800
 - He knows the door. - That is very cool.

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:41.640
 - Do you want to try it now?

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:42.480
 Should I take a first look at the window?

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:43.320
 - Yeah.

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:44.160
 - Don't put a street sign on.

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:46.640
 - That's great, and it's just hanging out the window

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:47.880
 of our office right now.

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:49.120
 (laughing)

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:50.400
 - We could even say where we are,

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:52.320
 'cause this is the last time we're ever in this office.

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:54.160
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, so, yeah.

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:55.640
 So, let's see if he comes back with this,

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:57.080
 but we're on Maiden Lane.

00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:58.520
 Let's see if he gets Maiden Lane.

00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:00.080
 - So exciting.

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:02.440
 - It's extraordinary.

00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:03.960
 - I used to live on a street where,

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:06.840
 which was in the cabbie's knowledge exam.

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:07.680
 - Oh, yeah.

00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:08.520
 - And that was really useful,

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:09.800
 because you didn't have to give them anything.

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:10.840
 You'd just say you're on that street,

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:12.400
 and they'd be like, "Oh, yeah, we know what that is."

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:14.480
 - I did too, so I lived on Sandwich Street.

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:15.320
 - All right.

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:16.760
 - And they always do bacon lane to Sandwich Street.

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:17.600
 (laughing)

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:18.720
 - Lovely. - Great.

00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:19.560
 - What was your one?

00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:20.560
 - It was Digby Crescent,

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:22.000
 but I don't know where they would have gone to.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:22.840
 - Everard, Digby.

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:26.000
 - Everard Road to Digby Crescent, yeah.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:26.840
 Oh, he's typing.

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:27.920
 - Oh!

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:28.760
 - Okay, hold on, hold on.

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:30.400
 - That's quick.

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:32.160
 - Okay, he's too quick.

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:33.920
 I'm gonna have to edit in a space.

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:34.760
 - Exactly. - Yeah.

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:36.600
 - He says, "Is it an official test?"

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:37.440
 I think yes.

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:38.440
 - Yes. - Yes.

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:39.920
 - We revoke your license, if you.

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:41.160
 (laughing)

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:42.200
 - Well, let's do a bit of talking

00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:45.360
 and then see if he gets to give it some space.

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:46.200
 Just very quickly,

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:47.200
 you're mentioning you got lost

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:48.600
 from Holborn to Covent Garden.

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:50.760
 So I've discovered and made contact

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:52.560
 with a guy called Tristan Goole,

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:53.960
 who's an amazing guy.

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:55.800
 He writes incredible books

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:58.120
 about how you can anywhere in London

00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:00.520
 orientate yourself by various things.

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:01.360
 - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:02.320
 - If you're in the morning,

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:04.960
 go against the flow of people walking towards you

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:06.760
 because predominantly that group

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:08.280
 will be coming from a tube station.

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:09.640
 And if you need to find a tube station

00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:10.480
 at the end of the day.

00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:11.800
 - Not if you live in a commuter town.

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:13.120
 They're all going to the tube station.

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:15.520
 - Oh, sorry, this is London, central London.

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:17.080
 He's talking about it. - But you've woken up

00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:19.600
 and the kidnappers told you you're in central London

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:20.640
 but I'm not going to tell you where.

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:21.480
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:23.320
 - And you said which zone is like one or two.

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:24.720
 (laughing)

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:27.400
 - And at no point to say just ask somebody where you are.

00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:29.160
 - Well, his idea is that you shouldn't ask

00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:30.000
 someone where you are.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:30.840
 You should make the challenge

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:32.800
 of working out your navigation better.

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:34.200
 If you see a tree in London,

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:35.520
 look if it has a tilt on it.

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:37.040
 Because if it has a tilt,

00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:38.880
 that will be pointing to the south.

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:41.080
 - I always think in London go downhill,

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:42.360
 you'll get to the river eventually.

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:43.360
 - Yeah, right, okay.

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:44.200
 - I don't know if that's true.

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.040
 - It feels like it.

00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:46.560
 - I mean, they're our local maxima though.

00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:49.160
 (all laughing)

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:50.320
 - I was reading a book called

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:51.600
 The Lost Art of Finding Our Way,

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:53.960
 which is by an author called John Huff.

00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:55.840
 And he was talking about urban myths of navigation.

00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:57.920
 How, you know, there's one of,

00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:59.200
 it's not the tilt on the tree,

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:00.160
 you know the other one of the tree?

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:01.720
 - It's like moss on one side of the tree.

00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:03.120
 - Moss grows on the north side of a tree

00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:05.000
 because it's cooler, darker, shadier,

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.240
 and not on the south.

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:08.640
 And it doesn't, it only happens in mid-latitudes

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:10.000
 in the northern hemisphere.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.880
 So you need to know which hemisphere you're in.

00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:13.200
 So it's not a perfect test.

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:14.960
 - Can you flush a toilet first

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:16.360
 and see which way the water is?

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:17.200
 - Yeah, I don't know.

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:18.040
 There's a toilet next to a tree,

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:19.640
 so you do know that here.

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:20.480
 But also--

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:21.520
 - If you don't know what hemisphere you're in though,

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:22.840
 I think you're in good much more trouble.

00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:24.720
 - You can look at the stars and I'll tell you.

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:26.920
 - How long was I blindfolded for?

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:29.400
 Was it enough to do a 16-hour flight?

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:30.360
 Shall we look at the phone?

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:31.840
 - Yes, yeah.

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:32.840
 - Let's have a look, let's see.

00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:33.680
 Okay.

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:34.520
 - What's he saying?

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:35.360
 - We've got a response.

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:37.880
 Okay, we sent this at 1237

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:40.760
 and he replied at 1239, maiden name.

00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:42.200
 - Oh my God.

00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:43.720
 - I wanna know how he did it though.

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:45.280
 - What's in the photo that you can--

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:46.120
 - Can I call him and ask him?

00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:46.960
 - Yeah, go check it.

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:47.800
 - Put it on speaker.

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:49.120
 - Yeah, well.

00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:50.840
 It was the mass on the north side.

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:53.080
 (laughing)

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:56.920
 - How did you do it?

00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:58.600
 - I knew roughly where you were

00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:00.120
 because there's a safe door.

00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:01.960
 - Oh.

00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:02.800
 - Yes.

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:06.320
 - And I'm, there's no traffic in that street.

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:07.720
 So I know it's somewhere annoying

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:09.720
 like Soho or Cumbergarden.

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:11.080
 - Right.

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:15.680
 - And then I just used my pills and deductions.

00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:16.800
 - Wow.

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:18.520
 - Hi, so Richard, Dan Shriver here,

00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:19.600
 no such thing as a fish.

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:20.600
 Thanks for being on the show.

00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:23.360
 What did you, is that genuinely the final guess

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:25.240
 was a punt or did you know it?

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:28.400
 - I did recognise the street but I did use a stage door

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:30.960
 and the fact that I could tell there's no traffic

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:31.800
 in that street anymore.

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:33.080
 I'm not allowed to drive down it.

00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:36.160
 So it did look familiar and I kind of worked it out

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:37.080
 from back then.

00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:37.920
 - Amazing.

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:38.760
 - All right, cheers, Rich.

00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:39.600
 I'll talk to you later on.

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:40.440
 - Amazing.

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:41.640
 - Thanks, Benny.

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:42.920
 - Oh, I wish he ended that by going,

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:43.760
 oh, gotta go.

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:44.800
 Professor Brian Cox has called him.

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:47.120
 He's saying a picture for me to analyse.

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:49.240
 - That is really cool.

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:50.080
 - God, that's good.

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:50.920
 - Yeah.

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:51.760
 - Wow.

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:52.600
 - He's never not got one.

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:54.360
 It's one day, one day.

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:55.200
 - That's so cool.

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:59.160
 - We were talking about Holborn area

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:02.080
 and do you remember when they changed the rules

00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:03.720
 that you were allowed to stand on both sides

00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:04.560
 of the escalator?

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:05.400
 - Yeah, I do.

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:06.240
 - Holborn, yes.

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:07.080
 - It's a very long escalator.

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:07.920
 - Were you angry about it?

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:08.760
 - Yeah.

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:09.600
 - Why?

00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:10.600
 - You were incorrect the angle.

00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:11.440
 - I know, I do know.

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:12.280
 - Okay, just warning.

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:13.680
 - TFL justification for the trial.

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:14.680
 - So just to explain, sorry,

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:17.000
 in London when we go down an escalator in the underground,

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.960
 you have to stand on the right hand side

00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:21.440
 and you're allowed to walk along the left hand side.

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:23.120
 But they said from now on,

00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:25.240
 everyone's standing on both sides.

00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:26.720
 - Yeah, right.

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:28.480
 My problem with it is,

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:29.360
 I know what you're gonna say, Hannah,

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:31.040
 you're gonna say it's mathematically more efficient.

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:33.920
 You will get more people on and through the escalator

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:36.080
 if everyone's just standing.

00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:37.480
 - I will say that.

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:40.760
 - Okay, my perspective is, as a commuter,

00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:42.120
 it's less pleasant.

00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:44.640
 It's okay standing and there are people moving past you.

00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:46.560
 If you're standing with people in front behind

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:49.080
 and next to you, it's a bit of a squash.

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:49.920
 And there's this awkward thing

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:51.760
 where you might have to make conversation with someone

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:55.040
 or you'll make eye contact or they'll start a fight

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:55.880
 or they'll say, what are you doing?

00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:56.720
 - Start a fight?

00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:58.080
 (laughing)

00:42:58.080 --> 00:42:59.160
 - Just, it's too tight.

00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:01.520
 - Look, I would accept that as a response.

00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:03.760
 And I would accept that you would prefer

00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:06.240
 to have a slower journey time to avoid that.

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:08.840
 But for the fact that you're just about to slam yourself

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:10.480
 into a tube carriage

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:13.520
 with 50,000 other people into their armpits.

00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:14.360
 - Yeah.

00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:15.800
 - You know, it's definitely no more Sardini

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:17.040
 than when you get on the tube.

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:19.160
 - It feels impersonal and cold.

00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:20.920
 I love the freedom of just running up

00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:22.480
 those escalator steps and, you know,

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:24.360
 it's just, you know, you feel like you're really

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:25.200
 getting somewhere.

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:27.800
 Like, oh, these slow coaches are standing on the right.

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:28.640
 - You're just putting, yeah.

00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:29.480
 - It jumps on the right.

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:30.320
 Yeah, it jumps on the right.

00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:32.240
 The legend's on the left is what I would have to find.

00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:34.600
 (laughing)

00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:35.440
 - Do you know?

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:37.840
 Well, basically a lot of people felt the same way as you,

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:41.200
 Andy, but like Hannah says, it was successful

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:43.760
 and way more people could get down the escalator.

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:44.960
 - People don't like math, James.

00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:45.800
 People don't like math.

00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:46.640
 - Forget about the maths.

00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:47.480
 Just think about the gaps.

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:48.640
 If you were like looking down on it,

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:51.640
 say you were like, you know, in the control room.

00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:53.960
 Looking down on the escalator.

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:56.400
 If people are walking down, there's much bigger gaps,

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:57.240
 which basically means you've got

00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:58.920
 all of that wasted space, right?

00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:00.960
 So you get a much higher flux.

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:03.240
 - It's not wasted space, it's the hero's aura.

00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:06.320
 - It's, you're spotting who's a drone.

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:07.800
 Who's willing to do what the system tells them.

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:09.120
 Please stand on the escalator.

00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:09.960
 - The sheeples.

00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:10.800
 - Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:12.040
 - I like standing in the fast lane

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:13.360
 when there's no one there.

00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:15.600
 (laughing)

00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:16.920
 - But only when there's no one there.

00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:17.760
 - Only when there's no one there.

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:20.320
 Yeah, and that's because you like to play with norms.

00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:21.800
 You subvert, you twist.

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:22.640
 - Exactly.

00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:23.640
 - You kick rabbits when--

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:24.480
 - I tell you--

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:26.200
 (laughing)

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:29.120
 - Is that still in place, that law in Holburne?

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:29.960
 - Which one?

00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:31.640
 - The Tube Law.

00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:32.960
 - No, no, it was a trial.

00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:35.640
 - The double work thing and it didn't really take off.

00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:37.720
 Thanks to my letter writing campaign.

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:39.720
 - Yeah, I was gonna say, the QI offices,

00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:41.760
 we are moving and we're moving to Holburne

00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:43.720
 and it's just the sadistic bit of me

00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:46.160
 would love to know that that's now your Tube station.

00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:48.920
 - I sabotaged it by leaving small pieces of sushi

00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:51.480
 which I had licked on every other thing.

00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:54.060
 (upbeat music)

00:44:54.060 --> 00:45:00.680
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show

00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:01.840
 and that is my fact.

00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:05.520
 My fact this week is that an inventor called Yifei Chen

00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:08.680
 has designed a gun which collects tears from your face

00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:12.560
 so you can shoot them back at the person who made you cry.

00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:15.600
 - Tears, even if you're really upset,

00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:17.880
 it's not a super soka, is it?

00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:19.600
 - No, it's not, but have you seen it?

00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:20.440
 Have you seen the video of it?

00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:21.280
 - No, have I seen it?

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:23.080
 - It shoots out with more force than it ought.

00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:23.920
 - She's built it, hasn't she?

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:25.120
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:26.640
 - Like to the point where it would hurt.

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:28.240
 - We got a back track on that.

00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:31.000
 It's got similar force to a super soka

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.880
 because what it does is it collects the tears

00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:35.880
 but then there's a sort of canister that freezes it

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:37.520
 so it kind of turns.

00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:38.360
 - What?

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:39.200
 - But what does it do, Andy?

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:40.320
 'Cause it doesn't, it's still liquid.

00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:41.640
 It's not ice particles.

00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:43.520
 So it's not like, it's not tear bullets.

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:44.360
 It's still--

00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:45.440
 - Is it tear gas?

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:47.280
 (laughs)

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:48.680
 - It's kind of what it is, weirdly.

00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:50.080
 - Right, yeah.

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:53.120
 - But then at the time it takes to freeze,

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:54.760
 are you still gonna be upset at the person who made you cry?

00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:55.600
 - No, exactly.

00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:57.680
 So it's not an immediate,

00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:00.720
 I wouldn't bring it to an actual gun fight.

00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:03.240
 - Is it like, your tears are best served cold, right?

00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:04.960
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:07.360
 - And often, you know, one finds that you're actually

00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:08.800
 the one who's made yourself cry.

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:10.760
 (laughs)

00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:12.560
 You know, you have control over what you're crying

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:13.400
 in this situation.

00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:14.920
 - Andy goes home, has a little cry

00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:16.440
 and then fires about himself.

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:18.160
 (laughs)

00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:20.080
 This is all your fault.

00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:21.840
 - That's interesting that you think you have control over

00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:23.200
 whether you cry in a situation.

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:25.400
 - Yeah, I'm now thinking about my tear ducts so much.

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:26.760
 - You look like you're crying.

00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:27.600
 - I know.

00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:29.680
 - I definitely do not have control over crying.

00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:31.040
 - Very involuntary tears.

00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:31.880
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:33.880
 - I cry all the time, I try not to.

00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:35.920
 Yeah, because I'm often, I'll watch like a really,

00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:38.160
 like a really heartfelt, like Oprah Winfrey,

00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:40.400
 the YouTube clip on the Tube or on the train.

00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:41.960
 (laughs)

00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:43.400
 And it gets me every time.

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:45.160
 And it's embarrassing 'cause you have people next to you,

00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:46.000
 right?

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.160
 - So hang on, is that why you don't want this escalator thing?

00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:50.080
 So then you can have that moment of privacy.

00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:51.640
 - It's really, yeah.

00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:53.800
 The length of the Holborn escalator is about

00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:56.800
 a one classic clip of Oprah, length of time.

00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:58.280
 - So random.

00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:00.000
 - Do you watch that Tom Cruise jumping up and down

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:00.840
 on her sofa?

00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:03.160
 - No, it's not emotional, I like the emotional stuff, yeah.

00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:04.600
 - Do you like Dr. Phil?

00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:05.960
 - No, I don't watch Dr. Phil.

00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:07.800
 I like military homecoming videos

00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:09.960
 or pregnancy announcement videos.

00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:12.640
 - I quite like homecoming, yeah.

00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:13.480
 The other one I really like,

00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:16.560
 when I just want a really good cry is a dog rescue.

00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:17.400
 - Oh, nice.

00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:19.160
 - Yeah, 'cause sometimes you get the dogs

00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:20.760
 and they're in such a little state.

00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:21.600
 - Oh, I haven't done that yet.

00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:24.080
 - And you know, like, they'll often have like,

00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:26.400
 you know, loads of light and loads of like ticks

00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:28.640
 and things and horrible, you know, like scaly skin.

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:31.240
 And then what's really nice is when they patch them all up

00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:33.040
 and then they get ready to be rescued

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:34.840
 by, you know, go to an adoptive home.

00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:35.960
 They're all fluffy again.

00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:36.800
 - Oh my God.

00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:37.640
 Well, you need to-

00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:38.480
 - You do this to yourself.

00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:39.320
 - I do.

00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:40.640
 It's very therapeutic.

00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:41.480
 - This is fucking weird.

00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:42.480
 There's a Venn diagram that you,

00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:43.480
 I'd love to introduce you to,

00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:45.120
 which is military homecoming videos,

00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:46.840
 but where they come home to the dog

00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:48.520
 and the dog reacts, woof.

00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:50.720
 That's a new level of emotion.

00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:51.680
 - Whoa, there.

00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:53.160
 And you do that on the tube.

00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:54.000
 - Yeah.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.920
 - You just go on the tube and you just want to cry

00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:56.760
 when you're on the tube.

00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:58.920
 - Well, I just suddenly have a hankering to-

00:47:58.920 --> 00:47:59.840
 - It's the algorithm, you know?

00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:00.680
 I'll be watching something,

00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:01.720
 but I've watched so much of it.

00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:03.520
 I'll, you know, it'd be like a comedy clip

00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:05.160
 of someone I want to watch in an underneath.

00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:08.680
 It's like, Oprah gives $16,000 to a desperate mum

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:09.840
 who lost her house in a hurricane.

00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:11.280
 - Is this actually just to stop people

00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:12.640
 sitting next to you on the tube?

00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:15.120
 (laughing)

00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:17.880
 Andy, what do you watch to make you cry on the tube?

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:20.120
 (laughing)

00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:22.560
 - I don't think I consciously watch things

00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:24.680
 that will make me cry.

00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:25.880
 I've seen, sometimes you'll see a clip

00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:26.720
 that's doing the rounds online

00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:27.560
 and you find it moving.

00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:28.960
 - I just think about my career.

00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:31.240
 (laughing)

00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:33.840
 I would say, for me, the only thing really

00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:36.960
 that makes me a bit like that is sporting events

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:38.640
 when people, you know-

00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:40.000
 - Like a classic turnaround?

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.800
 Like a last minute Hail Mary?

00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:45.120
 - Yeah, someone who's like reached the life's ambition.

00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:45.960
 - Yeah.

00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:46.800
 - The Olympics.

00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:47.640
 - Yeah.

00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:48.480
 - Oh man, cry fest.

00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:49.320
 - A little bit.

00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:50.640
 - I'll tell you what you'll love then.

00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:51.960
 It's called the knock.

00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:53.640
 When the NFL players are told they've made it

00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:55.400
 into the Hall of Fame and someone goes around

00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:56.240
 knocking on the door.

00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:57.080
 Oh, the emotion in that.

00:48:57.080 --> 00:48:57.920
 - I think-

00:48:57.920 --> 00:48:58.760
 - Especially when there's a dog involved.

00:48:58.760 --> 00:48:59.840
 (laughing)

00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:00.680
 The puppy bowl.

00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:02.200
 - The Crufts in the Hall of Fame.

00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:04.560
 (laughing)

00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:05.640
 - Anyway, that's a-

00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:07.000
 - Gosh, we've learned a lot.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:07.840
 (laughing)

00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:08.680
 - So.

00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:09.520
 - Oh, damn.

00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:10.360
 - Yifei Chen.

00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:12.760
 So she's actually, we say inventor.

00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:16.200
 She's actually a designer and she was at a design school

00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:18.200
 and this was the thing where she grew up in Taiwan

00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:22.360
 and you're trying not to return anger towards authority,

00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:24.800
 your school teachers or your parents or so on.

00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:27.120
 I think that's just part of the culture a bit so much there.

00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:29.880
 Less so when she went overseas and she was studying

00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:31.640
 in the Netherlands and she noticed

00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:33.400
 that she was being told off

00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:35.080
 and she watched someone step up for her

00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:37.000
 but she realized she couldn't do it for herself.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.840
 So she had a cry and she thought, I felt really weak.

00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:41.960
 So I want to use my weakness and turn it into power.

00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:43.320
 What if I invented a gun?

00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:44.160
 (laughing)

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:45.000
 - Amazing.

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:45.840
 - What if I did the most punishing

00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:46.920
 and literal interpretation?

00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:48.000
 (laughing)

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:48.840
 It's very cool.

00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:49.680
 It's an amazing looking invention.

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:50.520
 - It's beautiful, yeah.

00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:54.040
 - It has these tear collecting half moons under the eyes,

00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:56.200
 and a little pipe that then leads down

00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:58.080
 into the cartridge or chamber or whatever you think.

00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:00.240
 - Yeah, and she did it as part of her course.

00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:01.480
 She designed the gun.

00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:03.880
 So on her graduation, she actually went up

00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:06.080
 and she fired the gun at the head of the department,

00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:06.920
 Shan Boli.

00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:07.840
 - I know what you're thinking.

00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:09.880
 Did I cry six tears or only five?

00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:13.120
 (laughing)

00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:14.520
 Do you feel weepy?

00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:16.840
 (laughing)

00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:19.040
 Tell you about another inventor invention or something.

00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:20.880
 - Please, please.

00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:22.720
 - Have you guys heard of the knee defender?

00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:23.680
 - No.

00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:24.600
 - I think we're about to.

00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:26.000
 - Yeah, if you're on a plane.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:26.840
 - Oh no, I know.

00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:28.120
 - You fit this to the seat in front of you,

00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:29.720
 to the back of the seat in front of you,

00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:30.680
 and it means the person in front of you

00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:31.880
 can't recline their seat.

00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:33.600
 - Oh, wow.

00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:35.480
 - And then they're banned on a lot of airlines.

00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:36.320
 - There they are.

00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:37.760
 - They're a controversial contraband thing.

00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:39.480
 And the inventor is six foot three.

00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:40.320
 (laughing)

00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:43.720
 He says that it was more to start a conversation.

00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:44.560
 - I bet it does.

00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:45.760
 (laughing)

00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:48.160
 - So it's, basically it comes with a little card

00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:49.560
 for your fellow passenger if you get one of these.

00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:52.560
 And it reads, "I realized that this may be an inconvenience.

00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:54.960
 "If so, I hope you will complain to the airline.

00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:56.760
 "Maybe working together, we can convince the airline

00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:58.120
 "to provide enough space between rows

00:50:58.120 --> 00:50:59.240
 "so people can recline their seats

00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:00.360
 "without banging into other passengers."

00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:01.680
 - What a dick.

00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:02.520
 - Yeah.

00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:03.360
 - What a dick.

00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:05.120
 - And he is, you have got some of these, haven't you?

00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:06.440
 - I'm glad to see you.

00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:08.800
 - I mean, it's like I fundamentally agree

00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:11.920
 that you, that the airlines do put them too close together

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:13.160
 and it means that actually you can't,

00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:15.360
 you have to, one person has to sacrifice their comfort

00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:16.440
 and that seems unfair.

00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:19.320
 But him being like, one of us has to sacrifice their comfort.

00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:21.280
 And this time it's not gonna be me.

00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:22.360
 - Yeah.

00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:23.880
 - And in fact, on no occasion it's gonna be me.

00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:24.720
 - No.

00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:25.560
 - Well, yeah.

00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:27.360
 - What he needs to do is fly business like I do.

00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:29.960
 And you manage to do that by eating nothing but pot noodles

00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:31.080
 and saving your money.

00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:33.480
 - If you fly first class like I do,

00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:36.440
 then you all recline and you know.

00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:38.600
 - It doesn't look so bad that sometimes I get cabs now,

00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:39.440
 does it?

00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:40.280
 (all laughing)

00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:42.000
 - I actually have my own airline pilot.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:43.040
 (all laughing)

00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:44.320
 - Take a photo of some sky.

00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:46.920
 (all laughing)

00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:50.200
 - New Jersey, isn't it?

00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:51.520
 (all laughing)

00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:52.360
 Lovely.

00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:56.240
 - We got an email in the fish inbox about,

00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:58.560
 and this is about innovation rather than about

00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:01.120
 inventions exactly, but it's just so interesting.

00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:03.880
 'Cause it was a guy called Mark Emmerton who sent in a fact

00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:06.440
 about something, a nuclear, a nuclear test.

00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:07.280
 Okay.

00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:09.800
 And he said, "I have a fact from my late great uncle

00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:12.280
 who actually worked on the nuclear test program,

00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:14.840
 the British nuclear test program in the '50s."

00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:17.240
 And he says, "This is probably classified for all I know,

00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:18.080
 but fuck it."

00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:19.960
 (all laughing)

00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:20.800
 - So.

00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:21.620
 - And a guy.

00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:22.460
 - Yeah.

00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:23.300
 Right.

00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:26.520
 The UK and US used to share test sites in the Pacific,

00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:28.040
 but each would bring their own instruments

00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:30.360
 to measure the power of nuclear tests on the ground.

00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:33.040
 The US had very sensitive state-of-the-art pressure

00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:35.400
 transducers, but they kept getting broken

00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:38.480
 or having their readings wiped by shockwaves and radiation.

00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:39.400
 Okay.

00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:41.440
 The UK, with a much smaller budget,

00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:43.440
 realized that you could measure the pressure

00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:46.400
 of a nuclear blast just by getting a squeezy tube

00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:47.280
 of toothpaste.

00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:48.600
 (all laughing)

00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:52.040
 Taking the cap off and then placing a ruler next to it,

00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:54.760
 the pressure of the blast would squirt out toothpaste

00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:56.880
 proportionally to the blast strength,

00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:59.080
 and there were no electronics to go wrong.

00:52:59.080 --> 00:52:59.920
 They worked.

00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:00.760
 - That's genius.

00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:01.600
 - Oh, that's amazing.

00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:04.520
 I mean, there is a story about this, about Fermi.

00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:05.720
 Do you know this story?

00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:08.200
 So Fermi, this amazing, amazing physicist,

00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:09.540
 and he had.

00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:10.380
 - Enrico.

00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:11.280
 - Enrico.

00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:14.240
 He had a reputation for being able to do

00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:15.880
 calculations in his head.

00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:19.440
 And during the first test, he decided he wanted

00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:22.480
 to try and work out how strong the blast was.

00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:24.320
 And so he stood in the observation tower,

00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:26.240
 which I think was some distance away from the block.

00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:27.400
 I mean, you would assume.

00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:29.240
 (all laughing)

00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:30.920
 And he tore up a tiny bit of paper,

00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:32.160
 sheet of paper into tiny little bits,

00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:33.200
 and he held it in his hand.

00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:36.640
 And then as the blast exploded, he opened his hand

00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:39.520
 and then paced out how far they'd been blown

00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:41.520
 across the room, and then got within, I think,

00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:44.240
 a factor of two of the equivalent in dynamite.

00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:46.040
 So I think, I mean, it's totally legitimate

00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:47.000
 that you can do this.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:50.320
 You don't get perfectly accurate results, weirdly enough.

00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:52.760
 But yeah, you can get really close.

00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:54.160
 - That's really cool.

00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:56.640
 - I was just on classified stuff.

00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:58.760
 I read the other day about a girl in America

00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:01.040
 who went to her school's show-and-tell

00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:04.320
 with a load of classified US government documents.

00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:06.120
 (all laughing)

00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:07.520
 - From like her dad and mom.

00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:09.160
 - No, it was even worse than that.

00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:12.080
 So there'd been, someone from the government

00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:14.800
 had been at something and then had lost their briefcase,

00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:16.080
 so I just left it there.

00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:18.800
 And their dad, this girl's dad had found it

00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:20.760
 and sort of just picked it up and looked through it

00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:22.640
 and it all said classified and stuff.

00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:23.920
 And then he just took it home

00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:25.200
 and then they kept it in the attic

00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:26.360
 and never did anything with it.

00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:28.600
 And then like five or six years later,

00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:30.200
 she was like, "I need something for show-and-tell."

00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:32.080
 Went up and then, "Oh, I'll take this."

00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:34.120
 And then took it down and it was like all stuff

00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:37.800
 about Iran and Libya and stuff like that.

00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:39.520
 - Was she detained?

00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:40.360
 - Well, yeah, she's--

00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:41.520
 - She was in Guantanamo.

00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:44.440
 (all laughing)

00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:47.240
 - The teacher got in touch with the CIA

00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:49.080
 and is that the right person or the FBI?

00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:50.120
 - Yeah, it would be the CIA.

00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:50.960
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:52.080
 And said, "We have this."

00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:55.400
 And they came and sent some people in dark glasses

00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:56.240
 to retrieve it.

00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:58.240
 - Wow, they were quietly waiting at the back of the show

00:54:58.240 --> 00:54:59.440
 and tell our blooming tillie,

00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:01.480
 talked about a conch that she's found, you know.

00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:04.800
 (all laughing)

00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:07.000
 - And I think probably the person who lost it

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.160
 might have got killed or killed.

00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:12.800
 - It was all a happy ending and that's amazing, that's so cool.

00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:13.960
 - Here's another new invention.

00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:15.520
 This is from, I think, 2022,

00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:17.880
 which I mentioned it to my wife

00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:19.320
 and she's looking into getting one.

00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:21.840
 It's a motion pillow three.

00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:23.400
 (all laughing)

00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:24.680
 - Is it a mega hanky?

00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:27.520
 (all laughing)

00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:29.360
 - It's a YouTube Prime account.

00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:33.960
 I can get rid of all those nasty ads getting in the way.

00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:34.800
 - It's a what, sorry?

00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:36.240
 - Motion pillow three, it's called.

00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:37.720
 - It's a pillow, right?

00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:39.200
 - And you have a snorer down there.

00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:40.040
 Is that where we're going?

00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:41.760
 - Ooh, I thought of it.

00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:42.600
 - Does it smother you?

00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:44.560
 (all laughing)

00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:46.120
 - Yeah, my wife is very keen on getting one.

00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:47.840
 - It's a weighted blanket for the face.

00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:49.160
 It's how it's sold, yeah.

00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:51.960
 No, is it a pillow that moves under you,

00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:54.800
 it undulates under you to keep you asleep?

00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:55.640
 - No.

00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:57.000
 - Does it massage you?

00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:57.840
 - No, that'd be nice.

00:55:57.840 --> 00:55:59.600
 - Does it do what Andy said but stop you from snoring?

00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:01.680
 - Exactly, I can't believe that you didn't build

00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:03.000
 on the snoring thing.

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.240
 What it is is when you're laying down,

00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:08.160
 if you're snoring, there are four airbags inside

00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:12.480
 and it's AI kind of generated so it inflates

00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:15.240
 to move your head around until the position

00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:16.880
 where the airwaves are opened up properly

00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:18.640
 and you stop snoring and it means

00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:19.800
 that you just reduce snoring.

00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:20.640
 - No way.

00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:22.080
 - Yeah, this is a motion pillow three.

00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:23.600
 - You're gonna say you're not waking up

00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:26.320
 when someone is, your pillow is slowly grinding

00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:27.160
 your head in the ground.

00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:28.560
 (all laughing)

00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:29.960
 - Does it make a noise?

00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:30.880
 Is there a, is there a-

00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:32.240
 - When your neck snaps it does.

00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:34.960
 (all laughing)

00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:36.840
 - It's a way to assassinate some of us then.

00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:38.160
 - Incredible.

00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:39.680
 - Is that why motion pillow one and two

00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:40.880
 didn't make it to one?

00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:43.360
 (all laughing)

00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:45.480
 - Can I tell you about the Corby trouser press?

00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:46.320
 - Yeah.

00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:47.480
 - Just while we're on game-changing inventions

00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:48.600
 of the 20th century.

00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:49.440
 - Thanks.

00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:50.280
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:52.240
 - I just, we're losing a lot of inventors now

00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:53.520
 who invented really big things.

00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:54.840
 And I'm not saying the Corby.

00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:57.240
 (all laughing)

00:56:57.240 --> 00:56:59.000
 But like the inventor of the kettle off switch,

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:00.400
 for example, is still alive.

00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:01.240
 - Oh yeah, it's still going.

00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:02.320
 - He's a professor of invention

00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:03.840
 in Oxford or something like that.

00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:05.640
 - It's called John Taylor.

00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:07.520
 This is a slight tangent or a tangent to myself,

00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:09.640
 but it's, do you know how the kettle off switch works?

00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:10.680
 - Is it a bimetallic strip?

00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:11.520
 - Yeah.

00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:12.960
 I just love bimetallic strips.

00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:13.800
 - At least the-

00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:14.640
 - What is it?

00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:15.480
 - Well that's interesting.

00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:16.520
 I haven't thought about this before.

00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:17.920
 I do remember trying to buy a kettle

00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:19.680
 which didn't have one and it was really hard.

00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:20.520
 - Really?

00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:21.880
 Why were you trying to-

00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:23.520
 - I don't remember.

00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:25.720
 But I think it was something to do with stamps

00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:28.400
 and legal activity that the post office

00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:29.240
 can't find out about.

00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:30.080
 - What?

00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:31.680
 (all laughing)

00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:34.120
 - So bimetallic strip is as it sounds,

00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:36.600
 it's a strip of two different metals

00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:38.480
 all the way along, right?

00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:42.200
 And they expand and contract at different temperatures

00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:44.360
 because of the chemical composition.

00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:47.560
 So as it gets hot water on it, the strip,

00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:49.280
 it will bend because one side

00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:51.680
 is expanding more than the other.

00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:54.160
 And you can develop those and it snaps the kettle off

00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:55.280
 at a certain temperature.

00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:56.120
 It's a bimetallic strip.

00:57:56.120 --> 00:57:58.660
 - I think that I love bimetallic strips

00:57:58.660 --> 00:58:00.800
 is the most Andy sentence I've ever heard you say.

00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:02.160
 (all laughing)

00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:03.440
 - Well, we had one in the house when I was growing up

00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:05.240
 and it was a very cool scientific experiment to do.

00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:06.080
 - What a kettle.

00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:07.440
 (all laughing)

00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:09.640
 - That's all those pot noodles you're gonna have in it.

00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:12.220
 (upbeat music)

00:58:12.220 --> 00:58:15.880
 - Okay, that's it.

00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:16.880
 That is all of our facts.

00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:18.080
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:19.920
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:21.120
 about the things that we've said

00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:22.520
 over the course of this podcast,

00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:24.120
 we can be found on our Twitter accounts.

00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:25.880
 I'm on @Sriberland, James.

00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:26.720
 - @JamesHarken.

00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:27.560
 - Andy.

00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:28.400
 - @AndrewHunterM.

00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:29.240
 - And Hannah.

00:58:29.240 --> 00:58:30.080
 - @Fryarsquad.

00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:31.960
 - Yeah, nice.

00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:33.120
 Or you can go to our group account,

00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:35.120
 which is @NoSuchThing or our website.

00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:36.720
 NoSuchThingAsAfish.com.

00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:37.560
 Check it out.

00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:38.960
 All of our previous episodes are up there

00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:40.160
 as well as merchandise.

00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:41.280
 Do have a look.

00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:44.720
 But most importantly, make sure to watch Hannah's latest show.

00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:46.120
 It's called "The Future with Hannah Fry."

00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:48.800
 It's on Bloomberg or you can find it on YouTube.

00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:51.040
 It's, the whole series is up now, right?

00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:52.840
 You can take it all in one go.

00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:54.720
 If you finish that and you're on YouTube,

00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:56.640
 why not check out some Oprah clips?

00:58:56.640 --> 00:59:00.320
 There's really good ones to watch.

00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:01.600
 Anyway, that's it.

00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:04.160
 And that's it from us, from this office.

00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:06.280
 This is where QI's office was

00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:09.200
 for the last nine years of our existence.

00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:10.920
 Fish started here nine years ago.

00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:13.920
 This is the last ever episode we're doing in our HQ.

00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:15.680
 So we'll be from somewhere new next week.

00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:18.040
 So thank you for being our final guest ever, Hannah.

00:59:18.040 --> 00:59:18.880
 - Thank you.

00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:19.720
 - In our HQ.

00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:21.880
 And yeah, we will be back again next week

00:59:21.880 --> 00:59:23.960
 in another building with another episode.

00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:24.920
 We'll see you then.

00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:25.760
 Goodbye.

00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:28.340
 (upbeat music)

00:59:28.340 --> 00:59:30.920
 (upbeat music)

00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:33.500
 (upbeat music)

00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:36.080
 (upbeat music)

00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:39.120
