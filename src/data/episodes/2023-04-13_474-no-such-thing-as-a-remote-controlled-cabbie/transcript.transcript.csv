00:00:01,00:00:04,"- Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish."
00:00:04,00:00:06,"Before we get going, I just want to let you know"
00:00:06,00:00:07,a couple of things.
00:00:07,00:00:09,"Firstly, the episode you're about to hear"
00:00:09,00:00:12,is the last ever episode to be recorded
00:00:12,00:00:14,at the QI offices in Covent Garden
00:00:14,00:00:17,as we pack up shop and move on to our new offices
00:00:17,00:00:18,in Hoburn.
00:00:18,00:00:21,"So we thought, you know, if we're gonna go out,"
00:00:21,00:00:22,we should go out strong.
00:00:22,00:00:24,So we reached out to nerd royalty
00:00:24,00:00:27,"and fortunately she said, yes, it's Hannah Fry."
00:00:27,00:00:31,"My goodness, we are such huge fans of her at the QI office."
00:00:31,00:00:33,I think every elf has probably read her books.
00:00:33,00:00:35,"Hello World, if you've not read that by the way,"
00:00:35,00:00:36,is an incredible book.
00:00:36,00:00:38,I'm sure you've all seen her TV series
00:00:38,00:00:41,which was out November of last year on BBC Two
00:00:41,00:00:43,"called The Secret Genius of Modern Life,"
00:00:43,00:00:45,was absolutely phenomenal.
00:00:45,00:00:47,"She makes incredible TV, she writes incredible books"
00:00:47,00:00:51,and she is such a good guest on this week's episode.
00:00:51,00:00:54,"You have to by the way, check out her latest show."
00:00:54,00:00:56,You can find it on bloomberg.com
00:00:56,00:00:59,and it's called The Future with Hannah Fry.
00:00:59,00:01:02,It is a look into the world of scientists and inventors
00:01:02,00:01:05,who are changing the way the world is gonna be
00:01:05,00:01:06,over the next century.
00:01:06,00:01:08,These are people who are looking into seeing
00:01:08,00:01:11,if we can live a life beyond 150 years old
00:01:11,00:01:13,who are working out whether or not computers
00:01:13,00:01:15,will be able to read our emotions
00:01:15,00:01:17,and trying to find out if they can make a planet
00:01:17,00:01:19,that will be utterly transformed
00:01:19,00:01:21,by unlimited clean energy.
00:01:21,00:01:23,"So do check that out, it's on bloomberg.com"
00:01:23,00:01:26,or you can find the entire series on YouTube as well.
00:01:26,00:01:30,"And otherwise, next time you happen to be"
00:01:30,00:01:33,"in Covent Garden, do take a walk down Maiden Lane"
00:01:33,00:01:36,and if you look above the barbershop
00:01:36,00:01:38,"that's called Ruffians, you'll see a window there."
00:01:38,00:01:39,That's where we were for nine years.
00:01:39,00:01:43,"James Andy, Anna and I just sat there dorking out"
00:01:43,00:01:44,and we're gonna miss the place
00:01:44,00:01:46,but we're looking forward to the next chapter
00:01:46,00:01:48,and that will be next week's episode.
00:01:48,00:01:50,"But for now, let's give a good old goodbye"
00:01:50,00:01:53,with Hannah Frye to the QI offices in Covent Garden
00:01:53,00:01:54,on with the show.
00:01:54,00:01:57,(upbeat music)
00:01:57,00:02:12,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:02:12,00:02:15,"of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:02:15,00:02:18,coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:02:18,00:02:19,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:02:19,00:02:21,"I'm sitting here with James Harkin,"
00:02:21,00:02:23,Andrew Hunter Murray and Hannah Frye.
00:02:23,00:02:25,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:02:25,00:02:28,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:02:28,00:02:31,"and in a particular order, here we go."
00:02:31,00:02:34,Starting with fact number one and that is Hannah.
00:02:34,00:02:37,"- Oh, me, my turn."
00:02:37,00:02:38,"Okay, here's my facts."
00:02:38,00:02:42,"The Malyard reaction, so the thing that makes your bread"
00:02:42,00:02:46,turn brown when you toast it is actually the same thing
00:02:46,00:02:48,that makes fake tan work.
00:02:49,00:02:50,Interesting.
00:02:50,00:02:51,- Okay.
00:02:51,00:02:52,"- I mean, do you want more?"
00:02:52,00:02:53,Do you want more?
00:02:53,00:02:55,"- Yeah, so you're being--"
00:02:55,00:02:56,- You're underimpressed.
00:02:56,00:02:57,- You are being toasted.
00:02:57,00:02:58,"No, it's just so weird."
00:02:58,00:03:00,"I just, I try to make the connection between"
00:03:00,00:03:02,you've been toasted effectively.
00:03:02,00:03:04,"- You would think like if you had a normal suntan,"
00:03:04,00:03:06,"you know, like you'll lay in the sun,"
00:03:06,00:03:07,you would think that's being toasted.
00:03:07,00:03:09,"- That's toasted, exactly."
00:03:09,00:03:11,"But this is a spray on or this is a cream, right?"
00:03:11,00:03:12,So there's no toasty.
00:03:12,00:03:14,- What if you put fake tan on bread?
00:03:14,00:03:14,That's what I wanted to know.
00:03:14,00:03:15,Good question.
00:03:15,00:03:16,- This is a great question.
00:03:16,00:03:17,Someone needs to experiment.
00:03:17,00:03:19,"- Yeah, perfect toast every time."
00:03:19,00:03:20,"- Okay, so the best thing about this,"
00:03:20,00:03:22,my favorite thing about this is this was discovered
00:03:22,00:03:24,completely by accident.
00:03:24,00:03:27,So there was a researcher called Ava Wittgenstein
00:03:27,00:03:30,"and she was looking into, there's some children"
00:03:30,00:03:33,"who were having problems, their bodies were having problems"
00:03:33,00:03:35,in breaking down glucose.
00:03:35,00:03:36,So there's a sort of simplified sugar
00:03:36,00:03:38,"that you find in the body,"
00:03:38,00:03:42,"which is called dihydroxyacetone, easy for me to say."
00:03:42,00:03:46,And she was seeing if you could feed them this sugar
00:03:46,00:03:47,whether their bodies could break down
00:03:47,00:03:48,that sort of simplified sugar.
00:03:48,00:03:51,"And every now and then, some of these kids"
00:03:51,00:03:52,would accidentally dribble a little bit of medicine
00:03:52,00:03:55,"down their chin and when they did,"
00:03:55,00:03:58,they would have a perfectly orange stain.
00:03:58,00:04:00,"- Wow, so funny, yeah."
00:04:00,00:04:02,"- And then she was like, what's going on here?"
00:04:02,00:04:04,And what she realized is that you have
00:04:04,00:04:06,these amino acids in the skin
00:04:06,00:04:11,"and when that reacts with the DHA, the dihydroxyacetone,"
00:04:11,00:04:14,it creates that sort of reaction
00:04:14,00:04:17,that is the same thing that ends up
00:04:17,00:04:18,"turning your skin brown in the sun,"
00:04:18,00:04:20,that is the melanin in your skin.
00:04:20,00:04:23,"Anyway, this idea was picked up by Copitone"
00:04:23,00:04:25,and then released into Faketown.
00:04:25,00:04:27,"And it's still the same thing, still the same stuff,"
00:04:27,00:04:29,"the DHA, which is, I think."
00:04:29,00:04:31,"But they've just, they've become much better"
00:04:31,00:04:33,at making it less smelly and less orange.
00:04:33,00:04:37,"- So did Ava Wittgenstein, did she see this little bit"
00:04:37,00:04:41,"of orange-ness and think, what if that was my whole face?"
00:04:41,00:04:42,Or she's more of a scientist
00:04:42,00:04:44,than someone else picked up on the idea?
00:04:44,00:04:45,- She's more of the scientist.
00:04:45,00:04:47,"I mean, look, who doesn't want to have"
00:04:47,00:04:48,an entirely orange face?
00:04:48,00:04:49,(laughing)
00:04:49,00:04:51,I'm sure she had ambition.
00:04:51,00:04:52,- But here's the question that I've got.
00:04:52,00:04:55,"I spent ages, hours, trying to find anything"
00:04:55,00:04:57,about Ava Wittgenstein.
00:04:57,00:04:59,There is nothing that I could find.
00:04:59,00:05:00,- Were you trying to find out
00:05:00,00:05:02,if she was related to Ludwig?
00:05:02,00:05:04,"- No, I don't know, no, 'cause I did."
00:05:04,00:05:05,"Right, and did you find anything?"
00:05:05,00:05:07,"No, exactly, there's nothing about,"
00:05:07,00:05:09,so she does this in the '50s
00:05:09,00:05:10,and then she kind of disappears.
00:05:10,00:05:12,And I asked a friend who knows how to go
00:05:12,00:05:14,into sort of American records
00:05:14,00:05:16,just to see if he could find her.
00:05:16,00:05:17,And he searched the whole records.
00:05:17,00:05:19,All he could find was an Ava Wittgenstein
00:05:19,00:05:22,who died age 97 in North Carolina.
00:05:22,00:05:23,"We don't know if it's her,"
00:05:23,00:05:25,but she showed up as being on a government watch list.
00:05:25,00:05:26,- Oh!
00:05:26,00:05:30,"- So it's kind of a cool idea that maybe Ava became, yeah."
00:05:30,00:05:31,"- Hey, maybe she became a spy"
00:05:31,00:05:35,and could like change her disguise for going orange
00:05:35,00:05:36,and then back to white.
00:05:36,00:05:37,"- That's the original mission impossible, isn't it?"
00:05:37,00:05:39,- She runs into a tanning booth and comes out.
00:05:39,00:05:41,"- Half an hour later, completely unrecognizable."
00:05:41,00:05:43,"- What a disguise, yeah."
00:05:43,00:05:46,So have any of you guys ever been faked-hanned?
00:05:46,00:05:47,- No. - At all?
00:05:47,00:05:47,- No. - I'm nervous.
00:05:47,00:05:48,- Almost non-stop.
00:05:48,00:05:50,(laughing)
00:05:50,00:05:51,I'm not joking.
00:05:51,00:05:53,"Do you, like, my skin is, okay,"
00:05:53,00:05:55,it's important for anybody who doesn't know what I look like.
00:05:55,00:05:58,I am the most ginger person that a ginger person can be.
00:05:58,00:06:00,"Right, like, I am fully ginger,"
00:06:00,00:06:02,"which means that my skin is not just white,"
00:06:02,00:06:04,it's like translucent with a hint of blue.
00:06:04,00:06:08,"And so, I put on faked-hanned"
00:06:08,00:06:11,just to make my skin look like pasty skin.
00:06:11,00:06:12,- Wow.
00:06:12,00:06:13,Do you have it on right now?
00:06:13,00:06:14,"- I don't, actually."
00:06:14,00:06:16,"But I have got bronzer on, can you not tell?"
00:06:16,00:06:19,"- Well, you just, your skin looks fine, it looks normal."
00:06:19,00:06:20,"- Interesting though, that's, okay,"
00:06:20,00:06:23,but you can be kind of under pale.
00:06:23,00:06:25,"Like, you're not even pale."
00:06:25,00:06:28,"- No, I aspire to be pale."
00:06:28,00:06:29,"- So have you tried that,"
00:06:29,00:06:30,'cause I know there are loads of different methods
00:06:30,00:06:31,"that you can do, there are the beds on there"
00:06:31,00:06:32,and then there are the booths.
00:06:32,00:06:35,"- Oh, no, so beds are not faked-hanned."
00:06:35,00:06:37,"So the beds, you go in, that's a real tan."
00:06:37,00:06:40,"- That's very, it's looked down on."
00:06:40,00:06:42,"- Oh, okay, it's not very good for you, yeah."
00:06:42,00:06:44,- It's a little bit skin-cancery.
00:06:44,00:06:46,"- Right, so I didn't realize that these,"
00:06:46,00:06:49,"the spray that you can put on, is also a risk."
00:06:49,00:06:50,- Is it?
00:06:50,00:06:52,"- Because, well, no, I mean, not, sorry."
00:06:52,00:06:54,"Okay, just for any big tanners listening"
00:06:54,00:06:56,"or sort of like legal teams, whatever."
00:06:56,00:06:59,"Point is that I, what a backtrack."
00:06:59,00:07:02,- Big tan might be coming to get you.
00:07:02,00:07:03,- It's actually good for you.
00:07:03,00:07:06,"It's actually, no, it makes you look like"
00:07:06,00:07:08,"you are protected from the sun, but you're not."
00:07:08,00:07:09,- I see.
00:07:09,00:07:10,- It hasn't had the actual effect.
00:07:10,00:07:12,"It's reacted, it's produced these pigments,"
00:07:12,00:07:14,"these melanoidins in your skin,"
00:07:14,00:07:17,but you are then totally unprotected from sun.
00:07:17,00:07:19,"- So some people would think you,"
00:07:19,00:07:20,"and I don't think this is even proper,"
00:07:20,00:07:22,but some people think you get a little bit of a tan
00:07:22,00:07:25,"and that will protect you from other, you know, stronger."
00:07:25,00:07:27,"- From the sun, yeah, yeah, yeah, which it doesn't."
00:07:27,00:07:29,"- This definitely doesn't, this is just, yeah."
00:07:29,00:07:31,"- And doesn't it, this is a bit sciency for me,"
00:07:31,00:07:34,"but doesn't it in, sorry, doesn't it actually kind of"
00:07:34,00:07:38,make you more susceptible to having the sun's harm you?
00:07:38,00:07:42,"- Don't know, I haven't got any research on that."
00:07:42,00:07:44,"- I mean, I think no, I think no."
00:07:44,00:07:47,"- Okay, there was a study that was done in 2007,"
00:07:47,00:07:49,"which showed, and this was by Katinka Jung."
00:07:49,00:07:51,I don't know if there's any relation to Carl.
00:07:51,00:07:52,(laughing)
00:07:52,00:07:55,"I don't know if it consigned the situation, yeah."
00:07:55,00:07:57,"This was in Berlin, which showed that 24 hours after"
00:07:57,00:08:00,"having the tan are on, ultraviolet,"
00:08:00,00:08:02,you become more susceptible to it in a 24 hour period.
00:08:02,00:08:04,- According to this study in 2002 or so.
00:08:04,00:08:07,"- Interesting, look, all I know is I never leave"
00:08:07,00:08:09,the Blumen House without fact 50 on.
00:08:09,00:08:12,"I was once, oh, oh, oh, oh, God, yeah."
00:08:12,00:08:15,"So I was once in Cuba, don't like to brag."
00:08:15,00:08:19,"I was wearing fact 50 and sat in the shade all day,"
00:08:19,00:08:22,and I was burnt so badly from the reflection of the sun
00:08:22,00:08:25,"on the sand, but I got blisters, right?"
00:08:25,00:08:27,That's the sort of situation.
00:08:27,00:08:29,"You people without ginger hair, you don't know,"
00:08:29,00:08:30,you don't know that how we suffer.
00:08:30,00:08:32,"- I do have transparent skin as well,"
00:08:32,00:08:35,"actually, I like Irish skin, even though I have dark hair."
00:08:35,00:08:38,"Like, when I was in a similar part of the world,"
00:08:38,00:08:41,"I put sun cream on, back to 50, every 20 minutes,"
00:08:41,00:08:43,"and one of the times I didn't put it on properly,"
00:08:43,00:08:47,and I blistered in the shape of a handprint on my chest.
00:08:47,00:08:49,"- Oh, God. - Yeah."
00:08:49,00:08:52,- I went to a pig farm in Scotland recently.
00:08:52,00:08:53,(laughing)
00:08:53,00:08:55,"- Guys, all these show bizangos that we've got coming."
00:08:55,00:08:56,"- Again, again, don't like to brag."
00:08:56,00:08:58,(laughing)
00:08:58,00:08:59,- What I hope you're gonna say is you realize
00:08:59,00:09:03,"that pigs shelter from the sun by rubbing themselves in mud,"
00:09:03,00:09:04,and you did the same?
00:09:04,00:09:05,(laughing)
00:09:05,00:09:07,"- I mean, close, close."
00:09:07,00:09:09,"It's because you said Irish skin,"
00:09:09,00:09:11,"and when I was going around this pig farm,"
00:09:11,00:09:13,"I realized just, I mean, genuinely,"
00:09:13,00:09:15,these pigs have identical skin to me.
00:09:15,00:09:17,(laughing)
00:09:17,00:09:18,Identical skin.
00:09:18,00:09:20,"And I was like, why do all these pigs have Irish skin?"
00:09:20,00:09:24,"And as you say, it makes them really susceptible to sunburn."
00:09:24,00:09:26,So that's why they have to keep them in sheds.
00:09:26,00:09:28,"But actually, the reason for having Irish skin"
00:09:28,00:09:32,"as a bit grim is because when you are breeding them for meat,"
00:09:32,00:09:35,you can see if there's bad meat much easier
00:09:35,00:09:36,through see-through skin.
00:09:36,00:09:37,- No. - Wow.
00:09:37,00:09:39,- What? - Is that true?
00:09:39,00:09:40,- That is super fussing.
00:09:40,00:09:43,"- So look, you and me, if we ever get hung up for meat."
00:09:43,00:09:44,- Yeah. - Wow.
00:09:44,00:09:47,- Do you both have any advantage to having pale skin?
00:09:47,00:09:48,Can anyone see something?
00:09:48,00:09:50,- We are vitamin D superheroes.
00:09:50,00:09:51,"- Okay, right."
00:09:51,00:09:54,"- Like, that's genuinely a superpower of pale skin people."
00:09:54,00:09:55,- What does that mean?
00:09:55,00:09:56,"- We make it. - Like, we synthesize it"
00:09:56,00:09:57,more easily. - Yeah.
00:09:57,00:09:59,- So great. - Not enough that you can come in
00:09:59,00:10:00,"and, you know-- - Extract it for me."
00:10:00,00:10:01,"- Extract it for me. - No, no, no."
00:10:01,00:10:04,- Can't make a vitamin D farm out of us.
00:10:04,00:10:06,"- We haven't tried yet, though."
00:10:06,00:10:08,"- I read an article that said,"
00:10:08,00:10:11,"""The Maillard reaction is by far"
00:10:11,00:10:14,"""the most widely-practiced chemical reaction in the world."""
00:10:14,00:10:16,"- Hmm, that's so cool."
00:10:16,00:10:17,"- Well, hang on, what about breathing?"
00:10:17,00:10:21,"- Breathing us, that counts as a chemical reaction, yeah."
00:10:21,00:10:23,"Well, this was at the 100-year anniversary"
00:10:23,00:10:25,of the Maillard reaction. - Right.
00:10:25,00:10:28,- Which is a huge thing. - They got skin in the game.
00:10:28,00:10:30,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:10:30,00:10:31,And it was a chemist who said it.
00:10:31,00:10:35,"Nobel Prize winner, Jean-Marie Lane, who said it."
00:10:35,00:10:36,But there was a huge conference.
00:10:36,00:10:39,It was like 100 years since it got discovered.
00:10:39,00:10:41,"And there's a group, the Maillard reaction group."
00:10:41,00:10:44,- The Maillard reaction society have conferences
00:10:44,00:10:46,just about the Maillard reaction.
00:10:46,00:10:48,"Yeah, as you say, James, they were established in 2005"
00:10:48,00:10:52,and it's just food-browning scientists meeting up and--
00:10:52,00:10:53,- Sounds great.
00:10:53,00:10:55,"- I think a while of the time, I bet."
00:10:55,00:10:57,"But actually, I think James's case"
00:10:57,00:10:59,said it's the most practiced chemical reaction on the planet.
00:10:59,00:11:01,"- Well, this was Jean-Marie Lane who said this."
00:11:01,00:11:03,"- I'm supporting it, James, because not only"
00:11:03,00:11:05,"is everyone who's ever made a slice of toast engaged in it,"
00:11:05,00:11:07,but also the Maillard reaction is happening
00:11:07,00:11:09,in our bodies all the time.
00:11:09,00:11:10,"And so when you toast something,"
00:11:10,00:11:12,it happens at a very high temperature.
00:11:12,00:11:17,"But generally, it's a reaction between amino acids,"
00:11:17,00:11:20,"which are the building blocks of proteins,"
00:11:20,00:11:22,"we've all made lots of proteins, and sugars."
00:11:22,00:11:24,So that is constantly happening
00:11:24,00:11:27,"in the human body anyway, but at a very slow rate,"
00:11:27,00:11:29,"much, much more slowly than toasting"
00:11:29,00:11:31,or the faked anything.
00:11:31,00:11:33,"- Are you saying I'm orange on the inside, too?"
00:11:33,00:11:34,- I'm afraid so.
00:11:34,00:11:36,(laughing)
00:11:36,00:11:39,"And it's bad for you, though, 'cause when you make toast,"
00:11:39,00:11:41,"the Maillard reaction produces about 1,000 new molecules,"
00:11:41,00:11:43,"you know, it's really complicated."
00:11:43,00:11:46,- One of the chemicals it makes is acrylamide.
00:11:46,00:11:48,And acrylamide is carcinogenic.
00:11:48,00:11:51,"You know, if you have just a slice of toast every day,"
00:11:51,00:11:53,it's not nearly enough to be a problem.
00:11:53,00:11:56,But they found that the Maillard process
00:11:56,00:11:58,"that they use in highly processed foods,"
00:11:58,00:12:01,so if you're making some really highly processed food
00:12:01,00:12:02,"and you want it to last for ages,"
00:12:02,00:12:04,"one way to do it is to heat it up really, really quickly"
00:12:04,00:12:06,"at a massive, massive temperature."
00:12:06,00:12:08,And that kind of Maillard reaction
00:12:08,00:12:10,gives this acrylamide.
00:12:10,00:12:10,- Yeah.
00:12:10,00:12:12,"- You know, talk about processed foods, though."
00:12:12,00:12:14,"So, okay, if you're like home cooking"
00:12:14,00:12:17,and you're browning off the chicken
00:12:17,00:12:18,and then browning off this thing
00:12:18,00:12:19,"to try and get loads of flavor,"
00:12:19,00:12:21,"something I've discovered recently,"
00:12:21,00:12:22,"don't bother doing any of that, right?"
00:12:22,00:12:25,"You can get MSG from the internet, right?"
00:12:25,00:12:26,"Buy it, right?"
00:12:26,00:12:29,"Little sprinkle of MSG, it makes everything taste amazing."
00:12:29,00:12:33,"And because I am a scientific in nature, right?"
00:12:33,00:12:34,I've A/B tested this stuff with guests
00:12:34,00:12:35,coming around my house.
00:12:35,00:12:36,"- Oh, right."
00:12:36,00:12:37,"- Sorry, what's A/B testing?"
00:12:37,00:12:39,"- It's where you basically have one bowl with,"
00:12:39,00:12:41,"one bowl without, and see which one goes down quicker."
00:12:41,00:12:43,- Oh. - That's interesting.
00:12:43,00:12:43,"- Yeah. - Oh, wow."
00:12:43,00:12:45,- Did they know they were in an experiment
00:12:45,00:12:46,when they came around?
00:12:46,00:12:49,- They did not tell me to come to my house.
00:12:49,00:12:50,- I would say it's an assumption.
00:12:50,00:12:51,"If you ever go and visit Hannah,"
00:12:51,00:12:53,it's like you're probably in an experiment.
00:12:53,00:12:55,"- You sign this release form at the door,"
00:12:55,00:12:56,"and it's not really explained,"
00:12:56,00:12:58,"but it's, what was in the bowls?"
00:12:58,00:12:59,Do you mind me asking?
00:12:59,00:13:01,- I made a chicken curry.
00:13:01,00:13:02,"Look, don't get me wrong,"
00:13:02,00:13:04,my chicken curry is absolutely delicious.
00:13:04,00:13:05,(all laughing)
00:13:05,00:13:07,Both bowls were finished eventually.
00:13:07,00:13:08,- But the one with the Kraken.
00:13:08,00:13:13,"- The one with the Kraken was more enjoyed, yeah."
00:13:13,00:13:15,"- Well, I mean, MSG's my, I grew up in Hong Kong,"
00:13:15,00:13:16,"that's my life, MSG."
00:13:16,00:13:17,I'm very excited about that.
00:13:17,00:13:19,- Do you have buckets of it that you like spoon from?
00:13:19,00:13:21,- I do get pot noodle and I collect
00:13:21,00:13:24,just the sachets so that I can use it on other things.
00:13:24,00:13:26,- Are those sachets of MSG that come with pot noodles?
00:13:26,00:13:29,"- You know, MSG is inside the actual powder"
00:13:29,00:13:30,that you get of the actually--
00:13:30,00:13:31,- I didn't know that.
00:13:31,00:13:33,"- I can't remember when I last had a pot noodle,"
00:13:33,00:13:34,but it's been a while.
00:13:34,00:13:35,- Yeah.
00:13:35,00:13:37,"- Some of us like, move faster than others."
00:13:37,00:13:39,(all laughing)
00:13:39,00:13:41,"- This is my version of, I was in Cuba recently,"
00:13:41,00:13:43,it's the start of my pot noodle in the last few years.
00:13:43,00:13:45,(all laughing)
00:13:45,00:13:48,"- Can I tell you something about airline food,"
00:13:48,00:13:50,specifically relating to--
00:13:50,00:13:50,- Yeah.
00:13:50,00:13:55,- You can't do the Maillard reaction on a plane.
00:13:55,00:13:57,- Okay. - That's interesting.
00:13:57,00:14:00,"- Most planes these days don't have stoves, right?"
00:14:00,00:14:01,"- Well, you need an open flame, also."
00:14:01,00:14:01,"- Oh, hang on."
00:14:01,00:14:03,"- An open flame. - Sure, sure."
00:14:03,00:14:05,"- So, how do they heat the food, the microwave it?"
00:14:05,00:14:06,"- Yeah, okay."
00:14:06,00:14:07,- What's the maximum temperature
00:14:07,00:14:09,microwaveable food gets up to?
00:14:09,00:14:12,"It's 100 degrees because it's heating the water molecules,"
00:14:12,00:14:13,"which get to 100, blah, blah, blah."
00:14:13,00:14:16,"So, you can't, that's part of the reason"
00:14:16,00:14:17,why plane food tastes bad.
00:14:17,00:14:19,I know it affects your taste buds big down.
00:14:19,00:14:20,- If I brought a Bunsen burner
00:14:20,00:14:23,"onto a plane, it would be possible."
00:14:23,00:14:24,"- Yeah, unfortunately,"
00:14:24,00:14:26,it's actually on that little card at check-in.
00:14:26,00:14:28,"They do say, ""Have you brought a Bunsen burner"
00:14:28,00:14:29,"""for your toast?"""
00:14:29,00:14:31,There's a picture of a guy with a medieval toasting fork
00:14:31,00:14:32,"as well. - Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:14:32,00:14:33,- Really strict.
00:14:33,00:14:34,"- But, no, if you put it on those little plastic bags,"
00:14:34,00:14:35,you can get that through.
00:14:35,00:14:36,"- Oh, yeah, sure."
00:14:36,00:14:37,(all laughing)
00:14:37,00:14:39,"- Yeah, but lots of food is pre-Maillard-ed"
00:14:39,00:14:41,before it's loaded onto the plane.
00:14:41,00:14:42,- And then microwaved.
00:14:42,00:14:43,"- And then it's microwaved,"
00:14:43,00:14:46,"and then you get a bit of the flavor still, but yeah."
00:14:46,00:14:50,- The Maillard reaction works on poo.
00:14:50,00:14:52,"And that's why we have,"
00:14:52,00:14:54,that's why we have coprolites.
00:14:54,00:14:55,- Oh. - Yeah.
00:14:55,00:14:56,- What a coprolite.
00:14:56,00:14:58,"- So, a coprolite is a fossilized poo."
00:14:58,00:14:59,- Right.
00:14:59,00:15:00,- Our listeners will know that.
00:15:00,00:15:01,(all laughing)
00:15:01,00:15:03,"- Of course they will, don't call us."
00:15:03,00:15:06,"- But basically, let's say you have a dinosaur,"
00:15:06,00:15:07,they do a poo.
00:15:07,00:15:09,The Maillard reaction works on the surface of the poo.
00:15:09,00:15:11,That's what crusts it over.
00:15:11,00:15:12,"And then eventually,"
00:15:12,00:15:14,that's what helps it become a coprolite.
00:15:14,00:15:15,"- Wow, cool."
00:15:15,00:15:17,"- So if I take my dog out for a walk,"
00:15:17,00:15:20,spray the result with fake tan.
00:15:20,00:15:21,- Yeah.
00:15:21,00:15:23,Sprinkle a little MSG on it.
00:15:23,00:15:25,(all laughing)
00:15:25,00:15:28,"- Come back millions of years later, there's a chance."
00:15:28,00:15:30,"- Leave a sign near it, do not touch."
00:15:30,00:15:31,Experiment in progress.
00:15:31,00:15:32,One of Hamlet's experiments.
00:15:32,00:15:33,- Yeah.
00:15:33,00:15:34,"- Oh, fuck it."
00:15:34,00:15:35,"- Let's leave it alone, all right?"
00:15:35,00:15:36,Don't you said Hong Kong?
00:15:36,00:15:37,'Cause we were talking about MSG.
00:15:37,00:15:38,"- Oh, yeah, yeah."
00:15:38,00:15:39,- Have you heard of Wok Hei?
00:15:39,00:15:40,Is this familiar?
00:15:40,00:15:42,"- Wok Hei. - Wok Hei, yeah."
00:15:42,00:15:44,"It's the breath of the wok, right?"
00:15:44,00:15:48,"- Oh, it's the quality that if you're cooking in China"
00:15:48,00:15:49,"and particularly in Hong Kong,"
00:15:49,00:15:53,it's the perfect seared taste of the rice
00:15:53,00:15:54,that's been cooked in a wok.
00:15:54,00:15:57,"And it's because the rice gets tossed really fast,"
00:15:57,00:15:59,"loads of times, a few times a second."
00:15:59,00:16:00,It uses the mild reaction.
00:16:00,00:16:04,And if you get the trajectory of the rice right
00:16:04,00:16:05,"and it's cooking at the right temperature,"
00:16:05,00:16:07,"it's absolutely delicious, apparently."
00:16:07,00:16:09,"And there's a restaurant called The Chairman in Hong Kong,"
00:16:09,00:16:12,which is one of the top restaurants in Hong Kong.
00:16:12,00:16:14,And chefs there have to spend a year practicing
00:16:14,00:16:16,the tossing of the rice in the pan.
00:16:16,00:16:18,They're only allowed to cook for other chefs.
00:16:18,00:16:20,They're not allowed to cook stir-fry for customers.
00:16:20,00:16:22,They're not allowed to cook a stir-fry for a year
00:16:22,00:16:23,so they can get the tossing right.
00:16:23,00:16:24,- That's amazing.
00:16:24,00:16:29,"- I have heard about washing woks being a bad thing, right?"
00:16:29,00:16:31,Like you're supposed to...
00:16:31,00:16:31,- I bet.
00:16:31,00:16:33,- You're not supposed to wash your teapot kind of thing
00:16:33,00:16:34,"that's well, right?"
00:16:34,00:16:36,"Yeah, that's just lazy people, isn't it?"
00:16:36,00:16:37,"- Oh, really, yeah."
00:16:37,00:16:38,(laughing)
00:16:38,00:16:41,"- Yeah, I seasoned a pan recently."
00:16:41,00:16:42,What does that mean?
00:16:42,00:16:44,- It's where you get a new...
00:16:44,00:16:45,- Fried on your face.
00:16:45,00:16:46,- I don't know.
00:16:46,00:16:47,- It was quite the thing.
00:16:47,00:16:48,"- Well, it really was, it was kind of,"
00:16:48,00:16:50,"yeah, I'm living that Fraser life now."
00:16:50,00:16:51,I really am.
00:16:51,00:16:52,- That's what noddles are for you.
00:16:52,00:16:54,(laughing)
00:16:54,00:16:57,- You toss your pot noodle for a year before you eat it.
00:16:57,00:16:59,(laughing)
00:16:59,00:17:01,"- It's where you get a new cast iron pan,"
00:17:01,00:17:03,"no nonstick stuff, just pure, you know,"
00:17:03,00:17:05,"lovely cast iron, whatever."
00:17:05,00:17:07,And then you put this tiny layer of oil in
00:17:07,00:17:09,and you cook that very slowly.
00:17:09,00:17:10,And then it kind of bonds with the pan.
00:17:10,00:17:11,- Right.
00:17:11,00:17:12,"- And then you do that a few times,"
00:17:12,00:17:14,again and again and again and do it all over the pan.
00:17:14,00:17:15,You're kind of lathering the pan
00:17:15,00:17:17,and then making a tiny thin layer.
00:17:17,00:17:20,"And it makes it really good at cooking,"
00:17:20,00:17:21,"I don't know, more stuff."
00:17:21,00:17:22,- Andy's usually very private.
00:17:22,00:17:24,"That's his personal, the thing is we've"
00:17:24,00:17:24,(indistinct)
00:17:24,00:17:26,- I feel like I've learned a lot of it.
00:17:26,00:17:27,(laughing)
00:17:27,00:17:28,- Can we cut that bit out?
00:17:28,00:17:29,"Sorry, I can't give you too much away."
00:17:29,00:17:31,"I've got a bit, I'm exposed."
00:17:31,00:17:33,(upbeat music)
00:17:33,00:17:38,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two."
00:17:38,00:17:39,And that is Andy.
00:17:39,00:17:43,"- My fact is that Japan's just found 7,000 islands"
00:17:43,00:17:44,that it didn't know it had.
00:17:44,00:17:49,Japan's doubled basically in one specific respect.
00:17:49,00:17:50,(laughing)
00:17:50,00:17:51,"- Not in size, just in numbers."
00:17:51,00:17:52,"- No, it's still exactly the same size."
00:17:52,00:17:53,"- Wait, how many did it have before?"
00:17:53,00:17:54,"- Yeah, exactly, yeah."
00:17:54,00:17:56,"It had 6,800 before."
00:17:56,00:17:57,"- Oh, why is it still double?"
00:17:57,00:17:58,- It's more than double.
00:17:58,00:17:59,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:17:59,00:18:00,"- That's a good day, isn't it?"
00:18:00,00:18:00,- It's a great day.
00:18:00,00:18:03,"- 'Cause it would be great if one of them was like,"
00:18:03,00:18:04,"Honshu or whatever, the islands."
00:18:04,00:18:06,(laughing)
00:18:06,00:18:07,"But they're all small, right?"
00:18:07,00:18:08,They're all super small.
00:18:08,00:18:09,- Unfortunately.
00:18:09,00:18:10,- I feel like we need more detail.
00:18:10,00:18:11,Where were they?
00:18:11,00:18:14,"- They were all around the main ones, you know,"
00:18:14,00:18:16,and offshore mostly.
00:18:16,00:18:19,"- Did they find them all in one day, in one go?"
00:18:19,00:18:21,"- Well, they've been doing some digital mapping."
00:18:21,00:18:25,"Japan since 1985 has had the same set of maps,"
00:18:25,00:18:27,"which I think are based on older maps,"
00:18:27,00:18:30,whereas now you can survey much more accurately.
00:18:30,00:18:32,"And so there are now 14,000 Japanese islands."
00:18:32,00:18:34,- Are any of them in like the South China Sea
00:18:34,00:18:37,"and claimed by other people, do we think?"
00:18:37,00:18:41,I don't know how many are totally undisputed.
00:18:41,00:18:42,(laughing)
00:18:42,00:18:44,"- Because, you know, the Kuril Islands,"
00:18:44,00:18:46,"which is in the North of Japan,"
00:18:46,00:18:47,which is claimed also by Russia.
00:18:47,00:18:48,- Yes.
00:18:48,00:18:51,- That is a dispute that's still been going
00:18:51,00:18:52,"since World War II,"
00:18:52,00:18:54,and which means that technically World War II
00:18:54,00:18:58,"hasn't finished, because Japan and the Soviet Union"
00:18:58,00:18:59,"haven't agreed on who owns these islands,"
00:18:59,00:19:01,and it was part of World War II.
00:19:01,00:19:02,- That's seriously not our...
00:19:02,00:19:04,"- No, like the last time they talked about it was like,"
00:19:04,00:19:06,"I don't know, 10 years ago, something like that."
00:19:06,00:19:07,"They didn't agree with it then,"
00:19:07,00:19:09,and I can't see them agreeing with it now.
00:19:09,00:19:10,"- That's amazing, what amazing tourist attraction"
00:19:10,00:19:12,that you can go there and you're in World War II.
00:19:12,00:19:13,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:19:13,00:19:16,- And so one of the other things to say is that Japan's
00:19:16,00:19:18,"major land masses, like the four or five islands,"
00:19:18,00:19:22,I think predominantly four are 90% of the land mass.
00:19:22,00:19:24,"So that's, we're talking about the final 3% here"
00:19:24,00:19:28,"that make up the 14,000 extra islands that they have, yeah."
00:19:28,00:19:30,- Are any of them big enough to put a house on?
00:19:30,00:19:32,"- Yeah. - Yeah, I'm sure, yeah."
00:19:32,00:19:33,- You might not want to put a house on them
00:19:33,00:19:35,just in case of sea levels.
00:19:35,00:19:37,"- Yeah, I mean, if you're a short-term list about it."
00:19:37,00:19:38,"- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:19:38,00:19:40,"If you're a dodgy property developer,"
00:19:40,00:19:42,"this is a boom for you, this is great."
00:19:42,00:19:44,"- But it also depends on what you call an island, right?"
00:19:44,00:19:47,What's the difference between a rock and an island size?
00:19:47,00:19:50,"But where does one end and the other one start, right?"
00:19:50,00:19:52,"And in Scotland, they had a traditional thing"
00:19:52,00:19:55,"which was if you could keep a sheep on it, it's an island."
00:19:55,00:19:58,"And if you can't keep a sheep on it, it's a rock."
00:19:58,00:20:00,"- But when you say keep a sheep, you mean can the sheep,"
00:20:00,00:20:02,is there enough grass for the sheep to support itself?
00:20:02,00:20:03,"- Can it survive for, yeah, a few years?"
00:20:03,00:20:05,"- I mean, because presumably you can keep a sheep"
00:20:05,00:20:08,"on visit in any rock, it just depends on the level of cruelty"
00:20:08,00:20:10,you're willing to. - Just stick on strong arms.
00:20:10,00:20:11,"- It's spiky, you know?"
00:20:11,00:20:16,"But yeah, so like what I'm saying, I guess,"
00:20:16,00:20:18,is like a lot of these islands will be super small
00:20:18,00:20:22,"and whether they're officially rocks or islands,"
00:20:22,00:20:24,we don't have a way of deciding.
00:20:24,00:20:26,That's why you can't say how many islands there are
00:20:26,00:20:28,in the UK or how many there are in Canada
00:20:28,00:20:30,or even which country has the most islands
00:20:30,00:20:32,because different people count them in different ways.
00:20:32,00:20:36,- You also couldn't say the circumference of the rock
00:20:36,00:20:38,to give you a definition of whether it's a rock
00:20:38,00:20:40,"or an island because you know this,"
00:20:40,00:20:44,"if you measure the circumference or the length of a coastline,"
00:20:44,00:20:47,"it depends on how big your measuring stick is,"
00:20:47,00:20:48,it's to the answer that you get.
00:20:48,00:20:49,- Go on.
00:20:49,00:20:50,"- Okay, you're close."
00:20:50,00:20:53,- You're about to get masked.
00:20:53,00:20:53,- Buckle up.
00:20:53,00:20:56,"- Okay, so if you just have a map,"
00:20:56,00:20:58,let's say of the British coastline
00:20:58,00:21:01,and you get like a 30 centimeter ruler
00:21:01,00:21:02,"and you go right, how long's the coastline,"
00:21:02,00:21:04,"da, da, da, da, da, like, you know, whatever."
00:21:04,00:21:07,"But then if you got a more accurate measuring stick, right,"
00:21:07,00:21:09,"so one that you were measuring to the millimeter,"
00:21:09,00:21:10,you could kind of get in there
00:21:10,00:21:12,in the nooks and crannies a little bit more
00:21:12,00:21:14,"and go all around them, right?"
00:21:14,00:21:16,And actually you will get longer and longer
00:21:16,00:21:17,and longer each time
00:21:17,00:21:19,"because every time you add in a little crevice,"
00:21:19,00:21:20,"a little nook and cranny,"
00:21:20,00:21:22,you're kind of adding length to it.
00:21:22,00:21:27,So in the limit of looking at an infinitely detailed ruler
00:21:27,00:21:31,"and the infinitesimally small, like nooks and crannies,"
00:21:31,00:21:32,you have an infinite coastline.
00:21:32,00:21:34,"- Wow, that's so cool, that's so interesting."
00:21:34,00:21:35,- Can I tell you a story about my favorite island
00:21:35,00:21:37,in the world? - Yes.
00:21:37,00:21:41,"- Okay, so there's a little place in France,"
00:21:41,00:21:43,this is not my favorite island in the world.
00:21:43,00:21:46,"There's a little lake and it's got a little island in it, right?"
00:21:46,00:21:47,So you cross every little bridge and then you get it.
00:21:47,00:21:49,"And then when you're on the island,"
00:21:49,00:21:52,"it's got a pond in the island, right?"
00:21:52,00:21:54,"Oh, maybe sort of like a small lake,"
00:21:54,00:21:56,"pond to lake, how do you know?"
00:21:56,00:21:57,- What really is a rock pond?
00:21:57,00:21:59,"- Anyway, in the middle of the pond,"
00:21:59,00:22:00,"there's a little island, right?"
00:22:00,00:22:05,"So you've got an island in a lake and on that island,"
00:22:05,00:22:08,there is a lake which also has an island in it.
00:22:08,00:22:09,So essentially recursive islands.
00:22:09,00:22:12,"Now, there are a few of these places around the world,"
00:22:12,00:22:15,but the best one of all is called Vulcan Point
00:22:15,00:22:17,and it's in the Philippines.
00:22:17,00:22:22,"And it's a tiny little island that is inside a lake, right?"
00:22:22,00:22:24,"- Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:22:24,00:22:27,"- It's a very, very small little island like a little rock."
00:22:27,00:22:30,"And that lake is inside a volcano,"
00:22:30,00:22:36,"which is itself surrounded by water,"
00:22:36,00:22:40,"which is on an island, right, in a lake."
00:22:40,00:22:41,"And it's in the Philippines,"
00:22:41,00:22:42,which is in itself an island.
00:22:42,00:22:43,- Wow.
00:22:43,00:22:45,"- Now, the thing is about Vulcan Point,"
00:22:45,00:22:46,is that unfortunately the volcano exploded
00:22:46,00:22:47,and the Vulcan Point was destroyed.
00:22:47,00:22:51,But there is nonetheless photographic evidence
00:22:51,00:22:54,of the point where there was this level
00:22:54,00:22:55,of recursive islands.
00:22:55,00:22:56,- And do you know what?
00:22:56,00:22:58,I think you could put a sheep on it.
00:22:58,00:22:58,- Really?
00:22:58,00:23:00,"- Yeah, it had a great big spike in the middle."
00:23:00,00:23:01,- Can keep a lamb kebab on it.
00:23:01,00:23:02,(laughing)
00:23:02,00:23:04,- Wow. - That's so cool.
00:23:04,00:23:05,- That's extraordinary. - That's so cool.
00:23:05,00:23:06,I love that.
00:23:06,00:23:07,"- There's a really cool island on Japan,"
00:23:07,00:23:10,which is called Gunkanjima Island.
00:23:10,00:23:13,And what's amazing about this is it was once
00:23:13,00:23:17,the most densely populated place on our planet.
00:23:17,00:23:19,"It was, it's quite small."
00:23:19,00:23:20,- Does that mean there's a lot of people
00:23:20,00:23:21,"or is it very, very small?"
00:23:21,00:23:23,- A lot of people for a very small island.
00:23:23,00:23:24,It's a mixture of the two.
00:23:24,00:23:27,So this is the 1900s.
00:23:27,00:23:29,"And this island, there was Mitsubishi."
00:23:29,00:23:30,They looked at it and thought there would be
00:23:30,00:23:33,a lot of rich submarine coal deposit underneath.
00:23:33,00:23:35,So what they did was they built these buildings
00:23:35,00:23:37,on top of the rock.
00:23:37,00:23:38,"They fitted 6,000 people."
00:23:38,00:23:40,"Like there's nothing else you could do,"
00:23:40,00:23:41,but just be in these apartments
00:23:41,00:23:43,and then drill downwards to get it.
00:23:43,00:23:45,"And they were right, there was stuff down there."
00:23:45,00:23:46,"You'll recognize it by the way, possibly,"
00:23:46,00:23:49,if you like popular movies.
00:23:49,00:23:51,It's in James Bond's Skyfall.
00:23:51,00:23:53,It's where Bond goes to this weird island
00:23:53,00:23:55,where it's completely abandoned.
00:23:55,00:23:57,And so people go there now to-
00:23:57,00:23:58,- It means Javier Bardem.
00:23:58,00:23:59,"- Yes, exactly."
00:23:59,00:23:59,"- It's all, yeah, yeah."
00:23:59,00:24:01,- Why was it abandoned?
00:24:01,00:24:03,- Either they mined enough of it or-
00:24:03,00:24:04,"- No, I don't think it was that."
00:24:04,00:24:07,"I think that Japan switched to petrol, tragically."
00:24:07,00:24:08,- Right.
00:24:08,00:24:10,(all laughing)
00:24:10,00:24:12,- Give it away.
00:24:12,00:24:13,"Sorry, for that, Hannah,"
00:24:13,00:24:15,I've got substantial interest in coal.
00:24:15,00:24:15,And-
00:24:15,00:24:16,(all laughing)
00:24:16,00:24:17,- We really are finding out.
00:24:17,00:24:18,- Not about you.
00:24:18,00:24:20,(all laughing)
00:24:20,00:24:22,- Wait 'til you hear the gun to electric.
00:24:22,00:24:22,"- Oh, no."
00:24:22,00:24:24,"Anyway, I don't know."
00:24:24,00:24:27,"Japan just had a big switchover, like, yeah, yeah."
00:24:27,00:24:30,"- The most populated now is Mong Kok, isn't it, in Hong Kong?"
00:24:30,00:24:32,"Just what we were talking about before, yeah, I think so."
00:24:32,00:24:34,- That was always intensely popular in Hong Kong.
00:24:34,00:24:39,"- I think this island was 216,000 people per square mile,"
00:24:39,00:24:41,which is because it was a fraction of a square mile.
00:24:41,00:24:42,"- Feels like a lot, yeah."
00:24:42,00:24:43,"- Give us a comparison, though."
00:24:43,00:24:45,What is it like in central London?
00:24:45,00:24:50,- I know that the least densely populated countries
00:24:50,00:24:52,"are like Mongolia, which have about four people,"
00:24:52,00:24:53,"I think, per square mile."
00:24:53,00:24:54,- And this was how many?
00:24:54,00:24:56,"- 216,000."
00:24:56,00:24:56,(laughing)
00:24:56,00:24:57,- But it's-
00:24:57,00:24:58,- Quite a lot more.
00:24:58,00:24:59,"- Yeah, quite a lot more, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:24:59,00:25:03,"- I went to an island in Japan that has all the rabbits on,"
00:25:03,00:25:04,"and it's just like, you walk,"
00:25:04,00:25:06,"and there's just rabbits everywhere,"
00:25:06,00:25:08,"and you walk down, and they follow you."
00:25:08,00:25:10,"- Are these naturally occurring rabbits,"
00:25:10,00:25:10,or have they been placed there
00:25:10,00:25:12,for the interest of tourists?
00:25:12,00:25:16,"- The story goes that there was a chemical weapons factory,"
00:25:16,00:25:18,"and they were used as experiments,"
00:25:18,00:25:22,"and they were let go, and then they proliferated."
00:25:22,00:25:23,But-
00:25:23,00:25:24,- Bread like rabbits.
00:25:24,00:25:25,"- Well, yeah, exactly, but-"
00:25:25,00:25:27,- I can see why they went with the lizard
00:25:27,00:25:28,for the Godzilla origin story.
00:25:28,00:25:29,(laughing)
00:25:29,00:25:31,- But what we think actually happened
00:25:31,00:25:32,"is there are a lot of school kids nearby,"
00:25:32,00:25:34,"and they put some rabbits on there,"
00:25:34,00:25:36,"and then the rabbits did what rabbits do,"
00:25:36,00:25:38,and became more and more and more rabbits.
00:25:38,00:25:41,"And now, because it's known as Rabbit Island,"
00:25:41,00:25:43,"kids will just come and put their rabbit on there,"
00:25:43,00:25:45,"because it's where rabbits live,"
00:25:45,00:25:48,and it's almost advertised as this wonderful place
00:25:48,00:25:49,where rabbits roam free.
00:25:49,00:25:51,- Sort of like your dog's gone to the farm.
00:25:51,00:25:54,It's like we're just putting your rabbit on Rabbit Island.
00:25:54,00:25:55,"- Yeah, a little bit like that."
00:25:55,00:25:56,- Are they fed?
00:25:56,00:25:58,"- By tourists, and that's the problem really,"
00:25:58,00:26:01,"because the tourist season is quite seasonal,"
00:26:01,00:26:03,"and so for some of the year,"
00:26:03,00:26:04,they don't really get fed at all.
00:26:04,00:26:05,"- Oh, no, okay."
00:26:05,00:26:05,"- Yeah, and it's-"
00:26:05,00:26:08,"- Do you think that'll be a natural population control there,"
00:26:08,00:26:08,wouldn't you?
00:26:08,00:26:12,"- I think it is, but the population is quite high still."
00:26:12,00:26:15,"And you walk around, and there's a few rabbits there,"
00:26:15,00:26:16,"and they're chasing after you,"
00:26:16,00:26:18,"'cause they know the tourists feed them,"
00:26:18,00:26:20,"and then you walk, and then you turn around,"
00:26:20,00:26:21,"and there's a few more,"
00:26:21,00:26:24,"and then you walk a bit further, and there's like 20."
00:26:24,00:26:25,It's just scary.
00:26:25,00:26:25,It's like-
00:26:25,00:26:27,"- It's like the birds, but rabbit."
00:26:27,00:26:28,- Yeah.
00:26:28,00:26:29,"- Cue animals are fine,"
00:26:29,00:26:31,"but when they accumulate, that turns to,"
00:26:31,00:26:33,"there's a number where it gets scary, isn't it,"
00:26:33,00:26:34,when you turn around and there's 40 rabbits.
00:26:34,00:26:36,"- For me, it's like, if there's only two,"
00:26:36,00:26:38,"and then you turn around and there's like six,"
00:26:38,00:26:39,I think that's scary.
00:26:39,00:26:40,"- Oh, yeah."
00:26:40,00:26:43,- Have you ever heard of the work of Greg Gage?
00:26:43,00:26:44,"- Greg Gage, no."
00:26:44,00:26:46,"- So this is a guy, he has this amazing stuff."
00:26:46,00:26:48,He can put a device on your arm
00:26:48,00:26:50,that sends little electric sensors
00:26:50,00:26:51,"and moves your hands for you, right?"
00:26:51,00:26:52,"So he can sort of stand there with this thing on your arm,"
00:26:52,00:26:55,"and with his iPad, he can like, move your arm."
00:26:55,00:26:56,"- Oh, wow."
00:26:56,00:26:57,"- Oh, that's cool."
00:26:57,00:26:57,"- He created this thing,"
00:26:57,00:26:59,"which actually school kids around the world can do,"
00:26:59,00:27:02,where you can operate on a little cockroach
00:27:02,00:27:06,"and insert a little wire into their heads, right,"
00:27:06,00:27:08,and then essentially control them
00:27:08,00:27:09,using a PlayStation controller.
00:27:09,00:27:10,"- Oh, my God."
00:27:10,00:27:11,"- Right, it's absolutely wild."
00:27:11,00:27:12,"Anyway, the thing is, is that, you know,"
00:27:12,00:27:15,you've got this remote-controlled cockroach.
00:27:15,00:27:18,"I always thought that he was missing a massive trick, though,"
00:27:18,00:27:20,"because what he should do is get sort of gloves,"
00:27:20,00:27:21,which can tell where his hands are.
00:27:21,00:27:23,"There's, you know, those kind of gloves"
00:27:23,00:27:24,that are connected to it.
00:27:24,00:27:27,"And then have an entire army of cockroaches behind him,"
00:27:27,00:27:29,"right, like a rabbit,"
00:27:29,00:27:31,and then summon them by like lifting his arms up.
00:27:31,00:27:34,"- Yeah, like a Marvel superhero for cockroaches."
00:27:34,00:27:35,- Wow.
00:27:35,00:27:37,"- Maybe next, he can do rabbits."
00:27:37,00:27:39,"- Yeah, I'm up for it."
00:27:39,00:27:40,"The rabbits, I don't think, like me,"
00:27:40,00:27:41,'cause I accidentally kicked one.
00:27:41,00:27:43,"'Cause they were kind of, they just ran around."
00:27:43,00:27:44,"- Accidentally, here he is."
00:27:44,00:27:46,- Getting his defense in first.
00:27:46,00:27:48,- They just run around your feet the whole time.
00:27:48,00:27:49,"- Oh, sure, sure."
00:27:49,00:27:50,"- Yeah, yeah. - Wow."
00:27:50,00:27:51,- That'd be a great shot.
00:27:51,00:27:53,"- And yet, you converted it through a rugby post"
00:27:53,00:27:55,"that was nearby, and that's what's going on."
00:27:55,00:27:56,(all laughing)
00:27:56,00:27:58,"So, I was just looking up things"
00:27:58,00:27:59,that are going on in Japan at the moment.
00:27:59,00:28:00,"- Oh, yeah."
00:28:00,00:28:03,- And have you heard of the Sushi Terror?
00:28:03,00:28:04,"- No, no."
00:28:04,00:28:05,"- Yeah, Japan is in the grip of it."
00:28:05,00:28:07,"Right now, as we're recording this,"
00:28:07,00:28:08,"there's a huge problem,"
00:28:08,00:28:11,because there's a craze that's developed.
00:28:11,00:28:14,"It's an online craze, and it's spread to offline."
00:28:14,00:28:15,- You know the conveyor belt sushi restaurants?
00:28:15,00:28:16,- Yeah.
00:28:16,00:28:17,- People have started mucking around
00:28:17,00:28:18,with the stuff on the belts.
00:28:18,00:28:19,- Not in Japan.
00:28:19,00:28:21,- Touching the things.
00:28:21,00:28:22,- What?
00:28:22,00:28:23,- Licking bottles of soy sauce.
00:28:23,00:28:24,- No. - It's very bad.
00:28:24,00:28:25,"I'm filming themselves as they do it,"
00:28:25,00:28:29,"and this is obviously really bad, you know."
00:28:29,00:28:31,Can you just have a little quiz for you guys?
00:28:31,00:28:32,"- Oh, cool, great."
00:28:32,00:28:34,- When did the first conveyor belt sushi restaurant open?
00:28:34,00:28:35,What year?
00:28:35,00:28:36,"- 1990, in New York."
00:28:36,00:28:37,- Very nice.
00:28:37,00:28:39,"Oh, at the location, very nice."
00:28:39,00:28:40,"- Oh, wow, okay, okay."
00:28:40,00:28:41,"- Wrong, though."
00:28:41,00:28:42,- Look at his face. - I'm not saying
00:28:42,00:28:43,until we've got all-- - Look at his face.
00:28:43,00:28:44,"- Oh, please, I'm very good at playing."
00:28:44,00:28:48,"- The first escalator came in Harrods, in the UK,"
00:28:48,00:28:51,around 1920s or something like that.
00:28:51,00:28:52,- It's not really playing the game
00:28:52,00:28:55,"to use previous knowledge, but okay, I like it, yes."
00:28:55,00:28:57,"- So, I'm gonna say, it was in Harrods."
00:28:57,00:28:58,They decided to open one.
00:28:58,00:29:03,"They took that technology, and just put little sushi on it."
00:29:03,00:29:04,"- Okay, and a year?"
00:29:04,00:29:06,"- Probably 1927, I should think."
00:29:06,00:29:07,"- Right, Dan?"
00:29:07,00:29:11,"- Oh, there's not much nowhere for me to go."
00:29:11,00:29:12,It's not happened yet.
00:29:12,00:29:13,- Brilliant.
00:29:13,00:29:15,(all laughing)
00:29:15,00:29:16,- 2029. - 2029.
00:29:16,00:29:17,- Any day now.
00:29:17,00:29:20,"- Yeah, it's all an illusion, we've been had."
00:29:20,00:29:22,"- Well, okay, it was interesting to me."
00:29:22,00:29:24,"James is lobal, that's so much."
00:29:24,00:29:25,"- Oh, I'm sorry."
00:29:25,00:29:27,"- No, it's quite all right, but it's 1958."
00:29:27,00:29:28,- Okay. - I am surprised by that.
00:29:28,00:29:30,- That is quite a long time ago.
00:29:30,00:29:32,It predates Cliff Richard's first album by a year.
00:29:32,00:29:34,- And that is how we judge everything.
00:29:34,00:29:36,"It was Hannah, you haven't been on the show before,"
00:29:36,00:29:38,"but that's all about it. - That's a magic shot, okay."
00:29:38,00:29:39,- That is a long-- - Wow.
00:29:39,00:29:41,- I'm surprised. - Yeah.
00:29:41,00:29:43,"- I was gonna say, I don't know if we've ever mentioned it."
00:29:43,00:29:46,I don't think we have the first ever English teacher
00:29:46,00:29:49,who was of a foreign country teaching English
00:29:49,00:29:53,in the country was a guy called Ronald McDonald.
00:29:53,00:29:55,"He was the first person to teach in Japan,"
00:29:55,00:29:58,"which would be a great, nice coincidence"
00:29:58,00:30:00,"if Ronald McDonald, who is a character in McDonald's"
00:30:00,00:30:03,"in Japan, was called Ronald McDonald, but he's not."
00:30:03,00:30:04,- What? - It's called Donald McDonald.
00:30:04,00:30:06,"- What, who? - What?"
00:30:06,00:30:07,- Yeah. - Is it 'cause the letter R
00:30:07,00:30:09,is difficult to say? - Exactly.
00:30:09,00:30:10,And it's interesting looking at it online
00:30:10,00:30:11,when people have written about it.
00:30:11,00:30:13,There's been tweets about it.
00:30:13,00:30:14,"And if you go to the replies,"
00:30:14,00:30:16,"there's a lot of Japanese people who are like,"
00:30:16,00:30:18,"you know, in their 30s, going, ""He's called Ronald?"""
00:30:18,00:30:21,"Like, so it's like, it's a genuinely amazing thing,"
00:30:21,00:30:23,"but over there, he's Donald."
00:30:23,00:30:24,- Did you say you were in Japan recently?
00:30:24,00:30:26,"- I was in Japan, yeah, filming."
00:30:26,00:30:27,"- Well, where do you-- - I was in Tokyo,"
00:30:27,00:30:29,but the good bit-- - Yeah.
00:30:29,00:30:32,"- I got to go inside the exclusion zone in Fukushima,"
00:30:32,00:30:34,which was-- - Wow.
00:30:34,00:30:35,- Wild.
00:30:35,00:30:37,The whole place is extraordinary.
00:30:37,00:30:40,"There are these buildings, there's one sort of town hall"
00:30:40,00:30:42,"that we went to, and the doors are locked,"
00:30:42,00:30:44,"but inside, you can just see everybody's slippers,"
00:30:44,00:30:47,"and there was like a kid's toy on the floor,"
00:30:47,00:30:50,"and then, you know, like, beer bottles, right?"
00:30:50,00:30:52,"They'd had a party or something the night before,"
00:30:52,00:30:54,and there's like a crate with sort of the empties
00:30:54,00:30:55,"that they hadn't got rid of. - Wow, yeah."
00:30:55,00:30:58,"- And just like, everybody left in such a rush"
00:30:58,00:30:59,'cause of the tsunami.
00:30:59,00:31:01,"But one of the reasons why we were going there,"
00:31:01,00:31:04,"we were looking at wildlife and how wildlife has changed,"
00:31:04,00:31:06,and there were reports before we got there
00:31:06,00:31:10,"that there were radioactive bears inside the exclusion zone,"
00:31:10,00:31:11,which I was obviously very excited about.
00:31:11,00:31:12,- Yeah.
00:31:12,00:31:13,"- So we got there, we started, right,"
00:31:13,00:31:15,we're literally on a bear hunt.
00:31:15,00:31:17,(all laughing)
00:31:17,00:31:18,- And we asked good.
00:31:18,00:31:21,"- Yeah, so many of the radiation, but you know, whatever."
00:31:21,00:31:23,"Anyway, we went to talk to a sexist and we're like,"
00:31:23,00:31:24,"""Okay, tell us about these bears."""
00:31:24,00:31:26,"And, you know, we couldn't find any bears."
00:31:26,00:31:28,"So, ""Okay, so how much have you seen these bears?"""
00:31:28,00:31:30,"And then it transpired that actually,"
00:31:30,00:31:35,the bear researcher themselves had only seen one bear once.
00:31:35,00:31:38,"- Right, okay."
00:31:38,00:31:40,"Actually, there wasn't radioactive bears at all."
00:31:40,00:31:42,"It was radioactive bear, which may or may not be there."
00:31:42,00:31:43,- Wow.
00:31:43,00:31:44,- Yeah.
00:31:44,00:31:45,- I'd love to find that bear.
00:31:45,00:31:46,That sounds amazing.
00:31:46,00:31:47,The radioactive bear.
00:31:47,00:31:49,"- I'm not as strongly suspected as a boar,"
00:31:49,00:31:51,"just, you know, on a spiny angle."
00:31:51,00:31:52,- Just a spiny angle.
00:31:52,00:31:53,"- Oh, yeah."
00:31:53,00:31:54,(all laughing)
00:31:54,00:31:56,(upbeat music)
00:31:56,00:32:01,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:32:01,00:32:03,and that is James.
00:32:03,00:32:06,"- Okay, my fact this week is that if you grew up in a city,"
00:32:06,00:32:08,then you have a worse sense of direction
00:32:08,00:32:10,than someone born in the countryside.
00:32:10,00:32:13,Though it doesn't seem to work if you're from Hungary.
00:32:13,00:32:14,- Hmm.
00:32:14,00:32:17,"- Okay, again, we're gonna need more data."
00:32:17,00:32:21,"- So this is a study published last year in Nature,"
00:32:21,00:32:23,and it assessed the navigational skills
00:32:23,00:32:26,"of 400,000 people across 38 countries."
00:32:26,00:32:27,And what they did was they asked people
00:32:27,00:32:30,to memorize a map in a video game.
00:32:30,00:32:31,"And then once they memorized it,"
00:32:31,00:32:34,they got them to get their characters to go through this map.
00:32:34,00:32:37,And they worked out how good everyone wasn't navigating.
00:32:37,00:32:39,And they found that it was very clear
00:32:39,00:32:42,that people who grew up in cities
00:32:42,00:32:44,tended to have a worse sense of direction.
00:32:44,00:32:46,"People who were in the countryside had a better,"
00:32:46,00:32:49,and people in the suburbs were always in between the two.
00:32:49,00:32:51,So it was a real good correlation.
00:32:51,00:32:52,And they said it was strong in places
00:32:52,00:32:54,"like Argentina, the UK, and the US."
00:32:54,00:32:57,"But there were countries like Hungary, for example,"
00:32:57,00:32:59,"this is a quote, where there was no real difference,"
00:32:59,00:33:02,"but on average, the trend held."
00:33:02,00:33:05,- So is that because Hungary has very simple cities
00:33:05,00:33:07,or complicated countryside?
00:33:07,00:33:10,"- I've been to Hungary, and for instance, in Budapest,"
00:33:10,00:33:11,"I would say it's not that different to London,"
00:33:11,00:33:14,"'cause it's an old, very old city that's built up."
00:33:14,00:33:15,- It's Higley-de-Pigley-D.
00:33:15,00:33:18,"- Yeah, not like New York, which is in a grid."
00:33:18,00:33:20,- And that's why they said people with a worse sense
00:33:20,00:33:22,of direction were people who grew up in grid cities.
00:33:22,00:33:24,- They tend to be the worst.
00:33:24,00:33:26,"- Yeah, I mean, well, that makes sense, right?"
00:33:26,00:33:28,- And they kind of speculate slightly
00:33:28,00:33:31,that you don't have as much signpost telling you
00:33:31,00:33:32,which way to go and that kind of stuff.
00:33:32,00:33:33,- It's pretty amazing.
00:33:33,00:33:36,So the game that was created for them to do this
00:33:36,00:33:37,"is called, whoops, sorry."
00:33:37,00:33:38,- Is it Quest?
00:33:38,00:33:40,"- It is, it's Sea Hero Quest."
00:33:40,00:33:41,"- Okay, I need to tell you about, go on, keep going."
00:33:41,00:33:42,"- Oh, do you know it?"
00:33:42,00:33:43,"- Yes, keep going."
00:33:43,00:33:45,"- So this game, as of April 22nd, 2022,"
00:33:45,00:33:49,"has been now played by over 4.3 million players,"
00:33:49,00:33:51,not necessarily all for this exact thing
00:33:51,00:33:52,"that you're talking about, James."
00:33:52,00:33:54,It's just an incredible way of gathering data.
00:33:54,00:33:58,- Is this a particular thing that's used in science too?
00:33:58,00:34:00,"- Yeah, it's like this amazing kind of game"
00:34:00,00:34:02,"that is fun to play,"
00:34:02,00:34:04,but then you're also collecting data from it.
00:34:04,00:34:07,"But the reason why I love it so much is that,"
00:34:07,00:34:10,"okay, so there are particular cells in your brain"
00:34:10,00:34:12,"that help you with navigation,"
00:34:12,00:34:14,and they found these in mice and rats.
00:34:14,00:34:17,"So some of them are called play cells,"
00:34:17,00:34:18,"and essentially what happens, right?"
00:34:18,00:34:22,"Let's say you put a rat in a rectangular room, okay?"
00:34:22,00:34:26,You can put a kind of cute little hat on the rat
00:34:26,00:34:27,"that will measure what's going on in the brain,"
00:34:27,00:34:31,and you can work out when particular neurons are firing.
00:34:31,00:34:33,"And it turns out that in, let's say,"
00:34:33,00:34:34,"the northeast corner of the room,"
00:34:34,00:34:37,if there's one neuron that fires in this rat's brain
00:34:37,00:34:39,"while it's in that location,"
00:34:39,00:34:41,it will not fire anywhere else.
00:34:41,00:34:44,"It's like a specific neuron that is like,"
00:34:44,00:34:46,"this is the northeast corner, a play cell."
00:34:46,00:34:49,And actually what you can do is you can elongate
00:34:49,00:34:51,the zone in which that neuron fires
00:34:51,00:34:53,by putting a rat into an identical room
00:34:53,00:34:56,that is just stretched out longer.
00:34:56,00:34:58,"So it's like the northeast corner becomes bigger,"
00:34:58,00:35:01,and so where this neuron fires also becomes bigger.
00:35:01,00:35:02,"Anyway, the thing is, is that they have to do this"
00:35:02,00:35:04,"while the rats are going around in little rooms,"
00:35:04,00:35:08,but it's quite hard to hook up this rat to the hat
00:35:08,00:35:10,that's measuring what's going on in their brain.
00:35:10,00:35:12,- You're not gonna put a spike in it like the cockroach.
00:35:12,00:35:12,Are you?
00:35:12,00:35:16,"'Cause I was a bit squeamish about that, and I was like..."
00:35:16,00:35:18,"- It's only tiny, the cockroach is fine."
00:35:18,00:35:19,The cockroach is fine.
00:35:19,00:35:20,"- Okay, okay."
00:35:20,00:35:23,"- No, so what they do is they put the little hat on the rat,"
00:35:23,00:35:25,"and then they put the rat on a ball,"
00:35:25,00:35:27,"and then the rat can run around,"
00:35:27,00:35:28,and the ball moves underneath them
00:35:28,00:35:29,"as though they're running freely,"
00:35:29,00:35:31,and then they put it in front of a computer
00:35:31,00:35:32,and get it to play Quest.
00:35:32,00:35:33,- No.
00:35:33,00:35:34,- Yeah.
00:35:34,00:35:35,- Wow.
00:35:35,00:35:36,"- Yeah, so the rat's like running around"
00:35:36,00:35:37,playing this computer game.
00:35:37,00:35:38,- Oh my God.
00:35:38,00:35:39,"- It's almost like VR for the rat, right?"
00:35:39,00:35:40,- Totally.
00:35:40,00:35:42,"- It thinks that it's in this well that I get,"
00:35:42,00:35:43,I don't know.
00:35:43,00:35:43,- Totally.
00:35:43,00:35:44,"- Probably doesn't even know it's a rat,"
00:35:44,00:35:46,"but it's like, you know, it's like,"
00:35:46,00:35:48,"it imagines that it's actually going round, right?"
00:35:48,00:35:49,"- Yeah, and it's the screen,"
00:35:49,00:35:52,it's like a little rat-sized IMAX.
00:35:52,00:35:52,- Amazing.
00:35:52,00:35:53,- That's amazing.
00:35:53,00:35:55,"- Well, one more thing about this study,"
00:35:55,00:35:56,"and why it might be important,"
00:35:56,00:35:58,is because poor navigation skills
00:35:58,00:36:01,"are sometimes used to help identify dementia in people,"
00:36:01,00:36:04,and so you need to know what your base level
00:36:04,00:36:07,of navigation skills would be for a normal person.
00:36:07,00:36:09,"So if you live in the city or the countryside,"
00:36:09,00:36:11,"and you have poor navigation skills,"
00:36:11,00:36:12,"it could be 'cause you have dementia,"
00:36:12,00:36:14,but you need to know what your original was.
00:36:14,00:36:15,"- See, that's clever."
00:36:15,00:36:17,"I read that if you follow Google Maps,"
00:36:17,00:36:18,"if you follow the blue line,"
00:36:18,00:36:21,your sense of direction gets much worse over time.
00:36:21,00:36:22,"- Yeah, well, it's like your brain's like a muscle, right?"
00:36:22,00:36:23,You've got to practice it.
00:36:23,00:36:24,- So I turned it off yesterday.
00:36:24,00:36:25,I turned off the blue line.
00:36:25,00:36:26,"I had to get somewhere,"
00:36:26,00:36:27,"had to walk for about half an hour across London,"
00:36:27,00:36:29,"and I turned it off,"
00:36:29,00:36:31,"and it was only about three corners in the whole journey,"
00:36:31,00:36:32,so it was really--
00:36:32,00:36:33,"- Well, it's the blue line."
00:36:33,00:36:34,Sorry.
00:36:34,00:36:35,"- On Google Maps, you know, there's a blue line,"
00:36:35,00:36:37,"you put it in directions to somewhere,"
00:36:37,00:36:38,it gives you a little blue line.
00:36:38,00:36:39,- Right.
00:36:39,00:36:40,"- You follow that line,"
00:36:40,00:36:41,and then you get to the place you're going.
00:36:41,00:36:41,- Okay.
00:36:41,00:36:45,I got lost on the way between Holborn and Cronk Garden just now.
00:36:45,00:36:46,"I mean, that's what I'm saying, it's like."
00:36:46,00:36:48,(laughing)
00:36:48,00:36:49,- Amazing.
00:36:49,00:36:51,- I've lived here for 20 years.
00:36:51,00:36:53,I used to have an A to Z in my pocket.
00:36:53,00:36:54,"I used to be able to like,"
00:36:54,00:36:56,"""I was fine now, I just can't do it."""
00:36:56,00:36:59,"You know what, there's a cabbie who I use quite a lot,"
00:36:59,00:37:00,and I have a game that I play with him
00:37:00,00:37:01,"where I'll be in a part of London,"
00:37:01,00:37:05,"and I'll just send him a photo of a door,"
00:37:05,00:37:07,and it's unreal.
00:37:07,00:37:08,"- Sorry, you've got your own personal cabbie?"
00:37:08,00:37:09,"- No, not my--"
00:37:09,00:37:10,(laughing)
00:37:10,00:37:12,"- We say chauffeur, normally."
00:37:12,00:37:14,- You'll never have guessed who I had in this card.
00:37:14,00:37:16,"It was you, yeah, it was you."
00:37:16,00:37:18,"- No, he's not my personal cabbie."
00:37:18,00:37:19,"He's like, he's a tame cabbie."
00:37:19,00:37:21,(laughing)
00:37:21,00:37:22,- I think that's still very impressive.
00:37:22,00:37:23,"Like, I've never--"
00:37:23,00:37:24,- Yeah?
00:37:24,00:37:26,"- Like, first you give up pop noodles,"
00:37:26,00:37:28,and then this is the next step.
00:37:28,00:37:30,"- Has this cabbie feels got a spike in his head,"
00:37:30,00:37:32,"and you just raise your hand, and he arrives."
00:37:32,00:37:35,(laughing)
00:37:35,00:37:36,- Wow.
00:37:36,00:37:37,"- Sorry, you send him photos, and he just says,"
00:37:37,00:37:38,"""That's where you are."""
00:37:38,00:37:39,"- Yeah, he knows."
00:37:39,00:37:39,- That's cool.
00:37:39,00:37:40,- He knows the door. - That is very cool.
00:37:40,00:37:41,- Do you want to try it now?
00:37:41,00:37:42,Should I take a first look at the window?
00:37:42,00:37:43,- Yeah.
00:37:43,00:37:44,- Don't put a street sign on.
00:37:44,00:37:46,"- That's great, and it's just hanging out the window"
00:37:46,00:37:47,of our office right now.
00:37:47,00:37:49,(laughing)
00:37:49,00:37:50,"- We could even say where we are,"
00:37:50,00:37:52,'cause this is the last time we're ever in this office.
00:37:52,00:37:54,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, so, yeah."
00:37:54,00:37:55,"So, let's see if he comes back with this,"
00:37:55,00:37:57,but we're on Maiden Lane.
00:37:57,00:37:58,Let's see if he gets Maiden Lane.
00:37:58,00:38:00,- So exciting.
00:38:00,00:38:02,- It's extraordinary.
00:38:02,00:38:03,"- I used to live on a street where,"
00:38:03,00:38:06,which was in the cabbie's knowledge exam.
00:38:06,00:38:07,"- Oh, yeah."
00:38:07,00:38:08,"- And that was really useful,"
00:38:08,00:38:09,because you didn't have to give them anything.
00:38:09,00:38:10,"You'd just say you're on that street,"
00:38:10,00:38:12,"and they'd be like, ""Oh, yeah, we know what that is."""
00:38:12,00:38:14,"- I did too, so I lived on Sandwich Street."
00:38:14,00:38:15,- All right.
00:38:15,00:38:16,- And they always do bacon lane to Sandwich Street.
00:38:16,00:38:17,(laughing)
00:38:17,00:38:18,- Lovely. - Great.
00:38:18,00:38:19,- What was your one?
00:38:19,00:38:20,"- It was Digby Crescent,"
00:38:20,00:38:22,but I don't know where they would have gone to.
00:38:22,00:38:22,"- Everard, Digby."
00:38:22,00:38:26,"- Everard Road to Digby Crescent, yeah."
00:38:26,00:38:26,"Oh, he's typing."
00:38:26,00:38:27,- Oh!
00:38:27,00:38:28,"- Okay, hold on, hold on."
00:38:28,00:38:30,- That's quick.
00:38:30,00:38:32,"- Okay, he's too quick."
00:38:32,00:38:33,I'm gonna have to edit in a space.
00:38:33,00:38:34,- Exactly. - Yeah.
00:38:34,00:38:36,"- He says, ""Is it an official test?"""
00:38:36,00:38:37,I think yes.
00:38:37,00:38:38,- Yes. - Yes.
00:38:38,00:38:39,"- We revoke your license, if you."
00:38:39,00:38:41,(laughing)
00:38:41,00:38:42,"- Well, let's do a bit of talking"
00:38:42,00:38:45,and then see if he gets to give it some space.
00:38:45,00:38:46,"Just very quickly,"
00:38:46,00:38:47,you're mentioning you got lost
00:38:47,00:38:48,from Holborn to Covent Garden.
00:38:48,00:38:50,So I've discovered and made contact
00:38:50,00:38:52,"with a guy called Tristan Goole,"
00:38:52,00:38:53,who's an amazing guy.
00:38:53,00:38:55,He writes incredible books
00:38:55,00:38:58,about how you can anywhere in London
00:38:58,00:39:00,orientate yourself by various things.
00:39:00,00:39:01,"- Yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:39:01,00:39:02,"- If you're in the morning,"
00:39:02,00:39:04,go against the flow of people walking towards you
00:39:04,00:39:06,because predominantly that group
00:39:06,00:39:08,will be coming from a tube station.
00:39:08,00:39:09,And if you need to find a tube station
00:39:09,00:39:10,at the end of the day.
00:39:10,00:39:11,- Not if you live in a commuter town.
00:39:11,00:39:13,They're all going to the tube station.
00:39:13,00:39:15,"- Oh, sorry, this is London, central London."
00:39:15,00:39:17,He's talking about it. - But you've woken up
00:39:17,00:39:19,and the kidnappers told you you're in central London
00:39:19,00:39:20,but I'm not going to tell you where.
00:39:20,00:39:21,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:39:21,00:39:23,- And you said which zone is like one or two.
00:39:23,00:39:24,(laughing)
00:39:24,00:39:27,- And at no point to say just ask somebody where you are.
00:39:27,00:39:29,"- Well, his idea is that you shouldn't ask"
00:39:29,00:39:30,someone where you are.
00:39:30,00:39:30,You should make the challenge
00:39:30,00:39:32,of working out your navigation better.
00:39:32,00:39:34,"If you see a tree in London,"
00:39:34,00:39:35,look if it has a tilt on it.
00:39:35,00:39:37,"Because if it has a tilt,"
00:39:37,00:39:38,that will be pointing to the south.
00:39:38,00:39:41,"- I always think in London go downhill,"
00:39:41,00:39:42,you'll get to the river eventually.
00:39:42,00:39:43,"- Yeah, right, okay."
00:39:43,00:39:44,- I don't know if that's true.
00:39:44,00:39:45,- It feels like it.
00:39:45,00:39:46,"- I mean, they're our local maxima though."
00:39:46,00:39:49,(all laughing)
00:39:49,00:39:50,- I was reading a book called
00:39:50,00:39:51,"The Lost Art of Finding Our Way,"
00:39:51,00:39:53,which is by an author called John Huff.
00:39:53,00:39:55,And he was talking about urban myths of navigation.
00:39:55,00:39:57,"How, you know, there's one of,"
00:39:57,00:39:59,"it's not the tilt on the tree,"
00:39:59,00:40:00,you know the other one of the tree?
00:40:00,00:40:01,- It's like moss on one side of the tree.
00:40:01,00:40:03,- Moss grows on the north side of a tree
00:40:03,00:40:05,"because it's cooler, darker, shadier,"
00:40:05,00:40:06,and not on the south.
00:40:06,00:40:08,"And it doesn't, it only happens in mid-latitudes"
00:40:08,00:40:10,in the northern hemisphere.
00:40:10,00:40:11,So you need to know which hemisphere you're in.
00:40:11,00:40:13,So it's not a perfect test.
00:40:13,00:40:14,- Can you flush a toilet first
00:40:14,00:40:16,and see which way the water is?
00:40:16,00:40:17,"- Yeah, I don't know."
00:40:17,00:40:18,"There's a toilet next to a tree,"
00:40:18,00:40:19,so you do know that here.
00:40:19,00:40:20,But also--
00:40:20,00:40:21,"- If you don't know what hemisphere you're in though,"
00:40:21,00:40:22,I think you're in good much more trouble.
00:40:22,00:40:24,- You can look at the stars and I'll tell you.
00:40:24,00:40:26,- How long was I blindfolded for?
00:40:26,00:40:29,Was it enough to do a 16-hour flight?
00:40:29,00:40:30,Shall we look at the phone?
00:40:30,00:40:31,"- Yes, yeah."
00:40:31,00:40:32,"- Let's have a look, let's see."
00:40:32,00:40:33,Okay.
00:40:33,00:40:34,- What's he saying?
00:40:34,00:40:35,- We've got a response.
00:40:35,00:40:37,"Okay, we sent this at 1237"
00:40:37,00:40:40,"and he replied at 1239, maiden name."
00:40:40,00:40:42,- Oh my God.
00:40:42,00:40:43,- I wanna know how he did it though.
00:40:43,00:40:45,- What's in the photo that you can--
00:40:45,00:40:46,- Can I call him and ask him?
00:40:46,00:40:46,"- Yeah, go check it."
00:40:46,00:40:47,- Put it on speaker.
00:40:47,00:40:49,"- Yeah, well."
00:40:49,00:40:50,It was the mass on the north side.
00:40:50,00:40:53,(laughing)
00:40:53,00:40:56,- How did you do it?
00:40:56,00:40:58,- I knew roughly where you were
00:40:58,00:41:00,because there's a safe door.
00:41:00,00:41:01,- Oh.
00:41:01,00:41:02,- Yes.
00:41:02,00:41:06,"- And I'm, there's no traffic in that street."
00:41:06,00:41:07,So I know it's somewhere annoying
00:41:07,00:41:09,like Soho or Cumbergarden.
00:41:09,00:41:11,- Right.
00:41:11,00:41:15,- And then I just used my pills and deductions.
00:41:15,00:41:16,- Wow.
00:41:16,00:41:18,"- Hi, so Richard, Dan Shriver here,"
00:41:18,00:41:19,no such thing as a fish.
00:41:19,00:41:20,Thanks for being on the show.
00:41:20,00:41:23,"What did you, is that genuinely the final guess"
00:41:23,00:41:25,was a punt or did you know it?
00:41:25,00:41:28,- I did recognise the street but I did use a stage door
00:41:28,00:41:30,and the fact that I could tell there's no traffic
00:41:30,00:41:31,in that street anymore.
00:41:31,00:41:33,I'm not allowed to drive down it.
00:41:33,00:41:36,So it did look familiar and I kind of worked it out
00:41:36,00:41:37,from back then.
00:41:37,00:41:37,- Amazing.
00:41:37,00:41:38,"- All right, cheers, Rich."
00:41:38,00:41:39,I'll talk to you later on.
00:41:39,00:41:40,- Amazing.
00:41:40,00:41:41,"- Thanks, Benny."
00:41:41,00:41:42,"- Oh, I wish he ended that by going,"
00:41:42,00:41:43,"oh, gotta go."
00:41:43,00:41:44,Professor Brian Cox has called him.
00:41:44,00:41:47,He's saying a picture for me to analyse.
00:41:47,00:41:49,- That is really cool.
00:41:49,00:41:50,"- God, that's good."
00:41:50,00:41:50,- Yeah.
00:41:50,00:41:51,- Wow.
00:41:51,00:41:52,- He's never not got one.
00:41:52,00:41:54,"It's one day, one day."
00:41:54,00:41:55,- That's so cool.
00:41:55,00:41:59,- We were talking about Holborn area
00:41:59,00:42:02,and do you remember when they changed the rules
00:42:02,00:42:03,that you were allowed to stand on both sides
00:42:03,00:42:04,of the escalator?
00:42:04,00:42:05,"- Yeah, I do."
00:42:05,00:42:06,"- Holborn, yes."
00:42:06,00:42:07,- It's a very long escalator.
00:42:07,00:42:07,- Were you angry about it?
00:42:07,00:42:08,- Yeah.
00:42:08,00:42:09,- Why?
00:42:09,00:42:10,- You were incorrect the angle.
00:42:10,00:42:11,"- I know, I do know."
00:42:11,00:42:12,"- Okay, just warning."
00:42:12,00:42:13,- TFL justification for the trial.
00:42:13,00:42:14,"- So just to explain, sorry,"
00:42:14,00:42:17,"in London when we go down an escalator in the underground,"
00:42:17,00:42:18,you have to stand on the right hand side
00:42:18,00:42:21,and you're allowed to walk along the left hand side.
00:42:21,00:42:23,"But they said from now on,"
00:42:23,00:42:25,everyone's standing on both sides.
00:42:25,00:42:26,"- Yeah, right."
00:42:26,00:42:28,"My problem with it is,"
00:42:28,00:42:29,"I know what you're gonna say, Hannah,"
00:42:29,00:42:31,you're gonna say it's mathematically more efficient.
00:42:31,00:42:33,You will get more people on and through the escalator
00:42:33,00:42:36,if everyone's just standing.
00:42:36,00:42:37,- I will say that.
00:42:37,00:42:40,"- Okay, my perspective is, as a commuter,"
00:42:40,00:42:42,it's less pleasant.
00:42:42,00:42:44,It's okay standing and there are people moving past you.
00:42:44,00:42:46,If you're standing with people in front behind
00:42:46,00:42:49,"and next to you, it's a bit of a squash."
00:42:49,00:42:49,And there's this awkward thing
00:42:49,00:42:51,where you might have to make conversation with someone
00:42:51,00:42:55,or you'll make eye contact or they'll start a fight
00:42:55,00:42:55,"or they'll say, what are you doing?"
00:42:55,00:42:56,- Start a fight?
00:42:56,00:42:58,(laughing)
00:42:58,00:42:59,"- Just, it's too tight."
00:42:59,00:43:01,"- Look, I would accept that as a response."
00:43:01,00:43:03,And I would accept that you would prefer
00:43:03,00:43:06,to have a slower journey time to avoid that.
00:43:06,00:43:08,But for the fact that you're just about to slam yourself
00:43:08,00:43:10,into a tube carriage
00:43:10,00:43:13,"with 50,000 other people into their armpits."
00:43:13,00:43:14,- Yeah.
00:43:14,00:43:15,"- You know, it's definitely no more Sardini"
00:43:15,00:43:17,than when you get on the tube.
00:43:17,00:43:19,- It feels impersonal and cold.
00:43:19,00:43:20,I love the freedom of just running up
00:43:20,00:43:22,"those escalator steps and, you know,"
00:43:22,00:43:24,"it's just, you know, you feel like you're really"
00:43:24,00:43:25,getting somewhere.
00:43:25,00:43:27,"Like, oh, these slow coaches are standing on the right."
00:43:27,00:43:28,"- You're just putting, yeah."
00:43:28,00:43:29,- It jumps on the right.
00:43:29,00:43:30,"Yeah, it jumps on the right."
00:43:30,00:43:32,The legend's on the left is what I would have to find.
00:43:32,00:43:34,(laughing)
00:43:34,00:43:35,- Do you know?
00:43:35,00:43:37,"Well, basically a lot of people felt the same way as you,"
00:43:37,00:43:41,"Andy, but like Hannah says, it was successful"
00:43:41,00:43:43,and way more people could get down the escalator.
00:43:43,00:43:44,"- People don't like math, James."
00:43:44,00:43:45,People don't like math.
00:43:45,00:43:46,- Forget about the maths.
00:43:46,00:43:47,Just think about the gaps.
00:43:47,00:43:48,"If you were like looking down on it,"
00:43:48,00:43:51,"say you were like, you know, in the control room."
00:43:51,00:43:53,Looking down on the escalator.
00:43:53,00:43:56,"If people are walking down, there's much bigger gaps,"
00:43:56,00:43:57,which basically means you've got
00:43:57,00:43:58,"all of that wasted space, right?"
00:43:58,00:44:00,So you get a much higher flux.
00:44:00,00:44:03,"- It's not wasted space, it's the hero's aura."
00:44:03,00:44:06,"- It's, you're spotting who's a drone."
00:44:06,00:44:07,Who's willing to do what the system tells them.
00:44:07,00:44:09,Please stand on the escalator.
00:44:09,00:44:09,- The sheeples.
00:44:09,00:44:10,"- Yeah, yeah, exactly."
00:44:10,00:44:12,- I like standing in the fast lane
00:44:12,00:44:13,when there's no one there.
00:44:13,00:44:15,(laughing)
00:44:15,00:44:16,- But only when there's no one there.
00:44:16,00:44:17,- Only when there's no one there.
00:44:17,00:44:20,"Yeah, and that's because you like to play with norms."
00:44:20,00:44:21,"You subvert, you twist."
00:44:21,00:44:22,- Exactly.
00:44:22,00:44:23,- You kick rabbits when--
00:44:23,00:44:24,- I tell you--
00:44:24,00:44:26,(laughing)
00:44:26,00:44:29,"- Is that still in place, that law in Holburne?"
00:44:29,00:44:29,- Which one?
00:44:29,00:44:31,- The Tube Law.
00:44:31,00:44:32,"- No, no, it was a trial."
00:44:32,00:44:35,- The double work thing and it didn't really take off.
00:44:35,00:44:37,Thanks to my letter writing campaign.
00:44:37,00:44:39,"- Yeah, I was gonna say, the QI offices,"
00:44:39,00:44:41,we are moving and we're moving to Holburne
00:44:41,00:44:43,and it's just the sadistic bit of me
00:44:43,00:44:46,would love to know that that's now your Tube station.
00:44:46,00:44:48,- I sabotaged it by leaving small pieces of sushi
00:44:48,00:44:51,which I had licked on every other thing.
00:44:51,00:44:54,(upbeat music)
00:44:54,00:45:00,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show"
00:45:00,00:45:01,and that is my fact.
00:45:01,00:45:05,My fact this week is that an inventor called Yifei Chen
00:45:05,00:45:08,has designed a gun which collects tears from your face
00:45:08,00:45:12,so you can shoot them back at the person who made you cry.
00:45:12,00:45:15,"- Tears, even if you're really upset,"
00:45:15,00:45:17,"it's not a super soka, is it?"
00:45:17,00:45:19,"- No, it's not, but have you seen it?"
00:45:19,00:45:20,Have you seen the video of it?
00:45:20,00:45:21,"- No, have I seen it?"
00:45:21,00:45:23,- It shoots out with more force than it ought.
00:45:23,00:45:23,"- She's built it, hasn't she?"
00:45:23,00:45:25,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:45:25,00:45:26,- Like to the point where it would hurt.
00:45:26,00:45:28,- We got a back track on that.
00:45:28,00:45:31,It's got similar force to a super soka
00:45:31,00:45:32,because what it does is it collects the tears
00:45:32,00:45:35,but then there's a sort of canister that freezes it
00:45:35,00:45:37,so it kind of turns.
00:45:37,00:45:38,- What?
00:45:38,00:45:39,"- But what does it do, Andy?"
00:45:39,00:45:40,"'Cause it doesn't, it's still liquid."
00:45:40,00:45:41,It's not ice particles.
00:45:41,00:45:43,"So it's not like, it's not tear bullets."
00:45:43,00:45:44,It's still--
00:45:44,00:45:45,- Is it tear gas?
00:45:45,00:45:47,(laughs)
00:45:47,00:45:48,"- It's kind of what it is, weirdly."
00:45:48,00:45:50,"- Right, yeah."
00:45:50,00:45:53,"- But then at the time it takes to freeze,"
00:45:53,00:45:54,are you still gonna be upset at the person who made you cry?
00:45:54,00:45:55,"- No, exactly."
00:45:55,00:45:57,"So it's not an immediate,"
00:45:57,00:46:00,I wouldn't bring it to an actual gun fight.
00:46:00,00:46:03,"- Is it like, your tears are best served cold, right?"
00:46:03,00:46:04,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly."
00:46:04,00:46:07,"- And often, you know, one finds that you're actually"
00:46:07,00:46:08,the one who's made yourself cry.
00:46:08,00:46:10,(laughs)
00:46:10,00:46:12,"You know, you have control over what you're crying"
00:46:12,00:46:13,in this situation.
00:46:13,00:46:14,"- Andy goes home, has a little cry"
00:46:14,00:46:16,and then fires about himself.
00:46:16,00:46:18,(laughs)
00:46:18,00:46:20,This is all your fault.
00:46:20,00:46:21,- That's interesting that you think you have control over
00:46:21,00:46:23,whether you cry in a situation.
00:46:23,00:46:25,"- Yeah, I'm now thinking about my tear ducts so much."
00:46:25,00:46:26,- You look like you're crying.
00:46:26,00:46:27,- I know.
00:46:27,00:46:29,- I definitely do not have control over crying.
00:46:29,00:46:31,- Very involuntary tears.
00:46:31,00:46:31,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:46:31,00:46:33,"- I cry all the time, I try not to."
00:46:33,00:46:35,"Yeah, because I'm often, I'll watch like a really,"
00:46:35,00:46:38,"like a really heartfelt, like Oprah Winfrey,"
00:46:38,00:46:40,the YouTube clip on the Tube or on the train.
00:46:40,00:46:41,(laughs)
00:46:41,00:46:43,And it gets me every time.
00:46:43,00:46:45,"And it's embarrassing 'cause you have people next to you,"
00:46:45,00:46:46,right?
00:46:46,00:46:48,"- So hang on, is that why you don't want this escalator thing?"
00:46:48,00:46:50,So then you can have that moment of privacy.
00:46:50,00:46:51,"- It's really, yeah."
00:46:51,00:46:53,The length of the Holborn escalator is about
00:46:53,00:46:56,"a one classic clip of Oprah, length of time."
00:46:56,00:46:58,- So random.
00:46:58,00:47:00,- Do you watch that Tom Cruise jumping up and down
00:47:00,00:47:00,on her sofa?
00:47:00,00:47:03,"- No, it's not emotional, I like the emotional stuff, yeah."
00:47:03,00:47:04,- Do you like Dr. Phil?
00:47:04,00:47:05,"- No, I don't watch Dr. Phil."
00:47:05,00:47:07,I like military homecoming videos
00:47:07,00:47:09,or pregnancy announcement videos.
00:47:09,00:47:12,"- I quite like homecoming, yeah."
00:47:12,00:47:13,"The other one I really like,"
00:47:13,00:47:16,when I just want a really good cry is a dog rescue.
00:47:16,00:47:17,"- Oh, nice."
00:47:17,00:47:19,"- Yeah, 'cause sometimes you get the dogs"
00:47:19,00:47:20,and they're in such a little state.
00:47:20,00:47:21,"- Oh, I haven't done that yet."
00:47:21,00:47:24,"- And you know, like, they'll often have like,"
00:47:24,00:47:26,"you know, loads of light and loads of like ticks"
00:47:26,00:47:28,"and things and horrible, you know, like scaly skin."
00:47:28,00:47:31,And then what's really nice is when they patch them all up
00:47:31,00:47:33,and then they get ready to be rescued
00:47:33,00:47:34,"by, you know, go to an adoptive home."
00:47:34,00:47:35,They're all fluffy again.
00:47:35,00:47:36,- Oh my God.
00:47:36,00:47:37,"Well, you need to-"
00:47:37,00:47:38,- You do this to yourself.
00:47:38,00:47:39,- I do.
00:47:39,00:47:40,It's very therapeutic.
00:47:40,00:47:41,- This is fucking weird.
00:47:41,00:47:42,"There's a Venn diagram that you,"
00:47:42,00:47:43,"I'd love to introduce you to,"
00:47:43,00:47:45,"which is military homecoming videos,"
00:47:45,00:47:46,but where they come home to the dog
00:47:46,00:47:48,"and the dog reacts, woof."
00:47:48,00:47:50,That's a new level of emotion.
00:47:50,00:47:51,"- Whoa, there."
00:47:51,00:47:53,And you do that on the tube.
00:47:53,00:47:54,- Yeah.
00:47:54,00:47:55,- You just go on the tube and you just want to cry
00:47:55,00:47:56,when you're on the tube.
00:47:56,00:47:58,"- Well, I just suddenly have a hankering to-"
00:47:58,00:47:59,"- It's the algorithm, you know?"
00:47:59,00:48:00,"I'll be watching something,"
00:48:00,00:48:01,but I've watched so much of it.
00:48:01,00:48:03,"I'll, you know, it'd be like a comedy clip"
00:48:03,00:48:05,of someone I want to watch in an underneath.
00:48:05,00:48:08,"It's like, Oprah gives $16,000 to a desperate mum"
00:48:08,00:48:09,who lost her house in a hurricane.
00:48:09,00:48:11,- Is this actually just to stop people
00:48:11,00:48:12,sitting next to you on the tube?
00:48:12,00:48:15,(laughing)
00:48:15,00:48:17,"Andy, what do you watch to make you cry on the tube?"
00:48:17,00:48:20,(laughing)
00:48:20,00:48:22,- I don't think I consciously watch things
00:48:22,00:48:24,that will make me cry.
00:48:24,00:48:25,"I've seen, sometimes you'll see a clip"
00:48:25,00:48:26,that's doing the rounds online
00:48:26,00:48:27,and you find it moving.
00:48:27,00:48:28,- I just think about my career.
00:48:28,00:48:31,(laughing)
00:48:31,00:48:33,"I would say, for me, the only thing really"
00:48:33,00:48:36,that makes me a bit like that is sporting events
00:48:36,00:48:38,"when people, you know-"
00:48:38,00:48:40,- Like a classic turnaround?
00:48:40,00:48:41,Like a last minute Hail Mary?
00:48:41,00:48:45,"- Yeah, someone who's like reached the life's ambition."
00:48:45,00:48:45,- Yeah.
00:48:45,00:48:46,- The Olympics.
00:48:46,00:48:47,- Yeah.
00:48:47,00:48:48,"- Oh man, cry fest."
00:48:48,00:48:49,- A little bit.
00:48:49,00:48:50,- I'll tell you what you'll love then.
00:48:50,00:48:51,It's called the knock.
00:48:51,00:48:53,When the NFL players are told they've made it
00:48:53,00:48:55,into the Hall of Fame and someone goes around
00:48:55,00:48:56,knocking on the door.
00:48:56,00:48:57,"Oh, the emotion in that."
00:48:57,00:48:57,- I think-
00:48:57,00:48:58,- Especially when there's a dog involved.
00:48:58,00:48:59,(laughing)
00:48:59,00:49:00,The puppy bowl.
00:49:00,00:49:02,- The Crufts in the Hall of Fame.
00:49:02,00:49:04,(laughing)
00:49:04,00:49:05,"- Anyway, that's a-"
00:49:05,00:49:07,"- Gosh, we've learned a lot."
00:49:07,00:49:07,(laughing)
00:49:07,00:49:08,- So.
00:49:08,00:49:09,"- Oh, damn."
00:49:09,00:49:10,- Yifei Chen.
00:49:10,00:49:12,"So she's actually, we say inventor."
00:49:12,00:49:16,She's actually a designer and she was at a design school
00:49:16,00:49:18,and this was the thing where she grew up in Taiwan
00:49:18,00:49:22,"and you're trying not to return anger towards authority,"
00:49:22,00:49:24,your school teachers or your parents or so on.
00:49:24,00:49:27,I think that's just part of the culture a bit so much there.
00:49:27,00:49:29,Less so when she went overseas and she was studying
00:49:29,00:49:31,in the Netherlands and she noticed
00:49:31,00:49:33,that she was being told off
00:49:33,00:49:35,and she watched someone step up for her
00:49:35,00:49:37,but she realized she couldn't do it for herself.
00:49:37,00:49:39,"So she had a cry and she thought, I felt really weak."
00:49:39,00:49:41,So I want to use my weakness and turn it into power.
00:49:41,00:49:43,What if I invented a gun?
00:49:43,00:49:44,(laughing)
00:49:44,00:49:45,- Amazing.
00:49:45,00:49:45,- What if I did the most punishing
00:49:45,00:49:46,and literal interpretation?
00:49:46,00:49:48,(laughing)
00:49:48,00:49:48,It's very cool.
00:49:48,00:49:49,It's an amazing looking invention.
00:49:49,00:49:50,"- It's beautiful, yeah."
00:49:50,00:49:54,"- It has these tear collecting half moons under the eyes,"
00:49:54,00:49:56,and a little pipe that then leads down
00:49:56,00:49:58,into the cartridge or chamber or whatever you think.
00:49:58,00:50:00,"- Yeah, and she did it as part of her course."
00:50:00,00:50:01,She designed the gun.
00:50:01,00:50:03,"So on her graduation, she actually went up"
00:50:03,00:50:06,"and she fired the gun at the head of the department,"
00:50:06,00:50:06,Shan Boli.
00:50:06,00:50:07,- I know what you're thinking.
00:50:07,00:50:09,Did I cry six tears or only five?
00:50:09,00:50:13,(laughing)
00:50:13,00:50:14,Do you feel weepy?
00:50:14,00:50:16,(laughing)
00:50:16,00:50:19,Tell you about another inventor invention or something.
00:50:19,00:50:20,"- Please, please."
00:50:20,00:50:22,- Have you guys heard of the knee defender?
00:50:22,00:50:23,- No.
00:50:23,00:50:24,- I think we're about to.
00:50:24,00:50:26,"- Yeah, if you're on a plane."
00:50:26,00:50:26,"- Oh no, I know."
00:50:26,00:50:28,"- You fit this to the seat in front of you,"
00:50:28,00:50:29,"to the back of the seat in front of you,"
00:50:29,00:50:30,and it means the person in front of you
00:50:30,00:50:31,can't recline their seat.
00:50:31,00:50:33,"- Oh, wow."
00:50:33,00:50:35,- And then they're banned on a lot of airlines.
00:50:35,00:50:36,- There they are.
00:50:36,00:50:37,- They're a controversial contraband thing.
00:50:37,00:50:39,And the inventor is six foot three.
00:50:39,00:50:40,(laughing)
00:50:40,00:50:43,He says that it was more to start a conversation.
00:50:43,00:50:44,- I bet it does.
00:50:44,00:50:45,(laughing)
00:50:45,00:50:48,"- So it's, basically it comes with a little card"
00:50:48,00:50:49,for your fellow passenger if you get one of these.
00:50:49,00:50:52,"And it reads, ""I realized that this may be an inconvenience."
00:50:52,00:50:54,"""If so, I hope you will complain to the airline."
00:50:54,00:50:56,"""Maybe working together, we can convince the airline"
00:50:56,00:50:58,"""to provide enough space between rows"
00:50:58,00:50:59,"""so people can recline their seats"
00:50:59,00:51:00,"""without banging into other passengers."""
00:51:00,00:51:01,- What a dick.
00:51:01,00:51:02,- Yeah.
00:51:02,00:51:03,- What a dick.
00:51:03,00:51:05,"- And he is, you have got some of these, haven't you?"
00:51:05,00:51:06,- I'm glad to see you.
00:51:06,00:51:08,"- I mean, it's like I fundamentally agree"
00:51:08,00:51:11,"that you, that the airlines do put them too close together"
00:51:11,00:51:13,"and it means that actually you can't,"
00:51:13,00:51:15,"you have to, one person has to sacrifice their comfort"
00:51:15,00:51:16,and that seems unfair.
00:51:16,00:51:19,"But him being like, one of us has to sacrifice their comfort."
00:51:19,00:51:21,And this time it's not gonna be me.
00:51:21,00:51:22,- Yeah.
00:51:22,00:51:23,"- And in fact, on no occasion it's gonna be me."
00:51:23,00:51:24,- No.
00:51:24,00:51:25,"- Well, yeah."
00:51:25,00:51:27,- What he needs to do is fly business like I do.
00:51:27,00:51:29,And you manage to do that by eating nothing but pot noodles
00:51:29,00:51:31,and saving your money.
00:51:31,00:51:33,"- If you fly first class like I do,"
00:51:33,00:51:36,then you all recline and you know.
00:51:36,00:51:38,"- It doesn't look so bad that sometimes I get cabs now,"
00:51:38,00:51:39,does it?
00:51:39,00:51:40,(all laughing)
00:51:40,00:51:42,- I actually have my own airline pilot.
00:51:42,00:51:43,(all laughing)
00:51:43,00:51:44,- Take a photo of some sky.
00:51:44,00:51:46,(all laughing)
00:51:46,00:51:50,"- New Jersey, isn't it?"
00:51:50,00:51:51,(all laughing)
00:51:51,00:51:52,Lovely.
00:51:52,00:51:56,"- We got an email in the fish inbox about,"
00:51:56,00:51:58,and this is about innovation rather than about
00:51:58,00:52:01,"inventions exactly, but it's just so interesting."
00:52:01,00:52:03,'Cause it was a guy called Mark Emmerton who sent in a fact
00:52:03,00:52:06,"about something, a nuclear, a nuclear test."
00:52:06,00:52:07,Okay.
00:52:07,00:52:09,"And he said, ""I have a fact from my late great uncle"
00:52:09,00:52:12,"who actually worked on the nuclear test program,"
00:52:12,00:52:14,"the British nuclear test program in the '50s."""
00:52:14,00:52:17,"And he says, ""This is probably classified for all I know,"
00:52:17,00:52:18,"but fuck it."""
00:52:18,00:52:19,(all laughing)
00:52:19,00:52:20,- So.
00:52:20,00:52:21,- And a guy.
00:52:21,00:52:22,- Yeah.
00:52:22,00:52:23,Right.
00:52:23,00:52:26,"The UK and US used to share test sites in the Pacific,"
00:52:26,00:52:28,but each would bring their own instruments
00:52:28,00:52:30,to measure the power of nuclear tests on the ground.
00:52:30,00:52:33,The US had very sensitive state-of-the-art pressure
00:52:33,00:52:35,"transducers, but they kept getting broken"
00:52:35,00:52:38,or having their readings wiped by shockwaves and radiation.
00:52:38,00:52:39,Okay.
00:52:39,00:52:41,"The UK, with a much smaller budget,"
00:52:41,00:52:43,realized that you could measure the pressure
00:52:43,00:52:46,of a nuclear blast just by getting a squeezy tube
00:52:46,00:52:47,of toothpaste.
00:52:47,00:52:48,(all laughing)
00:52:48,00:52:52,"Taking the cap off and then placing a ruler next to it,"
00:52:52,00:52:54,the pressure of the blast would squirt out toothpaste
00:52:54,00:52:56,"proportionally to the blast strength,"
00:52:56,00:52:59,and there were no electronics to go wrong.
00:52:59,00:52:59,They worked.
00:52:59,00:53:00,- That's genius.
00:53:00,00:53:01,"- Oh, that's amazing."
00:53:01,00:53:04,"I mean, there is a story about this, about Fermi."
00:53:04,00:53:05,Do you know this story?
00:53:05,00:53:08,"So Fermi, this amazing, amazing physicist,"
00:53:08,00:53:09,and he had.
00:53:09,00:53:10,- Enrico.
00:53:10,00:53:11,- Enrico.
00:53:11,00:53:14,He had a reputation for being able to do
00:53:14,00:53:15,calculations in his head.
00:53:15,00:53:19,"And during the first test, he decided he wanted"
00:53:19,00:53:22,to try and work out how strong the blast was.
00:53:22,00:53:24,"And so he stood in the observation tower,"
00:53:24,00:53:26,which I think was some distance away from the block.
00:53:26,00:53:27,"I mean, you would assume."
00:53:27,00:53:29,(all laughing)
00:53:29,00:53:30,"And he tore up a tiny bit of paper,"
00:53:30,00:53:32,"sheet of paper into tiny little bits,"
00:53:32,00:53:33,and he held it in his hand.
00:53:33,00:53:36,"And then as the blast exploded, he opened his hand"
00:53:36,00:53:39,and then paced out how far they'd been blown
00:53:39,00:53:41,"across the room, and then got within, I think,"
00:53:41,00:53:44,a factor of two of the equivalent in dynamite.
00:53:44,00:53:46,"So I think, I mean, it's totally legitimate"
00:53:46,00:53:47,that you can do this.
00:53:47,00:53:50,"You don't get perfectly accurate results, weirdly enough."
00:53:50,00:53:52,"But yeah, you can get really close."
00:53:52,00:53:54,- That's really cool.
00:53:54,00:53:56,- I was just on classified stuff.
00:53:56,00:53:58,I read the other day about a girl in America
00:53:58,00:54:01,who went to her school's show-and-tell
00:54:01,00:54:04,with a load of classified US government documents.
00:54:04,00:54:06,(all laughing)
00:54:06,00:54:07,- From like her dad and mom.
00:54:07,00:54:09,"- No, it was even worse than that."
00:54:09,00:54:12,"So there'd been, someone from the government"
00:54:12,00:54:14,"had been at something and then had lost their briefcase,"
00:54:14,00:54:16,so I just left it there.
00:54:16,00:54:18,"And their dad, this girl's dad had found it"
00:54:18,00:54:20,and sort of just picked it up and looked through it
00:54:20,00:54:22,and it all said classified and stuff.
00:54:22,00:54:23,And then he just took it home
00:54:23,00:54:25,and then they kept it in the attic
00:54:25,00:54:26,and never did anything with it.
00:54:26,00:54:28,"And then like five or six years later,"
00:54:28,00:54:30,"she was like, ""I need something for show-and-tell."""
00:54:30,00:54:32,"Went up and then, ""Oh, I'll take this."""
00:54:32,00:54:34,And then took it down and it was like all stuff
00:54:34,00:54:37,about Iran and Libya and stuff like that.
00:54:37,00:54:39,- Was she detained?
00:54:39,00:54:40,"- Well, yeah, she's--"
00:54:40,00:54:41,- She was in Guantanamo.
00:54:41,00:54:44,(all laughing)
00:54:44,00:54:47,- The teacher got in touch with the CIA
00:54:47,00:54:49,and is that the right person or the FBI?
00:54:49,00:54:50,"- Yeah, it would be the CIA."
00:54:50,00:54:50,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:54:50,00:54:52,"And said, ""We have this."""
00:54:52,00:54:55,And they came and sent some people in dark glasses
00:54:55,00:54:56,to retrieve it.
00:54:56,00:54:58,"- Wow, they were quietly waiting at the back of the show"
00:54:58,00:54:59,"and tell our blooming tillie,"
00:54:59,00:55:01,"talked about a conch that she's found, you know."
00:55:01,00:55:04,(all laughing)
00:55:04,00:55:07,- And I think probably the person who lost it
00:55:07,00:55:09,might have got killed or killed.
00:55:09,00:55:12,"- It was all a happy ending and that's amazing, that's so cool."
00:55:12,00:55:13,- Here's another new invention.
00:55:13,00:55:15,"This is from, I think, 2022,"
00:55:15,00:55:17,which I mentioned it to my wife
00:55:17,00:55:19,and she's looking into getting one.
00:55:19,00:55:21,It's a motion pillow three.
00:55:21,00:55:23,(all laughing)
00:55:23,00:55:24,- Is it a mega hanky?
00:55:24,00:55:27,(all laughing)
00:55:27,00:55:29,- It's a YouTube Prime account.
00:55:29,00:55:33,I can get rid of all those nasty ads getting in the way.
00:55:33,00:55:34,"- It's a what, sorry?"
00:55:34,00:55:36,"- Motion pillow three, it's called."
00:55:36,00:55:37,"- It's a pillow, right?"
00:55:37,00:55:39,- And you have a snorer down there.
00:55:39,00:55:40,Is that where we're going?
00:55:40,00:55:41,"- Ooh, I thought of it."
00:55:41,00:55:42,- Does it smother you?
00:55:42,00:55:44,(all laughing)
00:55:44,00:55:46,"- Yeah, my wife is very keen on getting one."
00:55:46,00:55:47,- It's a weighted blanket for the face.
00:55:47,00:55:49,"It's how it's sold, yeah."
00:55:49,00:55:51,"No, is it a pillow that moves under you,"
00:55:51,00:55:54,it undulates under you to keep you asleep?
00:55:54,00:55:55,- No.
00:55:55,00:55:57,- Does it massage you?
00:55:57,00:55:57,"- No, that'd be nice."
00:55:57,00:55:59,- Does it do what Andy said but stop you from snoring?
00:55:59,00:56:01,"- Exactly, I can't believe that you didn't build"
00:56:01,00:56:03,on the snoring thing.
00:56:03,00:56:05,"What it is is when you're laying down,"
00:56:05,00:56:08,"if you're snoring, there are four airbags inside"
00:56:08,00:56:12,and it's AI kind of generated so it inflates
00:56:12,00:56:15,to move your head around until the position
00:56:15,00:56:16,where the airwaves are opened up properly
00:56:16,00:56:18,and you stop snoring and it means
00:56:18,00:56:19,that you just reduce snoring.
00:56:19,00:56:20,- No way.
00:56:20,00:56:22,"- Yeah, this is a motion pillow three."
00:56:22,00:56:23,- You're gonna say you're not waking up
00:56:23,00:56:26,"when someone is, your pillow is slowly grinding"
00:56:26,00:56:27,your head in the ground.
00:56:27,00:56:28,(all laughing)
00:56:28,00:56:29,- Does it make a noise?
00:56:29,00:56:30,"Is there a, is there a-"
00:56:30,00:56:32,- When your neck snaps it does.
00:56:32,00:56:34,(all laughing)
00:56:34,00:56:36,- It's a way to assassinate some of us then.
00:56:36,00:56:38,- Incredible.
00:56:38,00:56:39,- Is that why motion pillow one and two
00:56:39,00:56:40,didn't make it to one?
00:56:40,00:56:43,(all laughing)
00:56:43,00:56:45,- Can I tell you about the Corby trouser press?
00:56:45,00:56:46,- Yeah.
00:56:46,00:56:47,- Just while we're on game-changing inventions
00:56:47,00:56:48,of the 20th century.
00:56:48,00:56:49,- Thanks.
00:56:49,00:56:50,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:56:50,00:56:52,"- I just, we're losing a lot of inventors now"
00:56:52,00:56:53,who invented really big things.
00:56:53,00:56:54,And I'm not saying the Corby.
00:56:54,00:56:57,(all laughing)
00:56:57,00:56:59,"But like the inventor of the kettle off switch,"
00:56:59,00:57:00,"for example, is still alive."
00:57:00,00:57:01,"- Oh yeah, it's still going."
00:57:01,00:57:02,- He's a professor of invention
00:57:02,00:57:03,in Oxford or something like that.
00:57:03,00:57:05,- It's called John Taylor.
00:57:05,00:57:07,"This is a slight tangent or a tangent to myself,"
00:57:07,00:57:09,"but it's, do you know how the kettle off switch works?"
00:57:09,00:57:10,- Is it a bimetallic strip?
00:57:10,00:57:11,- Yeah.
00:57:11,00:57:12,I just love bimetallic strips.
00:57:12,00:57:13,- At least the-
00:57:13,00:57:14,- What is it?
00:57:14,00:57:15,- Well that's interesting.
00:57:15,00:57:16,I haven't thought about this before.
00:57:16,00:57:17,I do remember trying to buy a kettle
00:57:17,00:57:19,which didn't have one and it was really hard.
00:57:19,00:57:20,- Really?
00:57:20,00:57:21,Why were you trying to-
00:57:21,00:57:23,- I don't remember.
00:57:23,00:57:25,But I think it was something to do with stamps
00:57:25,00:57:28,and legal activity that the post office
00:57:28,00:57:29,can't find out about.
00:57:29,00:57:30,- What?
00:57:30,00:57:31,(all laughing)
00:57:31,00:57:34,"- So bimetallic strip is as it sounds,"
00:57:34,00:57:36,it's a strip of two different metals
00:57:36,00:57:38,"all the way along, right?"
00:57:38,00:57:42,And they expand and contract at different temperatures
00:57:42,00:57:44,because of the chemical composition.
00:57:44,00:57:47,"So as it gets hot water on it, the strip,"
00:57:47,00:57:49,it will bend because one side
00:57:49,00:57:51,is expanding more than the other.
00:57:51,00:57:54,And you can develop those and it snaps the kettle off
00:57:54,00:57:55,at a certain temperature.
00:57:55,00:57:56,It's a bimetallic strip.
00:57:56,00:57:58,- I think that I love bimetallic strips
00:57:58,00:58:00,is the most Andy sentence I've ever heard you say.
00:58:00,00:58:02,(all laughing)
00:58:02,00:58:03,"- Well, we had one in the house when I was growing up"
00:58:03,00:58:05,and it was a very cool scientific experiment to do.
00:58:05,00:58:06,- What a kettle.
00:58:06,00:58:07,(all laughing)
00:58:07,00:58:09,- That's all those pot noodles you're gonna have in it.
00:58:09,00:58:12,(upbeat music)
00:58:12,00:58:15,"- Okay, that's it."
00:58:15,00:58:16,That is all of our facts.
00:58:16,00:58:18,Thank you so much for listening.
00:58:18,00:58:19,If you'd like to get in contact with any of us
00:58:19,00:58:21,about the things that we've said
