1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,660
 They don't want to get away from me?

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:15,160
 Hello and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,840
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covern Garden.

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,340
 My name is Dan Schreiber sitting here with Andy Murray, Anichezinski and James Harkin.

5
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,480
 Once again we've gathered around the microphone with our fourth favorite facts from the last

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,200
 seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,080
 And with fact number one, Andy Hunter Murray.

8
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,560
 My fact is that there have been three top 50 songs in the British charts, which have

9
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,720
 been sung exclusively in Latin.

10
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,920
 Wow, I bet you won all three of them though.

11
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,920
 Yeah, I do.

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,240
 Just a mix tape of three Latin songs.

13
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:50,120
 Yeah, one of them actually made it into the Alan Partridge movie last year, yeah, yeah,

14
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,880
 which was a Gaudette by Steele Iceman, which is a religious, unfortunately they're all

15
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,960
 a bit religious rather than an abyss song which they just happened to fancy doing in Latin.

16
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,480
 I didn't know we got religious songs in our pop chart and our top 40 track of the pop.

17
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,480
 Yeah.

18
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,080
 They're just choirs.

19
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,080
 Constantly.

20
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,720
 Anyway, the other one was from Avita in 1976, which is choral in Latin, another was a recording

21
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,120
 of PA Jesus from Andrew Lloyd Webber's Requiem.

22
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,120
 That's fantastic song.

23
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,120
 Right.

24
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,960
 So two of these are, and is the other one from Avita, you said?

25
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,960
 Yes.

26
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,960
 So two of them are Andrew Lloyd Webber songs.

27
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,200
 Two of the three Latin songs are Andrew Lloyd Webber, right?

28
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,160
 Avita being an Andrew Lloyd Webber.

29
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,160
 Yeah.

30
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,160
 Yeah.

31
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,160
 So there you go.

32
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,160
 Well done.

33
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,160
 Well done Drew.

34
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,360
 So yeah, it's just interesting the sort of the things that get into the pop charts over

35
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,360
 the years.

36
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,360
 Yeah.

37
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,360
 Yeah.

38
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,160
 And it was, it's easy and now to get things in the pop charts because you can just, everyone

39
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,480
 can download something at the same time and then it can get in the charts.

40
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,240
 Whereas in the olden days you actually had to release a record or a CD or something for

41
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,280
 it to get in the charts because these days you could get a very popular person on the

42
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,240
 radio saying everyone download a Latin song and it would just get in the charts.

43
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,240
 Yeah, you're right.

44
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,480
 It doesn't need to be the Taylor Swift album that came out last year.

45
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:07,080
 They accidentally on the iTunes downloads included a track, just of white noise.

46
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,420
 And because it just went viral, everyone bought it and it went to the top of the charts

47
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,420
 in Canada.

48
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,420
 That's right.

49
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,420
 Every other pure white.

50
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,420
 It must have been so angry.

51
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,420
 Yeah.

52
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,420
 Aladdin's bar is set going.

53
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,420
 This is ironic.

54
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:26,020
 So, do you know that the Mel Gibson film The Passion was in a mix of Aramaic and Latin?

55
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,020
 Yeah.

56
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:31,020
 It turns out that the Latin that they used in The Passion of the Christ is church Latin

57
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:36,020
 and not classical Latin which means the entire thing is an anachronism.

58
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,020
 That's funny.

59
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,860
 I'm really, really pleased by that.

60
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,660
 They pronounce their visas W's.

61
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,660
 I don't know.

62
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,140
 I don't know how much we do know about the pronunciation of classical Latin.

63
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:49,660
 I think the journal content is the classical Latin, it was pronounced as a W and then church

64
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,660
 Latin, it's a V.

65
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,660
 And if they screwed that up.

66
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,660
 Wow.

67
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,660
 They fell at the first hurdle.

68
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,660
 Yeah.

69
00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:01,820
 So, some of them chart trivia, which day of the week has had the most songs written about

70
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,820
 it.

71
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,820
 So, it's in the title.

72
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,820
 Oh, okay.

73
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,820
 Monday.

74
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,820
 Yeah.

75
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,820
 Monday.

76
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,820
 Yeah, obviously.

77
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:09,820
 I want to go with Friday.

78
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,820
 Oh, well, you're all wrong.

79
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:17,380
 It's Sunday, 30 songs with the word Sunday and so 30 songs with Sunday and 23 with Saturday

80
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,940
 11 with Friday, which is a third and only one song.

81
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,740
 This is in the billboard charts has ever been written with the word Thursday in the title.

82
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,740
 You won.

83
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,740
 Yeah.

84
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,340
 Sweet Thursday by Johnny Mathis in 1962.

85
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,700
 Okay, this is my favorite fact about the charts.

86
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,700
 Okay.

87
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:39,060
 It is that Paul McCartney has had 200 songs in the charts.

88
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:44,500
 So either Beatles songs, Wingsong, Solo songs, songs are these written for other people.

89
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:50,260
 If you take the amount of time and accumulate all the time that those 200 songs have spent

90
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,860
 in the charts, they add up to 32 years.

91
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,860
 Right.

92
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,860
 That's amazing.

93
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,860
 Oh.

94
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:02,060
 He's had songs in the charts that are for a longer period than I've been alive by two years.

95
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,060
 That's pretty good.

96
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,060
 That's insane.

97
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,020
 And do you know who I found out that fact from?

98
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,020
 Who?

99
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,020
 President Obama.

100
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,020
 Wow.

101
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,020
 President Obama just tweeting factoids.

102
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,020
 Yeah, he's going.

103
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,020
 Yeah, he runs OMG.

104
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,020
 They've just signed them up.

105
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,020
 Yeah, yeah.

106
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,020
 Good for him.

107
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:19,620
 Yeah, he, uh, he won the Gershwin prize at the White House where they do it.

108
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,220
 And he gave a speech and he said he was an interesting fact about Paul and then told that.

109
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,220
 Well, I see.

110
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,220
 Do you think that was original research from?

111
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,220
 From.

112
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,220
 It's all own research.

113
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:32,220
 Um, I had a thing about Lassen, which I wanted to tell you because I really, really like

114
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,220
 it.

115
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:38,980
 Um, when Pope Benedict, the 16th resigned, one of the journalists who broke up with

116
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:45,020
 the story, only got it because she could understand the Latin in which he made the announcement.

117
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,020
 Right.

118
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,180
 And as a result, she got the scoop before anybody else.

119
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,780
 Her name was Giovanna Cheery.

120
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,580
 Oh, she must have been very cheery about that.

121
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,580
 Yeah.

122
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,580
 It was a weird one, wasn't it?

123
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,820
 Because he was just doing a general talk to about six or seven journalists and they were

124
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,340
 just talking about basic stuff.

125
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,300
 They all understood what he was saying was being translated.

126
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,620
 And then he spoke that bit in Latin, that particular bit.

127
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,620
 Right.

128
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,940
 She was the only one who got it.

129
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,300
 And she kind of pre-announced it without confirmation.

130
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,300
 She was lucky.

131
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,300
 She was right.

132
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,300
 Yeah.

133
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,300
 She was a bit like, I'm not sure if he did.

134
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,300
 I'm pretty sure he did just say that.

135
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,580
 Did that word mean resign or olive?

136
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,580
 Yeah.

137
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,580
 Ah.

138
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,580
 Ah.

139
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,740
 I just wanted an olive, guys.

140
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,580
 But it's an interesting thing, they, um, because Latin in the Vatican, obviously, is still

141
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,580
 a big thing.

142
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,220
 They're constantly updating because of all the new words that we have.

143
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,220
 Yeah.

144
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,220
 That's so good.

145
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,220
 Have we spoken about that particular thing?

146
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,900
 Like words like dishwasher are now in the new Latin dictionary.

147
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:41,140
 And so are, um, what web there is web, web, web, and they're quite behind if they've only

148
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,140
 just updated it with digital.

149
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,140
 I mean, yeah.

150
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:48,980
 About my phone and rush hour, which I don't know when that movie made it to the Vatican.

151
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:52,140
 I've only just got it and this one that's been released.

152
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:56,780
 Um, speaking of Pope Benedict, have we spoken about the fact that he released, uh, top,

153
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,340
 he released a Christmas album, didn't he?

154
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,340
 A Christmas music album.

155
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,340
 No.

156
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,780
 And so in 2009, before he resigned, he released a Christmas music album, uh, it was prayers

157
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,660
 set to classical music.

158
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,900
 And it was with Snoop Dogg's record label.

159
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,900
 Wow.

160
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,900
 Yeah.

161
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,900
 Geffen Records.

162
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,740
 Snoop Dogg collaborates with a lot of people like that.

163
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,300
 He didn't, he did a song with Buzz Aldrin.

164
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,300
 A lot of people like the mother.

165
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,300
 Yeah.

166
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,300
 So the Dalai Lada.

167
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:24,700
 No, um, Buzz Aldrin, just like people who are not in music is what I meant.

168
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,700
 Yeah.

169
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,700
 Old people who, yeah.

170
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,220
 He went to Beyond Coronation Street, didn't he?

171
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,220
 The Pope.

172
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,220
 I'll snoop.

173
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,220
 Yeah, does he?

174
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,020
 No, it's not the news a while ago though, he was going to be on Coronation Street, but

175
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,020
 I don't think he ever did.

176
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,380
 I think we would have heard.

177
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,380
 Yeah.

178
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,380
 Yeah.

179
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:44,940
 Um, I was reading that J.K. Rowling's, um, obviously the Philosopher's Stone has released

180
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:45,940
 in Latin.

181
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,940
 Oh, yeah.

182
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,940
 Yeah.

183
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:51,740
 And it, so it's Harry Espotto, uh, is what the book was called, and it was the Philosopher's

184
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,740
 Stone one.

185
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,620
 Um, they also translated it into ancient Greek.

186
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:00,740
 And apparently it's the longest ancient Greek text to have been produced since 3AD.

187
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,740
 Wow.

188
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,740
 Oh, yeah.

189
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,740
 That's amazing.

190
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:08,780
 And also, um, this is interesting.

191
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,860
 The book, the Order of the Phoenix, when that came out.

192
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:16,420
 So just going from the idea that we had three Latin songs in a British chart in France, when

193
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:19,820
 the book came out, they did this thing where they didn't pre-give the book to different

194
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,980
 countries to translate it.

195
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:24,500
 They basically had to wait for the English book to be released, and then they started translating

196
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,500
 the Harry Potter book.

197
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,820
 So it was a big rush to sort of which country could get them quicker for the demand.

198
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:29,820
 Yeah.

199
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,220
 In France, they couldn't wait for the book to be translated.

200
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:37,900
 So Order of the Phoenix is the only non, sorry, non-French book to hit number one in the

201
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:41,260
 French bestseller's list in France as a book.

202
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,260
 That's great.

203
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,780
 Just on the Order of the Phoenix one as well, there was this thing in Venezuela where they

204
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:49,140
 knew the release date was going to be about six months after or five months after the release

205
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,540
 of Order of the Phoenix.

206
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,540
 They couldn't be bothered waiting.

207
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:56,020
 And some guy just translated it on his own and released it and people bought it.

208
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:00,980
 But it, by all accounts, was the worst translation because it's packed with sentences.

209
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,660
 This is a genuine sentence from it.

210
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,980
 Here comes something that I am unable to translate.

211
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,980
 Sorry.

212
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:14,460
 And then later on after another sentence, there's a bracket that said, I'm sorry, I don't understand

213
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,460
 what that means.

214
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,620
 So it's just totally littered with the translator.

215
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,500
 It makes us actually a bit more terrifying.

216
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,700
 If you're describing something, it's like this thing is so awesome, I can't even put it

217
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,700
 into words.

218
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,700
 Yeah.

219
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,700
 It's like another version of Voldemort.

220
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:33,580
 Yeah, I'll be named the literally I can't name it.

221
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,980
 Sorry guys.

222
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:39,740
 Do you guys know the only New York Times bestseller to be written in Latin, bestselling book to be

223
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,740
 written in Latin?

224
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,740
 Oh, no.

225
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,740
 Can you give us a clue?

226
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,740
 Is it Winnie the Pooh?

227
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,740
 Yes, it is.

228
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,740
 Because there was a version of Winnie the Pooh in Latin, wasn't there?

229
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,740
 It's Winnie Ile Pooh.

230
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,740
 Yeah.

231
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,740
 Winnie Ile Pooh.

232
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,060
 It was on the bestseller list for 20 weeks.

233
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,060
 That's pretty good.

234
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,060
 Yeah.

235
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,220
 It's very, I imagine there's not much vocabulary in it.

236
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,340
 So it's probably quite good for teaching children who are learning Latin.

237
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,340
 Yeah.

238
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,340
 It's a Grinch.

239
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:03,460
 So the Doctor's Use, three Doctor's Use books have also been translated into Latin, which

240
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,460
 I would have thought would be...

241
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,460
 Wait, Doctor's Use or Doctor's Use?

242
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,460
 Doctor's Use.

243
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,700
 Because that would be for Greek if anything.

244
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,700
 I don't think...

245
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,780
 I don't think this use was a Doctor.

246
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,780
 I think he had bigger vision of fry.

247
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,100
 Maybe he's medical science as well.

248
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,100
 Doctor's Choice.

249
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,100
 Doctor's Choice.

250
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,100
 But if I said Doctor's Choice, people would call me a dickhead.

251
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,100
 Yeah.

252
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,100
 So I say Doctor's Seuce, then.

253
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,100
 Doctor's Seuce.

254
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,100
 I always say.

255
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,100
 I always say Doctor's Seuce.

256
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,100
 Yeah.

257
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,100
 Yeah.

258
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,260
 So Christmas and two others have been...

259
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:33,340
 In fact, okay, I'll tell you the two others and see if you know what they are.

260
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,780
 I see some of you will.

261
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,060
 Cat us, pet us, at us.

262
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,060
 The cat in the hat.

263
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,060
 Correct.

264
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,500
 And we're at Oua, exclamation mark.

265
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,140
 We're at Perna, two exclamation marks.

266
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,140
 Green eggs, green herm.

267
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,140
 Oh, green eggs in herm.

268
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,140
 Green eggs in herm.

269
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,140
 Green eggs in herm.

270
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,140
 Yeah.

271
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,140
 Very good.

272
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,140
 Study it till the age of 18.

273
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,340
 Still didn't get the cat in the hat one.

274
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,340
 Cat us is a tough one.

275
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,340
 Yeah.

276
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:01,140
 That's what I'm really talking about.

277
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:06,460
 The Latin Wikipedia has 94,000 articles, which is amazing when you think about it.

278
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,460
 Yeah.

279
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,980
 I mean, that's much more than many other languages.

280
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:09,980
 Yeah.

281
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,980
 In fact, I wonder where that features in Wikipedia language are.

282
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:12,980
 Yeah.

283
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,580
 And you can get Facebook in Latin as well.

284
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,580
 Instead of the like button, there's a mihi-plaket button.

285
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,580
 It is pleasing to me.

286
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,580
 It is pleasing to me.

287
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,580
 Yeah.

288
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:29,660
 The other languages that Latin almost, you know, was the Latin tribe was vying with before

289
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,660
 they became the Romans.

290
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:35,420
 You know, when they were just a tiny tribe in southern Italy, there were really cool names

291
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:40,780
 that Wolfskian, Oskan and Falleskin, these were just other languages doing the rounds in

292
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,780
 the area.

293
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,020
 Falleskin sounds like it comes from Falles, doesn't it?

294
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,020
 Yeah, it does.

295
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,020
 It does.

296
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,020
 It does.

297
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,020
 Penis language.

298
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,020
 I'm sure they get a lot of that at school.

299
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:53,620
 Like any more of it for you guys, especially if they lost to the Romans, embarrassing.

300
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:59,100
 Anyway, Germany, I think, is the only country to have had a number one song in Elvish.

301
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,100
 Because--

302
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,100
 Wow.

303
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,100
 A lot of the rings.

304
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,100
 Yeah.

305
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,100
 It was the Anya track.

306
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,100
 Director, producer, promoter, whatever.

307
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,100
 This is called in the business.

308
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:11,740
 Decided that her musical ideas were too complex and interesting to get across in any language

309
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,740
 that existed.

310
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:17,020
 So they wrote a new language for her, in which some of her other songs are sung, which

311
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:21,500
 is called Amaranthine, that's Anya's language, got her own language.

312
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,860
 Hey, now we were talking about dishwasher's earlier.

313
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,860
 Yeah.

314
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:29,860
 The Latin for dishwasher, and obviously we all know in terrible words, but it's something

315
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:35,580
 like Escaraeorium as the first word, something like that, that's not correct, lavatory.

316
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,580
 Oh, yeah.

317
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,580
 Oh, yeah.

318
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,580
 Lavatory's a lavatory.

319
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,580
 That's a lavatory.

320
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,580
 Lavoy is to wash.

321
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,580
 To wash, yeah.

322
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,580
 Yeah.

323
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:47,700
 Lavatory was, I think, an ecclesiastical room for washing in a church or in a monastery or

324
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,700
 that kind of thing.

325
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,900
 Lavatory was the room where you go and have a wash.

326
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:55,020
 Who do you think was the first person who took a poo in there and transformed it?

327
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,020
 I was wrong.

328
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,020
 Oh.

329
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,020
 Father Dave.

330
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,180
 What have you done?

331
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:04,020
 It was time the room branched out.

332
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:07,860
 Do you know if that's what happened with all the words?

333
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,860
 Yes.

334
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,540
 Someone just, like, Dave, father Dave, this used to be a place where we just had a

335
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,540
 bath.

336
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:17,500
 Now the Deficatorium's completely ruined holiday.

337
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:23,900
 Okay, it's time for back number two and that is Chazinski.

338
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:28,820
 My fact is that the way to recognize the Buddha is to look out for his webbed feet, a tongue

339
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:32,180
 that can reach his ears and withdrawn genitalia.

340
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,020
 That's a good excuse on a date.

341
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,020
 No, no.

342
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,020
 It's not small.

343
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,020
 I'm the Buddha.

344
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,020
 I'm the reincarnated Buddha.

345
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,020
 Oh, yeah.

346
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:42,020
 Then show me your tongue, because I can get on board with it.

347
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:57,820
 So, yeah, these are some of the 32, these are three of the 32 lakh sharnas or special bodily

348
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:02,060
 features of the Buddha and they're what proper representation of the Buddha must have that

349
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,060
 make him the perfect being.

350
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:08,820
 So the perfect being has these features as well as various other things like 40 teeth rather

351
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:15,660
 than 32 and ankle bones that are hardly noticeable and an excellent sense of taste.

352
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:20,620
 It is an amazing list of characteristics that the Buddha had, I mean, this is Buddha original

353
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:27,300
 as well, Buddha classic, if you will, had thighs like a royal stag, a ten foot aura and

354
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:36,140
 the area below armpits well filled with hair or yeah, so wait, are there 32 of these?

355
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:39,420
 I don't know what they'll fill with, I think both with flesh maybe.

356
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:43,820
 There's an additional 80 extra little tiny things if you want to look at and what's really

357
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:47,860
 weird is they point out that the extra 80 things are just like, you know, you've confirmed

358
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:52,260
 its Buddha, you know, his tongue can wrap around his ears, he's got these web feet, it's

359
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,020
 definitely Buddha.

360
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:57,620
 But if you just want to make doubly sure that it's him, there's these 80 extra things and

361
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:04,020
 I read through the 80 and they are quite simple, but then one is he can fly.

362
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:07,340
 That feels like it should be the first one, I'd be the first thing I'd ask him, yeah.

363
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:12,020
 And they're so mixed as well, like one of them is he has a protruding nose, number 28 of

364
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:16,220
 the extra 80 and the one before it is, he has the strength of a thousand elephants.

365
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,220
 No, no, he doesn't.

366
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:24,460
 He has a strength of a thousand crore elephants and the crore is 10 million and so he has

367
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,420
 a strength of 10 billion elephants.

368
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,660
 Sorry, that was my mistake.

369
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:31,820
 But I mean, that the Buddha, 10 billion elephants, that's the kind of strength that he's

370
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,820
 put out.

371
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:36,820
 To be fair, once you're strong enough that you can pull 10 elephants, the extra just feels

372
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,820
 like showing off.

373
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,820
 Yeah, you're right.

374
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,980
 Number 75 in this list of 80.

375
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:47,340
 So he is either completely bald or has a full crop of hair.

376
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:50,820
 No, it's between those.

377
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,620
 No, yeah.

378
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:58,340
 So what I like about this list is that it's not only just what he was, but if you were

379
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:04,540
 looking out for Buddha as a reincarnation, these are all the things that he would have still.

380
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:08,140
 And I was looking into reincarnation just generally because we haven't had a reincarnation

381
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,620
 of the Buddha, but we obviously have the Dalai Lama.

382
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,940
 He's a reincarnation of, so he's the 14th, I believe.

383
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:17,020
 He's threatening, and I don't know what the latest update on this is, but he's saying

384
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:21,180
 he might not reincarnate anymore just to stick it to the Chinese.

385
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,180
 Yeah, he's going to put it up.

386
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,180
 He's going to put it up as a vote.

387
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,180
 That is petty.

388
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,100
 He's going to take a vote on it.

389
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:30,220
 But yeah, this is the last, you know, that he may have changed and, you know, how he was speaking

390
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,740
 about it in September last year.

391
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,740
 Yeah, it's very recent.

392
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,740
 Yeah, yeah.

393
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,740
 He might not do it.

394
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,900
 But it's so interesting, the way that they do find the reincarnations.

395
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:44,580
 Did I not like give a child some of the old Dalai Lama's possessions and see if he

396
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,580
 likes them?

397
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:49,180
 Yes, so there were a bunch of possessions that were given to him, and he was picking them

398
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,580
 up saying, oh, this is mine, this is mine.

399
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,580
 It tends to be...

400
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:56,580
 But that's if you give children anything, they say, this is mine, this is mine.

401
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:00,740
 But there was a bunch of things on the ground.

402
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:07,900
 There was a kid who was told that he was a reincarnation of Lama, and it was down to a few things

403
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:16,420
 like he was able to identify the color of the previous Lama's car, and the mileage.

404
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,420
 Yeah.

405
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,420
 What's in the glove box then?

406
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:22,140
 Some tic-tacks and my gun.

407
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:25,740
 The guy who stole my car, we did a deal.

408
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:29,900
 Can I just ask a question about this, right?

409
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:34,220
 So this guy is supposed to be the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama.

410
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,220
 No, no, sorry.

411
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,220
 Of another...

412
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,220
 There are lots of Lama's that you can be.

413
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,220
 Like a punch in Lama or something.

414
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,220
 Yeah, yeah.

415
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:47,220
 So, like, for example, it's been confirmed that Steven Segal is the reincarnation of a 17th

416
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:50,580
 century Buddhist spirit called Chongdrige Dorje.

417
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:55,820
 When you say it is being confirmed by the community of like the Dalai Lama people.

418
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,820
 By evidence, Andy.

419
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,820
 By evidence.

420
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,820
 Sorry.

421
00:16:58,820 --> 00:16:59,820
 Right.

422
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,140
 Yeah, so he's not obviously the Dalai Lama, but he is a...

423
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:06,500
 The China tried to make their own Lama, didn't they?

424
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,260
 I thought it was their own Dalai Lama.

425
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:12,740
 They said, right, okay, the guy that you guys have chosen in Tibet isn't the real one.

426
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,940
 We're going to have a lottery to choose, which is the real one.

427
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:15,940
 Oh, really?

428
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,940
 And they've had a lottery.

429
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:20,260
 Like, they put a load of names in an urn and pulled one out, and it was a child.

430
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,260
 How did that go for them?

431
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,260
 Is he being raised now?

432
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,260
 I think he is, isn't he?

433
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,260
 I think he is.

434
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,260
 I think he is, isn't he?

435
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:28,260
 Could I just mention yogic flying, because I like it.

436
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,260
 Yeah.

437
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,980
 So, you know, there was this big 1950s movement, the Transcendental Meditation movement,

438
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:37,300
 and it was a group of people who took on the idea of the power of the frog, I think it's

439
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,500
 called in Hindu and Buddhist philosophy, and it's the idea that you could reach a state

440
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,220
 of meditation where you can fly.

441
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:46,620
 And the famously, there was the natural law party in the 80s, where they tried to get

442
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:50,220
 into politics, and they would do this for the flying thing.

443
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,220
 Yeah.

444
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,620
 So, it's quite funny, when I think there's video footage of the groups that tried to do it.

445
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:59,140
 The Beatles were quite interested in it, and yogic flying has three stages, and stage

446
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:03,380
 one is hopping, and stage two is floating, and stage three is flying.

447
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,380
 Oh, I can use one of those.

448
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,380
 It's very much...

449
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:09,700
 The key breach point is between one and two, though, isn't it?

450
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,700
 Right.

451
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,700
 So, you've got two.

452
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,700
 Your three is probably going to be fine.

453
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:17,340
 So, the Transcendental Movement itself admits that no one in the modern era has yet

454
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:22,220
 got beyond stage one.

455
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,660
 He's had it, guys.

456
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,060
 Do you guys know, have you guys heard of Druc Parkunli?

457
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,060
 No.

458
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,860
 He was a Buddhist master in the 15th century.

459
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:36,420
 He was the guy who brought Buddhism to Bhutan, and he had pretty wacky methods of enlightening

460
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:39,620
 people and pretty wacky Buddhist practices.

461
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:44,340
 He mainly tried his methods on women, and so he had the title, "The Saint of the 5,000

462
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,340
 Women."

463
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:49,620
 So, the other things women would seek is blessing in the form of sex.

464
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,660
 He's called the Divine Madman, is that the guy?

465
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,980
 He's still called the Divine Madman.

466
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:56,220
 His penis is called the Thunderbolt of Flaming Wisdom, because...

467
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,980
 Yeah, I've been invited by it.

468
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,980
 Oh, you have, haven't you?

469
00:18:58,980 --> 00:18:59,980
 Yeah.

470
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:00,980
 What do you mean?

471
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:01,980
 What?

472
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:08,020
 When I've been to a, what do you call these, like a temple of his, and as you go in there's

473
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:12,460
 a priest with a large wooden phallus, and he sort of puts it on your shoulder, like

474
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:16,700
 writing it like the Queen would, well...

475
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:20,780
 The Queen would, exactly, but then it's supposed to be like a fertility thing.

476
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,780
 God, Boltons changed.

477
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,780
 It's always last there.

478
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,780
 Where is it?

479
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,780
 Where is it in the Bhutan?

480
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,780
 Okay, cool.

481
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,780
 That's an apunachra thing.

482
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,780
 That's amazing.

483
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,780
 That's what he does.

484
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:31,940
 He's been anointed by the phallus of, what is it called, the Thunderbolt of...

485
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,900
 It's the Thunderbolt of Flaming Wisdom.

486
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,780
 It had the power to turn a woman into deities, but I guess that was the real thing.

487
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:38,780
 I don't think James is a god.

488
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:43,660
 But what happens is you walk into this temple and the priest approaches you with a giant

489
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,660
 phallus.

490
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:48,260
 I imagine the first time that happened, it was probably Brother David.

491
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,260
 Exactly.

492
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:54,820
 Well, the houses around here, they paint phalluses on their walls as well.

493
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,820
 Around there.

494
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,820
 Around this area.

495
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,820
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

496
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:03,100
 And this, yeah, if you go around there, there's like shops like that sell like local produce

497
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,500
 and they all have big pictures of penises on the walls.

498
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,740
 You would draw those on walls around near where I live as well, actually, yeah.

499
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,740
 I don't know.

500
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,740
 So you guys were religious comedians?

501
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,740
 You were religious comedians.

502
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,740
 Yeah, apparently.

503
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,740
 On your front door.

504
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,740
 Yeah.

505
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,740
 What a devout place.

506
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,740
 We are.

507
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:23,540
 Maybe that's what the Buddha meant when he says withdrawn genitalia, withdrawn genitalia.

508
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,380
 Oh my goodness.

509
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:27,380
 Oh my goodness.

510
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:31,180

511

 And also if you go to their website and type in the code fish, they'll give you 10% off

521

 your website.

522
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,900
 All right.

523
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,900
 Carry on with the podcast.

524
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,260
 Okay, time for fact number three.

525
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,260
 And that's my fact.

526
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:10,100
 And my fact this week is that the whoopie cushion was invented by Roman Emperor called

527
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,100
 Basie Anus.

528
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:15,500
 Now that is just I've never heard of this emperor.

529
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:21,160
 So the Roman Emperor Ella Gabelus, he is, he's the famous, that's his name, his birth

530
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,220
 name was Basie Anus.

531
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:27,380
 Now I'm sure it might be pronounced Cassianus, sorry like that, but when you read it and you

532
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:31,300
 find out he invented the whoopie cushion, I just don't know how.

533
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,300
 You can't let that go.

534
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,300
 Yeah.

535
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,300
 Basie Anus.

536
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,340
 Well, describe the whoopie cushion.

537
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:41,740
 Well, it was obviously a prototype to what we have now.

538
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:45,220
 He was in development of health in nearly 2000 years.

539
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,220
 prototype.

540
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:52,740
 He just used to bring a cushion that had air in it and he would bring it to his dinner parties.

541
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:56,180
 And he was only 14 or so at the time, he was a very young emperor.

542
00:21:56,180 --> 00:22:02,060
 And it just used to be his little party trick, his little, let out air while he was there.

543
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,740
 That's all we know about it, really, isn't it?

544
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:08,300
 Yeah, it couldn't be rather, it could be rather that they were at a normal height and then

545
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,260
 just got lower and lower and lower as it went on.

546
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:13,700
 I don't know if it made a farting noise, it might have done.

547
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:18,780
 Yeah, I think it's, I mean, any, you know, anything full of air where you've got something

548
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,020
 coming out of a sphincter that it's going to make a noise.

549
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,820
 Yeah, especially because they had to come out slowly, I guess, because they had to sink

550
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,820
 gradually.

551
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,820
 And they would be one of the squeaky farts.

552
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,820
 Yeah.

553
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,820
 But went on forever.

554
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:29,820
 Yeah, yeah.

555
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,820
 All dinner.

556
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,340
 Oh, this is still embarrassing.

557
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:39,820
 Another thing Ella Gabelus did to dinner guests, apparently, is suffocated a bunch of dinner

558
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,500
 guests under loads of rose petals.

559
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,500
 Really?

560
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,500
 He was been rebastered.

561
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,580
 But yeah, I think that was quite an imaginative way to go about murdering your dinner guests

562
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,580
 if you do want to do that.

563
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,580
 That's true.

564
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,580
 Did he mean to you?

565
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,380
 Or was that actually he actually just wanted them to go home?

566
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,380
 It was kind of his way of hinting that it was late.

567
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,380
 He was tired.

568
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,380
 Yeah.

569
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:02,480
 He locked them in a room, didn't he, and they had a fake ceiling, and he dropped out all these

570
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,100
 rose petals, but there were so many of them that they all suffocated.

571
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,700
 But he didn't mean them, too.

572
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,700
 I thought he was trying to kill them.

573
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,020
 Oh, I don't know.

574
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,700
 He was a total dick, though, wasn't he?

575
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,700
 Yeah.

576
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,820
 Like, I don't know much about him, but from what I've read.

577
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,180
 He was a real bassy anor.

578
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,180
 Yeah.

579
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,180
 He was a nice guy.

580
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:22,180
 He had all these, I mean, but it's one of those ones where the stories are like half

581
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,940
 funny, as well as like the bad bits.

582
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:31,860
 Like he kind of just used to go and prostitute himself in bars and dresses a woman, and he purposefully

583
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:35,380
 tried to piss off people so that they would beat him up because he had a bit of a fetish

584
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,620
 about being beat up, and he's a very odd character.

585
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:43,180
 The weirdest thing I read is that he wanted to have his dick chopped off, right?

586
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:46,860
 And so he went to a doctor, and the doctor said, I don't want to do that.

587
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,300
 And he said, no, do it.

588
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,460
 And they apparently they really like thrashed out the conversation.

589
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:55,060
 And the compromise, and this from what I read, they said they compromised on.

590
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,060
 He was circumcised.

591
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,140
 And that's a hell of a compromise.

592
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,140
 That's a huge compromise.

593
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,140
 Yeah.

594
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,140
 That is kind of level one.

595
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,140
 That is kind of level one.

596
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:05,940
 And the few hours of shopping at penis, I'll just take.

597
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:06,940
 Wait.

598
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,140
 What's the third one?

599
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:11,340
 I think the third one is the full shopping.

600
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,340
 Absolutely.

601
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,340
 His total lob off.

602
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,340
 Well, the second one.

603
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,340
 I don't want to know.

604
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,340
 I don't want to know.

605
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,340
 I don't want to know.

606
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,340
 Right.

607
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,340
 Yeah.

608
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,340
 So interesting character.

609
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,340
 Yeah.

610
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:25,980
 And again, it's another thing where just even if it, like for me, the enjoyable thing of the

611
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:30,580
 fact is that he was called Bayceanus, but actually the initial thing of the whoopie cushion

612
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:35,500
 being invented as far back as then is like on a previous podcast when I found out that

613
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,260
 yo-yos were being used from that period as well.

614
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:43,100
 It's so out of place to me to think that a whoopie cushion was that far back in time

615
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,860
 as a practical joke as well.

616
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:45,860
 Yeah.

617
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:49,700
 You know, the whoopie cushion when it had its first 20th century origin wasn't actually

618
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,700
 called a whoopie cushion.

619
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:54,740
 It was called a musical seat in 1926.

620
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,340
 And it didn't really make a fart noise either.

621
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,340
 So it wasn't very good.

622
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,340
 But it didn't make music.

623
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:01,780
 Well, in the catalog it says, sounds like you sat on a cat.

624
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,980
 It made this weird little scream.

625
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:09,740
 It was quite upsetting to hear, apparently, like a screeching cat or a crying child.

626
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:16,460
 And then it was invented and then initially it was called the poo-poo cushion or the boop boop-a-dupe.

627
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,780
 These are not good names.

628
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:21,820
 But when they hit on the name whoopie cushion which was only in 1932, that was after the slang

629
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:25,460
 term whoopie, making whoopie is a slang term for having sex.

630
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,060
 So the whoopie cushion is named after sex.

631
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,220
 So it was a sex cushioned.

632
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,220
 So who made that connection?

633
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,220
 That was useful.

634
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,220
 Yeah.

635
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:35,220
 Well, there was a hit song in 1928 called Making Whoopie.

636
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,220
 Yeah.

637
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,220
 And I think who's called the whoopie cushion a few years later?

638
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:43,060
 Well, I think whoopie then became just having fun on that and then became lighter.

639
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,500
 That makes more sense.

640
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:51,340
 So Soren Sorenson Adams, who was a very famous joke developer, the SS Adams code, loads

641
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:57,300
 of stuff like the insect in an ice cube and the flower that squirts stuff out.

642
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,500
 Yeah, all of these really classic jokes, a lot of them were invented by him.

643
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,500
 Wow.

644
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:05,180
 But he turned down the whoopie cushion initially because he thought it was indelicate.

645
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:08,820
 And then he realized this mistake soon after it was, you know, to become a big success.

646
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,580
 And he made his own one, which was called the raspberry cushioned.

647
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,580
 Okay.

648
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,580
 Yeah.

649
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:16,620
 But he also invented the joy buzzer, which is the hand buzzer.

650
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,620
 Exactly.

651
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,620
 Yeah.

652
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,620
 Okay.

653
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:22,220
 You know, when you shake hands with someone and there's a buzzer and it's a little electric

654
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,220
 shock or something.

655
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,900
 It's actually just a vibration, isn't it?

656
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,900
 That's it.

657
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,900
 Yeah.

658
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:27,900
 But I just want to read you this.

659
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:31,940
 It was modeled after another product, the zapper, which was similar to the joy buzzer,

660
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:36,740
 did not have a very effective buzz and contained a button that had a blunt point that would hurt

661
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,940
 the person whose hand was shaken.

662
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:43,180
 So just a mini knife, basically.

663
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:45,420
 It's just got you really good with that one.

664
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,940
 Yeah, I'll get the managers, yeah, yeah.

665
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:47,940
 It was funny, Brian.

666
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,980
 I just stabbed you in the chest.

667
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,860
 Now, just stand underneath all these rose petals.

668
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,860
 Yeah.

669
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,260
 And take a smell of my flower.

670
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,580
 It's a gum.

671
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:03,140
 So Sir Vincent Adams, he started off with itching powder, no sneezing powder, no sneezing

672
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,140
 powder.

673
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,140
 Okay, yeah.

674
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:09,540
 And he worked for a company that made this, whatever product it was.

675
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:13,540
 And they had this dustless left over from the product and he noticed that people were sneezing

676
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,540
 from it.

677
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:18,500
 And so then he thought, oh, this is a great prank I can make this and sell it.

678
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:23,340
 And he started selling loads and loads of the sneezing powder and became really big.

679
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,860
 It was called Kachoo.

680
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:31,340
 And his first year, he sold $15,000 worth, but 25 years later the FDA banned it as a toxic

681
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,340
 substance.

682
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:35,780
 So for all that time, he'd be poisoning people as well as making them sneeze.

683
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,780
 Oh, wow.

684
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,780
 It was genuinely toxic.

685
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,780
 Yeah.

686
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:39,780
 No, that's quite funny.

687
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:40,780
 That is health and safety gone mad.

688
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:43,100
 Another thing they used was itching powder, wasn't it, in World War II?

689
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,100
 Okay.

690
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:48,140
 And it came, there was an idea to plant itching powder on Nazis in various ways.

691
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:51,820
 And on the, on the like instructions that were given to people who were trying to infiltrate

692
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:54,820
 and plant this, it said, the greatest effect is produced by a plant.

693
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:58,540
 Find the powder to the inside of the underclothing, so I don't know how it was intended.

694
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,540
 I'll do it.

695
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,540
 Wow.

696
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,540
 Yeah, exactly.

697
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:04,380
 I think when they were pitching that in the meeting, they said, okay, so let me get this right.

698
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,380
 You've made it right up to a Nazi.

699
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:09,300
 You got your gun in here.

700
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,300
 Okay.

701
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:15,740
 So now I want you to take out the gun and just use it to apply a bit of the itching powder

702
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,820
 to his underclothes.

703
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,140
 Be careful.

704
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:22,820
 In World War I, they had sneezing powder, the Germans, this is.

705
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,700
 And it didn't do you that much harm.

706
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:28,860
 Apart from, it made you sneeze, so it made you take off your gas mask and then they'd be

707
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,860
 able to get you with the other stuff.

708
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:31,860
 Cheeky.

709
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,860
 Wow.

710
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:33,860
 Okay.

711
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,860
 Why don't you take off your gas mask when he sneezes?

712
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:39,220
 You don't want to get spit when I think it was like, it would kind of just get in the

713
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:42,380
 eyes and in the nose and stuff, they just need a fresher.

714
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,380
 Okay.

715
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,380
 Okay.

716
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,380
 Wow.

717
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:48,780
 The man who invented the fart machine, much later than the whoopee cushion.

718
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:53,100
 He tried to record the sounds with his friend, his name was Fred Jarrow and his, he and his friend

719
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,500
 John Blackman, who was developing it.

720
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:58,980
 They tried to record it by going into a recording studio after having eaten lots of fart-causing

721
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,620
 food like cabbage and beans and things and they said it didn't work.

722
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,620
 They didn't sound right.

723
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,620
 Yeah.

724
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:06,100
 What did the people around them say?

725
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,620
 You're never using us recording studio again.

726
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,620
 What did they use in the end for the sounds?

727
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,620
 Synthesizer.

728
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,620
 Oh.

729
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,620
 Wow.

730
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,620
 Wow.

731
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,620
 Okay.

732
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,620
 Oh yeah.

733
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,620
 Like, my old Yamaha didn't have a fart button.

734
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:20,020
 So like, is that, have I just not understanding how synthesizers work?

735
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,020
 I don't know.

736
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:25,660
 So here's the thing, a synthesizer uses recordings of sounds that it does at least.

737
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,860
 So it must have got it from somewhere else originally.

738
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,860
 Yeah.

739
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:29,860
 All right.

740
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:30,860
 I don't know the full details on this one.

741
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,860
 I'm going to fess up.

742
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:35,860
 I think they use, I think they used existing sounds and slowed them down and sped them up.

743
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,860
 Oh yeah.

744
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:37,860
 Made them.

745
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,860
 Okay.

746
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:39,860
 Yeah.

747
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:40,860
 Yeah.

748
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,860
 Okay.

749
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:42,860
 That makes sense.

750
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,860
 Yeah.

751
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:46,740
 One more prankster was Jim Moran in America who was born in 1970.

752
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,900
 He lived until 1999.

753
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,460
 He was called America's number one prankster.

754
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:56,740
 And he did lots of, you know, fun, crazy pranks like he walked a bull through a China shot

755
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,420
 once and he did this kind of thing.

756
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:03,420
 He also looked for a needle in a haystack in 1939 and it took him 82 hours before he found

757
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,420
 it.

758
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,420
 Yeah.

759
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,420
 But who's that a Joe Khan?

760
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,420
 No, yeah.

761
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,420
 Of himself, isn't it?

762
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,620
 It was near the bottom and slightly to the left of center.

763
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:13,140
 But this, I love so much about it.

764
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:17,980
 Pranks does try to set fire to the haystack five times while he was in it.

765
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:18,980
 Out pranking the prankster.

766
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,140
 Judges on him.

767
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:23,580
 - Klinger. - Why do you?

768
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,340
 - How do you fail to light?

769
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:27,860
 - It's good for him. - Hey.

770
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,380
 - Well, you know the saying, is it like, what?

771
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,940
 - It's like, trying to say, fire to a haze there.

772
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,660
 - How do you know the needle was in there?

773
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,420
 - I think he put it in there. - Was he just like

774
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,180
 fingers crossed? Okay, he definitely,

775
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,620
 so if he put it there.

776
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,220
 (laughing)

777
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,260
 - That's a very good point.

778
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:43,340
 - Well, he must have thrown it in and then it must have fallen.

779
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,580
 - No, I think he would've got a friend to put it in there.

780
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:48,460
 - Yeah, yeah. - I'm amazed he had friends.

781
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,540
 (laughing)

782
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:58,060
 - Okay, time for our final fact of the show.

783
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,660
 And that is James.

784
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:03,140
 - Okay, my fact this week is that

785
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:08,140
 the oldest known purse is decorated with dog's teeth.

786
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:12,740
 - Okay. - So he's very old bling.

787
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:17,740
 This is found in a grave dated to 2,500 BC.

788
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:23,060
 And it was a leather pouch decorated with dog's teeth

789
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,580
 in a nice little pattern.

790
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,740
 But over the years, the leather has disappeared

791
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,660
 so that all was left was the teeth.

792
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,500
 - Cool.

793
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,860
 - But they've kind of worked out that it must have been,

794
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:32,980
 must have been the purse.

795
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,180
 - Rather than a dog.

796
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,900
 (laughing)

797
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,180
 - He was decorated in the shape of the dog's mouth.

798
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,980
 (laughing)

799
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:44,940
 And next to it was like a bum bag with decorated with dogs.

800
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:45,780
 - Skellison.

801
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:48,380
 (laughing)

802
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,500
 - Yeah, that's really interesting.

803
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,300
 I guess they use what they could find.

804
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,140
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

805
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,620
 - What were they carrying back then?

806
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,540
 - I don't know, really.

807
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,460
 If you would carry, let's say you'd carry

808
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,460
 - More dogs' teeth.

809
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,820
 (laughing)

810
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:00,660
 - They meant the purse.

811
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,940
 - Something valuable or some food

812
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:04,380
 or some, you know, a tool or something.

813
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,220
 - Yeah.

814
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:08,620
 - And so this is according to Harold Stalbel,

815
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:11,580
 the senior archaeologist at Germany's Saxon State

816
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,300
 Archaeology Office.

817
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,260
 And he thinks that it was very fashionable at the time

818
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:18,380
 to decorate these handbags with dogs' teeth

819
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:21,260
 'cause he says that not everyone was buried with them.

820
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,980
 It was only people of high status.

821
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:23,820
 - Right.

822
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,820
 - So it must have been quite good.

823
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:28,380
 - High status people who are catching dogs.

824
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,220
 - Yeah.

825
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,060
 - Maybe that was a sign of yours.

826
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,820
 I mean, what meant high status 3,000 years ago?

827
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,980
 - Yeah, we're, what, like, civilization

828
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,020
 are we talking about?

829
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,340
 - What's wrong with stone age?

830
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,180
 - Bronze age. - Yeah.

831
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,700
 - Bronze age.

832
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,860
 - I do like that we've, humans have wanted to

833
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,660
 adorn ourselves since, as long as we know,

834
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,580
 they've existed, basically.

835
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,860
 And we've just fine, fine, all the kids.

836
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,780
 - Yeah, and the cells as well, didn't they?

837
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,740
 They had, like, little trinkets and stuff

838
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,660
 they were buried with.

839
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:53,500
 - Yeah.

840
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,700
 Like, I think that oldest, I think maybe until 2006,

841
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,700
 the oldest jewelry we had was snail shells, weren't they?

842
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:03,500
 From about 75, I wanna say 75,000 years ago.

843
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:07,180
 And we found them in a cave in South Africa.

844
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,660
 And it was just, like, little holes drilled in snail shells,

845
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,820
 which they think they used to hook them into their,

846
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,220
 some bit of their body.

847
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,460
 - In the Bible, Judas is specifically identified

848
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,300
 as the guy who was carrying the purse.

849
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,140
 - See?

850
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:18,980
 - Yeah.

851
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,460
 - Well, he was given money in the purse.

852
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,300
 Wasn't he, he was given 30 pieces of silver

853
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,420
 in that's true purse.

854
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,700
 - I thought that was, what was the name?

855
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,180
 - His name.

856
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,020
 - Sorry, gone.

857
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:31,580
 - Well, he took, if Jesus was given anything.

858
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:34,540
 So it says in John's Gospel, Judas had the purse into which

859
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,740
 was put whatsoever was ministered to Christ.

860
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,420
 So he was the banker.

861
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,300
 As always, when playing monopoly, as in the Bible,

862
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,860
 don't trust the banker.

863
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:46,380
 (all laughing)

864
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,340
 - He's cheated.

865
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,540
 - That'd be a good action version of monopoly.

866
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,700
 - Yeah, well, you have to betray one of them,

867
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,820
 one of the other players who's then crucified.

868
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,860
 (all laughing)

869
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,060
 - That must be why, so Judas is scarier.

870
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:01,020
 The name is scarier, it comes from the Latin score tear,

871
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:03,860
 which is a purse or a bag used to carry money.

872
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:04,700
 - Yeah.

873
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,740
 - So maybe that's why the word scrotum comes from.

874
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,940
 - I wonder.

875
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:08,780
 - I bet it is.

876
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,220
 - So was he Mr. Moneybags?

877
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,500
 - I guess he was Mr. Moneybags.

878
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,500
 - Oh, Mr. Scrotum.

879
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,780
 (all laughing)

880
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,180
 - No one, he was resentful.

881
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,780
 - Guys, it means moneybags.

882
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,860
 (all laughing)

883
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:21,660
 - You'll see, you'll see, yeah, yeah, Judas.

884
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,660
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, Scrotum.

885
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:26,500
 - Well, Scrotum's have been used as purses.

886
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,340
 - Perfect.

887
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,100
 - Well, they use them, like in Australia,

888
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,500
 you can buy like kangaroo scrotum.

889
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,340
 - Oh, yeah.

890
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,820
 - Oh, that's right, that's really big at the moment.

891
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,100
 - Yeah, it is, yeah.

892
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:38,540
 - Apparently the best one is a W-shaped kangaroo scrotum purse.

893
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:41,620
 And that is kind of, if you can imagine the two bits

894
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:44,460
 of the testicles go, rather than being attached

895
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:48,620
 like webtoes might be, they're kind of more like a W-shaped.

896
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,940
 - Is that so you can keep different things

897
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:50,780
 in the different--

898
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,940
 - I think it's just 'cause they're rare.

899
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:55,540
 It's like one in 10,000 kangaroo scrotums shaped like this.

900
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:58,700
 - It's like a lucky folly clover, except for the kangaroo.

901
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:01,060
 (all laughing)

902
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:04,300
 - Speaking of designer, handbags and stuff like that,

903
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:10,260
 women's bags are much more expensive than men's bags

904
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,660
 no matter what they look like or anything.

905
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:16,260
 So there was, there's a purse blog run by someone

906
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,660
 called Amanda Moll, and she looked at all the different things

907
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:22,140
 that you could buy, and she found that for two bags,

908
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:25,260
 which are virtually identical, one for women and one for men.

909
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:28,380
 The woman's won cost $2.96 a cubic inch,

910
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:31,700
 and the men's won cost $1.54 a cubic inch,

911
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,020
 and they're pretty much identical, so the idea is basically

912
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,420
 to just charge Mark as it's same little woman.

913
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:40,980
 - So on designer bags, Louis Vuitton apparently burns

914
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,180
 all of his bags that he's made that year,

915
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:45,900
 not him personally, he gets someone to burn,

916
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:46,940
 all the bags he's made that year,

917
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,740
 so that they don't get sold on the cheap,

918
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:51,100
 the next year 'cause it devalues the items.

919
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,140
 - Wow, so all the ones that have been sold

920
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:53,980
 in the shop say--

921
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:56,460
 - So first of all, they have an in-house private Louis Vuitton

922
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,740
 sale for Louis Vuitton staff,

923
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,860
 so people can buy, like, slightly reduced price,

924
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:02,220
 and then, but they keep tabs on who's bought them,

925
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,060
 so they can track them.

926
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,620
 So if one of them appears on eBay,

927
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,740
 Louis's gonna be like, "You put this on eBay,

928
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,580
 that's not cool."

929
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,340
 So you can give one as a gift, I think,

930
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,460
 and then he burns all the rest.

931
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,900
 Make sure it doesn't devalue the brand.

932
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,020
 - That is insane.

933
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:13,860
 - He's pretty mental.

934
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:14,860
 - Yeah, that would have been awesome.

935
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,820
 - That's why he's never made anything of himself.

936
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,620
 (laughing)

937
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,060
 - Are there any other careers in which he would just

938
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:22,460
 set fire to all your stuff at the end of the--

939
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,740
 - Well, it kind of reminds me a bit,

940
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:26,340
 not setting fire to it, but a bit like what DeBears did

941
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:28,780
 with diamonds in that they deliberately don't sell them

942
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:29,860
 to keep the prices high.

943
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:30,700
 - Yeah.

944
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,300
 - And grain, I mean, it's the same thing with grain, isn't it?

945
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,260
 Just stop grain prices from going nuts.

946
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,540
 I'm not very good at understanding this.

947
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,860
 Don't we have huge stocks of grain

948
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:38,860
 that go across and every year?

949
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:42,020
 - I like bottom mountains and all that kind of thing.

950
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,540
 - There is a new year's ritual somewhere

951
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:47,740
 where you write down that you make little pieces

952
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,380
 of paper sculpture, basically,

953
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,260
 on which you have already written things

954
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,780
 that you didn't really enjoy about last year,

955
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,020
 and then you set fire to them on midnight.

956
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:54,860
 It's quite fun.

957
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:55,700
 I've tried that one, yeah.

958
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,540
 - Did you?

959
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:58,020
 - Yeah, set fire to the house.

960
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,980
 It was so much that you were unhappy with.

961
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:00,980
 - Yeah.

962
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:03,380
 So the year always begins with a big insurance claim.

963
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,460
 (laughing)

964
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:08,100
 - Emma, that's the first item in the next year's list.

965
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,220
 - That's a thing in China as well,

966
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,780
 that you write down a confession,

967
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,420
 and you do on three separate bits of paper,

968
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,860
 and then you like the confession up,

969
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:18,220
 and it's a way of almost a priest saying that you can do it.

970
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:20,660
 - That must be bad if your lighter runs out

971
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,660
 and you've written something really darkly on the piece

972
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:26,340
 of paper like, "Oh my god, oh god, oh god."

973
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,380
 - Is there a reason why it's three, DeBears?

974
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,940
 - I'm not sure I saw it on the Carl Pilkington idiot

975
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:31,780
 of Broadway.

976
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,380
 - Oh my gosh, it was because you grew up in China.

977
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,540
 (laughing)

978
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,220
 - You know the hamburger originally meant

979
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,140
 a bit of luggage for a man.

980
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:41,340
 The original hamburger is worth a man.

981
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,180
 - Yeah.

982
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:45,100
 - And then it only became a women's specific item

983
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,020
 in 1841, I think, didn't it?

984
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:47,980
 - Yeah, it's really recent.

985
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,820
 - And do you know who invented it?

986
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:50,980
 The guy who invented the hamburger

987
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:53,140
 also invented butterscotch.

988
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,860
 - Samil Parkinson.

989
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:55,700
 - Yeah.

990
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,900
 - That is two cool things to invent, isn't it?

991
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,740
 - Yeah.

992
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,580
 - Yeah, it is cool.

993
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,460
 So he came in donkaster, it's from donkaster.

994
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,460
 Well done donkaster.

995
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,300
 - Is it?

996
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,140
 - What about donkaster?

997
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:04,980
 - It's from donkaster.

998
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:05,820
 - Yeah.

999
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:06,660
 - Well done.

1000
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,660
 - And yeah, so he introduced handbags

1001
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,780
 as a women's item, specific women's item

1002
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,700
 because before women only had those reticules

1003
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,300
 which are like those tiny drawstring bags

1004
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,780
 that you could basically fit an earring in.

1005
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,460
 And he said to you wrote to a designer

1006
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,940
 and was like, "My wife needs to travel on a train."

1007
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:21,580
 - My wife from donkaster.

1008
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:22,580
 (laughing)

1009
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,700
 - So I looked up a few of the oldest things

1010
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:27,220
 that we know of in particular different fields.

1011
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,060
 - Okay.

1012
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,740
 - So the oldest copy of a gospel

1013
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,180
 was found inside the mask of a mummy.

1014
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,180
 - Oh.

1015
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,020
 - Wasn't that really recent?

1016
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:34,860
 - Wow.

1017
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:35,700
 - That was really recent.

1018
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:36,540
 - Yeah, it was discovered.

1019
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,700
 And it was basically, they made all these things out,

1020
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,820
 it was made out of papyrus,

1021
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,980
 which was then basically turned into papier mache.

1022
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:44,780
 And all kinds of different things were used,

1023
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,460
 all kinds of texts were used to make mummy's masks.

1024
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:49,820
 So there were business papers and just personal letters

1025
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:51,820
 or biblical documents like the early gospel.

1026
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,820
 - Do you think it was for something for them to read?

1027
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,660
 (laughing)

1028
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,780
 - Yeah, it was the Google Glass of its day.

1029
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,780
 (laughing)

1030
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,140
 - Oh, that would be awful.

1031
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,700
 I'm getting so tired of this.

1032
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,140
 - Yeah, and then you were in the beginning, yeah.

1033
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,740
 - Will somebody turn the page?

1034
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:09,500
 (laughing)

1035
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,340
 - Sorry, go on.

1036
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:13,260
 - And so Greek texts, things like "Home is Odyssey"

1037
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:17,220
 would be used as the contents of a papier mache,

1038
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,620
 papyrus mask.

1039
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,460
 - Wow.

1040
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,300
 - That's so strange.

1041
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,140
 Are you never think of that?

1042
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:21,980
 - No.

1043
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:22,820
 - What did they make it out of?

1044
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,660
 - Yeah.

1045
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,500
 - Yeah, that's really cool.

1046
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,540
 - The paper, it seems, they just use it.

1047
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,060
 - They can read it now by taking the mask apart.

1048
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:32,060
 - It's like, today's headlines are tomorrow's papier mache

1049
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,060
 mummy masks.

1050
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,260
 (laughing)

1051
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,980
 It's probably a saying in those days.

1052
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,180
 - Yeah, and when you go to the fish and chip shop,

1053
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,980
 they give you a mummy's mask, we use it out.

1054
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:41,260
 (laughing)

1055
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:45,340
 - The world's oldest human footprints outside Africa.

1056
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,740
 - Anyone guesses on where they are?

1057
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:47,580
 - Yeah, they're in there.

1058
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:48,940
 - Just on the board and leaving Africa.

1059
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:51,220
 (laughing)

1060
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,340
 - They're on a beach in England.

1061
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,860
 - Yeah, they're in Norfolk.

1062
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:57,860
 - Hang on, they're on a beach

1063
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:00,060
 that what the tide just never came in and washed them away.

1064
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:02,260
 - Basically, they, it's quite tricky.

1065
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,420
 They were indentations in the,

1066
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:08,740
 not in the rock, but in the, it's--

1067
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:09,900
 - Sand.

1068
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:10,740
 - Yeah, it's not in the beach.

1069
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:13,020
 - It's not like the beach in the water is just misty.

1070
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:13,860
 (laughing)

1071
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:14,860
 - Yeah, it's eight millions of you.

1072
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,820
 (laughing)

1073
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:17,660
 - No, it's really hard.

1074
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,980
 I read an entire article about this and it's kind of vague,

1075
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,340
 but they were on the beach.

1076
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,580
 They have now been washed away,

1077
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:25,500
 but they were indentations in the beach somehow,

1078
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,140
 which resembled footprints.

1079
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,900
 I have no idea how they dated them as well,

1080
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:29,740
 but they are--

1081
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,980
 - 800,000 years old, that's the amazing thing.

1082
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:34,300
 - I thought it was basically the idea of mud

1083
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,100
 and then the mud dried and kept them

1084
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,140
 and then a beach, what they discovered was the sand

1085
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,260
 on the beach kind of disappeared and revealed them.

1086
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,900
 - Yes, that is exactly it.

1087
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:47,260
 - 800,000, that is amazing.

1088
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:50,860
 - But the replaces in the UK where you can see footprints

1089
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:53,300
 of dinosaurs in the same way, which have been like

1090
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,220
 whether they are muds hardened.

1091
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,620
 - It's amazing. - It's amazing.

1092
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,900
 It's so cool.

1093
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,260
 And they only had a very short space of time

1094
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:03,500
 to get imprints of these before they were washed away

1095
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:06,300
 by rain and by the effects of the waves.

1096
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,820
 And there was one adult and five children with him.

1097
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,900
 That's all we know about these footprints,

1098
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,020
 this family or whoever it was.

1099
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,580
 Yeah. - How cool is that?

1100
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:15,420
 - It is good.

1101
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:17,860
 - So Dog's teeth were used as currency

1102
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:21,140
 in Papua New Guinea until as recently as 1960.

1103
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:24,420
 - What? - Yeah, that's amazing.

1104
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:29,420
 - In 1876, we know what you could get for so many teeth.

1105
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:32,820
 You could get a bride for a hundred dogs teeth.

1106
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,740
 That was like the price of a dowry.

1107
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:35,980
 - Wow.

1108
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:38,300
 - I don't really, like there's not many there

1109
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:41,460
 or I don't know really.

1110
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:44,460
 I guess. - 'Cause if you're going out for dinner

1111
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,780
 and you're going, oh, we should probably pick up

1112
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:50,820
 a built-inite, how many dog teeth should we bring?

1113
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:53,540
 Should we bring Rover with us in just in case?

1114
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,860
 Like could you, was it special type of teeth?

1115
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:58,220
 - What I think it is, and I might be wrong about this,

1116
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,100
 but teeth have been, and animal bonds,

1117
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:04,180
 especially been used forever as things to like cut

1118
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:06,500
 or to, you know, they're useful tools

1119
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,540
 'cause they're hard and you can do things.

1120
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,780
 So I reckon it's quite often currencies

1121
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,740
 are made out of things that are useful

1122
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:14,700
 and then they trade them and then they become a currency.

1123
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:15,980
 So I bet it's probably something like that.

1124
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,020
 - Okay, that's interesting.

1125
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:19,660
 - Although when you say a hundred dog's teeth,

1126
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,060
 that is ambiguous.

1127
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,740
 Is it the teeth of a hundred dogs?

1128
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:23,580
 - Oh no.

1129
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,420
 - Or is it a hundred teeth?

1130
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,260
 - What is the apostrophe in that?

1131
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,800
 - What is the apostrophe?

1132
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,180
 - Yeah, no, it's a hundred teeth.

1133
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,020
 - A hundred teeth.

1134
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:30,860
 - That come from dogs.

1135
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:32,900
 - So you don't want to accidentally murder a hundred dogs

1136
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,420
 and realize you only need to do three or something.

1137
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,700
 - Darling, we're rich.

1138
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:40,220
 (all laughing)

1139
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:41,060
 - That's great.

1140
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,060
 - Have we got any more?

1141
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:42,900
 Should we wrap up?

1142
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:43,740
 - Yeah, I've done.

1143
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,660
 - Oldest penis.

1144
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:50,580
 In the world, the oldest penis is a hundred million years old.

1145
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:51,420
 - What?

1146
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,020
 - Is it a penis for dinosaurs?

1147
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:55,820
 - It belonged to an ostracod,

1148
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,860
 which is an early kind of crustacean

1149
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:59,260
 and it was found on a fossil of that

1150
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:01,420
 and some scientists found it

1151
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,900
 and they analyzed it.

1152
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,500
 One of them was Professor David Siviter

1153
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,900
 of the University of Leicester

1154
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:07,540
 and it was on a tiny marine creature

1155
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:09,180
 which was about one millimeter wide.

1156
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,340
 I'm not sure whether that was the penis

1157
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:11,580
 or the whole animal.

1158
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:15,580
 But the one millimeter penis on the...

1159
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:16,420
 - Oh my God.

1160
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:18,820
 - It was drawn, it was the butter.

1161
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:21,740
 (all laughing)

1162
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:24,820
 But he says that it doesn't have one penis, it has two.

1163
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:26,980
 So the earliest ever penis that we've got

1164
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:28,300
 is from an animal which had two of them.

1165
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:29,820
 - Wow.

1166
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:30,660
 - That's great.

1167
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:31,500
 - That's cool.

1168
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:32,500
 - Yeah.

1169
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:33,340
 - Nice.

1170
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:34,180
 - I like it.

1171
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:35,020
 - Yeah, me too.

1172
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:35,860
 - I'll show you wrap up.

1173
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:37,300
 (upbeat music)

1174
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,140
 - Okay, that's it.

1175
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:39,020
 That's all of our facts.

1176
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:40,060
