00:00:00,00:00:04,They don't want to get away from me?
00:00:04,00:00:15,"Hello and welcome to another episode of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"" a weekly podcast"
00:00:15,00:00:17,coming to you from the QI offices in Covern Garden.
00:00:17,00:00:22,"My name is Dan Schreiber sitting here with Andy Murray, Anichezinski and James Harkin."
00:00:22,00:00:25,Once again we've gathered around the microphone with our fourth favorite facts from the last
00:00:25,00:00:29,"seven days and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:29,00:00:33,"And with fact number one, Andy Hunter Murray."
00:00:33,00:00:36,"My fact is that there have been three top 50 songs in the British charts, which have"
00:00:36,00:00:38,been sung exclusively in Latin.
00:00:38,00:00:40,"Wow, I bet you won all three of them though."
00:00:40,00:00:41,"Yeah, I do."
00:00:41,00:00:45,Just a mix tape of three Latin songs.
00:00:45,00:00:50,"Yeah, one of them actually made it into the Alan Partridge movie last year, yeah, yeah,"
00:00:50,00:00:54,"which was a Gaudette by Steele Iceman, which is a religious, unfortunately they're all"
00:00:54,00:00:59,a bit religious rather than an abyss song which they just happened to fancy doing in Latin.
00:00:59,00:01:04,I didn't know we got religious songs in our pop chart and our top 40 track of the pop.
00:01:04,00:01:05,Yeah.
00:01:05,00:01:07,They're just choirs.
00:01:07,00:01:08,Constantly.
00:01:08,00:01:13,"Anyway, the other one was from Avita in 1976, which is choral in Latin, another was a recording"
00:01:13,00:01:17,of PA Jesus from Andrew Lloyd Webber's Requiem.
00:01:17,00:01:18,That's fantastic song.
00:01:18,00:01:19,Right.
00:01:19,00:01:21,"So two of these are, and is the other one from Avita, you said?"
00:01:21,00:01:22,Yes.
00:01:22,00:01:23,So two of them are Andrew Lloyd Webber songs.
00:01:23,00:01:27,"Two of the three Latin songs are Andrew Lloyd Webber, right?"
00:01:27,00:01:29,Avita being an Andrew Lloyd Webber.
00:01:29,00:01:30,Yeah.
00:01:30,00:01:31,Yeah.
00:01:31,00:01:32,So there you go.
00:01:32,00:01:33,Well done.
00:01:33,00:01:34,Well done Drew.
00:01:34,00:01:36,"So yeah, it's just interesting the sort of the things that get into the pop charts over"
00:01:36,00:01:37,the years.
00:01:37,00:01:38,Yeah.
00:01:38,00:01:39,Yeah.
00:01:39,00:01:42,"And it was, it's easy and now to get things in the pop charts because you can just, everyone"
00:01:42,00:01:45,can download something at the same time and then it can get in the charts.
00:01:45,00:01:49,Whereas in the olden days you actually had to release a record or a CD or something for
00:01:49,00:01:53,it to get in the charts because these days you could get a very popular person on the
00:01:53,00:01:56,radio saying everyone download a Latin song and it would just get in the charts.
00:01:56,00:01:57,"Yeah, you're right."
00:01:57,00:02:01,It doesn't need to be the Taylor Swift album that came out last year.
00:02:01,00:02:07,"They accidentally on the iTunes downloads included a track, just of white noise."
00:02:07,00:02:10,"And because it just went viral, everyone bought it and it went to the top of the charts"
00:02:10,00:02:11,in Canada.
00:02:11,00:02:12,That's right.
00:02:12,00:02:13,Every other pure white.
00:02:13,00:02:15,It must have been so angry.
00:02:15,00:02:16,Yeah.
00:02:16,00:02:17,Aladdin's bar is set going.
00:02:17,00:02:18,This is ironic.
00:02:18,00:02:26,"So, do you know that the Mel Gibson film The Passion was in a mix of Aramaic and Latin?"
00:02:26,00:02:27,Yeah.
00:02:27,00:02:31,It turns out that the Latin that they used in The Passion of the Christ is church Latin
00:02:31,00:02:36,and not classical Latin which means the entire thing is an anachronism.
00:02:36,00:02:37,That's funny.
00:02:37,00:02:38,"I'm really, really pleased by that."
00:02:38,00:02:40,They pronounce their visas W's.
00:02:40,00:02:41,I don't know.
00:02:41,00:02:44,I don't know how much we do know about the pronunciation of classical Latin.
00:02:44,00:02:49,"I think the journal content is the classical Latin, it was pronounced as a W and then church"
00:02:49,00:02:50,"Latin, it's a V."
00:02:50,00:02:51,And if they screwed that up.
00:02:51,00:02:52,Wow.
00:02:52,00:02:53,They fell at the first hurdle.
00:02:53,00:02:54,Yeah.
00:02:54,00:03:01,"So, some of them chart trivia, which day of the week has had the most songs written about"
00:03:01,00:03:02,it.
00:03:02,00:03:03,"So, it's in the title."
00:03:03,00:03:04,"Oh, okay."
00:03:04,00:03:05,Monday.
00:03:05,00:03:06,Yeah.
00:03:06,00:03:07,Monday.
00:03:07,00:03:08,"Yeah, obviously."
00:03:08,00:03:09,I want to go with Friday.
00:03:09,00:03:10,"Oh, well, you're all wrong."
00:03:10,00:03:17,"It's Sunday, 30 songs with the word Sunday and so 30 songs with Sunday and 23 with Saturday"
00:03:17,00:03:20,"11 with Friday, which is a third and only one song."
00:03:20,00:03:24,This is in the billboard charts has ever been written with the word Thursday in the title.
00:03:24,00:03:25,You won.
00:03:25,00:03:26,Yeah.
00:03:26,00:03:29,Sweet Thursday by Johnny Mathis in 1962.
00:03:29,00:03:32,"Okay, this is my favorite fact about the charts."
00:03:32,00:03:33,Okay.
00:03:33,00:03:39,It is that Paul McCartney has had 200 songs in the charts.
00:03:39,00:03:44,"So either Beatles songs, Wingsong, Solo songs, songs are these written for other people."
00:03:44,00:03:50,If you take the amount of time and accumulate all the time that those 200 songs have spent
00:03:50,00:03:52,"in the charts, they add up to 32 years."
00:03:52,00:03:53,Right.
00:03:53,00:03:54,That's amazing.
00:03:54,00:03:55,Oh.
00:03:55,00:04:02,He's had songs in the charts that are for a longer period than I've been alive by two years.
00:04:02,00:04:03,That's pretty good.
00:04:03,00:04:04,That's insane.
00:04:04,00:04:06,And do you know who I found out that fact from?
00:04:06,00:04:07,Who?
00:04:07,00:04:08,President Obama.
00:04:08,00:04:09,Wow.
00:04:09,00:04:11,President Obama just tweeting factoids.
00:04:11,00:04:12,"Yeah, he's going."
00:04:12,00:04:13,"Yeah, he runs OMG."
00:04:13,00:04:14,They've just signed them up.
00:04:14,00:04:15,"Yeah, yeah."
00:04:15,00:04:16,Good for him.
00:04:16,00:04:19,"Yeah, he, uh, he won the Gershwin prize at the White House where they do it."
00:04:19,00:04:23,And he gave a speech and he said he was an interesting fact about Paul and then told that.
00:04:23,00:04:24,"Well, I see."
00:04:24,00:04:25,Do you think that was original research from?
00:04:25,00:04:26,From.
00:04:26,00:04:27,It's all own research.
00:04:27,00:04:32,"Um, I had a thing about Lassen, which I wanted to tell you because I really, really like"
00:04:32,00:04:33,it.
00:04:33,00:04:38,"Um, when Pope Benedict, the 16th resigned, one of the journalists who broke up with"
00:04:38,00:04:45,"the story, only got it because she could understand the Latin in which he made the announcement."
00:04:45,00:04:46,Right.
00:04:46,00:04:48,"And as a result, she got the scoop before anybody else."
00:04:48,00:04:49,Her name was Giovanna Cheery.
00:04:49,00:04:52,"Oh, she must have been very cheery about that."
00:04:52,00:04:53,Yeah.
00:04:53,00:04:54,"It was a weird one, wasn't it?"
00:04:54,00:04:58,Because he was just doing a general talk to about six or seven journalists and they were
00:04:58,00:05:00,just talking about basic stuff.
00:05:00,00:05:02,They all understood what he was saying was being translated.
00:05:02,00:05:05,"And then he spoke that bit in Latin, that particular bit."
00:05:05,00:05:06,Right.
00:05:06,00:05:07,She was the only one who got it.
00:05:07,00:05:10,And she kind of pre-announced it without confirmation.
00:05:10,00:05:11,She was lucky.
00:05:11,00:05:12,She was right.
00:05:12,00:05:13,Yeah.
00:05:13,00:05:14,"She was a bit like, I'm not sure if he did."
00:05:14,00:05:15,I'm pretty sure he did just say that.
00:05:15,00:05:17,Did that word mean resign or olive?
00:05:17,00:05:18,Yeah.
00:05:18,00:05:19,Ah.
00:05:19,00:05:20,Ah.
00:05:20,00:05:22,"I just wanted an olive, guys."
00:05:22,00:05:26,"But it's an interesting thing, they, um, because Latin in the Vatican, obviously, is still"
00:05:26,00:05:27,a big thing.
00:05:27,00:05:30,They're constantly updating because of all the new words that we have.
00:05:30,00:05:31,Yeah.
00:05:31,00:05:32,That's so good.
00:05:32,00:05:33,Have we spoken about that particular thing?
00:05:33,00:05:36,Like words like dishwasher are now in the new Latin dictionary.
00:05:36,00:05:41,"And so are, um, what web there is web, web, web, and they're quite behind if they've only"
00:05:41,00:05:42,just updated it with digital.
00:05:42,00:05:43,"I mean, yeah."
00:05:43,00:05:48,"About my phone and rush hour, which I don't know when that movie made it to the Vatican."
00:05:48,00:05:52,I've only just got it and this one that's been released.
00:05:52,00:05:56,"Um, speaking of Pope Benedict, have we spoken about the fact that he released, uh, top,"
00:05:56,00:05:58,"he released a Christmas album, didn't he?"
00:05:58,00:05:59,A Christmas music album.
00:05:59,00:06:00,No.
00:06:00,00:06:03,"And so in 2009, before he resigned, he released a Christmas music album, uh, it was prayers"
00:06:03,00:06:05,set to classical music.
00:06:05,00:06:07,And it was with Snoop Dogg's record label.
00:06:07,00:06:08,Wow.
00:06:08,00:06:09,Yeah.
00:06:09,00:06:10,Geffen Records.
00:06:10,00:06:13,Snoop Dogg collaborates with a lot of people like that.
00:06:13,00:06:15,"He didn't, he did a song with Buzz Aldrin."
00:06:15,00:06:17,A lot of people like the mother.
00:06:17,00:06:18,Yeah.
00:06:18,00:06:19,So the Dalai Lada.
00:06:19,00:06:24,"No, um, Buzz Aldrin, just like people who are not in music is what I meant."
00:06:24,00:06:25,Yeah.
00:06:25,00:06:26,"Old people who, yeah."
00:06:26,00:06:28,"He went to Beyond Coronation Street, didn't he?"
00:06:28,00:06:29,The Pope.
00:06:29,00:06:30,I'll snoop.
00:06:30,00:06:31,"Yeah, does he?"
00:06:31,00:06:34,"No, it's not the news a while ago though, he was going to be on Coronation Street, but"
00:06:34,00:06:35,I don't think he ever did.
00:06:35,00:06:36,I think we would have heard.
00:06:36,00:06:37,Yeah.
00:06:37,00:06:38,Yeah.
00:06:38,00:06:44,"Um, I was reading that J.K. Rowling's, um, obviously the Philosopher's Stone has released"
00:06:44,00:06:45,in Latin.
00:06:45,00:06:46,"Oh, yeah."
00:06:46,00:06:47,Yeah.
00:06:47,00:06:51,"And it, so it's Harry Espotto, uh, is what the book was called, and it was the Philosopher's"
00:06:51,00:06:52,Stone one.
00:06:52,00:06:55,"Um, they also translated it into ancient Greek."
00:06:55,00:07:00,And apparently it's the longest ancient Greek text to have been produced since 3AD.
00:07:00,00:07:01,Wow.
00:07:01,00:07:02,"Oh, yeah."
00:07:02,00:07:03,That's amazing.
00:07:03,00:07:08,"And also, um, this is interesting."
00:07:08,00:07:11,"The book, the Order of the Phoenix, when that came out."
00:07:11,00:07:16,"So just going from the idea that we had three Latin songs in a British chart in France, when"
00:07:16,00:07:19,"the book came out, they did this thing where they didn't pre-give the book to different"
00:07:19,00:07:20,countries to translate it.
00:07:20,00:07:24,"They basically had to wait for the English book to be released, and then they started translating"
00:07:24,00:07:25,the Harry Potter book.
00:07:25,00:07:28,So it was a big rush to sort of which country could get them quicker for the demand.
00:07:28,00:07:29,Yeah.
00:07:29,00:07:32,"In France, they couldn't wait for the book to be translated."
00:07:32,00:07:37,"So Order of the Phoenix is the only non, sorry, non-French book to hit number one in the"
00:07:37,00:07:41,French bestseller's list in France as a book.
00:07:41,00:07:42,That's great.
00:07:42,00:07:45,"Just on the Order of the Phoenix one as well, there was this thing in Venezuela where they"
00:07:45,00:07:49,knew the release date was going to be about six months after or five months after the release
00:07:49,00:07:50,of Order of the Phoenix.
00:07:50,00:07:51,They couldn't be bothered waiting.
00:07:51,00:07:56,And some guy just translated it on his own and released it and people bought it.
00:07:56,00:08:00,"But it, by all accounts, was the worst translation because it's packed with sentences."
00:08:00,00:08:03,This is a genuine sentence from it.
00:08:03,00:08:07,Here comes something that I am unable to translate.
00:08:07,00:08:08,Sorry.
00:08:08,00:08:14,"And then later on after another sentence, there's a bracket that said, I'm sorry, I don't understand"
00:08:14,00:08:15,what that means.
00:08:15,00:08:18,So it's just totally littered with the translator.
00:08:18,00:08:21,It makes us actually a bit more terrifying.
00:08:21,00:08:25,"If you're describing something, it's like this thing is so awesome, I can't even put it"
00:08:25,00:08:26,into words.
00:08:26,00:08:27,Yeah.
00:08:27,00:08:28,It's like another version of Voldemort.
00:08:28,00:08:33,"Yeah, I'll be named the literally I can't name it."
00:08:33,00:08:34,Sorry guys.
00:08:34,00:08:39,"Do you guys know the only New York Times bestseller to be written in Latin, bestselling book to be"
00:08:39,00:08:40,written in Latin?
00:08:40,00:08:41,"Oh, no."
00:08:41,00:08:42,Can you give us a clue?
00:08:42,00:08:43,Is it Winnie the Pooh?
00:08:43,00:08:44,"Yes, it is."
00:08:44,00:08:45,"Because there was a version of Winnie the Pooh in Latin, wasn't there?"
00:08:45,00:08:46,It's Winnie Ile Pooh.
00:08:46,00:08:47,Yeah.
00:08:47,00:08:48,Winnie Ile Pooh.
00:08:48,00:08:51,It was on the bestseller list for 20 weeks.
00:08:51,00:08:52,That's pretty good.
00:08:52,00:08:53,Yeah.
00:08:53,00:08:55,"It's very, I imagine there's not much vocabulary in it."
00:08:55,00:08:57,So it's probably quite good for teaching children who are learning Latin.
00:08:57,00:08:58,Yeah.
00:08:58,00:08:59,It's a Grinch.
00:08:59,00:09:03,"So the Doctor's Use, three Doctor's Use books have also been translated into Latin, which"
00:09:03,00:09:04,I would have thought would be...
00:09:04,00:09:05,"Wait, Doctor's Use or Doctor's Use?"
00:09:05,00:09:06,Doctor's Use.
00:09:06,00:09:09,Because that would be for Greek if anything.
00:09:09,00:09:10,I don't think...
00:09:10,00:09:12,I don't think this use was a Doctor.
00:09:12,00:09:14,I think he had bigger vision of fry.
00:09:14,00:09:17,Maybe he's medical science as well.
00:09:17,00:09:18,Doctor's Choice.
00:09:18,00:09:19,Doctor's Choice.
00:09:19,00:09:21,"But if I said Doctor's Choice, people would call me a dickhead."
00:09:21,00:09:22,Yeah.
00:09:22,00:09:23,"So I say Doctor's Seuce, then."
00:09:23,00:09:24,Doctor's Seuce.
00:09:24,00:09:25,I always say.
00:09:25,00:09:26,I always say Doctor's Seuce.
00:09:26,00:09:27,Yeah.
00:09:27,00:09:28,Yeah.
00:09:28,00:09:30,So Christmas and two others have been...
00:09:30,00:09:33,"In fact, okay, I'll tell you the two others and see if you know what they are."
00:09:33,00:09:35,I see some of you will.
00:09:35,00:09:37,"Cat us, pet us, at us."
00:09:37,00:09:38,The cat in the hat.
00:09:38,00:09:39,Correct.
00:09:39,00:09:42,"And we're at Oua, exclamation mark."
00:09:42,00:09:44,"We're at Perna, two exclamation marks."
00:09:44,00:09:45,"Green eggs, green herm."
00:09:45,00:09:46,"Oh, green eggs in herm."
00:09:46,00:09:47,Green eggs in herm.
00:09:47,00:09:48,Green eggs in herm.
00:09:48,00:09:49,Yeah.
00:09:49,00:09:50,Very good.
00:09:50,00:09:51,Study it till the age of 18.
00:09:51,00:09:53,Still didn't get the cat in the hat one.
00:09:53,00:09:55,Cat us is a tough one.
00:09:55,00:09:56,Yeah.
00:09:56,00:10:01,That's what I'm really talking about.
00:10:01,00:10:06,"The Latin Wikipedia has 94,000 articles, which is amazing when you think about it."
00:10:06,00:10:07,Yeah.
00:10:07,00:10:08,"I mean, that's much more than many other languages."
00:10:08,00:10:09,Yeah.
00:10:09,00:10:11,"In fact, I wonder where that features in Wikipedia language are."
00:10:11,00:10:12,Yeah.
00:10:12,00:10:14,And you can get Facebook in Latin as well.
00:10:14,00:10:16,"Instead of the like button, there's a mihi-plaket button."
00:10:16,00:10:18,It is pleasing to me.
00:10:18,00:10:19,It is pleasing to me.
00:10:19,00:10:20,Yeah.
00:10:20,00:10:29,"The other languages that Latin almost, you know, was the Latin tribe was vying with before"
00:10:29,00:10:30,they became the Romans.
00:10:30,00:10:35,"You know, when they were just a tiny tribe in southern Italy, there were really cool names"
00:10:35,00:10:40,"that Wolfskian, Oskan and Falleskin, these were just other languages doing the rounds in"
00:10:40,00:10:41,the area.
00:10:41,00:10:44,"Falleskin sounds like it comes from Falles, doesn't it?"
00:10:44,00:10:45,"Yeah, it does."
00:10:45,00:10:46,It does.
00:10:46,00:10:47,It does.
00:10:47,00:10:48,Penis language.
00:10:48,00:10:49,I'm sure they get a lot of that at school.
00:10:49,00:10:53,"Like any more of it for you guys, especially if they lost to the Romans, embarrassing."
00:10:53,00:10:59,"Anyway, Germany, I think, is the only country to have had a number one song in Elvish."
00:10:59,00:11:00,Because--
00:11:00,00:11:01,Wow.
00:11:01,00:11:02,A lot of the rings.
00:11:02,00:11:03,Yeah.
00:11:03,00:11:04,It was the Anya track.
00:11:04,00:11:05,"Director, producer, promoter, whatever."
00:11:05,00:11:06,This is called in the business.
00:11:06,00:11:11,Decided that her musical ideas were too complex and interesting to get across in any language
00:11:11,00:11:12,that existed.
00:11:12,00:11:17,"So they wrote a new language for her, in which some of her other songs are sung, which"
00:11:17,00:11:21,"is called Amaranthine, that's Anya's language, got her own language."
00:11:21,00:11:23,"Hey, now we were talking about dishwasher's earlier."
00:11:23,00:11:24,Yeah.
00:11:24,00:11:29,"The Latin for dishwasher, and obviously we all know in terrible words, but it's something"
00:11:29,00:11:35,"like Escaraeorium as the first word, something like that, that's not correct, lavatory."
00:11:35,00:11:36,"Oh, yeah."
00:11:36,00:11:37,"Oh, yeah."
00:11:37,00:11:38,Lavatory's a lavatory.
00:11:38,00:11:39,That's a lavatory.
00:11:39,00:11:40,Lavoy is to wash.
00:11:40,00:11:41,"To wash, yeah."
00:11:41,00:11:42,Yeah.
00:11:42,00:11:47,"Lavatory was, I think, an ecclesiastical room for washing in a church or in a monastery or"
00:11:47,00:11:48,that kind of thing.
00:11:48,00:11:50,Lavatory was the room where you go and have a wash.
00:11:50,00:11:55,Who do you think was the first person who took a poo in there and transformed it?
00:11:55,00:11:56,I was wrong.
00:11:56,00:11:57,Oh.
00:11:57,00:11:58,Father Dave.
00:11:58,00:11:59,What have you done?
00:11:59,00:12:04,It was time the room branched out.
00:12:04,00:12:07,Do you know if that's what happened with all the words?
00:12:07,00:12:08,Yes.
00:12:08,00:12:12,"Someone just, like, Dave, father Dave, this used to be a place where we just had a"
00:12:12,00:12:13,bath.
00:12:13,00:12:17,Now the Deficatorium's completely ruined holiday.
00:12:17,00:12:23,"Okay, it's time for back number two and that is Chazinski."
00:12:23,00:12:28,"My fact is that the way to recognize the Buddha is to look out for his webbed feet, a tongue"
00:12:28,00:12:32,that can reach his ears and withdrawn genitalia.
00:12:32,00:12:34,That's a good excuse on a date.
00:12:34,00:12:35,"No, no."
00:12:35,00:12:36,It's not small.
00:12:36,00:12:37,I'm the Buddha.
00:12:37,00:12:38,I'm the reincarnated Buddha.
00:12:38,00:12:39,"Oh, yeah."
00:12:39,00:12:42,"Then show me your tongue, because I can get on board with it."
00:12:42,00:12:57,"So, yeah, these are some of the 32, these are three of the 32 lakh sharnas or special bodily"
00:12:57,00:13:02,features of the Buddha and they're what proper representation of the Buddha must have that
00:13:02,00:13:04,make him the perfect being.
00:13:04,00:13:08,So the perfect being has these features as well as various other things like 40 teeth rather
00:13:08,00:13:15,than 32 and ankle bones that are hardly noticeable and an excellent sense of taste.
00:13:15,00:13:20,"It is an amazing list of characteristics that the Buddha had, I mean, this is Buddha original"
00:13:20,00:13:27,"as well, Buddha classic, if you will, had thighs like a royal stag, a ten foot aura and"
00:13:27,00:13:36,"the area below armpits well filled with hair or yeah, so wait, are there 32 of these?"
00:13:36,00:13:39,"I don't know what they'll fill with, I think both with flesh maybe."
00:13:39,00:13:43,There's an additional 80 extra little tiny things if you want to look at and what's really
00:13:43,00:13:47,"weird is they point out that the extra 80 things are just like, you know, you've confirmed"
00:13:47,00:13:52,"its Buddha, you know, his tongue can wrap around his ears, he's got these web feet, it's"
00:13:52,00:13:54,definitely Buddha.
00:13:54,00:13:57,"But if you just want to make doubly sure that it's him, there's these 80 extra things and"
00:13:57,00:14:04,"I read through the 80 and they are quite simple, but then one is he can fly."
00:14:04,00:14:07,"That feels like it should be the first one, I'd be the first thing I'd ask him, yeah."
00:14:07,00:14:12,"And they're so mixed as well, like one of them is he has a protruding nose, number 28 of"
00:14:12,00:14:16,"the extra 80 and the one before it is, he has the strength of a thousand elephants."
00:14:16,00:14:18,"No, no, he doesn't."
00:14:18,00:14:24,He has a strength of a thousand crore elephants and the crore is 10 million and so he has
00:14:24,00:14:26,a strength of 10 billion elephants.
00:14:26,00:14:27,"Sorry, that was my mistake."
00:14:27,00:14:31,"But I mean, that the Buddha, 10 billion elephants, that's the kind of strength that he's"
00:14:31,00:14:32,put out.
00:14:32,00:14:36,"To be fair, once you're strong enough that you can pull 10 elephants, the extra just feels"
00:14:36,00:14:37,like showing off.
00:14:37,00:14:38,"Yeah, you're right."
00:14:38,00:14:40,Number 75 in this list of 80.
00:14:40,00:14:47,So he is either completely bald or has a full crop of hair.
00:14:47,00:14:50,"No, it's between those."
00:14:50,00:14:54,"No, yeah."
00:14:54,00:14:58,"So what I like about this list is that it's not only just what he was, but if you were"
00:14:58,00:15:04,"looking out for Buddha as a reincarnation, these are all the things that he would have still."
00:15:04,00:15:08,And I was looking into reincarnation just generally because we haven't had a reincarnation
00:15:08,00:15:10,"of the Buddha, but we obviously have the Dalai Lama."
00:15:10,00:15:13,"He's a reincarnation of, so he's the 14th, I believe."
00:15:13,00:15:17,"He's threatening, and I don't know what the latest update on this is, but he's saying"
00:15:17,00:15:21,he might not reincarnate anymore just to stick it to the Chinese.
00:15:21,00:15:22,"Yeah, he's going to put it up."
00:15:22,00:15:23,He's going to put it up as a vote.
00:15:23,00:15:24,That is petty.
00:15:24,00:15:26,He's going to take a vote on it.
00:15:26,00:15:30,"But yeah, this is the last, you know, that he may have changed and, you know, how he was speaking"
00:15:30,00:15:31,about it in September last year.
00:15:31,00:15:32,"Yeah, it's very recent."
00:15:32,00:15:33,"Yeah, yeah."
00:15:33,00:15:34,He might not do it.
00:15:34,00:15:38,"But it's so interesting, the way that they do find the reincarnations."
00:15:38,00:15:44,Did I not like give a child some of the old Dalai Lama's possessions and see if he
00:15:44,00:15:45,likes them?
00:15:45,00:15:49,"Yes, so there were a bunch of possessions that were given to him, and he was picking them"
00:15:49,00:15:51,"up saying, oh, this is mine, this is mine."
00:15:51,00:15:52,It tends to be...
00:15:52,00:15:56,"But that's if you give children anything, they say, this is mine, this is mine."
00:15:56,00:16:00,But there was a bunch of things on the ground.
00:16:00,00:16:07,"There was a kid who was told that he was a reincarnation of Lama, and it was down to a few things"
00:16:07,00:16:16,"like he was able to identify the color of the previous Lama's car, and the mileage."
00:16:16,00:16:17,Yeah.
00:16:17,00:16:19,What's in the glove box then?
00:16:19,00:16:22,Some tic-tacks and my gun.
00:16:22,00:16:25,"The guy who stole my car, we did a deal."
00:16:25,00:16:29,"Can I just ask a question about this, right?"
00:16:29,00:16:34,So this guy is supposed to be the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama.
00:16:34,00:16:35,"No, no, sorry."
00:16:35,00:16:36,Of another...
00:16:36,00:16:37,There are lots of Lama's that you can be.
00:16:37,00:16:39,Like a punch in Lama or something.
00:16:39,00:16:40,"Yeah, yeah."
00:16:40,00:16:47,"So, like, for example, it's been confirmed that Steven Segal is the reincarnation of a 17th"
00:16:47,00:16:50,century Buddhist spirit called Chongdrige Dorje.
00:16:50,00:16:55,When you say it is being confirmed by the community of like the Dalai Lama people.
00:16:55,00:16:56,"By evidence, Andy."
00:16:56,00:16:57,By evidence.
00:16:57,00:16:58,Sorry.
00:16:58,00:16:59,Right.
00:16:59,00:17:02,"Yeah, so he's not obviously the Dalai Lama, but he is a..."
00:17:02,00:17:06,"The China tried to make their own Lama, didn't they?"
00:17:06,00:17:09,I thought it was their own Dalai Lama.
00:17:09,00:17:12,"They said, right, okay, the guy that you guys have chosen in Tibet isn't the real one."
00:17:12,00:17:14,"We're going to have a lottery to choose, which is the real one."
00:17:14,00:17:15,"Oh, really?"
00:17:15,00:17:16,And they've had a lottery.
00:17:16,00:17:20,"Like, they put a load of names in an urn and pulled one out, and it was a child."
00:17:20,00:17:21,How did that go for them?
00:17:21,00:17:22,Is he being raised now?
00:17:22,00:17:23,"I think he is, isn't he?"
00:17:23,00:17:24,I think he is.
00:17:24,00:17:25,"I think he is, isn't he?"
00:17:25,00:17:28,"Could I just mention yogic flying, because I like it."
00:17:28,00:17:29,Yeah.
00:17:29,00:17:32,"So, you know, there was this big 1950s movement, the Transcendental Meditation movement,"
00:17:32,00:17:37,"and it was a group of people who took on the idea of the power of the frog, I think it's"
00:17:37,00:17:40,"called in Hindu and Buddhist philosophy, and it's the idea that you could reach a state"
00:17:40,00:17:42,of meditation where you can fly.
00:17:42,00:17:46,"And the famously, there was the natural law party in the 80s, where they tried to get"
00:17:46,00:17:50,"into politics, and they would do this for the flying thing."
00:17:50,00:17:51,Yeah.
00:17:51,00:17:54,"So, it's quite funny, when I think there's video footage of the groups that tried to do it."
00:17:54,00:17:59,"The Beatles were quite interested in it, and yogic flying has three stages, and stage"
00:17:59,00:18:03,"one is hopping, and stage two is floating, and stage three is flying."
00:18:03,00:18:05,"Oh, I can use one of those."
00:18:05,00:18:06,It's very much...
00:18:06,00:18:09,"The key breach point is between one and two, though, isn't it?"
00:18:09,00:18:10,Right.
00:18:10,00:18:11,"So, you've got two."
00:18:11,00:18:12,Your three is probably going to be fine.
00:18:12,00:18:17,"So, the Transcendental Movement itself admits that no one in the modern era has yet"
00:18:17,00:18:22,got beyond stage one.
00:18:22,00:18:24,"He's had it, guys."
00:18:24,00:18:27,"Do you guys know, have you guys heard of Druc Parkunli?"
00:18:27,00:18:28,No.
00:18:28,00:18:30,He was a Buddhist master in the 15th century.
00:18:30,00:18:36,"He was the guy who brought Buddhism to Bhutan, and he had pretty wacky methods of enlightening"
00:18:36,00:18:39,people and pretty wacky Buddhist practices.
00:18:39,00:18:44,"He mainly tried his methods on women, and so he had the title, ""The Saint of the 5,000"
00:18:44,00:18:45,"Women."""
00:18:45,00:18:49,"So, the other things women would seek is blessing in the form of sex."
00:18:49,00:18:51,"He's called the Divine Madman, is that the guy?"
00:18:51,00:18:52,He's still called the Divine Madman.
00:18:52,00:18:56,"His penis is called the Thunderbolt of Flaming Wisdom, because..."
00:18:56,00:18:57,"Yeah, I've been invited by it."
00:18:57,00:18:58,"Oh, you have, haven't you?"
00:18:58,00:18:59,Yeah.
00:18:59,00:19:00,What do you mean?
00:19:00,00:19:01,What?
00:19:01,00:19:08,"When I've been to a, what do you call these, like a temple of his, and as you go in there's"
00:19:08,00:19:12,"a priest with a large wooden phallus, and he sort of puts it on your shoulder, like"
00:19:12,00:19:16,"writing it like the Queen would, well..."
00:19:16,00:19:20,"The Queen would, exactly, but then it's supposed to be like a fertility thing."
00:19:20,00:19:21,"God, Boltons changed."
00:19:21,00:19:22,It's always last there.
00:19:22,00:19:23,Where is it?
00:19:23,00:19:24,Where is it in the Bhutan?
00:19:24,00:19:25,"Okay, cool."
00:19:25,00:19:26,That's an apunachra thing.
00:19:26,00:19:27,That's amazing.
00:19:27,00:19:28,That's what he does.
00:19:28,00:19:31,"He's been anointed by the phallus of, what is it called, the Thunderbolt of..."
00:19:31,00:19:33,It's the Thunderbolt of Flaming Wisdom.
00:19:33,00:19:37,"It had the power to turn a woman into deities, but I guess that was the real thing."
00:19:37,00:19:38,I don't think James is a god.
00:19:38,00:19:43,But what happens is you walk into this temple and the priest approaches you with a giant
00:19:43,00:19:44,phallus.
00:19:44,00:19:48,"I imagine the first time that happened, it was probably Brother David."
00:19:48,00:19:49,Exactly.
00:19:49,00:19:54,"Well, the houses around here, they paint phalluses on their walls as well."
00:19:54,00:19:55,Around there.
00:19:55,00:19:56,Around this area.
00:19:56,00:19:57,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:19:57,00:20:03,"And this, yeah, if you go around there, there's like shops like that sell like local produce"
00:20:03,00:20:05,and they all have big pictures of penises on the walls.
00:20:05,00:20:08,"You would draw those on walls around near where I live as well, actually, yeah."
00:20:08,00:20:09,I don't know.
00:20:09,00:20:10,So you guys were religious comedians?
00:20:10,00:20:11,You were religious comedians.
00:20:11,00:20:12,"Yeah, apparently."
00:20:12,00:20:13,On your front door.
00:20:13,00:20:14,Yeah.
00:20:14,00:20:15,What a devout place.
00:20:15,00:20:16,We are.
00:20:16,00:20:23,"Maybe that's what the Buddha meant when he says withdrawn genitalia, withdrawn genitalia."
00:20:23,00:20:24,Oh my goodness.
00:20:24,00:20:27,Oh my goodness.
00:20:27,00:20:31,See the podcast.
00:20:31,00:20:32,Stop the podcast.
00:20:32,00:20:33,"Hi, everybody."
00:20:33,00:20:34,It's Andy here.
00:20:34,00:20:37,Sorry to cut into the fact a get in that's happening.

00:20:50,00:20:52,They offer a lot of support and things like that.
00:20:52,00:20:56,"And also if you go to their website and type in the code fish, they'll give you 10% off"
00:20:56,00:20:57,your website.
00:20:57,00:20:58,All right.
00:20:58,00:21:01,Carry on with the podcast.
00:21:01,00:21:04,"Okay, time for fact number three."
00:21:04,00:21:05,And that's my fact.
00:21:05,00:21:10,And my fact this week is that the whoopie cushion was invented by Roman Emperor called
00:21:10,00:21:11,Basie Anus.
00:21:11,00:21:15,Now that is just I've never heard of this emperor.
00:21:15,00:21:21,"So the Roman Emperor Ella Gabelus, he is, he's the famous, that's his name, his birth"
00:21:21,00:21:23,name was Basie Anus.
00:21:23,00:21:27,"Now I'm sure it might be pronounced Cassianus, sorry like that, but when you read it and you"
00:21:27,00:21:31,"find out he invented the whoopie cushion, I just don't know how."
00:21:31,00:21:32,You can't let that go.
00:21:32,00:21:33,Yeah.
00:21:33,00:21:34,Basie Anus.
00:21:34,00:21:36,"Well, describe the whoopie cushion."
00:21:36,00:21:41,"Well, it was obviously a prototype to what we have now."
00:21:41,00:21:45,He was in development of health in nearly 2000 years.
00:21:45,00:21:46,prototype.
00:21:46,00:21:52,He just used to bring a cushion that had air in it and he would bring it to his dinner parties.
00:21:52,00:21:56,"And he was only 14 or so at the time, he was a very young emperor."
00:21:56,00:22:02,"And it just used to be his little party trick, his little, let out air while he was there."
00:22:02,00:22:03,"That's all we know about it, really, isn't it?"
00:22:03,00:22:08,"Yeah, it couldn't be rather, it could be rather that they were at a normal height and then"
00:22:08,00:22:10,just got lower and lower and lower as it went on.
00:22:10,00:22:13,"I don't know if it made a farting noise, it might have done."
00:22:13,00:22:18,"Yeah, I think it's, I mean, any, you know, anything full of air where you've got something"
00:22:18,00:22:21,coming out of a sphincter that it's going to make a noise.
00:22:21,00:22:23,"Yeah, especially because they had to come out slowly, I guess, because they had to sink"
00:22:23,00:22:24,gradually.
00:22:24,00:22:26,And they would be one of the squeaky farts.
00:22:26,00:22:27,Yeah.
00:22:27,00:22:28,But went on forever.
00:22:28,00:22:29,"Yeah, yeah."
00:22:29,00:22:30,All dinner.
00:22:30,00:22:33,"Oh, this is still embarrassing."
00:22:33,00:22:39,"Another thing Ella Gabelus did to dinner guests, apparently, is suffocated a bunch of dinner"
00:22:39,00:22:42,guests under loads of rose petals.
00:22:42,00:22:43,Really?
00:22:43,00:22:44,He was been rebastered.
00:22:44,00:22:47,"But yeah, I think that was quite an imaginative way to go about murdering your dinner guests"
00:22:47,00:22:48,if you do want to do that.
00:22:48,00:22:49,That's true.
00:22:49,00:22:50,Did he mean to you?
00:22:50,00:22:52,Or was that actually he actually just wanted them to go home?
00:22:52,00:22:54,It was kind of his way of hinting that it was late.
00:22:54,00:22:55,He was tired.
00:22:55,00:22:56,Yeah.
00:22:56,00:23:02,"He locked them in a room, didn't he, and they had a fake ceiling, and he dropped out all these"
00:23:02,00:23:05,"rose petals, but there were so many of them that they all suffocated."
00:23:05,00:23:06,"But he didn't mean them, too."
00:23:06,00:23:07,I thought he was trying to kill them.
00:23:07,00:23:09,"Oh, I don't know."
00:23:09,00:23:10,"He was a total dick, though, wasn't he?"
00:23:10,00:23:11,Yeah.
00:23:11,00:23:14,"Like, I don't know much about him, but from what I've read."
00:23:14,00:23:16,He was a real bassy anor.
00:23:16,00:23:17,Yeah.
00:23:17,00:23:18,He was a nice guy.
00:23:18,00:23:22,"He had all these, I mean, but it's one of those ones where the stories are like half"
00:23:22,00:23:24,"funny, as well as like the bad bits."
00:23:24,00:23:31,"Like he kind of just used to go and prostitute himself in bars and dresses a woman, and he purposefully"
00:23:31,00:23:35,tried to piss off people so that they would beat him up because he had a bit of a fetish
00:23:35,00:23:38,"about being beat up, and he's a very odd character."
00:23:38,00:23:43,"The weirdest thing I read is that he wanted to have his dick chopped off, right?"
00:23:43,00:23:46,"And so he went to a doctor, and the doctor said, I don't want to do that."
00:23:46,00:23:48,"And he said, no, do it."
00:23:48,00:23:51,And they apparently they really like thrashed out the conversation.
00:23:51,00:23:55,"And the compromise, and this from what I read, they said they compromised on."
00:23:55,00:23:56,He was circumcised.
00:23:56,00:23:58,And that's a hell of a compromise.
00:23:58,00:23:59,That's a huge compromise.
00:23:59,00:24:00,Yeah.
00:24:00,00:24:01,That is kind of level one.
00:24:01,00:24:02,That is kind of level one.
00:24:02,00:24:05,"And the few hours of shopping at penis, I'll just take."
00:24:05,00:24:06,Wait.
00:24:06,00:24:08,What's the third one?
00:24:08,00:24:11,I think the third one is the full shopping.
00:24:11,00:24:12,Absolutely.
00:24:12,00:24:13,His total lob off.
00:24:13,00:24:14,"Well, the second one."
00:24:14,00:24:15,I don't want to know.
00:24:15,00:24:16,I don't want to know.
00:24:16,00:24:17,I don't want to know.
00:24:17,00:24:18,Right.
00:24:18,00:24:19,Yeah.
00:24:19,00:24:21,So interesting character.
00:24:21,00:24:22,Yeah.
00:24:22,00:24:25,"And again, it's another thing where just even if it, like for me, the enjoyable thing of the"
00:24:25,00:24:30,"fact is that he was called Bayceanus, but actually the initial thing of the whoopie cushion"
00:24:30,00:24:35,being invented as far back as then is like on a previous podcast when I found out that
00:24:35,00:24:38,yo-yos were being used from that period as well.
00:24:38,00:24:43,It's so out of place to me to think that a whoopie cushion was that far back in time
00:24:43,00:24:44,as a practical joke as well.
00:24:44,00:24:45,Yeah.
00:24:45,00:24:49,"You know, the whoopie cushion when it had its first 20th century origin wasn't actually"
00:24:49,00:24:50,called a whoopie cushion.
00:24:50,00:24:54,It was called a musical seat in 1926.
00:24:54,00:24:56,And it didn't really make a fart noise either.
00:24:56,00:24:57,So it wasn't very good.
00:24:57,00:24:58,But it didn't make music.
00:24:58,00:25:01,"Well, in the catalog it says, sounds like you sat on a cat."
00:25:01,00:25:03,It made this weird little scream.
00:25:03,00:25:09,"It was quite upsetting to hear, apparently, like a screeching cat or a crying child."
00:25:09,00:25:16,And then it was invented and then initially it was called the poo-poo cushion or the boop boop-a-dupe.
00:25:16,00:25:17,These are not good names.
00:25:17,00:25:21,"But when they hit on the name whoopie cushion which was only in 1932, that was after the slang"
00:25:21,00:25:25,"term whoopie, making whoopie is a slang term for having sex."
00:25:25,00:25:27,So the whoopie cushion is named after sex.
00:25:27,00:25:28,So it was a sex cushioned.
00:25:28,00:25:30,So who made that connection?
00:25:30,00:25:31,That was useful.
00:25:31,00:25:32,Yeah.
00:25:32,00:25:35,"Well, there was a hit song in 1928 called Making Whoopie."
00:25:35,00:25:36,Yeah.
00:25:36,00:25:37,And I think who's called the whoopie cushion a few years later?
00:25:37,00:25:43,"Well, I think whoopie then became just having fun on that and then became lighter."
00:25:43,00:25:44,That makes more sense.
00:25:44,00:25:51,"So Soren Sorenson Adams, who was a very famous joke developer, the SS Adams code, loads"
00:25:51,00:25:57,of stuff like the insect in an ice cube and the flower that squirts stuff out.
00:25:57,00:26:00,"Yeah, all of these really classic jokes, a lot of them were invented by him."
00:26:00,00:26:01,Wow.
00:26:01,00:26:05,But he turned down the whoopie cushion initially because he thought it was indelicate.
00:26:05,00:26:08,"And then he realized this mistake soon after it was, you know, to become a big success."
00:26:08,00:26:11,"And he made his own one, which was called the raspberry cushioned."
00:26:11,00:26:12,Okay.
00:26:12,00:26:13,Yeah.
00:26:13,00:26:16,"But he also invented the joy buzzer, which is the hand buzzer."
00:26:16,00:26:17,Exactly.
00:26:17,00:26:18,Yeah.
00:26:18,00:26:19,Okay.
00:26:19,00:26:22,"You know, when you shake hands with someone and there's a buzzer and it's a little electric"
00:26:22,00:26:23,shock or something.
00:26:23,00:26:24,"It's actually just a vibration, isn't it?"
00:26:24,00:26:25,That's it.
00:26:25,00:26:26,Yeah.
00:26:26,00:26:27,But I just want to read you this.
00:26:27,00:26:31,"It was modeled after another product, the zapper, which was similar to the joy buzzer,"
00:26:31,00:26:36,did not have a very effective buzz and contained a button that had a blunt point that would hurt
00:26:36,00:26:38,the person whose hand was shaken.
00:26:38,00:26:43,"So just a mini knife, basically."
00:26:43,00:26:45,It's just got you really good with that one.
00:26:45,00:26:46,"Yeah, I'll get the managers, yeah, yeah."
00:26:46,00:26:47,"It was funny, Brian."
00:26:47,00:26:49,I just stabbed you in the chest.
00:26:49,00:26:52,"Now, just stand underneath all these rose petals."
00:26:52,00:26:53,Yeah.
00:26:53,00:26:55,And take a smell of my flower.
00:26:55,00:26:57,It's a gum.
00:26:57,00:27:03,"So Sir Vincent Adams, he started off with itching powder, no sneezing powder, no sneezing"
00:27:03,00:27:04,powder.
00:27:04,00:27:05,"Okay, yeah."
00:27:05,00:27:09,"And he worked for a company that made this, whatever product it was."
00:27:09,00:27:13,And they had this dustless left over from the product and he noticed that people were sneezing
00:27:13,00:27:14,from it.
00:27:14,00:27:18,"And so then he thought, oh, this is a great prank I can make this and sell it."
00:27:18,00:27:23,And he started selling loads and loads of the sneezing powder and became really big.
00:27:23,00:27:24,It was called Kachoo.
00:27:24,00:27:31,"And his first year, he sold $15,000 worth, but 25 years later the FDA banned it as a toxic"
00:27:31,00:27:32,substance.
00:27:32,00:27:35,"So for all that time, he'd be poisoning people as well as making them sneeze."
00:27:35,00:27:36,"Oh, wow."
00:27:36,00:27:37,It was genuinely toxic.
00:27:37,00:27:38,Yeah.
00:27:38,00:27:39,"No, that's quite funny."
00:27:39,00:27:40,That is health and safety gone mad.
00:27:40,00:27:43,"Another thing they used was itching powder, wasn't it, in World War II?"
00:27:43,00:27:44,Okay.
00:27:44,00:27:48,"And it came, there was an idea to plant itching powder on Nazis in various ways."
00:27:48,00:27:51,"And on the, on the like instructions that were given to people who were trying to infiltrate"
00:27:51,00:27:54,"and plant this, it said, the greatest effect is produced by a plant."
00:27:54,00:27:58,"Find the powder to the inside of the underclothing, so I don't know how it was intended."
00:27:58,00:27:59,I'll do it.
00:27:59,00:28:00,Wow.
00:28:00,00:28:01,"Yeah, exactly."
00:28:01,00:28:04,"I think when they were pitching that in the meeting, they said, okay, so let me get this right."
00:28:04,00:28:06,You've made it right up to a Nazi.
00:28:06,00:28:09,You got your gun in here.
00:28:09,00:28:10,Okay.
00:28:10,00:28:15,So now I want you to take out the gun and just use it to apply a bit of the itching powder
00:28:15,00:28:16,to his underclothes.
00:28:16,00:28:18,Be careful.
00:28:18,00:28:22,"In World War I, they had sneezing powder, the Germans, this is."
00:28:22,00:28:24,And it didn't do you that much harm.
00:28:24,00:28:28,"Apart from, it made you sneeze, so it made you take off your gas mask and then they'd be"
00:28:28,00:28:30,able to get you with the other stuff.
00:28:30,00:28:31,Cheeky.
00:28:31,00:28:32,Wow.
00:28:32,00:28:33,Okay.
00:28:33,00:28:35,Why don't you take off your gas mask when he sneezes?
00:28:35,00:28:39,"You don't want to get spit when I think it was like, it would kind of just get in the"
00:28:39,00:28:42,"eyes and in the nose and stuff, they just need a fresher."
00:28:42,00:28:43,Okay.
00:28:43,00:28:44,Okay.
00:28:44,00:28:45,Wow.
00:28:45,00:28:48,"The man who invented the fart machine, much later than the whoopee cushion."
00:28:48,00:28:53,"He tried to record the sounds with his friend, his name was Fred Jarrow and his, he and his friend"
00:28:53,00:28:54,"John Blackman, who was developing it."
00:28:54,00:28:58,They tried to record it by going into a recording studio after having eaten lots of fart-causing
00:28:58,00:29:01,food like cabbage and beans and things and they said it didn't work.
00:29:01,00:29:02,They didn't sound right.
00:29:02,00:29:03,Yeah.
00:29:03,00:29:06,What did the people around them say?
00:29:06,00:29:08,You're never using us recording studio again.
00:29:08,00:29:10,What did they use in the end for the sounds?
00:29:10,00:29:11,Synthesizer.
00:29:11,00:29:12,Oh.
00:29:12,00:29:13,Wow.
00:29:13,00:29:14,Wow.
00:29:14,00:29:15,Okay.
00:29:15,00:29:16,Oh yeah.
00:29:16,00:29:17,"Like, my old Yamaha didn't have a fart button."
00:29:17,00:29:20,"So like, is that, have I just not understanding how synthesizers work?"
00:29:20,00:29:21,I don't know.
00:29:21,00:29:25,"So here's the thing, a synthesizer uses recordings of sounds that it does at least."
00:29:25,00:29:27,So it must have got it from somewhere else originally.
00:29:27,00:29:28,Yeah.
00:29:28,00:29:29,All right.
00:29:29,00:29:30,I don't know the full details on this one.
00:29:30,00:29:31,I'm going to fess up.
00:29:31,00:29:35,"I think they use, I think they used existing sounds and slowed them down and sped them up."
00:29:35,00:29:36,Oh yeah.
00:29:36,00:29:37,Made them.
00:29:37,00:29:38,Okay.
00:29:38,00:29:39,Yeah.
00:29:39,00:29:40,Yeah.
00:29:40,00:29:41,Okay.
00:29:41,00:29:42,That makes sense.
00:29:42,00:29:43,Yeah.
00:29:43,00:29:46,One more prankster was Jim Moran in America who was born in 1970.
00:29:46,00:29:47,He lived until 1999.
00:29:47,00:29:50,He was called America's number one prankster.
00:29:50,00:29:56,"And he did lots of, you know, fun, crazy pranks like he walked a bull through a China shot"
00:29:56,00:29:58,once and he did this kind of thing.
00:29:58,00:30:03,He also looked for a needle in a haystack in 1939 and it took him 82 hours before he found
00:30:03,00:30:04,it.
00:30:04,00:30:05,Yeah.
00:30:05,00:30:06,But who's that a Joe Khan?
00:30:06,00:30:07,"No, yeah."
00:30:07,00:30:08,"Of himself, isn't it?"
00:30:08,00:30:10,It was near the bottom and slightly to the left of center.
00:30:10,00:30:13,"But this, I love so much about it."
00:30:13,00:30:17,Pranks does try to set fire to the haystack five times while he was in it.
00:30:17,00:30:18,Out pranking the prankster.
00:30:18,00:30:20,Judges on him.
00:30:20,00:30:23,- Klinger. - Why do you?
00:30:23,00:30:25,- How do you fail to light?
00:30:25,00:30:27,- It's good for him. - Hey.
00:30:27,00:30:29,"- Well, you know the saying, is it like, what?"
00:30:29,00:30:31,"- It's like, trying to say, fire to a haze there."
00:30:31,00:30:33,- How do you know the needle was in there?
00:30:33,00:30:35,- I think he put it in there. - Was he just like
00:30:35,00:30:37,"fingers crossed? Okay, he definitely,"
00:30:37,00:30:38,so if he put it there.
00:30:38,00:30:40,(laughing)
00:30:40,00:30:41,- That's a very good point.
00:30:41,00:30:43,"- Well, he must have thrown it in and then it must have fallen."
00:30:43,00:30:45,"- No, I think he would've got a friend to put it in there."
00:30:45,00:30:48,"- Yeah, yeah. - I'm amazed he had friends."
00:30:48,00:30:50,(laughing)
00:30:50,00:30:58,"- Okay, time for our final fact of the show."
00:30:58,00:30:59,And that is James.
00:30:59,00:31:03,"- Okay, my fact this week is that"
00:31:03,00:31:08,the oldest known purse is decorated with dog's teeth.
00:31:08,00:31:12,- Okay. - So he's very old bling.
00:31:12,00:31:17,"This is found in a grave dated to 2,500 BC."
00:31:18,00:31:23,And it was a leather pouch decorated with dog's teeth
00:31:23,00:31:24,in a nice little pattern.
00:31:24,00:31:26,"But over the years, the leather has disappeared"
00:31:26,00:31:28,so that all was left was the teeth.
00:31:28,00:31:29,- Cool.
00:31:29,00:31:31,"- But they've kind of worked out that it must have been,"
00:31:31,00:31:32,must have been the purse.
00:31:32,00:31:34,- Rather than a dog.
00:31:34,00:31:35,(laughing)
00:31:35,00:31:38,- He was decorated in the shape of the dog's mouth.
00:31:38,00:31:40,(laughing)
00:31:40,00:31:44,And next to it was like a bum bag with decorated with dogs.
00:31:44,00:31:45,- Skellison.
00:31:45,00:31:48,(laughing)
00:31:48,00:31:49,"- Yeah, that's really interesting."
00:31:49,00:31:51,I guess they use what they could find.
00:31:51,00:31:52,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:31:52,00:31:54,- What were they carrying back then?
00:31:54,00:31:55,"- I don't know, really."
00:31:55,00:31:57,"If you would carry, let's say you'd carry"
00:31:57,00:31:58,- More dogs' teeth.
00:31:58,00:31:59,(laughing)
00:31:59,00:32:00,- They meant the purse.
00:32:00,00:32:01,- Something valuable or some food
00:32:01,00:32:04,"or some, you know, a tool or something."
00:32:04,00:32:05,- Yeah.
00:32:05,00:32:08,"- And so this is according to Harold Stalbel,"
00:32:08,00:32:11,the senior archaeologist at Germany's Saxon State
00:32:11,00:32:13,Archaeology Office.
00:32:13,00:32:15,And he thinks that it was very fashionable at the time
00:32:15,00:32:18,to decorate these handbags with dogs' teeth
00:32:18,00:32:21,'cause he says that not everyone was buried with them.
00:32:21,00:32:22,It was only people of high status.
00:32:22,00:32:23,- Right.
00:32:23,00:32:25,- So it must have been quite good.
00:32:25,00:32:28,- High status people who are catching dogs.
00:32:28,00:32:29,- Yeah.
00:32:29,00:32:30,- Maybe that was a sign of yours.
00:32:30,00:32:32,"I mean, what meant high status 3,000 years ago?"
00:32:32,00:32:34,"- Yeah, we're, what, like, civilization"
00:32:34,00:32:36,are we talking about?
00:32:36,00:32:37,- What's wrong with stone age?
00:32:37,00:32:38,- Bronze age. - Yeah.
00:32:38,00:32:39,- Bronze age.
00:32:39,00:32:41,"- I do like that we've, humans have wanted to"
00:32:41,00:32:44,"adorn ourselves since, as long as we know,"
00:32:44,00:32:46,"they've existed, basically."
00:32:46,00:32:47,"And we've just fine, fine, all the kids."
00:32:47,00:32:49,"- Yeah, and the cells as well, didn't they?"
00:32:49,00:32:51,"They had, like, little trinkets and stuff"
00:32:51,00:32:52,they were buried with.
00:32:52,00:32:53,- Yeah.
00:32:53,00:32:56,"Like, I think that oldest, I think maybe until 2006,"
00:32:56,00:32:59,"the oldest jewelry we had was snail shells, weren't they?"
00:32:59,00:33:03,"From about 75, I wanna say 75,000 years ago."
00:33:03,00:33:07,And we found them in a cave in South Africa.
00:33:07,00:33:09,"And it was just, like, little holes drilled in snail shells,"
00:33:09,00:33:11,"which they think they used to hook them into their,"
00:33:11,00:33:13,some bit of their body.
00:33:13,00:33:15,"- In the Bible, Judas is specifically identified"
00:33:15,00:33:17,as the guy who was carrying the purse.
00:33:17,00:33:18,- See?
00:33:18,00:33:18,- Yeah.
00:33:18,00:33:20,"- Well, he was given money in the purse."
00:33:20,00:33:22,"Wasn't he, he was given 30 pieces of silver"
00:33:22,00:33:23,in that's true purse.
00:33:23,00:33:25,"- I thought that was, what was the name?"
00:33:25,00:33:27,- His name.
00:33:27,00:33:28,"- Sorry, gone."
00:33:28,00:33:31,"- Well, he took, if Jesus was given anything."
00:33:31,00:33:34,"So it says in John's Gospel, Judas had the purse into which"
00:33:34,00:33:36,was put whatsoever was ministered to Christ.
00:33:36,00:33:39,So he was the banker.
00:33:39,00:33:41,"As always, when playing monopoly, as in the Bible,"
00:33:41,00:33:43,don't trust the banker.
00:33:43,00:33:46,(all laughing)
00:33:46,00:33:47,- He's cheated.
00:33:47,00:33:49,- That'd be a good action version of monopoly.
00:33:49,00:33:51,"- Yeah, well, you have to betray one of them,"
00:33:51,00:33:53,one of the other players who's then crucified.
00:33:53,00:33:55,(all laughing)
00:33:55,00:33:58,"- That must be why, so Judas is scarier."
00:33:58,00:34:01,"The name is scarier, it comes from the Latin score tear,"
00:34:01,00:34:03,which is a purse or a bag used to carry money.
00:34:03,00:34:04,- Yeah.
00:34:04,00:34:06,- So maybe that's why the word scrotum comes from.
00:34:06,00:34:07,- I wonder.
00:34:07,00:34:08,- I bet it is.
00:34:08,00:34:10,- So was he Mr. Moneybags?
00:34:10,00:34:11,- I guess he was Mr. Moneybags.
00:34:11,00:34:12,"- Oh, Mr. Scrotum."
00:34:12,00:34:13,(all laughing)
00:34:13,00:34:15,"- No one, he was resentful."
00:34:15,00:34:16,"- Guys, it means moneybags."
00:34:16,00:34:18,(all laughing)
00:34:18,00:34:21,"- You'll see, you'll see, yeah, yeah, Judas."
00:34:21,00:34:23,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, Scrotum."
00:34:23,00:34:26,"- Well, Scrotum's have been used as purses."
00:34:26,00:34:27,- Perfect.
00:34:27,00:34:29,"- Well, they use them, like in Australia,"
00:34:29,00:34:30,you can buy like kangaroo scrotum.
00:34:30,00:34:31,"- Oh, yeah."
00:34:31,00:34:32,"- Oh, that's right, that's really big at the moment."
00:34:32,00:34:34,"- Yeah, it is, yeah."
00:34:34,00:34:38,- Apparently the best one is a W-shaped kangaroo scrotum purse.
00:34:38,00:34:41,"And that is kind of, if you can imagine the two bits"
00:34:41,00:34:44,"of the testicles go, rather than being attached"
00:34:44,00:34:48,"like webtoes might be, they're kind of more like a W-shaped."
00:34:48,00:34:49,- Is that so you can keep different things
00:34:49,00:34:50,in the different--
00:34:50,00:34:51,- I think it's just 'cause they're rare.
00:34:51,00:34:55,"It's like one in 10,000 kangaroo scrotums shaped like this."
00:34:55,00:34:58,"- It's like a lucky folly clover, except for the kangaroo."
00:34:58,00:35:01,(all laughing)
00:35:01,00:35:04,"- Speaking of designer, handbags and stuff like that,"
00:35:05,00:35:10,women's bags are much more expensive than men's bags
00:35:10,00:35:12,no matter what they look like or anything.
00:35:12,00:35:16,"So there was, there's a purse blog run by someone"
00:35:16,00:35:18,"called Amanda Moll, and she looked at all the different things"
00:35:18,00:35:22,"that you could buy, and she found that for two bags,"
00:35:22,00:35:25,"which are virtually identical, one for women and one for men."
00:35:25,00:35:28,"The woman's won cost $2.96 a cubic inch,"
00:35:28,00:35:31,"and the men's won cost $1.54 a cubic inch,"
00:35:31,00:35:34,"and they're pretty much identical, so the idea is basically"
00:35:34,00:35:36,to just charge Mark as it's same little woman.
00:35:36,00:35:40,"- So on designer bags, Louis Vuitton apparently burns"
00:35:40,00:35:43,"all of his bags that he's made that year,"
00:35:43,00:35:45,"not him personally, he gets someone to burn,"
00:35:45,00:35:46,"all the bags he's made that year,"
00:35:46,00:35:48,"so that they don't get sold on the cheap,"
00:35:48,00:35:51,the next year 'cause it devalues the items.
00:35:51,00:35:53,"- Wow, so all the ones that have been sold"
00:35:53,00:35:53,in the shop say--
00:35:53,00:35:56,"- So first of all, they have an in-house private Louis Vuitton"
00:35:56,00:35:57,"sale for Louis Vuitton staff,"
00:35:57,00:35:59,"so people can buy, like, slightly reduced price,"
00:35:59,00:36:02,"and then, but they keep tabs on who's bought them,"
00:36:02,00:36:03,so they can track them.
00:36:03,00:36:04,"So if one of them appears on eBay,"
00:36:04,00:36:06,"Louis's gonna be like, ""You put this on eBay,"
00:36:06,00:36:07,"that's not cool."""
00:36:07,00:36:09,"So you can give one as a gift, I think,"
00:36:09,00:36:10,and then he burns all the rest.
00:36:10,00:36:11,Make sure it doesn't devalue the brand.
00:36:11,00:36:13,- That is insane.
00:36:13,00:36:13,- He's pretty mental.
00:36:13,00:36:14,"- Yeah, that would have been awesome."
00:36:14,00:36:16,- That's why he's never made anything of himself.
00:36:16,00:36:18,(laughing)
00:36:18,00:36:20,- Are there any other careers in which he would just
00:36:20,00:36:22,set fire to all your stuff at the end of the--
00:36:22,00:36:23,"- Well, it kind of reminds me a bit,"
00:36:23,00:36:26,"not setting fire to it, but a bit like what DeBears did"
00:36:26,00:36:28,with diamonds in that they deliberately don't sell them
00:36:28,00:36:29,to keep the prices high.
00:36:29,00:36:30,- Yeah.
00:36:30,00:36:33,"- And grain, I mean, it's the same thing with grain, isn't it?"
00:36:33,00:36:35,Just stop grain prices from going nuts.
00:36:35,00:36:36,I'm not very good at understanding this.
00:36:36,00:36:37,Don't we have huge stocks of grain
00:36:37,00:36:38,that go across and every year?
00:36:38,00:36:42,- I like bottom mountains and all that kind of thing.
00:36:42,00:36:43,- There is a new year's ritual somewhere
00:36:43,00:36:47,where you write down that you make little pieces
00:36:47,00:36:49,"of paper sculpture, basically,"
00:36:49,00:36:51,on which you have already written things
00:36:51,00:36:52,"that you didn't really enjoy about last year,"
00:36:52,00:36:54,and then you set fire to them on midnight.
00:36:54,00:36:54,It's quite fun.
00:36:54,00:36:55,"I've tried that one, yeah."
00:36:55,00:36:56,- Did you?
00:36:56,00:36:58,"- Yeah, set fire to the house."
00:36:58,00:36:59,It was so much that you were unhappy with.
00:36:59,00:37:00,- Yeah.
00:37:00,00:37:03,So the year always begins with a big insurance claim.
00:37:03,00:37:04,(laughing)
00:37:04,00:37:08,"- Emma, that's the first item in the next year's list."
00:37:08,00:37:09,"- That's a thing in China as well,"
00:37:09,00:37:11,"that you write down a confession,"
00:37:11,00:37:13,"and you do on three separate bits of paper,"
00:37:13,00:37:14,"and then you like the confession up,"
00:37:14,00:37:18,and it's a way of almost a priest saying that you can do it.
00:37:18,00:37:20,- That must be bad if your lighter runs out
00:37:20,00:37:22,and you've written something really darkly on the piece
00:37:22,00:37:26,"of paper like, ""Oh my god, oh god, oh god."""
00:37:26,00:37:28,"- Is there a reason why it's three, DeBears?"
00:37:28,00:37:30,- I'm not sure I saw it on the Carl Pilkington idiot
00:37:30,00:37:31,of Broadway.
00:37:31,00:37:33,"- Oh my gosh, it was because you grew up in China."
00:37:33,00:37:35,(laughing)
00:37:35,00:37:37,- You know the hamburger originally meant
00:37:37,00:37:39,a bit of luggage for a man.
00:37:39,00:37:41,The original hamburger is worth a man.
00:37:41,00:37:42,- Yeah.
00:37:42,00:37:45,- And then it only became a women's specific item
00:37:45,00:37:47,"in 1841, I think, didn't it?"
00:37:47,00:37:47,"- Yeah, it's really recent."
00:37:47,00:37:49,- And do you know who invented it?
00:37:49,00:37:50,The guy who invented the hamburger
00:37:50,00:37:53,also invented butterscotch.
00:37:53,00:37:54,- Samil Parkinson.
00:37:54,00:37:55,- Yeah.
00:37:55,00:37:57,"- That is two cool things to invent, isn't it?"
00:37:57,00:37:58,- Yeah.
00:37:58,00:37:59,"- Yeah, it is cool."
00:37:59,00:38:01,"So he came in donkaster, it's from donkaster."
00:38:01,00:38:02,Well done donkaster.
00:38:02,00:38:03,- Is it?
00:38:03,00:38:04,- What about donkaster?
00:38:04,00:38:04,- It's from donkaster.
00:38:04,00:38:05,- Yeah.
00:38:05,00:38:06,- Well done.
00:38:06,00:38:07,"- And yeah, so he introduced handbags"
00:38:07,00:38:09,"as a women's item, specific women's item"
00:38:09,00:38:11,because before women only had those reticules
00:38:11,00:38:13,which are like those tiny drawstring bags
00:38:13,00:38:14,that you could basically fit an earring in.
00:38:14,00:38:16,And he said to you wrote to a designer
00:38:16,00:38:18,"and was like, ""My wife needs to travel on a train."""
00:38:18,00:38:21,- My wife from donkaster.
00:38:21,00:38:22,(laughing)
00:38:22,00:38:24,- So I looked up a few of the oldest things
00:38:24,00:38:27,that we know of in particular different fields.
00:38:27,00:38:28,- Okay.
00:38:28,00:38:29,- So the oldest copy of a gospel
00:38:29,00:38:32,was found inside the mask of a mummy.
00:38:32,00:38:33,- Oh.
00:38:33,00:38:34,- Wasn't that really recent?
00:38:34,00:38:34,- Wow.
00:38:34,00:38:35,- That was really recent.
00:38:35,00:38:36,"- Yeah, it was discovered."
00:38:36,00:38:38,"And it was basically, they made all these things out,"
00:38:38,00:38:39,"it was made out of papyrus,"
00:38:39,00:38:41,which was then basically turned into papier mache.
00:38:41,00:38:44,"And all kinds of different things were used,"
00:38:44,00:38:46,all kinds of texts were used to make mummy's masks.
00:38:46,00:38:49,So there were business papers and just personal letters
00:38:49,00:38:51,or biblical documents like the early gospel.
00:38:51,00:38:53,- Do you think it was for something for them to read?
00:38:53,00:38:55,(laughing)
00:38:55,00:38:57,"- Yeah, it was the Google Glass of its day."
00:38:57,00:38:59,(laughing)
00:38:59,00:39:01,"- Oh, that would be awful."
00:39:01,00:39:02,I'm getting so tired of this.
00:39:02,00:39:05,"- Yeah, and then you were in the beginning, yeah."
00:39:05,00:39:06,- Will somebody turn the page?
00:39:06,00:39:09,(laughing)
00:39:09,00:39:10,"- Sorry, go on."
00:39:10,00:39:13,"- And so Greek texts, things like ""Home is Odyssey"""
00:39:13,00:39:17,"would be used as the contents of a papier mache,"
00:39:17,00:39:18,papyrus mask.
00:39:18,00:39:19,- Wow.
00:39:19,00:39:20,- That's so strange.
00:39:20,00:39:21,Are you never think of that?
00:39:21,00:39:21,- No.
00:39:21,00:39:22,- What did they make it out of?
00:39:22,00:39:23,- Yeah.
00:39:23,00:39:24,"- Yeah, that's really cool."
00:39:24,00:39:26,"- The paper, it seems, they just use it."
00:39:26,00:39:28,- They can read it now by taking the mask apart.
00:39:28,00:39:32,"- It's like, today's headlines are tomorrow's papier mache"
00:39:32,00:39:33,mummy masks.
00:39:33,00:39:34,(laughing)
00:39:34,00:39:35,It's probably a saying in those days.
00:39:35,00:39:37,"- Yeah, and when you go to the fish and chip shop,"
00:39:37,00:39:38,"they give you a mummy's mask, we use it out."
00:39:38,00:39:41,(laughing)
00:39:41,00:39:45,- The world's oldest human footprints outside Africa.
00:39:45,00:39:46,- Anyone guesses on where they are?
00:39:46,00:39:47,"- Yeah, they're in there."
00:39:47,00:39:48,- Just on the board and leaving Africa.
00:39:48,00:39:51,(laughing)
00:39:53,00:39:55,- They're on a beach in England.
00:39:55,00:39:56,"- Yeah, they're in Norfolk."
00:39:56,00:39:57,"- Hang on, they're on a beach"
00:39:57,00:40:00,that what the tide just never came in and washed them away.
00:40:00,00:40:02,"- Basically, they, it's quite tricky."
00:40:02,00:40:04,"They were indentations in the,"
00:40:04,00:40:08,"not in the rock, but in the, it's--"
00:40:08,00:40:09,- Sand.
00:40:09,00:40:10,"- Yeah, it's not in the beach."
00:40:10,00:40:13,- It's not like the beach in the water is just misty.
00:40:13,00:40:13,(laughing)
00:40:13,00:40:14,"- Yeah, it's eight millions of you."
00:40:14,00:40:16,(laughing)
00:40:16,00:40:17,"- No, it's really hard."
00:40:17,00:40:19,"I read an entire article about this and it's kind of vague,"
00:40:19,00:40:21,but they were on the beach.
00:40:21,00:40:22,"They have now been washed away,"
00:40:22,00:40:25,"but they were indentations in the beach somehow,"
00:40:25,00:40:27,which resembled footprints.
00:40:27,00:40:28,"I have no idea how they dated them as well,"
00:40:28,00:40:29,but they are--
00:40:29,00:40:31,"- 800,000 years old, that's the amazing thing."
00:40:31,00:40:34,- I thought it was basically the idea of mud
00:40:34,00:40:36,and then the mud dried and kept them
00:40:36,00:40:39,"and then a beach, what they discovered was the sand"
00:40:39,00:40:41,on the beach kind of disappeared and revealed them.
00:40:41,00:40:43,"- Yes, that is exactly it."
00:40:43,00:40:47,"- 800,000, that is amazing."
00:40:47,00:40:50,- But the replaces in the UK where you can see footprints
00:40:50,00:40:53,"of dinosaurs in the same way, which have been like"
00:40:53,00:40:55,whether they are muds hardened.
00:40:55,00:40:56,- It's amazing. - It's amazing.
00:40:56,00:40:57,It's so cool.
00:40:57,00:41:00,And they only had a very short space of time
00:41:00,00:41:03,to get imprints of these before they were washed away
00:41:03,00:41:06,by rain and by the effects of the waves.
00:41:06,00:41:08,And there was one adult and five children with him.
00:41:08,00:41:10,"That's all we know about these footprints,"
00:41:10,00:41:13,this family or whoever it was.
00:41:13,00:41:14,Yeah. - How cool is that?
00:41:14,00:41:15,- It is good.
00:41:15,00:41:17,- So Dog's teeth were used as currency
00:41:17,00:41:21,in Papua New Guinea until as recently as 1960.
00:41:21,00:41:24,"- What? - Yeah, that's amazing."
00:41:24,00:41:29,"- In 1876, we know what you could get for so many teeth."
00:41:29,00:41:32,You could get a bride for a hundred dogs teeth.
00:41:32,00:41:34,That was like the price of a dowry.
00:41:34,00:41:35,- Wow.
00:41:35,00:41:38,"- I don't really, like there's not many there"
00:41:38,00:41:41,or I don't know really.
00:41:41,00:41:44,I guess. - 'Cause if you're going out for dinner
00:41:44,00:41:46,"and you're going, oh, we should probably pick up"
00:41:46,00:41:50,"a built-inite, how many dog teeth should we bring?"
00:41:50,00:41:53,Should we bring Rover with us in just in case?
00:41:53,00:41:55,"Like could you, was it special type of teeth?"
00:41:55,00:41:58,"- What I think it is, and I might be wrong about this,"
00:41:58,00:42:00,"but teeth have been, and animal bonds,"
00:42:00,00:42:04,especially been used forever as things to like cut
00:42:04,00:42:06,"or to, you know, they're useful tools"
00:42:06,00:42:08,'cause they're hard and you can do things.
00:42:08,00:42:10,So I reckon it's quite often currencies
00:42:10,00:42:12,are made out of things that are useful
00:42:12,00:42:14,and then they trade them and then they become a currency.
00:42:14,00:42:15,So I bet it's probably something like that.
00:42:15,00:42:17,"- Okay, that's interesting."
00:42:17,00:42:19,"- Although when you say a hundred dog's teeth,"
00:42:19,00:42:21,that is ambiguous.
00:42:21,00:42:22,Is it the teeth of a hundred dogs?
00:42:22,00:42:23,- Oh no.
00:42:23,00:42:24,- Or is it a hundred teeth?
00:42:24,00:42:25,- What is the apostrophe in that?
00:42:25,00:42:26,- What is the apostrophe?
00:42:26,00:42:29,"- Yeah, no, it's a hundred teeth."
00:42:29,00:42:30,- A hundred teeth.
00:42:30,00:42:30,- That come from dogs.
00:42:30,00:42:32,- So you don't want to accidentally murder a hundred dogs
00:42:32,00:42:35,and realize you only need to do three or something.
00:42:35,00:42:36,"- Darling, we're rich."
00:42:36,00:42:40,(all laughing)
00:42:40,00:42:41,- That's great.
00:42:41,00:42:42,- Have we got any more?
00:42:42,00:42:42,Should we wrap up?
00:42:42,00:42:43,"- Yeah, I've done."
00:42:43,00:42:45,- Oldest penis.
00:42:45,00:42:50,"In the world, the oldest penis is a hundred million years old."
00:42:50,00:42:51,- What?
00:42:51,00:42:53,- Is it a penis for dinosaurs?
00:42:53,00:42:55,"- It belonged to an ostracod,"
00:42:55,00:42:57,which is an early kind of crustacean
00:42:57,00:42:59,and it was found on a fossil of that
00:42:59,00:43:01,and some scientists found it
00:43:01,00:43:02,and they analyzed it.
00:43:02,00:43:04,One of them was Professor David Siviter
00:43:04,00:43:05,of the University of Leicester
00:43:05,00:43:07,and it was on a tiny marine creature
00:43:07,00:43:09,which was about one millimeter wide.
00:43:09,00:43:10,I'm not sure whether that was the penis
00:43:10,00:43:11,or the whole animal.
00:43:11,00:43:15,But the one millimeter penis on the...
00:43:15,00:43:16,- Oh my God.
00:43:16,00:43:18,"- It was drawn, it was the butter."
00:43:18,00:43:21,(all laughing)
00:43:21,00:43:24,"But he says that it doesn't have one penis, it has two."
00:43:24,00:43:26,So the earliest ever penis that we've got
00:43:26,00:43:28,is from an animal which had two of them.
00:43:28,00:43:29,- Wow.
00:43:29,00:43:30,- That's great.
00:43:30,00:43:31,- That's cool.
00:43:31,00:43:32,- Yeah.
00:43:32,00:43:33,- Nice.
00:43:33,00:43:34,- I like it.
00:43:34,00:43:35,"- Yeah, me too."
00:43:35,00:43:35,- I'll show you wrap up.
00:43:35,00:43:37,(upbeat music)
00:43:37,00:43:38,"- Okay, that's it."
00:43:38,00:43:39,That's all of our facts.
00:43:39,00:43:40,Thanks so much for listening.
