00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 (Theme song plays)

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Now, Lo and welcome to another episode of None Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Paris!

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 (Cheering and applause)

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Thank you very much, Marie and James Harkin, and once again we have gathered around the microphones

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 who are four favorite facts from the last seven days and in a particular order, here we go!

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Starting with you, James!

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Okay, my fact this week is that North American potcups sometimes fall out of trees and impale themselves of their own spice.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 So, they get pushed into them?

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Like, so they're ready to get us what impaled beans.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 (Laughter)

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Do they die?

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 We all die, aren't they?

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 (Laughter)

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 I don't think we're in Paris, I should've realised the philosophy would come early in the morning.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Well, actually, not usually, and the reason that we know about this for a few reasons, but it's kind of a report that came out by a guy called oldest Rose and his colleagues,

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 and they noticed that quilts have antibiotics on them, and they worked out that the reasons that they have antibiotics on them

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 is because they do impale themselves quite often, and it means that it will kind of get infected and it won't kill them.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 It is weird that they spend so much time up trees, and this is North American microbiome, isn't it?

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Yeah, they absolutely lot of climbing trees!

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Yeah, actually, a female potcupide is only interested in sex once a year, and she signals that by climbing the tree, urinating and screaming.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 (Laughter)

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 It's sexy.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 We all dry up.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 (Laughter)

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 But the males have urination as well in their mating, so the males, they can sometimes make the females receptive to mating, and the way they do that is urinating on them.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 And they have a special high velocity urine, which can go six feet.

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Wow.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 So even if a female is on a completely different branch, the male can spray her and then she will become fertile.

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 That's incredible.

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Yeah, is it true?

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 I might have this wrong, but is it true?

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 So there's a fight that happens between two males who are according the one, so the urination thing, as well as being an exciting thing for the mating ritual,

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 is also in the same way that a dog might pee on a fire hydrant to mark it as its territory.

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 It's a territory marking thing, I think, as well.

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 That feels slightly possible.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 Yeah, they're not really sure.

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 They think, yeah, it could be pheromones to attract them, but they do have this massive bite.

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 So, lots of males can get involved, because they're very solitary porky bites, and they have this very narrow window of fertility, the females.

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 And so they're on their own, middle of nowhere, there's something like, "Fuck, I'm fertile, so they have to do this whole screaming, weeing thing."

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 So it just spends urine in the air and hope the male smell it.

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 So then a bunch of males flock to them, and then they do have this huge bite.

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 And so it's very normal if you see a male porky by mating, he'll usually be doing it with a bunch of someone else's, some other porky finds quills sticking out of it.

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 Wow.

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Covered in other men's quills.

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 Wow.

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 Yeah, not comfortable.

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 No.

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 The female porky minds are pregnant or lactating for 11 months of the year, and they can be pregnant for all of their lives, and they live for 20 to 30 years.

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 So they basically spend their entire lives pregnant or breastfeeding.

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Why under the screaming so much?

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Why are they not more porky minds then?

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 They're just good at hiding from you.

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 I think they're not quite a lot.

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 If you're in a narrow group, I think you hear it quite a lot.

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 So what they have lots of quills, actually they have spines all over their penis as well at the males.

56
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 It's covered in what they call horny material.

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 It's a very common one.

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 But they've no, you know, the proper for humans is that they can stab us with their quills.

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 And there was a paper from 1955, which is all about being quilled by porky pines.

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 And this is our friends at improbable research.

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 So the guy who did the ignoble awards, which we mentioned before,

62
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 there was a paper in 1955 written by Albert R. Schabel, and in it he wrote,

63
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 "Many hundreds of quills have penetrated various parts of the author's own body in numbers of one or two to as many as 40 at one time.

64
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 On one occasion, 40 were driven into the forehead and the bridge of the nose by one stroke of a porky pint's tail.

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 They added, "The penetration of porky pint quills into the human body is never a pleasant sensation."

66
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 That's last time, speak.

67
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 We're thinking of trying it out.

68
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 They have really interesting sex organs, don't they?

69
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 Porky pines, the males have really interesting sex organs.

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 So they keep their testes inside them.

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 They don't let their testes into their scrotal sac for most of the year.

72
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 They're just sitting in their stomachs on my, not their stomach, their abdomen.

73
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 And then they just plop them down into the scrotal sac once they're going to mate.

74
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 And they suck them back up again when they're not mating.

75
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 But then they've got, as you said, their penis is fined.

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 But also, it's usually pointing backwards.

77
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 So it's in sort of a sheath that points backwards towards them.

78
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 So when they mate with the female, it flips out a pen knife.

79
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 Oh, wow.

80
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 That's amazing.

81
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 Yeah.

82
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 No wonder they keep their testes inside.

83
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 They'll probably be stabbing themselves otherwise while they're around.

84
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 That's probably just, yeah, protection.

85
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 There was a politician from Florida called Bobby Bean.

86
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 And he wanted to become a senator.

87
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 And he ran with the promise that he would make sex with Porcupines legal.

88
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 And how did he--

89
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 He's now president.

90
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 Did he, did he win?

91
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 No, he didn't win.

92
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 Actually, it wasn't quite as stupid as you might think.

93
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 His idea was to, he wants it to erase kind of useless laws that exist.

94
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 So it currently is illegal explicitly to have sex with Porcupines in Florida.

95
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 And he's like, you know, they have a pen knife spiky penis.

96
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 We're probably not going to do that.

97
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 And it's spiky on the outside, we probably don't eat this law.

98
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 And there was like other things like there was a rule against men wearing strapless gowns

99
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 that he wanted to get rid of as well.

100
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 So wrappers gowns, yeah.

101
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 Well, how's he going to seduce the Porcupines?

102
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 And they eat people's toilets sometimes.

103
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 What?

104
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 Porcupines.

105
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 They do.

106
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 They genuinely do.

107
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 Well, okay.

108
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 Let's have some qualification here.

109
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 So what they do, they love sodium.

110
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 So it's salt, basically.

111
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 And they need one of it.

112
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 They crave salt all the time.

113
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 And some people in the territory still have outdoor wooden toilets.

114
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 And a lot of the words, you know, if your aim is poor,

115
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 has urine soaked into it, okay?

116
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 So urine contains salt.

117
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 And, you know, people, there are toilets which have been eaten away at.

118
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 By Porcupines.

119
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 So they don't eat the porcelain, but they do eat the ceramic wood.

120
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 So they eat the hut.

121
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 Yeah, they do eat the hut.

122
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Yeah.

123
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 So boy scouts, I think on Boy Scout cats, they often say,

124
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 "You'll go to the loo and you're surrounded by Porcupines chewing through the hut."

125
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 They try that to say to urine.

126
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 Oh my gosh.

127
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 So you're really frightening.

128
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 But the salt love gets them into all sorts of trouble.

129
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 So they chew through cars a lot.

130
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 So cars are quite salty.

131
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 They genuinely do.

132
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 No, they don't.

133
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 They're coming from a toilet volume.

134
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 You'll draw the line at cars.

135
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 Very weird.

136
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 They actually chew through cars mostly in winter.

137
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 Can you guess why?

138
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 Salt on the roads.

139
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 Salt on the roads.

140
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 Did you read that?

141
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 Oh, great stuff.

142
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 And if you drink, it must be on the toes when you're driving along.

143
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 It gets on the toes, flicks up onto the engine.

144
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 And then they climb, they'll eat your engine out from the inside.

145
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 Wow.

146
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 Another thing that Dan, you might be interested in, is getting bones.

147
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 What?

148
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 What is this case?

149
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 Am I in some kind of weird fever dream?

150
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 What is on the toilets?

151
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 The cars are the yetis.

152
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 Yeah, we're just thinking about why we could push it.

153
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 There's a theory that's prevalent among people who believe in the Sasquatch,

154
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 which is the same as a yeti, right?

155
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 In the old style.

156
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 Absolutely not.

157
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 It's like talking a hedgehog in a pocket, you find the same thing.

158
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 It's insulting.

159
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 I'm sorry to the Sasquatch and the yeti communities.

160
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 So people even have Sasquatch.

161
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 People are often say to them, why aren't there any bones?

162
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 Why we never find any bones?

163
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 Yeah.

164
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 And they say, well, it's obviously because they're very salty and pocket finds a big one.

165
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 Yes.

166
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Yes.

167
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 Yes, there's something you believe in.

168
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 Yeah, that's a true fact that they believe in.

169
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 It's true.

170
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 And also, they say that in Canada, they don't actually put salt on the roads anymore,

171
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 speaking of salt, because big-foot keeps eating it all.

172
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 So they think, we're going to start with losing too much salt.

173
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 Really?

174
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Yeah, we should probably move on today.

175
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 Do you think of what we do?

176
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 We just do a couple of different requirements.

177
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 Oh, can I just do one more thing on pocket?

178
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 Yes.

179
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 Just really quickly, because it's that French person.

180
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 There was a 19th century French explorer called Jules Gerard,

181
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 who reported on a group of people called the Hatchichere,

182
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 they were from Algeria.

183
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 And all they ever did was smoke Hachiche and kill pocket bites.

184
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 I can't hear the smoke Hachiche and kill pocket bites.

185
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 And I've just finished my Hachiche.

186
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 Yeah.

187
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 But now I'm quite sleepy.

188
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 And we do need to move on to our next facts.

189
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 Just really quickly, because you know that fish can climb trees.

190
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 What?

191
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 Yeah, fish, coin trees, and loads of different types of fish.

192
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 So one of them is the mangrove kidney fish in mangrove forests.

193
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 And that exists in like lots of America, Florida and Brazil.

194
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Liz and puddles.

195
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 And then the puddles dry up.

196
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 At which point they actually climb up the nearest tree.

197
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 So it looks like a normal fish climbs its way up a tree.

198
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 And then it climbs into a hole in the tree,

199
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 then it's an insect made or an actual hole in a tree.

200
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 And it just waits it out in the hole until it rains again.

201
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 And it can wait in a tree for months.

202
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 So sometimes you're just walking off a tree and there's a fish halfway up.

203
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 We're hanging out with the urinating poultry pie.

204
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 It's very weird in the upper canopy.

205
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

206
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 My fact is that scientists are developing a t-shirt

207
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 which tells you when you smell.

208
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 This is really cool.

209
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 So there is a British microtrip maker,

210
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 and the firm is called Arm.

211
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 They are working on putting AI devices in clothes, basically.

212
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 So the idea is that you will have a microtrip in your armpit,

213
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 effectively, in your shirt, and it will inform you on scale of one to five.

214
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 How bad your body odor is and whether it may be it's time to have a shower

215
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 or change your clothes.

216
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 OK.

217
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 But if you change your clothes and you've lost the shirt that tells you,

218
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 I guess you have to change for another microtrip t-shirt.

219
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 Yeah, it's going to be quite an expensive endeavor.

220
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 Will the washing the clothes not make the microtrip?

221
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 Absolutely.

222
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 This is the key problem that they are trying to.

223
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 It's making a microtrip which will withstand repeated washing machines.

224
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 So you have no choice but to wear that one shirt.

225
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 Andy permanently on number five.

226
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 Yeah, it's all true.

227
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 I'm not saying it's free of problems, or I just don't know.

228
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 I do think it's a good idea.

229
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 There is a way, actually, to make clothes clean themselves.

230
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 So you can put some narrow particles in clothes and then clean themselves.

231
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 Scientists are using this to make robotic trousers for old people.

232
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 OK, so old people have trouble walking.

233
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 And they think if they can make these robotic trousers, it will help them to walk.

234
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 OK, nice thing.

235
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 Yeah.

236
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 Sounds dangerous to me.

237
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 I've seen the wrong trousers, but go on.

238
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 The thing is, they put these other particles in, which means they don't have to be washed.

239
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 So that's good for the electronics, but the problem is all the old people they give them to

240
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 said they would just wash them anyway.

241
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 OK.

242
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 That's the hard thing to get around, isn't it?

243
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 Yeah.

244
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 And there will be, just while we're on the smart clothes thing.

245
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 And there will perhaps one day soon, the underpants that you can use to control your home.

246
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 So this is really cool.

247
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 So this is not too far away.

248
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 Actually, we like turning light stuff and stuff, because I always want to slide in bed.

249
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 And I rolled up one of my socks and threw it at the light switch and turned the light side.

250
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 So my wife is not nearly as impressed as you guys.

251
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 James has been trying to get the story into the podcast for five years.

252
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 It's very impressive. I rolled up a sock, and you were on the other side of the room.

253
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 It wasn't like it was here.

254
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 No, your socks must be real hard.

255
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 If only you had microchips in your socks to tell you, please wash me.

256
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 So you would be able to get underpants that control your home.

257
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 OK, I'm determined to tell you about this.

258
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 So it basically just is more putting sensors in clothes.

259
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 So you will have sensors which measure your heart rate, your temperature,

260
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 your body temperature, or the temperature of your body inside your pants.

261
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 The pressure, the hydration.

262
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 What do you need that for?

263
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 Well, OK, well, here we go.

264
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 So you could connect your thermostat in your house.

265
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 You could link it up with your body temperature.

266
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 And when you're at home, it could notice.

267
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Oh, thanks feeling.

268
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 Thanks for passing through a bit hard.

269
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 I want to overheat it down a little bit.

270
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 And then you could think it's fair that we all have to live in a polarly cold house

271
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 because it's done.

272
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 It's done.

273
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 It's done.

274
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 It's done.

275
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 It's done.

276
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 It's done.

277
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 It's done.

278
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 Very pretty.

279
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 You know, you know my machine that follows your home is for you?

280
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 Well, there's, it's, it's, it was a kickstyle, though, I think.

281
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 It's called a faulty mate.

282
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 And I was watching a video.

283
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 So it's a massive machine, it's about as big as a person.

284
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 It's at the side of the fridge.

285
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 So I don't know where you're going to put it.

286
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 So next to your fridge?

287
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 The fridge?

288
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 You don't want to confuse them, though?

289
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 No, true.

290
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 I'll turn up with the appellate.

291
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 No, it's a folder, the pastor.

292
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 No, it's a folder, the pastor.

293
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 I'll turn up with the appellate.

294
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 No, it's a folder, the pastor.

295
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 I'll turn up with the appellate.

296
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 No, it's a folder, the pastor.

297
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 I'll turn up with the appellate.

298
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 No, it's a folder, the pastor.

299
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 I'll turn up with the appellate.

300
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 I'll turn up with the appellate.

301
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 No, it's a folder, the pastor.

302
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 I'll turn up with the appellate.

303
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 No, it's a folder, the pastor.

304
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 I'll turn up with the appellate.

305
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 No, it's a folder, the pastor.

 I'll turn up with the appellate.

307
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 No, it's a folder, the pastor.

308
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 I'll turn up with the appellate.

 I'll turn up with the appellate.

634
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 That's amazing.

635
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 You know the movie Armageddon?

636
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 Yes.

637
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 There's been some research recently done by some scientists

638
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 where they did a simulation to see how well that would have worked

639
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 if Bruce Willis had actually nuked it like he does in the movie

640
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 and it splits apart.

641
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 And what they discovered in simulation was that it would break apart

642
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 like it does in the movie.

643
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Unfortunately, the gravity is so great that it would just be pulled back together

644
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 and there's one solid asteroid and just wipe us out.

645
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 That's how the movie should have ended.

646
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 And this is a new discovery, isn't it?

647
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 Yeah.

648
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 Because last year when they ran the simulation, and this really is the top people

649
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 that NASA and all these other organizations have, last year when they ran it,

650
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 they did save Tokyo from the asteroid by doing a nuclear explosion,

651
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 which blew it apart.

652
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 But since then, yeah, they've just go, well, they'll just suck themselves back together

653
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 and keep coming at us.

654
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 So there are also some other weird ways of diverting asteroids.

655
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 So I really like the mass driver way, which basically is the idea that you would,

656
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 it's quite slow working, so you need to know that the asteroid was going to hit you

657
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 in about 100 years' time.

658
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 Oh, right.

659
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 Yeah.

660
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 You've got to pass them a little on to your grandchildren.

661
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 But the idea, basically, is that you get onto the servers of the asteroid,

662
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 you get some landing objects onto it, and they pick up rocks from the asteroids

663
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 and they just throw them at the Earth.

664
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 And the motion of that pushes the asteroid away from the Earth.

665
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 So it's kind of like, imagine if you're sitting on a swing, I guess,

666
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 and you've got a tennis ball.

667
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 And then if you throw the tennis ball away, you'll kind of go backwards on the swing, right?

668
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 It's the opposite, even when I'm on the reaction balls.

669
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 So if enough bits of rock are thrown at the Earth and the asteroid,

670
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 it'll sort of slow it down.

671
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 But then if too many are thrown at us, then we die anyway from the things you've thrown at us.

672
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 Yeah, you have to make sure they're not too big, though, bits of rock.

673
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 Yeah.

674
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 Wow.

675
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 And you need 100 years?

676
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 You need 100 years, yes.

677
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 I think, previously, Dan said that the warning we would have is about one second.

678
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 Look, you've not said that.

679
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 It's not true.

680
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 Well, we know about loads.

681
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 This is a really cool thing.

682
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 So NASA, apparently, knows about 795,000 asteroids.

683
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 So can I just say, like, for instance, the Chelepins meteor,

684
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 we didn't know about that at all until it landed.

685
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 So it might be that we have no seconds.

686
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 So I was wrong by one second.

687
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 But this is the amazing thing.

688
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 And the problem is, it's really hard to keep track of them, once you've spotted them.

689
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 So scientists have lost more than 900 near-Earth asteroids.

690
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 As in, they've spotted ones.

691
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 We thought, oh, that's a bit worrying.

692
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 And then we don't know what they've gone.

693
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 Wow, really?

694
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 Yeah, so we saw them once.

695
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 And because sometimes it takes 20 hours to confirm that what you're seeing is right.

696
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 Sometimes the weather is bad, so you can't see it again from a ground-based observatory.

697
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 So you just sort of say, oh, well, there.

698
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 See you.

699
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 I think it's gross.

700
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 Don't come back.

701
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 And we're going to have to move on to our final factor.

702
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 Some things killed by asteroids might have been the dinosaurs.

703
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 Okay.

704
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 And again, I didn't really say that since it's very well.

705
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 But I think all the points were there.

706
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 But there is one guy who doesn't think that.

707
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 There's a guy called Professor Brian J. Ford.

708
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 And he thinks that the dinosaurs actually died out because of a lack of sex legs.

709
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 Sex legs.

710
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 Sex legs.

711
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 Sex legs.

712
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 Damn, how's your crotch beard getting any hotter?

713
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 Well, it is sex legs.

714
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 It's exactly what it sounds like.

715
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 Go.

716
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 So his theory is that because dinosaurs were so big, they wouldn't be able to have sex,

717
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 because they would just crush each other.

718
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 That's not the only way they could do it is by using the legs to be buoyant.

719
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 And then, do you know what I mean?

720
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 They can only have sex with legs.

721
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 And he says that as the continent's drifted, there were loads of shallow,

722
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 there used to be loads of shallow legs and the word shallow legs anymore,

723
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 which is true.

724
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 And so he thinks because of those lack of shallow legs, all the dinosaurs died out.

725
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 Actually, this would mean that all the fossils we find would be crushed dinosaurs

726
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 underneath their crushing mate.

727
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 Yeah, you're right.

728
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 It's just a theory.

729
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 It's a great theory.

730
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 One thing about asteroid names.

731
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 Oh, yeah.

732
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 So asteroids, it used to be the near-death objects,

733
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 and most of which asteroids had to be named after mythical creatures,

734
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 but there have been loads and loads found since that was decided, I think, about 50 years ago.

735
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 So, it also used to be that they had to be named after things from mythology,

736
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 but they couldn't have creation or underworld themes,

737
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 because there was, for other bits of space.

738
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 So you have to really do your research into your biological creature.

739
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 Anyway, so these rules were kind of loose,

740
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 because there are like tens of thousands of them that have names now.

741
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 So if you, I was looking at the name of the massive list of asteroid names,

742
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 and you have these really grand ones like Palace and Juno and Achilles,

743
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 and then you have Bill Smith and Sarah Jenkins,

744
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 Donald Anderson, Randy Peterson,

745
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 and I was looking for our names in them.

746
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 So there are a lot of annas, so there's an anna just anna on her own,

747
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 and then they're like, you know, annas.

748
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 Oh, that's the one that's going to get us, isn't there?

749
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 I'm reading for her.

750
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 There's also a James on his own, and a Daniel on his own,

751
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 but there is no Andrew and Andy.

752
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 Right, thanks a lot.

753
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 So, I think the next asteroid name you should claim it.

754
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 Oh, we can name a sex lake after you.

755
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 Yes.

756
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 So I'd like to be remembered.

757
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 Time for our final fact on the show, and that is my fact.

758
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 My fact this week is that until the 1840s,

759
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 there was no maximum size for a rugby team.

760
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 So, matches were sometimes played with up to 300 players on the pitch at the same time.

761
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 So is that an 150 against 150?

762
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 No, 29 against what?

763
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 He's very good.

764
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 We do have an example of it, so the game of rugby was set to have been invented

765
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 in a school called rugby, hence where it got the same from, in 1823.

766
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 There was a match played in 1839 where rugby school house had 75 players,

767
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 so that was their team, and they played a team that was called the rest.

768
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 And there was 225 people.

769
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 That's amazing.

770
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 Do we know who won?

771
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 I don't actually know who won, I couldn't find out.

772
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 I'm sure it's out there somewhere, but yeah.

773
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 And it was obviously, it was a very chaotic game, as you can imagine.

774
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 They hadn't really got any rules to begin with, rules slowly kind of.

775
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 Actually, it is to be like basically a load of guys in the field,

776
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 just trying to get the ball from one end to the other, but with no rules, right?

777
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 Yeah.

778
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 It's just basically one big scrub.

779
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 Strangling and throttling were outlawed in 1862.

780
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 That's when I went right off the game.

781
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 That's just health and safety gone mad in the end, isn't it?

782
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 But this is, yeah, because these go back hundreds of years, don't they?

783
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 They're all comes from games which are called folk football.

784
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 So there's one that's still played in England in Derbyshire in Ashburn,

785
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 where you keep playing until you score a goal or until 10pm,

786
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 which ever comes sooner, just knock off.

787
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 Because people would die quite often.

788
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 And there are lots of records of people dying playing rugby,

789
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 partly because people used to carry knives in cheats on their belts.

790
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 And so you might just run into someone else's knife by mistake.

791
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 That hammer, that's a foul.

792
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 But this is the other thing.

793
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 The game of rugby is problematic, because it lets people take revenge on each other,

794
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 because there are no rules.

795
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 So if you've got a village of people basically having a big fight,

796
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 you could just say, "Oh, yeah, you ran under my knife."

797
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 Where was this? This happened?

798
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 This is sort of 14th, 15th centuries.

799
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 Right.

800
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 So this is the four proper rugby.

801
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 Yeah, yeah.

802
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 Because there was one corner.

803
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 I wonder if this is what you're talking about.

804
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 Caltio's Thorikot?

805
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 Well, that's a very similar game.

806
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

807
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 I mean, that, like, what I'm saying, it's a rugby game.

808
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 But the idea is to play rugby, but also just kick each other's ass.

809
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 Really badly.

810
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 Like, you're allowed to punch kick, headbutt, elbow, choking is permitted.

811
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 There's no clubs allowed, you know, to soften the punch.

812
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 And the amazing thing.

813
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 And there would be deaths, and they would just carry on and so on.

814
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 But the main thing was, if the game was going a bit too slow,

815
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 and they wanted the fans to sort of have a bit more of a fast experience

816
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 and get the game done, they'd just let some balls come in.

817
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 So they just ran the balls, running around attacking humans.

818
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 I mean, it sounds incredible.

819
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 Yeah, that's Italy, isn't it?

820
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 Caltio, yeah.

821
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 This presumably was recently.

822
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 They're not going to soften it now.

823
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 Yeah.

824
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 You're allowed to do everything except kick people in the head.

825
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 And who's telling the balls not to do that?

826
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 Well, even in rugby, kicking used to be, um, shin kicking specifically,

827
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 used to be massively caught in the game.

828
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 So this is one of the biggest controversies rugby ever saw,

829
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 was when they were drawing out the rules.

830
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 It was, like, in the 1870s.

831
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 And hacking was really part of rugby, which was basically really,

832
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 vigorously kicking someone else's shins.

833
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 And somebody wanted to outlaw it.

834
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 And somebody will say, "That's going to ruin the game."

835
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 It's kind of it.

836
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 But it was the case that, like, after a scrubber broken up,

837
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 everyone else had let the balls, the other end of the pitch.

838
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 You still have apparently, just you have two players left over,

839
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 kicking each other in the shin, really hard,

840
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 at the other end of the pitch.

841
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 So then people used to wear sharpened boots with spikes on them

842
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 to really get that shin kick as good as it could be.

843
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 Well, yeah.

844
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 And then they would wear white trousers to show off the blood.

845
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 This was a mark of...

846
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 This is the English school system.

847
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 It was first, basically.

848
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 Although I was ready.

849
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 And then rugby moved to France, to other countries.

850
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 And in the late 19th century in France, once we did have rules,

851
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 but rugby wasn't seen not so much as a team game,

852
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 the more of an individual game.

853
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 There was still a team, but you were trying to see how well

854
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 you could do yourself.

855
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 And so it was, like, one athlete against the group.

856
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 And you were trying to get around them.

857
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 So basically, players were reluctant to get dirty,

858
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 reluctant to find themselves on the ground.

859
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 And they thought it was less cleverest to get involved in scrubs.

860
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 And this only was challenged when France played England in 1906.

861
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 And fabled out of the English, was not played by those rules at all.

862
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 Actually, one of the objections to getting rid of the shin kicking

863
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 was, I read, and I don't know what this means.

864
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 And just don't shoot the messenger.

865
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 But so this is hacking when it was going to be banned.

866
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 And the secretary of Black Heath FC said,

867
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 "We can't ban the practice of kicking each other in the shins

868
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 because it will do away with all the courage and pluck of the game

869
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 and bring over a lot of Frenchmen."

870
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 Wow.

871
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 You really, really know your audience so well.

872
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 So when it took off, they eventually,

873
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 I think it was the 1870s going to take.

874
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 Whole football club said, "Okay, fine.

875
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 We'll stop each other kicking in the shins with sharp and booze."

876
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 But you're still allowed to trip up the man who's running.

877
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 That was just a nice little innovation.

878
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 They thought they were trying.

879
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 Nice.

880
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 Yeah.

881
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 Oh, if you thought the rugby balls could give you as well.

882
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 Good thing.

883
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 Yeah, but not the way you would think.

884
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 Oh, I didn't have a thought in my head.

885
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 Nice thing.

886
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 Okay, so they hit you in the head so hard that you die.

887
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 Brilliant.

888
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 That's not the way that you would think.

889
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 Good.

890
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 Okay, it's not that way.

891
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 So rugby balls, the first person to make a uniform oval rugby ball

892
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 was a guy called Richard Linden.

893
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 And his wife actually was involved in the manufacturing too.

894
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 So what it was was you would have a pig's bladder

895
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 and you had to blow that up and then surround it in leather.

896
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 That's just how you made the ball.

897
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 But Linden's wife Rebecca was the one who did the actual blowing up

898
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 and she contracted a lung disease and she died from it

899
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 because there wasn't an unexpectedly, you know, there was an infected bladder.

900
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 And she had had 17 children for him as well by him, you know.

901
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 This is a very sad story.

902
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 And so that determined him to make a rubber bladder.

903
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 It basically prompted the innovation of...

904
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 And he also invented the modern pump.

905
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 Yes.

906
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 Sorry near syringe and he thought, well, I could take that from an ear and plate.

907
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 For more than that.

908
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 Yeah, for more than that.

909
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 Yeah, for more than that.

910
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 But who was looking after all those kids?

911
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 Well, he was inventing these silly rugby ball base things.

912
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 That's my question.

913
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 What I've read about rugby does not relate.

914
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 Probably something.

915
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 Just a tiny little nugget of how influential this little rugby school in England

916
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 has been on global sporting outside of inventing rugby itself.

917
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 There was a student there who was from Australia called Thomas Willes.

918
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 He went back to Australia and he invented Aussie rules.

919
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 Which back in Australia is a huge sport.

920
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 It's not gone global.

921
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 In fact, they have Australia have an old star Aussie rules team

922
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 that they announce every year.

923
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 But because no one is good enough to play them, they've never played a match.

924
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 So we've got this like super group who just get announced and they meet up.

925
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 But that's it.

926
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 They should play the rest.

927
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 Yes.

928
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 That's such a good point.

929
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 So rugby is known for having really hard core players playing it, I guess.

930
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 So my favourite story is Wayne Shelford.

931
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 She was quite famous for being particularly hard core.

932
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 He was captain of the All Blacks in the 80s.

933
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 He and one of his got fan in.

934
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 Or maybe that's him.

935
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 I don't know.

936
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 It sounded like him based on what I'm about to tell you.

937
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 (Laughter)

938
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 It's just a banana.

939
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 So he has come to the All Blacks.

940
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 Very hard core.

941
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 In one of his very first games, he was super young.

942
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 He had French, he was playing France and a French boot ripped open his scrotum

943
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 and let a testicle hang in three.

944
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 He also had four teeth knocked out in the same incident.

945
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 But he didn't want to leave the pitch.

946
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 Anyone else has just been sucked up by important hours.

947
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 (Laughter)

948
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 Also, that's how the kick that gets your testicles on your team.

949
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 (Laughter)

950
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 And let's go kick top with such force if I put it to your hand.

951
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 It's telling these testicles without long.

952
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 But he just said that the video quick, so it up, so it up,

953
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 so it up, so it up right there and then and he kept on playing.

954
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 What?

955
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 We're not going to be made.

956
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 Yeah?

957
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 I'm telling you that he was not unconscious later on.

958
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 (Laughter)

959
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 We're going to have to wrap up shortly.

960
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 I'm going to have to stitch a stitch.

961
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 A testicle with podcast back into the scrotum of the microphone box.

962
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 I thought that was never going to end.

963
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 (Laughter)

964
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 Anything else before we wrap up?

965
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 I just have my big rugby story,

966
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 aside from the testicle ripping, maybe, is the story of the dultristic gladiators.

967
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 I don't know if you know this one, so dultristic gladiators were a team in the year 2000

968
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 and they were an amateur over 40s, very unfit rugby team,

969
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 who just played sort of amateur games for fun.

970
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 And then they thought they would make, so they thought they'd go to Romania for kind of a big bruise-up and play some rugby over there.

971
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 And they were giving some toys to an orphanage, actually, to be fair.

972
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 (Laughter)

973
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 Anyway, they were in Romania, and the Romania's got winner.

974
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 There was a rugby team there, and they were invited to play a game.

975
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 And so they were like more playing game with the local remains in the local park.

976
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 And there'd been some sort of mistranslation, and so Romania thought that they were basically a national level team.

977
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 (Laughter)

978
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 And so when they turned up, they realised it was in their national stadium.

979
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 It was being broadcast on television.

980
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 (Laughter)

981
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 There were thousands of spectators there, and they were playing against the Romanian national team.

982
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 (Laughter)

983
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 They did say, "We did get a bit suspicious when they offered us a training session night before, and we refused to do that, as we do our pre-match. We'll mub in the bar."

984
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 (Laughter)

985
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 But I think before the match, apparently, the Romanian's were all training,

986
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 and the Brits, where they were looking at them and smoking on the sidewalk.

987
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 (Laughter)

988
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 The Romanian's took pity and only beat them 60/17 out of sympathy in the end.

989
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 (Laughter)

990
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,200
 Okay, that is it that is all of our facts. Thank you.

991
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,200
