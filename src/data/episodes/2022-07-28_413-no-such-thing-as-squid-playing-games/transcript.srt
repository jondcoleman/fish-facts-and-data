1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:15,020
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,780
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast,

4
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,040
 this week coming to you live from New York.

5
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,780
 (crowd cheering)

6
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,740
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

7
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,060
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

8
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,580
 Andrew Humpton Murray, and James Harkin.

9
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,940
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

10
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,260
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

11
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,480
 And in no particular order, here we go.

12
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,100
 Starting with fact number one, and that is James.

13
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,860
 - Okay, my fact this week is that actually,

14
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,820
 squids don't play games.

15
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,580
 (crowd laughing)

16
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,540
 It's not so much a fact as a passive aggressive message

17
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:02,380
 to Netflix.

18
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:04,700
 (crowd laughing)

19
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,740
 - Oh yeah, got their IMDB ratings

20
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,300
 when James Harkin gets onto it.

21
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,420
 - I think you will find.

22
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,660
 - Is that show anything to do with squid playing games?

23
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:15,900
 - No. - Have you rumbled them?

24
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,540
 No, right? - I haven't, no.

25
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,580
 - It's just a silly thing.

26
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,780
 Basically, I was reading about play

27
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,660
 and about games and the evolution of playing.

28
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,540
 And I wanted to see what animals do play

29
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,660
 and what animals don't play, and for obvious reasons,

30
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,860
 I thought I'd see if squid play games.

31
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,740
 And I found an article in the Journal of Current Biology

32
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:37,140
 called Fun and Play in Invertebrates by Sarah Zelinski.

33
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,220
 And she says there is no evidence in play

34
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:42,060
 for cuttlefish or squids as defined

35
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,940
 by Berghardt's five criteria.

36
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,740
 So there's like these criteria you use in biology

37
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,140
 to find out if someone's playing

38
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,660
 or if something is playing, I should say.

39
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:52,360
 So it's, they do something that's not functional.

40
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,300
 They do it voluntarily.

41
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,540
 They do it different to the way they normally do it.

42
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,180
 So it's slightly changed.

43
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,500
 They repeat it and they do it when they're not under stress.

44
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,220
 And if they do all those things, then that counts as play.

45
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,780
 - It's interesting that not under stress

46
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,340
 is a criteria for play,

47
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,860
 because I think I was pretty stressed

48
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,780
 throughout the playground years.

49
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,340
 (audience laughing)

50
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,660
 - You weren't playing when people were holding you down

51
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,500
 on the floor and--

52
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,620
 - I was working, avoiding being it.

53
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,820
 And it was hard, and I lost all the time.

54
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,020
 - And I suppose one kind of interesting thing about that

55
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,540
 is most invertebrates don't,

56
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,180
 so invertebrates things without a backbone.

57
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,900
 Most of them don't play,

58
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,940
 but octopuses that are very closely related to squid,

59
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:31,780
 they do play.

60
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,900
 So it's kind of interesting

61
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,700
 that those two related things do.

62
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,340
 - And so have we, you know, had them in tanks

63
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,380
 and sort of like plop chestboards down

64
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,980
 and sort of like monopoly?

65
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,300
 Like have we actively tried to get them to play?

66
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,980
 - Monopoly.

67
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:46,820
 - No, they don't do that,

68
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,340
 but they, you know, they've studied them

69
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,660
 many times over the years.

70
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,260
 And with things like octopuses,

71
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,500
 they've just noticed that they happen to do this.

72
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,980
 So octopuses will,

73
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,980
 they'll kind of get like a little crab.

74
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,140
 And when they're full,

75
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,260
 so they don't want to eat the crab,

76
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,060
 they'll do it like a cat does with a mouse,

77
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,660
 so they'll catch it,

78
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,620
 and then they'll let it go

79
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,620
 and go a little bit further,

80
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,100
 and then they'll catch it again and stuff like that.

81
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,380
 So that counts as playing,

82
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,300
 'cause it's just for fun.

83
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,700
 It's like not exactly the same as catching a crab,

84
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,940
 but it's very slightly similar to catching crabs.

85
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:14,780
 - Yeah.

86
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:18,820
 - I feel like squid have a bit of a reputation

87
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,700
 as kind of the poor cousin of the octopus,

88
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,540
 'cause the octopus is so charismatic,

89
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,860
 it's so intelligent.

90
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,220
 We keep being told they're as intelligent

91
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,420
 as a bright 12-year-old.

92
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,620
 They could do GCSEs, all of this,

93
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,300
 and squid are sort of the...

94
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,860
 - Like a good bully Andy in the playground.

95
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,660
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

96
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,180
 And squid are kind of the thick cousins,

97
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,340
 and they're just good for calamari,

98
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,100
 but they're brilliant.

99
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:40,940
 They're really brilliant.

100
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,980
 And there are so many varieties of squid as well.

101
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,700
 So one of them I found out

102
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,780
 in the course of this squid game thing,

103
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,780
 Grimel de Tuthis bonplandi, okay?

104
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,860
 This is a particular kind of squid.

105
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,180
 And it is a squid which uses a squid

106
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,060
 within a squid method of catching prey.

107
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,740
 It is so cool.

108
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,020
 It has these tentacles, right?

109
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:01,860
 - Yeah.

110
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,660
 - And nice long tentacles.

111
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,340
 And they look in low light,

112
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,020
 and it swims in an area of the sea with quite low light.

113
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,460
 In low light, the ends of these tentacles

114
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,780
 look like baby squid, okay?

115
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,900
 And they leer in predators.

116
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,700
 And it flaps them around like a baby squid,

117
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,620
 bobbing around helplessly.

118
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,660
 And it leers in predators,

119
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,020
 the kind of predators which like to eat baby squid.

120
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:23,540
 And then, ah-ha-ha, it eats the predators

121
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,740
 which turn up expecting a helpless baby squid.

122
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,060
 - That's right. - It turns out it's attached

123
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,660
 to this gigantic squid. - But it might be quite confusing

124
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,020
 if like your hand looked like your child.

125
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,180
 Would that not be weird?

126
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,020
 - Yeah.

127
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,180
 - Like you might accidentally feed it

128
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,620
 or put a nappy on it or something?

129
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,460
 - True.

130
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,300
 - I think it's more like

131
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,300
 they're just doing finger puppet shows to each other,

132
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,740
 which is just really entertaining.

133
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,460
 - But lethal finger puppet shows, you know?

134
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,300
 - Yeah, sure.

135
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,700
 Where you eat the audience at the end.

136
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,540
 That's how mine always went.

137
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,980
 It's a good, yeah, they are great.

138
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,860
 So there's one squid called,

139
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,580
 confusingly called Octopoteuthis deletron,

140
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,420
 but it's a squid not an octopus.

141
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,780
 And it's, I think it's the only squid they've found so far

142
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,820
 that intentionally rips off its arms.

143
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,660
 And it does it to defend or attack.

144
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,500
 And this--

145
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,340
 - What?

146
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,180
 How?

147
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,700
 - So attack, does he rip off an arm

148
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,900
 and hit someone with it?

149
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,860
 - I think it's more like distraction.

150
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,180
 - Rather than-- - That would be distracting.

151
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,700
 - If you're in the middle of a boxing fight

152
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,020
 with Chris Eubank Jr. and he pulls his arm off,

153
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:17,860
 you'd be like, what?

154
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,780
 Yeah, and then he could clock you in the head

155
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,460
 with the other arm still attached.

156
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,740
 But it's gonna be his last fight.

157
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,820
 So, yeah, this woman was studying them

158
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,940
 and a quarter of these squid have at least one blunt arm.

159
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,940
 A lot of, as in an arm, which was missing a bit.

160
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,020
 And they can ditch them at any kind of joint.

161
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,380
 They can ditch them at various bits up the arm.

162
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,460
 So you only need to drop the bit that's being threatened.

163
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,300
 And it's so cool.

164
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,100
 This researcher was called Stephanie Bush.

165
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,740
 And she collected a bunch of squid

166
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,780
 to put in tanks in her lab.

167
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:48,100
 And loads of them immediately shed their arms at her

168
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:48,940
 trying to get away.

169
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,660
 And she said there was one of them,

170
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,220
 which was when in the lab,

171
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,940
 it grasped the bottom of the container

172
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,900
 with its arm hooks.

173
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,260
 They've got little hooks on their arms.

174
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:59,140
 It somersaulted repeatedly and released ink

175
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:02,060
 as it detached part of all eight of its arms.

176
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,380
 - Whoa! - And as they released the arms,

177
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,420
 they flashed 'cause, you know,

178
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,940
 they can emit their own light squids.

179
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,620
 So all the arms got released

180
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,620
 and then flashed lightning bolts through the water.

181
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,140
 - That is amazing. - This is horrifying.

182
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,300
 - They're also one of the few squid that has a penis.

183
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,740
 - Yeah. - The octopotuthis diletron,

184
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,860
 was it? - Yes.

185
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,340
 - So yeah, they have a penis

186
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,060
 and they have sex by depositing sperm

187
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,020
 on the body of the females, the males do.

188
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,140
 Although I say females,

189
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,620
 actually they're pretty indiscriminate

190
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,140
 because they live where it's quite dark

191
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:36,380
 and researchers have looked at all the different squids

192
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,340
 that have squid semen on them.

193
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,660
 And it's pretty much 50/50 male and female.

194
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,500
 - Right. - They'll just,

195
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,620
 if they see a squid, they'll go for it.

196
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,860
 - Oh, cool. - They're desperate.

197
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,620
 - Yeah, that's amazing.

198
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,300
 - A lot of these squid go their whole lives

199
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,180
 without meeting another squid.

200
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,820
 - Really? - This is why they're so desperate, yeah.

201
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,580
 So when they see one, you can't blame them.

202
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,380
 - Right, oh god. - It's kind of sad.

203
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,780
 - Have, you know, have a chat first or, you know,

204
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,980
 some, a drink and just go straight in for the shag.

205
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,060
 - Yeah, fair.

206
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,300
 - I was looking up squid games

207
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,860
 and I actually found something the opposite

208
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,700
 to what we're talking about,

209
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,740
 which is humans trying to get squids in competition.

210
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,460
 So there's an all-England squid championship that takes place.

211
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:20,380
 - That's amazing. - That's an annual championship.

212
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,380
 So what this is, is there's 74 competitors that go out

213
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,980
 and they spend five hours hoping to catch

214
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,300
 over 100 squids during the course of the day.

215
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,420
 - Five hours. - And then, yeah,

216
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,740
 they find the longest one.

217
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:35,740
 In 2012, it was won by a guy called David,

218
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,420
 who was a reigning champion.

219
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,740
 He'd won the previous year.

220
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,940
 But in 2012, there was terrible weather conditions

221
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,580
 and it was really, really rainy

222
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,220
 and no one was catching any squids.

223
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,860
 And he happened to notice, just before he was sending

224
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,900
 his reel back out, that right on the tip of his little hook

225
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:56,100
 was a tiny squid, a third of an inch long,

226
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,420
 and it was the only squid caught that year.

227
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:03,140
 So the 2012 winner of the all-England squid championship

228
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,980
 was a third of an inch long. - You know what,

229
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,660
 I want to watch that documentary

230
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,180
 and put it on Netflix called Squid Game 2.

231
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:13,860
 - No one must have believed that squid

232
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,100
 when it got back to its friends

233
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:18,460
 and said, "Guys, I just won Squid of the year."

234
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,780
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

235
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:22,380
 - He would have got Seaman all over him

236
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,100
 from every rich way with me.

237
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,020
 - Well, while we're on that.

238
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,700
 - Well, good.

239
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,460
 And we were obviously going to be at some point.

240
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,420
 - At some point, at some point.

241
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,260
 Let's get there now.

242
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,420
 - The northern pygmy squid, did you hear about this?

243
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,260
 - Oh, yeah.

244
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,940
 - So this is a squid where the female

245
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,140
 fertilizes her own eggs, okay?

246
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,220
 It's bizarre.

247
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:45,580
 So, as James said, the male kind of attaches the sperm

248
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,940
 to the body of the female.

249
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,260
 So it's not a kind of mating as we would understand it,

250
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,100
 but the sperm--

251
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,020
 - Yeah, so you would understand it maybe.

252
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,460
 (audience laughing)

253
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,500
 I like my sperm to spot it on my shoulder.

254
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,980
 And you know, I can dip in whenever I like.

255
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,820
 - Well.

256
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,540
 (audience laughing)

257
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,380
 - I don't know.

258
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,220
 Female choice.

259
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,540
 (audience laughing)

260
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,420
 - I'm just going to cut that out, by the way.

261
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,140
 And when Dan goes, "Fact number two, Anna Tyshinski,"

262
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,900
 it'll just be like, "My fact is,

263
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,900
 I like Seaman on the back of my shoulder."

264
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,540
 (audience laughing)

265
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,620
 - It's just less effort.

266
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,460
 Sorry, Andy.

267
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,300
 - No, no, no, no.

268
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,820
 (audience laughing)

269
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,220
 - Well, you would fit in like a charm

270
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,060
 into the northern pygmy squid society, Anna,

271
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,380
 because the male attaches the sperm to the female,

272
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,940
 and then it goes through.

273
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,980
 It sort of gets into her body somehow.

274
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,340
 I'm not exactly clear on the mechanism,

275
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,420
 but it gets into the female's mouth

276
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,300
 when she's ready to inseminate.

277
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,820
 And then she bites a hole in each of her eggs

278
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:47,140
 and just deposits a bit, squirts a bit of sperm,

279
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,140
 into each of the eggs to fertilize the eggs.

280
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:49,980
 - Oh, wow.

281
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,100
 - So she is doing the fertilizing at that point.

282
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:52,940
 Bizarre.

283
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:53,780
 - That's very cool.

284
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:57,940
 That's like in Vecho, or it's like a test tube baby.

285
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,460
 - Kind of, yeah, yeah, yeah.

286
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,300
 - Those guys are pretty cool.

287
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,260
 They have like a sticky patch on their back.

288
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,260
 And when they're kind of swimming around,

289
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,100
 if they get tired,

290
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,260
 they can just stick themselves to a bit of seaweed.

291
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,100
 - Wow. - And they just watch

292
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,100
 things go past.

293
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,740
 - That's great. - And then unstick themselves

294
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,780
 and then swim around again.

295
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,100
 - That's so cool, so fun.

296
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,620
 - And we say they don't play.

297
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,460
 Come on.

298
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,300
 - Yeah.

299
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,020
 - Did you guys ever do a fly wall when you were kids,

300
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,500
 where you would do a somersault against a Velcro wall?

301
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,460
 That's just like that.

302
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,540
 - No, well, we didn't have a Velcro wall in our house,

303
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,380
 sadly.

304
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,220
 (audience laughing)

305
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,580
 - What wall did you keep your Velcro wall in?

306
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,540
 - It was next to the bouncy castle drawing room.

307
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,540
 (audience laughing)

308
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,620
 So on actually how they reproduce,

309
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,780
 there's this really interesting thing

310
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,820
 that they've recently discovered,

311
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,940
 which is it's about the egg mops.

312
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,980
 So I quite like this,

313
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,420
 that when the female deposits all her fertilized eggs,

314
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,420
 they're called mops,

315
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,100
 and they're in these big piles,

316
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,980
 and she sticks them to the ground.

317
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:52,300
 And then male squid are attracted to these.

318
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,500
 And that doesn't really make any sense,

319
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,740
 because they've already been fertilized,

320
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,060
 so they're no use to the males.

321
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,260
 But what it means is there are fertile females

322
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,380
 in the vicinity,

323
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,220
 'cause they tend to kind of hang out together.

324
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,060
 And not only this,

325
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,540
 the male squid are attracted to the egg mops,

326
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,260
 and then they come up to the egg mops,

327
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,740
 and they kind of hug them,

328
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,980
 very weird, and sort of stroke the eggs.

329
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,860
 And we didn't really know why they were doing this,

330
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,980
 but it turns out that there's a chemical on the eggs,

331
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,260
 and as soon as the male squid sort of stroke

332
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,280
 and hug the eggs,

333
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,220
 they get this chemical on their arms,

334
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,740
 and it turns them into like raging maniacs.

335
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,380
 So they go from being really chilled to being super aggro,

336
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,980
 and this means that they fight other males in the vicinity,

337
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,260
 and the woman's just back there,

338
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,220
 the female's just back,

339
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,900
 and the other way we're going, "Okay, yeah.

340
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,260
 "All right, he's got some good biceps, I'll take him."

341
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:36,060
 - And yet, yet, when I go and hug the children

342
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,980
 at the local playground,

343
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,740
 and then get into a fight with another bloke just outside it,

344
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,140
 I'm off to leave the park.

345
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,140
 (laughing)

346
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,020
 - Wow.

347
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,180
 - It's a good trick.

348
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,100
 - It's amazing, that's amazing, that's so cool.

349
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,740
 - Do you know a squid have won two Nobel Prizes?

350
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,580
 - Have they?

351
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,420
 - Yep.

352
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,260
 - No, they haven't.

353
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,980
 - Yes, they have. - Someone's won a Nobel Prize,

354
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,820
 then it's been about them, the squid.

355
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,660
 - They don't play, they don't play

356
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,820
 because they are all work,

357
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,580
 and they follow that work into the Nobel Prizes.

358
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,140
 - They did all the work, really,

359
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,700
 the humans got the, you know,

360
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,780
 the humans, Andrew Huxley and a few others

361
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:08,100
 and Bernard Katz got the awards,

362
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,460
 but basically it was from cutting up squids,

363
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,540
 so I think the squids deserve a bit of credit.

364
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,380
 - Okay.

365
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,540
 - And the reason is they have massive nerve fibres

366
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,380
 in their body, right?

367
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,780
 Our nerves are really, really thin,

368
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,980
 really tiny, you can hardly see them,

369
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,060
 but in a squid, they're massive and you can see them,

370
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,140
 and originally they thought there were blood vessels

371
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,860
 that are so big, but that means that you can do loads

372
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:30,700
 of stuff to these nerve fibres,

373
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,700
 and you can learn about how they move electricity

374
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,700
 from one place to another, you know,

375
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,140
 you can see what's inside them and stuff like that,

376
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,300
 and so people studied them,

377
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,740
 and they won Nobel Prizes for it.

378
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,580
 - That's very cool.

379
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,420
 - Cool, nice.

380
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,260
 - That is cool.

381
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,060
 - I'm still giving the humans some credit for that.

382
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:45,900
 - Yeah, fair enough.

383
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,900
 - 50/50.

384
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,860
 - We need to move on to our next fact in a second.

385
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,700
 - Oh, no.

386
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:53,700
 - I read an article on something called Mel Magazine Online.

387
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,580
 I think they were a bit short on ideas,

388
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,340
 and they wanted to piggyback on Squid Game,

389
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,900
 so they asked a group of squid fishermen

390
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,660
 who are in the squid game

391
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,100
 if their job is anything like the TV show.

392
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:04,940
 - Oh, boy.

393
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,180
 (laughing)

394
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:10,260
 - One of them said that in the show,

395
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,460
 most people are looking out for themselves,

396
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:15,500
 and that's very similar to squid fishermen,

397
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,940
 because they have secrets about how to attract squid,

398
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,420
 and many of them will not share the knowledge

399
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,260
 with other people.

400
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,740
 - Well, that does happen a bit in squid game.

401
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,580
 - Exactly.

402
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,420
 - Does it?

403
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:28,620
 - I mean, it's still a bottom of the barrel commission

404
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,180
 for this magazine.

405
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,820
 - Another person said,

406
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,340
 "Squid fishing is actually really fun,

407
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,180
 "and it's a family-oriented sport,

408
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,460
 "so it's nothing like Squid Game.

409
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:41,260
 "The only asshole thing I do in squid ink

410
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,060
 "is when I'm pulling up a squid,

411
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,500
 "they tend to squirt out the ink

412
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,060
 "as they come out of the water.

413
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,500
 "So if you aim that at the person next to you,

414
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,540
 "they tend to get covered in ink."

415
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,100
 - Wow.

416
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:52,940
 - But that's really fun.

417
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,220
 They're their own little water pistols.

418
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,060
 - Yeah.

419
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:55,900
 - Cool.

420
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,860
 - Oh, I so want to know what the techniques are

421
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,940
 to lure a squid in.

422
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,980
 Like, do you put, like...

423
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,300
 - Oh, you get little kind of...

424
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,860
 The old Japanese way, what they would do is,

425
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,620
 they'd have lures that look a little like baby squids,

426
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,700
 couldn't they?

427
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,580
 - But when they squirt the ink,

428
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,460
 it produces a thing which is roughly the size and shape

429
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,620
 of a squid, and it's called a pseudomorph.

430
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,860
 So the predator is momentarily confused.

431
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,700
 What am I going for?

432
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,140
 Which of these two?

433
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,500
 - I don't know, it's very clever.

434
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,340
 - It's like leaving a hole in the wall

435
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,180
 that's the shape of you or something.

436
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,020
 - Yes.

437
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:25,860
 - As you run away.

438
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,700
 - Yeah.

439
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,380
 - Can I just say one thing about animals playing?

440
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,220
 - Yeah, sure.

441
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,700
 - There's a woman called Linda Sharp who studies

442
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,860
 lots of different types of play in animals,

443
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,460
 and says, basically, we all say we know why animals play,

444
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,340
 social bonds, preparing for adult life,

445
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,700
 but actually, we've got no idea.

446
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,020
 It's probably just 'cause it's fun.

447
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,860
 And case in point, she said, she was watching some elephants,

448
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,780
 and there was an elephant at the top of a slope,

449
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,620
 and it saw another elephant, it's a muddy slope,

450
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,260
 saw another elephant at the bottom of the slope,

451
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,180
 and it starts walking up towards this elephant

452
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,220
 at the top of the slope.

453
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,140
 And when it's halfway up, the elephant at the top

454
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:58,020
 gets on its bottom, like tucks its legs in,

455
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,700
 and sort of toboggan's down the slope,

456
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,620
 straight into the other elephant,

457
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,180
 so it takes some bows out,

458
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,020
 they roll down to the bottom of the hill,

459
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,540
 they tumble around, have this big old fight,

460
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,660
 and then eventually, she saw they've dusted themselves off,

461
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,500
 and then they were like, okay,

462
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,900
 we'll climb up the slope now.

463
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,180
 They climbed up the slope, they got halfway up,

464
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,260
 there's a third elephant at the top,

465
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,100
 you've seen it all.

466
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,420
 (laughing)

467
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,660
 - Exactly the same thing!

468
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,980
 (laughing)

469
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:23,820
 - That's amazing.

470
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,660
 - That's awesome.

471
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,340
 - We need to move on to our next fact,

472
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:30,460
 it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

473
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:35,180
 - My fact is that in 1935, New York issued a total ban

474
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:39,060
 on the possession or supply of baby artichokes.

475
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,460
 (laughing)

476
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:45,460
 This was sent to me online, actually, by @Fodsox,

477
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,260
 so thank you, Fodsox.

478
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,900
 This is a fact about the '30s war

479
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,260
 against the baby artichoke,

480
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,700
 or specifically, against the mafia

481
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,420
 through the medium of the baby artichoke, so.

482
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,140
 - It was the main war of the '30s, wasn't it?

483
00:15:59,140 --> 00:15:59,980
 The artichoke.

484
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,980
 - Yeah, it was the main war for most of the '30s,

485
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,620
 and then there was a very strong late entrant,

486
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,460
 unfortunately.

487
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,300
 (laughing)

488
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,420
 - I think in America, it was the main war

489
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,260
 for all of the '30s.

490
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,720
 - That's a very good point.

491
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,260
 - But are you giving the artichoke credit here

492
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,180
 in the way that James is giving the squid a Nobel Prize?

493
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,780
 - No, I'm not giving the artichoke any credit.

494
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,300
 I'm giving the mayor of New York,

495
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,340
 it was Fiorella LaGuardia,

496
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:22,300
 so LaGuardia Airport, named after him.

497
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,460
 He was a big deal,

498
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,420
 and in 1935, he walked into one of the biggest markets

499
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,260
 in New York City,

500
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,340
 and he announced baby artichokes, they're off the menu,

501
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,100
 and it was gonna start the day after Christmas,

502
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,740
 and he said, "I like artichokes,

503
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,620
 "particularly with Hollandaise sauce,

504
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,500
 "but the ban will remain in force

505
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,340
 "until the grip of the racketeers is broken."

506
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,540
 And basically, it was because the mafia

507
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:45,180
 controlled the baby artichoke's supply

508
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:48,020
 and made a load of money supplying New York

509
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,060
 with baby artichokes,

510
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,700
 and it was one of their major things.

511
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:55,260
 It was illegal alcohol, drugs, and then baby artichokes.

512
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,900
 - And they just forced the restaurants to buy them, didn't they,

513
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,620
 and made them really, really expensive,

514
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,900
 and cornered the market, and they're just like, yeah.

515
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,660
 - And they bought them at cheap prices, too.

516
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,380
 They squeezed the farmers at one end,

517
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,980
 and then they squeezed the restaurants at the other end.

518
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,220
 A lot of squeezing. - Very clever.

519
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,260
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

520
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,780
 - But didn't he lift the ban within a few days?

521
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,620
 - Oh, yeah.

522
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,060
 - 'Cause he was like, "Actually, I really like artichokes."

523
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,780
 - It wasn't 'cause you liked artichokes, no, they...

524
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,020
 - Whoa, he beat them off you in three days?

525
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,700
 - Yeah, because basically, there was this one guy,

526
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,260
 a mafia boss, called Ciro Terenova,

527
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,540
 and he was known as the artichoke king.

528
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,380
 - Ooh!

529
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,860
 (laughter)

530
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,460
 - Well, the only thing I know about artichokes

531
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:33,020
 is they make you fat, so I don't know.

532
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,100
 But anyway, so he was the one who was in charge of it,

533
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,860
 and when LaGuardia said, "You can't sell artichokes,"

534
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,380
 then he had no one to sell his artichokes to,

535
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,740
 and all the shops said, "Okay, we're not gonna do it.

536
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,540
 "One or two people did carry on selling them,

537
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,860
 "but they all got their licenses taken off them."

538
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,700
 - Right.

539
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,020
 - And then within three or four days,

540
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,540
 it was obvious that he wasn't gonna be able

541
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,580
 to apply his words in New York anymore.

542
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,620
 - Okay, cool.

543
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,780
 - It was a rapid turnaround.

544
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,620
 - Yeah, it was real quick.

545
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,460
 - Yeah, yeah.

546
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,740
 - Most of them were coming in from California.

547
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,020
 That's where they were all grown.

548
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,060
 And there were stories that mafia agents

549
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,180
 would go to California.

550
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,660
 They would intimidate the growers of the farmers

551
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,100
 into lowering their prices.

552
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,580
 They would even, this is reported at the time,

553
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,820
 I don't think it's true,

554
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:15,780
 threatened aerial gas bombing of the farming fields.

555
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,900
 - I saw reports in the newspapers that that happened,

556
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,180
 but again, it might not have been true.

557
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:21,020
 But the interesting thing was,

558
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,260
 because that was happening in California,

559
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,620
 and this guy was working,

560
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,700
 the artichoke king was in New York,

561
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,180
 suddenly it was in two states,

562
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,460
 which meant it was a federal case,

563
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,500
 which meant that they could get

564
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,580
 all their federal people involved,

565
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,460
 which suddenly made it a really big deal.

566
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,420
 If it was just in New York,

567
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,780
 it would have been hard for him to do anything about it.

568
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,620
 - Interesting.

569
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,540
 - Do you remember we did a fact a very long time ago

570
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,940
 about Marilyn Monroe being named artichoke queen?

571
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:44,780
 - Oh yeah.

572
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,620
 - Yeah.

573
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,700
 There was a theory that the reason she was named that

574
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,220
 was because they were trying to give a bit of sort of gloss

575
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:54,900
 back to an industry completely dominated by the mafia.

576
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,740
 - I thought you were going to say this

577
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,420
 because she was married to the artichoke king.

578
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,820
 (laughing)

579
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,660
 - Okay.

580
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,140
 - They ruled, they ruled the artichokes.

581
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:01,980
 - Yeah.

582
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,020
 - I just realized artichoke king sounds like something

583
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,100
 that a mafia boss would do to you, doesn't it?

584
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:06,940
 - Yes.

585
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:07,780
 - Oh yeah.

586
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,820
 - Subject someone to a real artichoke king.

587
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,900
 (laughing)

588
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,580
 By stuffing those weird white from things

589
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,860
 in the artichoke down your throat, that's how you do it.

590
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,500
 You'd make them eat that middle white bit.

591
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,020
 - I know, you are terrified.

592
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,820
 (laughing)

593
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,980
 - I just, I'm frightened of artichokes.

594
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,720
 - The sperm shoulder bandits tried again last night.

595
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,460
 (laughing)

596
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,180
 - And it was just baby artichokes then.

597
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,580
 It's very specific, isn't it?

598
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,420
 - Yes, only baby artichokes.

599
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,460
 - 'Cause they're quite similar.

600
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,540
 The mafia could have branched out

601
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,940
 into just the slightly bigger ones,

602
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,700
 but they didn't think of that, I guess.

603
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,540
 Not so smart.

604
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,380
 - Yeah.

605
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,180
 I think actually the only difference

606
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,900
 is that baby artichokes don't even have the chokey bit.

607
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,780
 They don't have the annoying fuzzy bit

608
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,660
 that I don't like, right?

609
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,300
 And they're not even younger.

610
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,180
 It's a real misnomer.

611
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:53,740
 They just grow lower down on the artichoke plant.

612
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,940
 So I think they're from the same plant,

613
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:55,980
 but they don't get as much sunshine,

614
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,740
 so they don't grow to be as big.

615
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,980
 And yeah, they're just more tender and nice.

616
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,180
 - Is that like how baby carrots

617
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,260
 are not really a different kind of thing?

618
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,260
 They're just.

619
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,740
 - I think they're just chopped up carrots, aren't they?

620
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,660
 - Yeah, I think they might be.

621
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,900
 But I've never been confident enough to say,

622
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,420
 "And I really regret bringing it up now."

623
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,820
 (audience laughing)

624
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,460
 - At least there's not a thousand people in York

625
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,660
 looking at you when you're saying that.

626
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,220
 - It's like an anxiety dream.

627
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,140
 - That's like Jerusalem artichokes as well.

628
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:18,980
 - Sorry?

629
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:19,820
 - Jerusalem artichokes.

630
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,660
 - Oh, yeah.

631
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,420
 - Not from Jerusalem, not artichokes.

632
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,660
 - Not even any kind of artichoke.

633
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,500
 - What the fuck is going on?

634
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,340
 - Yeah.

635
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,460
 (audience laughing)

636
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,220
 - The guy who first found them

637
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,340
 decided they tasted a bit like artichokes,

638
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,820
 so they must be artichokes, I think.

639
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,660
 - Okay.

640
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,500
 - Yeah.

641
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,380
 - Don't know where the Jerusalem bit came from.

642
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,140
 - Well, I love the Jerusalem bit.

643
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,740
 This is one of my favorite etymologies.

644
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,620
 This is because, so they look like sunflowers,

645
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,860
 Jerusalem artichokes,

646
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,860
 obviously not the gross tube a bit,

647
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,260
 but the bit that grows out of them,

648
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,660
 look like sunflowers,

649
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,860
 and Europeans discovered them in the 1600s.

650
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,460
 There was a French explorer,

651
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,580
 and brought them back, brought them back to Europe,

652
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,820
 and they got to Italy,

653
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,740
 and they were called girassole,

654
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:00,220
 as in sunflower, as turns round with the sun.

655
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,260
 So the word for sunflower in Italian,

656
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:06,580
 and girassole gradually turned into Jerusalem.

657
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,420
 - Very good.

658
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,260
 - That's cool.

659
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,100
 - Ooh.

660
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:09,920
 - I like it.

661
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,760
 - Yeah.

662
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,940
 - Do you know that the Italian word for mafia,

663
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,860
 or for a mafia clan, is cosciosca, or sosca,

664
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,460
 and that means artichoke heart?

665
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,300
 - No way, yeah.

666
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,660
 - Interesting, is it 'cause they're tightly bound together?

667
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,980
 - He's only gone and got it.

668
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,100
 - Yeah, that's exactly right.

669
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:26,940
 - They have to.

670
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,940
 - So the artichoke leaves are all really close together,

671
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,780
 and that's what the mafia clan is like.

672
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,780
 - They can't be separated.

673
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,620
 - Yeah, yeah.

674
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,460
 - Wow.

675
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,300
 - That's cool.

676
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,300
 - Very difficult to eat.

677
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,140
 - Do you know how--

678
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,540
 (laughing)

679
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,500
 - But it can be done.

680
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,860
 - Can be done.

681
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:44,220
 Do you know how we got the artichoke in the first place?

682
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,580
 - No, just grew it?

683
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,460
 - Well, it's from, no.

684
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,860
 Actually, we didn't know this.

685
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,060
 - Waitrose?

686
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,380
 - No, it's a couple of thousand years old.

687
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,060
 It dates back to ancient Greece, the artichoke.

688
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:59,380
 And it comes from a time when the Greek god, Zeus,

689
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:02,460
 fancied a woman called Kinara, or Sinara,

690
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,900
 and he installed her in heaven as his kind of mistress.

691
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,780
 But then she kept on sneaking back to the mortal plane

692
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,980
 to see her family, and Zeus found out about this,

693
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:12,660
 and he got really annoyed and turned her into an artichoke.

694
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,540
 - Ah, and that's how we have artichokes.

695
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,380
 - And that's how we have them.

696
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,220
 - Yeah. - Okay.

697
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,220
 - Well, I actually believe James' version

698
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,500
 about us just growing them.

699
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,220
 (laughing)

700
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,420
 - You choose what you wanna believe, yeah.

701
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,100
 - Just very quickly back to the mafia,

702
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:28,700
 I was very surprised to discover that they,

703
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,580
 they're just involved in so many different rackets,

704
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,420
 aren't they?

705
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:34,180
 And in 2014-ish, they started getting

706
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:37,460
 into wind farms, so they went green.

707
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,340
 - Oh, they're very ethical, always open.

708
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,100
 - Yeah, so they're known as the eco-mafia,

709
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,460
 and in Sicily, wind farms are a massive deal there now,

710
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,860
 and the money that is being generated

711
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:50,180
 from selling all of the power across Europe

712
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,780
 is such big money that that's their thing.

713
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,900
 So, yeah, it's just such a bizarre-

714
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,060
 - As far as those big blades

715
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,860
 can cut off the horse's head, it's crazy.

716
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:01,100
 (laughing)

717
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,900
 - They're also into organic food as well,

718
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,420
 the mafia at the moment, yeah, yeah, yeah.

719
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,140
 - They're such hipsters these days.

720
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,140
 (laughing)

721
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:12,140
 - Well, I say that, they're into getting cheap food

722
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,380
 from Eastern Europe, and then relabeling it as organic,

723
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,700
 and then selling it, oh.

724
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,380
 - Oh, I see, yeah.

725
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,460
 - Okay, yeah.

726
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:23,220
 - I was shocked, shocked, as someone who lives

727
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:26,340
 in East London at the level of contamination

728
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:29,100
 of what claims to be organic food by the mafia.

729
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,860
 - So, believe you me, if you think you've got

730
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:34,100
 extra virgin olive oil at home, you probably haven't.

731
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:37,060
 This is, they're adulterating all this stuff,

732
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:40,740
 and actually in Italy, the police employ special tasters

733
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,500
 who are specifically trained to spot fraudulent food

734
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,020
 to taste lots of types of olive oil.

735
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,980
 - Well, do you eat a sweet gig for the police to have?

736
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,620
 - Yeah, I know.

737
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:52,620
 They do things like, they whiten mozzarella with detergent,

738
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:55,380
 they make bread with asbestos, and--

739
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,500
 - Okay, is it getting less sweet as a gig,

740
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,820
 as you say this?

741
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,140
 - Yeah. - Wow.

742
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,820
 - But extra virgin olive oil, adulteration of that

743
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,380
 is the biggest sort of agricultural fraud in the world,

744
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:11,540
 and 60% of extra virgin olive oil that's sold is not that,

745
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,620
 is not extra virgin.

746
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,020
 - Wow, so what is it?

747
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,380
 - Just straight up shit oil.

748
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,500
 - Oh, right.

749
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,460
 - It's just adulterated with less good quality oil.

750
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,820
 It's not urine or anything, you'll be fine,

751
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,380
 you won't notice the difference,

752
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,380
 but you're being bamboozled.

753
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,100
 - Okay, that sounds fine.

754
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,900
 (laughing)

755
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,060
 - And that's the spirit which broke the mafia year in 1935.

756
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,900
 - I'm just a bit worried that we're giving the mafia

757
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,060
 a lot of shit in this podcast,

758
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,500
 and I kind of want to distance myself a tiny bit.

759
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,340
 (laughing)

760
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,180
 - Oh, wow.

761
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,940
 - You keep giving me that shit oil.

762
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:43,780
 - I'm fine.

763
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:47,300
 - My family, Mike Living, thank you.

764
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,220
 (laughing)

765
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,420
 - Bring it on, lads.

766
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:52,140
 Come on, let's be out of here.

767
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,620
 (laughing)

768
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,300
 - This is an extra virgin over here,

769
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,580
 and you're not getting any of that.

770
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,820
 (laughing)

771
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:07,140
 It is time for fact number three, and that is Anna.

772
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,420
 - My fact this week is that until recently,

773
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,540
 in the Chinese city of Chongqing,

774
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:15,020
 you could hail down a stickman to carry your bags

775
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,620
 by shouting, "Bankman!"

776
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:21,060
 Which is a fun idea, and a mysterious fact

777
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,500
 to say without explaining it.

778
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,300
 So I almost want to just leave it at that.

779
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,340
 (laughing)

780
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,580
 - What do you mean by stickman?

781
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:29,100
 It's like someone, like one of those people

782
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,380
 that tells you where the gents toilets are, or?

783
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,460
 (laughing)

784
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,300
 - That's not, they don't tell you where the toilets are.

785
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,140
 - They do.

786
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,540
 - They indicate where it is.

787
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,940
 - I think by the time you're seeing the stickman,

788
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:38,940
 you've found the toilet, James.

789
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,100
 - Yeah, I'm the one on the door.

790
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,100
 I'm over here!

791
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,460
 (laughing)

792
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,300
 Quick!

793
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,140
 (laughing)

794
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:44,980
 Free me!

795
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,140
 - There's a stole for you, quick!

796
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:47,980
 (laughing)

797
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,820
 Oh no, don't go in,

798
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,580
 there's a guy having a massive shit stand!

799
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,700
 (laughing)

800
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,380
 - It's not one of the toilet warning signs.

801
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:59,380
 It's, so these are then called, it's actually bang bang.

802
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,060
 But we discussed this,

803
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,820
 and we decided if you shouted bang bang

804
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,900
 as an ignorant English person,

805
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,500
 then they'd probably know what you meant.

806
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,940
 And it's the name for these stickmen.

807
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,980
 So they're people who carry sticks around,

808
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,220
 and they're extremely populous

809
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:16,300
 in like up until the early 2000s really in Chongqing.

810
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,780
 And they're porters.

811
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,860
 And the reason that they remained in that city

812
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,340
 is because the terrain is very hilly,

813
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,500
 it's lots and lots of winding alleyways,

814
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,620
 and lots of steps connecting one place to the other,

815
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,820
 and you can't really get a car or anything around,

816
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,620
 it's even hard to get a bike around it.

817
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,180
 And so all you can do is,

818
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,340
 you can say I've got 17 heavy suitcases,

819
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,020
 and here's a small guy with a stick.

820
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,580
 Can he carry them all please?

821
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,500
 And they do it, it's unbelievable,

822
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,780
 the loads that they carry.

823
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,460
 - There's not as many these days as though

824
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,700
 they're kind of going out, business a little bit.

825
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,780
 Yeah, there was a documentary quite recently

826
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:49,180
 called The Last Generation of Bang Bang,

827
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,660
 which was explaining that kind of these people

828
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,900
 have got other jobs now, like delivery people,

829
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,820
 like I don't know, delivery or that kind of thing.

830
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,860
 Whatever the Chinese equivalent is,

831
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,300
 that's a lot of people do that.

832
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,380
 But they were really popular,

833
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:04,420
 there was a soap opera called Mountain City Bang Bang Men,

834
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,660
 which was all about them.

835
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,500
 - Really?

836
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,860
 - And there's also a drinking game,

837
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,500
 if you're a student in Chongqing,

838
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,180
 then you might play this game.

839
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,500
 And the drinking game is basically,

840
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,900
 whenever you see one of these guys, you drink.

841
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,740
 - Oh, right.

842
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,580
 - Wow.

843
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,420
 - Wow, that was a game.

844
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,020
 - Oh no, people are so much more sober now.

845
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,540
 - Yes, they are.

846
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:23,460
 So Chongqing has, it's got a huge population,

847
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,900
 it's like 32 million at the time

848
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,020
 where they were sort of at the peak before the decline,

849
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:31,700
 there's about 30,000 stickmen that were in operation.

850
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,340
 But I was reading Chongqing, in my head,

851
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,100
 I was like, I know this place, how do I know this place?

852
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:40,420
 And it's because it has my favorite rail station,

853
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:43,660
 in so a metro station, a train station in Chongqing,

854
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:46,060
 which is, they have them very high up,

855
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:48,980
 kind of like monorails that go round through the city.

856
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:51,900
 And one particular path that it needed to take

857
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,260
 was gonna be in the exact spot

858
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,060
 where they were building a residential building,

859
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,100
 which was 19 floors high.

860
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,140
 - Oh, is that that?

861
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,580
 - Yeah, so between floors six, I believe,

862
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:03,060
 and floors nine, I think those are the right ones,

863
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,380
 they're suddenly in a residential building,

864
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,820
 a train that just goes through the building,

865
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,940
 stops in the building as well.

866
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:10,780
 - Wow.

867
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,780
 - Yeah, so it's in stop in the building,

868
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:15,400
 and they had to soundproof all of the apartments

869
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,900
 to make sure that all the noise

870
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,260
 wouldn't get to them too much.

871
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,260
 - Oh, my God.

872
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,300
 - Yeah, how cool is that, that's from Chongqing.

873
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,140
 - That's incredible.

874
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:22,980
 - Yeah.

875
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:26,260
 - I'm just sort of carrying extremely heavy weights.

876
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:28,740
 It is kind of unbelievable, so there are lots of people,

877
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,980
 particularly people who are mountain porters,

878
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,660
 so this is, you know, very high altitude environments,

879
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,100
 can carry unbelievably heavy weights.

880
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:39,180
 So they studied mountain porters in Nepal,

881
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,900
 there was a scientist from Belgium called Norman Haglund,

882
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,420
 and he was a muscle physiologist,

883
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,620
 and he thought, I've got to know what is different,

884
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,900
 like what is different physically

885
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,300
 about Nepalese mountain porters,

886
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,420
 'cause they, on average, the guys he studied

887
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:56,060
 weighed about 56 kilos, but they can carry 68 kilos.

888
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:58,180
 They can carry more than their own body weight,

889
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:01,100
 and they're carrying it uphill, steep uphill,

890
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,700
 and he studied them, and he found nothing different

891
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,420
 physically about them, except that they're just

892
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:08,220
 extremely tough, that's the only thing he found.

893
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:11,460
 They, on average, they can carry 90% of their body weight.

894
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:15,900
 The heaviest load he found was 175% of the guy's weight

895
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:16,980
 that he was carrying. - That's really cool.

896
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,100
 - And by comparison, physically fit Westerners,

897
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,860
 you know, backpacking or whatever,

898
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:24,220
 you can do about 25% of your weight for a couple of days,

899
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,180
 and then it really, really hurts,

900
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:28,340
 and these guys have just done so much of it.

901
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,540
 - Yeah, but the other thing that he said that he noticed

902
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,500
 is that they're incredibly slow.

903
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,500
 They just keep to a pace, and so, for example,

904
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,980
 if they were going to a Saturday market

905
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,540
 and they were running late,

906
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,860
 they would get up late before, you know,

907
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:44,980
 early in the morning, and they would just rather walk there

908
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:48,540
 at their super slow pace, rather than in any way be fast.

909
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,140
 - Oh, really? - They'll go through the night.

910
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,140
 - Yeah, they'll go through the night,

911
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,940
 like fast is just not an option for them.

912
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,620
 They'll just, they pace themselves.

913
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,540
 - But basically, the lesson seemed to be,

914
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,540
 we're really pathetic in the West.

915
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,940
 I mean, that was his conclusion, wasn't it?

916
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,940
 He was like, well, it turns out there's not a special gate

917
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,340
 that they have that's really great.

918
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,660
 They're not actually using oxygen much more efficiently.

919
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,820
 We can just actually carry way more than 25%.

920
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:11,180
 So next time you're off to help someone with their bags,

921
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,300
 think twice, okay?

922
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:16,820
 'Cause we should be carrying this amount as well.

923
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,980
 - There are some people in Europe who do this as well.

924
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:22,140
 So in Slovakia, in the Tattris Mountains,

925
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,700
 there are a load of hostels that are really high up,

926
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,380
 but there are no roads that get there,

927
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:28,100
 and so they have to take everything up there.

928
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,580
 So they'll take, if they need a refrigerator up there,

929
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:34,060
 they'll strap it to the back and just walk up.

930
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:36,060
 If there's a microwave, they'll strap it to the back

931
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,380
 and just walk up.

932
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:40,260
 And the record, the amount that the strongest person

933
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:43,220
 that's ever taken up to these hostels in Slovakia,

934
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:46,340
 it was going to the Lako Kalunga Castle Hotel,

935
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:51,340
 and this guy carried 207 kilograms on his back to this place.

936
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,900
 And that, if you don't know what that is,

937
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,700
 that's the equivalent to carrying a red deer,

938
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:59,060
 an upright piano, or all of Little Mix.

939
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,900
 - Wow. - Whoa!

940
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,900
 - Wow. - Jesus.

941
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,540
 - That's really put Little Mix into context for me.

942
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,860
 - We've all learned something from that comparison.

943
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:12,500
 - All of Little Mix, we're the same as one red deer.

944
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,580
 - I reckon. - Either red deer are a lot bigger

945
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,740
 than I thought, or Little Mix are a lot smaller.

946
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:19,700
 - The clue's in the name, the Little Mix, obviously.

947
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,620
 - Which Little Mix, because there were four, but now there's three.

948
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,780
 - It's the four. - The four, okay.

949
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:29,860
 - It's context. - Which sugar babes line up

950
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:32,100
 could he possibly have taken?

951
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,380
 - I was reading about porters, generally,

952
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:37,100
 and just seeing what roles they've played in history.

953
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:41,140
 And I found a really fun thing, which is in 1930,

954
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,060
 a porter carrying some luggage

955
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,740
 led to the creation of the Association

956
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:48,660
 for Mutual Help of the French Nobility.

957
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,380
 And this was two--

958
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:53,060
 - It's a bit late for them, I think, by then, isn't it?

959
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,180
 Because I've been with that 150 years earlier.

960
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,140
 - This is the thing, right?

961
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:59,300
 It's basically looking after all the noble people

962
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,460
 who fell from grace.

963
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,820
 So two people were walking along,

964
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,940
 they were having their luggage carried,

965
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:06,620
 and they suddenly noticed the person carrying the luggage

966
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,540
 was someone of noble stock.

967
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,260
 And they thought, hang on a second, what's going on?

968
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,940
 Why are you doing this menial job

969
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:17,020
 when you should be glorified in your family's right to be great?

970
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,460
 And they said, we need to give you some money.

971
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:22,060
 And they thought, what if this is happening elsewhere in France?

972
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:24,060
 And so they set up this association,

973
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:26,980
 and people can still, to this day, apply for--

974
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,740
 Yeah, please send my kid to a good school

975
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,140
 because we don't have enough money,

976
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,420
 but we're from noble background, look at our surname.

977
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,420
 - No. - And they bust a bunch of French people.

978
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,340
 You know what, if you're going to give some money to charity,

979
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:40,540
 perhaps there are a few others other than the posh friend.

980
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:45,300
 - No, absolutely not. I'm changing all my direct habits right now.

981
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:48,340
 - This is on-- they need another revolution.

982
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,820
 Did they learn nothing?

983
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,580
 - I wonder now how they noticed

984
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:55,180
 that the guy carrying the bags was of noble stock.

985
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,540
 That's the big question for me.

986
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,220
 Like, did he have a birthmark?

987
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,220
 - He was bleeding, his hands were bleeding

988
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:02,260
 because of the blisters, and I guess the blue blood,

989
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:04,500
 does that give it away, maybe?

990
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,260
 - But what was it? What do we know what it was?

991
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,260
 - They just recognised maybe it was his manner,

992
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,260
 maybe it could have been an old friend from school, I don't know.

993
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,260
 - I bet he was just like, "Do you know,

994
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:16,260
 "my great-uncle was the Baron of Orly."

995
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,260
 - Wow. - Wow.

996
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,260
 - This is about carrying heavyweights.

997
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,260
 It's not actually about humans carrying heavyweights,

998
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:25,260
 but some dung beetles, which are called onthophagous taurus,

999
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:28,260
 they can pull 1100 times their own weight,

1000
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:30,260
 which is very impressive,

1001
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:33,260
 and it's entirely evolved because of their sex life.

1002
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:37,260
 - Interesting, because I assume that all they're carrying is dung.

1003
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:40,260
 - Well, dung is big, relative to them.

1004
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,260
 - Oh, yeah, I'm not saying it.

1005
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:45,260
 - But in fact, you're right, sorry, it's not because of the dung moving.

1006
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:48,260
 So the females will dig a tunnel under a cowpat.

1007
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:51,260
 That's where they create this kind of tunnel of love

1008
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:53,260
 where they're getting ready to mate.

1009
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:56,260
 - It certainly sounds like a sexy tunnel.

1010
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:58,260
 - For the dung beetle, unbelievably sexy.

1011
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:01,260
 And basically, so the female goes into the tunnel and waits,

1012
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:04,260
 and then a male will go into the tunnel, right, to mate.

1013
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,260
 But sometimes a male will get into the tunnel

1014
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,260
 and find there's a rival male already there,

1015
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:11,260
 and they have evolved this unbelievably strong movement

1016
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:14,260
 where they fight, they tussle, and they lock horns,

1017
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:17,260
 and they try and try and try to pull each other out

1018
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,260
 or push each other out of the tunnel.

1019
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,260
 So as a result, they've evolved the ability to move

1020
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,260
 a thousand times their own weight.

1021
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:26,260
 However, there are some males which are not like that.

1022
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,260
 They're sneaky males, they're not strong,

1023
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,260
 but they are fast walkers,

1024
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,260
 and they have extremely dense testicles.

1025
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,260
 And they...

1026
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:39,260
 Fast walkers with extremely dense testicles.

1027
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,260
 What does that mean? - What does that mean?

1028
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:45,260
 Because you think that is slowing down.

1029
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:50,260
 Yeah, but it could be the momentum can pull you forward sometimes.

1030
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,260
 You know, like, when you walk,

1031
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,260
 and you kind of move your arms back and forward,

1032
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,260
 and you could swing your testicles as you walk.

1033
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,260
 Yeah, standing long jump, you preponder so forward, yeah.

1034
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,260
 Anyway, so they sneak into the tunnels, attempt a shag,

1035
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,260
 attempt to get out quickly.

1036
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,260
 So that just... The woman turns out she prefers

1037
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:07,260
 to dense testicles to the extremely strong ones.

1038
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,260
 Is that the idea? How are they winning?

1039
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,260
 It's not clear what criteria she's applying.

1040
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,260
 I think if there's a male there, she'll mate with it.

1041
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,260
 I've not got my head around the dense testicle thing.

1042
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,260
 What is that doing? Like, what is it?

1043
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:19,260
 Well, they've just got...

1044
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,260
 It just means they're producing a lot of sperm,

1045
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,260
 and they can quickly get in, mate, and get out.

1046
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:26,260
 And they're putting all of their resources into sperm quality

1047
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,260
 rather than into physical power.

1048
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:31,260
 But how do you tell someone that your sperm quality is great?

1049
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,260
 I don't think they're communicating on this level, but we're...

1050
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,260
 Right.

1051
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,260
 If there's a male there, the female will mate with it,

1052
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,260
 and he turns up and says...

1053
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,260
 It gets in there. There's no flirting, I think.

1054
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,260
 It's a bit like... You're in a tunnel under a cowpat.

1055
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,260
 I think the romance is pretty dead.

1056
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,260
 LAUGHTER

1057
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:54,260
 I was looking at other jobs that you could describe as being like porters,

1058
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:57,260
 and I was thinking one of my favourite things that I read a while back

1059
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:00,260
 is that Scottish fishermen's wives

1060
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:03,260
 were basically porters of their husbands.

1061
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,260
 So this is...

1062
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:08,260
 In the 19th century, the herring industry was massive in Scotland.

1063
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:11,260
 Everyone was a herring farmer, herring fisherman.

1064
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:15,260
 And the fishermen, when they went to get in their boats,

1065
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,260
 they would usually have sea...

1066
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,260
 They would go from a beach,

1067
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,260
 so they'd go off from a beach, get in a boat,

1068
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:24,260
 and they don't want to get wet because they're going to be out all day,

1069
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,260
 and it's fucking cold in Scotland.

1070
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:29,260
 And so the wives would always carry their husbands into the boat.

1071
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,260
 So you'll see their old photos of these husbands

1072
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,260
 with all their fishing tackle in their arms,

1073
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,260
 and their wives just carrying them like a baby

1074
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,260
 and plopping them into that little boat,

1075
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,260
 waving them off for the packed lunch.

1076
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:41,260
 That's amazing.

1077
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:46,260
 The man who has carried the heaviest load for 10 metres in history

1078
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,260
 was a guy called Patrick Bobonian,

1079
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:51,260
 and at the end of walking the 10 metres, he shouted out,

1080
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,260
 "Vegan power!"

1081
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,260
 Nice. Yeah.

1082
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:58,260
 And he was trying to prove that you can still be strong

1083
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,260
 and have a vegan diet.

1084
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,260
 They interviewed him afterwards and said,

1085
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:05,260
 "It was a bit of a stupid thing to do, and it really hurt."

1086
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:10,260
 If only I'd had a sausage sandwich before I said no.

1087
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:13,260
 Time for our final fact, and that is my fact.

1088
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:16,260
 My fact this week is that in 1994,

1089
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:21,260
 the music group, the KLF, burnt one million pounds.

1090
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:26,260
 27 years later, they're still not sure why they did it

1091
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,260
 and have even toured the UK,

1092
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:32,260
 asking audiences if they have any idea why they did it.

1093
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:38,260
 So this was a very famous moment in '90s music.

1094
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,260
 KLF were a massive band.

1095
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,260
 Justified and Ancient was a huge...

1096
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,260
 They were huge. Their singles were massive selling,

1097
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:49,260
 but they were very artistic and they were very anti the industry,

1098
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:52,260
 and they decided that they were going to absolutely

1099
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:55,260
 whiten themselves out in a way that a band has never done before.

1100
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:58,260
 They were going to take all their music away from catalogs

1101
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,260
 that were publishing it.

1102
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,260
 They were going to remove it from all shops,

1103
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,260
 and they were going to take the last amount of money

1104
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,260
 that they'd made, which was a million pounds,

1105
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:09,260
 take it out of their account and take it to an island,

1106
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:13,260
 a juror, which is in Scotland, and they went to a boat shed,

1107
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:16,260
 and they set it alight, and they burnt a million pounds.

1108
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:19,260
 And there's a lot of controversy. Did they really do it?

1109
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,260
 They claim they absolutely did.

1110
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,260
 A lot of people are very skeptical.

1111
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:26,260
 There's been a few investigations into it where the BBC have seen

1112
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,260
 that they've taken the money out from the bank,

1113
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:31,260
 and they've found little bits of burnt embers

1114
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:35,260
 that matched when little numbers that would appear on specific bills

1115
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:38,260
 kind of matched the ones that were taken from the bank.

1116
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:41,260
 But did they really do it? Is a question a lot of people have?

1117
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,260
 I think they did. James, I think you're a sceptical.

1118
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:46,260
 I think they didn't. Just on balance of probability,

1119
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,260
 I think they didn't. They might have done.

1120
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,260
 Quite often we have facts on this, and I'm like,

1121
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,260
 "That's definitely bullshit."

1122
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,260
 This one, I'm about 60/40 that it's bullshit.

1123
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:58,260
 But for instance, the little bits of burnt notes that they found,

1124
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,260
 they were found by a farmer,

1125
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:02,260
 but it turned out that the farmer's son had gone to school

1126
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:04,260
 with one of the band.

1127
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:07,260
 So it's quite a nice coincidence that they found it.

1128
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:11,260
 I read an interview with the journalist who first wrote it up.

1129
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:14,260
 He was called Michael Pilgrim, who's working for the Observer magazine,

1130
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:17,260
 and he says that he still doesn't know for sure

1131
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:19,260
 whether it was true or whether it wasn't true.

1132
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,260
 I think that was the journalist who received the story,

1133
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,260
 but he wasn't there. It was Jim Reid who was there.

1134
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,260
 Sorry, he wrote it up. Yeah, yeah.

1135
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:28,260
 So Jim Reid thought they definitely did it, I think.

1136
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:31,260
 And this guy reckons that they definitely burnt some money

1137
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:34,260
 because he has some of the money that was burnt in his house,

1138
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:37,260
 but he thinks possibly not a million pounds,

1139
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,260
 which I think is where I stand on it.

1140
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:42,260
 In 2017, they were discussing it

1141
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:44,260
 at this festival that Don was talking about,

1142
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,260
 where they asked audiences why they did it,

1143
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:49,260
 and they got an economist to describe it as quantitative tightening,

1144
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:52,260
 which is a really good phrase.

1145
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:55,260
 And there are acts who are burning money today,

1146
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:58,260
 so there's an organisation called Burn Your Money,

1147
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:01,260
 which sent some members in 2017 to the island of Jura

1148
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,260
 to burn some of their own money.

1149
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:05,260
 And they even have their own magazine, this organisation,

1150
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:07,260
 which is called Burning Issue.

1151
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:10,260
 Why are they doing that, just to imitate the grace?

1152
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,260
 Why do the initial guys do it? Yeah, exactly.

1153
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:15,260
 So initially, after they did it,

1154
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:17,260
 there was a documentary made about it,

1155
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,260
 because they had a friend called Gimpo who was with them,

1156
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,260
 who filmed it, so we do have footage of this stuff.

1157
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:23,260
 Now, what's his real name, was it?

1158
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:25,260
 I can't even remember. He's called Alan Goodrich.

1159
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,260
 Right, Alan Goodrich.

1160
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:29,260
 And so you can be sure if he's called Gimpo,

1161
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,260
 it's probably not his real name.

1162
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,260
 It could be Mark's brother, I don't know.

1163
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:36,260
 To Mr and Mrs Goodrich, a son, Gimpo.

1164
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:39,260
 So they took this video around the country,

1165
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:41,260
 and they asked these questions, you know,

1166
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,260
 "Why do you think we did it?"

1167
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,260
 Because they genuinely couldn't quite work it out,

1168
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:48,260
 but they are an artistic band, and there's a...

1169
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:52,260
 So I got this fact from a book that's called The KLF by John Higgs.

1170
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:55,260
 It is genuinely, I think, the best non-fiction book I've ever read.

1171
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,260
 Genuinely, it's my favourite non-fiction book.

1172
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:00,260
 It's magical, and it's not just about this band.

1173
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:02,260
 It's about what they encompass,

1174
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:05,260
 the worlds of the occult, the esoteric,

1175
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:07,260
 everything that was going on in pop music.

1176
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,260
 It's just... John Higgs, stunning.

1177
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:12,260
 And basically, what they decided was,

1178
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:14,260
 after they went around showing this video,

1179
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:17,260
 and not getting anywhere, but getting a lot of people furious with them,

1180
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:20,260
 that they would not talk about it for years and years and years.

1181
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:23,260
 So they signed a contract on the side of a car, a rented car,

1182
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:27,260
 pushed it off a cliff as an official contract,

1183
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:30,260
 and didn't really talk about it for 23 years.

1184
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,260
 It usually came up in conversations.

1185
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:35,260
 I bet it came up in conversations with the car rental firm.

1186
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:39,260
 That film was really interesting, because they filmed it,

1187
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:44,260
 and then they kind of destroyed the camcorder.

1188
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,260
 But then the person who filmed it, who was Gimpo, said,

1189
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:50,260
 "Oh, actually, I'd already made a copy of it, so we can have that instead."

1190
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,260
 And he turned that into a little film.

1191
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:56,260
 And they advertised that they were going to show it in Brick Lane in London,

1192
00:41:56,260 --> 00:42:00,260
 and that anyone who turned up could get free lager.

1193
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:02,260
 So lots of people turned up.

1194
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:05,260
 But too many people turned up, so they had to cancel the whole event.

1195
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:11,260
 And they were stuck with 6,237 cans of Tenant Super.

1196
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:13,260
 This was on Christmas Eve,

1197
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:16,260
 and they decided to give it to the homeless.

1198
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:24,260
 Before someone working for the charity Crisis said they were utterly irresponsible.

1199
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:30,260
 I think they were the first people to describe them as that, I suspect.

1200
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:34,260
 It sounds like the maddest experience to be on this money-burning expedition.

1201
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,260
 I wish I'd been that one journalist.

1202
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:38,260
 And they were so random in what they did.

1203
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:41,260
 They just picked this guy at Jim Reid, and called him up.

1204
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:43,260
 He doesn't know what he's getting into.

1205
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:46,260
 He's told to get in the car with these two guys, and Gimpo in the back.

1206
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:50,260
 They buy suitcases in London, two massive suitcases.

1207
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:54,260
 They go to a security firm and extract all of this cash.

1208
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:56,260
 And then disappear to Jura.

1209
00:42:56,260 --> 00:43:00,260
 And it sounds so annoying as well, because he'd be so knackered after that long, confusing day.

1210
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:02,260
 And they said, "Okay, we're going to burn all the money tomorrow."

1211
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:06,260
 And then Gimpo goes to bed, writes off his notes for the day, puts his head on the pillow,

1212
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:08,260
 and immediately they bang on his hotel door at midnight and go,

1213
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:11,260
 "Actually, we're going to do it now. Come on, we can't wait."

1214
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:12,260
 They said it was like Christmas.

1215
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:15,260
 You know, you're so excited, you can't wait till the morning.

1216
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:21,260
 And yeah, they went and they did it in this little, I think it was like a little stone kind of structure.

1217
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:26,260
 But he said, "The first thing you feel is incredibly guilty as you're watching this money disappear."

1218
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:31,260
 And then for the subsequent two or three hours, because it does take quite a long time to burn a million pounds,

1219
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:35,260
 you are just really bored for a lot of it.

1220
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:37,260
 But yeah, so surreal.

1221
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:42,260
 Well, the line that someone said about it was, it's one thing to start burning a million pounds.

1222
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:45,260
 It's another thing to finish burning a million pounds.

1223
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:50,260
 And that is something that has really made them really question everything,

1224
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:52,260
 the fact that they went for the whole thing.

1225
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:56,260
 Well, it made people so angry, because obviously they could have given that money to charity.

1226
00:43:56,260 --> 00:44:01,260
 They could have given it to, you know, members of the French aristocracy who would dance all their life.

1227
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:04,260
 They could have just kept it and pretended that they burnt it.

1228
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:06,260
 Yeah, you know.

1229
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:10,260
 Lots of people said that if you burn money by spending it on cocaine or whatever,

1230
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:14,260
 then you're forgiven much more easily than burning physical money.

1231
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:18,260
 It feels very sacrilegious.

1232
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:21,260
 But they were constantly doing stuff like this.

1233
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:24,260
 They tried to spend their money in very creative ways.

1234
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:27,260
 So after they'd had a really big hit of one or another with their big hits,

1235
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:33,260
 they tried to spend the money they got from that, getting a massive helicopter and fixing Stonehenge,

1236
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:37,260
 so that they could put it back to work again basically.

1237
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:40,260
 They could come on, let's fire up the motors.

1238
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,260
 I think also Bulldozer, they were going to bulldoze it down.

1239
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:45,260
 They bought a big bulldozer to do that.

1240
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:50,260
 And didn't they bury their Brittle wards underneath, supposedly?

1241
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:51,260
 I guess.

1242
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:54,260
 I think I was conveniently found a few weeks later by a friend.

1243
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:56,260
 You're very skeptical about this.

1244
00:44:56,260 --> 00:45:01,260
 Well, you know, it might be true, but the thing is they did have form for lots of little tricks and stuff.

1245
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:05,260
 So they made crop circles, for instance.

1246
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:11,260
 There was one time where one of the guys drove around with a massive sound equipment in his car,

1247
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:15,260
 which he claimed was powerful enough to kill livestock.

1248
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:16,260
 Right, wow.

1249
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,260
 He was going to kill a load of cars with this massive thing.

1250
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:19,260
 Wow.

1251
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:24,260
 They could kill one red deer with this sound system, or four of them.

1252
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:25,260
 You decide.

1253
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,260
 And so it's two guys, the KLF.

1254
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:32,260
 It's Drummond and Corti, and Bill Drummond, I love reading about Bill Drummond.

1255
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:33,260
 His ideas are just so wonderful.

1256
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:37,260
 One thing that he did, and I don't know if this is still going, I hope he still does it,

1257
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:41,260
 but Bill Drummond created a soup line across the British Isles.

1258
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:47,260
 And the idea was if anyone lives on Bill Drummond's soup line, you can look it up.

1259
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:51,260
 If you live and your house happens to be on the soup line, you can contact Bill Drummond,

1260
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:53,260
 and he'll come to your house and make you some soup.

1261
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:54,260
 That's...

1262
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:55,260
 No.

1263
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:58,260
 Did anyone... Did it work? Can we do that?

1264
00:45:58,260 --> 00:45:59,260
 I hope it's still going.

1265
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:01,260
 I'm not sure, but the soup line exists, and he did do that.

1266
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:05,260
 You'd have to plan it carefully so it didn't go through a major place, like Belfast.

1267
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:07,260
 No, it's incredible.

1268
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:08,260
 The soup line.

1269
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:09,260
 Wow.

1270
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:11,260
 He sounds wonderful.

1271
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:16,260
 The Guardian interviewed him in 2000, which was years and years after they burned the money,

1272
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:18,260
 and they asked him, "Have you regretted it since?"

1273
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:19,260
 He said, "No."

1274
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:21,260
 "Are you financially stable now?"

1275
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:23,260
 "No, I'm not. No."

1276
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:26,260
 And then in 2004, he said, "Of course I regretted it."

1277
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:29,260
 And so you can't work out the truth about them.

1278
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:30,260
 No.

1279
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:32,260
 They're really, really, really interesting people.

1280
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:35,260
 One thing about Drummond is he does like his lines,

1281
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:41,260
 and he believes that there's a lay line that goes from Iceland to Papua New Guinea,

1282
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:43,260
 and it goes through Liverpool,

1283
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:46,260
 and the energy of the Earth comes down from space into Reykjavik,

1284
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:49,260
 goes all the way under the Earth, and then comes out of Papua New Guinea,

1285
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:52,260
 and also comes out of a manhole cover in Liverpool.

1286
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:56,260
 And this manhole cover is just outside the cabin club,

1287
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:58,260
 and that's what he kind of thinks.

1288
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:59,260
 Yeah, Matthew Street, yeah.

1289
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:00,260
 Exactly.

1290
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:03,260
 And one time, he was the manager of Echo and the Bunnyman,

1291
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:05,260
 who a lot of you will know, a band,

1292
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:08,260
 and he got them a gig in Reykjavik, got them to play,

1293
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:13,260
 and then stood over this manhole cover to listen to see if the music came out.

1294
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:15,260
 I did not come out.

1295
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:19,260
 But part of his evidence is, you know Carl Jung, the psychoanalyst?

1296
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:20,260
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1297
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:24,260
 So Carl Jung apparently wrote once that he'd never been to Liverpool,

1298
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:26,260
 but he had a dream about Liverpool,

1299
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:31,260
 and he thought, Carl Jung said Liverpool is a pool of life it makes to live,

1300
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:34,260
 and there's a statue of Carl Jung on Matthew Street.

1301
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:37,260
 Yeah, it's a bust that sits up in a building,

1302
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:39,260
 because there was a guy called Peter O'Halligan who'd heard.

1303
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:42,260
 So this was a game-changing dream of Carl Jung's life.

1304
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:45,260
 He was like the pool of life, and then he said it's in Liverpool,

1305
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:47,260
 and Peter O'Halligan went around,

1306
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:51,260
 and he looked for descriptions that would match where Jung might have dreamed in his head,

1307
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:55,260
 and he discovered that there was this manhole sitting at the end

1308
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:58,260
 of literally 30 seconds' walk from the cavern,

1309
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:03,260
 which is why maybe the Beatles had such mystic powers and so on.

1310
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:06,260
 And presumably... Have I lost everyone?

1311
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:08,260
 Presumably Jung didn't believe any of this,

1312
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:12,260
 but thought it was a chaos against anything, or really believes it.

1313
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:15,260
 I think he might believe some of it, although we'd have to get him here,

1314
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:17,260
 we're just... I wish we could get him here.

1315
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:21,260
 On his 60th birthday, he stood for 17 hours on that manhole.

1316
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:23,260
 He didn't believe it, yeah. 17 hours.

1317
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:25,260
 Thinking about life, thinking about what he was doing.

1318
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:28,260
 Yeah, it's an important manhole.

1319
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:31,260
 I think we've mentioned before that Jeremy Corbyn also collects manhole covers.

1320
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:33,260
 He does. Well, he doesn't collect them.

1321
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:35,260
 Sorry, that makes him sound incredibly irresponsible,

1322
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:38,260
 but he is an expert on them. He knows about them.

1323
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:41,260
 He collects him trying to tug it from out from under drama.

1324
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:44,260
 You're not getting this one!

1325
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:49,260
 Just to draw us back towards the realms of the possible for a bit,

1326
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,260
 that music is really interesting,

1327
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:55,260
 because they were hugely influential in starting sampling other tracks.

1328
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:56,260
 Yes.

1329
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:58,260
 And they were one of some of the first people to do that.

1330
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:02,260
 So in 1987, they sampled a passage from "Dancing Queen" by ABBA,

1331
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:06,260
 and ABBA were not happy about it, and ABBA sued them

1332
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:10,260
 and said, "You've got to destroy all the unsolved copies of this record

1333
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:13,260
 that you've produced, all the unsolved vinyl records."

1334
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:16,260
 So then, the KLF, the two of them, they travelled to Stockholm

1335
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:20,260
 to give Agnita from ABBA a commemorative gold disc.

1336
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:24,260
 They couldn't find her, because they were just walking around in Stockholm.

1337
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:29,260
 So they gave the gold disc to a random prostitute they met in the street

1338
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:33,260
 and came home, pausing only to throw the LPs off the ferry as they went.

1339
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:35,260
 And then they burned the rest in a field.

1340
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:37,260
 They love burning things in fields, the KLF.

1341
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:40,260
 They love burning stuff, and they love throwing stuff into the sea.

1342
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:43,260
 It's true. It's their jam, and I dig it.

1343
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:47,260
 That trip to Sweden sounds very entertaining.

1344
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:52,260
 They did sit outside ABBA's record label in a police car that they'd managed to get hold of,

1345
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:57,260
 and they blasted the record that they made from which they'd stolen ABBA's music out at ABBA's record label.

1346
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:58,260
 And then they...

1347
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:00,260
 Imagine being inside the office for that. That's thrilling.

1348
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:02,260
 You know, the police are here. What do they want?

1349
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:03,260
 It's hard to tell.

1350
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:07,260
 Is this a new siren?

1351
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:09,260
 Very confusing.

1352
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:11,260
 They killed a moose accidentally.

1353
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:14,260
 They hit and killed a moose on that trip.

1354
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:17,260
 And also, they were shot at by a farmer who didn't understand

1355
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:19,260
 and we didn't like them burning shit in his field.

1356
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:21,260
 But they're never getting permission for anything.

1357
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:23,260
 So the farmer's just looking out of his window, and he's like,

1358
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:27,260
 "Oh my God, two musicians are burning huge piles of music in my crop field."

1359
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:32,260
 And so they shot their car, and they claimed they had to be towed back to England by the AA.

1360
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:35,260
 Which I didn't know the AA did call out to Gothenburg, but...

1361
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:36,260
 They're very good.

1362
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:40,260
 So Andy mentioned 2017.

1363
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:42,260
 They had a panel to talk about why they did it.

1364
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:45,260
 So there was this thing, when they pushed the car off the edge of the cliff,

1365
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:48,260
 23 years they said, "We're not going to talk about it."

1366
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:51,260
 And we will, in 23 years' time, have the answer,

1367
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:53,260
 "Why did we burn this money?"

1368
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:58,260
 So they set up this big festival where they were going to answer the question in 2017.

1369
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:01,260
 And there's an amazing hour of footage you can watch on YouTube,

1370
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:05,260
 just from one person filming the whole thing, where the KLF return.

1371
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:09,260
 And they've got a big announcement, and they arrive in an ice cream van,

1372
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:11,260
 and they've written a new book.

1373
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:15,260
 And their big announcement, outside of trying to answer why they did the money burning,

1374
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:21,260
 is that they're now no longer just musicians, but they're in the funeral business as well.

1375
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:24,260
 And what they've done is, in Toxteth, in Liverpool...

1376
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:28,260
 They'll burn you in a field, they'll throw you into the ocean.

1377
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:32,260
 They've set up this idea that you can buy, and I've seen it online,

1378
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:34,260
 and I almost bought a brick the other day.

1379
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:38,260
 You can buy a brick where you put in, if someone's passed away,

1380
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:42,260
 a milligram, I think it is, or a few milligrams of the ashes of that person,

1381
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:47,260
 and it gets baked into the brick, and they're building a ginormous pyramid in Toxteth,

1382
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:53,260
 where every year they add new bricks to it, and it's going to be something 30-something thousand bricks.

1383
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:56,260
 That happens to do it, I think. They haven't started yet, have they?

1384
00:51:56,260 --> 00:52:00,260
 How have they got planning permission from the people of Toxteth?

1385
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:02,260
 Because I imagine there'll be questions about this huge...

1386
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:05,260
 Yeah, the Toxteth Day of the Dead, it happens on November 23rd.

1387
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:07,260
 It's going to happen this year, I'm going to it.

1388
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:08,260
 Toxteth Day of the Dead?

1389
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:11,260
 Yeah, it's a big festival, they walk through the streets...

1390
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:13,260
 It's not a big festival.

1391
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:15,260
 It's not Glastonbury.

1392
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:17,260
 It's a couple of old rockers.

1393
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:19,260
 I've never heard of it, yeah.

1394
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:21,260
 No, it's new. 2017 was the first one.

1395
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:25,260
 Yeah, it's about 400 people, and they would walk through the cities of Toxteth,

1396
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:28,260
 wearing the classic Day of the Dead sort of stuff.

1397
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:32,260
 You would buy a ticket, and you didn't know what to expect, you didn't know what you would do,

1398
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:38,260
 and they would take the numbers, and if you were number one to 20 or something,

1399
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:42,260
 you would have to form a band, and then the next people would have to get a tattoo done.

1400
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:45,260
 It was like Taskmaster, really, it's pretty much like that.

1401
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:50,260
 And another group had to commandeer as many supermarket trolleys as they could,

1402
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:52,260
 and stuff like that.

1403
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:55,260
 But before they did this, before they started doing this pyramid,

1404
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:57,260
 which they will probably do,

1405
00:52:57,260 --> 00:53:01,260
 they had another idea where they wanted to build a pyramid containing the same amount of bricks

1406
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:04,260
 as there were people born in the 20th century.

1407
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:06,260
 It's quite a nice idea, isn't it?

1408
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:07,260
 How is that?

1409
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:09,260
 Well, unfortunately, it's ten billion.

1410
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:12,260
 The Great Pyramid in Giza has 2.3 million.

1411
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:14,260
 Right.

1412
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:16,260
 So it would have been a hell of a pyramid.

1413
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:19,260
 Yeah, tiny bricks, and then LEGO bricks.

1414
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:23,260
 Are they selling those bricks in it?

1415
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:25,260
 Is it a pyramid scheme?

1416
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:27,260
 That's what I'm trying to say.

1417
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:28,260
 Thank you.

1418
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:29,260
 Thank you.

1419
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:30,260
 Very nice.

1420
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:32,260
 Hey, we've got to wrap up.

1421
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:34,260
 We can't end on that.

1422
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:37,260
 That is it, that is all of our facts.

1423
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:39,260
