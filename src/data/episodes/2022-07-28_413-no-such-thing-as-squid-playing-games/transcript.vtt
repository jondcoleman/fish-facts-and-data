00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:15.020
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.780
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast,

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.040
 this week coming to you live from New York.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.780
 (crowd cheering)

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.740
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.060
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.580
 Andrew Humpton Murray, and James Harkin.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.940
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.260
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.480
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.100
 Starting with fact number one, and that is James.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.860
 - Okay, my fact this week is that actually,

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.820
 squids don't play games.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.580
 (crowd laughing)

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.540
 It's not so much a fact as a passive aggressive message

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.380
 to Netflix.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.700
 (crowd laughing)

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.740
 - Oh yeah, got their IMDB ratings

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.300
 when James Harkin gets onto it.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.420
 - I think you will find.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.660
 - Is that show anything to do with squid playing games?

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:15.900
 - No. - Have you rumbled them?

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.540
 No, right? - I haven't, no.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:18.580
 - It's just a silly thing.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.780
 Basically, I was reading about play

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.660
 and about games and the evolution of playing.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.540
 And I wanted to see what animals do play

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.660
 and what animals don't play, and for obvious reasons,

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.860
 I thought I'd see if squid play games.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.740
 And I found an article in the Journal of Current Biology

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.140
 called Fun and Play in Invertebrates by Sarah Zelinski.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.220
 And she says there is no evidence in play

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.060
 for cuttlefish or squids as defined

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.940
 by Berghardt's five criteria.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.740
 So there's like these criteria you use in biology

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.140
 to find out if someone's playing

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.660
 or if something is playing, I should say.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.360
 So it's, they do something that's not functional.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.300
 They do it voluntarily.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.540
 They do it different to the way they normally do it.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.180
 So it's slightly changed.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.500
 They repeat it and they do it when they're not under stress.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.220
 And if they do all those things, then that counts as play.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.780
 - It's interesting that not under stress

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.340
 is a criteria for play,

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.860
 because I think I was pretty stressed

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.780
 throughout the playground years.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.340
 (audience laughing)

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.660
 - You weren't playing when people were holding you down

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.500
 on the floor and--

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.620
 - I was working, avoiding being it.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.820
 And it was hard, and I lost all the time.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.020
 - And I suppose one kind of interesting thing about that

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.540
 is most invertebrates don't,

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.180
 so invertebrates things without a backbone.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.900
 Most of them don't play,

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.940
 but octopuses that are very closely related to squid,

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:31.780
 they do play.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:32.900
 So it's kind of interesting

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.700
 that those two related things do.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.340
 - And so have we, you know, had them in tanks

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.380
 and sort of like plop chestboards down

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.980
 and sort of like monopoly?

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.300
 Like have we actively tried to get them to play?

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.980
 - Monopoly.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:46.820
 - No, they don't do that,

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.340
 but they, you know, they've studied them

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.660
 many times over the years.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.260
 And with things like octopuses,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.500
 they've just noticed that they happen to do this.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.980
 So octopuses will,

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.980
 they'll kind of get like a little crab.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.140
 And when they're full,

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.260
 so they don't want to eat the crab,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.060
 they'll do it like a cat does with a mouse,

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.660
 so they'll catch it,

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.620
 and then they'll let it go

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:04.620
 and go a little bit further,

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.100
 and then they'll catch it again and stuff like that.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.380
 So that counts as playing,

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.300
 'cause it's just for fun.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.700
 It's like not exactly the same as catching a crab,

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.940
 but it's very slightly similar to catching crabs.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:14.780
 - Yeah.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.820
 - I feel like squid have a bit of a reputation

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.700
 as kind of the poor cousin of the octopus,

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.540
 'cause the octopus is so charismatic,

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.860
 it's so intelligent.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.220
 We keep being told they're as intelligent

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.420
 as a bright 12-year-old.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.620
 They could do GCSEs, all of this,

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.300
 and squid are sort of the...

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.860
 - Like a good bully Andy in the playground.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.660
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.180
 And squid are kind of the thick cousins,

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.340
 and they're just good for calamari,

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.100
 but they're brilliant.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.940
 They're really brilliant.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.980
 And there are so many varieties of squid as well.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.700
 So one of them I found out

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.780
 in the course of this squid game thing,

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.780
 Grimel de Tuthis bonplandi, okay?

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.860
 This is a particular kind of squid.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.180
 And it is a squid which uses a squid

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.060
 within a squid method of catching prey.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.740
 It is so cool.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.020
 It has these tentacles, right?

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.860
 - Yeah.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.660
 - And nice long tentacles.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.340
 And they look in low light,

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.020
 and it swims in an area of the sea with quite low light.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.460
 In low light, the ends of these tentacles

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.780
 look like baby squid, okay?

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.900
 And they leer in predators.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.700
 And it flaps them around like a baby squid,

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:16.620
 bobbing around helplessly.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:17.660
 And it leers in predators,

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.020
 the kind of predators which like to eat baby squid.

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.540
 And then, ah-ha-ha, it eats the predators

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.740
 which turn up expecting a helpless baby squid.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.060
 - That's right. - It turns out it's attached

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.660
 to this gigantic squid. - But it might be quite confusing

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.020
 if like your hand looked like your child.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.180
 Would that not be weird?

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.020
 - Yeah.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.180
 - Like you might accidentally feed it

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.620
 or put a nappy on it or something?

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:36.460
 - True.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.300
 - I think it's more like

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.300
 they're just doing finger puppet shows to each other,

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.740
 which is just really entertaining.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.460
 - But lethal finger puppet shows, you know?

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:44.300
 - Yeah, sure.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.700
 Where you eat the audience at the end.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:46.540
 That's how mine always went.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.980
 It's a good, yeah, they are great.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.860
 So there's one squid called,

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.580
 confusingly called Octopoteuthis deletron,

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.420
 but it's a squid not an octopus.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.780
 And it's, I think it's the only squid they've found so far

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.820
 that intentionally rips off its arms.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.660
 And it does it to defend or attack.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:03.500
 And this--

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.340
 - What?

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.180
 How?

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.700
 - So attack, does he rip off an arm

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:07.900
 and hit someone with it?

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.860
 - I think it's more like distraction.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.180
 - Rather than-- - That would be distracting.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.700
 - If you're in the middle of a boxing fight

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.020
 with Chris Eubank Jr. and he pulls his arm off,

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.860
 you'd be like, what?

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.780
 Yeah, and then he could clock you in the head

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.460
 with the other arm still attached.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.740
 But it's gonna be his last fight.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.820
 So, yeah, this woman was studying them

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.940
 and a quarter of these squid have at least one blunt arm.

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.940
 A lot of, as in an arm, which was missing a bit.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.020
 And they can ditch them at any kind of joint.

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.380
 They can ditch them at various bits up the arm.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.460
 So you only need to drop the bit that's being threatened.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:39.300
 And it's so cool.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.100
 This researcher was called Stephanie Bush.

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.740
 And she collected a bunch of squid

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.780
 to put in tanks in her lab.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.100
 And loads of them immediately shed their arms at her

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.940
 trying to get away.

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.660
 And she said there was one of them,

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.220
 which was when in the lab,

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.940
 it grasped the bottom of the container

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:54.900
 with its arm hooks.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.260
 They've got little hooks on their arms.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.140
 It somersaulted repeatedly and released ink

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.060
 as it detached part of all eight of its arms.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.380
 - Whoa! - And as they released the arms,

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.420
 they flashed 'cause, you know,

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:06.940
 they can emit their own light squids.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:08.620
 So all the arms got released

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.620
 and then flashed lightning bolts through the water.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.140
 - That is amazing. - This is horrifying.

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:16.300
 - They're also one of the few squid that has a penis.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.740
 - Yeah. - The octopotuthis diletron,

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:19.860
 was it? - Yes.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.340
 - So yeah, they have a penis

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.060
 and they have sex by depositing sperm

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.020
 on the body of the females, the males do.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.140
 Although I say females,

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:30.620
 actually they're pretty indiscriminate

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.140
 because they live where it's quite dark

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.380
 and researchers have looked at all the different squids

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.340
 that have squid semen on them.

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.660
 And it's pretty much 50/50 male and female.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.500
 - Right. - They'll just,

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.620
 if they see a squid, they'll go for it.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.860
 - Oh, cool. - They're desperate.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.620
 - Yeah, that's amazing.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.300
 - A lot of these squid go their whole lives

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.180
 without meeting another squid.

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.820
 - Really? - This is why they're so desperate, yeah.

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.580
 So when they see one, you can't blame them.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.380
 - Right, oh god. - It's kind of sad.

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.780
 - Have, you know, have a chat first or, you know,

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.980
 some, a drink and just go straight in for the shag.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.060
 - Yeah, fair.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.300
 - I was looking up squid games

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.860
 and I actually found something the opposite

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:08.700
 to what we're talking about,

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:12.740
 which is humans trying to get squids in competition.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.460
 So there's an all-England squid championship that takes place.

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.380
 - That's amazing. - That's an annual championship.

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:23.380
 So what this is, is there's 74 competitors that go out

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:25.980
 and they spend five hours hoping to catch

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.300
 over 100 squids during the course of the day.

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:29.420
 - Five hours. - And then, yeah,

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.740
 they find the longest one.

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:35.740
 In 2012, it was won by a guy called David,

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.420
 who was a reigning champion.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:38.740
 He'd won the previous year.

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:41.940
 But in 2012, there was terrible weather conditions

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:43.580
 and it was really, really rainy

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:46.220
 and no one was catching any squids.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.860
 And he happened to notice, just before he was sending

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:52.900
 his reel back out, that right on the tip of his little hook

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.100
 was a tiny squid, a third of an inch long,

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.420
 and it was the only squid caught that year.

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:03.140
 So the 2012 winner of the all-England squid championship

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:04.980
 was a third of an inch long. - You know what,

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:07.660
 I want to watch that documentary

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.180
 and put it on Netflix called Squid Game 2.

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:13.860
 - No one must have believed that squid

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.100
 when it got back to its friends

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:18.460
 and said, "Guys, I just won Squid of the year."

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:19.780
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:22.380
 - He would have got Seaman all over him

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:25.100
 from every rich way with me.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.020
 - Well, while we're on that.

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:29.700
 - Well, good.

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:31.460
 And we were obviously going to be at some point.

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:32.420
 - At some point, at some point.

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:33.260
 Let's get there now.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.420
 - The northern pygmy squid, did you hear about this?

00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:36.260
 - Oh, yeah.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:37.940
 - So this is a squid where the female

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:40.140
 fertilizes her own eggs, okay?

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:41.220
 It's bizarre.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:45.580
 So, as James said, the male kind of attaches the sperm

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:46.940
 to the body of the female.

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:49.260
 So it's not a kind of mating as we would understand it,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:50.100
 but the sperm--

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.020
 - Yeah, so you would understand it maybe.

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.460
 (audience laughing)

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.500
 I like my sperm to spot it on my shoulder.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.980
 And you know, I can dip in whenever I like.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:08:59.820
 - Well.

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.540
 (audience laughing)

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:03.380
 - I don't know.

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:04.220
 Female choice.

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:06.540
 (audience laughing)

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:09.420
 - I'm just going to cut that out, by the way.

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:12.140
 And when Dan goes, "Fact number two, Anna Tyshinski,"

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:13.900
 it'll just be like, "My fact is,

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:15.900
 I like Seaman on the back of my shoulder."

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:19.540
 (audience laughing)

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:20.620
 - It's just less effort.

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:21.460
 Sorry, Andy.

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:22.300
 - No, no, no, no.

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:23.820
 (audience laughing)

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.220
 - Well, you would fit in like a charm

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:28.060
 into the northern pygmy squid society, Anna,

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:30.380
 because the male attaches the sperm to the female,

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:31.940
 and then it goes through.

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:33.980
 It sort of gets into her body somehow.

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:35.340
 I'm not exactly clear on the mechanism,

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:38.420
 but it gets into the female's mouth

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:40.300
 when she's ready to inseminate.

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:43.820
 And then she bites a hole in each of her eggs

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:47.140
 and just deposits a bit, squirts a bit of sperm,

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:49.140
 into each of the eggs to fertilize the eggs.

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:49.980
 - Oh, wow.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.100
 - So she is doing the fertilizing at that point.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:52.940
 Bizarre.

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:53.780
 - That's very cool.

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:57.940
 That's like in Vecho, or it's like a test tube baby.

00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:59.460
 - Kind of, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:00.300
 - Those guys are pretty cool.

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.260
 They have like a sticky patch on their back.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
 And when they're kind of swimming around,

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:05.100
 if they get tired,

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.260
 they can just stick themselves to a bit of seaweed.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:09.100
 - Wow. - And they just watch

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:10.100
 things go past.

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:11.740
 - That's great. - And then unstick themselves

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:12.780
 and then swim around again.

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:14.100
 - That's so cool, so fun.

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.620
 - And we say they don't play.

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:16.460
 Come on.

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:17.300
 - Yeah.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.020
 - Did you guys ever do a fly wall when you were kids,

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:21.500
 where you would do a somersault against a Velcro wall?

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:22.460
 That's just like that.

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:24.540
 - No, well, we didn't have a Velcro wall in our house,

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:25.380
 sadly.

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:26.220
 (audience laughing)

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:28.580
 - What wall did you keep your Velcro wall in?

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:30.540
 - It was next to the bouncy castle drawing room.

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:33.540
 (audience laughing)

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:36.620
 So on actually how they reproduce,

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:37.780
 there's this really interesting thing

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:38.820
 that they've recently discovered,

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:40.940
 which is it's about the egg mops.

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:41.980
 So I quite like this,

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:44.420
 that when the female deposits all her fertilized eggs,

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:45.420
 they're called mops,

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.100
 and they're in these big piles,

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.980
 and she sticks them to the ground.

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:52.300
 And then male squid are attracted to these.

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:53.500
 And that doesn't really make any sense,

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:54.740
 because they've already been fertilized,

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:56.060
 so they're no use to the males.

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:58.260
 But what it means is there are fertile females

00:10:58.260 --> 00:10:59.380
 in the vicinity,

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:01.220
 'cause they tend to kind of hang out together.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:02.060
 And not only this,

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:03.540
 the male squid are attracted to the egg mops,

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:05.260
 and then they come up to the egg mops,

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:06.740
 and they kind of hug them,

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:08.980
 very weird, and sort of stroke the eggs.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:10.860
 And we didn't really know why they were doing this,

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.980
 but it turns out that there's a chemical on the eggs,

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:15.260
 and as soon as the male squid sort of stroke

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:16.280
 and hug the eggs,

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:18.220
 they get this chemical on their arms,

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:21.740
 and it turns them into like raging maniacs.

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:24.380
 So they go from being really chilled to being super aggro,

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.980
 and this means that they fight other males in the vicinity,

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:28.260
 and the woman's just back there,

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:29.220
 the female's just back,

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:30.900
 and the other way we're going, "Okay, yeah.

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.260
 "All right, he's got some good biceps, I'll take him."

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.060
 - And yet, yet, when I go and hug the children

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:37.980
 at the local playground,

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.740
 and then get into a fight with another bloke just outside it,

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.140
 I'm off to leave the park.

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:43.140
 (laughing)

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:44.020
 - Wow.

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:45.180
 - It's a good trick.

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:47.100
 - It's amazing, that's amazing, that's so cool.

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:49.740
 - Do you know a squid have won two Nobel Prizes?

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:50.580
 - Have they?

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:51.420
 - Yep.

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:52.260
 - No, they haven't.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:53.980
 - Yes, they have. - Someone's won a Nobel Prize,

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.820
 then it's been about them, the squid.

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:56.660
 - They don't play, they don't play

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:57.820
 because they are all work,

00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:00.580
 and they follow that work into the Nobel Prizes.

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.140
 - They did all the work, really,

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:03.700
 the humans got the, you know,

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.780
 the humans, Andrew Huxley and a few others

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:08.100
 and Bernard Katz got the awards,

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:10.460
 but basically it was from cutting up squids,

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:12.540
 so I think the squids deserve a bit of credit.

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:13.380
 - Okay.

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:15.540
 - And the reason is they have massive nerve fibres

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:16.380
 in their body, right?

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:17.780
 Our nerves are really, really thin,

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:19.980
 really tiny, you can hardly see them,

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:23.060
 but in a squid, they're massive and you can see them,

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:25.140
 and originally they thought there were blood vessels

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:27.860
 that are so big, but that means that you can do loads

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:30.700
 of stuff to these nerve fibres,

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:33.700
 and you can learn about how they move electricity

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:35.700
 from one place to another, you know,

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:38.140
 you can see what's inside them and stuff like that,

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:39.300
 and so people studied them,

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:40.740
 and they won Nobel Prizes for it.

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:41.580
 - That's very cool.

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:42.420
 - Cool, nice.

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:43.260
 - That is cool.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.060
 - I'm still giving the humans some credit for that.

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:45.900
 - Yeah, fair enough.

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:46.900
 - 50/50.

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:48.860
 - We need to move on to our next fact in a second.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:49.700
 - Oh, no.

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:53.700
 - I read an article on something called Mel Magazine Online.

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.580
 I think they were a bit short on ideas,

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:57.340
 and they wanted to piggyback on Squid Game,

00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:59.900
 so they asked a group of squid fishermen

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:01.660
 who are in the squid game

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:04.100
 if their job is anything like the TV show.

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:04.940
 - Oh, boy.

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:07.180
 (laughing)

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:10.260
 - One of them said that in the show,

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.460
 most people are looking out for themselves,

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:15.500
 and that's very similar to squid fishermen,

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:18.940
 because they have secrets about how to attract squid,

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.420
 and many of them will not share the knowledge

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:22.260
 with other people.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:23.740
 - Well, that does happen a bit in squid game.

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:24.580
 - Exactly.

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:25.420
 - Does it?

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:28.620
 - I mean, it's still a bottom of the barrel commission

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:30.180
 for this magazine.

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:31.820
 - Another person said,

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:34.340
 "Squid fishing is actually really fun,

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:36.180
 "and it's a family-oriented sport,

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:38.460
 "so it's nothing like Squid Game.

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:41.260
 "The only asshole thing I do in squid ink

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.060
 "is when I'm pulling up a squid,

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:44.500
 "they tend to squirt out the ink

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.060
 "as they come out of the water.

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:48.500
 "So if you aim that at the person next to you,

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.540
 "they tend to get covered in ink."

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:52.100
 - Wow.

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:52.940
 - But that's really fun.

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:54.220
 They're their own little water pistols.

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:55.060
 - Yeah.

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:55.900
 - Cool.

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:57.860
 - Oh, I so want to know what the techniques are

00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:59.940
 to lure a squid in.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:00.980
 Like, do you put, like...

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:03.300
 - Oh, you get little kind of...

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:04.860
 The old Japanese way, what they would do is,

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:07.620
 they'd have lures that look a little like baby squids,

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:08.700
 couldn't they?

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:10.580
 - But when they squirt the ink,

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:13.460
 it produces a thing which is roughly the size and shape

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:16.620
 of a squid, and it's called a pseudomorph.

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:18.860
 So the predator is momentarily confused.

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:19.700
 What am I going for?

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:21.140
 Which of these two?

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:22.500
 - I don't know, it's very clever.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:23.340
 - It's like leaving a hole in the wall

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:24.180
 that's the shape of you or something.

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:25.020
 - Yes.

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:25.860
 - As you run away.

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:26.700
 - Yeah.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.380
 - Can I just say one thing about animals playing?

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:29.220
 - Yeah, sure.

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:31.700
 - There's a woman called Linda Sharp who studies

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:33.860
 lots of different types of play in animals,

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:36.460
 and says, basically, we all say we know why animals play,

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:38.340
 social bonds, preparing for adult life,

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:39.700
 but actually, we've got no idea.

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:41.020
 It's probably just 'cause it's fun.

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:43.860
 And case in point, she said, she was watching some elephants,

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.780
 and there was an elephant at the top of a slope,

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:48.620
 and it saw another elephant, it's a muddy slope,

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:50.260
 saw another elephant at the bottom of the slope,

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.180
 and it starts walking up towards this elephant

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:53.220
 at the top of the slope.

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:55.140
 And when it's halfway up, the elephant at the top

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:58.020
 gets on its bottom, like tucks its legs in,

00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:00.700
 and sort of toboggan's down the slope,

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:02.620
 straight into the other elephant,

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:04.180
 so it takes some bows out,

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:06.020
 they roll down to the bottom of the hill,

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:08.540
 they tumble around, have this big old fight,

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:11.660
 and then eventually, she saw they've dusted themselves off,

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:12.500
 and then they were like, okay,

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:13.900
 we'll climb up the slope now.

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.180
 They climbed up the slope, they got halfway up,

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:17.260
 there's a third elephant at the top,

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:18.100
 you've seen it all.

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:19.420
 (laughing)

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:20.660
 - Exactly the same thing!

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:22.980
 (laughing)

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:23.820
 - That's amazing.

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:24.660
 - That's awesome.

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:26.340
 - We need to move on to our next fact,

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:30.460
 it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:35.180
 - My fact is that in 1935, New York issued a total ban

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:39.060
 on the possession or supply of baby artichokes.

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:40.460
 (laughing)

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:45.460
 This was sent to me online, actually, by @Fodsox,

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:47.260
 so thank you, Fodsox.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.900
 This is a fact about the '30s war

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:52.260
 against the baby artichoke,

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.700
 or specifically, against the mafia

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:57.420
 through the medium of the baby artichoke, so.

00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:59.140
 - It was the main war of the '30s, wasn't it?

00:15:59.140 --> 00:15:59.980
 The artichoke.

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:01.980
 - Yeah, it was the main war for most of the '30s,

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:03.620
 and then there was a very strong late entrant,

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:04.460
 unfortunately.

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:05.300
 (laughing)

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:06.420
 - I think in America, it was the main war

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:07.260
 for all of the '30s.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:08.720
 - That's a very good point.

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.260
 - But are you giving the artichoke credit here

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.180
 in the way that James is giving the squid a Nobel Prize?

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:14.780
 - No, I'm not giving the artichoke any credit.

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:16.300
 I'm giving the mayor of New York,

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:19.340
 it was Fiorella LaGuardia,

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:22.300
 so LaGuardia Airport, named after him.

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:23.460
 He was a big deal,

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:26.420
 and in 1935, he walked into one of the biggest markets

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:27.260
 in New York City,

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.340
 and he announced baby artichokes, they're off the menu,

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:32.100
 and it was gonna start the day after Christmas,

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:33.740
 and he said, "I like artichokes,

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:35.620
 "particularly with Hollandaise sauce,

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.500
 "but the ban will remain in force

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:40.340
 "until the grip of the racketeers is broken."

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:42.540
 And basically, it was because the mafia

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.180
 controlled the baby artichoke's supply

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:48.020
 and made a load of money supplying New York

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:49.060
 with baby artichokes,

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:51.700
 and it was one of their major things.

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:55.260
 It was illegal alcohol, drugs, and then baby artichokes.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.900
 - And they just forced the restaurants to buy them, didn't they,

00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:59.620
 and made them really, really expensive,

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:01.900
 and cornered the market, and they're just like, yeah.

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:03.660
 - And they bought them at cheap prices, too.

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:05.380
 They squeezed the farmers at one end,

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:06.980
 and then they squeezed the restaurants at the other end.

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:08.220
 A lot of squeezing. - Very clever.

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:09.260
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.780
 - But didn't he lift the ban within a few days?

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:12.620
 - Oh, yeah.

00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:14.060
 - 'Cause he was like, "Actually, I really like artichokes."

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:15.780
 - It wasn't 'cause you liked artichokes, no, they...

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:18.020
 - Whoa, he beat them off you in three days?

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:20.700
 - Yeah, because basically, there was this one guy,

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:23.260
 a mafia boss, called Ciro Terenova,

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.540
 and he was known as the artichoke king.

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:27.380
 - Ooh!

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:28.860
 (laughter)

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:30.460
 - Well, the only thing I know about artichokes

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:33.020
 is they make you fat, so I don't know.

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:35.100
 But anyway, so he was the one who was in charge of it,

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:38.860
 and when LaGuardia said, "You can't sell artichokes,"

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:41.380
 then he had no one to sell his artichokes to,

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:43.740
 and all the shops said, "Okay, we're not gonna do it.

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:45.540
 "One or two people did carry on selling them,

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:47.860
 "but they all got their licenses taken off them."

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:48.700
 - Right.

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:50.020
 - And then within three or four days,

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:51.540
 it was obvious that he wasn't gonna be able

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:53.580
 to apply his words in New York anymore.

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:54.620
 - Okay, cool.

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:56.780
 - It was a rapid turnaround.

00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:57.620
 - Yeah, it was real quick.

00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:58.460
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:17:58.460 --> 00:17:59.740
 - Most of them were coming in from California.

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:01.020
 That's where they were all grown.

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:03.060
 And there were stories that mafia agents

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:04.180
 would go to California.

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:06.660
 They would intimidate the growers of the farmers

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:08.100
 into lowering their prices.

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:10.580
 They would even, this is reported at the time,

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:11.820
 I don't think it's true,

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:15.780
 threatened aerial gas bombing of the farming fields.

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:17.900
 - I saw reports in the newspapers that that happened,

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:19.180
 but again, it might not have been true.

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:21.020
 But the interesting thing was,

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:23.260
 because that was happening in California,

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:24.620
 and this guy was working,

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:26.700
 the artichoke king was in New York,

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:28.180
 suddenly it was in two states,

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:30.460
 which meant it was a federal case,

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:31.500
 which meant that they could get

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.580
 all their federal people involved,

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:35.460
 which suddenly made it a really big deal.

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:36.420
 If it was just in New York,

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:38.780
 it would have been hard for him to do anything about it.

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:39.620
 - Interesting.

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:41.540
 - Do you remember we did a fact a very long time ago

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:43.940
 about Marilyn Monroe being named artichoke queen?

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:44.780
 - Oh yeah.

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:45.620
 - Yeah.

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:47.700
 There was a theory that the reason she was named that

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:51.220
 was because they were trying to give a bit of sort of gloss

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:54.900
 back to an industry completely dominated by the mafia.

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:55.740
 - I thought you were going to say this

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.420
 because she was married to the artichoke king.

00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:58.820
 (laughing)

00:18:58.820 --> 00:18:59.660
 - Okay.

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:01.140
 - They ruled, they ruled the artichokes.

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:01.980
 - Yeah.

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:04.020
 - I just realized artichoke king sounds like something

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:06.100
 that a mafia boss would do to you, doesn't it?

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:06.940
 - Yes.

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:07.780
 - Oh yeah.

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:09.820
 - Subject someone to a real artichoke king.

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:10.900
 (laughing)

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.580
 By stuffing those weird white from things

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:15.860
 in the artichoke down your throat, that's how you do it.

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:17.500
 You'd make them eat that middle white bit.

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.020
 - I know, you are terrified.

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:20.820
 (laughing)

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:22.980
 - I just, I'm frightened of artichokes.

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:25.720
 - The sperm shoulder bandits tried again last night.

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:28.460
 (laughing)

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:30.180
 - And it was just baby artichokes then.

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:31.580
 It's very specific, isn't it?

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:32.420
 - Yes, only baby artichokes.

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:33.460
 - 'Cause they're quite similar.

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:34.540
 The mafia could have branched out

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:35.940
 into just the slightly bigger ones,

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:37.700
 but they didn't think of that, I guess.

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:38.540
 Not so smart.

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:39.380
 - Yeah.

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:41.180
 I think actually the only difference

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:43.900
 is that baby artichokes don't even have the chokey bit.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:45.780
 They don't have the annoying fuzzy bit

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:47.660
 that I don't like, right?

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:49.300
 And they're not even younger.

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:50.180
 It's a real misnomer.

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:53.740
 They just grow lower down on the artichoke plant.

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:54.940
 So I think they're from the same plant,

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:55.980
 but they don't get as much sunshine,

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:57.740
 so they don't grow to be as big.

00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:59.980
 And yeah, they're just more tender and nice.

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:01.180
 - Is that like how baby carrots

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:03.260
 are not really a different kind of thing?

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:04.260
 They're just.

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:05.740
 - I think they're just chopped up carrots, aren't they?

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:06.660
 - Yeah, I think they might be.

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:08.900
 But I've never been confident enough to say,

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:10.420
 "And I really regret bringing it up now."

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:11.820
 (audience laughing)

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:13.460
 - At least there's not a thousand people in York

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:14.660
 looking at you when you're saying that.

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:16.220
 - It's like an anxiety dream.

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:18.140
 - That's like Jerusalem artichokes as well.

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:18.980
 - Sorry?

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:19.820
 - Jerusalem artichokes.

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:20.660
 - Oh, yeah.

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:22.420
 - Not from Jerusalem, not artichokes.

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:23.660
 - Not even any kind of artichoke.

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:24.500
 - What the fuck is going on?

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:25.340
 - Yeah.

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:26.460
 (audience laughing)

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:28.220
 - The guy who first found them

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:30.340
 decided they tasted a bit like artichokes,

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:31.820
 so they must be artichokes, I think.

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:32.660
 - Okay.

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:33.500
 - Yeah.

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.380
 - Don't know where the Jerusalem bit came from.

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:37.140
 - Well, I love the Jerusalem bit.

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:38.740
 This is one of my favorite etymologies.

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:40.620
 This is because, so they look like sunflowers,

00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:41.860
 Jerusalem artichokes,

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:43.860
 obviously not the gross tube a bit,

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:45.260
 but the bit that grows out of them,

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:46.660
 look like sunflowers,

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:49.860
 and Europeans discovered them in the 1600s.

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:51.460
 There was a French explorer,

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:53.580
 and brought them back, brought them back to Europe,

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:54.820
 and they got to Italy,

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:56.740
 and they were called girassole,

00:20:56.740 --> 00:21:00.220
 as in sunflower, as turns round with the sun.

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:02.260
 So the word for sunflower in Italian,

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:06.580
 and girassole gradually turned into Jerusalem.

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:07.420
 - Very good.

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:08.260
 - That's cool.

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:09.100
 - Ooh.

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:09.920
 - I like it.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:10.760
 - Yeah.

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:12.940
 - Do you know that the Italian word for mafia,

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:16.860
 or for a mafia clan, is cosciosca, or sosca,

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.460
 and that means artichoke heart?

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:20.300
 - No way, yeah.

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:23.660
 - Interesting, is it 'cause they're tightly bound together?

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:24.980
 - He's only gone and got it.

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:26.100
 - Yeah, that's exactly right.

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:26.940
 - They have to.

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:28.940
 - So the artichoke leaves are all really close together,

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:30.780
 and that's what the mafia clan is like.

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:31.780
 - They can't be separated.

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:32.620
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:33.460
 - Wow.

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:34.300
 - That's cool.

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:35.300
 - Very difficult to eat.

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:36.140
 - Do you know how--

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:38.540
 (laughing)

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:40.500
 - But it can be done.

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:41.860
 - Can be done.

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:44.220
 Do you know how we got the artichoke in the first place?

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:45.580
 - No, just grew it?

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:47.460
 - Well, it's from, no.

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:48.860
 Actually, we didn't know this.

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:50.060
 - Waitrose?

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:52.380
 - No, it's a couple of thousand years old.

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:55.060
 It dates back to ancient Greece, the artichoke.

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:59.380
 And it comes from a time when the Greek god, Zeus,

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:02.460
 fancied a woman called Kinara, or Sinara,

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:04.900
 and he installed her in heaven as his kind of mistress.

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:07.780
 But then she kept on sneaking back to the mortal plane

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:09.980
 to see her family, and Zeus found out about this,

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:12.660
 and he got really annoyed and turned her into an artichoke.

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:14.540
 - Ah, and that's how we have artichokes.

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:15.380
 - And that's how we have them.

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:16.220
 - Yeah. - Okay.

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:18.220
 - Well, I actually believe James' version

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:19.500
 about us just growing them.

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:21.220
 (laughing)

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:23.420
 - You choose what you wanna believe, yeah.

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:25.100
 - Just very quickly back to the mafia,

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:28.700
 I was very surprised to discover that they,

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:30.580
 they're just involved in so many different rackets,

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:31.420
 aren't they?

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:34.180
 And in 2014-ish, they started getting

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:37.460
 into wind farms, so they went green.

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:39.340
 - Oh, they're very ethical, always open.

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:42.100
 - Yeah, so they're known as the eco-mafia,

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:45.460
 and in Sicily, wind farms are a massive deal there now,

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:46.860
 and the money that is being generated

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:50.180
 from selling all of the power across Europe

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:52.780
 is such big money that that's their thing.

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:54.900
 So, yeah, it's just such a bizarre-

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:56.060
 - As far as those big blades

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:57.860
 can cut off the horse's head, it's crazy.

00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:01.100
 (laughing)

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:03.900
 - They're also into organic food as well,

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:05.420
 the mafia at the moment, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:07.140
 - They're such hipsters these days.

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:08.140
 (laughing)

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:12.140
 - Well, I say that, they're into getting cheap food

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:15.380
 from Eastern Europe, and then relabeling it as organic,

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:16.700
 and then selling it, oh.

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:18.380
 - Oh, I see, yeah.

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:19.460
 - Okay, yeah.

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:23.220
 - I was shocked, shocked, as someone who lives

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:26.340
 in East London at the level of contamination

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:29.100
 of what claims to be organic food by the mafia.

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:30.860
 - So, believe you me, if you think you've got

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:34.100
 extra virgin olive oil at home, you probably haven't.

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:37.060
 This is, they're adulterating all this stuff,

00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:40.740
 and actually in Italy, the police employ special tasters

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:43.500
 who are specifically trained to spot fraudulent food

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.020
 to taste lots of types of olive oil.

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:47.980
 - Well, do you eat a sweet gig for the police to have?

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:49.620
 - Yeah, I know.

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:52.620
 They do things like, they whiten mozzarella with detergent,

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:55.380
 they make bread with asbestos, and--

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:58.500
 - Okay, is it getting less sweet as a gig,

00:23:58.500 --> 00:23:59.820
 as you say this?

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:01.140
 - Yeah. - Wow.

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:04.820
 - But extra virgin olive oil, adulteration of that

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:07.380
 is the biggest sort of agricultural fraud in the world,

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:11.540
 and 60% of extra virgin olive oil that's sold is not that,

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:12.620
 is not extra virgin.

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:14.020
 - Wow, so what is it?

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.380
 - Just straight up shit oil.

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:17.500
 - Oh, right.

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:20.460
 - It's just adulterated with less good quality oil.

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:22.820
 It's not urine or anything, you'll be fine,

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:24.380
 you won't notice the difference,

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:27.380
 but you're being bamboozled.

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:29.100
 - Okay, that sounds fine.

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:30.900
 (laughing)

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:34.060
 - And that's the spirit which broke the mafia year in 1935.

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:35.900
 - I'm just a bit worried that we're giving the mafia

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:37.060
 a lot of shit in this podcast,

00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:39.500
 and I kind of want to distance myself a tiny bit.

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:40.340
 (laughing)

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:41.180
 - Oh, wow.

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:42.940
 - You keep giving me that shit oil.

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:43.780
 - I'm fine.

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:47.300
 - My family, Mike Living, thank you.

00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:48.220
 (laughing)

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:49.420
 - Bring it on, lads.

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:52.140
 Come on, let's be out of here.

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:54.620
 (laughing)

00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:56.300
 - This is an extra virgin over here,

00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:58.580
 and you're not getting any of that.

00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:00.820
 (laughing)

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:07.140
 It is time for fact number three, and that is Anna.

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:09.420
 - My fact this week is that until recently,

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:11.540
 in the Chinese city of Chongqing,

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:15.020
 you could hail down a stickman to carry your bags

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:17.620
 by shouting, "Bankman!"

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:21.060
 Which is a fun idea, and a mysterious fact

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:22.500
 to say without explaining it.

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:24.300
 So I almost want to just leave it at that.

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:25.340
 (laughing)

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:26.580
 - What do you mean by stickman?

00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:29.100
 It's like someone, like one of those people

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:31.380
 that tells you where the gents toilets are, or?

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:32.460
 (laughing)

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:34.300
 - That's not, they don't tell you where the toilets are.

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:35.140
 - They do.

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:36.540
 - They indicate where it is.

00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:37.940
 - I think by the time you're seeing the stickman,

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:38.940
 you've found the toilet, James.

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:40.100
 - Yeah, I'm the one on the door.

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:41.100
 I'm over here!

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:42.460
 (laughing)

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:43.300
 Quick!

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:44.140
 (laughing)

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:44.980
 Free me!

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:47.140
 - There's a stole for you, quick!

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:47.980
 (laughing)

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:48.820
 Oh no, don't go in,

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:50.580
 there's a guy having a massive shit stand!

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:51.700
 (laughing)

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:54.380
 - It's not one of the toilet warning signs.

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:59.380
 It's, so these are then called, it's actually bang bang.

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:01.060
 But we discussed this,

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:02.820
 and we decided if you shouted bang bang

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:04.900
 as an ignorant English person,

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:06.500
 then they'd probably know what you meant.

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:08.940
 And it's the name for these stickmen.

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:10.980
 So they're people who carry sticks around,

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:13.220
 and they're extremely populous

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:16.300
 in like up until the early 2000s really in Chongqing.

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:17.780
 And they're porters.

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:19.860
 And the reason that they remained in that city

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:22.340
 is because the terrain is very hilly,

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:24.500
 it's lots and lots of winding alleyways,

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:26.620
 and lots of steps connecting one place to the other,

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:28.820
 and you can't really get a car or anything around,

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:30.620
 it's even hard to get a bike around it.

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:32.180
 And so all you can do is,

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:34.340
 you can say I've got 17 heavy suitcases,

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:36.020
 and here's a small guy with a stick.

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:37.580
 Can he carry them all please?

00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:39.500
 And they do it, it's unbelievable,

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:40.780
 the loads that they carry.

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:42.460
 - There's not as many these days as though

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:44.700
 they're kind of going out, business a little bit.

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:46.780
 Yeah, there was a documentary quite recently

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:49.180
 called The Last Generation of Bang Bang,

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:51.660
 which was explaining that kind of these people

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:53.900
 have got other jobs now, like delivery people,

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:56.820
 like I don't know, delivery or that kind of thing.

00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:58.860
 Whatever the Chinese equivalent is,

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:00.300
 that's a lot of people do that.

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:01.380
 But they were really popular,

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:04.420
 there was a soap opera called Mountain City Bang Bang Men,

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:05.660
 which was all about them.

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:06.500
 - Really?

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:07.860
 - And there's also a drinking game,

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:09.500
 if you're a student in Chongqing,

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:11.180
 then you might play this game.

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:12.500
 And the drinking game is basically,

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:14.900
 whenever you see one of these guys, you drink.

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:15.740
 - Oh, right.

00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:16.580
 - Wow.

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:17.420
 - Wow, that was a game.

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:19.020
 - Oh no, people are so much more sober now.

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:20.540
 - Yes, they are.

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:23.460
 So Chongqing has, it's got a huge population,

00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:25.900
 it's like 32 million at the time

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:28.020
 where they were sort of at the peak before the decline,

00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:31.700
 there's about 30,000 stickmen that were in operation.

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:34.340
 But I was reading Chongqing, in my head,

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:36.100
 I was like, I know this place, how do I know this place?

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:40.420
 And it's because it has my favorite rail station,

00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:43.660
 in so a metro station, a train station in Chongqing,

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:46.060
 which is, they have them very high up,

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:48.980
 kind of like monorails that go round through the city.

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:51.900
 And one particular path that it needed to take

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:53.260
 was gonna be in the exact spot

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:55.060
 where they were building a residential building,

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:56.100
 which was 19 floors high.

00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:57.140
 - Oh, is that that?

00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:59.580
 - Yeah, so between floors six, I believe,

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:03.060
 and floors nine, I think those are the right ones,

00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:05.380
 they're suddenly in a residential building,

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:07.820
 a train that just goes through the building,

00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:09.940
 stops in the building as well.

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:10.780
 - Wow.

00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:12.780
 - Yeah, so it's in stop in the building,

00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:15.400
 and they had to soundproof all of the apartments

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:16.900
 to make sure that all the noise

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:18.260
 wouldn't get to them too much.

00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:19.260
 - Oh, my God.

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:21.300
 - Yeah, how cool is that, that's from Chongqing.

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:22.140
 - That's incredible.

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:22.980
 - Yeah.

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:26.260
 - I'm just sort of carrying extremely heavy weights.

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:28.740
 It is kind of unbelievable, so there are lots of people,

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:31.980
 particularly people who are mountain porters,

00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:34.660
 so this is, you know, very high altitude environments,

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:36.100
 can carry unbelievably heavy weights.

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:39.180
 So they studied mountain porters in Nepal,

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:41.900
 there was a scientist from Belgium called Norman Haglund,

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:43.420
 and he was a muscle physiologist,

00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:45.620
 and he thought, I've got to know what is different,

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:47.900
 like what is different physically

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:49.300
 about Nepalese mountain porters,

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:51.420
 'cause they, on average, the guys he studied

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:56.060
 weighed about 56 kilos, but they can carry 68 kilos.

00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:58.180
 They can carry more than their own body weight,

00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:01.100
 and they're carrying it uphill, steep uphill,

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:03.700
 and he studied them, and he found nothing different

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:05.420
 physically about them, except that they're just

00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:08.220
 extremely tough, that's the only thing he found.

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:11.460
 They, on average, they can carry 90% of their body weight.

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:15.900
 The heaviest load he found was 175% of the guy's weight

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:16.980
 that he was carrying. - That's really cool.

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:19.100
 - And by comparison, physically fit Westerners,

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:20.860
 you know, backpacking or whatever,

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:24.220
 you can do about 25% of your weight for a couple of days,

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:26.180
 and then it really, really hurts,

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:28.340
 and these guys have just done so much of it.

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:30.540
 - Yeah, but the other thing that he said that he noticed

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:32.500
 is that they're incredibly slow.

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:35.500
 They just keep to a pace, and so, for example,

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:37.980
 if they were going to a Saturday market

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:39.540
 and they were running late,

00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:41.860
 they would get up late before, you know,

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:44.980
 early in the morning, and they would just rather walk there

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:48.540
 at their super slow pace, rather than in any way be fast.

00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:50.140
 - Oh, really? - They'll go through the night.

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:51.140
 - Yeah, they'll go through the night,

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:52.940
 like fast is just not an option for them.

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:54.620
 They'll just, they pace themselves.

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:56.540
 - But basically, the lesson seemed to be,

00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:58.540
 we're really pathetic in the West.

00:29:58.540 --> 00:29:59.940
 I mean, that was his conclusion, wasn't it?

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:02.940
 He was like, well, it turns out there's not a special gate

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:04.340
 that they have that's really great.

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:06.660
 They're not actually using oxygen much more efficiently.

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:08.820
 We can just actually carry way more than 25%.

00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:11.180
 So next time you're off to help someone with their bags,

00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:13.300
 think twice, okay?

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:16.820
 'Cause we should be carrying this amount as well.

00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:18.980
 - There are some people in Europe who do this as well.

00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:22.140
 So in Slovakia, in the Tattris Mountains,

00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:24.700
 there are a load of hostels that are really high up,

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:26.380
 but there are no roads that get there,

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:28.100
 and so they have to take everything up there.

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:31.580
 So they'll take, if they need a refrigerator up there,

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:34.060
 they'll strap it to the back and just walk up.

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:36.060
 If there's a microwave, they'll strap it to the back

00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:37.380
 and just walk up.

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:40.260
 And the record, the amount that the strongest person

00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:43.220
 that's ever taken up to these hostels in Slovakia,

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:46.340
 it was going to the Lako Kalunga Castle Hotel,

00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:51.340
 and this guy carried 207 kilograms on his back to this place.

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:52.900
 And that, if you don't know what that is,

00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:55.700
 that's the equivalent to carrying a red deer,

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:59.060
 an upright piano, or all of Little Mix.

00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:00.900
 - Wow. - Whoa!

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:03.900
 - Wow. - Jesus.

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:06.540
 - That's really put Little Mix into context for me.

00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:09.860
 - We've all learned something from that comparison.

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:12.500
 - All of Little Mix, we're the same as one red deer.

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:14.580
 - I reckon. - Either red deer are a lot bigger

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:16.740
 than I thought, or Little Mix are a lot smaller.

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:19.700
 - The clue's in the name, the Little Mix, obviously.

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:22.620
 - Which Little Mix, because there were four, but now there's three.

00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:24.780
 - It's the four. - The four, okay.

00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:29.860
 - It's context. - Which sugar babes line up

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:32.100
 could he possibly have taken?

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:34.380
 - I was reading about porters, generally,

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:37.100
 and just seeing what roles they've played in history.

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:41.140
 And I found a really fun thing, which is in 1930,

00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:43.060
 a porter carrying some luggage

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:45.740
 led to the creation of the Association

00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:48.660
 for Mutual Help of the French Nobility.

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:50.380
 And this was two--

00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:53.060
 - It's a bit late for them, I think, by then, isn't it?

00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:55.180
 Because I've been with that 150 years earlier.

00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:56.140
 - This is the thing, right?

00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:59.300
 It's basically looking after all the noble people

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:00.460
 who fell from grace.

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:02.820
 So two people were walking along,

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:03.940
 they were having their luggage carried,

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:06.620
 and they suddenly noticed the person carrying the luggage

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:08.540
 was someone of noble stock.

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:10.260
 And they thought, hang on a second, what's going on?

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:11.940
 Why are you doing this menial job

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:17.020
 when you should be glorified in your family's right to be great?

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:19.460
 And they said, we need to give you some money.

00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:22.060
 And they thought, what if this is happening elsewhere in France?

00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:24.060
 And so they set up this association,

00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:26.980
 and people can still, to this day, apply for--

00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:29.740
 Yeah, please send my kid to a good school

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:31.140
 because we don't have enough money,

00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:33.420
 but we're from noble background, look at our surname.

00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:35.420
 - No. - And they bust a bunch of French people.

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:37.340
 You know what, if you're going to give some money to charity,

00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:40.540
 perhaps there are a few others other than the posh friend.

00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:45.300
 - No, absolutely not. I'm changing all my direct habits right now.

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:48.340
 - This is on-- they need another revolution.

00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:50.820
 Did they learn nothing?

00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:52.580
 - I wonder now how they noticed

00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:55.180
 that the guy carrying the bags was of noble stock.

00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:56.540
 That's the big question for me.

00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:58.220
 Like, did he have a birthmark?

00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:00.220
 - He was bleeding, his hands were bleeding

00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:02.260
 because of the blisters, and I guess the blue blood,

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:04.500
 does that give it away, maybe?

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:06.260
 - But what was it? What do we know what it was?

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:08.260
 - They just recognised maybe it was his manner,

00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:10.260
 maybe it could have been an old friend from school, I don't know.

00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:12.260
 - I bet he was just like, "Do you know,

00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:16.260
 "my great-uncle was the Baron of Orly."

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:18.260
 - Wow. - Wow.

00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:20.260
 - This is about carrying heavyweights.

00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:22.260
 It's not actually about humans carrying heavyweights,

00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:25.260
 but some dung beetles, which are called onthophagous taurus,

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:28.260
 they can pull 1100 times their own weight,

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:30.260
 which is very impressive,

00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:33.260
 and it's entirely evolved because of their sex life.

00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:37.260
 - Interesting, because I assume that all they're carrying is dung.

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:40.260
 - Well, dung is big, relative to them.

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:42.260
 - Oh, yeah, I'm not saying it.

00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:45.260
 - But in fact, you're right, sorry, it's not because of the dung moving.

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:48.260
 So the females will dig a tunnel under a cowpat.

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:51.260
 That's where they create this kind of tunnel of love

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:53.260
 where they're getting ready to mate.

00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:56.260
 - It certainly sounds like a sexy tunnel.

00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:58.260
 - For the dung beetle, unbelievably sexy.

00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:01.260
 And basically, so the female goes into the tunnel and waits,

00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:04.260
 and then a male will go into the tunnel, right, to mate.

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:06.260
 But sometimes a male will get into the tunnel

00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:08.260
 and find there's a rival male already there,

00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:11.260
 and they have evolved this unbelievably strong movement

00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:14.260
 where they fight, they tussle, and they lock horns,

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:17.260
 and they try and try and try to pull each other out

00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:19.260
 or push each other out of the tunnel.

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:21.260
 So as a result, they've evolved the ability to move

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:23.260
 a thousand times their own weight.

00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:26.260
 However, there are some males which are not like that.

00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:28.260
 They're sneaky males, they're not strong,

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:30.260
 but they are fast walkers,

00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:32.260
 and they have extremely dense testicles.

00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:34.260
 And they...

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:39.260
 Fast walkers with extremely dense testicles.

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:41.260
 What does that mean? - What does that mean?

00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:45.260
 Because you think that is slowing down.

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:50.260
 Yeah, but it could be the momentum can pull you forward sometimes.

00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:52.260
 You know, like, when you walk,

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:54.260
 and you kind of move your arms back and forward,

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:56.260
 and you could swing your testicles as you walk.

00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:59.260
 Yeah, standing long jump, you preponder so forward, yeah.

00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:01.260
 Anyway, so they sneak into the tunnels, attempt a shag,

00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:03.260
 attempt to get out quickly.

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:05.260
 So that just... The woman turns out she prefers

00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:07.260
 to dense testicles to the extremely strong ones.

00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:09.260
 Is that the idea? How are they winning?

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:11.260
 It's not clear what criteria she's applying.

00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:13.260
 I think if there's a male there, she'll mate with it.

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:15.260
 I've not got my head around the dense testicle thing.

00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:17.260
 What is that doing? Like, what is it?

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:19.260
 Well, they've just got...

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:21.260
 It just means they're producing a lot of sperm,

00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:23.260
 and they can quickly get in, mate, and get out.

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:26.260
 And they're putting all of their resources into sperm quality

00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:28.260
 rather than into physical power.

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:31.260
 But how do you tell someone that your sperm quality is great?

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:33.260
 I don't think they're communicating on this level, but we're...

00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:35.260
 Right.

00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:37.260
 If there's a male there, the female will mate with it,

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:39.260
 and he turns up and says...

00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:41.260
 It gets in there. There's no flirting, I think.

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:43.260
 It's a bit like... You're in a tunnel under a cowpat.

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:45.260
 I think the romance is pretty dead.

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:47.260
 LAUGHTER

00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:54.260
 I was looking at other jobs that you could describe as being like porters,

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:57.260
 and I was thinking one of my favourite things that I read a while back

00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:00.260
 is that Scottish fishermen's wives

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:03.260
 were basically porters of their husbands.

00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:05.260
 So this is...

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:08.260
 In the 19th century, the herring industry was massive in Scotland.

00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:11.260
 Everyone was a herring farmer, herring fisherman.

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:15.260
 And the fishermen, when they went to get in their boats,

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:17.260
 they would usually have sea...

00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:19.260
 They would go from a beach,

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:21.260
 so they'd go off from a beach, get in a boat,

00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:24.260
 and they don't want to get wet because they're going to be out all day,

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:26.260
 and it's fucking cold in Scotland.

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:29.260
 And so the wives would always carry their husbands into the boat.

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:31.260
 So you'll see their old photos of these husbands

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:33.260
 with all their fishing tackle in their arms,

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:35.260
 and their wives just carrying them like a baby

00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:37.260
 and plopping them into that little boat,

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:39.260
 waving them off for the packed lunch.

00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:41.260
 That's amazing.

00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:46.260
 The man who has carried the heaviest load for 10 metres in history

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:48.260
 was a guy called Patrick Bobonian,

00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:51.260
 and at the end of walking the 10 metres, he shouted out,

00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:53.260
 "Vegan power!"

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:55.260
 Nice. Yeah.

00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:58.260
 And he was trying to prove that you can still be strong

00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:00.260
 and have a vegan diet.

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:02.260
 They interviewed him afterwards and said,

00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:05.260
 "It was a bit of a stupid thing to do, and it really hurt."

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:10.260
 If only I'd had a sausage sandwich before I said no.

00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:13.260
 Time for our final fact, and that is my fact.

00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:16.260
 My fact this week is that in 1994,

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:21.260
 the music group, the KLF, burnt one million pounds.

00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:26.260
 27 years later, they're still not sure why they did it

00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:28.260
 and have even toured the UK,

00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:32.260
 asking audiences if they have any idea why they did it.

00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:38.260
 So this was a very famous moment in '90s music.

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:40.260
 KLF were a massive band.

00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:42.260
 Justified and Ancient was a huge...

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:45.260
 They were huge. Their singles were massive selling,

00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:49.260
 but they were very artistic and they were very anti the industry,

00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:52.260
 and they decided that they were going to absolutely

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:55.260
 whiten themselves out in a way that a band has never done before.

00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:58.260
 They were going to take all their music away from catalogs

00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:00.260
 that were publishing it.

00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:02.260
 They were going to remove it from all shops,

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:04.260
 and they were going to take the last amount of money

00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:06.260
 that they'd made, which was a million pounds,

00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:09.260
 take it out of their account and take it to an island,

00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:13.260
 a juror, which is in Scotland, and they went to a boat shed,

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:16.260
 and they set it alight, and they burnt a million pounds.

00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:19.260
 And there's a lot of controversy. Did they really do it?

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:21.260
 They claim they absolutely did.

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:23.260
 A lot of people are very skeptical.

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:26.260
 There's been a few investigations into it where the BBC have seen

00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:28.260
 that they've taken the money out from the bank,

00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:31.260
 and they've found little bits of burnt embers

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:35.260
 that matched when little numbers that would appear on specific bills

00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:38.260
 kind of matched the ones that were taken from the bank.

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:41.260
 But did they really do it? Is a question a lot of people have?

00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:43.260
 I think they did. James, I think you're a sceptical.

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:46.260
 I think they didn't. Just on balance of probability,

00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:48.260
 I think they didn't. They might have done.

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:50.260
 Quite often we have facts on this, and I'm like,

00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:52.260
 "That's definitely bullshit."

00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:54.260
 This one, I'm about 60/40 that it's bullshit.

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:58.260
 But for instance, the little bits of burnt notes that they found,

00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:00.260
 they were found by a farmer,

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:02.260
 but it turned out that the farmer's son had gone to school

00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:04.260
 with one of the band.

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:07.260
 So it's quite a nice coincidence that they found it.

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:11.260
 I read an interview with the journalist who first wrote it up.

00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:14.260
 He was called Michael Pilgrim, who's working for the Observer magazine,

00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:17.260
 and he says that he still doesn't know for sure

00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:19.260
 whether it was true or whether it wasn't true.

00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:21.260
 I think that was the journalist who received the story,

00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:23.260
 but he wasn't there. It was Jim Reid who was there.

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:25.260
 Sorry, he wrote it up. Yeah, yeah.

00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:28.260
 So Jim Reid thought they definitely did it, I think.

00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:31.260
 And this guy reckons that they definitely burnt some money

00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:34.260
 because he has some of the money that was burnt in his house,

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:37.260
 but he thinks possibly not a million pounds,

00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:39.260
 which I think is where I stand on it.

00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:42.260
 In 2017, they were discussing it

00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:44.260
 at this festival that Don was talking about,

00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:46.260
 where they asked audiences why they did it,

00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:49.260
 and they got an economist to describe it as quantitative tightening,

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:52.260
 which is a really good phrase.

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:55.260
 And there are acts who are burning money today,

00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:58.260
 so there's an organisation called Burn Your Money,

00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:01.260
 which sent some members in 2017 to the island of Jura

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:03.260
 to burn some of their own money.

00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:05.260
 And they even have their own magazine, this organisation,

00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:07.260
 which is called Burning Issue.

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:10.260
 Why are they doing that, just to imitate the grace?

00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:12.260
 Why do the initial guys do it? Yeah, exactly.

00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:15.260
 So initially, after they did it,

00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:17.260
 there was a documentary made about it,

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:19.260
 because they had a friend called Gimpo who was with them,

00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:21.260
 who filmed it, so we do have footage of this stuff.

00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:23.260
 Now, what's his real name, was it?

00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:25.260
 I can't even remember. He's called Alan Goodrich.

00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:27.260
 Right, Alan Goodrich.

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:29.260
 And so you can be sure if he's called Gimpo,

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:31.260
 it's probably not his real name.

00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:33.260
 It could be Mark's brother, I don't know.

00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:36.260
 To Mr and Mrs Goodrich, a son, Gimpo.

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:39.260
 So they took this video around the country,

00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:41.260
 and they asked these questions, you know,

00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:43.260
 "Why do you think we did it?"

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:45.260
 Because they genuinely couldn't quite work it out,

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:48.260
 but they are an artistic band, and there's a...

00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:52.260
 So I got this fact from a book that's called The KLF by John Higgs.

00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:55.260
 It is genuinely, I think, the best non-fiction book I've ever read.

00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:57.260
 Genuinely, it's my favourite non-fiction book.

00:40:57.260 --> 00:41:00.260
 It's magical, and it's not just about this band.

00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:02.260
 It's about what they encompass,

00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:05.260
 the worlds of the occult, the esoteric,

00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:07.260
 everything that was going on in pop music.

00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:09.260
 It's just... John Higgs, stunning.

00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:12.260
 And basically, what they decided was,

00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:14.260
 after they went around showing this video,

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:17.260
 and not getting anywhere, but getting a lot of people furious with them,

00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:20.260
 that they would not talk about it for years and years and years.

00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:23.260
 So they signed a contract on the side of a car, a rented car,

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:27.260
 pushed it off a cliff as an official contract,

00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:30.260
 and didn't really talk about it for 23 years.

00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:32.260
 It usually came up in conversations.

00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:35.260
 I bet it came up in conversations with the car rental firm.

00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:39.260
 That film was really interesting, because they filmed it,

00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:44.260
 and then they kind of destroyed the camcorder.

00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:46.260
 But then the person who filmed it, who was Gimpo, said,

00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:50.260
 "Oh, actually, I'd already made a copy of it, so we can have that instead."

00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:52.260
 And he turned that into a little film.

00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:56.260
 And they advertised that they were going to show it in Brick Lane in London,

00:41:56.260 --> 00:42:00.260
 and that anyone who turned up could get free lager.

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:02.260
 So lots of people turned up.

00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:05.260
 But too many people turned up, so they had to cancel the whole event.

00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:11.260
 And they were stuck with 6,237 cans of Tenant Super.

00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:13.260
 This was on Christmas Eve,

00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:16.260
 and they decided to give it to the homeless.

00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:24.260
 Before someone working for the charity Crisis said they were utterly irresponsible.

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:30.260
 I think they were the first people to describe them as that, I suspect.

00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:34.260
 It sounds like the maddest experience to be on this money-burning expedition.

00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:36.260
 I wish I'd been that one journalist.

00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:38.260
 And they were so random in what they did.

00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:41.260
 They just picked this guy at Jim Reid, and called him up.

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:43.260
 He doesn't know what he's getting into.

00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:46.260
 He's told to get in the car with these two guys, and Gimpo in the back.

00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:50.260
 They buy suitcases in London, two massive suitcases.

00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:54.260
 They go to a security firm and extract all of this cash.

00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:56.260
 And then disappear to Jura.

00:42:56.260 --> 00:43:00.260
 And it sounds so annoying as well, because he'd be so knackered after that long, confusing day.

00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:02.260
 And they said, "Okay, we're going to burn all the money tomorrow."

00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:06.260
 And then Gimpo goes to bed, writes off his notes for the day, puts his head on the pillow,

00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:08.260
 and immediately they bang on his hotel door at midnight and go,

00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:11.260
 "Actually, we're going to do it now. Come on, we can't wait."

00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:12.260
 They said it was like Christmas.

00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:15.260
 You know, you're so excited, you can't wait till the morning.

00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:21.260
 And yeah, they went and they did it in this little, I think it was like a little stone kind of structure.

00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:26.260
 But he said, "The first thing you feel is incredibly guilty as you're watching this money disappear."

00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:31.260
 And then for the subsequent two or three hours, because it does take quite a long time to burn a million pounds,

00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:35.260
 you are just really bored for a lot of it.

00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:37.260
 But yeah, so surreal.

00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:42.260
 Well, the line that someone said about it was, it's one thing to start burning a million pounds.

00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:45.260
 It's another thing to finish burning a million pounds.

00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:50.260
 And that is something that has really made them really question everything,

00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:52.260
 the fact that they went for the whole thing.

00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:56.260
 Well, it made people so angry, because obviously they could have given that money to charity.

00:43:56.260 --> 00:44:01.260
 They could have given it to, you know, members of the French aristocracy who would dance all their life.

00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:04.260
 They could have just kept it and pretended that they burnt it.

00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:06.260
 Yeah, you know.

00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:10.260
 Lots of people said that if you burn money by spending it on cocaine or whatever,

00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:14.260
 then you're forgiven much more easily than burning physical money.

00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:18.260
 It feels very sacrilegious.

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:21.260
 But they were constantly doing stuff like this.

00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:24.260
 They tried to spend their money in very creative ways.

00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:27.260
 So after they'd had a really big hit of one or another with their big hits,

00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:33.260
 they tried to spend the money they got from that, getting a massive helicopter and fixing Stonehenge,

00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:37.260
 so that they could put it back to work again basically.

00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:40.260
 They could come on, let's fire up the motors.

00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:43.260
 I think also Bulldozer, they were going to bulldoze it down.

00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:45.260
 They bought a big bulldozer to do that.

00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:50.260
 And didn't they bury their Brittle wards underneath, supposedly?

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:51.260
 I guess.

00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:54.260
 I think I was conveniently found a few weeks later by a friend.

00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:56.260
 You're very skeptical about this.

00:44:56.260 --> 00:45:01.260
 Well, you know, it might be true, but the thing is they did have form for lots of little tricks and stuff.

00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:05.260
 So they made crop circles, for instance.

00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:11.260
 There was one time where one of the guys drove around with a massive sound equipment in his car,

00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:15.260
 which he claimed was powerful enough to kill livestock.

00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:16.260
 Right, wow.

00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:18.260
 He was going to kill a load of cars with this massive thing.

00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:19.260
 Wow.

00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:24.260
 They could kill one red deer with this sound system, or four of them.

00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:25.260
 You decide.

00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:27.260
 And so it's two guys, the KLF.

00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:32.260
 It's Drummond and Corti, and Bill Drummond, I love reading about Bill Drummond.

00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:33.260
 His ideas are just so wonderful.

00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:37.260
 One thing that he did, and I don't know if this is still going, I hope he still does it,

00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:41.260
 but Bill Drummond created a soup line across the British Isles.

00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:47.260
 And the idea was if anyone lives on Bill Drummond's soup line, you can look it up.

00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:51.260
 If you live and your house happens to be on the soup line, you can contact Bill Drummond,

00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:53.260
 and he'll come to your house and make you some soup.

00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:54.260
 That's...

00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:55.260
 No.

00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:58.260
 Did anyone... Did it work? Can we do that?

00:45:58.260 --> 00:45:59.260
 I hope it's still going.

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:01.260
 I'm not sure, but the soup line exists, and he did do that.

00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:05.260
 You'd have to plan it carefully so it didn't go through a major place, like Belfast.

00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:07.260
 No, it's incredible.

00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:08.260
 The soup line.

00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:09.260
 Wow.

00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:11.260
 He sounds wonderful.

00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:16.260
 The Guardian interviewed him in 2000, which was years and years after they burned the money,

00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:18.260
 and they asked him, "Have you regretted it since?"

00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:19.260
 He said, "No."

00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:21.260
 "Are you financially stable now?"

00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:23.260
 "No, I'm not. No."

00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:26.260
 And then in 2004, he said, "Of course I regretted it."

00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:29.260
 And so you can't work out the truth about them.

00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:30.260
 No.

00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:32.260
 They're really, really, really interesting people.

00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:35.260
 One thing about Drummond is he does like his lines,

00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:41.260
 and he believes that there's a lay line that goes from Iceland to Papua New Guinea,

00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:43.260
 and it goes through Liverpool,

00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:46.260
 and the energy of the Earth comes down from space into Reykjavik,

00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:49.260
 goes all the way under the Earth, and then comes out of Papua New Guinea,

00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:52.260
 and also comes out of a manhole cover in Liverpool.

00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:56.260
 And this manhole cover is just outside the cabin club,

00:46:56.260 --> 00:46:58.260
 and that's what he kind of thinks.

00:46:58.260 --> 00:46:59.260
 Yeah, Matthew Street, yeah.

00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:00.260
 Exactly.

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:03.260
 And one time, he was the manager of Echo and the Bunnyman,

00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:05.260
 who a lot of you will know, a band,

00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:08.260
 and he got them a gig in Reykjavik, got them to play,

00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:13.260
 and then stood over this manhole cover to listen to see if the music came out.

00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:15.260
 I did not come out.

00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:19.260
 But part of his evidence is, you know Carl Jung, the psychoanalyst?

00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:20.260
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:24.260
 So Carl Jung apparently wrote once that he'd never been to Liverpool,

00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:26.260
 but he had a dream about Liverpool,

00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:31.260
 and he thought, Carl Jung said Liverpool is a pool of life it makes to live,

00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:34.260
 and there's a statue of Carl Jung on Matthew Street.

00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:37.260
 Yeah, it's a bust that sits up in a building,

00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:39.260
 because there was a guy called Peter O'Halligan who'd heard.

00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:42.260
 So this was a game-changing dream of Carl Jung's life.

00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:45.260
 He was like the pool of life, and then he said it's in Liverpool,

00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:47.260
 and Peter O'Halligan went around,

00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:51.260
 and he looked for descriptions that would match where Jung might have dreamed in his head,

00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:55.260
 and he discovered that there was this manhole sitting at the end

00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:58.260
 of literally 30 seconds' walk from the cavern,

00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:03.260
 which is why maybe the Beatles had such mystic powers and so on.

00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:06.260
 And presumably... Have I lost everyone?

00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:08.260
 Presumably Jung didn't believe any of this,

00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:12.260
 but thought it was a chaos against anything, or really believes it.

00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:15.260
 I think he might believe some of it, although we'd have to get him here,

00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:17.260
 we're just... I wish we could get him here.

00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:21.260
 On his 60th birthday, he stood for 17 hours on that manhole.

00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:23.260
 He didn't believe it, yeah. 17 hours.

00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:25.260
 Thinking about life, thinking about what he was doing.

00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:28.260
 Yeah, it's an important manhole.

00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:31.260
 I think we've mentioned before that Jeremy Corbyn also collects manhole covers.

00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:33.260
 He does. Well, he doesn't collect them.

00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:35.260
 Sorry, that makes him sound incredibly irresponsible,

00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:38.260
 but he is an expert on them. He knows about them.

00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:41.260
 He collects him trying to tug it from out from under drama.

00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:44.260
 You're not getting this one!

00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:49.260
 Just to draw us back towards the realms of the possible for a bit,

00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:51.260
 that music is really interesting,

00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:55.260
 because they were hugely influential in starting sampling other tracks.

00:48:55.260 --> 00:48:56.260
 Yes.

00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:58.260
 And they were one of some of the first people to do that.

00:48:58.260 --> 00:49:02.260
 So in 1987, they sampled a passage from "Dancing Queen" by ABBA,

00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:06.260
 and ABBA were not happy about it, and ABBA sued them

00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:10.260
 and said, "You've got to destroy all the unsolved copies of this record

00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:13.260
 that you've produced, all the unsolved vinyl records."

00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:16.260
 So then, the KLF, the two of them, they travelled to Stockholm

00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:20.260
 to give Agnita from ABBA a commemorative gold disc.

00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:24.260
 They couldn't find her, because they were just walking around in Stockholm.

00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:29.260
 So they gave the gold disc to a random prostitute they met in the street

00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:33.260
 and came home, pausing only to throw the LPs off the ferry as they went.

00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:35.260
 And then they burned the rest in a field.

00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:37.260
 They love burning things in fields, the KLF.

00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:40.260
 They love burning stuff, and they love throwing stuff into the sea.

00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:43.260
 It's true. It's their jam, and I dig it.

00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:47.260
 That trip to Sweden sounds very entertaining.

00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:52.260
 They did sit outside ABBA's record label in a police car that they'd managed to get hold of,

00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:57.260
 and they blasted the record that they made from which they'd stolen ABBA's music out at ABBA's record label.

00:49:57.260 --> 00:49:58.260
 And then they...

00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:00.260
 Imagine being inside the office for that. That's thrilling.

00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:02.260
 You know, the police are here. What do they want?

00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:03.260
 It's hard to tell.

00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:07.260
 Is this a new siren?

00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:09.260
 Very confusing.

00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:11.260
 They killed a moose accidentally.

00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:14.260
 They hit and killed a moose on that trip.

00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:17.260
 And also, they were shot at by a farmer who didn't understand

00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:19.260
 and we didn't like them burning shit in his field.

00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:21.260
 But they're never getting permission for anything.

00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:23.260
 So the farmer's just looking out of his window, and he's like,

00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:27.260
 "Oh my God, two musicians are burning huge piles of music in my crop field."

00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:32.260
 And so they shot their car, and they claimed they had to be towed back to England by the AA.

00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:35.260
 Which I didn't know the AA did call out to Gothenburg, but...

00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:36.260
 They're very good.

00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:40.260
 So Andy mentioned 2017.

00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:42.260
 They had a panel to talk about why they did it.

00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:45.260
 So there was this thing, when they pushed the car off the edge of the cliff,

00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:48.260
 23 years they said, "We're not going to talk about it."

00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:51.260
 And we will, in 23 years' time, have the answer,

00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:53.260
 "Why did we burn this money?"

00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:58.260
 So they set up this big festival where they were going to answer the question in 2017.

00:50:58.260 --> 00:51:01.260
 And there's an amazing hour of footage you can watch on YouTube,

00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:05.260
 just from one person filming the whole thing, where the KLF return.

00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:09.260
 And they've got a big announcement, and they arrive in an ice cream van,

00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:11.260
 and they've written a new book.

00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:15.260
 And their big announcement, outside of trying to answer why they did the money burning,

00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:21.260
 is that they're now no longer just musicians, but they're in the funeral business as well.

00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:24.260
 And what they've done is, in Toxteth, in Liverpool...

00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:28.260
 They'll burn you in a field, they'll throw you into the ocean.

00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:32.260
 They've set up this idea that you can buy, and I've seen it online,

00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:34.260
 and I almost bought a brick the other day.

00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:38.260
 You can buy a brick where you put in, if someone's passed away,

00:51:38.260 --> 00:51:42.260
 a milligram, I think it is, or a few milligrams of the ashes of that person,

00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:47.260
 and it gets baked into the brick, and they're building a ginormous pyramid in Toxteth,

00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:53.260
 where every year they add new bricks to it, and it's going to be something 30-something thousand bricks.

00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:56.260
 That happens to do it, I think. They haven't started yet, have they?

00:51:56.260 --> 00:52:00.260
 How have they got planning permission from the people of Toxteth?

00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:02.260
 Because I imagine there'll be questions about this huge...

00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:05.260
 Yeah, the Toxteth Day of the Dead, it happens on November 23rd.

00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:07.260
 It's going to happen this year, I'm going to it.

00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:08.260
 Toxteth Day of the Dead?

00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:11.260
 Yeah, it's a big festival, they walk through the streets...

00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:13.260
 It's not a big festival.

00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:15.260
 It's not Glastonbury.

00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:17.260
 It's a couple of old rockers.

00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:19.260
 I've never heard of it, yeah.

00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:21.260
 No, it's new. 2017 was the first one.

00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:25.260
 Yeah, it's about 400 people, and they would walk through the cities of Toxteth,

00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:28.260
 wearing the classic Day of the Dead sort of stuff.

00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:32.260
 You would buy a ticket, and you didn't know what to expect, you didn't know what you would do,

00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:38.260
 and they would take the numbers, and if you were number one to 20 or something,

00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:42.260
 you would have to form a band, and then the next people would have to get a tattoo done.

00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:45.260
 It was like Taskmaster, really, it's pretty much like that.

00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:50.260
 And another group had to commandeer as many supermarket trolleys as they could,

00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:52.260
 and stuff like that.

00:52:52.260 --> 00:52:55.260
 But before they did this, before they started doing this pyramid,

00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:57.260
 which they will probably do,

00:52:57.260 --> 00:53:01.260
 they had another idea where they wanted to build a pyramid containing the same amount of bricks

00:53:01.260 --> 00:53:04.260
 as there were people born in the 20th century.

00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:06.260
 It's quite a nice idea, isn't it?

00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:07.260
 How is that?

00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:09.260
 Well, unfortunately, it's ten billion.

00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:12.260
 The Great Pyramid in Giza has 2.3 million.

00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:14.260
 Right.

00:53:14.260 --> 00:53:16.260
 So it would have been a hell of a pyramid.

00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:19.260
 Yeah, tiny bricks, and then LEGO bricks.

00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:23.260
 Are they selling those bricks in it?

00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:25.260
 Is it a pyramid scheme?

00:53:25.260 --> 00:53:27.260
 That's what I'm trying to say.

00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:28.260
 Thank you.

00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:29.260
 Thank you.

00:53:29.260 --> 00:53:30.260
 Very nice.

00:53:30.260 --> 00:53:32.260
 Hey, we've got to wrap up.

00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:34.260
 We can't end on that.

00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:37.260
 That is it, that is all of our facts.

00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:39.260
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:41.260

 Is Andrew Hunter in?

00:53:51.260 --> 00:53:54.260
 But please don't write about the pyramid scheme thing.

00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:56.260
 I'm sorry.
