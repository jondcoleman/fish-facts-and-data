00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:15,"- Hello, and welcome to another episode"
00:00:15,00:00:18,"of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast,"
00:00:18,00:00:22,this week coming to you live from New York.
00:00:22,00:00:24,(crowd cheering)
00:00:29,00:00:31,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:31,00:00:34,"I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,"
00:00:34,00:00:36,"Andrew Humpton Murray, and James Harkin."
00:00:36,00:00:38,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:38,00:00:42,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:42,00:00:45,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:45,00:00:49,"Starting with fact number one, and that is James."
00:00:49,00:00:51,"- Okay, my fact this week is that actually,"
00:00:51,00:00:53,squids don't play games.
00:00:53,00:00:56,(crowd laughing)
00:00:58,00:01:01,It's not so much a fact as a passive aggressive message
00:01:01,00:01:02,to Netflix.
00:01:02,00:01:04,(crowd laughing)
00:01:04,00:01:06,"- Oh yeah, got their IMDB ratings"
00:01:06,00:01:09,when James Harkin gets onto it.
00:01:09,00:01:11,- I think you will find.
00:01:11,00:01:14,- Is that show anything to do with squid playing games?
00:01:14,00:01:15,- No. - Have you rumbled them?
00:01:15,00:01:17,"No, right? - I haven't, no."
00:01:17,00:01:18,- It's just a silly thing.
00:01:18,00:01:20,"Basically, I was reading about play"
00:01:20,00:01:23,and about games and the evolution of playing.
00:01:23,00:01:25,And I wanted to see what animals do play
00:01:25,00:01:27,"and what animals don't play, and for obvious reasons,"
00:01:27,00:01:29,I thought I'd see if squid play games.
00:01:29,00:01:32,And I found an article in the Journal of Current Biology
00:01:32,00:01:37,called Fun and Play in Invertebrates by Sarah Zelinski.
00:01:37,00:01:39,And she says there is no evidence in play
00:01:39,00:01:42,for cuttlefish or squids as defined
00:01:42,00:01:43,by Berghardt's five criteria.
00:01:43,00:01:46,So there's like these criteria you use in biology
00:01:46,00:01:48,to find out if someone's playing
00:01:48,00:01:49,"or if something is playing, I should say."
00:01:49,00:01:52,"So it's, they do something that's not functional."
00:01:52,00:01:54,They do it voluntarily.
00:01:54,00:01:56,They do it different to the way they normally do it.
00:01:56,00:01:58,So it's slightly changed.
00:01:58,00:02:00,They repeat it and they do it when they're not under stress.
00:02:00,00:02:03,"And if they do all those things, then that counts as play."
00:02:03,00:02:04,- It's interesting that not under stress
00:02:04,00:02:06,"is a criteria for play,"
00:02:06,00:02:07,because I think I was pretty stressed
00:02:07,00:02:09,throughout the playground years.
00:02:09,00:02:11,(audience laughing)
00:02:11,00:02:13,- You weren't playing when people were holding you down
00:02:13,00:02:14,on the floor and--
00:02:14,00:02:17,"- I was working, avoiding being it."
00:02:17,00:02:19,"And it was hard, and I lost all the time."
00:02:19,00:02:22,- And I suppose one kind of interesting thing about that
00:02:22,00:02:24,"is most invertebrates don't,"
00:02:24,00:02:26,so invertebrates things without a backbone.
00:02:26,00:02:27,"Most of them don't play,"
00:02:27,00:02:30,"but octopuses that are very closely related to squid,"
00:02:30,00:02:31,they do play.
00:02:31,00:02:32,So it's kind of interesting
00:02:32,00:02:34,that those two related things do.
00:02:34,00:02:38,"- And so have we, you know, had them in tanks"
00:02:38,00:02:40,and sort of like plop chestboards down
00:02:40,00:02:41,and sort of like monopoly?
00:02:41,00:02:44,Like have we actively tried to get them to play?
00:02:44,00:02:45,- Monopoly.
00:02:45,00:02:46,"- No, they don't do that,"
00:02:46,00:02:48,"but they, you know, they've studied them"
00:02:48,00:02:49,many times over the years.
00:02:49,00:02:51,"And with things like octopuses,"
00:02:51,00:02:53,they've just noticed that they happen to do this.
00:02:53,00:02:54,"So octopuses will,"
00:02:54,00:02:56,they'll kind of get like a little crab.
00:02:56,00:02:58,"And when they're full,"
00:02:58,00:02:59,"so they don't want to eat the crab,"
00:02:59,00:03:01,"they'll do it like a cat does with a mouse,"
00:03:01,00:03:02,"so they'll catch it,"
00:03:02,00:03:03,and then they'll let it go
00:03:03,00:03:04,"and go a little bit further,"
00:03:04,00:03:07,and then they'll catch it again and stuff like that.
00:03:07,00:03:08,"So that counts as playing,"
00:03:08,00:03:09,'cause it's just for fun.
00:03:09,00:03:11,"It's like not exactly the same as catching a crab,"
00:03:11,00:03:13,but it's very slightly similar to catching crabs.
00:03:13,00:03:14,- Yeah.
00:03:14,00:03:18,- I feel like squid have a bit of a reputation
00:03:18,00:03:20,"as kind of the poor cousin of the octopus,"
00:03:20,00:03:22,"'cause the octopus is so charismatic,"
00:03:22,00:03:23,it's so intelligent.
00:03:23,00:03:25,We keep being told they're as intelligent
00:03:25,00:03:27,as a bright 12-year-old.
00:03:27,00:03:28,"They could do GCSEs, all of this,"
00:03:28,00:03:30,and squid are sort of the...
00:03:30,00:03:31,- Like a good bully Andy in the playground.
00:03:31,00:03:33,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:03:33,00:03:36,"And squid are kind of the thick cousins,"
00:03:36,00:03:38,"and they're just good for calamari,"
00:03:38,00:03:40,but they're brilliant.
00:03:40,00:03:40,They're really brilliant.
00:03:40,00:03:42,And there are so many varieties of squid as well.
00:03:42,00:03:45,So one of them I found out
00:03:45,00:03:47,"in the course of this squid game thing,"
00:03:47,00:03:50,"Grimel de Tuthis bonplandi, okay?"
00:03:50,00:03:52,This is a particular kind of squid.
00:03:52,00:03:55,And it is a squid which uses a squid
00:03:55,00:03:58,within a squid method of catching prey.
00:03:58,00:03:59,It is so cool.
00:03:59,00:04:01,"It has these tentacles, right?"
00:04:01,00:04:01,- Yeah.
00:04:01,00:04:03,- And nice long tentacles.
00:04:03,00:04:05,"And they look in low light,"
00:04:05,00:04:08,and it swims in an area of the sea with quite low light.
00:04:08,00:04:09,"In low light, the ends of these tentacles"
00:04:09,00:04:11,"look like baby squid, okay?"
00:04:11,00:04:13,And they leer in predators.
00:04:13,00:04:15,"And it flaps them around like a baby squid,"
00:04:15,00:04:16,bobbing around helplessly.
00:04:16,00:04:17,"And it leers in predators,"
00:04:17,00:04:20,the kind of predators which like to eat baby squid.
00:04:20,00:04:23,"And then, ah-ha-ha, it eats the predators"
00:04:23,00:04:25,which turn up expecting a helpless baby squid.
00:04:25,00:04:27,- That's right. - It turns out it's attached
00:04:27,00:04:28,to this gigantic squid. - But it might be quite confusing
00:04:28,00:04:31,if like your hand looked like your child.
00:04:31,00:04:32,Would that not be weird?
00:04:32,00:04:33,- Yeah.
00:04:33,00:04:34,- Like you might accidentally feed it
00:04:34,00:04:35,or put a nappy on it or something?
00:04:35,00:04:36,- True.
00:04:36,00:04:37,- I think it's more like
00:04:37,00:04:39,"they're just doing finger puppet shows to each other,"
00:04:39,00:04:40,which is just really entertaining.
00:04:40,00:04:43,"- But lethal finger puppet shows, you know?"
00:04:43,00:04:44,"- Yeah, sure."
00:04:44,00:04:45,Where you eat the audience at the end.
00:04:45,00:04:46,That's how mine always went.
00:04:46,00:04:48,"It's a good, yeah, they are great."
00:04:48,00:04:50,"So there's one squid called,"
00:04:50,00:04:53,"confusingly called Octopoteuthis deletron,"
00:04:53,00:04:55,but it's a squid not an octopus.
00:04:55,00:04:57,"And it's, I think it's the only squid they've found so far"
00:04:57,00:04:59,that intentionally rips off its arms.
00:04:59,00:05:02,And it does it to defend or attack.
00:05:02,00:05:03,And this--
00:05:03,00:05:04,- What?
00:05:04,00:05:05,How?
00:05:05,00:05:06,"- So attack, does he rip off an arm"
00:05:06,00:05:07,and hit someone with it?
00:05:07,00:05:10,- I think it's more like distraction.
00:05:10,00:05:13,- Rather than-- - That would be distracting.
00:05:13,00:05:14,- If you're in the middle of a boxing fight
00:05:14,00:05:17,"with Chris Eubank Jr. and he pulls his arm off,"
00:05:17,00:05:17,"you'd be like, what?"
00:05:17,00:05:19,"Yeah, and then he could clock you in the head"
00:05:19,00:05:21,with the other arm still attached.
00:05:21,00:05:23,But it's gonna be his last fight.
00:05:23,00:05:25,"So, yeah, this woman was studying them"
00:05:25,00:05:28,and a quarter of these squid have at least one blunt arm.
00:05:28,00:05:30,"A lot of, as in an arm, which was missing a bit."
00:05:30,00:05:33,And they can ditch them at any kind of joint.
00:05:33,00:05:35,They can ditch them at various bits up the arm.
00:05:35,00:05:38,So you only need to drop the bit that's being threatened.
00:05:38,00:05:39,And it's so cool.
00:05:39,00:05:41,This researcher was called Stephanie Bush.
00:05:41,00:05:42,And she collected a bunch of squid
00:05:42,00:05:44,to put in tanks in her lab.
00:05:44,00:05:48,And loads of them immediately shed their arms at her
00:05:48,00:05:48,trying to get away.
00:05:48,00:05:50,"And she said there was one of them,"
00:05:50,00:05:52,"which was when in the lab,"
00:05:52,00:05:53,it grasped the bottom of the container
00:05:53,00:05:54,with its arm hooks.
00:05:54,00:05:56,They've got little hooks on their arms.
00:05:56,00:05:59,It somersaulted repeatedly and released ink
00:05:59,00:06:02,as it detached part of all eight of its arms.
00:06:02,00:06:04,"- Whoa! - And as they released the arms,"
00:06:04,00:06:05,"they flashed 'cause, you know,"
00:06:05,00:06:06,they can emit their own light squids.
00:06:06,00:06:08,So all the arms got released
00:06:08,00:06:11,and then flashed lightning bolts through the water.
00:06:11,00:06:13,- That is amazing. - This is horrifying.
00:06:13,00:06:16,- They're also one of the few squid that has a penis.
00:06:16,00:06:18,"- Yeah. - The octopotuthis diletron,"
00:06:18,00:06:19,was it? - Yes.
00:06:19,00:06:21,"- So yeah, they have a penis"
00:06:21,00:06:24,and they have sex by depositing sperm
00:06:24,00:06:27,"on the body of the females, the males do."
00:06:27,00:06:28,"Although I say females,"
00:06:28,00:06:30,actually they're pretty indiscriminate
00:06:30,00:06:33,because they live where it's quite dark
00:06:33,00:06:36,and researchers have looked at all the different squids
00:06:36,00:06:38,that have squid semen on them.
00:06:38,00:06:40,And it's pretty much 50/50 male and female.
00:06:40,00:06:42,"- Right. - They'll just,"
00:06:42,00:06:44,"if they see a squid, they'll go for it."
00:06:44,00:06:46,"- Oh, cool. - They're desperate."
00:06:46,00:06:48,"- Yeah, that's amazing."
00:06:48,00:06:50,- A lot of these squid go their whole lives
00:06:50,00:06:52,without meeting another squid.
00:06:52,00:06:53,"- Really? - This is why they're so desperate, yeah."
00:06:53,00:06:55,"So when they see one, you can't blame them."
00:06:55,00:06:57,"- Right, oh god. - It's kind of sad."
00:06:57,00:06:59,"- Have, you know, have a chat first or, you know,"
00:06:59,00:07:02,"some, a drink and just go straight in for the shag."
00:07:02,00:07:04,"- Yeah, fair."
00:07:04,00:07:06,- I was looking up squid games
00:07:06,00:07:07,and I actually found something the opposite
00:07:07,00:07:08,"to what we're talking about,"
00:07:08,00:07:12,which is humans trying to get squids in competition.
00:07:12,00:07:16,So there's an all-England squid championship that takes place.
00:07:16,00:07:20,- That's amazing. - That's an annual championship.
00:07:20,00:07:23,"So what this is, is there's 74 competitors that go out"
00:07:23,00:07:25,and they spend five hours hoping to catch
00:07:25,00:07:28,over 100 squids during the course of the day.
00:07:28,00:07:29,"- Five hours. - And then, yeah,"
00:07:29,00:07:30,they find the longest one.
00:07:30,00:07:35,"In 2012, it was won by a guy called David,"
00:07:35,00:07:37,who was a reigning champion.
00:07:37,00:07:38,He'd won the previous year.
00:07:38,00:07:41,"But in 2012, there was terrible weather conditions"
00:07:41,00:07:43,"and it was really, really rainy"
00:07:43,00:07:46,and no one was catching any squids.
00:07:46,00:07:48,"And he happened to notice, just before he was sending"
00:07:48,00:07:52,"his reel back out, that right on the tip of his little hook"
00:07:52,00:07:56,"was a tiny squid, a third of an inch long,"
00:07:56,00:07:58,and it was the only squid caught that year.
00:07:58,00:08:03,So the 2012 winner of the all-England squid championship
00:08:03,00:08:04,"was a third of an inch long. - You know what,"
00:08:04,00:08:07,I want to watch that documentary
00:08:07,00:08:10,and put it on Netflix called Squid Game 2.
00:08:10,00:08:13,- No one must have believed that squid
00:08:13,00:08:15,when it got back to its friends
00:08:15,00:08:18,"and said, ""Guys, I just won Squid of the year."""
00:08:18,00:08:19,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:08:19,00:08:22,- He would have got Seaman all over him
00:08:22,00:08:25,from every rich way with me.
00:08:25,00:08:27,"- Well, while we're on that."
00:08:27,00:08:29,"- Well, good."
00:08:29,00:08:31,And we were obviously going to be at some point.
00:08:31,00:08:32,"- At some point, at some point."
00:08:32,00:08:33,Let's get there now.
00:08:33,00:08:35,"- The northern pygmy squid, did you hear about this?"
00:08:35,00:08:36,"- Oh, yeah."
00:08:36,00:08:37,- So this is a squid where the female
00:08:37,00:08:40,"fertilizes her own eggs, okay?"
00:08:40,00:08:41,It's bizarre.
00:08:41,00:08:45,"So, as James said, the male kind of attaches the sperm"
00:08:45,00:08:46,to the body of the female.
00:08:46,00:08:49,"So it's not a kind of mating as we would understand it,"
00:08:49,00:08:50,but the sperm--
00:08:50,00:08:52,"- Yeah, so you would understand it maybe."
00:08:52,00:08:54,(audience laughing)
00:08:54,00:08:56,I like my sperm to spot it on my shoulder.
00:08:56,00:08:58,"And you know, I can dip in whenever I like."
00:08:58,00:08:59,- Well.
00:08:59,00:09:02,(audience laughing)
00:09:02,00:09:03,- I don't know.
00:09:03,00:09:04,Female choice.
00:09:04,00:09:06,(audience laughing)
00:09:06,00:09:09,"- I'm just going to cut that out, by the way."
00:09:09,00:09:12,"And when Dan goes, ""Fact number two, Anna Tyshinski,"""
00:09:12,00:09:13,"it'll just be like, ""My fact is,"
00:09:13,00:09:15,"I like Seaman on the back of my shoulder."""
00:09:15,00:09:19,(audience laughing)
00:09:19,00:09:20,- It's just less effort.
00:09:20,00:09:21,"Sorry, Andy."
00:09:21,00:09:22,"- No, no, no, no."
00:09:22,00:09:23,(audience laughing)
00:09:23,00:09:26,"- Well, you would fit in like a charm"
00:09:26,00:09:28,"into the northern pygmy squid society, Anna,"
00:09:28,00:09:30,"because the male attaches the sperm to the female,"
00:09:30,00:09:31,and then it goes through.
00:09:31,00:09:33,It sort of gets into her body somehow.
00:09:33,00:09:35,"I'm not exactly clear on the mechanism,"
00:09:35,00:09:38,but it gets into the female's mouth
00:09:38,00:09:40,when she's ready to inseminate.
00:09:40,00:09:43,And then she bites a hole in each of her eggs
00:09:43,00:09:47,"and just deposits a bit, squirts a bit of sperm,"
00:09:47,00:09:49,into each of the eggs to fertilize the eggs.
00:09:49,00:09:49,"- Oh, wow."
00:09:49,00:09:52,- So she is doing the fertilizing at that point.
00:09:52,00:09:52,Bizarre.
00:09:52,00:09:53,- That's very cool.
00:09:53,00:09:57,"That's like in Vecho, or it's like a test tube baby."
00:09:57,00:09:59,"- Kind of, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:09:59,00:10:00,- Those guys are pretty cool.
00:10:00,00:10:02,They have like a sticky patch on their back.
00:10:02,00:10:04,"And when they're kind of swimming around,"
00:10:04,00:10:05,"if they get tired,"
00:10:05,00:10:08,they can just stick themselves to a bit of seaweed.
00:10:08,00:10:09,- Wow. - And they just watch
00:10:09,00:10:10,things go past.
00:10:10,00:10:11,- That's great. - And then unstick themselves
00:10:11,00:10:12,and then swim around again.
00:10:12,00:10:14,"- That's so cool, so fun."
00:10:14,00:10:15,- And we say they don't play.
00:10:15,00:10:16,Come on.
00:10:16,00:10:17,- Yeah.
00:10:17,00:10:19,"- Did you guys ever do a fly wall when you were kids,"
00:10:19,00:10:21,where you would do a somersault against a Velcro wall?
00:10:21,00:10:22,That's just like that.
00:10:22,00:10:24,"- No, well, we didn't have a Velcro wall in our house,"
00:10:24,00:10:25,sadly.
00:10:25,00:10:26,(audience laughing)
00:10:26,00:10:28,- What wall did you keep your Velcro wall in?
00:10:28,00:10:30,- It was next to the bouncy castle drawing room.
00:10:30,00:10:33,(audience laughing)
00:10:33,00:10:36,"So on actually how they reproduce,"
00:10:36,00:10:37,there's this really interesting thing
00:10:37,00:10:38,"that they've recently discovered,"
00:10:38,00:10:40,which is it's about the egg mops.
00:10:40,00:10:41,"So I quite like this,"
00:10:41,00:10:44,"that when the female deposits all her fertilized eggs,"
00:10:44,00:10:45,"they're called mops,"
00:10:45,00:10:47,"and they're in these big piles,"
00:10:47,00:10:48,and she sticks them to the ground.
00:10:48,00:10:52,And then male squid are attracted to these.
00:10:52,00:10:53,"And that doesn't really make any sense,"
00:10:53,00:10:54,"because they've already been fertilized,"
00:10:54,00:10:56,so they're no use to the males.
00:10:56,00:10:58,But what it means is there are fertile females
00:10:58,00:10:59,"in the vicinity,"
00:10:59,00:11:01,'cause they tend to kind of hang out together.
00:11:01,00:11:02,"And not only this,"
00:11:02,00:11:03,"the male squid are attracted to the egg mops,"
00:11:03,00:11:05,"and then they come up to the egg mops,"
00:11:05,00:11:06,"and they kind of hug them,"
00:11:06,00:11:08,"very weird, and sort of stroke the eggs."
00:11:08,00:11:10,"And we didn't really know why they were doing this,"
00:11:10,00:11:12,"but it turns out that there's a chemical on the eggs,"
00:11:12,00:11:15,and as soon as the male squid sort of stroke
00:11:15,00:11:16,"and hug the eggs,"
00:11:16,00:11:18,"they get this chemical on their arms,"
00:11:18,00:11:21,and it turns them into like raging maniacs.
00:11:21,00:11:24,"So they go from being really chilled to being super aggro,"
00:11:24,00:11:26,"and this means that they fight other males in the vicinity,"
00:11:26,00:11:28,"and the woman's just back there,"
00:11:28,00:11:29,"the female's just back,"
00:11:29,00:11:30,"and the other way we're going, ""Okay, yeah."
00:11:30,00:11:33,"""All right, he's got some good biceps, I'll take him."""
00:11:33,00:11:36,"- And yet, yet, when I go and hug the children"
00:11:36,00:11:37,"at the local playground,"
00:11:37,00:11:40,"and then get into a fight with another bloke just outside it,"
00:11:40,00:11:42,I'm off to leave the park.
00:11:42,00:11:43,(laughing)
00:11:43,00:11:44,- Wow.
00:11:44,00:11:45,- It's a good trick.
00:11:45,00:11:47,"- It's amazing, that's amazing, that's so cool."
00:11:47,00:11:49,- Do you know a squid have won two Nobel Prizes?
00:11:49,00:11:50,- Have they?
00:11:50,00:11:51,- Yep.
00:11:51,00:11:52,"- No, they haven't."
00:11:52,00:11:53,"- Yes, they have. - Someone's won a Nobel Prize,"
00:11:53,00:11:55,"then it's been about them, the squid."
00:11:55,00:11:56,"- They don't play, they don't play"
00:11:56,00:11:57,"because they are all work,"
00:11:57,00:12:00,and they follow that work into the Nobel Prizes.
00:12:00,00:12:02,"- They did all the work, really,"
00:12:02,00:12:03,"the humans got the, you know,"
00:12:03,00:12:05,"the humans, Andrew Huxley and a few others"
00:12:05,00:12:08,"and Bernard Katz got the awards,"
00:12:08,00:12:10,"but basically it was from cutting up squids,"
00:12:10,00:12:12,so I think the squids deserve a bit of credit.
00:12:12,00:12:13,- Okay.
00:12:13,00:12:15,- And the reason is they have massive nerve fibres
00:12:15,00:12:16,"in their body, right?"
00:12:16,00:12:17,"Our nerves are really, really thin,"
00:12:17,00:12:19,"really tiny, you can hardly see them,"
00:12:19,00:12:23,"but in a squid, they're massive and you can see them,"
00:12:23,00:12:25,and originally they thought there were blood vessels
00:12:25,00:12:27,"that are so big, but that means that you can do loads"
00:12:27,00:12:30,"of stuff to these nerve fibres,"
00:12:30,00:12:33,and you can learn about how they move electricity
00:12:33,00:12:35,"from one place to another, you know,"
00:12:35,00:12:38,"you can see what's inside them and stuff like that,"
00:12:38,00:12:39,"and so people studied them,"
00:12:39,00:12:40,and they won Nobel Prizes for it.
00:12:40,00:12:41,- That's very cool.
00:12:41,00:12:42,"- Cool, nice."
00:12:42,00:12:43,- That is cool.
00:12:43,00:12:45,- I'm still giving the humans some credit for that.
00:12:45,00:12:45,"- Yeah, fair enough."
00:12:45,00:12:46,- 50/50.
00:12:46,00:12:48,- We need to move on to our next fact in a second.
00:12:48,00:12:49,"- Oh, no."
00:12:49,00:12:53,- I read an article on something called Mel Magazine Online.
00:12:53,00:12:55,"I think they were a bit short on ideas,"
00:12:55,00:12:57,"and they wanted to piggyback on Squid Game,"
00:12:57,00:12:59,so they asked a group of squid fishermen
00:12:59,00:13:01,who are in the squid game
00:13:01,00:13:04,if their job is anything like the TV show.
00:13:04,00:13:04,"- Oh, boy."
00:13:04,00:13:07,(laughing)
00:13:07,00:13:10,"- One of them said that in the show,"
00:13:10,00:13:12,"most people are looking out for themselves,"
00:13:12,00:13:15,"and that's very similar to squid fishermen,"
00:13:15,00:13:18,"because they have secrets about how to attract squid,"
00:13:18,00:13:21,and many of them will not share the knowledge
00:13:21,00:13:22,with other people.
00:13:22,00:13:23,"- Well, that does happen a bit in squid game."
00:13:23,00:13:24,- Exactly.
00:13:24,00:13:25,- Does it?
00:13:25,00:13:28,"- I mean, it's still a bottom of the barrel commission"
00:13:28,00:13:30,for this magazine.
00:13:30,00:13:31,"- Another person said,"
00:13:31,00:13:34,"""Squid fishing is actually really fun,"
00:13:34,00:13:36,"""and it's a family-oriented sport,"
00:13:36,00:13:38,"""so it's nothing like Squid Game."
00:13:38,00:13:41,"""The only asshole thing I do in squid ink"
00:13:41,00:13:43,"""is when I'm pulling up a squid,"
00:13:43,00:13:44,"""they tend to squirt out the ink"
00:13:44,00:13:46,"""as they come out of the water."
00:13:46,00:13:48,"""So if you aim that at the person next to you,"
00:13:48,00:13:50,"""they tend to get covered in ink."""
00:13:50,00:13:52,- Wow.
00:13:52,00:13:52,- But that's really fun.
00:13:52,00:13:54,They're their own little water pistols.
00:13:54,00:13:55,- Yeah.
00:13:55,00:13:55,- Cool.
00:13:55,00:13:57,"- Oh, I so want to know what the techniques are"
00:13:57,00:13:59,to lure a squid in.
00:13:59,00:14:00,"Like, do you put, like..."
00:14:00,00:14:03,"- Oh, you get little kind of..."
00:14:03,00:14:04,"The old Japanese way, what they would do is,"
00:14:04,00:14:07,"they'd have lures that look a little like baby squids,"
00:14:07,00:14:08,couldn't they?
00:14:08,00:14:10,"- But when they squirt the ink,"
00:14:10,00:14:13,it produces a thing which is roughly the size and shape
00:14:13,00:14:16,"of a squid, and it's called a pseudomorph."
00:14:16,00:14:18,So the predator is momentarily confused.
00:14:18,00:14:19,What am I going for?
00:14:19,00:14:21,Which of these two?
00:14:21,00:14:22,"- I don't know, it's very clever."
00:14:22,00:14:23,- It's like leaving a hole in the wall
00:14:23,00:14:24,that's the shape of you or something.
00:14:24,00:14:25,- Yes.
00:14:25,00:14:25,- As you run away.
00:14:25,00:14:26,- Yeah.
00:14:26,00:14:28,- Can I just say one thing about animals playing?
00:14:28,00:14:29,"- Yeah, sure."
00:14:29,00:14:31,- There's a woman called Linda Sharp who studies
00:14:31,00:14:33,"lots of different types of play in animals,"
00:14:33,00:14:36,"and says, basically, we all say we know why animals play,"
00:14:36,00:14:38,"social bonds, preparing for adult life,"
00:14:38,00:14:39,"but actually, we've got no idea."
00:14:39,00:14:41,It's probably just 'cause it's fun.
00:14:41,00:14:43,"And case in point, she said, she was watching some elephants,"
00:14:43,00:14:46,"and there was an elephant at the top of a slope,"
00:14:46,00:14:48,"and it saw another elephant, it's a muddy slope,"
00:14:48,00:14:50,"saw another elephant at the bottom of the slope,"
00:14:50,00:14:52,and it starts walking up towards this elephant
00:14:52,00:14:53,at the top of the slope.
00:14:53,00:14:55,"And when it's halfway up, the elephant at the top"
00:14:55,00:14:58,"gets on its bottom, like tucks its legs in,"
00:14:58,00:15:00,"and sort of toboggan's down the slope,"
00:15:00,00:15:02,"straight into the other elephant,"
00:15:02,00:15:04,"so it takes some bows out,"
00:15:04,00:15:06,"they roll down to the bottom of the hill,"
00:15:06,00:15:08,"they tumble around, have this big old fight,"
00:15:08,00:15:11,"and then eventually, she saw they've dusted themselves off,"
00:15:11,00:15:12,"and then they were like, okay,"
00:15:12,00:15:13,we'll climb up the slope now.
00:15:13,00:15:16,"They climbed up the slope, they got halfway up,"
00:15:16,00:15:17,"there's a third elephant at the top,"
00:15:17,00:15:18,you've seen it all.
00:15:18,00:15:19,(laughing)
00:15:19,00:15:20,- Exactly the same thing!
00:15:20,00:15:22,(laughing)
00:15:22,00:15:23,- That's amazing.
00:15:23,00:15:24,- That's awesome.
00:15:24,00:15:26,"- We need to move on to our next fact,"
00:15:26,00:15:30,"it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy."
00:15:30,00:15:35,"- My fact is that in 1935, New York issued a total ban"
00:15:35,00:15:39,on the possession or supply of baby artichokes.
00:15:39,00:15:40,(laughing)
00:15:40,00:15:45,"This was sent to me online, actually, by @Fodsox,"
00:15:45,00:15:47,"so thank you, Fodsox."
00:15:47,00:15:50,This is a fact about the '30s war
00:15:50,00:15:52,"against the baby artichoke,"
00:15:52,00:15:54,"or specifically, against the mafia"
00:15:54,00:15:57,"through the medium of the baby artichoke, so."
00:15:57,00:15:59,"- It was the main war of the '30s, wasn't it?"
00:15:59,00:15:59,The artichoke.
00:15:59,00:16:01,"- Yeah, it was the main war for most of the '30s,"
00:16:01,00:16:03,"and then there was a very strong late entrant,"
00:16:03,00:16:04,unfortunately.
00:16:04,00:16:05,(laughing)
00:16:05,00:16:06,"- I think in America, it was the main war"
00:16:06,00:16:07,for all of the '30s.
00:16:07,00:16:08,- That's a very good point.
00:16:08,00:16:10,- But are you giving the artichoke credit here
00:16:10,00:16:13,in the way that James is giving the squid a Nobel Prize?
00:16:13,00:16:14,"- No, I'm not giving the artichoke any credit."
00:16:14,00:16:16,"I'm giving the mayor of New York,"
00:16:16,00:16:19,"it was Fiorella LaGuardia,"
00:16:19,00:16:22,"so LaGuardia Airport, named after him."
00:16:22,00:16:23,"He was a big deal,"
00:16:23,00:16:26,"and in 1935, he walked into one of the biggest markets"
00:16:26,00:16:27,"in New York City,"
00:16:27,00:16:30,"and he announced baby artichokes, they're off the menu,"
00:16:30,00:16:32,"and it was gonna start the day after Christmas,"
00:16:32,00:16:33,"and he said, ""I like artichokes,"
00:16:33,00:16:35,"""particularly with Hollandaise sauce,"
00:16:35,00:16:37,"""but the ban will remain in force"
00:16:37,00:16:40,"""until the grip of the racketeers is broken."""
00:16:40,00:16:42,"And basically, it was because the mafia"
00:16:42,00:16:45,controlled the baby artichoke's supply
00:16:45,00:16:48,and made a load of money supplying New York
00:16:48,00:16:49,"with baby artichokes,"
00:16:49,00:16:51,and it was one of their major things.
00:16:51,00:16:55,"It was illegal alcohol, drugs, and then baby artichokes."
00:16:55,00:16:57,"- And they just forced the restaurants to buy them, didn't they,"
00:16:57,00:16:59,"and made them really, really expensive,"
00:16:59,00:17:01,"and cornered the market, and they're just like, yeah."
00:17:01,00:17:03,"- And they bought them at cheap prices, too."
00:17:03,00:17:05,"They squeezed the farmers at one end,"
00:17:05,00:17:06,and then they squeezed the restaurants at the other end.
00:17:06,00:17:08,A lot of squeezing. - Very clever.
00:17:08,00:17:09,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:17:09,00:17:11,- But didn't he lift the ban within a few days?
00:17:11,00:17:12,"- Oh, yeah."
00:17:12,00:17:14,"- 'Cause he was like, ""Actually, I really like artichokes."""
00:17:14,00:17:15,"- It wasn't 'cause you liked artichokes, no, they..."
00:17:15,00:17:18,"- Whoa, he beat them off you in three days?"
00:17:18,00:17:20,"- Yeah, because basically, there was this one guy,"
00:17:20,00:17:23,"a mafia boss, called Ciro Terenova,"
00:17:23,00:17:25,and he was known as the artichoke king.
00:17:25,00:17:27,- Ooh!
00:17:27,00:17:28,(laughter)
00:17:28,00:17:30,"- Well, the only thing I know about artichokes"
00:17:30,00:17:33,"is they make you fat, so I don't know."
00:17:33,00:17:35,"But anyway, so he was the one who was in charge of it,"
00:17:35,00:17:38,"and when LaGuardia said, ""You can't sell artichokes,"""
00:17:38,00:17:41,"then he had no one to sell his artichokes to,"
00:17:41,00:17:43,"and all the shops said, ""Okay, we're not gonna do it."
00:17:43,00:17:45,"""One or two people did carry on selling them,"
00:17:45,00:17:47,"""but they all got their licenses taken off them."""
00:17:47,00:17:48,- Right.
00:17:48,00:17:50,"- And then within three or four days,"
00:17:50,00:17:51,it was obvious that he wasn't gonna be able
00:17:51,00:17:53,to apply his words in New York anymore.
00:17:53,00:17:54,"- Okay, cool."
00:17:54,00:17:56,- It was a rapid turnaround.
00:17:56,00:17:57,"- Yeah, it was real quick."
00:17:57,00:17:58,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:17:58,00:17:59,- Most of them were coming in from California.
00:17:59,00:18:01,That's where they were all grown.
00:18:01,00:18:03,And there were stories that mafia agents
00:18:03,00:18:04,would go to California.
00:18:04,00:18:06,They would intimidate the growers of the farmers
00:18:06,00:18:08,into lowering their prices.
00:18:08,00:18:10,"They would even, this is reported at the time,"
00:18:10,00:18:11,"I don't think it's true,"
00:18:11,00:18:15,threatened aerial gas bombing of the farming fields.
00:18:15,00:18:17,"- I saw reports in the newspapers that that happened,"
00:18:17,00:18:19,"but again, it might not have been true."
00:18:19,00:18:21,"But the interesting thing was,"
00:18:21,00:18:23,"because that was happening in California,"
00:18:23,00:18:24,"and this guy was working,"
00:18:24,00:18:26,"the artichoke king was in New York,"
00:18:26,00:18:28,"suddenly it was in two states,"
00:18:28,00:18:30,"which meant it was a federal case,"
00:18:30,00:18:31,which meant that they could get
00:18:31,00:18:33,"all their federal people involved,"
00:18:33,00:18:35,which suddenly made it a really big deal.
00:18:35,00:18:36,"If it was just in New York,"
00:18:36,00:18:38,it would have been hard for him to do anything about it.
00:18:38,00:18:39,- Interesting.
00:18:39,00:18:41,- Do you remember we did a fact a very long time ago
00:18:41,00:18:43,about Marilyn Monroe being named artichoke queen?
00:18:43,00:18:44,- Oh yeah.
00:18:44,00:18:45,- Yeah.
00:18:45,00:18:47,There was a theory that the reason she was named that
00:18:47,00:18:51,was because they were trying to give a bit of sort of gloss
00:18:51,00:18:54,back to an industry completely dominated by the mafia.
00:18:54,00:18:55,- I thought you were going to say this
00:18:55,00:18:57,because she was married to the artichoke king.
00:18:57,00:18:58,(laughing)
00:18:58,00:18:59,- Okay.
00:18:59,00:19:01,"- They ruled, they ruled the artichokes."
00:19:01,00:19:01,- Yeah.
00:19:01,00:19:04,- I just realized artichoke king sounds like something
00:19:04,00:19:06,"that a mafia boss would do to you, doesn't it?"
00:19:06,00:19:06,- Yes.
00:19:06,00:19:07,- Oh yeah.
00:19:07,00:19:09,- Subject someone to a real artichoke king.
00:19:09,00:19:10,(laughing)
00:19:10,00:19:13,By stuffing those weird white from things
00:19:13,00:19:15,"in the artichoke down your throat, that's how you do it."
00:19:15,00:19:17,You'd make them eat that middle white bit.
00:19:17,00:19:19,"- I know, you are terrified."
00:19:19,00:19:20,(laughing)
00:19:20,00:19:22,"- I just, I'm frightened of artichokes."
00:19:22,00:19:25,- The sperm shoulder bandits tried again last night.
00:19:25,00:19:28,(laughing)
00:19:28,00:19:30,- And it was just baby artichokes then.
00:19:30,00:19:31,"It's very specific, isn't it?"
00:19:31,00:19:32,"- Yes, only baby artichokes."
00:19:32,00:19:33,- 'Cause they're quite similar.
00:19:33,00:19:34,The mafia could have branched out
00:19:34,00:19:35,"into just the slightly bigger ones,"
00:19:35,00:19:37,"but they didn't think of that, I guess."
00:19:37,00:19:38,Not so smart.
00:19:38,00:19:39,- Yeah.
00:19:39,00:19:41,I think actually the only difference
00:19:41,00:19:43,is that baby artichokes don't even have the chokey bit.
00:19:43,00:19:45,They don't have the annoying fuzzy bit
00:19:45,00:19:47,"that I don't like, right?"
00:19:47,00:19:49,And they're not even younger.
00:19:49,00:19:50,It's a real misnomer.
00:19:50,00:19:53,They just grow lower down on the artichoke plant.
00:19:53,00:19:54,"So I think they're from the same plant,"
00:19:54,00:19:55,"but they don't get as much sunshine,"
00:19:55,00:19:57,so they don't grow to be as big.
00:19:57,00:19:59,"And yeah, they're just more tender and nice."
00:19:59,00:20:01,- Is that like how baby carrots
00:20:01,00:20:03,are not really a different kind of thing?
00:20:03,00:20:04,They're just.
00:20:04,00:20:05,"- I think they're just chopped up carrots, aren't they?"
00:20:05,00:20:06,"- Yeah, I think they might be."
00:20:06,00:20:08,"But I've never been confident enough to say,"
00:20:08,00:20:10,"""And I really regret bringing it up now."""
00:20:10,00:20:11,(audience laughing)
00:20:11,00:20:13,- At least there's not a thousand people in York
00:20:13,00:20:14,looking at you when you're saying that.
00:20:14,00:20:16,- It's like an anxiety dream.
00:20:16,00:20:18,- That's like Jerusalem artichokes as well.
00:20:18,00:20:18,- Sorry?
00:20:18,00:20:19,- Jerusalem artichokes.
00:20:19,00:20:20,"- Oh, yeah."
00:20:20,00:20:22,"- Not from Jerusalem, not artichokes."
00:20:22,00:20:23,- Not even any kind of artichoke.
00:20:23,00:20:24,- What the fuck is going on?
00:20:24,00:20:25,- Yeah.
00:20:25,00:20:26,(audience laughing)
00:20:26,00:20:28,- The guy who first found them
00:20:28,00:20:30,"decided they tasted a bit like artichokes,"
00:20:30,00:20:31,"so they must be artichokes, I think."
00:20:31,00:20:32,- Okay.
00:20:32,00:20:33,- Yeah.
00:20:33,00:20:35,- Don't know where the Jerusalem bit came from.
00:20:35,00:20:37,"- Well, I love the Jerusalem bit."
00:20:37,00:20:38,This is one of my favorite etymologies.
00:20:38,00:20:40,"This is because, so they look like sunflowers,"
00:20:40,00:20:41,"Jerusalem artichokes,"
00:20:41,00:20:43,"obviously not the gross tube a bit,"
00:20:43,00:20:45,"but the bit that grows out of them,"
00:20:45,00:20:46,"look like sunflowers,"
00:20:46,00:20:49,and Europeans discovered them in the 1600s.
00:20:49,00:20:51,"There was a French explorer,"
00:20:51,00:20:53,"and brought them back, brought them back to Europe,"
00:20:53,00:20:54,"and they got to Italy,"
00:20:54,00:20:56,"and they were called girassole,"
00:20:56,00:21:00,"as in sunflower, as turns round with the sun."
00:21:00,00:21:02,"So the word for sunflower in Italian,"
00:21:02,00:21:06,and girassole gradually turned into Jerusalem.
00:21:06,00:21:07,- Very good.
00:21:07,00:21:08,- That's cool.
00:21:08,00:21:09,- Ooh.
00:21:09,00:21:09,- I like it.
00:21:09,00:21:10,- Yeah.
00:21:10,00:21:12,"- Do you know that the Italian word for mafia,"
00:21:12,00:21:16,"or for a mafia clan, is cosciosca, or sosca,"
00:21:16,00:21:19,and that means artichoke heart?
00:21:19,00:21:20,"- No way, yeah."
00:21:20,00:21:23,"- Interesting, is it 'cause they're tightly bound together?"
00:21:23,00:21:24,- He's only gone and got it.
00:21:24,00:21:26,"- Yeah, that's exactly right."
00:21:26,00:21:26,- They have to.
00:21:26,00:21:28,"- So the artichoke leaves are all really close together,"
00:21:28,00:21:30,and that's what the mafia clan is like.
00:21:30,00:21:31,- They can't be separated.
00:21:31,00:21:32,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:21:32,00:21:33,- Wow.
00:21:33,00:21:34,- That's cool.
00:21:34,00:21:35,- Very difficult to eat.
00:21:35,00:21:36,- Do you know how--
00:21:36,00:21:38,(laughing)
00:21:38,00:21:40,- But it can be done.
00:21:40,00:21:41,- Can be done.
00:21:41,00:21:44,Do you know how we got the artichoke in the first place?
00:21:44,00:21:45,"- No, just grew it?"
00:21:45,00:21:47,"- Well, it's from, no."
00:21:47,00:21:48,"Actually, we didn't know this."
00:21:48,00:21:50,- Waitrose?
00:21:50,00:21:52,"- No, it's a couple of thousand years old."
00:21:52,00:21:55,"It dates back to ancient Greece, the artichoke."
00:21:55,00:21:59,"And it comes from a time when the Greek god, Zeus,"
00:21:59,00:22:02,"fancied a woman called Kinara, or Sinara,"
00:22:02,00:22:04,and he installed her in heaven as his kind of mistress.
00:22:04,00:22:07,But then she kept on sneaking back to the mortal plane
00:22:07,00:22:09,"to see her family, and Zeus found out about this,"
00:22:09,00:22:12,and he got really annoyed and turned her into an artichoke.
00:22:12,00:22:14,"- Ah, and that's how we have artichokes."
00:22:14,00:22:15,- And that's how we have them.
00:22:15,00:22:16,- Yeah. - Okay.
00:22:16,00:22:18,"- Well, I actually believe James' version"
00:22:18,00:22:19,about us just growing them.
00:22:19,00:22:21,(laughing)
00:22:21,00:22:23,"- You choose what you wanna believe, yeah."
00:22:23,00:22:25,"- Just very quickly back to the mafia,"
00:22:25,00:22:28,"I was very surprised to discover that they,"
00:22:28,00:22:30,"they're just involved in so many different rackets,"
00:22:30,00:22:31,aren't they?
00:22:31,00:22:34,"And in 2014-ish, they started getting"
00:22:34,00:22:37,"into wind farms, so they went green."
00:22:37,00:22:39,"- Oh, they're very ethical, always open."
00:22:39,00:22:42,"- Yeah, so they're known as the eco-mafia,"
00:22:42,00:22:45,"and in Sicily, wind farms are a massive deal there now,"
00:22:45,00:22:46,and the money that is being generated
00:22:46,00:22:50,from selling all of the power across Europe
00:22:50,00:22:52,is such big money that that's their thing.
00:22:52,00:22:54,"So, yeah, it's just such a bizarre-"
00:22:54,00:22:56,- As far as those big blades
00:22:56,00:22:57,"can cut off the horse's head, it's crazy."
00:22:57,00:23:01,(laughing)
00:23:01,00:23:03,"- They're also into organic food as well,"
00:23:03,00:23:05,"the mafia at the moment, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:23:05,00:23:07,- They're such hipsters these days.
00:23:07,00:23:08,(laughing)
00:23:08,00:23:12,"- Well, I say that, they're into getting cheap food"
00:23:12,00:23:15,"from Eastern Europe, and then relabeling it as organic,"
00:23:15,00:23:16,"and then selling it, oh."
00:23:16,00:23:18,"- Oh, I see, yeah."
00:23:18,00:23:19,"- Okay, yeah."
00:23:19,00:23:23,"- I was shocked, shocked, as someone who lives"
00:23:23,00:23:26,in East London at the level of contamination
00:23:26,00:23:29,of what claims to be organic food by the mafia.
00:23:29,00:23:30,"- So, believe you me, if you think you've got"
00:23:30,00:23:34,"extra virgin olive oil at home, you probably haven't."
00:23:34,00:23:37,"This is, they're adulterating all this stuff,"
00:23:37,00:23:40,"and actually in Italy, the police employ special tasters"
00:23:40,00:23:43,who are specifically trained to spot fraudulent food
00:23:43,00:23:45,to taste lots of types of olive oil.
00:23:45,00:23:47,"- Well, do you eat a sweet gig for the police to have?"
00:23:47,00:23:49,"- Yeah, I know."
00:23:49,00:23:52,"They do things like, they whiten mozzarella with detergent,"
00:23:52,00:23:55,"they make bread with asbestos, and--"
00:23:55,00:23:58,"- Okay, is it getting less sweet as a gig,"
00:23:58,00:23:59,as you say this?
00:23:59,00:24:01,- Yeah. - Wow.
00:24:01,00:24:04,"- But extra virgin olive oil, adulteration of that"
00:24:04,00:24:07,"is the biggest sort of agricultural fraud in the world,"
00:24:07,00:24:11,"and 60% of extra virgin olive oil that's sold is not that,"
00:24:11,00:24:12,is not extra virgin.
00:24:12,00:24:14,"- Wow, so what is it?"
00:24:14,00:24:16,- Just straight up shit oil.
00:24:16,00:24:17,"- Oh, right."
00:24:17,00:24:20,- It's just adulterated with less good quality oil.
00:24:20,00:24:22,"It's not urine or anything, you'll be fine,"
00:24:22,00:24:24,"you won't notice the difference,"
00:24:24,00:24:27,but you're being bamboozled.
00:24:27,00:24:29,"- Okay, that sounds fine."
00:24:29,00:24:30,(laughing)
00:24:30,00:24:34,- And that's the spirit which broke the mafia year in 1935.
00:24:34,00:24:35,- I'm just a bit worried that we're giving the mafia
00:24:35,00:24:37,"a lot of shit in this podcast,"
00:24:37,00:24:39,and I kind of want to distance myself a tiny bit.
00:24:39,00:24:40,(laughing)
00:24:40,00:24:41,"- Oh, wow."
00:24:41,00:24:42,- You keep giving me that shit oil.
00:24:42,00:24:43,- I'm fine.
00:24:43,00:24:47,"- My family, Mike Living, thank you."
00:24:47,00:24:48,(laughing)
00:24:48,00:24:49,"- Bring it on, lads."
00:24:49,00:24:52,"Come on, let's be out of here."
00:24:52,00:24:54,(laughing)
00:24:54,00:24:56,"- This is an extra virgin over here,"
00:24:56,00:24:58,and you're not getting any of that.
00:24:58,00:25:00,(laughing)
00:25:00,00:25:07,"It is time for fact number three, and that is Anna."
00:25:07,00:25:09,"- My fact this week is that until recently,"
00:25:09,00:25:11,"in the Chinese city of Chongqing,"
00:25:11,00:25:15,you could hail down a stickman to carry your bags
00:25:15,00:25:17,"by shouting, ""Bankman!"""
00:25:17,00:25:21,"Which is a fun idea, and a mysterious fact"
00:25:21,00:25:22,to say without explaining it.
00:25:22,00:25:24,So I almost want to just leave it at that.
00:25:24,00:25:25,(laughing)
00:25:25,00:25:26,- What do you mean by stickman?
00:25:26,00:25:29,"It's like someone, like one of those people"
00:25:29,00:25:31,"that tells you where the gents toilets are, or?"
00:25:31,00:25:32,(laughing)
00:25:32,00:25:34,"- That's not, they don't tell you where the toilets are."
00:25:34,00:25:35,- They do.
00:25:35,00:25:36,- They indicate where it is.
00:25:36,00:25:37,"- I think by the time you're seeing the stickman,"
00:25:37,00:25:38,"you've found the toilet, James."
00:25:38,00:25:40,"- Yeah, I'm the one on the door."
00:25:40,00:25:41,I'm over here!
00:25:41,00:25:42,(laughing)
00:25:42,00:25:43,Quick!
00:25:43,00:25:44,(laughing)
00:25:44,00:25:44,Free me!
00:25:44,00:25:47,"- There's a stole for you, quick!"
00:25:47,00:25:47,(laughing)
00:25:47,00:25:48,"Oh no, don't go in,"
00:25:48,00:25:50,there's a guy having a massive shit stand!
00:25:50,00:25:51,(laughing)
00:25:51,00:25:54,- It's not one of the toilet warning signs.
00:25:54,00:25:59,"It's, so these are then called, it's actually bang bang."
00:25:59,00:26:01,"But we discussed this,"
00:26:01,00:26:02,and we decided if you shouted bang bang
00:26:02,00:26:04,"as an ignorant English person,"
00:26:04,00:26:06,then they'd probably know what you meant.
00:26:06,00:26:08,And it's the name for these stickmen.
00:26:08,00:26:10,"So they're people who carry sticks around,"
00:26:10,00:26:13,and they're extremely populous
00:26:13,00:26:16,in like up until the early 2000s really in Chongqing.
00:26:16,00:26:17,And they're porters.
00:26:17,00:26:19,And the reason that they remained in that city
00:26:19,00:26:22,"is because the terrain is very hilly,"
00:26:22,00:26:24,"it's lots and lots of winding alleyways,"
00:26:24,00:26:26,"and lots of steps connecting one place to the other,"
00:26:26,00:26:28,"and you can't really get a car or anything around,"
00:26:28,00:26:30,it's even hard to get a bike around it.
00:26:30,00:26:32,"And so all you can do is,"
00:26:32,00:26:34,"you can say I've got 17 heavy suitcases,"
00:26:34,00:26:36,and here's a small guy with a stick.
00:26:36,00:26:37,Can he carry them all please?
00:26:37,00:26:39,"And they do it, it's unbelievable,"
00:26:39,00:26:40,the loads that they carry.
00:26:40,00:26:42,- There's not as many these days as though
00:26:42,00:26:44,"they're kind of going out, business a little bit."
00:26:44,00:26:46,"Yeah, there was a documentary quite recently"
00:26:46,00:26:49,"called The Last Generation of Bang Bang,"
00:26:49,00:26:51,which was explaining that kind of these people
00:26:51,00:26:53,"have got other jobs now, like delivery people,"
00:26:53,00:26:56,"like I don't know, delivery or that kind of thing."
00:26:56,00:26:58,"Whatever the Chinese equivalent is,"
00:26:58,00:27:00,that's a lot of people do that.
00:27:00,00:27:01,"But they were really popular,"
00:27:01,00:27:04,"there was a soap opera called Mountain City Bang Bang Men,"
00:27:04,00:27:05,which was all about them.
00:27:05,00:27:06,- Really?
00:27:06,00:27:07,"- And there's also a drinking game,"
00:27:07,00:27:09,"if you're a student in Chongqing,"
00:27:09,00:27:11,then you might play this game.
00:27:11,00:27:12,"And the drinking game is basically,"
00:27:12,00:27:14,"whenever you see one of these guys, you drink."
00:27:14,00:27:15,"- Oh, right."
00:27:15,00:27:16,- Wow.
00:27:16,00:27:17,"- Wow, that was a game."
00:27:17,00:27:19,"- Oh no, people are so much more sober now."
00:27:19,00:27:20,"- Yes, they are."
00:27:20,00:27:23,"So Chongqing has, it's got a huge population,"
00:27:23,00:27:25,it's like 32 million at the time
00:27:25,00:27:28,"where they were sort of at the peak before the decline,"
00:27:28,00:27:31,"there's about 30,000 stickmen that were in operation."
00:27:31,00:27:34,"But I was reading Chongqing, in my head,"
00:27:34,00:27:36,"I was like, I know this place, how do I know this place?"
00:27:36,00:27:40,"And it's because it has my favorite rail station,"
00:27:40,00:27:43,"in so a metro station, a train station in Chongqing,"
00:27:43,00:27:46,"which is, they have them very high up,"
00:27:46,00:27:48,kind of like monorails that go round through the city.
00:27:48,00:27:51,And one particular path that it needed to take
00:27:51,00:27:53,was gonna be in the exact spot
00:27:53,00:27:55,"where they were building a residential building,"
00:27:55,00:27:56,which was 19 floors high.
00:27:56,00:27:57,"- Oh, is that that?"
00:27:57,00:27:59,"- Yeah, so between floors six, I believe,"
00:27:59,00:28:03,"and floors nine, I think those are the right ones,"
00:28:03,00:28:05,"they're suddenly in a residential building,"
00:28:05,00:28:07,"a train that just goes through the building,"
00:28:07,00:28:09,stops in the building as well.
00:28:09,00:28:10,- Wow.
00:28:10,00:28:12,"- Yeah, so it's in stop in the building,"
00:28:12,00:28:15,and they had to soundproof all of the apartments
00:28:15,00:28:16,to make sure that all the noise
00:28:16,00:28:18,wouldn't get to them too much.
00:28:18,00:28:19,"- Oh, my God."
00:28:19,00:28:21,"- Yeah, how cool is that, that's from Chongqing."
00:28:21,00:28:22,- That's incredible.
00:28:22,00:28:22,- Yeah.
00:28:22,00:28:26,- I'm just sort of carrying extremely heavy weights.
00:28:26,00:28:28,"It is kind of unbelievable, so there are lots of people,"
00:28:28,00:28:31,"particularly people who are mountain porters,"
00:28:31,00:28:34,"so this is, you know, very high altitude environments,"
00:28:34,00:28:36,can carry unbelievably heavy weights.
00:28:36,00:28:39,"So they studied mountain porters in Nepal,"
00:28:39,00:28:41,"there was a scientist from Belgium called Norman Haglund,"
00:28:41,00:28:43,"and he was a muscle physiologist,"
00:28:43,00:28:45,"and he thought, I've got to know what is different,"
00:28:45,00:28:47,like what is different physically
00:28:47,00:28:49,"about Nepalese mountain porters,"
00:28:49,00:28:51,"'cause they, on average, the guys he studied"
00:28:51,00:28:56,"weighed about 56 kilos, but they can carry 68 kilos."
00:28:56,00:28:58,"They can carry more than their own body weight,"
00:28:58,00:29:01,"and they're carrying it uphill, steep uphill,"
00:29:01,00:29:03,"and he studied them, and he found nothing different"
00:29:03,00:29:05,"physically about them, except that they're just"
00:29:05,00:29:08,"extremely tough, that's the only thing he found."
00:29:08,00:29:11,"They, on average, they can carry 90% of their body weight."
00:29:11,00:29:15,The heaviest load he found was 175% of the guy's weight
00:29:15,00:29:16,that he was carrying. - That's really cool.
00:29:16,00:29:19,"- And by comparison, physically fit Westerners,"
00:29:19,00:29:20,"you know, backpacking or whatever,"
00:29:20,00:29:24,"you can do about 25% of your weight for a couple of days,"
00:29:24,00:29:26,"and then it really, really hurts,"
00:29:26,00:29:28,and these guys have just done so much of it.
00:29:28,00:29:30,"- Yeah, but the other thing that he said that he noticed"
00:29:30,00:29:32,is that they're incredibly slow.
00:29:32,00:29:35,"They just keep to a pace, and so, for example,"
00:29:35,00:29:37,if they were going to a Saturday market
00:29:37,00:29:39,"and they were running late,"
00:29:39,00:29:41,"they would get up late before, you know,"
00:29:41,00:29:44,"early in the morning, and they would just rather walk there"
00:29:44,00:29:48,"at their super slow pace, rather than in any way be fast."
00:29:48,00:29:50,"- Oh, really? - They'll go through the night."
00:29:50,00:29:51,"- Yeah, they'll go through the night,"
00:29:51,00:29:52,like fast is just not an option for them.
00:29:52,00:29:54,"They'll just, they pace themselves."
00:29:54,00:29:56,"- But basically, the lesson seemed to be,"
00:29:56,00:29:58,we're really pathetic in the West.
00:29:58,00:29:59,"I mean, that was his conclusion, wasn't it?"
00:29:59,00:30:02,"He was like, well, it turns out there's not a special gate"
00:30:02,00:30:04,that they have that's really great.
00:30:04,00:30:06,They're not actually using oxygen much more efficiently.
00:30:06,00:30:08,We can just actually carry way more than 25%.
00:30:08,00:30:11,"So next time you're off to help someone with their bags,"
00:30:11,00:30:13,"think twice, okay?"
00:30:13,00:30:16,'Cause we should be carrying this amount as well.
00:30:16,00:30:18,- There are some people in Europe who do this as well.
00:30:18,00:30:22,"So in Slovakia, in the Tattris Mountains,"
00:30:22,00:30:24,"there are a load of hostels that are really high up,"
00:30:24,00:30:26,"but there are no roads that get there,"
00:30:26,00:30:28,and so they have to take everything up there.
00:30:28,00:30:31,"So they'll take, if they need a refrigerator up there,"
00:30:31,00:30:34,they'll strap it to the back and just walk up.
00:30:34,00:30:36,"If there's a microwave, they'll strap it to the back"
00:30:36,00:30:37,and just walk up.
00:30:37,00:30:40,"And the record, the amount that the strongest person"
00:30:40,00:30:43,"that's ever taken up to these hostels in Slovakia,"
00:30:43,00:30:46,"it was going to the Lako Kalunga Castle Hotel,"
00:30:46,00:30:51,and this guy carried 207 kilograms on his back to this place.
00:30:51,00:30:52,"And that, if you don't know what that is,"
00:30:52,00:30:55,"that's the equivalent to carrying a red deer,"
00:30:55,00:30:59,"an upright piano, or all of Little Mix."
00:30:59,00:31:00,- Wow. - Whoa!
00:31:00,00:31:03,- Wow. - Jesus.
00:31:03,00:31:06,- That's really put Little Mix into context for me.
00:31:07,00:31:09,- We've all learned something from that comparison.
00:31:09,00:31:12,"- All of Little Mix, we're the same as one red deer."
00:31:12,00:31:14,- I reckon. - Either red deer are a lot bigger
00:31:14,00:31:16,"than I thought, or Little Mix are a lot smaller."
00:31:16,00:31:19,"- The clue's in the name, the Little Mix, obviously."
00:31:19,00:31:22,"- Which Little Mix, because there were four, but now there's three."
00:31:22,00:31:24,"- It's the four. - The four, okay."
00:31:24,00:31:29,- It's context. - Which sugar babes line up
00:31:29,00:31:32,could he possibly have taken?
00:31:32,00:31:34,"- I was reading about porters, generally,"
00:31:34,00:31:37,and just seeing what roles they've played in history.
00:31:37,00:31:41,"And I found a really fun thing, which is in 1930,"
00:31:41,00:31:43,a porter carrying some luggage
00:31:43,00:31:45,led to the creation of the Association
00:31:45,00:31:48,for Mutual Help of the French Nobility.
00:31:48,00:31:50,And this was two--
00:31:50,00:31:53,"- It's a bit late for them, I think, by then, isn't it?"
00:31:53,00:31:55,Because I've been with that 150 years earlier.
00:31:55,00:31:56,"- This is the thing, right?"
00:31:56,00:31:59,It's basically looking after all the noble people
00:31:59,00:32:00,who fell from grace.
00:32:00,00:32:02,"So two people were walking along,"
00:32:02,00:32:03,"they were having their luggage carried,"
00:32:03,00:32:06,and they suddenly noticed the person carrying the luggage
00:32:06,00:32:08,was someone of noble stock.
00:32:08,00:32:10,"And they thought, hang on a second, what's going on?"
00:32:10,00:32:11,Why are you doing this menial job
00:32:11,00:32:17,when you should be glorified in your family's right to be great?
00:32:17,00:32:19,"And they said, we need to give you some money."
00:32:19,00:32:22,"And they thought, what if this is happening elsewhere in France?"
00:32:22,00:32:24,"And so they set up this association,"
00:32:24,00:32:26,"and people can still, to this day, apply for--"
00:32:26,00:32:29,"Yeah, please send my kid to a good school"
00:32:29,00:32:31,"because we don't have enough money,"
00:32:31,00:32:33,"but we're from noble background, look at our surname."
00:32:33,00:32:35,- No. - And they bust a bunch of French people.
00:32:35,00:32:37,"You know what, if you're going to give some money to charity,"
00:32:37,00:32:40,perhaps there are a few others other than the posh friend.
00:32:40,00:32:45,"- No, absolutely not. I'm changing all my direct habits right now."
00:32:45,00:32:48,- This is on-- they need another revolution.
00:32:48,00:32:50,Did they learn nothing?
00:32:50,00:32:52,- I wonder now how they noticed
00:32:52,00:32:55,that the guy carrying the bags was of noble stock.
00:32:55,00:32:56,That's the big question for me.
00:32:56,00:32:58,"Like, did he have a birthmark?"
00:32:58,00:33:00,"- He was bleeding, his hands were bleeding"
00:33:00,00:33:02,"because of the blisters, and I guess the blue blood,"
00:33:02,00:33:04,"does that give it away, maybe?"
00:33:04,00:33:06,- But what was it? What do we know what it was?
00:33:06,00:33:08,"- They just recognised maybe it was his manner,"
00:33:08,00:33:10,"maybe it could have been an old friend from school, I don't know."
00:33:10,00:33:12,"- I bet he was just like, ""Do you know,"
00:33:12,00:33:16,"""my great-uncle was the Baron of Orly."""
00:33:16,00:33:18,- Wow. - Wow.
00:33:18,00:33:20,- This is about carrying heavyweights.
00:33:20,00:33:22,"It's not actually about humans carrying heavyweights,"
00:33:22,00:33:25,"but some dung beetles, which are called onthophagous taurus,"
00:33:25,00:33:28,"they can pull 1100 times their own weight,"
00:33:28,00:33:30,"which is very impressive,"
00:33:30,00:33:33,and it's entirely evolved because of their sex life.
00:33:33,00:33:37,"- Interesting, because I assume that all they're carrying is dung."
00:33:37,00:33:40,"- Well, dung is big, relative to them."
00:33:40,00:33:42,"- Oh, yeah, I'm not saying it."
00:33:42,00:33:45,"- But in fact, you're right, sorry, it's not because of the dung moving."
00:33:45,00:33:48,So the females will dig a tunnel under a cowpat.
00:33:48,00:33:51,That's where they create this kind of tunnel of love
00:33:51,00:33:53,where they're getting ready to mate.
00:33:53,00:33:56,- It certainly sounds like a sexy tunnel.
00:33:56,00:33:58,"- For the dung beetle, unbelievably sexy."
00:33:58,00:34:01,"And basically, so the female goes into the tunnel and waits,"
00:34:01,00:34:04,"and then a male will go into the tunnel, right, to mate."
00:34:04,00:34:06,But sometimes a male will get into the tunnel
00:34:06,00:34:08,"and find there's a rival male already there,"
00:34:08,00:34:11,and they have evolved this unbelievably strong movement
00:34:11,00:34:14,"where they fight, they tussle, and they lock horns,"
00:34:14,00:34:17,and they try and try and try to pull each other out
00:34:17,00:34:19,or push each other out of the tunnel.
00:34:19,00:34:21,"So as a result, they've evolved the ability to move"
00:34:21,00:34:23,a thousand times their own weight.
00:34:23,00:34:26,"However, there are some males which are not like that."
00:34:26,00:34:28,"They're sneaky males, they're not strong,"
00:34:28,00:34:30,"but they are fast walkers,"
00:34:30,00:34:32,and they have extremely dense testicles.
00:34:32,00:34:34,And they...
00:34:34,00:34:39,Fast walkers with extremely dense testicles.
00:34:39,00:34:41,What does that mean? - What does that mean?
00:34:41,00:34:45,Because you think that is slowing down.
00:34:45,00:34:50,"Yeah, but it could be the momentum can pull you forward sometimes."
00:34:50,00:34:52,"You know, like, when you walk,"
00:34:52,00:34:54,"and you kind of move your arms back and forward,"
00:34:54,00:34:56,and you could swing your testicles as you walk.
00:34:56,00:34:59,"Yeah, standing long jump, you preponder so forward, yeah."
00:34:59,00:35:01,"Anyway, so they sneak into the tunnels, attempt a shag,"
00:35:01,00:35:03,attempt to get out quickly.
00:35:03,00:35:05,So that just... The woman turns out she prefers
00:35:05,00:35:07,to dense testicles to the extremely strong ones.
00:35:07,00:35:09,Is that the idea? How are they winning?
00:35:09,00:35:11,It's not clear what criteria she's applying.
00:35:11,00:35:13,"I think if there's a male there, she'll mate with it."
00:35:13,00:35:15,I've not got my head around the dense testicle thing.
00:35:15,00:35:17,"What is that doing? Like, what is it?"
00:35:17,00:35:19,"Well, they've just got..."
00:35:19,00:35:21,"It just means they're producing a lot of sperm,"
00:35:21,00:35:23,"and they can quickly get in, mate, and get out."
00:35:23,00:35:26,And they're putting all of their resources into sperm quality
00:35:26,00:35:28,rather than into physical power.
00:35:28,00:35:31,But how do you tell someone that your sperm quality is great?
00:35:31,00:35:33,"I don't think they're communicating on this level, but we're..."
00:35:33,00:35:35,Right.
00:35:35,00:35:37,"If there's a male there, the female will mate with it,"
00:35:37,00:35:39,and he turns up and says...
00:35:39,00:35:41,"It gets in there. There's no flirting, I think."
00:35:41,00:35:43,It's a bit like... You're in a tunnel under a cowpat.
00:35:43,00:35:45,I think the romance is pretty dead.
00:35:45,00:35:47,LAUGHTER
00:35:50,00:35:54,"I was looking at other jobs that you could describe as being like porters,"
00:35:54,00:35:57,and I was thinking one of my favourite things that I read a while back
00:35:57,00:36:00,is that Scottish fishermen's wives
00:36:00,00:36:03,were basically porters of their husbands.
00:36:03,00:36:05,So this is...
00:36:05,00:36:08,"In the 19th century, the herring industry was massive in Scotland."
00:36:08,00:36:11,"Everyone was a herring farmer, herring fisherman."
00:36:11,00:36:15,"And the fishermen, when they went to get in their boats,"
00:36:15,00:36:17,they would usually have sea...
00:36:17,00:36:19,"They would go from a beach,"
00:36:19,00:36:21,"so they'd go off from a beach, get in a boat,"
00:36:21,00:36:24,"and they don't want to get wet because they're going to be out all day,"
00:36:24,00:36:26,and it's fucking cold in Scotland.
00:36:26,00:36:29,And so the wives would always carry their husbands into the boat.
00:36:29,00:36:31,So you'll see their old photos of these husbands
00:36:31,00:36:33,"with all their fishing tackle in their arms,"
00:36:33,00:36:35,and their wives just carrying them like a baby
00:36:35,00:36:37,"and plopping them into that little boat,"
00:36:37,00:36:39,waving them off for the packed lunch.
00:36:39,00:36:41,That's amazing.
00:36:41,00:36:46,The man who has carried the heaviest load for 10 metres in history
00:36:46,00:36:48,"was a guy called Patrick Bobonian,"
00:36:48,00:36:51,"and at the end of walking the 10 metres, he shouted out,"
00:36:51,00:36:53,"""Vegan power!"""
00:36:53,00:36:55,Nice. Yeah.
00:36:55,00:36:58,And he was trying to prove that you can still be strong
00:36:58,00:37:00,and have a vegan diet.
00:37:00,00:37:02,"They interviewed him afterwards and said,"
00:37:02,00:37:05,"""It was a bit of a stupid thing to do, and it really hurt."""
00:37:05,00:37:10,If only I'd had a sausage sandwich before I said no.
00:37:10,00:37:13,"Time for our final fact, and that is my fact."
00:37:13,00:37:16,"My fact this week is that in 1994,"
00:37:16,00:37:21,"the music group, the KLF, burnt one million pounds."
00:37:21,00:37:26,"27 years later, they're still not sure why they did it"
00:37:26,00:37:28,"and have even toured the UK,"
00:37:28,00:37:32,asking audiences if they have any idea why they did it.
00:37:32,00:37:38,So this was a very famous moment in '90s music.
00:37:38,00:37:40,KLF were a massive band.
00:37:40,00:37:42,Justified and Ancient was a huge...
00:37:42,00:37:45,"They were huge. Their singles were massive selling,"
00:37:45,00:37:49,"but they were very artistic and they were very anti the industry,"
00:37:49,00:37:52,and they decided that they were going to absolutely
00:37:52,00:37:55,whiten themselves out in a way that a band has never done before.
00:37:55,00:37:58,They were going to take all their music away from catalogs
00:37:58,00:38:00,that were publishing it.
00:38:00,00:38:02,"They were going to remove it from all shops,"
00:38:02,00:38:04,and they were going to take the last amount of money
00:38:04,00:38:06,"that they'd made, which was a million pounds,"
00:38:06,00:38:09,"take it out of their account and take it to an island,"
00:38:09,00:38:13,"a juror, which is in Scotland, and they went to a boat shed,"
00:38:13,00:38:16,"and they set it alight, and they burnt a million pounds."
00:38:16,00:38:19,And there's a lot of controversy. Did they really do it?
00:38:19,00:38:21,They claim they absolutely did.
00:38:21,00:38:23,A lot of people are very skeptical.
00:38:23,00:38:26,There's been a few investigations into it where the BBC have seen
00:38:26,00:38:28,"that they've taken the money out from the bank,"
00:38:28,00:38:31,and they've found little bits of burnt embers
00:38:31,00:38:35,that matched when little numbers that would appear on specific bills
00:38:35,00:38:38,kind of matched the ones that were taken from the bank.
00:38:38,00:38:41,But did they really do it? Is a question a lot of people have?
00:38:41,00:38:43,"I think they did. James, I think you're a sceptical."
00:38:43,00:38:46,"I think they didn't. Just on balance of probability,"
00:38:46,00:38:48,I think they didn't. They might have done.
00:38:48,00:38:50,"Quite often we have facts on this, and I'm like,"
00:38:50,00:38:52,"""That's definitely bullshit."""
00:38:52,00:38:54,"This one, I'm about 60/40 that it's bullshit."
00:38:54,00:38:58,"But for instance, the little bits of burnt notes that they found,"
00:38:58,00:39:00,"they were found by a farmer,"
00:39:00,00:39:02,but it turned out that the farmer's son had gone to school
00:39:02,00:39:04,with one of the band.
00:39:04,00:39:07,So it's quite a nice coincidence that they found it.
00:39:07,00:39:11,I read an interview with the journalist who first wrote it up.
00:39:11,00:39:14,"He was called Michael Pilgrim, who's working for the Observer magazine,"
00:39:14,00:39:17,and he says that he still doesn't know for sure
00:39:17,00:39:19,whether it was true or whether it wasn't true.
00:39:19,00:39:21,"I think that was the journalist who received the story,"
00:39:21,00:39:23,but he wasn't there. It was Jim Reid who was there.
00:39:23,00:39:25,"Sorry, he wrote it up. Yeah, yeah."
00:39:25,00:39:28,"So Jim Reid thought they definitely did it, I think."
00:39:28,00:39:31,And this guy reckons that they definitely burnt some money
00:39:31,00:39:34,"because he has some of the money that was burnt in his house,"
00:39:34,00:39:37,"but he thinks possibly not a million pounds,"
00:39:37,00:39:39,which I think is where I stand on it.
00:39:39,00:39:42,"In 2017, they were discussing it"
00:39:42,00:39:44,"at this festival that Don was talking about,"
00:39:44,00:39:46,"where they asked audiences why they did it,"
00:39:46,00:39:49,"and they got an economist to describe it as quantitative tightening,"
00:39:49,00:39:52,which is a really good phrase.
00:39:52,00:39:55,"And there are acts who are burning money today,"
00:39:55,00:39:58,"so there's an organisation called Burn Your Money,"
00:39:58,00:40:01,which sent some members in 2017 to the island of Jura
00:40:01,00:40:03,to burn some of their own money.
00:40:03,00:40:05,"And they even have their own magazine, this organisation,"
00:40:05,00:40:07,which is called Burning Issue.
00:40:07,00:40:10,"Why are they doing that, just to imitate the grace?"
00:40:10,00:40:12,"Why do the initial guys do it? Yeah, exactly."
00:40:12,00:40:15,"So initially, after they did it,"
00:40:15,00:40:17,"there was a documentary made about it,"
00:40:17,00:40:19,"because they had a friend called Gimpo who was with them,"
00:40:19,00:40:21,"who filmed it, so we do have footage of this stuff."
00:40:21,00:40:23,"Now, what's his real name, was it?"
00:40:23,00:40:25,I can't even remember. He's called Alan Goodrich.
00:40:25,00:40:27,"Right, Alan Goodrich."
00:40:27,00:40:29,"And so you can be sure if he's called Gimpo,"
00:40:29,00:40:31,it's probably not his real name.
00:40:31,00:40:33,"It could be Mark's brother, I don't know."
00:40:33,00:40:36,"To Mr and Mrs Goodrich, a son, Gimpo."
00:40:36,00:40:39,"So they took this video around the country,"
00:40:39,00:40:41,"and they asked these questions, you know,"
00:40:41,00:40:43,"""Why do you think we did it?"""
00:40:43,00:40:45,"Because they genuinely couldn't quite work it out,"
00:40:45,00:40:48,"but they are an artistic band, and there's a..."
00:40:48,00:40:52,So I got this fact from a book that's called The KLF by John Higgs.
00:40:52,00:40:55,"It is genuinely, I think, the best non-fiction book I've ever read."
00:40:55,00:40:57,"Genuinely, it's my favourite non-fiction book."
00:40:57,00:41:00,"It's magical, and it's not just about this band."
00:41:00,00:41:02,"It's about what they encompass,"
00:41:02,00:41:05,"the worlds of the occult, the esoteric,"
00:41:05,00:41:07,everything that was going on in pop music.
00:41:07,00:41:09,"It's just... John Higgs, stunning."
00:41:09,00:41:12,"And basically, what they decided was,"
00:41:12,00:41:14,"after they went around showing this video,"
00:41:14,00:41:17,"and not getting anywhere, but getting a lot of people furious with them,"
00:41:17,00:41:20,that they would not talk about it for years and years and years.
00:41:20,00:41:23,"So they signed a contract on the side of a car, a rented car,"
00:41:23,00:41:27,"pushed it off a cliff as an official contract,"
00:41:27,00:41:30,and didn't really talk about it for 23 years.
00:41:30,00:41:32,It usually came up in conversations.
00:41:32,00:41:35,I bet it came up in conversations with the car rental firm.
00:41:35,00:41:39,"That film was really interesting, because they filmed it,"
00:41:39,00:41:44,and then they kind of destroyed the camcorder.
00:41:44,00:41:46,"But then the person who filmed it, who was Gimpo, said,"
00:41:46,00:41:50,"""Oh, actually, I'd already made a copy of it, so we can have that instead."""
00:41:50,00:41:52,And he turned that into a little film.
00:41:52,00:41:56,"And they advertised that they were going to show it in Brick Lane in London,"
00:41:56,00:42:00,and that anyone who turned up could get free lager.
00:42:00,00:42:02,So lots of people turned up.
00:42:02,00:42:05,"But too many people turned up, so they had to cancel the whole event."
00:42:05,00:42:11,"And they were stuck with 6,237 cans of Tenant Super."
00:42:11,00:42:13,"This was on Christmas Eve,"
00:42:13,00:42:16,and they decided to give it to the homeless.
00:42:18,00:42:24,Before someone working for the charity Crisis said they were utterly irresponsible.
00:42:24,00:42:30,"I think they were the first people to describe them as that, I suspect."
00:42:30,00:42:34,It sounds like the maddest experience to be on this money-burning expedition.
00:42:34,00:42:36,I wish I'd been that one journalist.
00:42:36,00:42:38,And they were so random in what they did.
00:42:38,00:42:41,"They just picked this guy at Jim Reid, and called him up."
00:42:41,00:42:43,He doesn't know what he's getting into.
00:42:43,00:42:46,"He's told to get in the car with these two guys, and Gimpo in the back."
00:42:46,00:42:50,"They buy suitcases in London, two massive suitcases."
00:42:50,00:42:54,They go to a security firm and extract all of this cash.
00:42:54,00:42:56,And then disappear to Jura.
00:42:56,00:43:00,"And it sounds so annoying as well, because he'd be so knackered after that long, confusing day."
00:43:00,00:43:02,"And they said, ""Okay, we're going to burn all the money tomorrow."""
00:43:02,00:43:06,"And then Gimpo goes to bed, writes off his notes for the day, puts his head on the pillow,"
00:43:06,00:43:08,"and immediately they bang on his hotel door at midnight and go,"
00:43:08,00:43:11,"""Actually, we're going to do it now. Come on, we can't wait."""
00:43:11,00:43:12,They said it was like Christmas.
00:43:12,00:43:15,"You know, you're so excited, you can't wait till the morning."
00:43:15,00:43:21,"And yeah, they went and they did it in this little, I think it was like a little stone kind of structure."
00:43:21,00:43:26,"But he said, ""The first thing you feel is incredibly guilty as you're watching this money disappear."""
00:43:26,00:43:31,"And then for the subsequent two or three hours, because it does take quite a long time to burn a million pounds,"
00:43:31,00:43:35,you are just really bored for a lot of it.
00:43:35,00:43:37,"But yeah, so surreal."
00:43:37,00:43:42,"Well, the line that someone said about it was, it's one thing to start burning a million pounds."
00:43:42,00:43:45,It's another thing to finish burning a million pounds.
00:43:45,00:43:50,"And that is something that has really made them really question everything,"
00:43:50,00:43:52,the fact that they went for the whole thing.
00:43:52,00:43:56,"Well, it made people so angry, because obviously they could have given that money to charity."
00:43:56,00:44:01,"They could have given it to, you know, members of the French aristocracy who would dance all their life."
00:44:01,00:44:04,They could have just kept it and pretended that they burnt it.
00:44:04,00:44:06,"Yeah, you know."
00:44:06,00:44:10,"Lots of people said that if you burn money by spending it on cocaine or whatever,"
00:44:10,00:44:14,then you're forgiven much more easily than burning physical money.
00:44:14,00:44:18,It feels very sacrilegious.
00:44:18,00:44:21,But they were constantly doing stuff like this.
00:44:21,00:44:24,They tried to spend their money in very creative ways.
00:44:24,00:44:27,"So after they'd had a really big hit of one or another with their big hits,"
00:44:27,00:44:33,"they tried to spend the money they got from that, getting a massive helicopter and fixing Stonehenge,"
00:44:33,00:44:37,so that they could put it back to work again basically.
00:44:37,00:44:40,"They could come on, let's fire up the motors."
00:44:40,00:44:43,"I think also Bulldozer, they were going to bulldoze it down."
00:44:43,00:44:45,They bought a big bulldozer to do that.
00:44:45,00:44:50,"And didn't they bury their Brittle wards underneath, supposedly?"
00:44:50,00:44:51,I guess.
00:44:51,00:44:54,I think I was conveniently found a few weeks later by a friend.
00:44:54,00:44:56,You're very skeptical about this.
00:44:56,00:45:01,"Well, you know, it might be true, but the thing is they did have form for lots of little tricks and stuff."
00:45:01,00:45:05,"So they made crop circles, for instance."
00:45:05,00:45:11,"There was one time where one of the guys drove around with a massive sound equipment in his car,"
00:45:11,00:45:15,which he claimed was powerful enough to kill livestock.
00:45:15,00:45:16,"Right, wow."
00:45:16,00:45:18,He was going to kill a load of cars with this massive thing.
00:45:18,00:45:19,Wow.
00:45:19,00:45:24,"They could kill one red deer with this sound system, or four of them."
00:45:24,00:45:25,You decide.
00:45:25,00:45:27,"And so it's two guys, the KLF."
00:45:27,00:45:32,"It's Drummond and Corti, and Bill Drummond, I love reading about Bill Drummond."
00:45:32,00:45:33,His ideas are just so wonderful.
00:45:33,00:45:37,"One thing that he did, and I don't know if this is still going, I hope he still does it,"
00:45:37,00:45:41,but Bill Drummond created a soup line across the British Isles.
00:45:41,00:45:47,"And the idea was if anyone lives on Bill Drummond's soup line, you can look it up."
00:45:47,00:45:51,"If you live and your house happens to be on the soup line, you can contact Bill Drummond,"
00:45:51,00:45:53,and he'll come to your house and make you some soup.
00:45:53,00:45:54,That's...
00:45:54,00:45:55,No.
00:45:55,00:45:58,Did anyone... Did it work? Can we do that?
00:45:58,00:45:59,I hope it's still going.
00:45:59,00:46:01,"I'm not sure, but the soup line exists, and he did do that."
00:46:01,00:46:05,"You'd have to plan it carefully so it didn't go through a major place, like Belfast."
00:46:05,00:46:07,"No, it's incredible."
00:46:07,00:46:08,The soup line.
00:46:08,00:46:09,Wow.
00:46:09,00:46:11,He sounds wonderful.
00:46:11,00:46:16,"The Guardian interviewed him in 2000, which was years and years after they burned the money,"
00:46:16,00:46:18,"and they asked him, ""Have you regretted it since?"""
00:46:18,00:46:19,"He said, ""No."""
00:46:19,00:46:21,"""Are you financially stable now?"""
00:46:21,00:46:23,"""No, I'm not. No."""
00:46:23,00:46:26,"And then in 2004, he said, ""Of course I regretted it."""
00:46:26,00:46:29,And so you can't work out the truth about them.
00:46:29,00:46:30,No.
00:46:30,00:46:32,"They're really, really, really interesting people."
00:46:32,00:46:35,"One thing about Drummond is he does like his lines,"
00:46:35,00:46:41,"and he believes that there's a lay line that goes from Iceland to Papua New Guinea,"
00:46:41,00:46:43,"and it goes through Liverpool,"
00:46:43,00:46:46,"and the energy of the Earth comes down from space into Reykjavik,"
00:46:46,00:46:49,"goes all the way under the Earth, and then comes out of Papua New Guinea,"
00:46:49,00:46:52,and also comes out of a manhole cover in Liverpool.
00:46:52,00:46:56,"And this manhole cover is just outside the cabin club,"
00:46:56,00:46:58,and that's what he kind of thinks.
00:46:58,00:46:59,"Yeah, Matthew Street, yeah."
00:46:59,00:47:00,Exactly.
00:47:00,00:47:03,"And one time, he was the manager of Echo and the Bunnyman,"
00:47:03,00:47:05,"who a lot of you will know, a band,"
00:47:05,00:47:08,"and he got them a gig in Reykjavik, got them to play,"
00:47:08,00:47:13,and then stood over this manhole cover to listen to see if the music came out.
00:47:13,00:47:15,I did not come out.
00:47:15,00:47:19,"But part of his evidence is, you know Carl Jung, the psychoanalyst?"
00:47:19,00:47:20,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:47:20,00:47:24,"So Carl Jung apparently wrote once that he'd never been to Liverpool,"
00:47:24,00:47:26,"but he had a dream about Liverpool,"
00:47:26,00:47:31,"and he thought, Carl Jung said Liverpool is a pool of life it makes to live,"
00:47:31,00:47:34,and there's a statue of Carl Jung on Matthew Street.
00:47:34,00:47:37,"Yeah, it's a bust that sits up in a building,"
00:47:37,00:47:39,because there was a guy called Peter O'Halligan who'd heard.
00:47:39,00:47:42,So this was a game-changing dream of Carl Jung's life.
00:47:42,00:47:45,"He was like the pool of life, and then he said it's in Liverpool,"
00:47:45,00:47:47,"and Peter O'Halligan went around,"
00:47:47,00:47:51,"and he looked for descriptions that would match where Jung might have dreamed in his head,"
00:47:51,00:47:55,and he discovered that there was this manhole sitting at the end
00:47:55,00:47:58,"of literally 30 seconds' walk from the cavern,"
00:47:58,00:48:03,which is why maybe the Beatles had such mystic powers and so on.
00:48:03,00:48:06,And presumably... Have I lost everyone?
00:48:06,00:48:08,"Presumably Jung didn't believe any of this,"
00:48:08,00:48:12,"but thought it was a chaos against anything, or really believes it."
00:48:12,00:48:15,"I think he might believe some of it, although we'd have to get him here,"
00:48:15,00:48:17,we're just... I wish we could get him here.
00:48:17,00:48:21,"On his 60th birthday, he stood for 17 hours on that manhole."
00:48:21,00:48:23,"He didn't believe it, yeah. 17 hours."
00:48:23,00:48:25,"Thinking about life, thinking about what he was doing."
00:48:25,00:48:28,"Yeah, it's an important manhole."
00:48:28,00:48:31,I think we've mentioned before that Jeremy Corbyn also collects manhole covers.
00:48:31,00:48:33,"He does. Well, he doesn't collect them."
00:48:33,00:48:35,"Sorry, that makes him sound incredibly irresponsible,"
00:48:35,00:48:38,but he is an expert on them. He knows about them.
00:48:38,00:48:41,He collects him trying to tug it from out from under drama.
00:48:41,00:48:44,You're not getting this one!
00:48:44,00:48:49,"Just to draw us back towards the realms of the possible for a bit,"
00:48:49,00:48:51,"that music is really interesting,"
00:48:51,00:48:55,because they were hugely influential in starting sampling other tracks.
00:48:55,00:48:56,Yes.
00:48:56,00:48:58,And they were one of some of the first people to do that.
00:48:58,00:49:02,"So in 1987, they sampled a passage from ""Dancing Queen"" by ABBA,"
00:49:02,00:49:06,"and ABBA were not happy about it, and ABBA sued them"
00:49:06,00:49:10,"and said, ""You've got to destroy all the unsolved copies of this record"
00:49:10,00:49:13,"that you've produced, all the unsolved vinyl records."""
00:49:13,00:49:16,"So then, the KLF, the two of them, they travelled to Stockholm"
00:49:16,00:49:20,to give Agnita from ABBA a commemorative gold disc.
00:49:20,00:49:24,"They couldn't find her, because they were just walking around in Stockholm."
00:49:24,00:49:29,So they gave the gold disc to a random prostitute they met in the street
00:49:29,00:49:33,"and came home, pausing only to throw the LPs off the ferry as they went."
00:49:33,00:49:35,And then they burned the rest in a field.
00:49:35,00:49:37,"They love burning things in fields, the KLF."
00:49:37,00:49:40,"They love burning stuff, and they love throwing stuff into the sea."
00:49:40,00:49:43,"It's true. It's their jam, and I dig it."
00:49:43,00:49:47,That trip to Sweden sounds very entertaining.
00:49:47,00:49:52,"They did sit outside ABBA's record label in a police car that they'd managed to get hold of,"
00:49:52,00:49:57,and they blasted the record that they made from which they'd stolen ABBA's music out at ABBA's record label.
00:49:57,00:49:58,And then they...
00:49:58,00:50:00,Imagine being inside the office for that. That's thrilling.
00:50:00,00:50:02,"You know, the police are here. What do they want?"
00:50:02,00:50:03,It's hard to tell.
00:50:05,00:50:07,Is this a new siren?
00:50:07,00:50:09,Very confusing.
00:50:09,00:50:11,They killed a moose accidentally.
00:50:11,00:50:14,They hit and killed a moose on that trip.
00:50:14,00:50:17,"And also, they were shot at by a farmer who didn't understand"
00:50:17,00:50:19,and we didn't like them burning shit in his field.
00:50:19,00:50:21,But they're never getting permission for anything.
00:50:21,00:50:23,"So the farmer's just looking out of his window, and he's like,"
00:50:23,00:50:27,"""Oh my God, two musicians are burning huge piles of music in my crop field."""
00:50:27,00:50:32,"And so they shot their car, and they claimed they had to be towed back to England by the AA."
00:50:32,00:50:35,"Which I didn't know the AA did call out to Gothenburg, but..."
00:50:35,00:50:36,They're very good.
00:50:36,00:50:40,So Andy mentioned 2017.
00:50:40,00:50:42,They had a panel to talk about why they did it.
00:50:42,00:50:45,"So there was this thing, when they pushed the car off the edge of the cliff,"
00:50:45,00:50:48,"23 years they said, ""We're not going to talk about it."""
00:50:48,00:50:51,"And we will, in 23 years' time, have the answer,"
00:50:51,00:50:53,"""Why did we burn this money?"""
00:50:53,00:50:58,So they set up this big festival where they were going to answer the question in 2017.
00:50:58,00:51:01,"And there's an amazing hour of footage you can watch on YouTube,"
00:51:01,00:51:05,"just from one person filming the whole thing, where the KLF return."
00:51:05,00:51:09,"And they've got a big announcement, and they arrive in an ice cream van,"
00:51:09,00:51:11,and they've written a new book.
00:51:11,00:51:15,"And their big announcement, outside of trying to answer why they did the money burning,"
00:51:15,00:51:21,"is that they're now no longer just musicians, but they're in the funeral business as well."
00:51:21,00:51:24,"And what they've done is, in Toxteth, in Liverpool..."
00:51:24,00:51:28,"They'll burn you in a field, they'll throw you into the ocean."
00:51:28,00:51:32,"They've set up this idea that you can buy, and I've seen it online,"
00:51:32,00:51:34,and I almost bought a brick the other day.
00:51:34,00:51:38,"You can buy a brick where you put in, if someone's passed away,"
00:51:38,00:51:42,"a milligram, I think it is, or a few milligrams of the ashes of that person,"
00:51:42,00:51:47,"and it gets baked into the brick, and they're building a ginormous pyramid in Toxteth,"
00:51:47,00:51:53,"where every year they add new bricks to it, and it's going to be something 30-something thousand bricks."
00:51:53,00:51:56,"That happens to do it, I think. They haven't started yet, have they?"
00:51:56,00:52:00,How have they got planning permission from the people of Toxteth?
00:52:00,00:52:02,Because I imagine there'll be questions about this huge...
00:52:02,00:52:05,"Yeah, the Toxteth Day of the Dead, it happens on November 23rd."
00:52:05,00:52:07,"It's going to happen this year, I'm going to it."
00:52:07,00:52:08,Toxteth Day of the Dead?
00:52:08,00:52:11,"Yeah, it's a big festival, they walk through the streets..."
00:52:11,00:52:13,It's not a big festival.
00:52:13,00:52:15,It's not Glastonbury.
00:52:15,00:52:17,It's a couple of old rockers.
00:52:17,00:52:19,"I've never heard of it, yeah."
00:52:19,00:52:21,"No, it's new. 2017 was the first one."
00:52:21,00:52:25,"Yeah, it's about 400 people, and they would walk through the cities of Toxteth,"
00:52:25,00:52:28,wearing the classic Day of the Dead sort of stuff.
00:52:28,00:52:32,"You would buy a ticket, and you didn't know what to expect, you didn't know what you would do,"
00:52:32,00:52:38,"and they would take the numbers, and if you were number one to 20 or something,"
00:52:38,00:52:42,"you would have to form a band, and then the next people would have to get a tattoo done."
00:52:42,00:52:45,"It was like Taskmaster, really, it's pretty much like that."
00:52:45,00:52:50,"And another group had to commandeer as many supermarket trolleys as they could,"
00:52:50,00:52:52,and stuff like that.
00:52:52,00:52:55,"But before they did this, before they started doing this pyramid,"
00:52:55,00:52:57,"which they will probably do,"
00:52:57,00:53:01,they had another idea where they wanted to build a pyramid containing the same amount of bricks
00:53:01,00:53:04,as there were people born in the 20th century.
00:53:04,00:53:06,"It's quite a nice idea, isn't it?"
00:53:06,00:53:07,How is that?
00:53:07,00:53:09,"Well, unfortunately, it's ten billion."
00:53:09,00:53:12,The Great Pyramid in Giza has 2.3 million.
00:53:12,00:53:14,Right.
00:53:14,00:53:16,So it would have been a hell of a pyramid.
00:53:16,00:53:19,"Yeah, tiny bricks, and then LEGO bricks."
00:53:19,00:53:23,Are they selling those bricks in it?
00:53:23,00:53:25,Is it a pyramid scheme?
00:53:25,00:53:27,That's what I'm trying to say.
00:53:27,00:53:28,Thank you.
00:53:28,00:53:29,Thank you.
00:53:29,00:53:30,Very nice.
00:53:30,00:53:32,"Hey, we've got to wrap up."
00:53:32,00:53:34,We can't end on that.
00:53:34,00:53:37,"That is it, that is all of our facts."
00:53:37,00:53:39,Thank you so much for listening.
