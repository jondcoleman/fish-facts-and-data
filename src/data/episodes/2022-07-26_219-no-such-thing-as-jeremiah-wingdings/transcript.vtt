00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.400
 *stammering*

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.400

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.700

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.700

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.100
 Hello and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish"

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.400
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.500
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I'm sitting here with "Annotch" Zitsky

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:35.000
 Andrew Hunter, Murray and James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 Starting with you, Chazinsky.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.500
 My fact this week is that in Singapore, pet fish have plastic surgeons.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.500
 *laughs*

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.500
 So...

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.500
 Do they get a trout-pout?

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.000
 Hey!

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 A trout-pout?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.500
 Does anyone know that phrase?

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.500
 No, it's a trout.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.500
 I do know that, it's when you put a load of stuff in your lips.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.500
 For having fillers in your lips, you get what is called a trout-pout.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.500
 It's actually a clever joke.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.500
 Tell us about this fish, Anna.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.500
 So...

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.500
 *laughs*

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.500
 A great start.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.500
 So what do you have done if you're a fish?

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.500
 You first start, you don't have a trout-pout because this is what is a specific kind of fish and it's the Arawana fish, which isn't a trout.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.500
 Actually, humans aren't trout-s either and we have trout-pouts.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.500
 It's weirder for us to get a trout-pout than it is for the fish.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.500
 Alright, this fish is slightly closer to a trout than a human.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:30.500
 But nonetheless, the Arawana fish is a very prized fish as a pet in China and in other Asian countries.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.500
 And including Singapore.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:41.500
 And I read this article in the New York Times, which sort of profiled this guy called Eugene Ung, who is one of the premier cosmetic surgeons for Asian fish in Singapore.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.500
 He was described as.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.500
 And yeah, he does them up.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.500
 You get lots of things done.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.500
 So they often get their eyelids raised.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.500
 They've got droopy eyelids, so they'll go into their eyelids and he'll take some of the tissue out and budge their eyeball further up into the socket.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.500
 Yeah, it's a very exciting industry.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.500
 It's amazing. And he runs a fish shop.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.500
 Doesn't he? Like a pet shop where you just buy them.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.500
 So this is a guy who's either behind the counter selling you a goldfish or then going behind the scenes and cutting them up into...

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.500
 What's the aim?

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.500
 What's the aim to make them look more attractive?

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.500
 See humans.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.500
 If he's selling them, he's making them look better.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.500
 Yeah.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.500
 And so he's going to sell them for more or sell more of them.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.500
 He says in this article that Anna read, he says, "I know some people think it's cruel to the fish, but really I'm doing it a favor."

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.500
 Because now the fish looks better and the owner will love it even more.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.500
 Do you know it's really weird to quote an article that X read when X isn't you?

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.500
 Because you've read the article as well, because you'll leave your question for me.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.500
 I think he's only read this paragraph.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.500
 I just read quotes.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.500
 It makes it sound like I've just sent you a few choice quotes for the podcast.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.500
 I have to say it is an extremely weird custom though.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.500
 It is an extremely weird.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.500
 And I should say the person who sent me this was Lauren who's one of the other elves.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.500
 I don't remember that this morning, so she emailed this amazing article to me.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.500
 Do you know what happens when you're a fish having an operation?

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:02.500
 What they do is they get anaesthetic water and they put the fish in a bowl or tank of anaesthetic water to knock it out.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.500
 And then they pull it out of the tank, they put it on the slab to operate on it.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:12.500
 And then you have to have one person on either side pushing syringes of water over the gills so it keeps breathing nicely.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.500
 And then you have to have a third person who's refilling the syringes for the people who are blasting the fish.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.500
 So it's a massive operation and then you have to have the surgeon.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.500
 Well, I read that it's not even just it's not the anaesthetic water that you need for it.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.500
 So I was reading about a goldfish called George who had a brain tumour and he was being operated on.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.500
 And George, when he was being, when he was under, they took actual buckets of water from the pond that he was from,

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.500
 so that it would be the natural water that he was accustomed to.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.500
 And that was being splashed over his gills the whole time as well.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.500
 There's a fish which received a glass eye to stop other fish bullying it.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.500
 Are they bullying it?

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.500
 Yeah, they were attacking it in the water because it was a sign of weakness.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.500
 That's what happens. George was being bullied for having a brain tumour.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.500
 The fish could be so cruel.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.500
 But don't you think you need their kind of, right?

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.500
 If you've got bullies, you don't deal with it by fixing the problem with the person who's being bullied.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.500
 You speak to the bullies themselves and get them to change their ways.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.500
 You speak to the bullies parents, ideally.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.500
 Exactly, but what you're doing basically is just saying that they're right to bullying almost.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:16.500
 That's true.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:23.500
 And it's silly this ideal of the perfect looking fish we've raised up and we've tried to make everyone want to look like that.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.500
 If you want to have droopy eyelids, I think you should be allowed to have droopy eyelids.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.500
 And they're being made to feel like they can't.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.500
 I agree. And because they were saying that these owners are going to love the fish even more because they're beautiful.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.500
 I mean, that is pretty shallow as well.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.500
 Yeah, it is.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:36.500
 You shouldn't. Yeah.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.500
 I always think if your fish is shallow-ness.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.500
 The fish is greatest fear.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.500
 These are owners.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.500
 They are so.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.500
 They're amazing.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.500
 They're amazing.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.500
 They're the best fish.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.500
 They even the droopy eyelid ones.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.500
 They're so good.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.500
 So people are obsessed with them.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.500
 There's one guy in the article that Anna read and that Dan's selectively read.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.500
 He was interviewed.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.500
 He's called Nicholas Cheer and he has a fish tank which covers a third of his living room.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.500
 That is a big proportion.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.500
 But he said, sometimes my wife complains that I neglect the children because of the fish.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.500
 To a certain extent, yes, I guess that's true.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.500
 But actually, back in the 1970s, they were very popular at all.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.500
 Right.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.500
 And what happened was they were just an ordinary fish that you would eat for food.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.500
 But actually, they weren't even that tasty.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.500
 So people didn't really eat them much.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.500
 But the thing is, it's an apex predator.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.500
 It's slow reproducing.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.500
 So the populations of it are very small.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.500
 And so it ended up on the list of protected species.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.500
 And that backfired because they became so rare that everyone wanted them.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.500
 Yeah.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.500
 It's such a good example of how trends happen.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.500
 It always happens in history, doesn't it?

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.500
 As soon as something becomes rare, like lobster used to be common and peasant food.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.500
 And then suddenly it's rarer and it's a prized commodity.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.500
 And I think they've sort of back justified it now and said that they look a bit like dragons.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.500
 So they're called Long Yu, which is dragonfish in China.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.500
 And it's because they have these kind of whiskers that I guess dragons also have whiskers.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.500
 Yeah.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.500
 And also they kind of swim up and down, don't they?

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.500
 Like an eel, but it's like one of those dragons in the New Year carnival.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.500
 Yep.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:09.500
 And they're very aggressive.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.500
 Which dragons I guess are sometimes, yeah, they're really aggressive and they've got terrible bites.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:14.500
 Right.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:20.500
 So they're on the side of virtually every porcelain bowl that I would have eaten from as a child.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.500
 Yeah, it's a classic fish that you would have drawn on the side of a bowl.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.500
 And they've got like glittery sparkly scales, haven't they?

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.500
 And they get, and they really focus on how to make them more attractive.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:36.500
 Not only with the plastic surgery, but they're often placed under neon pink tanning lights.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:41.500
 And it's because they've got like a reddish hue. And if you put them under the tanning lights, they can go really pink.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:42.500
 And they look nicer.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.500
 Doesn't sound healthy.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.500
 They're growing the Amazon, don't they as well?

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.500
 They're a silver Arowana fish in the Amazon.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.500
 And they jump out of the water to catch prey.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.500
 So some of them have been found with birds or bats in the stomach.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:55.500
 Wow.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.500
 This is the cool thing though.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:01.500
 Some people believe that Arowana fish will jump out of the fish tank to sacrifice their lives

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.500
 to warn owners about a bad business investment.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.500
 So just as you're picking up the phone, I think I think I'm going to buy some of that stock today.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.500
 The fish will smash out of the water.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.500
 That doesn't sound very true, does it?

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.500
 It doesn't sound very true.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.500
 I would like to go into business deal with a person who believes that.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:21.500
 You were saying the silver Arowana jumps out on each bats.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.500
 The golden Arowana.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:30.500
 Apparently it has been said, jumps out of the water and grabs small monkeys from over hanging branches.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:31.500
 Wow.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:32.500
 And it eats the monkeys.

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.500
 Yeah, they'll take anything.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.500
 Snakes, any kind of small mammals.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:40.500
 And I've watched this really horrible video because a lot of this information comes from this book.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:45.500
 This sounds amazing, which is a woman called Emily Voight wrote a book called The Dragon Behind the Glass.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.500
 And she always got really obsessed with these fish.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:55.500
 And there's one line in her book where she says, "Whatever you do, don't look up YouTube videos of Arowana fish dragging duckling underwater."

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:56.500
 And what did you do?

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:57.500
 Well, I obviously did that.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.500
 I honestly thought I might find it quite entertaining in a way.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.500
 And it was just extremely unpleasant.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.500
 So I know everyone's going to now do this at home, but honestly, don't look up.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:06.500
 What are you doing?

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:07.500
 Yeah, I wanted this.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.500
 This is like the movie The Ring, isn't it?

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:15.500
 Just in China, I was reading that goldfish.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.500
 Goldfish meant to be yellowfish, really.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.500
 It's a breeding process.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.500
 That means that we have the more orangy color.

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.500
 This is a result of the song dynasty.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:28.500
 In the song dynasty, yellow was the color of the royal family.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:34.500
 And so the Empress forbade anyone from having yellow fish if they were non-royal

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.500
 because it would be a signal of having a posh fish.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.500
 So they all had to go for the more orangy type.

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.500
 And that was sort of bread and bread and bread.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:45.500
 And that became the one that was sort of mutated into the wild.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:46.500
 The one that we know today.

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:48.500
 But I remember reading once, and I don't know if this is true.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.500
 That if you get a goldfish and just put it in the river, then it loses its goldness

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.500
 and it just becomes a fish.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:54.500
 Really?

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.500
 They're not gold anyway, aren't they? They're orange.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.500
 It's a very different color to gold.

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.500
 Yeah, that's not very different.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.500
 Oh, well, I've got a rig that you might want to buy.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.500
 A fish in the background.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:07.500
 Don't do it.

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:14.500
 Just because this is a fact about surgery on your pets.

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:18.500
 We've never mentioned neutacles before as a concept.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:23.500
 But this is estimated that 500,000 dogs have had neutacles attached.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:28.500
 And these are fake testicles because when they get the real testicles chopped off,

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:32.500
 they get very self-conscious and they get bullied by their friends.

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:36.500
 So they get neutacles surgically attached, testicular implants.

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:38.500
 They're really good, actually.

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.500
 They're the dog's bollocks.

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:41.500
 Very nice.

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:42.500
 James and I have held them.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:43.500
 What?

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:44.500
 Yeah, sorry.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:45.500
 Did you say you and James have got them?

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:46.500
 No, we've held them.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.500
 Oh, sorry.

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:48.500
 Yeah.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:50.500
 I was getting very badly bullied in the office.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.500
 They won an ignoble.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:54.500
 Exactly.

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:59.500
 Mark Abrams of ignoble, he was downstairs in the office with us and he pulled a dog's testicle out.

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:00.500
 Plastic.

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:01.500
 Can you get a range of sizes?

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.500
 Because obviously dogs have different size testicles, don't they?

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:06.500
 As in chihuahua, it's one of the same size as great-day testicles.

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:12.500
 But it would be very funny to fit a chihuahua with great-day neutacles and vice versa, actually.

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:13.500
 Yes.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.500
 It would be like a space hopper, wouldn't it?

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:15.500
 The chihuahua.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:16.500
 That's true.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.500
 That point.

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:18.500
 Two space hoppers.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.500
 You say 500,000 dogs.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:21.500
 Yeah.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:22.500
 That's huge.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:23.500
 Half a million dogs.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:24.500
 But they get lots of plastic surgery.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:25.500
 They get tummy tucks.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:26.500
 That's apparently quite common now.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:33.500
 And also Botox to like perk up their faces, because you know those pug dogs are pretty saggy skin.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:34.500
 I've forgotten really popular.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.500
 But isn't that the point of a pug?

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.500
 No, but they would have pug look like with an entirely smooth face.

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:39.500
 It would look nightmare.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.500
 No, but they've been bred into...

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:48.500
 They've been bred into not being able to breathe, right?

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:49.500
 They're just helping them.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:53.500
 I'm not saying the answer is more intervention though, is it?

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:54.500
 No, this is what humans do.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:59.500
 We make enormous mistakes, and then we make other enormous mistakes to counteract the enormous mistakes we originally made.

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:03.500
 Why couldn't we have left the dogs alone in the first place?

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:12.500
 I was looking into weird surgeries as well, and I left the animal proper dog and fish animal world and went to the human animal world.

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.500
 So just very quickly, this is off-topic.

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.500
 But you know you can get holiday boobs now.

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:18.500
 Holiday breasts.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:19.500
 No.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.500
 This is an interesting thing that's been happening in America.

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.500
 New York, there's a plastic surgeon who's created a thing called the Instabrest.

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:31.500
 And what it is is rather than giving you actual breast surgery, he gives you this sort of saline injection,

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:36.500
 which makes you have enhanced boobs for 24 hours, and then it goes away.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:41.500
 The saline just sort of disappears, and he's now developed, and they're still running tests on it,

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:45.500
 ones that you can use that will last two to three weeks for the time of a holiday.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:51.500
 So you go away, you have your boobs done up, and then by the time you get back, they sort of go back to what they were before.

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.500
 Is that really weird?

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:54.500
 Yeah.

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.500
 I don't think that's going to catch on.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:03.500
 What he says is that for a lot of people who want to test the idea of having a breast implants, rather than having to do it,

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.500
 and often what they do is 3D models and so on.

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.500
 So what it is, it's just a quick sort of go for a day of go.

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:09.500
 Actually, I like this.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:13.500
 You do it when you're on holiday, so that your people at work don't see you looking like that.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:17.500
 It's like if you try and grow a beard, you go on holiday for two weeks, and you're like,

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:19.500
 "Oh, maybe I won't shave to see what I look like."

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:23.500
 And then you always shave before you come back, because you look like an idiot.

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:27.500
 Is this man offering a holiday penis yet?

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:32.500
 Holiday testicles, which are larger for the beach.

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.500
 For bouncing around the beach.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:44.500
 Okay, there's time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:50.500
 My fact this week is that according to scientists, you're more likely to win the Tour de France if you're a good looking.

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:53.500
 Yeah, this is a...

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:58.500
 Is it because you are more streamlined with your cheekbones looking all nice like that?

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:01.500
 Because your cheekbones would be sticking out a bit more, wouldn't they?

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:05.500
 If you had a really thin face with no cheekbones, then actually you would be much more...

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:07.500
 Well, that is my idea of beauty chains, actually.

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:08.500
 It's an extremely...

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:10.500
 Long nose, like a very card.

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.500
 Yeah, but a head that's basically an arrow.

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:14.500
 An arrowhead.

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.500
 It's my idea of beauty, and no one can tell me off for it.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:20.500
 Well, this study, it's like an average thing, right?

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:23.500
 There are loads of people, so you would be an outlier in this case.

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.500
 Yeah, this was done by Dr. Eric Postma.

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:30.500
 This was at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Zurich.

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:31.500
 It's the University of Zurich.

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:38.500
 And he asked 800 participants to score the cyclist's attractiveness based on their facial appearances.

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:44.500
 If the person recognized who the cyclist was, like a Lance Armstrong or Bradley Wiggins, they disqualified that.

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:49.500
 So it had to be people they didn't know. They used 80 professional cyclists that they picked from.

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:54.500
 And it was from the 2012 Tour de France that they used the sample from.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:14:02.500
 And the results showed that the top 10% of performers were rated on an average of 25% better looking than the latter, if that makes sense.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.500
 Oh, so better cyclists are more good looking, even.

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.500
 So within the professional cyclist, the best of ones are more good at this.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:10.500
 It's only in professional cyclists, I think.

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:14.500
 Right, so we don't know if cyclists are more attractive than normal people.

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.500
 They might all be much uglier than normal.

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.500
 Have you ever seen a professional cyclist?

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:21.500
 Why do you think they cover themselves with helmets and sunglasses and things like that?

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:22.500
 Exactly.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.500
 They're quite unusual looking.

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:27.500
 Like, it might be, you know, it might be your thing and they don't know my faces.

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:30.500
 They usually have very big heads and very tiny bodies.

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:33.500
 And quite muscular legs.

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.500
 They're unusual looking, it's all the same.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:43.500
 Yeah. Team Sky, when this happened in 2012, they all had to wear sunglasses in all the photos.

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:45.500
 And these were the photos that they used.

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:48.500
 And in that year, Bradley Wiggins won the Tour de France.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:48.500
 Right.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:50.500
 And I come this, I think, they're pretty well in it.

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:54.500
 But they couldn't use any of the pictures for this study because they were wearing sunglasses.

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:55.500
 Ah.

00:14:55.500 --> 00:15:01.500
 So actually, the winner of the Tour de France in this study, Bradley Wiggins, was not part of the most attractive people.

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:06.500
 Are they wearing the sunglasses to disguise the dilated pupils from all the doping they're doing?

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:10.500
 I don't think so, Bradley Wiggins has ever been found guilty of anything.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:11.500
 Has he not yet?

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:12.500
 Okay.

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:13.500
 Yes.

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.500
 I'm on doping.

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:19.500
 So I didn't know how ingrained the history was in cycling.

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:22.500
 But this is in the very early days of the Tour de France.

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.500
 Two brothers who were cycling in it.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:25.500
 They boasted to a journalist.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.500
 And I'm quoting here directly.

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:30.500
 They said, we've got cocaine to go in our eyes, chloroform for our gums.

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.500
 And do you want to see the pills?

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.500
 And I don't think it was banned back then.

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:36.500
 No, it wasn't banned until the 60s, I don't think.

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:37.500
 Yeah.

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:39.500
 So it was a very exciting time.

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:42.500
 Otherwise, that would have been an incredibly stupid thing to say to a journalist, wouldn't it?

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.500
 But what was...

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.500
 Well, you've taken a lot of cocaine, you do talk a lot.

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:49.500
 And you talk about yourself, don't you?

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:50.500
 Why do I think I'm doing so?

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:51.500
 Well, let me tell you this.

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:58.500
 The writers were fine for being pushed along by spectators.

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.500
 You would get a clandestine push along as you went along.

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:04.500
 And I can't imagine that did you a huge amount of good, unless they ran with you pushing you for a bit.

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:04.500
 Yeah.

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.500
 You get pushing in the Tour de France now.

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:07.500
 You do.

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:08.500
 Just what a supportive push.

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:10.500
 So not by the crowd normally.

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:13.500
 So let's say your bicycle breaks, and you need to get a new one.

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.500
 But you're on an uphill bit.

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:18.500
 Then your mechanic will give you a push up the hill while you're going.

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:19.500
 Is that a rush?

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:20.500
 It's kind of allowed, yeah.

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:21.500
 As long as you don't do it too much.

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:22.500
 Okay.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:25.500
 The other one is, well, like you might be getting a drink from the car.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.500
 And they will hand you the drink.

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.500
 So hold on to it for like 10 seconds.

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:31.500
 So they're pulling you along on the car, and then you take it up them.

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:32.500
 That happens so funny.

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:33.500
 In every race.

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:38.500
 It's on their house sort of a second limit, don't they, on when you really had to have to let go now.

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:41.500
 Just on the topic of drugs being not a cheating.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:49.500
 So even though you weren't sort of disqualified for doing drugs, there was a lot of cheating that happened right on the very first Tour de France that ever happened.

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:56.500
 So there was the favourite who was who was said to be the greatest cyclist who was going to win whose name I just can't pronounce.

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:57.500
 So I'm going to pretend we're made.

00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.500
 So I'm just going to call them a nickname hippo.

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:06.500
 He actually had to bow out halfway through the very first one because he drank some lemonade from a crowd member, had a sip.

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:10.500
 And then he had this huge indigestion, huge stomach problems, and thought he was poisoned.

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:14.500
 No one believed him, and they thought he was just a bit weak and he wasn't as good as he was.

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:20.500
 And it wasn't for years later that they actually traced it down and worked out it was in fact a spiked bit of lemonade.

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:21.500
 And so he...

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:22.500
 How would you work that out?

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:23.500
 I know.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.500
 I don't need evidence must have gone by that.

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:27.500
 I know. I have no idea.

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:28.500
 Maybe like...

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:30.500
 Maybe like two years later this lemonade has really gone on.

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:33.500
 Only got sick.

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:35.500
 Which one, which Charm Tour is this?

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:36.500
 This was the very first one.

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:43.500
 So this was in 1903, but then he came back in 1904 and he then himself then became the cheater.

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:51.500
 Because what he did was he was being towed by a car by using a sort of invisible string attached to a cork.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.500
 He had the cork in between his teeth.

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:55.500
 Why is teeth? Why don't I just hold the cork?

00:17:55.500 --> 00:18:01.500
 He was pulled by the mouth, towed by the mouth, and he was caught.

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:08.500
 But in that race, a total of 29 people, I think were disqualified largely for illegal use of cars and frames.

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:09.500
 They kept on...

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:14.500
 And even the guy, the four people who came first, second, third and fourth were disqualified.

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:17.500
 And so the guy who was fifth, Henry Cornett, ended up winning.

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:21.500
 But even he had used a car for a bit of it and got a warning.

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.500
 He didn't use the car as badly as the others.

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:29.500
 But there was another guy who, one of the main guys, there was some contaminated food that he was given,

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:32.500
 which was a chicken leg containing a sleeping pill.

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:36.500
 And that meant that he fell off his bike because he fell asleep on his bike.

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:43.500
 There was a thing about how badly all the teams behaved during the early tours.

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:47.500
 So this is from a book called Tour de France, A Cultural History by Christopher Thompson.

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:50.500
 I've read a bit of it. It's very good, very funny.

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:58.500
 In the 1920s, hotels complained that cyclists were using curtains in their rooms to wipe Vaseline off themselves after massages.

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:00.500
 And it would just horribly behaved all the way around the tour.

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:02.500
 Are you not allowed to do that if you're in a hotel?

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:05.500
 What, using the curtains to wipe Vaseline off yourself?

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:07.500
 Didn't have towels.

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.500
 I think they just do it to be rock and roll.

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.500
 I don't know what I'm talking about.

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:14.500
 Shall we throw this TV out of the window?

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.500
 No, I can't. I can't grip on it.

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:22.500
 So it hasn't been invented yet.

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:28.500
 But they kept stealing things as well as they would cycle through towns.

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.500
 They would just swipe glasses of wine and baguettes off tables as they went.

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:33.500
 So all the pubs would close.

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:39.500
 Whenever the tour was coming through, the pubs would close because they knew that the tour would just everyone get off the bike at the same time,

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.500
 and then go on in, steal all the wine, and then go off again.

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:48.500
 Well, the guy who won the second Tour de France, Maurice Garin,

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:50.500
 who himself was then caught for cheating.

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:51.500
 He was also part of the cheating.

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:55.500
 He was doing things like putting itching powder down the trousers of other contestants.

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.500
 I like that kind of cheating.

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:02.500
 If they did that kind of cheating these days rather than injecting steroids and stuff, I think that would be more fun.

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:03.500
 Yeah, definitely.

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:08.500
 Like, whoopee cushions and... You know, like, it doesn't slow you down there or whoopee cushion on a bike.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:12.500
 The worst that happens is a bit of a fart as you said off, which would probably help you, actually,

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.500
 if the whoopee cushion is the right way around.

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:16.500
 I would put the whoopee cushion the other way around.

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:18.500
 Oh, yes, it blasts you back down the mountain.

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:19.500
 Yeah, I see.

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:21.500
 Yeah, a very powerful whoopee cushion.

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:24.500
 I would just suggest upturn nails on the roads.

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:25.500
 That's harsh, though.

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:30.500
 What about covering an entire road in those plastic dirty fire days so the cyclists have to go around them all?

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:31.500
 What's a dirty fire day?

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:32.500
 Oh, come on over.

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:33.500
 That's a bad dog.

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:34.500
 A fake plastic dog poo.

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:35.500
 Oh, yeah.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:40.500
 I'm taking a purely of Smithy's joke shop level pranks that you could put.

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:41.500
 I don't like that.

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:42.500
 All of those, right, isn't it?

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:43.500
 The Smithy's joke shop.

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:45.500
 Like, you could put, like, a little hand buzzer on their handlebars.

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:46.500
 100%.

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:52.500
 Or, like, the guy in the leads got, like, a fake black eye because he's like, "Let's get a telescope."

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:57.500
 The old classic often have some gum.

00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:58.500
 No, it's a mouse trap, though.

00:20:58.500 --> 00:20:59.500
 Yeah.

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:00.500
 You won't be cycling for hours after that.

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:01.500
 This sore finger.

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:06.500
 This is the way to get people watching the Tour de France together.

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:07.500
 Right.

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:08.500
 This is Doping People Get on board with.

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:13.500
 Oh, and I see the rest of the pelas sort of cycled into the crudely drawn on tunnel on the side of the road.

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:21.500
 You weren't in the middle of saying something, Dan.

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:22.500
 Oh, yeah.

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:23.500
 Yeah.

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.500
 I was about Morris Garret.

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:26.500
 It turned out to.

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:27.500
 That's right.

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:28.500
 No.

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:29.500
 He was the guy who was beaten up.

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:30.500
 Yeah.

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:31.500
 Really, okay.

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:32.500
 Yeah.

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:37.500
 So, he, he, not in the Tour de France, but he once won a 24-hour race.

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:41.500
 And he credited the win to this amount of stuff that he was eating and drinking along the way.

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:45.500
 So, we were talking about the fact they would stop off and drink wine and steal baguettes and stuff like that.

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:53.500
 The list that he said that he ate and drank during that 24-hour race was he had lots of red wine, eight cooked eggs, 19 liters of hot chocolate,

00:21:53.500 --> 00:22:00.500
 a mixture of coffee and champagne, two kilograms of rice, seven liters of tea, 45 chicken cutlets and oysters.

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:01.500
 It's 45 chicken cutlets.

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:02.500
 Yeah.

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:05.500
 It's still stuck with the 19 liters of hot chocolate.

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:06.500
 Wait, well, that's in how long?

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:07.500
 24 hours.

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:09.500
 There was a 24-hour race that he did.

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:10.500
 Yeah, 19 liters.

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:12.500
 No, wait, one nine, one nine liters.

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:13.500
 Yeah.

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:14.500
 There's not time.

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:17.500
 And also, you have to leave hot chocolate for about 12 minutes to cool down.

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:18.500
 So, you don't burn your mouth.

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:19.500
 That's true.

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:20.500
 Yeah.

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:23.500
 No, they do drink chocolate milk in the Tour de France now.

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:24.500
 All of the teams do that.

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:25.500
 It's amazing.

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:27.500
 I occasionally go cycling and chocolate milk.

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:29.500
 It's just going straight to your legs.

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:30.500
 Yeah.

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:31.500
 It's like when Popeye has a spinach.

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:32.500
 Oh, cool.

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:33.500
 That would have been a very bad health message though.

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:34.500
 Wow.

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:35.500
 I'm going to go and get some chocolate milk.

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.500
 Was there another thing he used to do?

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:38.500
 It was smoke cigarettes.

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:41.500
 And that's what a lot of the cyclists used to do as well.

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:42.500
 And you can see these great photos.

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:44.500
 Was it like an exploding cigar?

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:51.500
 What they used to do was, as they were approaching a massive hill, if they were in a group and they

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:55.500
 were with their team, they would all light up a cigarette or light one up and pass it around.

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:56.500
 So, you can see photos are showing it.

00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:01.500
 What they thought was is that it was opening up your lungs so that you could climb the hill.

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:03.500
 Wow, that is really not what happens.

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:04.500
 Yeah.

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:05.500
 So I see opposite.

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:08.500
 Although the smoke could obscure the vision of the people behind you.

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:09.500
 It's true.

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:10.500
 Working away.

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:11.500
 Yeah.

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:15.500
 So Bernard, well, it's clearly a French guy, so it's probably something like Bernard Inneult.

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:18.500
 But I'm going to say Bernard Hinult.

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:23.500
 And he was cycling winning in the 80s and he had a champagne before he cycled up the last hill

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:24.500
 and won.

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:26.500
 Which I quite like the people were still doing it up until...

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:33.500
 Actually, I think these days I have a memory of the winners kind of going down in Paris having

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:34.500
 a glass of champagne.

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:35.500
 I think that just happened.

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:36.500
 Cool.

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:38.500
 Because the final race is usually a bit of a procession.

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:43.500
 If you're winning in the penultimate race, they will never overtake you in the last race.

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:46.500
 It's always like just a kind of a procession to Paris.

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:49.500
 I'm pretty sure they have gone with champagne.

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:50.500
 Can you?

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:51.500
 Fair enough.

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:54.500
 Can you explain this, then James, because you do know it well.

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:58.500
 So apparently there's a gentleman's agreement in the Tour de France that you can take pause

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:04.500
 pipi, which are basically potty breaks, to stop, have a wee, get back on your bike.

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:08.500
 Other people who are trying to beat you, kind of have an understanding that they won't try and overtake you at that moment.

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:09.500
 Yeah, that is true.

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:16.500
 The fact is, you're on the road for hours and hours and hours on end and you're taking in lots of chocolate milk or, you know, whatever.

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:19.500
 And so you do need to stop and it's just like a...

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:20.500
 It's a hard luck.

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:21.500
 You get overtaken.

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:23.500
 It doesn't make sense because then you won't attack.

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:24.500
 You won't get attacked yourself.

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:27.500
 But the chivalry in cycling is quite good.

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:33.500
 Like even for instance, if you're at the top, if you're in the lead and let's say there's a crash and it's not really your fault.

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:35.500
 Quite often the others won't wait for you.

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:39.500
 Because they want to beat you just by being better than you, not because of being a bad luck or whatever.

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:42.500
 And through massive injections of band substance.

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:46.500
 That's what chivalry is.

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:53.500
 Sir Lancelot found a crease in his armour and it stabbed a massive syringe in it.

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:04.500
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Andy.

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:09.500
 My vector is that in the 19th century, setting type for newspapers was a competitive sport.

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:10.500
 Oh my god.

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:11.500
 It's so exciting.

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:13.500
 This was before they had the Tour de France.

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:16.500
 So you had to find their own entertainment somehow.

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:21.500
 So setting type for newspapers is where you would have a massive bank of letters in front of you.

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:25.500
 And they're all the moulds that you're using in a newspaper and you have to pluck them out by hand.

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:28.500
 You say, "Oh, we need a small one and then we need a big F and then we need a small G."

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.500
 So what word is that?

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:31.500
 We're spending F good.

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:35.500
 And obviously you need all different parts.

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:40.500
 It's amazing, sorry, that when you were trying to come up with a random series of letters, you listed E F and G, isn't it?

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:46.500
 I don't know where my imagination comes from, but it's a gift.

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:52.500
 So basically, you're writing out all the words that a newspaper needs to do, but you're doing it in physical blocks.

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:53.500
 Yeah, exactly.

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:56.500
 And then the printing press comes down and prints the newspaper.

00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:57.500
 Yeah, exactly.

00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:59.500
 So you make a full page of type.

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:03.500
 And it's incredibly hard physical work and there's so much of it to do.

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:07.500
 And this was pre-mechanized type setting.

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:09.500
 And it turned into a sport.

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:14.500
 And type setters would turn up a compete against each other to audiences of hundreds or thousands as well.

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:20.500
 There were prizes of about $1,000, which was six months salary for a type setter at the time, which is pretty good.

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:25.500
 And they were judged on speed, so they were given a set passage to type set.

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:31.500
 But then afterwards, there had to be proofreaders who would assess them for mistakes they'd made in their type setting as well.

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:33.500
 Was there a competitive proofreading as well?

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:36.500
 How would you do competitive proofreading? You'd have to have more proofreaders.

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:40.500
 And then you're in a never-ending loop of competition now.

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:43.500
 But being a type setter was a pretty shit job, wasn't it?

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:44.500
 It was very tough.

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:45.500
 Yeah.

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:49.500
 You would work from 1 p.m. to 4 a.m. every day.

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:54.500
 The ventilation and the fumes and everything were so bad that the average life expectancy

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:57.500
 in 1850 was 28 years of a type setter.

00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:58.500
 Wow.

00:26:58.500 --> 00:26:59.500
 Yeah.

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:00.500
 Yeah, that's rough.

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:04.500
 Although, there were kind of quite cool little details about doing it.

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:10.500
 So one of them is the origin of uppercase and lowercase is that they would keep all the different types in separate drawers.

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.500
 For each font, you'd have two drawers.

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:18.500
 And the uppercase, or the uppercase, was the one full of capital letters in the lowercase, was the lowercase.

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:19.500
 It's quite nice.

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:25.500
 There's loads of words, isn't there? That's what you see when you go on the internet and you google type setting facts.

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:28.500
 It's always like the word "cleashay" comes from type setting.

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:29.500
 I don't know that one.

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:34.500
 If you've used up all your type, then you can't use it for anything else.

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:37.500
 So what you did was you used up all your type and then you made a mold out of it.

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:39.500
 And then you printed everything with that mold.

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:42.500
 And that mold was called the "cleashay" or the "stereotype".

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:51.500
 But something pointed out to me that "cleashay" is an onomatopoeia because "cleashay" was actually the sound of the mold as it hit the molten metal.

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:52.500
 Oh, what's it?

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:54.500
 Wait, what are you using the mold for?

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:57.500
 So basically, you've done your type and you want to do a second page.

00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:59.500
 So you have to reuse all of these blocks.

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:00.500
 Is this right?

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:00.500
 Yeah.

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:04.500
 And so what you do is you take a mold of it and then you can reuse the blocks for the next page.

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:05.500
 Oh, I see.

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:07.500
 And that's your "cleashay" or your "stereotype".

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:12.500
 And I think "cleashay" was used for images and "stereotype" was used for type.

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:13.500
 Oh, cool.

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:16.500
 But yeah, "cleashay" the sound that molten lead makes.

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:17.500
 That's very cool.

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:18.500
 They needed so much of it as well.

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:22.500
 So a single newspaper needed about 50 to 100 hours of type setting.

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:24.500
 And this is going very fast as well.

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:26.500
 This is sometimes they would do two things per second.

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:29.500
 You're constantly going back and forth to the cases.

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:31.500
 And it's all upside down and back to front as well.

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:33.500
 There's another complication with the crate.

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:34.500
 Yeah.

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:39.500
 But as these conversations were happening, this was kind of a dying game

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:42.500
 because it was replaced by a linear type or a liner type.

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:44.500
 So it came from a line of type, a liner type.

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:46.500
 You would press a keyboard.

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:47.500
 You would just give it a keyboard.

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.500
 And then as you pressed, you know, lowercase h,

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:51.500
 an individual letter would slide into place.

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:55.500
 And then when the line was finished and the operator would release some boiling lead,

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:59.500
 and that would make a single stick of metal for that whole line of type.

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:01.500
 So that became a much faster way of doing it.

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:04.500
 And then that was replaced by computerized type setting.

00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:08.500
 And when that happened, the Guardian had a mock funeral

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:10.500
 for the old printing process.

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:11.500
 Really?

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:13.500
 Yeah, this was in 1987.

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:14.500
 Wow.

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:16.500
 The printing union, they had a miniature coffin.

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:21.500
 And the coffin has a plate on it, saying R.O.P. the Guardian 1961 to 1987.

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:25.500
 And there were printers dressed as poor bearers in top hats and black tie.

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:27.500
 And there was a saxophone player.

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:28.500
 I have not worked out why.

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.500
 I think because it was 1987.

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:35.500
 And that coffin, the mini coffin commemorating a Lennartype printing,

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:37.500
 is now in the Guardian's archive.

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:38.500
 Really?

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:39.500
 Wow.

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:40.500
 So cool.

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.500
 Well, I like as well that when you read the characters and the stories,

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:45.500
 they're often associated with a font that you know really well.

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:48.500
 So like John Baskerville, for example,

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:51.500
 he's famous as a typographer, but he also created this font.

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:53.500
 So we have that today.

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:55.500
 I think it was killed by that dog, so sad.

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:56.500
 Yeah.

00:29:56.500 --> 00:30:02.500
 There's a guy called William Caslan, I quite like as well.

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:05.500
 He invented a typeface that was used on the Declaration of Independence.

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:07.500
 And he was a British guy.

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:08.500
 So quite like it's a British font, something.

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:09.500
 Was it good?

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:11.500
 Was he called William Caslan?

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:12.500
 So I don't...

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:13.500
 Caslan.

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:14.500
 Yeah, I haven't heard of that.

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:15.500
 I don't think he made it into...

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:16.500
 There were loads of those guys.

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:18.500
 There was John Helvetica.

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:19.500
 Jeremiah Wingdings.

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:20.500
 Yep.

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:22.500
 More Arthur Comic Sounds.

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:29.500
 Don't allow a name, of course, very posh.

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:32.500
 So when all these new innovations come along,

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:34.500
 people were often afraid it was going to put them out of work.

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:37.500
 So for instance, typesetters, not really a thing anymore,

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:38.500
 because we don't need them.

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:41.500
 And similarly, as the printing press got better and better,

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:43.500
 and more automated, it needed fewer workers.

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:46.500
 And one of the major advances in the printing press

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:49.500
 was the steam printing press, so it could get run by steam.

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:52.500
 This is invented in the early 1800s.

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:54.500
 And the first place it was used was on the Times.

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:57.500
 And the Times has managed by a guy called John Walter.

00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:00.500
 And he heard about this steam printing press invention.

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:02.500
 And he thought, I better introduce this into my factory

00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:04.500
 because it seems amazing, and it can do so much printing.

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:07.500
 But I can't tell the workers because they'll get really annoyed

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:09.500
 because it was like the age of luddism

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:11.500
 and workers fearing their jobs would be lost.

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:15.500
 So overnight, he secretly installed this steam printing press.

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:18.500
 He printed all of the day's papers overnight.

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:20.500
 And all the workers arrived at work the next day,

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:22.500
 and he announced to them that their jobs were narrowed down

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:23.500
 and because he'd already done the paper.

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:26.500
 I gave them a newspaper with the headline, "You're all fine."

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:31.500
 That is so weird, Anna, because did you say that was the Times?

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:32.500
 Yeah.

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:34.500
 So that is literally exactly what happened in the 80s

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:36.500
 with Rupert Murdoch at the Times.

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:37.500
 What?

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:39.500
 Yeah, genuinely, because the printing unions had mass...

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:42.500
 There were big industrial disputes with the printing unions.

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:43.500
 They were constantly going on strike.

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:45.500
 They were extremely well paid.

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:48.500
 And Murdoch wanted to smash the unions.

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:50.500
 So he had an entirely new newspaper printing plant

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:53.500
 set up in whopping outside Fleet Street,

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:55.500
 set up all the computers there in secret.

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:57.500
 And then bang, overnight, move there,

00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:58.500
 and move the Times there.

00:31:58.500 --> 00:31:59.500
 Yeah.

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:01.500
 And a stroke took away the power of the printing unions,

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:03.500
 which has not been the same sense.

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:05.500
 I was looking into Victorian newspapers,

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:07.500
 and I found an account of a guy called @DigieVictorian,

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:10.500
 Dr. Bob Nicholson is his name.

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:13.500
 And he wrote a series of really fun tweets,

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:16.500
 which is, he said he'd just watched the new Dickens movie,

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:19.500
 and he's not usually bothered by inaccuracies in historical dramas.

00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:21.500
 But politely requesting,

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:24.500
 stop putting massive headlines on Victorian newspapers,

00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:26.500
 picture of it's saying Dickens,

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:29.500
 and it's a headline that Dickens is holding.

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:31.500
 That's a terrible headline as well.

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:33.500
 That's what he's done.

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:34.500
 Yeah.

00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:35.500
 It doesn't tell you anything.

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:36.500
 That's what I mean.

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:38.500
 If he'd put his dick into...

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:40.500
 That's quite a good pun, actually.

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:42.500
 There were a few more lines on it.

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:44.500
 I mean, if it was called what's the dick in,

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:46.500
 then I would be interested,

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:48.500
 because that's just pun on what the dickens.

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:50.500
 That would be a tabloid, you know, doing it.

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:51.500
 Yeah, that is good.

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:53.500
 Dickens puts dick in chicken.

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:54.500
 We'll be over there.

00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:58.500
 Sorry, Dan, you were talking about a new set of headlines.

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:00.500
 There was more to the headline.

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:01.500
 It might have been...

00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:02.500
 Yeah.

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:04.500
 It might have been Dickens puts dick in chicken.

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:06.500
 I haven't seen the new movie, but...

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:08.500
 It could very well be that.

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:11.500
 And his point being that no newspapers back in Victorian times

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:12.500
 carried headlines.

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:13.500
 Not only did they not carry headlines,

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:14.500
 they didn't even carry news stories.

00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:16.500
 All they carried was adverts.

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.500
 The whole of the front page of all newspapers,

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:20.500
 or at least most of the newspapers back then,

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:22.500
 were densely packed with adverts.

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.500
 And when you think about the printing process,

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:26.500
 and you'll see a picture of it, it's tiny.

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:28.500
 It's so tiny, just saying how is that possible?

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:31.500
 Wait, but you said, I mean, they did have news stories in the newspaper.

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:32.500
 In the newspaper, but not on the covers.

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:33.500
 Yeah, yeah.

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:34.500
 So no headlines would ever appear there,

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:36.500
 but not even news would appear there.

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:37.500
 That was never the thing.

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:38.500
 It was just purely adverts.

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:39.500
 Which I didn't know.

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:42.500
 But there was so many personal adverts as well.

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:44.500
 It was, you know, the Facebook, the Craigslist,

00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:45.500
 the everything of its day.

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:47.500
 It was just the weather community.

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:48.500
 Yeah.

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:49.500
 You exchanged all of its news and said,

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:51.500
 "You know, has anyone seen my check-in?"

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:52.500
 Yeah.

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:54.500
 The tickets were hanging around the cake last night.

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:55.500
 I don't know where it's gone.

00:33:55.500 --> 00:34:03.500
 Okay, it is time for our final factor, the show,

00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:05.500
 and that is James.

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:08.500
 Okay, my fact this week is that Britain exports fresh air

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:09.500
 to China.

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:10.500
 Very good.

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:13.500
 That's how we're going to get through Brexit guys.

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:16.500
 We'll all be as fixating in five years,

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:19.500
 so I can sold all the air.

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:23.500
 So basically, this is a thing which started off as a joke,

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:25.500
 and everyone would just kind of get fresh air

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:28.500
 from different countries and put it in jars and sell it to people.

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:31.500
 But more recently, it's become kind of a thing,

00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:33.500
 and people in China like to get these jars of air,

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:36.500
 and obviously the pollution is terrible in China.

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:40.500
 And there's a firm called Ether, I think, or Ether Air,

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:42.500
 and they collect air from the UK countryside

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:44.500
 and sell it for £80 a jar.

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:48.500
 And it began as an environmental political artwork.

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:50.500
 But now they say, at the end of the day,

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:53.500
 we're a company selling fresh air to people who can afford it,

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:56.500
 and anti-pollution face masks to those who can't.

00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:59.500
 Because they reinvest the money, don't they, in the face masks?

00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:00.500
 That's right, yeah.

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:02.500
 It was really confusing when it was first set up,

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:04.500
 because I remember it was about two years ago

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:07.500
 when that guy Leo DeWatt's first set up that company.

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:11.500
 - Leo DeWatt? - It's a dad joke.

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:14.500
 But it's so weird, you should watch.

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:18.500
 Look up on YouTube, the YouTube video of his team.

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:20.500
 So there are these two really posh women.

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.500
 And it's never openly stated anywhere that it's a spoof,

00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:24.500
 but it so obviously is.

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:26.500
 And you can see the comments below getting.

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:28.500
 So agitated about how stupid they are.

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:30.500
 These two women absolutely taking the piss,

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:31.500
 and they've been really funny.

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:34.500
 So they prance around the countryside with these nets,

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:36.500
 just leaping about, netting air,

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:38.500
 and then they go up to a little jar,

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:40.500
 and then they thrust the net into the jar.

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:42.500
 And they talk about it, so there's one woman who says,

00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:44.500
 "The wind might pick up notes of grass,

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:46.500
 or if you're near the sea, some saltiness,

00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:48.500
 and then at the end, they have about five jars."

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:50.500
 And they say, "There's today's harvest."

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:52.500
 If they're only getting five a day,

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:54.500
 it's no 180 pounds of pop.

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:55.500
 - That's true. - Yeah.

00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:56.500
 Yeah.

00:35:56.500 --> 00:36:03.500
 It's more yield.

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:05.500
 Sean Aaron, who's a director of the Canadian Respiratory Research Network,

00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:07.500
 says, "This is unlikely to provide any health benefits.

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:10.500
 Clean air bottles is a gimmick, a waste of money."

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:14.500
 So if you're listening, don't pay 80 pounds for fresh air.

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:16.500
 Unless you're very wealthy.

00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:17.500
 Yeah.

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:20.500
 You know, we just don't tell people how to spend their money.

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:22.500
 No, it's, yeah, obviously.

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:24.500
 You don't get rich in the first place

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:26.500
 if you're spending money on fresh air.

00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:27.500
 No, that's true.

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:29.500
 But if you're selling it, you might do.

00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:30.500
 Yeah.

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:31.500
 One of the things I found out from this,

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:34.500
 just because it was about China's problem with air pollution,

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:37.500
 China's taking massive steps to deal with now,

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:38.500
 is that, um,

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:41.500
 Beijing is now on its 13th five-year plan.

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:43.500
 Did you know there are still five-year plans going?

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:44.500
 No, I didn't know.

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:45.500
 Oh, no.

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:46.500
 Yeah.

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:48.500
 Hang on, and it's actually done all 13 of them all the way through,

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:50.500
 because Stalin didn't even get through his first one.

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:51.500
 I think once you get to the end of the five years,

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:52.500
 that's it.

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:53.500
 You've just finished the five-year plan.

00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:55.500
 Yeah, whether you actually get what you planned on,

00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:56.500
 not exactly.

00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:57.500
 Exactly, it's over.

00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:58.500
 You just have to have another plan.

00:36:58.500 --> 00:36:59.500
 Right.

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:01.500
 You can't extend the five-year plan to be a six-year plan.

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:02.500
 Okay.

00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:03.500
 You just started the five-year plan.

00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:06.500
 Are you just saying that China's been around for 65 years?

00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:07.500
 Yeah.

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:08.500
 Oh, yeah.

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:11.500
 No, but they've had a new five-year plan every five years.

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:13.500
 It's the thing they keep, they've kept doing.

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:14.500
 Is it?

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:15.500
 And it's paying off.

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:16.500
 Yeah, they're doing okay, aren't they?

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:17.500
 Yeah.

00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:18.500
 Not on a pollution level.

00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:19.500
 No.

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:21.500
 But it gets called the air pocket lips.

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:22.500
 Yes.

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:24.500
 But surely it doesn't work in Chinese.

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:25.500
 In Mandarin, does it?

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:26.500
 Can't do.

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:28.500
 So why do they call it that?

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:30.500
 Maybe it's us who calls it that.

00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:32.500
 I don't know.

00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:34.500
 There's a hotel called the Cordes Honkiao,

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:35.500
 which has filters.

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:39.500
 It filters all the air going into the hotel.

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:40.500
 Like an airplane.

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:42.500
 All the windows are closed all the time.

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:44.500
 And the air quality is 10 times better indoors.

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:47.500
 So the hotel claims than it is outdoors.

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:50.500
 But yeah, it has to pass through two intensive filtering layers.

00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:51.500
 It's not crazy.

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:52.500
 Yeah.

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:54.500
 Because that's not a way of, you can't do that for everybody.

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:55.500
 No.

00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:56.500
 No.

00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:57.500
 No.

00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:58.500
 You could get a little helmet, though.

00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:01.500
 Like, there has been a push chair that's been developed for babies,

00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:02.500
 which is basically that.

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:04.500
 But this is called the air shield.

00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:09.500
 And it's a thing that creates a clean air microclimate inside a baby's push chair.

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:11.500
 Why are those babies getting all the good stuff?

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:14.500
 Because they're innocent, James, unlike you.

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:15.500
 What have you heard?

00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:20.500
 What I was saying is that technology surely can be slightly increased

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:22.500
 in size for people like me.

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:24.500
 Why do you want to be pushed down to the push chair?

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:25.500
 That's crazy, James.

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:27.500
 Look, you can't tell me what to do with my money.

00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:31.500
 It doesn't go big enough for adult heads.

00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:33.500
 It can only, no, I don't know.

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:34.500
 It's quite expensive at the moment, I think.

00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:36.500
 But it is quite cool.

00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:37.500
 It looks like an alien pod.

00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:39.500
 And it's got a glass lid that protects them from UV rays.

00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:42.500
 And then it's got a little speaker installed inside it,

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:44.500
 so the parent can chat to the baby still.

00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:52.500
 But baby's famously produced quite bad smells.

00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:57.500
 So Julia, there's a risk that you're locking them in with their own farts.

00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:00.500
 You don't just leave them in there for five years.

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:04.500
 But yeah, it's a real, very major problem, isn't it?

00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:06.500
 Bad air quality in the world.

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:09.500
 And I think people are now trying to make face masks a bit trendy.

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:11.500
 Because we're used to seeing face masks.

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:12.500
 They all look the same, don't they?

00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:13.500
 I guess they're black or white.

00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:18.500
 But they've, because there are startups in China and in the US and in the UK

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:22.500
 that are designing pollution masks for up to $100 at the moment,

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:23.500
 but to try and make them cool.

00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:25.500
 Can you get them to look like your own face,

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:27.500
 so that no one knows you're wearing one of the masks?

00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:30.500
 I think you could put like a mustache on there.

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:31.500
 Yeah.

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:33.500
 And then you can see if you look good in the beard and mustache.

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:34.500
 That's what it is.

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:35.500
 That's what it is.

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:37.500
 That's what it is.

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:39.500
 Do they do extending face masks,

00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:41.500
 which can cover the breast area?

00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:44.500
 Or the penis area, actually.

00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:46.500
 So you could just try it out.

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:47.500
 You know this thing about,

00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:50.500
 if you breathe in a lungful of air,

00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:53.500
 it'll contain some of Caesar's breath.

00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:55.500
 There have been calculations done on this.

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:58.500
 And so the idea is he breathed out some molecules.

00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:02.500
 There's enough of them in all of the air that one of them will get into your breath, right?

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:03.500
 Exactly.

00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:07.500
 I always thought it was when he died, his atoms or water in the air,

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:09.500
 and that's what you're breathing in.

00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:11.500
 So there's another thing like that.

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:15.500
 Or there will be the carbon that makes up his body might be in carbon dioxide.

00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:19.500
 So there's a book called Caesar's Last Breath by an author called Sam Keen.

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:24.500
 And he says that every breath has about 25 sextillion gas molecules.

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:26.500
 So given the number of breath you take over your life,

00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:31.500
 the odds are that there will be a Caesar particle in any breath you take.

00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:33.500
 What about every move you make?

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:34.500
 Yeah.

00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:36.500
 He'll be watching you.

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.500
 So I took it a bit further.

00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:42.500
 I looked up how much you fart every day.

00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:45.500
 And you fart about three pints a day.

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:46.500
 Three pints.

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:47.500
 Three pints.

00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:49.500
 Yeah, but gas is kind of spread out, isn't it?

00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:50.500
 Oh, yes.

00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:52.500
 It's not like if you squash it down to a liquid, it would be a pint.

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:53.500
 Yes, okay, right.

00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:54.500
 Yeah.

00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:58.500
 So I think I'm right in working this out of that at least twice a day

00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:01.500
 you will breathe in a molecule that Caesar farted out.

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:02.500
 Cool.

00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:04.500
 I might be wrong on the maths.

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:05.500
 Wow.

00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:10.500
 So there's a company, or there was a company in 2016 that sold shortage air

00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:13.500
 from the shortage area of London, which is super trendy.

00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:14.500
 Yeah.

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:15.500
 Yeah.

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:19.500
 It was 1999 each, so cheaper than the stuff that they were sending to China.

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:20.500
 Yeah, that's good.

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:25.500
 You can either get shortage AM, which contains the notes of the night before,

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:29.500
 or shortage PM, which smells of rolled tobacco cigarettes,

00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:32.500
 pseudo-philosophy and hemp brewed beer.

00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:37.500
 I think I might pay the 80 quid, actually, for the more expensive stuff.

00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:39.500
 My family used to have a can of air.

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:40.500
 Did they?

00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:41.500
 Yeah.

00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:42.500
 We use a fire extinguisher down.

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:43.500
 It's completely different.

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:48.500
 Dan comes in with his mouth wrapped around the fire extinguisher in the morning.

00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:50.500
 And then when that fire came, wasn't funny anymore?

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:51.500
 Was it?

00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:52.500
 What's happened to the big can of air?

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:53.500
 Dan drank it.

00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:59.500
 Just for anyone listening, I know a fire extinguisher is not a can of air.

00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:03.500
 All right, I know there's more complicated than that.

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:06.500
 If you blasted an air on a fire, wouldn't it make the fire bigger?

00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:09.500
 Oxygen, that would be, but there is, you know.

00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:10.500
 Yeah.

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:11.500
 It's foam, isn't it?

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:12.500
 For what does air contain?

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:13.500
 Oxygen.

00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:14.500
 Yeah.

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:15.500
 Balsy nitrogen.

00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:16.500
 Anyway, look.

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:17.500
 And you get nitrogen with the fire extinguisher, isn't it?

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:18.500
 That's cool.

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:22.500
 In fact, we said before that packets of crisps are full of nitrogen, not oxygen.

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:25.500
 Oh, not air, rather, so that the crisps don't go off.

00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:29.500
 Could you theoretically put a fire out by opening a massive bag of crisps near it?

00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:30.500
 Yes.

00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:31.500
 Excellent.

00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:34.500
 Anything that displaces the oxygen would do it.

00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:36.500
 Well, I know what I'm going on, Tragan Stenberg.

00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:37.500
 That's amazing.

00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:40.500
 This is a bag of crisps with a size of a house.

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:43.500
 Just put open it slowly and put the bag over the fire.

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:44.500
 And it's out.

00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:47.500
 If you put it over the fire, then you've wasted the crisps, aren't you?

00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:48.500
 Oh, no, they're nicely chargrilled.

00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:51.500
 Actually, these crisps are just potato out there.

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:52.500
 They've not been cooked.

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:53.500
 Yes.

00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:55.500
 And the writer's covering oil.

00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:56.500
 Wow.

00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:57.500
 Oh.

00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:59.500
 This is the best idea anyway.

00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:03.500
 Is this why we never hear about a fire and a walker's crisps factory?

00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:06.500
 Sorry, Dan, I completely interrupted.

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:09.500
 It's pre-1997 hand over Hong Kong air is what we had.

00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:16.500
 So what they did in Hong Kong was they can't pre the British air, as it were, in Hong Kong.

00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:17.500
 Wow.

00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:21.500
 During the hand over lots of parties, that was their present to a lot of people that went to them.

00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:23.500
 Every year, as we had this can in the house, I don't know where it's gone.

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:24.500
 Wow.

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:25.500
 Yeah.

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:26.500
 Oh, cool.

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:28.500
 Yeah. I have one last thing, which is the band kiss.

00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:31.500
 If we're talking about selling air, they sell.

00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:34.500
 And they are making a lot of money off, you know, air guitar.

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:35.500
 Yeah.

00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:37.500
 They sell strings for your air guitar.

00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:38.500
 No way.

00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:39.500
 Yeah.

00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:40.500
 And they package it up.

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:45.500
 And they have a little, you know, like if you were buying something from a joke shop, it's got that little label.

00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:48.500
 It says guaranteed strong strings or whatever.

00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:53.500
 Yeah, it's kiss and they're making so much money off it when people go to their stores, which they have in America.

00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:54.500
 Yeah.

00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:55.500
 And it's just a really good idea.

00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:58.500
 It's a great, yeah, it's a great novelty idea, but they're making millions of selling air.

00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:00.500
 It's what the article is saying.

00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:01.500
 Yeah.

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:02.500
 Yeah.

00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:07.500
 Okay, that's it.

00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:08.500
 That is all of our facts.

00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:09.500
