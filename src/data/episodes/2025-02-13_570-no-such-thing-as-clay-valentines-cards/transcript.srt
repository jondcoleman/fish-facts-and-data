00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
 - Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,220
 We've got a very exciting one for you today.

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:08,960
 It is our Valentine's Day special.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,380
 So yeah, we've collected together some of the sexiest,

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:13,820
 most romantic facts that we could possibly find

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,380
 for your listening pleasure.

7
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:16,420
 And we'll be getting to that

8
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,700
 over the course of this episode.

9
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,380
 However, before we get into that,

10
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,580
 I've just got a quick announcement,

11
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,020
 which is that we have a live show coming up

12
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:27,820
 in July at the Crossed Wires Festival podcast in Sheffield.

13
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,060
 So the Crossed Wires podcast festival is fantastic.

14
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,340
 It debuted last year.

15
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,020
 It was co-created by our good buddy, Alice Levine,

16
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,460
 from My Dad Wrote a Porno,

17
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,500
 and they are back this year for round two.

18
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,100
 And really excitingly, she has invited us to be part of it.

19
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,660
 So we will be there to record a live episode

20
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,780
 at the City Hall on the 6th of July at 2PM.

21
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,180
 And if you wanna come along,

22
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:52,980
 you just need to head to knowsuchthingasafish.com/live

23
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,300
 to get your tickets right now.

24
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,780
 It's gonna be great fun.

25
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,820
 As I say, a live podcast recording

26
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:01,020
 with a bunch of silly extra bits thrown in as well.

27
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,100
 And if you get a chance,

28
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,060
 why not head over to the crossedwires.live website as well.

29
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,020
 That's the address.

30
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,220
 So many great shows are gonna be there this year.

31
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,300
 It's so awesome that these podcast festivals

32
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,060
 are erupting around the UK.

33
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,180
 Do support them and do come see us.

34
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,380
 We'd love to see you there.

35
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,540
 All right, well, let's get into this week's episode.

36
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,380
 It is our Valentine's Day special.

37
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:24,340
 Enjoy our sexy, sexy facts on with the show.

38
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,620
 (upbeat music)

39
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:39,180
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

40
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,980
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

41
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,580
 a weekly podcast coming to you

42
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,900
 from the QI offices in Hoburn.

43
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,060
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

44
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,940
 I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Anna Tyshinski

45
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,500
 and Andrew Hunter Murray.

46
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,740
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

47
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,740
 with our four favorite Valentine's Day facts.

48
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,940
 And in no particular order, here we go.

49
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,740
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy.

50
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,420
 - My fact is, before flirting with females,

51
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,900
 young male dolphins practice on their male friends.

52
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,580
 - Happy Valentine's Day, everyone.

53
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,580
 - Yeah, this is an erotic special.

54
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,140
 - Roses are red, this fact is very blue.

55
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,340
 - It is quite blue, actually.

56
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,180
 - Well, what do they practice?

57
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,100
 How blue is it?

58
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:18,940
 - Well, that's--

59
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:19,780
 - 'Cause dolphins are blue?

60
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,620
 - Yeah, they're rude.

61
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:21,460
 - Are they?

62
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,380
 - Well, they're sort of blueish, aren't they, in cartoons?

63
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,300
 - Yeah, they're gray, gray blue.

64
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,140
 - They're gray.

65
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:26,980
 - Bluey gray.

66
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,260
 This is a place that actually is a friend of the podcast.

67
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,940
 It's Shark Bay in Australia,

68
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,860
 where some research was done.

69
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,820
 We said it was renamed Safety Beach.

70
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,660
 - Yeah, we did.

71
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,340
 - Yeah, I think that was fake.

72
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,180
 I think that's a retraction we need to make.

73
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,180
 - Oh, great, okay.

74
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,580
 - Are we all making that as a group?

75
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,020
 - No, just me, leave it to me.

76
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,620
 You guys, you guys stay unblemished.

77
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,420
 So there's a group of dolphins who've been living there

78
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,100
 and they've been studying for about 40 years.

79
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,260
 They're really, really well,

80
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,580
 the best-studied group of dolphins in the world.

81
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,380
 They have very complicated social relationships

82
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,220
 with each other.

83
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,220
 Scientists find it very useful to kind of keep tabs on them.

84
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:00,460
 And these young males, they pall up in groups of two or three

85
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,820
 and they coordinate their behavior

86
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,340
 to consort particular females.

87
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,380
 And that, this is where it gets a bit,

88
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,980
 flirting is a very nice way of describing it

89
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,820
 'cause male dolphins sort of coerce

90
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,700
 and harass individual females

91
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,900
 and try and separate them from whichever males

92
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,080
 they're hanging out with.

93
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,740
 But then they do some displays of acrobatics

94
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,700
 and somersaults.

95
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,100
 It sounds like a sort of sea world thing.

96
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,940
 - Uh-huh.

97
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,780
 - You know, they do tricks.

98
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,460
 They do also bite her sometimes.

99
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:31,100
 Anyway, they are really getting some mixed signals here.

100
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,620
 I don't want to get all rubbing thickie on your ass.

101
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,580
 - Look at the somersaults, look at the somersaults.

102
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,500
 (laughing)

103
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,420
 - Yeah, so, but they do practice with each other.

104
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,820
 And the ones who practice with each other

105
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,420
 have better success later in life.

106
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,620
 Romantically, you know, they farther more offspring

107
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,740
 than the ones that don't.

108
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,780
 - Do they ever fall in love with each other accidentally?

109
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,860
 - Oh my God.

110
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,700
 - Good question.

111
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,940
 - Flipper three.

112
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,460
 - Reminds me a bit of a Friends episode

113
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:59,300
 where Joey helps trigger the janitor to dance.

114
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,180
 He's his dance partner and he sort of starts

115
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,340
 to wish that he was his real dance partner.

116
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,700
 I wonder if there are dolphins out there

117
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,940
 who just are like, let's have one more practice.

118
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,780
 - I think so.

119
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,660
 I mean, there's lots of, there are occasionally,

120
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,180
 I find a lot of headlines in the mail,

121
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,420
 the Daily Mail saying things like,

122
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,420
 more gay dolphins spotted off Canada

123
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,180
 like it's very bright and concerned for them.

124
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,020
 - Yeah.

125
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,500
 - Yeah, they can't, they can't be quite aggro,

126
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,340
 can't they?

127
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,180
 - Oh yeah.

128
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,520
 - The dolphins.

129
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,860
 And like, but it is sort of their male bonds

130
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,740
 are sort of nice.

131
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,100
 It does seem like this study, I think,

132
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,700
 was the first to reveal that they have a buddy system

133
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,180
 and they'll pick a best friend.

134
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,860
 Some of the males, not all of the males,

135
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:35,700
 they'll pick a best friend.

136
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,060
 And that'll be someone that they hang out with

137
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,100
 for their whole life.

138
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,220
 And sometimes you'll have the two male buddies

139
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,500
 who hang out together.

140
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,420
 And if they're separated for up to decades,

141
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,060
 I think it is when they come back together,

142
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,340
 they're their best friends still.

143
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,460
 - Once there's quite a few ways that dolphins can mate,

144
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,980
 there's a sort of T-section shape that they do.

145
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,220
 So the male dolphin goes sort of horizontal

146
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,700
 against the vertical of the female dolphin

147
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,140
 in order to have sex.

148
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:58,980
 There's a few other methods.

149
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,780
 One method that gets described for one of the dolphins

150
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:05,300
 is having this buddy, the wingman come,

151
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,260
 and at surface level sort of hold for buoyancy reasons.

152
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,700
 So they're sort of there just to prop him up

153
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,340
 to make sure the sex can happen.

154
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,220
 Which a lot of NASA scientists are saying

155
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,860
 that might be the best way that humans will have sex.

156
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,100
 - We're not taking dolphins up to Mars.

157
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,900
 - We're not taking dolphins, we're just screwing like them.

158
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,180
 If sex is happening, there needs to be a third astronaut

159
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,540
 to come in and just hold everything together.

160
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,300
 - Dave, Dave, sex is happening.

161
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,140
 Come on in.

162
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,340
 (all laughing)

163
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,180
 - Surely not.

164
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,540
 - But there was a recent report by someone

165
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,780
 who's trying to work on the problem

166
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,660
 of population and space. - By a space pervert.

167
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,300
 (all laughing)

168
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,460
 - I think dolphins are perverts really.

169
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,780
 I think by any means.

170
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:45,580
 - Well, they have sex often with their mothers, male dolphins.

171
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,420
 - No.

172
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,180
 - Yeah, bottom-nosed dolphins like to gather

173
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,860
 around gray whales when they're mating.

174
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,020
 No one really knows why,

175
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,060
 but they just enjoy watching.

176
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:55,900
 - Right.

177
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,580
 - You can't get porn underwater.

178
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,660
 - So their mom's nipples are up their butt,

179
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,940
 so when they breastfeed-- - It is, it is.

180
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,180
 So when they breastfeed, they literally burrow their--

181
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,020
 - That can't be true.

182
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,860
 - Dolphin noses into the anus of their mom.

183
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,940
 - No, that can't be true.

184
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,140
 - It's true.

185
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:11,980
 - Is it really?

186
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,380
 - I didn't just come up with that.

187
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,580
 (all laughing)

188
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,220
 I mean, it's possible I did just come up with that, but.

189
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,700
 - Okay, can we bust one myth?

190
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,540
 - Yeah, sure.

191
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,180
 - This is exciting stuff not to blow wide open,

192
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,820
 but to close down.

193
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,740
 And it's a thing we have propagated actually in the past.

194
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,900
 So, you know, it's like the rest for us.

195
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,620
 It's the blowhole, the blowhole sex myth.

196
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,460
 - What's the myth that they have sex with their blowholes?

197
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,300
 - Yeah.

198
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,140
 - And we've claimed that.

199
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:34,980
 - I think so.

200
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:35,820
 - Have we?

201
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:36,660
 - We're perverts. - A long time ago.

202
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,660
 Like nine years ago, I think, you know,

203
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,500
 we're different people now.

204
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,540
 - What's the truth then?

205
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,980
 - I think, well, there's one mention of it

206
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,100
 in a paper in 1994.

207
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,100
 - Oh, you shagged one blowhole.

208
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,460
 (all laughing)

209
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:51,420
 And the researcher, a researcher called Justin Gregg

210
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:55,060
 spoke to the person who had authored that 1994 article

211
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,020
 who said, and I'm quoting here,

212
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,300
 "With regard to the blowhole,

213
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,780
 they never inserted the penis entirely."

214
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,780
 I don't know whether that stands up in court

215
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,620
 and the I'm gonna say.

216
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,540
 - What percentage of the penis?

217
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,180
 Oh, only 25, that's fine.

218
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,700
 - But they breathe through it.

219
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,860
 Turns out they can breathe through their mouth as well,

220
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,820
 which we didn't know until 2016.

221
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,260
 It's assumed that they can't breathe

222
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,980
 because we've never seen them breathing through their mouth.

223
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,980
 But they found one dolphin with a damaged blowhole.

224
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:21,820
 Blowhole.

225
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,220
 (all laughing)

226
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,060
 One of a...

227
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,560
 Are you being serious?

228
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,500
 You have a damaged blowhole.

229
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,100
 (all laughing)

230
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,420
 - No word.

231
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,260
 Or what?

232
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,740
 The damage.

233
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,700
 But they found that it was breathing through its mouth

234
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,540
 as a result.

235
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,700
 So possibly even dolphins don't know

236
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,020
 they can breathe through their mouth.

237
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:42,860
 - Wow.

238
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,680
 - Yeah.

239
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,500
 - We call them clever.

240
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,900
 (all laughing)

241
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,220
 - I feel like everything I've said is a lie so far.

242
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,900
 - Where did you get all this stuff from, Dan?

243
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,100
 - It's just stuff I know.

244
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,140
 (all laughing)

245
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,060
 We've talked a lot in the past

246
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,780
 about dolphins having military connections.

247
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,660
 They've worked with the military a lot.

248
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,500
 I didn't know this.

249
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,580
 There's like the biggest horde of nuclear weapons

250
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,980
 is in a submarine base in America

251
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,660
 and it's protected by military dolphins.

252
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,500
 So anyone trying to get access to it

253
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,820
 has to face a dolphin.

254
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:15,780
 Isn't that amazing?

255
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,620
 And what happens is...

256
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,820
 - Sometimes I think you have your own

257
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,360
 different Google and their experts.

258
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,460
 (all laughing)

259
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,820
 - Well, the interesting thing is if they...

260
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,060
 So they can't...

261
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,940
 It's very hard to monitor an underwater base

262
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,980
 with nuclear weapons.

263
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,500
 So they need an animal that can just be there

264
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,340
 all the time to do it.

265
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,180
 - Where is this?

266
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,020
 Sorry, where...

267
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:34,860
 - It's near Boston.

268
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,700
 - U.S.

269
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,580
 - Yeah, you can't give away the exact location,

270
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,420
 I'm sure, Dan.

271
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,460
 - Yeah, sorry, Seattle.

272
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,300
 It's 20 miles.

273
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,140
 - Oh, it's Seattle.

274
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:41,980
 (all laughing)

275
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,460
 - 5,000 miles from Boston.

276
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,940
 (all laughing)

277
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,660
 - It's the world's largest single location

278
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,900
 of our smell of nuclear weapons.

279
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,740
 - Wow, it's underwater.

280
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,740
 - Certainly at the time of writing.

281
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,580
 It's underwater, right?

282
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,260
 And so they have these military dolphins

283
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,500
 and they have this amazing thing

284
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,420
 where if someone's swimming

285
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,500
 to try and get access to this submarine base

286
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,660
 to steal a nuke of one man just swimming to get to it,

287
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,900
 the dolphins have a metal plate in their mouth

288
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,740
 that when they go up and rub up against the swimmer,

289
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,860
 they can attach like a handcuff,

290
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,060
 like a subtle handcuff going to your leg.

291
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:11,900
 - What are you talking about?

292
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,140
 - Honestly, this is what happens.

293
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,900
 It goes around the leg or the arm of the person

294
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,140
 and then it deploys a boy and floats them,

295
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,300
 like just goes whoop,

296
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,300
 and they just disappear up to the surface.

297
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,180
 - Were they arrested by a police dolphin at the top?

298
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,020
 (all laughing)

299
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,700
 - The dolphins are purely underwater based,

300
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,300
 so that becomes a human problem

301
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,140
 when they arrive at the top.

302
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,340
 - Right, that's either extraordinary

303
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,300
 or what are you talking about?

304
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,420
 - No, that's incredible, unbelievable.

305
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,980
 - This was in 2010, so it's possible the dolphins were fine.

306
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,940
 - Oh yeah, yeah, they're moving on to par places now.

307
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:40,980
 - Well, they get seals as well,

308
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,460
 Navy seals, but like actual seals.

309
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,020
 - Oh yeah, I feel like we have actually mentioned that before.

310
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,900
 We can't just laugh at everything Dan said.

311
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,100
 - No, from now on though. - Some of it is true.

312
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,140
 - You gotta start with something more believable, Dan,

313
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,540
 and then build up to this.

314
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:56,300
 - Well, we know that they do this kind of stuff.

315
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,700
 - It's only Cold War superpowers, isn't it?

316
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,980
 It's only America and Russia that--

317
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,540
 - That we know of. - That we know of,

318
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,940
 that have trained dolphins.

319
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,380
 - I thought Israel did.

320
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,620
 - Oh yeah, they did, they did.

321
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,620
 I'm sure other military powers

322
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,860
 have experimented with all that stuff.

323
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,940
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

324
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,580
 - You know, paw poises that you mentioned.

325
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,820
 You know, they're the reason that we call tortoises,

326
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,740
 tortoises. - No.

327
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,540
 - Which I don't think we've mentioned before,

328
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:20,420
 but because paw poise,

329
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,220
 which is basically a dolphin-- - I'm highly pregnant here.

330
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,940
 It's a whole show.

331
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,460
 - It does feel a bit like it, doesn't it?

332
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,100
 - No, this is absolutely correct.

333
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,340
 Paw poise, etymologically, it means pigfish,

334
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,740
 so the paw is like, has the same root as pork

335
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,380
 and poise is like, poise on poise, fish.

336
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,340
 Tortoises were always tortoise.

337
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,980
 They ended just in US,

338
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,700
 probably coming from a word meaning twisted.

339
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,500
 But once we started having paw poises,

340
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,140
 people went, well, since we spell that like that,

341
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,060
 should we make it tortoises as well?

342
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,020
 'Cause it sounds similar.

343
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,580
 And we think that's the only theory we have

344
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,380
 for why suddenly, about 500 years ago,

345
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,140
 we started spelling tortoise like tortoise.

346
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,980
 - Someone was writing a poem and they're just like--

347
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,820
 (laughing)

348
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,180
 - I got nothing after tortoise.

349
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,140
 - That was the main economic activity 500 years ago,

350
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,220
 was the sonnet, unfortunately.

351
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,300
 And so, it was really important.

352
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,380
 - Can we talk about dolphin vaginas?

353
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,020
 - Of course. - Quickly.

354
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,620
 They have clitorises,

355
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,780
 and the clitorises are so accessible

356
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,700
 when they're having sex

357
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,980
 that we think they're probably used for pleasure.

358
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:18,900
 - Okay.

359
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,020
 - But the vagina is really,

360
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,380
 it's like, unlike most mammals

361
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,340
 where it's really just like a straight tube,

362
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,580
 with them it goes in all sorts of different directions

363
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,780
 and stuff like that.

364
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:31,020
 And you can tell what species a dolphin is

365
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,580
 by looking at its vagina.

366
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,700
 - It's like a labyrinth,

367
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,700
 so they can decide whether or not

368
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,140
 they want to be impregnated.

369
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,620
 - Sorry, do you mean it's like a maze?

370
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,140
 'Cause of course, a labyrinth only has one root, doesn't it?

371
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,940
 So that wouldn't fool anyone.

372
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,940
 - Labyrinth is like a spiral.

373
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,060
 - There's no dead ends in a labyrinth.

374
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,580
 - Yes, no, it's a maze, not a labyrinth, sorry.

375
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,700
 - 'Cause we'd get a lot of emails

376
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,180
 if we left it like that. - You're right, you're right.

377
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,100
 - Can I just very quickly mention

378
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,100
 the basketball player who had a great altercation

379
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,740
 with the dolphin, Clifford Ray.

380
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,700
 - Oh, okay, yeah. - Can I still about him?

381
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,340
 He became super famous for this in 1978 for a short while.

382
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,420
 There was a dolphin called Mr. Spock.

383
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,980
 They realized that there was a bolt

384
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,420
 and a really sharp screw stuck in its stomach

385
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,980
 and second stomach down, so quite far in.

386
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,820
 The vet says, "I can't operate to remove it.

387
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,660
 "My arm won't reach down its throat enough."

388
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,820
 And then they were like, "Who's got really long arms?

389
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,940
 "This basketball player, Clifford Ray,

390
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,100
 "famously has arms of three foot nine inches long,

391
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,220
 "which is long."

392
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,860
 So they got in touch with Clifford

393
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,180
 and he was at a premier in, for some reason,

394
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,700
 and he was taking a premier in,

395
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,740
 waiting to go to a, you know, to a game.

396
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:42,020
 And he rocked up and he was guided by speakerphone,

397
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,140
 by an expert in retrieving stuff

398
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,540
 from the insides of dolphins,

399
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,580
 while he inserted his three foot nine inch long arm

400
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,820
 into the dolphin. - And he's like,

401
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,140
 it's like a labyrinth in here.

402
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,740
 - The other end, the other end.

403
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,320
 (all laughing)

404
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,980
 - Why am I holding a nipple?

405
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,740
 (all laughing)

406
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,540
 - Wait, sorry, why was he on speakerphone?

407
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,460
 'Cause he wasn't there.

408
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,460
 - No, no, sorry, the basketball player was there.

409
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,020
 The vet was-- - The vet?

410
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,540
 - Who needed to guide them?

411
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,820
 The expert vet, who knew all that.

412
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,780
 - You're not gonna turn up to the most interesting

413
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,100
 dolphin-based event of your life.

414
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,180
 He was staying in the Holiday Inn up in the next town.

415
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,620
 It was too good to make. - My gosh.

416
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,140
 - They didn't have much time.

417
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,780
 - And they said, once his arm was in,

418
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,180
 it was three minutes, and after that,

419
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,340
 the dolphin would suffocate.

420
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,340
 And he had to get all the way down, wave his arm.

421
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,460
 - Wait, he's got a bow hole?

422
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,300
 - What?

423
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,140
 - He's got a bow hole?

424
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:30,980
 - It'd have been dumb.

425
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,580
 (all laughing)

426
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,020
 - There's four dolphins.

427
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,540
 - It turns out there's just one dolphin in the world.

428
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,220
 There's this guy.

429
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,620
 - Can I ask a question, if they're short on time,

430
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,220
 the dolphin is obviously in one place.

431
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,460
 They immediately go, who's got long arms

432
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:49,940
 in the immediate vicinity, and he happens to be in town?

433
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,980
 - Well, he's from California, so it was the same state.

434
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:52,940
 - Okay, right.

435
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,500
 - And they needed really long arms.

436
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,340
 - Right.

437
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,260
 - Like, not just like you're a bit tall.

438
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,620
 - Mr. Tickle was embossed.

439
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,420
 (all laughing)

440
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,700
 - Wait, he did it, he did it.

441
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,220
 He did it with only, when there were 15 seconds to spare,

442
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,660
 he says he just remembers the vet on the other end of the line.

443
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:10,100
 - Did they have a big basketball club ticking down?

444
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,940
 - Come on, time out.

445
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,860
 (all laughing)

446
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,460
 - What if he didn't, he would die.

447
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,300
 - Would have suffocated him.

448
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,580
 - And did Mr. Spock live long and prosper?

449
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,340
 - Hey, there we go.

450
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,180
 - And there we go.

451
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,740
 - A gentle end to a very upsetting story.

452
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,420
 (all laughing)

453
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,000
 (upbeat music)

454
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,820
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

455
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,740
 - My fact this week is that the adult

456
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,740
 who's come closest to freezing to death

457
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,420
 and being brought back to life,

458
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,740
 got together with the person who resuscitated her.

459
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,580
 - Mmm.

460
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:48,220
 - Was it Anna from Frozen?

461
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,260
 - It should have been.

462
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,900
 - Maybe that's who Anna from Frozen was named after.

463
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,740
 - It is not, it is Anna.

464
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:53,780
 - 'Cause she is called Anna, isn't it?

465
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,100
 - Yes, yes.

466
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,220
 - Anna Bagenholm.

467
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,580
 - Anna Bagenholm, who's Swedish,

468
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,020
 but she was in Norway at the time.

469
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,260
 This is, I don't know why I'm speaking like that.

470
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:06,060
 This was 1999, and she was skiing with two colleagues.

471
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,180
 And it's just the most amazing story,

472
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,340
 so I'll do a short version,

473
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,220
 and then we'll probably do a long version.

474
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,660
 Basically, she's skiing, she plunges head first

475
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,860
 through a massive layer of ice,

476
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:17,660
 and she's stuck there for ages and ages,

477
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,780
 and she gets very bad hypothermia,

478
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,660
 her heart stops beating, her breathing stops, she's dead.

479
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,220
 She's completely dead.

480
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,940
 And then eventually she gets extracted from the ice.

481
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:31,060
 And the crucial thing that happens as soon as she's extracted,

482
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,180
 and very important to remember this

483
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,660
 for any hypothermia sufferers,

484
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,940
 is that she received CPR straight away

485
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,580
 from her two colleagues who've been skiing with her.

486
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:42,100
 One of whom was a chap called Torvind Nysheim,

487
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,940
 who gave her CPR,

488
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,540
 and it seemed to have absolutely no effect at the time.

489
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,220
 - The other one's going, "Let it go!"

490
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,060
 - Oh, my God.

491
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,180
 - Oh, Jesus Christ.

492
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:54,740
 James is poised to use that in the body as possible,

493
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,860
 but have you got that out of your system?

494
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,740
 Yeah? No more famous lyrics than that?

495
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,860
 - I don't know any of this.

496
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:02,780
 - Okay, I think that's a relief for everyone.

497
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,340
 Anyway, it's thought the CPR probably saved her life,

498
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,100
 along with a bunch of other incredible doctors.

499
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:07,940
 When she got to hospital,

500
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,300
 there were over a hundred doctors in the room,

501
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,260
 or medical staff in the room with her.

502
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,540
 And she did live, and then a few years later,

503
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,460
 she got together with this chap.

504
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:20,780
 And I believe, as of 2022, they were still together.

505
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,780
 - Oh, lovely.

506
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,820
 - But really, this was a way of crowbaring

507
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,420
 this amazing story into a Valentine's special.

508
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,740
 - Yeah, it is an amazing story.

509
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,020
 And at that time, they thought,

510
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,180
 "No way she's coming back."

511
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,780
 For all the doctors, she was literally,

512
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,100
 this was medicine into the unknown, right?

513
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,140
 It was, that's a Frozen 2 song, just for you all there.

514
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:37,980
 - It wasn't.

515
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:38,900
 - Medicine into the unknown.

516
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,940
 Oh, into the unknown, sorry.

517
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,660
 Medicine into the unknown.

518
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,060
 (laughing)

519
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,620
 - Frozen 2, she becomes a GP, she, yeah.

520
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,060
 - There's a polar bear who's swallowed a plastic bag,

521
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:52,340
 and we need the world's best curling team

522
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,740
 to go and get it out.

523
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,460
 - This was a phenomenal thing.

524
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,620
 They thought, "No way is she gonna survive,"

525
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,020
 except they seem to have a phrase there, the doctors,

526
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,060
 which is something like,

527
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,300
 "You're not dead until we warm you up first."

528
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,780
 So no one who's cold can be declared dead.

529
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,420
 You've got to bring them back to war.

530
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,860
 - I think that's true around the world,

531
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,420
 and it's a really crucial thing about being that cold,

532
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:15,860
 because, again, this is what a lot of hypothermia sites say.

533
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,980
 They're like, "Don't assume they're dead, no heart rate,

534
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,380
 "no breathing, pallid skin, why is she,

535
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,700
 "but it could be that once you warm them up again,

536
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,540
 "you come back to life."

537
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,940
 - It's like a goldfish, isn't it?

538
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,860
 If your goldfish is floating upside down,

539
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:27,700
 it might not be dead.

540
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,220
 It might just have a swim bladder problem.

541
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,060
 - Is that so?

542
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:30,900
 - Yeah.

543
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,740
 - So don't flush it down the toilet.

544
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,580
 - That's really good advice.

545
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,020
 - And in the same way with these people.

546
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,460
 - Yeah, don't flush them down, as they do.

547
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,980
 Ignore it when they're done.

548
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,260
 - So this accident she had, she was skiing,

549
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,460
 she had a fall, she went through a hole in the ice,

550
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:46,540
 eight inches of ice, thick ice,

551
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,700
 and she was trapped under the water.

552
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,860
 Her clothes are immediately soaked,

553
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,780
 therefore they're very heavy.

554
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,420
 The shock paralyzes your muscles, so you can't move, right?

555
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,740
 So her friends catch up with her, they--

556
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,940
 - And they can only see her feet in skiing, can they?

557
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,580
 - They can only see her feet, they cannot pull her out,

558
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,660
 because just the position she's in.

559
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,020
 - And also just this is, 'cause she's in the water,

560
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,820
 she's submerged, it's a random air pocket

561
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,980
 that her face happens to be next to

562
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,740
 that allows for her to keep breathing in there.

563
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,700
 - It's stunning, so she's breathing for seven minutes,

564
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,620
 but she's in the water for 40 minutes.

565
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,180
 A team of rescuers arrive, they can't get her out

566
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,540
 with a rope or a snow shovel,

567
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,780
 it's not thick enough to get through the ice.

568
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:25,140
 So she's there, I think another 30 or 40 minutes.

569
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:25,980
 - Another 40 minutes, yeah.

570
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,980
 - And then a team arrives with a pointy shovel,

571
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,020
 which they use to dig through the ice and get her out.

572
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:34,220
 So she's been in the water for 80 minutes freezing.

573
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:37,700
 She's white, she's cold, nothing, nothing is happening.

574
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,820
 It's just extraordinary.

575
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,180
 - It's amazing. - Well, she's dead.

576
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,020
 - She's dead. - She's dead.

577
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,460
 - She's dead, well, except she's not.

578
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,540
 - Well, I mean, what's the definition of death?

579
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,460
 - Exactly, is she warm?

580
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,020
 I don't think so, guys.

581
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,340
 - Good point, good point.

582
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,380
 She had no heartbeat for four hours

583
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,900
 between when her head went through the ice

584
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,460
 and when her heart rate came back.

585
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,740
 - Extraordinary, and it was like nine hours,

586
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,180
 and they say like hundreds of doctors and nurses

587
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,700
 who were just working on her the entire time,

588
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,020
 just trying to bring her back, and they did it.

589
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:07,020
 And when they did, she was paralyzed to begin with

590
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,180
 and pissed off, so why did you bring me back?

591
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,700
 Why did you make me become alive again?

592
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,700
 I now have to live a life

593
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,180
 where I'm not gonna be the person that I wanted to be.

594
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,500
 And she eventually calmed down.

595
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,060
 - Well, after she realized she wasn't paralyzed.

596
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:19,900
 - It took a long time, though,

597
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,300
 for her to get her body completely back to normal.

598
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,860
 - I think it was within not too long, actually.

599
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,020
 And then she did apologize.

600
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,460
 So, yeah, not the romantic reunion initially

601
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,020
 with poor old Naishim, who's like,

602
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,980
 "Oh, she's gonna fall in love with me now," in her eyes.

603
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,860
 - And then her heart melted.

604
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,300
 - Ah, it's Valentine's Day.

605
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,600
 - I love it.

606
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,340
 - The thing, I find it nuts is she's skewed again.

607
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,180
 - Absolute loon.

608
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,780
 She's really into downhill skiing.

609
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,140
 - Six years later, she's skewed again.

610
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:43,980
 Just extraordinary.

611
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,380
 - Did she stay on peace from that one?

612
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,220
 - I don't know.

613
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,060
 - No, I think she's into--

614
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,660
 - She just went to the cafe a bit.

615
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,740
 (all laughing)

616
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,980
 - I believe she's really into extreme skiing still.

617
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:54,820
 - Really?

618
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,780
 - Because people are insane.

619
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,740
 - Can we say what she got down to?

620
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:02,580
 So, normally, your core temperature is 37 degrees, right?

621
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,660
 If your core goes down below 35,

622
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:08,180
 you're officially in hypothermia.

623
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:13,180
 Her core temperature went down to 13.7 degrees Celsius.

624
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:17,260
 - And then a bit later, there was a kid who went to 13,

625
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,540
 who's the coldest anyone has ever been.

626
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,500
 - Yeah.

627
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:24,340
 - And apparently, this is more common to work in children.

628
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,180
 This idea of sort of freezing yourself

629
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,300
 and then coming back to life.

630
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,780
 And it's because you have a greater surface area

631
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,140
 compared to your volume,

632
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,420
 which means that you cool down a lot quicker.

633
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,060
 - Oh, of course, and that's why--

634
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,060
 - And you wanna do that quick freezing at the start.

635
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:38,900
 That's kind of how it works.

636
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,500
 - So, that's why you need to keep babies warm at night

637
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,220
 'cause they cool down faster.

638
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,940
 So, the thing is when you get really, really cold,

639
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,180
 the oxygen demand of your brain lowers drastically.

640
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,660
 And if you're cold enough before your heart stops,

641
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,700
 that's the key.

642
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,500
 That's why doing the CPR is so important.

643
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,820
 Then the cell death, which normally happens

644
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,340
 when you don't have any circulation, it doesn't happen.

645
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,340
 So, her brain needed no oxygen, basically.

646
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,780
 - I think it was like, it had 10%

647
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:05,020
 of the oxygen requirements of your brain normally.

648
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:05,860
 - Oh, sorry, go on.

649
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,820
 - Well, just to say that because this happened,

650
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:11,300
 they're now using the idea of freezing people down.

651
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,700
 If people have had a stroke or if they've had liver failure

652
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,940
 or something like that,

653
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,860
 the idea now is get people really, really, really cold

654
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,420
 and they might survive.

655
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:23,820
 - Yes, and in fact, even though it's quite standard now

656
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,820
 or it's done a lot,

657
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,060
 but we actually don't know why it works.

658
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,020
 And they think that actually,

659
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,060
 it's not about the effects of your heart stopping,

660
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:34,020
 which deprives your brain of oxygen.

661
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,340
 It's actually about when your heart starts again.

662
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,700
 And I didn't know this, but if you have a heart attack

663
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,300
 or if your heart stops,

664
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,260
 one of the really common ways that you die

665
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,100
 is when your heart starts again.

666
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,660
 And it's this thing called reperfusion.

667
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:49,500
 And it means that if your heart's been stopped for long enough,

668
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,380
 then all the chemistry in your brain has changed so much

669
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,420
 in ways that they don't quite understand.

670
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,820
 If blood suddenly floods back in there,

671
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,540
 it completely messes it up and you die.

672
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,380
 - Oh, wow.

673
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,820
 - And so in this way,

674
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,980
 I think it allows that to happen much more gradually

675
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,180
 or it slows the brain down

676
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,060
 and allows it to be a bit more controlled.

677
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,580
 - Is the word reaper a deliberate use there

678
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:11,180
 of the danger, reperfusion?

679
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,220
 - No, it's not reperfusion.

680
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,420
 - I see, it's not that-- - I think it's probably

681
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,140
 just reperfusion again. - Perfusion with the ray

682
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:16,980
 on the front.

683
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,140
 - Yeah, the standard prefix, re.

684
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:18,980
 - Interesting.

685
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,020
 - It should put the A in though.

686
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,660
 Did you guys read about the two things that happen

687
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:26,220
 when you have hypothermia that are most bizarre?

688
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,500
 - Oh, yeah, yes.

689
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,500
 If someone has died of hypothermia,

690
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,260
 you shouldn't just look on the floor,

691
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:34,540
 look in all the crevices and look in all the shelving units

692
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,980
 because they might be curled up in there

693
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:38,260
 because it's a reaction. - Terminal burrowing.

694
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,740
 - Terminal burrowing, yeah.

695
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,900
 That was interesting.

696
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,340
 The other one is taking your clothes off, isn't it?

697
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,980
 - Yes, and it seems to happen a lot.

698
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,260
 There was one study that was done that looked,

699
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,980
 I think, about 70 people who died of hypothermia

700
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,780
 and it found almost all of them

701
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,860
 did this thing called terminal burrowing,

702
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,940
 which, as you say, is where you crawl under a bed

703
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,740
 or behind a cupboard or onto a shelf.

704
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,860
 And it just feels like, you know,

705
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,980
 when you have a cat who's dying,

706
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,300
 it crawls to the very corner under a bed.

707
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,700
 It's like the last protective hibernation thing.

708
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,940
 - Like a really deep instinct, basically.

709
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:06,980
 - Yes, deep.

710
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:09,300
 And the other thing that a quarter of the people did

711
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,620
 was this thing called paradoxical undressing,

712
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,100
 which, again, people who've had hypothermia

713
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,660
 often found completely naked.

714
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,100
 And that's because, at first, you know,

715
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,780
 you have vasodilation where all your veins

716
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,380
 in your extremities constricts

717
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,660
 to try and flood blood to your internal organs

718
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,260
 to keep you warm when you've got hypothermia.

719
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,900
 But then that takes loads and loads of effort

720
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,940
 for your muscles and your body just gives up.

721
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,540
 All the blood floods back to your extremities

722
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,500
 and so suddenly you're like,

723
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,420
 "God, bizarrely, I'm really hot."

724
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,220
 And you take off all your clothes.

725
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,140
 So hot.

726
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,380
 - So maybe the song that's getting hot in here

727
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,420
 is actually the last throes of someone

728
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,860
 who's suffering severe hypothermia.

729
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:43,940
 - That's what it's about, yeah.

730
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:46,500
 - Yeah, the lyric is from Scott's diary, isn't it?

731
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,340
 (laughing)

732
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,920
 (upbeat music)

733
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:55,020
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

734
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,780
 and that is James.

735
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,900
 - Okay, my fact this week is that if ancient

736
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,860
 Mesopotamia had Valentine's cards,

737
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,660
 they would probably contain pictures of knees.

738
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:07,620
 - So we've had the flirting,

739
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,020
 we've now got together with Torvind,

740
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,740
 and now we're sending each other Valentine's cards.

741
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,780
 - Now we're on our knees.

742
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,180
 - We should've done it the other way around, shouldn't we?

743
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,260
 You don't send a Valentine's card

744
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,300
 once you've got together with someone.

745
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,100
 - Anna, this is exactly what I said to these guys

746
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,180
 before we came on air.

747
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,140
 - And I disagree, Anna.

748
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,220
 I think it's much more common.

749
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,300
 I think most Valentine's cards are bought by people

750
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:27,180
 joylessly on the 13th of February in a train station.

751
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,820
 (laughing)

752
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,700
 - I thought you always put, like,

753
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,060
 from anonymous on your Valentine's cards,

754
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,580
 that's the whole point of them.

755
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,140
 - I put anonymous on all the ones I send,

756
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,340
 apart from the one to my wife.

757
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:41,100
 (laughing)

758
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,180
 - Should I explain the fact?

759
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,020
 - Yeah, yeah.

760
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,060
 - So this is a new study about,

761
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:48,100
 they looked at a load of cuneiform texts.

762
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:51,260
 This is some scientists at the University of Finland,

763
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:54,020
 and they looked at loads of phrases

764
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,580
 that are about emotions,

765
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,900
 and they looked at what parts of the body

766
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,020
 were used in those phrases.

767
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:03,300
 And they found that happiness is mostly felt

768
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,420
 in the liver, for instance.

769
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,820
 Shard and Freud are mostly in the lip.

770
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,780
 - Amazing that Shard and Freud was on the list

771
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,340
 of what was a really basic,

772
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:14,340
 it was like happy, sad, anger, Shard and Freud are.

773
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,660
 - On the lip?

774
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,820
 - On the lip, yeah.

775
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:17,980
 - You kind of curl your lip.

776
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:21,660
 - And they found that love was in order,

777
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:25,340
 in the knee, liver, heart, back, and male genitalia.

778
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:28,100
 - Sounds about right.

779
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,140
 - That's like that song, my neck, my back.

780
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,380
 - It's like, head, shoulder, knee, my liver.

781
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:35,020
 - Like, head, shoulders, knees and toes.

782
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,660
 Knee, liver, heart and back, genitalia.

783
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:41,380
 - I would struggle to pinpoint where my liver was,

784
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,820
 as in if I wouldn't know where to say

785
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,220
 if I was feeling something in my liver.

786
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,100
 - The reason that that is a thing is that

787
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,980
 when you open up a body after someone's died,

788
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,340
 the liver is so big compared to everything else,

789
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,180
 you would naturally think that was a really important

790
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,020
 part of the body.

791
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,780
 - I'm just really impressed that they had that knowledge of,

792
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,420
 as in like, that knowledge was widespread,

793
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,340
 that that was a phrase.

794
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,740
 - Well, they didn't know where it was, I suppose,

795
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,820
 necessarily if you were an ordinary guy.

796
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,100
 You'd just say, like, in the same way,

797
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,580
 I'd say my heart bleeds for you,

798
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,020
 and that would, I guess, show sympathy

799
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,140
 and you'd say it's associated with the heart.

800
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:10,180
 You might say, oh, my liver erupts with rage.

801
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,820
 But it is true, the liver seems to have been the heart

802
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:16,140
 for hundreds and hundreds of years and loads of civilizations.

803
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,580
 And they had, it was so important that they thought

804
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:21,540
 that gods imprinted their desires on livers.

805
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,180
 So, and this is in ancient Mesopotamia,

806
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:26,340
 but when you sacrifice a sheep, let's say,

807
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,460
 its liver would then be taken out

808
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,380
 and they used to make clay liver models

809
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,060
 of the exact shape of the liver

810
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,260
 that that sheep had had inside it.

811
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,780
 And then they would analyze the models

812
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:38,140
 like you'd read a poem and that would tell them the future.

813
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:41,420
 'Cause they thought the god will have put their desire

814
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:44,260
 and the future onto the liver shape of this sheep.

815
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,820
 - But how do you know you've got the right sheep?

816
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,180
 It just feels like a very inefficient system.

817
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,100
 - I think God knows, I think maybe God changes the shape

818
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,380
 as it's being sacrificed.

819
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,060
 So God sees that you're sacrificing that sheep

820
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,220
 and then quickly molds the liver into that shape.

821
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,500
 I'm not sure exactly that logic.

822
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,460
 - No, we shouldn't, we shouldn't try.

823
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,260
 Where is Mesopotamia again, is it Turkey?

824
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,100
 - Iraq.

825
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,300
 - Iraq, yeah.

826
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:04,660
 And we're talking 2,500 BC-ish.

827
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,500
 - Long time ago.

828
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,980
 - Oh, it's a very long time ago.

829
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:07,820
 But this is--

830
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:08,660
 - That is civilization.

831
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,500
 - It sort of is.

832
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,780
 We're all this writing these cuneiform tablets.

833
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,460
 And so we keep finding out more and more about it

834
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,380
 'cause more are found.

835
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,620
 They've survived the test of time.

836
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,860
 These amazing clay tablets that are found

837
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,620
 in their hundreds and thousands in hordes

838
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,460
 whenever they--

839
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,300
 - It's 'cause they're made of clay, right?

840
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,140
 - Exactly, yeah, it was--

841
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,620
 - Not like Balencian's cards.

842
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:27,380
 - Exactly, for all we know, there were millions of them.

843
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,460
 So it was a huge trade back then.

844
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,620
 'Cause it was thought up until recently

845
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:35,500
 that 1,500 BC was when we started kissing.

846
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,180
 - You mean the oldest depiction we found

847
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,940
 or we actually found a couple locked in--

848
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,100
 - No, the oldest depiction of it.

849
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,060
 But actually we now have records via cuneiform

850
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,620
 that show us that back then they were very romantic

851
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,660
 and they were kissing and not just within marriage,

852
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:51,740
 they were also kissing as dates and socially and so on.

853
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:54,460
 And there's only one other major contestant

854
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:57,060
 to say that it's older, which is a kiss

855
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:59,100
 that may have happened between a Neanderthal

856
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,780
 and a human over 100,000 years ago.

857
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,620
 And they know this because they found a microbe inside

858
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:09,020
 on the skull of a human, but you would only get it

859
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:09,860
 from a Neanderthal.

860
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:12,260
 So they know that a bit of tonsil hockey was going on.

861
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,900
 - Well, they were playing that game where you--

862
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,580
 - Pass a balloon. - Pass a egg, pass a balloon.

863
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,900
 - Oh, an egg. - An egg?

864
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:19,420
 - You pass on, is it not an egg from one mouth to the next?

865
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,260
 What did you think it was?

866
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,380
 - It was of a big mouth.

867
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,220
 - Those are quite big.

868
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,740
 - Yeah, you could do it with a quail's egg.

869
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,460
 But again, that's quite socially restrictive.

870
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,980
 - Was it like scrambled or poached

871
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,940
 or the kind of egg which is--

872
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,260
 - I'm thinking in shell.

873
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,500
 I'm sure we did it with eggs.

874
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,020
 - I mean, you can fit an egg in your mouth,

875
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,220
 but it is a choking hazard,

876
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,780
 I would say. - Oh, yeah.

877
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,740
 It's not sexy, I think.

878
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,820
 Ugh, it's locked behind my teeth.

879
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,100
 (laughing)

880
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,620
 - I've misunderstood the rules.

881
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,460
 - That's very funny.

882
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,620
 That's, yeah.

883
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,900
 I mean, we say I go weak at the knees.

884
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,740
 - Yes, exactly, I was thinking that, yeah.

885
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:51,420
 Yeah, I think knees would be in our list of things.

886
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:54,780
 The weird thing I found was under sexual attraction,

887
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:57,500
 which was one of the simple emotions they had.

888
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,780
 The six body parts, was it five?

889
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:02,060
 Five body parts associated with that.

890
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,100
 Well, what would you guess was in there?

891
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,020
 Eyes, you would think, right?

892
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,980
 - I would have thought, firstly, genitals.

893
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,340
 I mean, genitals feature so much

894
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,740
 in so many other emotions,

895
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:13,540
 like kind of distress or contempt.

896
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:16,780
 Sexual attraction, genitals and penis aren't in there.

897
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:19,180
 It's head, knee, neck, hand and ankle.

898
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:23,660
 - Head, knee, knee, neck, neck and ankle.

899
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,180
 - Ankle's a bit of an odd one, isn't it?

900
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,180
 - Well, like Victorians.

901
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,540
 Like Chilbert and Ankle.

902
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:31,140
 - Yeah, if you've got restrictive social practices.

903
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,620
 - What period are we talking about?

904
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,780
 - This is the same study.

905
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:34,620
 - This is ancient Mesopotamia.

906
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,460
 - Oh, right.

907
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,180
 'Cause there's a whole subcategory now

908
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,540
 of celebrity spotting on celebrities' knees.

909
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,460
 - Not that period.

910
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,500
 We're not looking at that period.

911
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,900
 - Is it like wiki knees or something?

912
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,180
 - No, it's like how if we look at a sort of photo

913
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,500
 of Meghan Markle, you'll see Casper,

914
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,660
 the friendly ghost's face on her knee.

915
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,500
 - Oh, there was a thing where,

916
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,180
 oh no, I'm getting it wrong.

917
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,180
 I thought Sandy Tuxwick might have been on someone's knees.

918
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,380
 - She was, exactly.

919
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,220
 Yeah, yeah.

920
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,700
 There's a lot of faces that are appearing on knees recently.

921
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,060
 - I would presume it's normally,

922
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,660
 I mean, no disrespect to the glorious Sandy.

923
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,300
 It's normally people with quite wrinkly faces

924
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,620
 who are being spotted in other people's knees.

925
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,460
 - No.

926
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,500
 - It surely is very rarely,

927
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,380
 'cause knees are knobbly, you know, wrinkly.

928
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,220
 - Wrinkly?

929
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,540
 My knees are perfectly smooth.

930
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,380
 - Oh. - Yeah.

931
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,220
 - Casper the friendly ghost,

932
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,060
 doesn't ever notice that.

933
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:17,300
 - Anna, you've been having routine knee Botox knees.

934
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,140
 (laughing)

935
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,540
 - Knees, they have a lot of nerve endings.

936
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,820
 So they are known as an erogenous zone.

937
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:26,100
 And that's because you have nerves that go through your knee

938
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,980
 that do everything that in your feet

939
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,740
 and up at the top of your thighs as well.

940
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,300
 Basically, all the nerves that are in your leg

941
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,460
 have to go through your knees.

942
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,260
 So they have a lot of nerve endings.

943
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,100
 - That's good.

944
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,860
 - And the attraction to knees,

945
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:40,980
 the paraphilia of that is called genufilia.

946
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:41,940
 - Oh, like genuflecting?

947
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,300
 - Exactly, yeah.

948
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,580
 Do you want some more of those, by the way?

949
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,420
 - Yes, please.

950
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:49,780
 - Alvin O'Lagnea is the attraction to--

951
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,740
 - Alvin, a chipmunk, I can eat.

952
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,500
 (laughing)

953
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,020
 - It's the midriff.

954
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:55,860
 - Okay.

955
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,420
 - The belly button and tummy and stuff.

956
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,260
 - Nice.

957
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,980
 - Bro midophilia.

958
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:00,820
 - Bro.

959
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:01,660
 - Yeah, it's like--

960
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,500
 - Podcasters.

961
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,660
 (laughing)

962
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,980
 - It's the attraction to body odor.

963
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:06,820
 - Oh, wow.

964
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:10,060
 - And matiaphilia is tough.

965
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:14,740
 It's the attraction to non-normal looking eyes.

966
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,620
 And it comes from the Greek term for the evil eye.

967
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,460
 - Hard.

968
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,420
 - Like those dogs that have one eye of different colors.

969
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,860
 - Like David Bowie, I guess.

970
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:22,700
 - And like David Bowie.

971
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,540
 - Quite a few of those.

972
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:25,420
 I would think of not sort of unnatural attractions,

973
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,740
 like midriffs, you know, a traditionally,

974
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,580
 a slightly sexy thing.

975
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,420
 So I've got the midriff out.

976
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,420
 - It's interesting 'cause a paraffilia by definition

977
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:34,420
 should be attraction to something atypical.

978
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,660
 But then when you look at the list,

979
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,940
 there was one which is normalphilia,

980
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,300
 which is the attraction to normal things.

981
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,140
 (laughing)

982
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:42,980
 - Right.

983
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,700
 - So is that normal things to be attracted to

984
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,020
 or normal things like a table?

985
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:46,860
 (laughing)

986
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,700
 That is unusual.

987
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,540
 - Oh, that is unusual.

988
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,260
 Then yeah, I read one earlier today, weirdly,

989
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,420
 nothing to do with this about being sexually attracted

990
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,060
 to people falling downstairs.

991
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:54,900
 (laughing)

992
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,740
 - What?

993
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,340
 - And that's why you always sit down to watch an episode

994
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,340
 you'd be afraid of.

995
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,700
 (laughing)

996
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,420
 - His pants around his ankles.

997
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,340
 (laughing)

998
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,580
 - Setting my family out of the room.

999
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,020
 - Right, everyone out.

1000
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:08,940
 - If you've got any videos of yourself falling downstairs

1001
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,340
 and send it to dad and he'll give you 250 pounds.

1002
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,580
 (laughing)

1003
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:18,140
 - All right, here's a little micro quiz.

1004
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:21,380
 Which of these phrases is the oldest?

1005
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,100
 I'm gonna give you three.

1006
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,620
 To have someone over your knee.

1007
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,260
 - Like to spank them kind of thing.

1008
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,260
 - That's the implication.

1009
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,100
 - Right.

1010
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,780
 - A knee slapper.

1011
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:31,620
 - That's a joke.

1012
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,460
 - That's a joke.

1013
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,020
 And upon the knees of the gods.

1014
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,140
 - Oh, I don't know what that one means.

1015
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:38,060
 So that's why I would say that would be the oldest

1016
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:38,900
 'cause I've never heard of it.

1017
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,220
 - Okay.

1018
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,780
 - Do you mean thigh slapper?

1019
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,820
 I've never heard of a knee slapper.

1020
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,020
 - A knee slapper is the phrase.

1021
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:44,860
 - Is it?

1022
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:45,700
 - Yeah.

1023
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,540
 I think thigh slapper too.

1024
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,380
 Depends on how funny the joke is.

1025
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,220
 - Of course.

1026
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,060
 - Well, how long your legs were?

1027
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:49,900
 - And what you wearing?

1028
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,340
 (laughing)

1029
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,700
 - For that basketball player,

1030
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,020
 it was an ankle slapper.

1031
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,900
 (laughing)

1032
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:56,740
 - Okay.

1033
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,460
 James is saying upon the knees of the gods is oldest.

1034
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:00,460
 - Probably knee slapper, I reckon.

1035
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,540
 - Yeah, I'm gonna say knee slapper as well

1036
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,060
 because I'll do the third one

1037
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,700
 just for the sake of having a full house.

1038
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,860
 - To have someone over your knee.

1039
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,260
 - Yeah.

1040
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:10,020
 - Upon the knees of the gods is ancient Greek.

1041
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:10,860
 - What does it mean?

1042
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,020
 - Well, that's what one would have get.

1043
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,260
 - Yeah, that was the obvious one, Andy.

1044
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,380
 - Yeah, well, James got there first.

1045
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:17,860
 So maybe you two should fuck up your ideas a bit next time.

1046
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,420
 - You'd be great in a quiz, Dan.

1047
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,140
 It's like, what is the capital of France?

1048
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:21,980
 Paris.

1049
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,620
 Oh, that was the obvious answer, guys.

1050
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,100
 - We knew that as well, actually.

1051
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,420
 - It did feel like Andy would be pulling

1052
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,060
 some sort of rock up run for our feet

1053
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,020
 rather than just going.

1054
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:29,980
 - No, I'm a nice guy.

1055
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:30,980
 I leave the rock under your feet.

1056
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,460
 - Right, okay.

1057
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,380
 - It's the one you're thinking of

1058
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,980
 is the title of my quiz format.

1059
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,300
 (laughing)

1060
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,700
 It's an ancient Greek phrase, theon engounasi,

1061
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,580
 which means it's beyond human control.

1062
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,180
 It's like it's in the lap of the gods, actually,

1063
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,780
 but it's on the knees of the gods.

1064
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:47,540
 Okay, a knee slapper is from 1955

1065
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:50,220
 and to have someone over your knee takes to 1866,

1066
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,040
 which is quite something

1067
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,180
 that someone used that phrase on me recently.

1068
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,740
 - Say the phrase again?

1069
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,940
 - To have someone over your knee.

1070
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,180
 - And someone used that on you?

1071
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,860
 - Yeah, it was a removals guy

1072
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,460
 the last time I was moving in the house.

1073
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,300
 - Yeah.

1074
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:05,180
 - I'd left something at the bottom of the staircase, right?

1075
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,020
 'Cause I was moving down the--

1076
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,180
 - That's how they fall down the stairs.

1077
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,900
 (laughing)

1078
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,660
 - You haven't sent me that video yet, by the way.

1079
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:12,900
 I'd paid good money for that.

1080
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,460
 - I'd put like a glass picture frame

1081
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,420
 at the bottom of the stairs

1082
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,620
 and I hadn't moved it out to the van or whatever.

1083
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,740
 And he said, "I'd have you over my knee

1084
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:20,940
 if you were one of my boys."

1085
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,200
 - It was a whole unusual thing.

1086
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,180
 - It was much nicer than the way he made it sound.

1087
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,720
 - I also think that this whole quiz

1088
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,880
 is leading up to that anecdote.

1089
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,720
 - Yeah.

1090
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,560
 - How could you think that?

1091
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,000
 (laughing)

1092
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,660
 - When the anecdote was so bad.

1093
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,280
 (laughing)

1094
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,300
 - Unless there's one extra bit you're not telling us.

1095
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,140
 - Nope.

1096
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:38,980
 - Okay.

1097
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,400
 - That's the subtitle of the quiz.

1098
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,340
 - That's all there is to it.

1099
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,920
 - That's all there is to it.

1100
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,680
 - Um, here's a song from Chicago,

1101
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,400
 which I won't sing, but I'll read you the lyrics.

1102
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,640
 - The band Chicago.

1103
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,020
 - Or the musical Chicago.

1104
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:51,860
 - The musical.

1105
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,200
 - No, the city.

1106
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,300
 (laughing)

1107
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,660
 - That's a buster, isn't it?

1108
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:56,780
 - The pizza company.

1109
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:59,060
 Um, okay, so it's from the musical.

1110
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:01,740
 Why don't we paint the town and all that jazz?

1111
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:05,960
 I'm gonna rouge my knees and roll my stockings down.

1112
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,000
 - Yep.

1113
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,060
 - That's weird, isn't it?

1114
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:10,220
 - Yes, why do they, I've never questioned that before.

1115
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:12,140
 I'm gonna rouge my knees.

1116
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:12,980
 Hmm.

1117
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:13,820
 - Carpet burn.

1118
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,280
 - It's not carpet burn, Dan.

1119
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,380
 Like, why would you,

1120
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,700
 why you'd be deliberately faking a carpet burn

1121
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,260
 on your knees with rouge?

1122
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,600
 - Well, that's pretty sexy, isn't it?

1123
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,440
 - Yeah.

1124
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,960
 - You wanna know how I got these knees?

1125
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,800
 I'll never tell.

1126
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,920
 - So yeah, rouge as in makeup, red makeup.

1127
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:33,920
 And this was a popular thing in the flapper period,

1128
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,380
 which was to put makeup on your knees.

1129
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,640
 - Like a little face.

1130
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,240
 - In actual fact, sometimes they put,

1131
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,600
 there were some images of young women

1132
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,800
 with quite short skirts and with little faces on their knees.

1133
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,580
 - Is that one because it's soundly toxic on both knees?

1134
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,980
 - That's good flirting.

1135
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:51,940
 I think that's really good flirting.

1136
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:54,180
 If you're opposite someone on a train, for example,

1137
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,540
 you just, whoop, you hook up your skirt a little bit.

1138
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,420
 There's your winking face on your knee.

1139
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:00,420
 And then you, you know, you see if they notice.

1140
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,060
 - Yeah, it's good.

1141
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:02,900
 - Isn't that good?

1142
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,380
 I'm sorry, that's creative flirting.

1143
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,780
 - If you're pulling up your kill

1144
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,500
 to say that it's winking at you.

1145
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,620
 (all laughing)

1146
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,860
 - That's no sparring.

1147
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:14,940
 - But yeah, this was the thing.

1148
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:18,480
 It was women had started to be able to show their knees

1149
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,320
 and they decided, well, we're going to make the most of it.

1150
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,800
 And so they started putting makeup on.

1151
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,200
 - So it's poor men were suddenly going around saying,

1152
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,640
 did you know women's knees have smiley face on them?

1153
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,560
 (all laughing)

1154
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,400
 That's amazing.

1155
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,240
 - That's great.

1156
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,080
 - Only animal with four knees.

1157
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,080
 - Dogs, cats, elephants.

1158
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:35,920
 - Quadrupeds.

1159
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,760
 - Any quadruped.

1160
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,880
 - No, no, they don't have countless knees on the back.

1161
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,640
 No animals have four knees.

1162
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,980
 Zero, one animal has four kneecaps.

1163
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:45,900
 - Yeah.

1164
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,740
 - And it only has two legs.

1165
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,100
 (all laughing)

1166
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:49,940
 - I know the answer.

1167
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,020
 Are we still playing Andy's quiz?

1168
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,500
 'Cause I can get it if yes.

1169
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,940
 - This is a horrible riddle in a cave in ancient Greece.

1170
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,260
 It's ridiculous.

1171
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,100
 Sorry.

1172
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,540
 What you're saying is that all animals,

1173
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,580
 all quadrupeds, they have arms and legs rather.

1174
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,900
 They may walk around on all fours.

1175
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:03,740
 - Exactly.

1176
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,980
 - But their skeleton structure is.

1177
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,100
 - They have elbows and knees.

1178
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,180
 They don't have four knees.

1179
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,020
 - Exactly.

1180
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:08,860
 Sorry, that's.

1181
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:11,300
 - And there's one bipedal one that has four knees.

1182
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,440
 - We should just let Dan answer.

1183
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,340
 - Well, two knees are hidden under a coat of feathers.

1184
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,000
 - Oh, they're all hidden.

1185
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,080
 - Are we talking about the same animal here?

1186
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:18,920
 - Yeah, we are.

1187
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,760
 I think you just haven't looked

1188
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,600
 at the diagrams closely enough.

1189
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,400
 (all laughing)

1190
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,240
 - Right, so it's feathered.

1191
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,480
 - Okay, if it's two-legged and feathered, an ostrich.

1192
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,320
 - Yes!

1193
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,920
 James, that's very good, actually.

1194
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,520
 - Well, it was either that or an emu or a cassowary.

1195
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,800
 - Whose quiz is better?

1196
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:35,040
 Like mine, where it's to get me into a dull anecdote,

1197
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,820
 or Anna's, where it's a mental shit show.

1198
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,960
 (all laughing)

1199
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,900
 I haven't worked out the format,

1200
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,980
 but I think the kernel of an idea is there.

1201
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:45,820
 This is really interesting.

1202
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,740
 We only found out recently that ostriches

1203
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,840
 have four kneecaps.

1204
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:52,980
 Everything else has two, and sort of four knees.

1205
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,820
 So if you look at birds like ostriches,

1206
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,500
 the thing that you might think is a knee,

1207
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,980
 if you're an idiot, is actually the ankle, right?

1208
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,620
 Because if you look at those birds--

1209
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,060
 - The knees are up inside.

1210
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,540
 - The knees are up inside the feathers, yeah.

1211
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,140
 - They've got really long feet bones.

1212
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:05,980
 - Exactly.

1213
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,900
 - It's like how horses, like the lower half of their leg,

1214
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:08,980
 is actually their middle toe.

1215
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,400
 Precisely, all animals like that.

1216
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,240
 But up, though, under their feathers,

1217
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,640
 they seem to have two sets of knees.

1218
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,720
 We really don't know why.

1219
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,680
 Two sets of knees, two sets of kneecaps.

1220
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,880
 And who knows why, but cassowaries and emus

1221
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,640
 don't have any at the end.

1222
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,600
 Dan, back me up on this.

1223
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,440
 - It's true.

1224
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,280
 - Yeah.

1225
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,480
 - It's a great quiz, but the host says back me up, Dan.

1226
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,480
 (all laughing)

1227
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,060
 (upbeat music)

1228
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:37,520
 - Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,

1229
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,720
 and that is my fact.

1230
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,980
 My fact this week is that once married,

1231
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:44,460
 some Australian Aboriginals spend the rest of their lives

1232
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:47,320
 actively avoiding their mother-in-law.

1233
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:51,220
 - Hey, didn't know I was an Australian Aboriginal, hey.

1234
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,000
 - I actually think my mother-in-law's brilliant.

1235
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,740
 (all laughing)

1236
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:57,020
 - So this is a thing that's called avoidance speech.

1237
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:59,780
 And a lot of native Australians have this

1238
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:02,340
 as part of their culture, where once they're married,

1239
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,060
 the idea of talking to their in-laws

1240
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:06,300
 is suddenly something that's seen as taboo,

1241
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,300
 and you never do.

1242
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:10,480
 And there's quite a few examples of modern-day marriages

1243
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,920
 where this is still adhered to.

1244
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,640
 So I was reading a blog by a guy who was saying that

1245
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,540
 with his parents-in-laws, he can't hand food directly

1246
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:20,120
 to them either, as well as not talking to them.

1247
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,320
 - It must make the egg game very difficult.

1248
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,900
 (all laughing)

1249
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:28,580
 - You can't look at them directly

1250
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,460
 if he has something that he needs to ask them.

1251
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,680
 He needs to ask them through the wife.

1252
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,680
 So she goes and gets their permission

1253
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,800
 or finds out something for them.

1254
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,580
 And it's seen as something that's a marker of respect

1255
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,820
 in these families.

1256
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,580
 And the same person who was writing this blog,

1257
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,740
 who did that with his wife, now has that

1258
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:47,740
 with his relationship with his daughter's husband.

1259
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:49,580
 And then your language gets changed as well.

1260
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,480
 So they won't say the name.

1261
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,900
 They'll say my mother-in-law and father-in-law.

1262
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,580
 They won't use their actual name.

1263
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:56,980
 And if they're in a room with them and they're watching TV,

1264
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,260
 let's say the son-in-laws in the room,

1265
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,220
 he'll face the wall away.

1266
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,220
 So he's not acknowledging them.

1267
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,380
 Why are they watching TV?

1268
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:06,180
 That's a very anti-social thing to do.

1269
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,040
 So annoying.

1270
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,520
 What's happening now?

1271
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,000
 And what's happening now?

1272
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,840
 - No, no, no, please.

1273
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,240
 My wife just told me what's happening now, not you.

1274
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,880
 Why do these taboos exist?

1275
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,720
 That's what I'm really baffled by.

1276
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,960
 - Well, they are around the world, aren't they?

1277
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,040
 - It's extraordinary.

1278
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,400
 Native America, across Africa, Australian originals,

1279
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,560
 what, and I haven't read an explanation.

1280
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,400
 - I did read them.

1281
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,240
 - Which satisfies me.

1282
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,480
 - It's potentially a respect thing.

1283
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,120
 It might be a way of preventing any hanky-panky.

1284
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:32,960
 - I think it's not.

1285
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,360
 I think it's gotta be shagging.

1286
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,680
 - There was a big article I read

1287
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,420
 called "The Mother-in-Law Taboo" by A.E.M.J. Pans,

1288
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:41,460
 which is one of the main papers on this subject.

1289
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:44,380
 And he reckons that basically it's to indicate publicly

1290
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:46,060
 that the son-in-law and the mother-in-law

1291
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,860
 are not having sex with each other.

1292
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,300
 - But it makes me think they are.

1293
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,460
 That's the weird thing.

1294
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,620
 It's always in the office.

1295
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,740
 It's always the two people who are completely pretending

1296
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:54,660
 they don't know each other exist

1297
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,420
 who turn out to have been having a torrid affair.

1298
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,260
 - Is it?

1299
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,100
 - It's exactly what I thought.

1300
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,100
 And also it will make you fancy them.

1301
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,740
 The more you're told you're not allowed to speak

1302
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,300
 with someone or stick your tongue down their throat,

1303
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,740
 the more you want it, don't you?

1304
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:04,740
 - A bit of fruit.

1305
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:05,900
 - Yes.

1306
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,020
 Also, why was that bad?

1307
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:10,700
 - Why is it bad to have it with your father-in-law?

1308
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,540
 Why is it bad?

1309
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:13,420
 - So the reason is that it happens more

1310
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:16,060
 in matrilineal cultures.

1311
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:19,260
 So, and it's like this taboo, it does happen.

1312
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,500
 And that's true.

1313
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,060
 And it tends to be that the women

1314
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:24,700
 have very particular roles that they have.

1315
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,900
 And the idea is that your mother-in-law

1316
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,860
 is not taking over the job

1317
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,660
 of what your wife is supposed to do.

1318
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,500
 - I see.

1319
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,380
 - So there might be lots of different things

1320
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:34,140
 that a wife is supposed to do in this culture,

1321
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:36,660
 one of which is sleeping with the husband,

1322
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,500
 but they're trying to show

1323
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,860
 that this definitely isn't happening

1324
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,740
 and that the generation has moved on

1325
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:41,860
 to the next generation.

1326
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,820
 That's the idea.

1327
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:44,060
 - And I suppose that's the woman,

1328
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,740
 other woman that you would see most often.

1329
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,140
 So if you were going to shag anyone else,

1330
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:49,080
 it would probably be your wife's mum.

1331
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,900
 And I think sometimes mother-in-law taboos

1332
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:53,060
 also apply to like your mother-in-law's mate.

1333
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:55,780
 Sometimes mother-in-law can be a bit of a broader term.

1334
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,860
 So it can be a few women who are also really close to you.

1335
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:59,820
 - Yeah, we should say these taboos,

1336
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:02,500
 they vary a lot between different groups.

1337
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:07,100
 So in some cases, it's completely avoiding them physically.

1338
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,940
 In some, it's using a particular,

1339
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,820
 like a different language to address them.

1340
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,740
 And in some, it's using a subset of language.

1341
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:15,480
 So there's a group called Deer Bell is a language.

1342
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,420
 And the main language is called Gouel.

1343
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:21,060
 And the language for your mother-in-law is Dianghi.

1344
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,620
 I'm trying to pronounce it wrong.

1345
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:25,940
 But it's like, it's missing particular words

1346
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:28,100
 that might be erotic flash points.

1347
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:31,140
 - Sorry, like what?

1348
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:33,580
 - Oh loads, erotic flash points.

1349
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,420
 - Like ankle.

1350
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:35,780
 - I mean, there are loads, are there?

1351
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:38,180
 Pubic hair, sweaty smell, you know.

1352
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,020
 You don't want to mention that

1353
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,740
 in case things just pop off suddenly.

1354
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:41,860
 So yeah, yeah.

1355
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:43,500
 - So you're saying you don't say that those words

1356
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,860
 in front of your mother-in-law either?

1357
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:46,060
 - I'd have to have a really good reason

1358
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:48,060
 to talk about pubic hair in front of my mother-in-law.

1359
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,420
 - Exactly, I think anyone would.

1360
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:51,460
 - But that's the thing, it's not mad taboo

1361
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,820
 against sleeping with your mother-in-law.

1362
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,100
 - I read one thing.

1363
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:57,820
 This is by a US historian called Hampton Sides.

1364
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,620
 And that the reason I'm saying it's by him

1365
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:00,700
 is 'cause I don't believe it.

1366
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:03,820
 But he wrote that in the Navajo people,

1367
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:06,180
 husbands are not allowed to look at their mother-in-laws

1368
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:08,700
 and it's so important

1369
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:11,620
 that the mother-in-laws would wear little bells

1370
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:14,540
 on their clothes so that he could hear them coming.

1371
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:15,380
 - I think that's true.

1372
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:17,060
 - I just can't believe it's true.

1373
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:18,660
 But it was, he's a proper historian.

1374
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:19,500
 - I think that's true.

1375
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,340
 - Like he's a bird and they're the cat.

1376
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:22,900
 - Yeah, exactly.

1377
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,460
 - I think there was a first-hand account.

1378
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:26,700
 And it's similar to the Kaurawai people in West Papua

1379
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,500
 who shout when they're going round corners

1380
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,460
 for exactly the same reason.

1381
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,180
 The mother-in-law, son-in-law taboo,

1382
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:33,780
 they'll shout to make clear if a son-in-law's there,

1383
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:36,300
 go away, and also if the son-in-law's friends

1384
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,380
 see the mum coming, they'll run and find the son

1385
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:39,580
 and say, "She's coming, she's coming."

1386
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:40,420
 - That's interesting.

1387
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,900
 That's like working in a restaurant.

1388
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:44,260
 Whenever you go round the corner, you go corner.

1389
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:45,100
 - Oh, nice.

1390
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,220
 - So that people coming in the other direction

1391
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:47,780
 don't hit you and you drop all the food.

1392
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:49,220
 - Is that when you're going in and out of the kitchen

1393
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:50,060
 is where you shout something like that?

1394
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:52,820
 - Yeah, at any time, when you're going in a blind corner.

1395
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:54,380
 - Well, and like, did your grandparents

1396
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:55,300
 always used to honk the horn

1397
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,660
 going around any corner driving?

1398
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:57,700
 (laughing)

1399
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:58,540
 - No.

1400
00:43:58,540 --> 00:43:59,360
 - Didn't they?

1401
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,200
 It's so embarrassing.

1402
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,660
 - Oh my God, that time we went to that labyrinth,

1403
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:02,500
 it was a nightmare.

1404
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,460
 (laughing)

1405
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:05,420
 - I used to hate it so much.

1406
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:07,140
 Every corner, gamma honked her horn.

1407
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:08,860
 It was just awful.

1408
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:11,140
 Yeah, it was so motivating.

1409
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:12,260
 - That's so funny.

1410
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:14,580
 - Sometimes I think you have to concentrate really hard

1411
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:16,300
 to keep these taboos going.

1412
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:21,300
 So there's one in a similar mother-in-law, son-in-law taboo

1413
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:24,300
 in southwestern Ethiopia.

1414
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:27,180
 And it's a practice called Balisha.

1415
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:30,820
 And it's basically that married women

1416
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:34,120
 can't speak the name of their husband's mother or father,

1417
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,780
 but they also can't speak any word

1418
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,260
 beginning with the same syllable

1419
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:40,380
 of their husband or father's name.

1420
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:41,220
 So--

1421
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,260
 - So if my mother-in-law was called Pat,

1422
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:45,340
 I couldn't say, what's the word we can use, Pat?

1423
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:46,180
 - Pat the dog?

1424
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:48,940
 - Yeah, right, I'd have to say, can you stroke the dog?

1425
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:52,100
 - What was the name of that World War II general from America?

1426
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:54,820
 (laughing)

1427
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:56,380
 - Eisenhower.

1428
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:57,860
 - What's the name of that postman?

1429
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:00,260
 (laughing)

1430
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:01,100
 - That's interesting.

1431
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:03,140
 - You'd have to concentrate so much.

1432
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:06,420
 - But apparently in those cultures where that's the case,

1433
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:08,180
 you're taught another language

1434
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:10,100
 so that if you were in that situation,

1435
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:12,300
 not only will you be able to know what to do,

1436
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,740
 but you will say words everyone else will know as well.

1437
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:16,420
 - And some of them, you do have another language, yeah.

1438
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:17,460
 And then some, they're just like,

1439
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:19,140
 come up with another word, say stroke,

1440
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:20,300
 which isn't the same as passing.

1441
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,140
 So, you know.

1442
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:22,340
 - Horseman stroke.

1443
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:24,380
 (laughing)

1444
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:25,860
 - Incest taboos.

1445
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:26,700
 - Oh, yeah.

1446
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:29,620
 - From around the world, including Anglo-Saxon,

1447
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:32,260
 I wanted to see if it existed in this country.

1448
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:34,780
 And according to the penitential of Theodore,

1449
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:36,700
 which is from the seventh century,

1450
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:39,620
 if a brother commits fornication with his brother,

1451
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:42,300
 he has to do penance for 15 years.

1452
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:45,700
 So that's 15 years without eating meat or drinking wine

1453
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:47,500
 if you have sex with your brother.

1454
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:48,340
 - Okay.

1455
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:49,180
 - Climby.

1456
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:50,020
 - That's a lot, I don't know.

1457
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:50,860
 - That's a lot, that's a lot.

1458
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:52,660
 - It's not worth it, it's not worth it, would you say?

1459
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:54,260
 (laughing)

1460
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:55,300
 - Well, there was a thing in Old England,

1461
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:59,060
 the swesterosunu, which is where that's your sister's son.

1462
00:45:59,060 --> 00:45:59,900
 Right?

1463
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,100
 - So it's a nephew.

1464
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:02,060
 - Yeah, exactly.

1465
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:04,700
 But it's specifically with your sister's son

1466
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:06,860
 because your sister's son, your nephew,

1467
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:09,540
 is definitely related to you by blood.

1468
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,420
 Because you and your sister have both come

1469
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:12,260
 from the same mother,

1470
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:13,940
 so you are definitely related by blood

1471
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:15,540
 and she has given birth to her son.

1472
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:18,220
 - Yeah, so even if there was hanky-panky going on

1473
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:20,460
 in any of these situations, it's still related.

1474
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:21,300
 - Right.

1475
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,780
 - Like, if my wife has cheated on me,

1476
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,340
 my son might not be my own,

1477
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:27,380
 but my sister's son is definitely related to me by blood.

1478
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:29,940
 So that is a sort of rock solid relationship to form.

1479
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:31,540
 - Yeah, that should be where inheritance goes.

1480
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:34,460
 I'm surprised that's not where inheritance works more often.

1481
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:35,300
 - To the sisters.

1482
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:37,140
 - Yeah, 'cause it's the one you can trust, as you say.

1483
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:37,980
 - Yeah, yeah, you can't trust anyone.

1484
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:39,220
 - We should change the rules.

1485
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:41,060
 (laughing)

1486
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:42,260
 - Mothers in law?

1487
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:43,340
 - Yeah.

1488
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:45,500
 - I just found some famous mothers in law.

1489
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:46,340
 - Okay.

1490
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:47,180
 - Would you remember last time we talked about

1491
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:48,180
 L. Frank Baum's mother-in-law?

1492
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,020
 - We did.

1493
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:50,420
 - Until the Gage.

1494
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:52,580
 So I thought I'd try and find any more notable

1495
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:53,420
 mothers-in-law.

1496
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:54,260
 - Yeah.

1497
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:57,860
 - The mother-in-law of the Marquis de Sade

1498
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:59,780
 was really annoyed with him.

1499
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:00,620
 - Oh, is she?

1500
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:01,460
 - Yeah.

1501
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:02,300
 - Well, a lot of people were.

1502
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:05,140
 - Yeah, he ran off to Italy with his wife's younger sister.

1503
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:06,580
 - Yeah.

1504
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:08,260
 - So she was furious about that.

1505
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:10,020
 Also, she's still her mother-in-law.

1506
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:11,340
 She's the same mother-in-law even with him.

1507
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:12,980
 - You don't need to explain that.

1508
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:13,820
 I think that's--

1509
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:14,660
 - I think you do.

1510
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:15,580
 Why don't you be flattered?

1511
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:17,540
 It's like, don't fancy one of my daughters.

1512
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:18,860
 You fancy both of them.

1513
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:19,700
 - Yeah.

1514
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:20,740
 Well, she got him arrested.

1515
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:22,700
 She helped the authorities hunt him down.

1516
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:23,900
 And he spent most of the rest of his life

1517
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:25,180
 in prison or in asylum.

1518
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:27,260
 But he had also been committing horrible crimes.

1519
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:28,420
 - Yeah.

1520
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:31,060
 Jumping back to the L. Frant Baum very quickly,

1521
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:34,300
 the Tin Man in the movie, he had a son.

1522
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,740
 Do you know who his mother-in-law was?

1523
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:37,580
 - The Tin Man's wife.

1524
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:40,940
 - So the actor who plays the Tin Man has a son.

1525
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:42,580
 Who's his mother-in-law in real life?

1526
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:44,300
 - Well, will it be his wife?

1527
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:45,140
 - His wife's mom.

1528
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:48,780
 - So he got married to someone who had a notable mother.

1529
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:49,620
 Who became his mother-in-law.

1530
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:51,660
 - Dan's quiz feels like the least good of all.

1531
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:52,700
 This is not guessable.

1532
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:53,900
 - It's got the best reveal.

1533
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:55,780
 It was Judy Garland.

1534
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:59,660
 Because Dorothy had a daughter, Liza Minnelli.

1535
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:02,180
 Liza Minnelli married the Tin Man's son.

1536
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:03,620
 - Did not know that that's cool.

1537
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:04,460
 - Yeah.

1538
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:05,300
 - That is cool.

1539
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:06,140
 - There you go.

1540
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:07,620
 - That is quite a good quiz where the questions

1541
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:09,940
 are completely stupid all over the place.

1542
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:11,820
 But the answers are absolutely amazing.

1543
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:13,060
 Isn't that what QI is?

1544
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:15,300
 (laughing)

1545
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:17,880

 (upbeat music)

1547
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,160
 - Okay, that's it.

1548
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:25,160
 That's all of our sexy romantic facts.

1549
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:26,200
