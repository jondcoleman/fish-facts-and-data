00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 - Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.220
 We've got a very exciting one for you today.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.960
 It is our Valentine's Day special.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.380
 So yeah, we've collected together some of the sexiest,

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.820
 most romantic facts that we could possibly find

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.380
 for your listening pleasure.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:16.420
 And we'll be getting to that

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:17.700
 over the course of this episode.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.380
 However, before we get into that,

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.580
 I've just got a quick announcement,

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.020
 which is that we have a live show coming up

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.820
 in July at the Crossed Wires Festival podcast in Sheffield.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.060
 So the Crossed Wires podcast festival is fantastic.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.340
 It debuted last year.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.020
 It was co-created by our good buddy, Alice Levine,

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.460
 from My Dad Wrote a Porno,

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.500
 and they are back this year for round two.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.100
 And really excitingly, she has invited us to be part of it.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.660
 So we will be there to record a live episode

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.780
 at the City Hall on the 6th of July at 2PM.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.180
 And if you wanna come along,

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.980
 you just need to head to knowsuchthingasafish.com/live

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.300
 to get your tickets right now.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.780
 It's gonna be great fun.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.820
 As I say, a live podcast recording

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.020
 with a bunch of silly extra bits thrown in as well.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.100
 And if you get a chance,

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.060
 why not head over to the crossedwires.live website as well.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.020
 That's the address.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.220
 So many great shows are gonna be there this year.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.300
 It's so awesome that these podcast festivals

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.060
 are erupting around the UK.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.180
 Do support them and do come see us.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.380
 We'd love to see you there.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.540
 All right, well, let's get into this week's episode.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.380
 It is our Valentine's Day special.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.340
 Enjoy our sexy, sexy facts on with the show.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.620
 (upbeat music)

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:39.180
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.980
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.580
 a weekly podcast coming to you

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.900
 from the QI offices in Hoburn.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.060
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.940
 I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Anna Tyshinski

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.500
 and Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.740
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.740
 with our four favorite Valentine's Day facts.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.940
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.740
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.420
 - My fact is, before flirting with females,

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.900
 young male dolphins practice on their male friends.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.580
 - Happy Valentine's Day, everyone.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.580
 - Yeah, this is an erotic special.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.140
 - Roses are red, this fact is very blue.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.340
 - It is quite blue, actually.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.180
 - Well, what do they practice?

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.100
 How blue is it?

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.940
 - Well, that's--

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:19.780
 - 'Cause dolphins are blue?

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:20.620
 - Yeah, they're rude.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.460
 - Are they?

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.380
 - Well, they're sort of blueish, aren't they, in cartoons?

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.300
 - Yeah, they're gray, gray blue.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.140
 - They're gray.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.980
 - Bluey gray.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.260
 This is a place that actually is a friend of the podcast.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.940
 It's Shark Bay in Australia,

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.860
 where some research was done.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.820
 We said it was renamed Safety Beach.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:34.660
 - Yeah, we did.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.340
 - Yeah, I think that was fake.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.180
 I think that's a retraction we need to make.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.180
 - Oh, great, okay.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.580
 - Are we all making that as a group?

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.020
 - No, just me, leave it to me.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.620
 You guys, you guys stay unblemished.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.420
 So there's a group of dolphins who've been living there

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.100
 and they've been studying for about 40 years.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.260
 They're really, really well,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.580
 the best-studied group of dolphins in the world.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.380
 They have very complicated social relationships

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.220
 with each other.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.220
 Scientists find it very useful to kind of keep tabs on them.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.460
 And these young males, they pall up in groups of two or three

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.820
 and they coordinate their behavior

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.340
 to consort particular females.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.380
 And that, this is where it gets a bit,

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.980
 flirting is a very nice way of describing it

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.820
 'cause male dolphins sort of coerce

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.700
 and harass individual females

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.900
 and try and separate them from whichever males

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.080
 they're hanging out with.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.740
 But then they do some displays of acrobatics

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:20.700
 and somersaults.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.100
 It sounds like a sort of sea world thing.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.940
 - Uh-huh.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.780
 - You know, they do tricks.

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.460
 They do also bite her sometimes.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.100
 Anyway, they are really getting some mixed signals here.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.620
 I don't want to get all rubbing thickie on your ass.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.580
 - Look at the somersaults, look at the somersaults.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.500
 (laughing)

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.420
 - Yeah, so, but they do practice with each other.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.820
 And the ones who practice with each other

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.420
 have better success later in life.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.620
 Romantically, you know, they farther more offspring

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:47.740
 than the ones that don't.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.780
 - Do they ever fall in love with each other accidentally?

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:51.860
 - Oh my God.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:52.700
 - Good question.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:53.940
 - Flipper three.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.460
 - Reminds me a bit of a Friends episode

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.300
 where Joey helps trigger the janitor to dance.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.180
 He's his dance partner and he sort of starts

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.340
 to wish that he was his real dance partner.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.700
 I wonder if there are dolphins out there

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.940
 who just are like, let's have one more practice.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:07.780
 - I think so.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.660
 I mean, there's lots of, there are occasionally,

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.180
 I find a lot of headlines in the mail,

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.420
 the Daily Mail saying things like,

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.420
 more gay dolphins spotted off Canada

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.180
 like it's very bright and concerned for them.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.020
 - Yeah.

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:19.500
 - Yeah, they can't, they can't be quite aggro,

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.340
 can't they?

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.180
 - Oh yeah.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.520
 - The dolphins.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.860
 And like, but it is sort of their male bonds

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.740
 are sort of nice.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.100
 It does seem like this study, I think,

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.700
 was the first to reveal that they have a buddy system

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.180
 and they'll pick a best friend.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.860
 Some of the males, not all of the males,

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:35.700
 they'll pick a best friend.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.060
 And that'll be someone that they hang out with

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.100
 for their whole life.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.220
 And sometimes you'll have the two male buddies

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.500
 who hang out together.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.420
 And if they're separated for up to decades,

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.060
 I think it is when they come back together,

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.340
 they're their best friends still.

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.460
 - Once there's quite a few ways that dolphins can mate,

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.980
 there's a sort of T-section shape that they do.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.220
 So the male dolphin goes sort of horizontal

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.700
 against the vertical of the female dolphin

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.140
 in order to have sex.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.980
 There's a few other methods.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.780
 One method that gets described for one of the dolphins

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.300
 is having this buddy, the wingman come,

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.260
 and at surface level sort of hold for buoyancy reasons.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.700
 So they're sort of there just to prop him up

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.340
 to make sure the sex can happen.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.220
 Which a lot of NASA scientists are saying

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.860
 that might be the best way that humans will have sex.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.100
 - We're not taking dolphins up to Mars.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.900
 - We're not taking dolphins, we're just screwing like them.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.180
 If sex is happening, there needs to be a third astronaut

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.540
 to come in and just hold everything together.

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.300
 - Dave, Dave, sex is happening.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.140
 Come on in.

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.340
 (all laughing)

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:32.180
 - Surely not.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.540
 - But there was a recent report by someone

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:34.780
 who's trying to work on the problem

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.660
 of population and space. - By a space pervert.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.300
 (all laughing)

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.460
 - I think dolphins are perverts really.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:41.780
 I think by any means.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.580
 - Well, they have sex often with their mothers, male dolphins.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:46.420
 - No.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.180
 - Yeah, bottom-nosed dolphins like to gather

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.860
 around gray whales when they're mating.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.020
 No one really knows why,

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.060
 but they just enjoy watching.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.900
 - Right.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.580
 - You can't get porn underwater.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.660
 - So their mom's nipples are up their butt,

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.940
 so when they breastfeed-- - It is, it is.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.180
 So when they breastfeed, they literally burrow their--

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.020
 - That can't be true.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.860
 - Dolphin noses into the anus of their mom.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:09.940
 - No, that can't be true.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.140
 - It's true.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.980
 - Is it really?

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.380
 - I didn't just come up with that.

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.580
 (all laughing)

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.220
 I mean, it's possible I did just come up with that, but.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.700
 - Okay, can we bust one myth?

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:19.540
 - Yeah, sure.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:21.180
 - This is exciting stuff not to blow wide open,

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.820
 but to close down.

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.740
 And it's a thing we have propagated actually in the past.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:25.900
 So, you know, it's like the rest for us.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.620
 It's the blowhole, the blowhole sex myth.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.460
 - What's the myth that they have sex with their blowholes?

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:33.300
 - Yeah.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.140
 - And we've claimed that.

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:34.980
 - I think so.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:35.820
 - Have we?

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:36.660
 - We're perverts. - A long time ago.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.660
 Like nine years ago, I think, you know,

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:39.500
 we're different people now.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:40.540
 - What's the truth then?

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.980
 - I think, well, there's one mention of it

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.100
 in a paper in 1994.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.100
 - Oh, you shagged one blowhole.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.460
 (all laughing)

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.420
 And the researcher, a researcher called Justin Gregg

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:55.060
 spoke to the person who had authored that 1994 article

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.020
 who said, and I'm quoting here,

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.300
 "With regard to the blowhole,

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.780
 they never inserted the penis entirely."

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.780
 I don't know whether that stands up in court

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:05.620
 and the I'm gonna say.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.540
 - What percentage of the penis?

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.180
 Oh, only 25, that's fine.

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:10.700
 - But they breathe through it.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.860
 Turns out they can breathe through their mouth as well,

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.820
 which we didn't know until 2016.

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.260
 It's assumed that they can't breathe

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:17.980
 because we've never seen them breathing through their mouth.

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:20.980
 But they found one dolphin with a damaged blowhole.

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:21.820
 Blowhole.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:24.220
 (all laughing)

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:25.060
 One of a...

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.560
 Are you being serious?

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.500
 You have a damaged blowhole.

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.100
 (all laughing)

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.420
 - No word.

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:33.260
 Or what?

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.740
 The damage.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.700
 But they found that it was breathing through its mouth

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:38.540
 as a result.

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:40.700
 So possibly even dolphins don't know

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.020
 they can breathe through their mouth.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:42.860
 - Wow.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:43.680
 - Yeah.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:44.500
 - We call them clever.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:45.900
 (all laughing)

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:49.220
 - I feel like everything I've said is a lie so far.

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:50.900
 - Where did you get all this stuff from, Dan?

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.100
 - It's just stuff I know.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.140
 (all laughing)

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.060
 We've talked a lot in the past

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.780
 about dolphins having military connections.

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:00.660
 They've worked with the military a lot.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:01.500
 I didn't know this.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:05.580
 There's like the biggest horde of nuclear weapons

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:08.980
 is in a submarine base in America

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.660
 and it's protected by military dolphins.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.500
 So anyone trying to get access to it

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:14.820
 has to face a dolphin.

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:15.780
 Isn't that amazing?

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:16.620
 And what happens is...

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:17.820
 - Sometimes I think you have your own

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.360
 different Google and their experts.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.460
 (all laughing)

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:22.820
 - Well, the interesting thing is if they...

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:24.060
 So they can't...

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:27.940
 It's very hard to monitor an underwater base

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:28.980
 with nuclear weapons.

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:31.500
 So they need an animal that can just be there

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:32.340
 all the time to do it.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:33.180
 - Where is this?

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:34.020
 Sorry, where...

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:34.860
 - It's near Boston.

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:35.700
 - U.S.

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.580
 - Yeah, you can't give away the exact location,

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:38.420
 I'm sure, Dan.

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:39.460
 - Yeah, sorry, Seattle.

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:40.300
 It's 20 miles.

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:41.140
 - Oh, it's Seattle.

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:41.980
 (all laughing)

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.460
 - 5,000 miles from Boston.

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:45.940
 (all laughing)

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.660
 - It's the world's largest single location

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:48.900
 of our smell of nuclear weapons.

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:49.740
 - Wow, it's underwater.

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:50.740
 - Certainly at the time of writing.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:51.580
 It's underwater, right?

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.260
 And so they have these military dolphins

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:54.500
 and they have this amazing thing

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:55.420
 where if someone's swimming

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.500
 to try and get access to this submarine base

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:01.660
 to steal a nuke of one man just swimming to get to it,

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:03.900
 the dolphins have a metal plate in their mouth

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:06.740
 that when they go up and rub up against the swimmer,

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:08.860
 they can attach like a handcuff,

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.060
 like a subtle handcuff going to your leg.

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:11.900
 - What are you talking about?

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:13.140
 - Honestly, this is what happens.

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:15.900
 It goes around the leg or the arm of the person

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.140
 and then it deploys a boy and floats them,

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:19.300
 like just goes whoop,

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:21.300
 and they just disappear up to the surface.

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.180
 - Were they arrested by a police dolphin at the top?

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.020
 (all laughing)

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:25.700
 - The dolphins are purely underwater based,

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:27.300
 so that becomes a human problem

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:28.140
 when they arrive at the top.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.340
 - Right, that's either extraordinary

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:32.300
 or what are you talking about?

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.420
 - No, that's incredible, unbelievable.

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:36.980
 - This was in 2010, so it's possible the dolphins were fine.

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.940
 - Oh yeah, yeah, they're moving on to par places now.

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:40.980
 - Well, they get seals as well,

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.460
 Navy seals, but like actual seals.

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:46.020
 - Oh yeah, I feel like we have actually mentioned that before.

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:47.900
 We can't just laugh at everything Dan said.

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.100
 - No, from now on though. - Some of it is true.

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.140
 - You gotta start with something more believable, Dan,

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:53.540
 and then build up to this.

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:56.300
 - Well, we know that they do this kind of stuff.

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:58.700
 - It's only Cold War superpowers, isn't it?

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.980
 It's only America and Russia that--

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:02.540
 - That we know of. - That we know of,

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:03.940
 that have trained dolphins.

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:05.380
 - I thought Israel did.

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:06.620
 - Oh yeah, they did, they did.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:07.620
 I'm sure other military powers

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:08.860
 have experimented with all that stuff.

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:09.940
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:11.580
 - You know, paw poises that you mentioned.

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.820
 You know, they're the reason that we call tortoises,

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:15.740
 tortoises. - No.

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.540
 - Which I don't think we've mentioned before,

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:20.420
 but because paw poise,

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:22.220
 which is basically a dolphin-- - I'm highly pregnant here.

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:23.940
 It's a whole show.

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:25.460
 - It does feel a bit like it, doesn't it?

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:27.100
 - No, this is absolutely correct.

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:30.340
 Paw poise, etymologically, it means pigfish,

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:32.740
 so the paw is like, has the same root as pork

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:35.380
 and poise is like, poise on poise, fish.

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:37.340
 Tortoises were always tortoise.

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:38.980
 They ended just in US,

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:41.700
 probably coming from a word meaning twisted.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:44.500
 But once we started having paw poises,

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:47.140
 people went, well, since we spell that like that,

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.060
 should we make it tortoises as well?

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:50.020
 'Cause it sounds similar.

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:51.580
 And we think that's the only theory we have

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.380
 for why suddenly, about 500 years ago,

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.140
 we started spelling tortoise like tortoise.

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:56.980
 - Someone was writing a poem and they're just like--

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:58.820
 (laughing)

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.180
 - I got nothing after tortoise.

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:02.140
 - That was the main economic activity 500 years ago,

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:04.220
 was the sonnet, unfortunately.

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.300
 And so, it was really important.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.380
 - Can we talk about dolphin vaginas?

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:11.020
 - Of course. - Quickly.

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:12.620
 They have clitorises,

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:14.780
 and the clitorises are so accessible

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:15.700
 when they're having sex

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:17.980
 that we think they're probably used for pleasure.

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:18.900
 - Okay.

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.020
 - But the vagina is really,

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:22.380
 it's like, unlike most mammals

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:24.340
 where it's really just like a straight tube,

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:26.580
 with them it goes in all sorts of different directions

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:27.780
 and stuff like that.

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:31.020
 And you can tell what species a dolphin is

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:32.580
 by looking at its vagina.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:33.700
 - It's like a labyrinth,

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:35.700
 so they can decide whether or not

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:38.140
 they want to be impregnated.

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:40.620
 - Sorry, do you mean it's like a maze?

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:43.140
 'Cause of course, a labyrinth only has one root, doesn't it?

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:44.940
 So that wouldn't fool anyone.

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:46.940
 - Labyrinth is like a spiral.

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.060
 - There's no dead ends in a labyrinth.

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:51.580
 - Yes, no, it's a maze, not a labyrinth, sorry.

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:52.700
 - 'Cause we'd get a lot of emails

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.180
 if we left it like that. - You're right, you're right.

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:57.100
 - Can I just very quickly mention

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.100
 the basketball player who had a great altercation

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:00.740
 with the dolphin, Clifford Ray.

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:02.700
 - Oh, okay, yeah. - Can I still about him?

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:06.340
 He became super famous for this in 1978 for a short while.

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.420
 There was a dolphin called Mr. Spock.

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:09.980
 They realized that there was a bolt

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:12.420
 and a really sharp screw stuck in its stomach

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:14.980
 and second stomach down, so quite far in.

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:16.820
 The vet says, "I can't operate to remove it.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:19.660
 "My arm won't reach down its throat enough."

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:21.820
 And then they were like, "Who's got really long arms?

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:23.940
 "This basketball player, Clifford Ray,

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:27.100
 "famously has arms of three foot nine inches long,

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:28.220
 "which is long."

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:29.860
 So they got in touch with Clifford

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:32.180
 and he was at a premier in, for some reason,

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:34.700
 and he was taking a premier in,

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:37.740
 waiting to go to a, you know, to a game.

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:42.020
 And he rocked up and he was guided by speakerphone,

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:44.140
 by an expert in retrieving stuff

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:45.540
 from the insides of dolphins,

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:48.580
 while he inserted his three foot nine inch long arm

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:49.820
 into the dolphin. - And he's like,

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:52.140
 it's like a labyrinth in here.

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:53.740
 - The other end, the other end.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:56.320
 (all laughing)

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.980
 - Why am I holding a nipple?

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:01.740
 (all laughing)

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.540
 - Wait, sorry, why was he on speakerphone?

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:04.460
 'Cause he wasn't there.

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:06.460
 - No, no, sorry, the basketball player was there.

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:08.020
 The vet was-- - The vet?

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:09.540
 - Who needed to guide them?

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:10.820
 The expert vet, who knew all that.

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:13.780
 - You're not gonna turn up to the most interesting

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:15.100
 dolphin-based event of your life.

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.180
 He was staying in the Holiday Inn up in the next town.

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:19.620
 It was too good to make. - My gosh.

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:21.140
 - They didn't have much time.

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:22.780
 - And they said, once his arm was in,

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:24.180
 it was three minutes, and after that,

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:25.340
 the dolphin would suffocate.

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:27.340
 And he had to get all the way down, wave his arm.

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:28.460
 - Wait, he's got a bow hole?

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:29.300
 - What?

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:30.140
 - He's got a bow hole?

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:30.980
 - It'd have been dumb.

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:33.580
 (all laughing)

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:36.020
 - There's four dolphins.

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:38.540
 - It turns out there's just one dolphin in the world.

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:40.220
 There's this guy.

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:42.620
 - Can I ask a question, if they're short on time,

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:44.220
 the dolphin is obviously in one place.

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.460
 They immediately go, who's got long arms

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:49.940
 in the immediate vicinity, and he happens to be in town?

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:51.980
 - Well, he's from California, so it was the same state.

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:52.940
 - Okay, right.

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:54.500
 - And they needed really long arms.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:55.340
 - Right.

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:56.260
 - Like, not just like you're a bit tall.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:57.620
 - Mr. Tickle was embossed.

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:00.420
 (all laughing)

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:01.700
 - Wait, he did it, he did it.

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:04.220
 He did it with only, when there were 15 seconds to spare,

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:06.660
 he says he just remembers the vet on the other end of the line.

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:10.100
 - Did they have a big basketball club ticking down?

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.940
 - Come on, time out.

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.860
 (all laughing)

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:16.460
 - What if he didn't, he would die.

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:17.300
 - Would have suffocated him.

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:19.580
 - And did Mr. Spock live long and prosper?

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:21.340
 - Hey, there we go.

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.180
 - And there we go.

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:24.740
 - A gentle end to a very upsetting story.

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:26.420
 (all laughing)

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:29.000
 (upbeat music)

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.820
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:36.740
 - My fact this week is that the adult

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:38.740
 who's come closest to freezing to death

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:40.420
 and being brought back to life,

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:43.740
 got together with the person who resuscitated her.

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:44.580
 - Mmm.

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:48.220
 - Was it Anna from Frozen?

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:49.260
 - It should have been.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.900
 - Maybe that's who Anna from Frozen was named after.

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:52.740
 - It is not, it is Anna.

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:53.780
 - 'Cause she is called Anna, isn't it?

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:55.100
 - Yes, yes.

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:56.220
 - Anna Bagenholm.

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:58.580
 - Anna Bagenholm, who's Swedish,

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:00.020
 but she was in Norway at the time.

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:02.260
 This is, I don't know why I'm speaking like that.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:06.060
 This was 1999, and she was skiing with two colleagues.

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:07.180
 And it's just the most amazing story,

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:08.340
 so I'll do a short version,

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:10.220
 and then we'll probably do a long version.

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:12.660
 Basically, she's skiing, she plunges head first

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:14.860
 through a massive layer of ice,

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:17.660
 and she's stuck there for ages and ages,

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:20.780
 and she gets very bad hypothermia,

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:23.660
 her heart stops beating, her breathing stops, she's dead.

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:25.220
 She's completely dead.

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:27.940
 And then eventually she gets extracted from the ice.

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:31.060
 And the crucial thing that happens as soon as she's extracted,

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:32.180
 and very important to remember this

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:33.660
 for any hypothermia sufferers,

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:35.940
 is that she received CPR straight away

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:38.580
 from her two colleagues who've been skiing with her.

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:42.100
 One of whom was a chap called Torvind Nysheim,

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:43.940
 who gave her CPR,

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:45.540
 and it seemed to have absolutely no effect at the time.

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:47.220
 - The other one's going, "Let it go!"

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:48.060
 - Oh, my God.

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:49.180
 - Oh, Jesus Christ.

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:54.740
 James is poised to use that in the body as possible,

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:56.860
 but have you got that out of your system?

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:58.740
 Yeah? No more famous lyrics than that?

00:15:58.740 --> 00:15:59.860
 - I don't know any of this.

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:02.780
 - Okay, I think that's a relief for everyone.

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:05.340
 Anyway, it's thought the CPR probably saved her life,

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:07.100
 along with a bunch of other incredible doctors.

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:07.940
 When she got to hospital,

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:10.300
 there were over a hundred doctors in the room,

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:12.260
 or medical staff in the room with her.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.540
 And she did live, and then a few years later,

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:17.460
 she got together with this chap.

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:20.780
 And I believe, as of 2022, they were still together.

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:21.780
 - Oh, lovely.

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:23.820
 - But really, this was a way of crowbaring

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:26.420
 this amazing story into a Valentine's special.

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:27.740
 - Yeah, it is an amazing story.

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:29.020
 And at that time, they thought,

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:30.180
 "No way she's coming back."

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:31.780
 For all the doctors, she was literally,

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:34.100
 this was medicine into the unknown, right?

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:37.140
 It was, that's a Frozen 2 song, just for you all there.

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:37.980
 - It wasn't.

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:38.900
 - Medicine into the unknown.

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:39.940
 Oh, into the unknown, sorry.

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:41.660
 Medicine into the unknown.

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:44.060
 (laughing)

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:46.620
 - Frozen 2, she becomes a GP, she, yeah.

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:49.060
 - There's a polar bear who's swallowed a plastic bag,

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:52.340
 and we need the world's best curling team

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:53.740
 to go and get it out.

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:56.460
 - This was a phenomenal thing.

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:58.620
 They thought, "No way is she gonna survive,"

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:01.020
 except they seem to have a phrase there, the doctors,

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:02.060
 which is something like,

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:04.300
 "You're not dead until we warm you up first."

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.780
 So no one who's cold can be declared dead.

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:08.420
 You've got to bring them back to war.

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:09.860
 - I think that's true around the world,

00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:12.420
 and it's a really crucial thing about being that cold,

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:15.860
 because, again, this is what a lot of hypothermia sites say.

00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:17.980
 They're like, "Don't assume they're dead, no heart rate,

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:20.380
 "no breathing, pallid skin, why is she,

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:22.700
 "but it could be that once you warm them up again,

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:23.540
 "you come back to life."

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:24.940
 - It's like a goldfish, isn't it?

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:26.860
 If your goldfish is floating upside down,

00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:27.700
 it might not be dead.

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:29.220
 It might just have a swim bladder problem.

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:30.060
 - Is that so?

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:30.900
 - Yeah.

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:31.740
 - So don't flush it down the toilet.

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:32.580
 - That's really good advice.

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:34.020
 - And in the same way with these people.

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:36.460
 - Yeah, don't flush them down, as they do.

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:38.980
 Ignore it when they're done.

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:41.260
 - So this accident she had, she was skiing,

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.460
 she had a fall, she went through a hole in the ice,

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:46.540
 eight inches of ice, thick ice,

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:48.700
 and she was trapped under the water.

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:49.860
 Her clothes are immediately soaked,

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.780
 therefore they're very heavy.

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:54.420
 The shock paralyzes your muscles, so you can't move, right?

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:56.740
 So her friends catch up with her, they--

00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:58.940
 - And they can only see her feet in skiing, can they?

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:00.580
 - They can only see her feet, they cannot pull her out,

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.660
 because just the position she's in.

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:05.020
 - And also just this is, 'cause she's in the water,

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:07.820
 she's submerged, it's a random air pocket

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:09.980
 that her face happens to be next to

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:11.740
 that allows for her to keep breathing in there.

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:13.700
 - It's stunning, so she's breathing for seven minutes,

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.620
 but she's in the water for 40 minutes.

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:19.180
 A team of rescuers arrive, they can't get her out

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:20.540
 with a rope or a snow shovel,

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:21.780
 it's not thick enough to get through the ice.

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:25.140
 So she's there, I think another 30 or 40 minutes.

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:25.980
 - Another 40 minutes, yeah.

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.980
 - And then a team arrives with a pointy shovel,

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:30.020
 which they use to dig through the ice and get her out.

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:34.220
 So she's been in the water for 80 minutes freezing.

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:37.700
 She's white, she's cold, nothing, nothing is happening.

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:38.820
 It's just extraordinary.

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:40.180
 - It's amazing. - Well, she's dead.

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:41.020
 - She's dead. - She's dead.

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:42.460
 - She's dead, well, except she's not.

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:44.540
 - Well, I mean, what's the definition of death?

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:46.460
 - Exactly, is she warm?

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:48.020
 I don't think so, guys.

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:49.340
 - Good point, good point.

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:51.380
 She had no heartbeat for four hours

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:52.900
 between when her head went through the ice

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:54.460
 and when her heart rate came back.

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:56.740
 - Extraordinary, and it was like nine hours,

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:59.180
 and they say like hundreds of doctors and nurses

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.700
 who were just working on her the entire time,

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:04.020
 just trying to bring her back, and they did it.

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:07.020
 And when they did, she was paralyzed to begin with

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:10.180
 and pissed off, so why did you bring me back?

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:11.700
 Why did you make me become alive again?

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:12.700
 I now have to live a life

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:15.180
 where I'm not gonna be the person that I wanted to be.

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:17.500
 And she eventually calmed down.

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.060
 - Well, after she realized she wasn't paralyzed.

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:19.900
 - It took a long time, though,

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:22.300
 for her to get her body completely back to normal.

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:23.860
 - I think it was within not too long, actually.

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:25.020
 And then she did apologize.

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:27.460
 So, yeah, not the romantic reunion initially

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.020
 with poor old Naishim, who's like,

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:30.980
 "Oh, she's gonna fall in love with me now," in her eyes.

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:32.860
 - And then her heart melted.

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:35.300
 - Ah, it's Valentine's Day.

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:36.600
 - I love it.

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:39.340
 - The thing, I find it nuts is she's skewed again.

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:40.180
 - Absolute loon.

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:41.780
 She's really into downhill skiing.

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:43.140
 - Six years later, she's skewed again.

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:43.980
 Just extraordinary.

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:46.380
 - Did she stay on peace from that one?

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:47.220
 - I don't know.

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:48.060
 - No, I think she's into--

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:49.660
 - She just went to the cafe a bit.

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:51.740
 (all laughing)

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:53.980
 - I believe she's really into extreme skiing still.

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:54.820
 - Really?

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:55.780
 - Because people are insane.

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:57.740
 - Can we say what she got down to?

00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:02.580
 So, normally, your core temperature is 37 degrees, right?

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:05.660
 If your core goes down below 35,

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:08.180
 you're officially in hypothermia.

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:13.180
 Her core temperature went down to 13.7 degrees Celsius.

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:17.260
 - And then a bit later, there was a kid who went to 13,

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:19.540
 who's the coldest anyone has ever been.

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:20.500
 - Yeah.

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:24.340
 - And apparently, this is more common to work in children.

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:26.180
 This idea of sort of freezing yourself

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:27.300
 and then coming back to life.

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:30.780
 And it's because you have a greater surface area

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:32.140
 compared to your volume,

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:34.420
 which means that you cool down a lot quicker.

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:36.060
 - Oh, of course, and that's why--

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:38.060
 - And you wanna do that quick freezing at the start.

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:38.900
 That's kind of how it works.

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:40.500
 - So, that's why you need to keep babies warm at night

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:42.220
 'cause they cool down faster.

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.940
 So, the thing is when you get really, really cold,

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:48.180
 the oxygen demand of your brain lowers drastically.

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:51.660
 And if you're cold enough before your heart stops,

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:52.700
 that's the key.

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:54.500
 That's why doing the CPR is so important.

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:56.820
 Then the cell death, which normally happens

00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:59.340
 when you don't have any circulation, it doesn't happen.

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:01.340
 So, her brain needed no oxygen, basically.

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:02.780
 - I think it was like, it had 10%

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:05.020
 of the oxygen requirements of your brain normally.

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:05.860
 - Oh, sorry, go on.

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:07.820
 - Well, just to say that because this happened,

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:11.300
 they're now using the idea of freezing people down.

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:14.700
 If people have had a stroke or if they've had liver failure

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:15.940
 or something like that,

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:18.860
 the idea now is get people really, really, really cold

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:20.420
 and they might survive.

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:23.820
 - Yes, and in fact, even though it's quite standard now

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:24.820
 or it's done a lot,

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:27.060
 but we actually don't know why it works.

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:29.020
 And they think that actually,

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:31.060
 it's not about the effects of your heart stopping,

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:34.020
 which deprives your brain of oxygen.

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:36.340
 It's actually about when your heart starts again.

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:38.700
 And I didn't know this, but if you have a heart attack

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:40.300
 or if your heart stops,

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:42.260
 one of the really common ways that you die

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:44.100
 is when your heart starts again.

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:46.660
 And it's this thing called reperfusion.

00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:49.500
 And it means that if your heart's been stopped for long enough,

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:52.380
 then all the chemistry in your brain has changed so much

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:54.420
 in ways that they don't quite understand.

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:56.820
 If blood suddenly floods back in there,

00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:58.540
 it completely messes it up and you die.

00:21:58.540 --> 00:21:59.380
 - Oh, wow.

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:00.820
 - And so in this way,

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:02.980
 I think it allows that to happen much more gradually

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:04.180
 or it slows the brain down

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:06.060
 and allows it to be a bit more controlled.

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:08.580
 - Is the word reaper a deliberate use there

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:11.180
 of the danger, reperfusion?

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:13.220
 - No, it's not reperfusion.

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:14.420
 - I see, it's not that-- - I think it's probably

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:16.140
 just reperfusion again. - Perfusion with the ray

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:16.980
 on the front.

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:18.140
 - Yeah, the standard prefix, re.

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:18.980
 - Interesting.

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:21.020
 - It should put the A in though.

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:23.660
 Did you guys read about the two things that happen

00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:26.220
 when you have hypothermia that are most bizarre?

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:27.500
 - Oh, yeah, yes.

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:29.500
 If someone has died of hypothermia,

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:31.260
 you shouldn't just look on the floor,

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:34.540
 look in all the crevices and look in all the shelving units

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:35.980
 because they might be curled up in there

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:38.260
 because it's a reaction. - Terminal burrowing.

00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:39.740
 - Terminal burrowing, yeah.

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:40.900
 That was interesting.

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:42.340
 The other one is taking your clothes off, isn't it?

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:43.980
 - Yes, and it seems to happen a lot.

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:45.260
 There was one study that was done that looked,

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:47.980
 I think, about 70 people who died of hypothermia

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:49.780
 and it found almost all of them

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:51.860
 did this thing called terminal burrowing,

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:54.940
 which, as you say, is where you crawl under a bed

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:57.740
 or behind a cupboard or onto a shelf.

00:22:57.740 --> 00:22:58.860
 And it just feels like, you know,

00:22:58.860 --> 00:22:59.980
 when you have a cat who's dying,

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:02.300
 it crawls to the very corner under a bed.

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:04.700
 It's like the last protective hibernation thing.

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:05.940
 - Like a really deep instinct, basically.

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:06.980
 - Yes, deep.

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:09.300
 And the other thing that a quarter of the people did

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:11.620
 was this thing called paradoxical undressing,

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:13.100
 which, again, people who've had hypothermia

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:15.660
 often found completely naked.

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:18.100
 And that's because, at first, you know,

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:20.780
 you have vasodilation where all your veins

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:22.380
 in your extremities constricts

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:24.660
 to try and flood blood to your internal organs

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:26.260
 to keep you warm when you've got hypothermia.

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:27.900
 But then that takes loads and loads of effort

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:29.940
 for your muscles and your body just gives up.

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:31.540
 All the blood floods back to your extremities

00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:32.500
 and so suddenly you're like,

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:34.420
 "God, bizarrely, I'm really hot."

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:36.220
 And you take off all your clothes.

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:37.140
 So hot.

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:39.380
 - So maybe the song that's getting hot in here

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:41.420
 is actually the last throes of someone

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:42.860
 who's suffering severe hypothermia.

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:43.940
 - That's what it's about, yeah.

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:46.500
 - Yeah, the lyric is from Scott's diary, isn't it?

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:47.340
 (laughing)

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:49.920
 (upbeat music)

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:55.020
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:56.780
 and that is James.

00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:58.900
 - Okay, my fact this week is that if ancient

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:01.860
 Mesopotamia had Valentine's cards,

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:04.660
 they would probably contain pictures of knees.

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:07.620
 - So we've had the flirting,

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:10.020
 we've now got together with Torvind,

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:11.740
 and now we're sending each other Valentine's cards.

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:12.780
 - Now we're on our knees.

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:14.180
 - We should've done it the other way around, shouldn't we?

00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:15.260
 You don't send a Valentine's card

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:16.300
 once you've got together with someone.

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:18.100
 - Anna, this is exactly what I said to these guys

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:19.180
 before we came on air.

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:20.140
 - And I disagree, Anna.

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:21.220
 I think it's much more common.

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:23.300
 I think most Valentine's cards are bought by people

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:27.180
 joylessly on the 13th of February in a train station.

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:29.820
 (laughing)

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:31.700
 - I thought you always put, like,

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:34.060
 from anonymous on your Valentine's cards,

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:35.580
 that's the whole point of them.

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:37.140
 - I put anonymous on all the ones I send,

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:38.340
 apart from the one to my wife.

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:41.100
 (laughing)

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:42.180
 - Should I explain the fact?

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:43.020
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:45.060
 - So this is a new study about,

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:48.100
 they looked at a load of cuneiform texts.

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:51.260
 This is some scientists at the University of Finland,

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:54.020
 and they looked at loads of phrases

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:55.580
 that are about emotions,

00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:57.900
 and they looked at what parts of the body

00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:00.020
 were used in those phrases.

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:03.300
 And they found that happiness is mostly felt

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:05.420
 in the liver, for instance.

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:07.820
 Shard and Freud are mostly in the lip.

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:09.780
 - Amazing that Shard and Freud was on the list

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:11.340
 of what was a really basic,

00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:14.340
 it was like happy, sad, anger, Shard and Freud are.

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:15.660
 - On the lip?

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:16.820
 - On the lip, yeah.

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:17.980
 - You kind of curl your lip.

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:21.660
 - And they found that love was in order,

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:25.340
 in the knee, liver, heart, back, and male genitalia.

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:28.100
 - Sounds about right.

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:30.140
 - That's like that song, my neck, my back.

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:32.380
 - It's like, head, shoulder, knee, my liver.

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:35.020
 - Like, head, shoulders, knees and toes.

00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:37.660
 Knee, liver, heart and back, genitalia.

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:41.380
 - I would struggle to pinpoint where my liver was,

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:42.820
 as in if I wouldn't know where to say

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:44.220
 if I was feeling something in my liver.

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:46.100
 - The reason that that is a thing is that

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:48.980
 when you open up a body after someone's died,

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:51.340
 the liver is so big compared to everything else,

00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:53.180
 you would naturally think that was a really important

00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:54.020
 part of the body.

00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:56.780
 - I'm just really impressed that they had that knowledge of,

00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:58.420
 as in like, that knowledge was widespread,

00:25:58.420 --> 00:25:59.340
 that that was a phrase.

00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:00.740
 - Well, they didn't know where it was, I suppose,

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:01.820
 necessarily if you were an ordinary guy.

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:03.100
 You'd just say, like, in the same way,

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:04.580
 I'd say my heart bleeds for you,

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:06.020
 and that would, I guess, show sympathy

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:07.140
 and you'd say it's associated with the heart.

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:10.180
 You might say, oh, my liver erupts with rage.

00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:12.820
 But it is true, the liver seems to have been the heart

00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:16.140
 for hundreds and hundreds of years and loads of civilizations.

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:18.580
 And they had, it was so important that they thought

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:21.540
 that gods imprinted their desires on livers.

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:23.180
 So, and this is in ancient Mesopotamia,

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:26.340
 but when you sacrifice a sheep, let's say,

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:28.460
 its liver would then be taken out

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:30.380
 and they used to make clay liver models

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:32.060
 of the exact shape of the liver

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:34.260
 that that sheep had had inside it.

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:35.780
 And then they would analyze the models

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:38.140
 like you'd read a poem and that would tell them the future.

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:41.420
 'Cause they thought the god will have put their desire

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:44.260
 and the future onto the liver shape of this sheep.

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:45.820
 - But how do you know you've got the right sheep?

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:47.180
 It just feels like a very inefficient system.

00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:49.100
 - I think God knows, I think maybe God changes the shape

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:50.380
 as it's being sacrificed.

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:52.060
 So God sees that you're sacrificing that sheep

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:54.220
 and then quickly molds the liver into that shape.

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:55.500
 I'm not sure exactly that logic.

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:57.460
 - No, we shouldn't, we shouldn't try.

00:26:57.460 --> 00:26:59.260
 Where is Mesopotamia again, is it Turkey?

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:00.100
 - Iraq.

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:01.300
 - Iraq, yeah.

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:04.660
 And we're talking 2,500 BC-ish.

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:05.500
 - Long time ago.

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:06.980
 - Oh, it's a very long time ago.

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:07.820
 But this is--

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:08.660
 - That is civilization.

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:09.500
 - It sort of is.

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:11.780
 We're all this writing these cuneiform tablets.

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:13.460
 And so we keep finding out more and more about it

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:14.380
 'cause more are found.

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:15.620
 They've survived the test of time.

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:17.860
 These amazing clay tablets that are found

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:19.620
 in their hundreds and thousands in hordes

00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:20.460
 whenever they--

00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:21.300
 - It's 'cause they're made of clay, right?

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:22.140
 - Exactly, yeah, it was--

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:24.620
 - Not like Balencian's cards.

00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:27.380
 - Exactly, for all we know, there were millions of them.

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:29.460
 So it was a huge trade back then.

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:31.620
 'Cause it was thought up until recently

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:35.500
 that 1,500 BC was when we started kissing.

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:37.180
 - You mean the oldest depiction we found

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:38.940
 or we actually found a couple locked in--

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:41.100
 - No, the oldest depiction of it.

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:43.060
 But actually we now have records via cuneiform

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:45.620
 that show us that back then they were very romantic

00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:47.660
 and they were kissing and not just within marriage,

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:51.740
 they were also kissing as dates and socially and so on.

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:54.460
 And there's only one other major contestant

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:57.060
 to say that it's older, which is a kiss

00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:59.100
 that may have happened between a Neanderthal

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:01.780
 and a human over 100,000 years ago.

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:04.620
 And they know this because they found a microbe inside

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:09.020
 on the skull of a human, but you would only get it

00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:09.860
 from a Neanderthal.

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:12.260
 So they know that a bit of tonsil hockey was going on.

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:13.900
 - Well, they were playing that game where you--

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:15.580
 - Pass a balloon. - Pass a egg, pass a balloon.

00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:16.900
 - Oh, an egg. - An egg?

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:19.420
 - You pass on, is it not an egg from one mouth to the next?

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:20.260
 What did you think it was?

00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:21.380
 - It was of a big mouth.

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:22.220
 - Those are quite big.

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:23.740
 - Yeah, you could do it with a quail's egg.

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:25.460
 But again, that's quite socially restrictive.

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:26.980
 - Was it like scrambled or poached

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:28.940
 or the kind of egg which is--

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:30.260
 - I'm thinking in shell.

00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:31.500
 I'm sure we did it with eggs.

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:33.020
 - I mean, you can fit an egg in your mouth,

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:34.220
 but it is a choking hazard,

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:35.780
 I would say. - Oh, yeah.

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:37.740
 It's not sexy, I think.

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:39.820
 Ugh, it's locked behind my teeth.

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:41.100
 (laughing)

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:42.620
 - I've misunderstood the rules.

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:43.460
 - That's very funny.

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:44.620
 That's, yeah.

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:46.900
 I mean, we say I go weak at the knees.

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:48.740
 - Yes, exactly, I was thinking that, yeah.

00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:51.420
 Yeah, I think knees would be in our list of things.

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:54.780
 The weird thing I found was under sexual attraction,

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:57.500
 which was one of the simple emotions they had.

00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:59.780
 The six body parts, was it five?

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:02.060
 Five body parts associated with that.

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:04.100
 Well, what would you guess was in there?

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:06.020
 Eyes, you would think, right?

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:07.980
 - I would have thought, firstly, genitals.

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:09.340
 I mean, genitals feature so much

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:10.740
 in so many other emotions,

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:13.540
 like kind of distress or contempt.

00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:16.780
 Sexual attraction, genitals and penis aren't in there.

00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:19.180
 It's head, knee, neck, hand and ankle.

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:23.660
 - Head, knee, knee, neck, neck and ankle.

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:25.180
 - Ankle's a bit of an odd one, isn't it?

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:27.180
 - Well, like Victorians.

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:28.540
 Like Chilbert and Ankle.

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:31.140
 - Yeah, if you've got restrictive social practices.

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:32.620
 - What period are we talking about?

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:33.780
 - This is the same study.

00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:34.620
 - This is ancient Mesopotamia.

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:35.460
 - Oh, right.

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:37.180
 'Cause there's a whole subcategory now

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:39.540
 of celebrity spotting on celebrities' knees.

00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:40.460
 - Not that period.

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:41.500
 We're not looking at that period.

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:42.900
 - Is it like wiki knees or something?

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:45.180
 - No, it's like how if we look at a sort of photo

00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:46.500
 of Meghan Markle, you'll see Casper,

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:48.660
 the friendly ghost's face on her knee.

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:50.500
 - Oh, there was a thing where,

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:52.180
 oh no, I'm getting it wrong.

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:54.180
 I thought Sandy Tuxwick might have been on someone's knees.

00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:55.380
 - She was, exactly.

00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:56.220
 Yeah, yeah.

00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:58.700
 There's a lot of faces that are appearing on knees recently.

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:00.060
 - I would presume it's normally,

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:02.660
 I mean, no disrespect to the glorious Sandy.

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:04.300
 It's normally people with quite wrinkly faces

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:06.620
 who are being spotted in other people's knees.

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:07.460
 - No.

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:08.500
 - It surely is very rarely,

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:10.380
 'cause knees are knobbly, you know, wrinkly.

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:11.220
 - Wrinkly?

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:12.540
 My knees are perfectly smooth.

00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:13.380
 - Oh. - Yeah.

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:14.220
 - Casper the friendly ghost,

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:15.060
 doesn't ever notice that.

00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:17.300
 - Anna, you've been having routine knee Botox knees.

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:19.140
 (laughing)

00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:21.540
 - Knees, they have a lot of nerve endings.

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:23.820
 So they are known as an erogenous zone.

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:26.100
 And that's because you have nerves that go through your knee

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:27.980
 that do everything that in your feet

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:29.740
 and up at the top of your thighs as well.

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:31.300
 Basically, all the nerves that are in your leg

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:32.460
 have to go through your knees.

00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:34.260
 So they have a lot of nerve endings.

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:35.100
 - That's good.

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:36.860
 - And the attraction to knees,

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:40.980
 the paraphilia of that is called genufilia.

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:41.940
 - Oh, like genuflecting?

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:43.300
 - Exactly, yeah.

00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:44.580
 Do you want some more of those, by the way?

00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:45.420
 - Yes, please.

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:49.780
 - Alvin O'Lagnea is the attraction to--

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:51.740
 - Alvin, a chipmunk, I can eat.

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:53.500
 (laughing)

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.020
 - It's the midriff.

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:55.860
 - Okay.

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:57.420
 - The belly button and tummy and stuff.

00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:58.260
 - Nice.

00:30:58.260 --> 00:30:59.980
 - Bro midophilia.

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:00.820
 - Bro.

00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:01.660
 - Yeah, it's like--

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:02.500
 - Podcasters.

00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:03.660
 (laughing)

00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:05.980
 - It's the attraction to body odor.

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:06.820
 - Oh, wow.

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:10.060
 - And matiaphilia is tough.

00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:14.740
 It's the attraction to non-normal looking eyes.

00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:17.620
 And it comes from the Greek term for the evil eye.

00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:18.460
 - Hard.

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:20.420
 - Like those dogs that have one eye of different colors.

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:21.860
 - Like David Bowie, I guess.

00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:22.700
 - And like David Bowie.

00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:23.540
 - Quite a few of those.

00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:25.420
 I would think of not sort of unnatural attractions,

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:27.740
 like midriffs, you know, a traditionally,

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:28.580
 a slightly sexy thing.

00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:29.420
 So I've got the midriff out.

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:31.420
 - It's interesting 'cause a paraffilia by definition

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:34.420
 should be attraction to something atypical.

00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:36.660
 But then when you look at the list,

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:38.940
 there was one which is normalphilia,

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:41.300
 which is the attraction to normal things.

00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:42.140
 (laughing)

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:42.980
 - Right.

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:44.700
 - So is that normal things to be attracted to

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:46.020
 or normal things like a table?

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:46.860
 (laughing)

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:47.700
 That is unusual.

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:48.540
 - Oh, that is unusual.

00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:50.260
 Then yeah, I read one earlier today, weirdly,

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:52.420
 nothing to do with this about being sexually attracted

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:54.060
 to people falling downstairs.

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:54.900
 (laughing)

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:55.740
 - What?

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:57.340
 - And that's why you always sit down to watch an episode

00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:58.340
 you'd be afraid of.

00:31:58.340 --> 00:31:59.700
 (laughing)

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:01.420
 - His pants around his ankles.

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:03.340
 (laughing)

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:04.580
 - Setting my family out of the room.

00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:06.020
 - Right, everyone out.

00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:08.940
 - If you've got any videos of yourself falling downstairs

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:11.340
 and send it to dad and he'll give you 250 pounds.

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:13.580
 (laughing)

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:18.140
 - All right, here's a little micro quiz.

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:21.380
 Which of these phrases is the oldest?

00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:23.100
 I'm gonna give you three.

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:24.620
 To have someone over your knee.

00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:27.260
 - Like to spank them kind of thing.

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:28.260
 - That's the implication.

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:29.100
 - Right.

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:30.780
 - A knee slapper.

00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:31.620
 - That's a joke.

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:32.460
 - That's a joke.

00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:35.020
 And upon the knees of the gods.

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:36.140
 - Oh, I don't know what that one means.

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:38.060
 So that's why I would say that would be the oldest

00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:38.900
 'cause I've never heard of it.

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:40.220
 - Okay.

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:41.780
 - Do you mean thigh slapper?

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:42.820
 I've never heard of a knee slapper.

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:44.020
 - A knee slapper is the phrase.

00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:44.860
 - Is it?

00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:45.700
 - Yeah.

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:46.540
 I think thigh slapper too.

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:47.380
 Depends on how funny the joke is.

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:48.220
 - Of course.

00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:49.060
 - Well, how long your legs were?

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:49.900
 - And what you wearing?

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:51.340
 (laughing)

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:52.700
 - For that basketball player,

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:54.020
 it was an ankle slapper.

00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:55.900
 (laughing)

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:56.740
 - Okay.

00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:58.460
 James is saying upon the knees of the gods is oldest.

00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:00.460
 - Probably knee slapper, I reckon.

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:01.540
 - Yeah, I'm gonna say knee slapper as well

00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:03.060
 because I'll do the third one

00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:04.700
 just for the sake of having a full house.

00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:05.860
 - To have someone over your knee.

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:07.260
 - Yeah.

00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:10.020
 - Upon the knees of the gods is ancient Greek.

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:10.860
 - What does it mean?

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:12.020
 - Well, that's what one would have get.

00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:13.260
 - Yeah, that was the obvious one, Andy.

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:14.380
 - Yeah, well, James got there first.

00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:17.860
 So maybe you two should fuck up your ideas a bit next time.

00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:19.420
 - You'd be great in a quiz, Dan.

00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:21.140
 It's like, what is the capital of France?

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:21.980
 Paris.

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:23.620
 Oh, that was the obvious answer, guys.

00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:25.100
 - We knew that as well, actually.

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:26.420
 - It did feel like Andy would be pulling

00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:28.060
 some sort of rock up run for our feet

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:29.020
 rather than just going.

00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:29.980
 - No, I'm a nice guy.

00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:30.980
 I leave the rock under your feet.

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:32.460
 - Right, okay.

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:33.380
 - It's the one you're thinking of

00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:34.980
 is the title of my quiz format.

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:37.300
 (laughing)

00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:39.700
 It's an ancient Greek phrase, theon engounasi,

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:41.580
 which means it's beyond human control.

00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:43.180
 It's like it's in the lap of the gods, actually,

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:44.780
 but it's on the knees of the gods.

00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:47.540
 Okay, a knee slapper is from 1955

00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:50.220
 and to have someone over your knee takes to 1866,

00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:51.040
 which is quite something

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:54.180
 that someone used that phrase on me recently.

00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:55.740
 - Say the phrase again?

00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:56.940
 - To have someone over your knee.

00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:58.180
 - And someone used that on you?

00:33:58.180 --> 00:33:59.860
 - Yeah, it was a removals guy

00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:01.460
 the last time I was moving in the house.

00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:02.300
 - Yeah.

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:05.180
 - I'd left something at the bottom of the staircase, right?

00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:06.020
 'Cause I was moving down the--

00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:07.180
 - That's how they fall down the stairs.

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:09.900
 (laughing)

00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:11.660
 - You haven't sent me that video yet, by the way.

00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:12.900
 I'd paid good money for that.

00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:14.460
 - I'd put like a glass picture frame

00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:15.420
 at the bottom of the stairs

00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:17.620
 and I hadn't moved it out to the van or whatever.

00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:19.740
 And he said, "I'd have you over my knee

00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:20.940
 if you were one of my boys."

00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:22.200
 - It was a whole unusual thing.

00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:25.180
 - It was much nicer than the way he made it sound.

00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:26.720
 - I also think that this whole quiz

00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:28.880
 is leading up to that anecdote.

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:29.720
 - Yeah.

00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:30.560
 - How could you think that?

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:32.000
 (laughing)

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.660
 - When the anecdote was so bad.

00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:35.280
 (laughing)

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.300
 - Unless there's one extra bit you're not telling us.

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:38.140
 - Nope.

00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:38.980
 - Okay.

00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:40.400
 - That's the subtitle of the quiz.

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:42.340
 - That's all there is to it.

00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:43.920
 - That's all there is to it.

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:46.680
 - Um, here's a song from Chicago,

00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:48.400
 which I won't sing, but I'll read you the lyrics.

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:49.640
 - The band Chicago.

00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:51.020
 - Or the musical Chicago.

00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:51.860
 - The musical.

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:53.200
 - No, the city.

00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:54.300
 (laughing)

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:55.660
 - That's a buster, isn't it?

00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:56.780
 - The pizza company.

00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:59.060
 Um, okay, so it's from the musical.

00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:01.740
 Why don't we paint the town and all that jazz?

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:05.960
 I'm gonna rouge my knees and roll my stockings down.

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:07.000
 - Yep.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.060
 - That's weird, isn't it?

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:10.220
 - Yes, why do they, I've never questioned that before.

00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:12.140
 I'm gonna rouge my knees.

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:12.980
 Hmm.

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:13.820
 - Carpet burn.

00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:15.280
 - It's not carpet burn, Dan.

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:16.380
 Like, why would you,

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:18.700
 why you'd be deliberately faking a carpet burn

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:20.260
 on your knees with rouge?

00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:21.600
 - Well, that's pretty sexy, isn't it?

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:22.440
 - Yeah.

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:23.960
 - You wanna know how I got these knees?

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:24.800
 I'll never tell.

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:28.920
 - So yeah, rouge as in makeup, red makeup.

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:33.920
 And this was a popular thing in the flapper period,

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:36.380
 which was to put makeup on your knees.

00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:38.640
 - Like a little face.

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.240
 - In actual fact, sometimes they put,

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:43.600
 there were some images of young women

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:46.800
 with quite short skirts and with little faces on their knees.

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:49.580
 - Is that one because it's soundly toxic on both knees?

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:50.980
 - That's good flirting.

00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:51.940
 I think that's really good flirting.

00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:54.180
 If you're opposite someone on a train, for example,

00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:56.540
 you just, whoop, you hook up your skirt a little bit.

00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:58.420
 There's your winking face on your knee.

00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:00.420
 And then you, you know, you see if they notice.

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:02.060
 - Yeah, it's good.

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:02.900
 - Isn't that good?

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:04.380
 I'm sorry, that's creative flirting.

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:05.780
 - If you're pulling up your kill

00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:07.500
 to say that it's winking at you.

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:10.620
 (all laughing)

00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:11.860
 - That's no sparring.

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:14.940
 - But yeah, this was the thing.

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:18.480
 It was women had started to be able to show their knees

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.320
 and they decided, well, we're going to make the most of it.

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.800
 And so they started putting makeup on.

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:24.200
 - So it's poor men were suddenly going around saying,

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:26.640
 did you know women's knees have smiley face on them?

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:28.560
 (all laughing)

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:29.400
 That's amazing.

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:30.240
 - That's great.

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:33.080
 - Only animal with four knees.

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:35.080
 - Dogs, cats, elephants.

00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:35.920
 - Quadrupeds.

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:36.760
 - Any quadruped.

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:39.880
 - No, no, they don't have countless knees on the back.

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:41.640
 No animals have four knees.

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:44.980
 Zero, one animal has four kneecaps.

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:45.900
 - Yeah.

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:47.740
 - And it only has two legs.

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:49.100
 (all laughing)

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:49.940
 - I know the answer.

00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:51.020
 Are we still playing Andy's quiz?

00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:52.500
 'Cause I can get it if yes.

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:55.940
 - This is a horrible riddle in a cave in ancient Greece.

00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:57.260
 It's ridiculous.

00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:58.100
 Sorry.

00:36:58.100 --> 00:36:59.540
 What you're saying is that all animals,

00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:01.580
 all quadrupeds, they have arms and legs rather.

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:02.900
 They may walk around on all fours.

00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:03.740
 - Exactly.

00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:04.980
 - But their skeleton structure is.

00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:06.100
 - They have elbows and knees.

00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:07.180
 They don't have four knees.

00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:08.020
 - Exactly.

00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:08.860
 Sorry, that's.

00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:11.300
 - And there's one bipedal one that has four knees.

00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:12.440
 - We should just let Dan answer.

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:15.340
 - Well, two knees are hidden under a coat of feathers.

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:17.000
 - Oh, they're all hidden.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.080
 - Are we talking about the same animal here?

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:18.920
 - Yeah, we are.

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:19.760
 I think you just haven't looked

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:20.600
 at the diagrams closely enough.

00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:22.400
 (all laughing)

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.240
 - Right, so it's feathered.

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:25.480
 - Okay, if it's two-legged and feathered, an ostrich.

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:26.320
 - Yes!

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:27.920
 James, that's very good, actually.

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:30.520
 - Well, it was either that or an emu or a cassowary.

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:31.800
 - Whose quiz is better?

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:35.040
 Like mine, where it's to get me into a dull anecdote,

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:37.820
 or Anna's, where it's a mental shit show.

00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:39.960
 (all laughing)

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:41.900
 I haven't worked out the format,

00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:44.980
 but I think the kernel of an idea is there.

00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:45.820
 This is really interesting.

00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:47.740
 We only found out recently that ostriches

00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:48.840
 have four kneecaps.

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:52.980
 Everything else has two, and sort of four knees.

00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:54.820
 So if you look at birds like ostriches,

00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:56.500
 the thing that you might think is a knee,

00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:58.980
 if you're an idiot, is actually the ankle, right?

00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:00.620
 Because if you look at those birds--

00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:02.060
 - The knees are up inside.

00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:03.540
 - The knees are up inside the feathers, yeah.

00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:05.140
 - They've got really long feet bones.

00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:05.980
 - Exactly.

00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:07.900
 - It's like how horses, like the lower half of their leg,

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:08.980
 is actually their middle toe.

00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:10.400
 Precisely, all animals like that.

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:13.240
 But up, though, under their feathers,

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:14.640
 they seem to have two sets of knees.

00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:15.720
 We really don't know why.

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:17.680
 Two sets of knees, two sets of kneecaps.

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:20.880
 And who knows why, but cassowaries and emus

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:22.640
 don't have any at the end.

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:23.600
 Dan, back me up on this.

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:24.440
 - It's true.

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:25.280
 - Yeah.

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:27.480
 - It's a great quiz, but the host says back me up, Dan.

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:30.480
 (all laughing)

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:33.060
 (upbeat music)

00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:37.520
 - Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:38.720
 and that is my fact.

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:40.980
 My fact this week is that once married,

00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:44.460
 some Australian Aboriginals spend the rest of their lives

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:47.320
 actively avoiding their mother-in-law.

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:51.220
 - Hey, didn't know I was an Australian Aboriginal, hey.

00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:53.000
 - I actually think my mother-in-law's brilliant.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.740
 (all laughing)

00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:57.020
 - So this is a thing that's called avoidance speech.

00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:59.780
 And a lot of native Australians have this

00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:02.340
 as part of their culture, where once they're married,

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:04.060
 the idea of talking to their in-laws

00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:06.300
 is suddenly something that's seen as taboo,

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:07.300
 and you never do.

00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:10.480
 And there's quite a few examples of modern-day marriages

00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:11.920
 where this is still adhered to.

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:14.640
 So I was reading a blog by a guy who was saying that

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:17.540
 with his parents-in-laws, he can't hand food directly

00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:20.120
 to them either, as well as not talking to them.

00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:22.320
 - It must make the egg game very difficult.

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:24.900
 (all laughing)

00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:28.580
 - You can't look at them directly

00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:30.460
 if he has something that he needs to ask them.

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:32.680
 He needs to ask them through the wife.

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:34.680
 So she goes and gets their permission

00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:36.800
 or finds out something for them.

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:39.580
 And it's seen as something that's a marker of respect

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:40.820
 in these families.

00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:42.580
 And the same person who was writing this blog,

00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:44.740
 who did that with his wife, now has that

00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:47.740
 with his relationship with his daughter's husband.

00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:49.580
 And then your language gets changed as well.

00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:51.480
 So they won't say the name.

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:52.900
 They'll say my mother-in-law and father-in-law.

00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:54.580
 They won't use their actual name.

00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:56.980
 And if they're in a room with them and they're watching TV,

00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:58.260
 let's say the son-in-laws in the room,

00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:00.220
 he'll face the wall away.

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:02.220
 So he's not acknowledging them.

00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:03.380
 Why are they watching TV?

00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:06.180
 That's a very anti-social thing to do.

00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:07.040
 So annoying.

00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:08.520
 What's happening now?

00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:10.000
 And what's happening now?

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:10.840
 - No, no, no, please.

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:13.240
 My wife just told me what's happening now, not you.

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:14.880
 Why do these taboos exist?

00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:16.720
 That's what I'm really baffled by.

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:18.960
 - Well, they are around the world, aren't they?

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:20.040
 - It's extraordinary.

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:22.400
 Native America, across Africa, Australian originals,

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:24.560
 what, and I haven't read an explanation.

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:25.400
 - I did read them.

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:26.240
 - Which satisfies me.

00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:28.480
 - It's potentially a respect thing.

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:32.120
 It might be a way of preventing any hanky-panky.

00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:32.960
 - I think it's not.

00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:34.360
 I think it's gotta be shagging.

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:35.680
 - There was a big article I read

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:38.420
 called "The Mother-in-Law Taboo" by A.E.M.J. Pans,

00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:41.460
 which is one of the main papers on this subject.

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:44.380
 And he reckons that basically it's to indicate publicly

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:46.060
 that the son-in-law and the mother-in-law

00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:47.860
 are not having sex with each other.

00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:49.300
 - But it makes me think they are.

00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:50.460
 That's the weird thing.

00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:51.620
 It's always in the office.

00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:53.740
 It's always the two people who are completely pretending

00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:54.660
 they don't know each other exist

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:56.420
 who turn out to have been having a torrid affair.

00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:57.260
 - Is it?

00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:58.100
 - It's exactly what I thought.

00:40:58.100 --> 00:40:59.100
 And also it will make you fancy them.

00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:00.740
 The more you're told you're not allowed to speak

00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:02.300
 with someone or stick your tongue down their throat,

00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:03.740
 the more you want it, don't you?

00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:04.740
 - A bit of fruit.

00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:05.900
 - Yes.

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:08.020
 Also, why was that bad?

00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:10.700
 - Why is it bad to have it with your father-in-law?

00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:11.540
 Why is it bad?

00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:13.420
 - So the reason is that it happens more

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:16.060
 in matrilineal cultures.

00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:19.260
 So, and it's like this taboo, it does happen.

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:20.500
 And that's true.

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:22.060
 And it tends to be that the women

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:24.700
 have very particular roles that they have.

00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:26.900
 And the idea is that your mother-in-law

00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:28.860
 is not taking over the job

00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:30.660
 of what your wife is supposed to do.

00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:31.500
 - I see.

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:32.380
 - So there might be lots of different things

00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:34.140
 that a wife is supposed to do in this culture,

00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:36.660
 one of which is sleeping with the husband,

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:37.500
 but they're trying to show

00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:38.860
 that this definitely isn't happening

00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:40.740
 and that the generation has moved on

00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:41.860
 to the next generation.

00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:42.820
 That's the idea.

00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:44.060
 - And I suppose that's the woman,

00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:45.740
 other woman that you would see most often.

00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:47.140
 So if you were going to shag anyone else,

00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:49.080
 it would probably be your wife's mum.

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:50.900
 And I think sometimes mother-in-law taboos

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:53.060
 also apply to like your mother-in-law's mate.

00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:55.780
 Sometimes mother-in-law can be a bit of a broader term.

00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:57.860
 So it can be a few women who are also really close to you.

00:41:57.860 --> 00:41:59.820
 - Yeah, we should say these taboos,

00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:02.500
 they vary a lot between different groups.

00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:07.100
 So in some cases, it's completely avoiding them physically.

00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:08.940
 In some, it's using a particular,

00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:10.820
 like a different language to address them.

00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:12.740
 And in some, it's using a subset of language.

00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:15.480
 So there's a group called Deer Bell is a language.

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:17.420
 And the main language is called Gouel.

00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:21.060
 And the language for your mother-in-law is Dianghi.

00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:22.620
 I'm trying to pronounce it wrong.

00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:25.940
 But it's like, it's missing particular words

00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:28.100
 that might be erotic flash points.

00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:31.140
 - Sorry, like what?

00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:33.580
 - Oh loads, erotic flash points.

00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:34.420
 - Like ankle.

00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:35.780
 - I mean, there are loads, are there?

00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:38.180
 Pubic hair, sweaty smell, you know.

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:39.020
 You don't want to mention that

00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:40.740
 in case things just pop off suddenly.

00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:41.860
 So yeah, yeah.

00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:43.500
 - So you're saying you don't say that those words

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:44.860
 in front of your mother-in-law either?

00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:46.060
 - I'd have to have a really good reason

00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:48.060
 to talk about pubic hair in front of my mother-in-law.

00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:49.420
 - Exactly, I think anyone would.

00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:51.460
 - But that's the thing, it's not mad taboo

00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:52.820
 against sleeping with your mother-in-law.

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:54.100
 - I read one thing.

00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:57.820
 This is by a US historian called Hampton Sides.

00:42:57.820 --> 00:42:59.620
 And that the reason I'm saying it's by him

00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:00.700
 is 'cause I don't believe it.

00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:03.820
 But he wrote that in the Navajo people,

00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:06.180
 husbands are not allowed to look at their mother-in-laws

00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:08.700
 and it's so important

00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:11.620
 that the mother-in-laws would wear little bells

00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:14.540
 on their clothes so that he could hear them coming.

00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:15.380
 - I think that's true.

00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:17.060
 - I just can't believe it's true.

00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:18.660
 But it was, he's a proper historian.

00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:19.500
 - I think that's true.

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:21.340
 - Like he's a bird and they're the cat.

00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:22.900
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:24.460
 - I think there was a first-hand account.

00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:26.700
 And it's similar to the Kaurawai people in West Papua

00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:28.500
 who shout when they're going round corners

00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:29.460
 for exactly the same reason.

00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:31.180
 The mother-in-law, son-in-law taboo,

00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:33.780
 they'll shout to make clear if a son-in-law's there,

00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:36.300
 go away, and also if the son-in-law's friends

00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:38.380
 see the mum coming, they'll run and find the son

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:39.580
 and say, "She's coming, she's coming."

00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:40.420
 - That's interesting.

00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:41.900
 That's like working in a restaurant.

00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:44.260
 Whenever you go round the corner, you go corner.

00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:45.100
 - Oh, nice.

00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:46.220
 - So that people coming in the other direction

00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:47.780
 don't hit you and you drop all the food.

00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:49.220
 - Is that when you're going in and out of the kitchen

00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:50.060
 is where you shout something like that?

00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:52.820
 - Yeah, at any time, when you're going in a blind corner.

00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:54.380
 - Well, and like, did your grandparents

00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:55.300
 always used to honk the horn

00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:56.660
 going around any corner driving?

00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:57.700
 (laughing)

00:43:57.700 --> 00:43:58.540
 - No.

00:43:58.540 --> 00:43:59.360
 - Didn't they?

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:00.200
 It's so embarrassing.

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:01.660
 - Oh my God, that time we went to that labyrinth,

00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:02.500
 it was a nightmare.

00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:03.460
 (laughing)

00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:05.420
 - I used to hate it so much.

00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:07.140
 Every corner, gamma honked her horn.

00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:08.860
 It was just awful.

00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:11.140
 Yeah, it was so motivating.

00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:12.260
 - That's so funny.

00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:14.580
 - Sometimes I think you have to concentrate really hard

00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:16.300
 to keep these taboos going.

00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:21.300
 So there's one in a similar mother-in-law, son-in-law taboo

00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:24.300
 in southwestern Ethiopia.

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:27.180
 And it's a practice called Balisha.

00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:30.820
 And it's basically that married women

00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:34.120
 can't speak the name of their husband's mother or father,

00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:36.780
 but they also can't speak any word

00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:38.260
 beginning with the same syllable

00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:40.380
 of their husband or father's name.

00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:41.220
 So--

00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:42.260
 - So if my mother-in-law was called Pat,

00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:45.340
 I couldn't say, what's the word we can use, Pat?

00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:46.180
 - Pat the dog?

00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:48.940
 - Yeah, right, I'd have to say, can you stroke the dog?

00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:52.100
 - What was the name of that World War II general from America?

00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:54.820
 (laughing)

00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:56.380
 - Eisenhower.

00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:57.860
 - What's the name of that postman?

00:44:57.860 --> 00:45:00.260
 (laughing)

00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:01.100
 - That's interesting.

00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:03.140
 - You'd have to concentrate so much.

00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:06.420
 - But apparently in those cultures where that's the case,

00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:08.180
 you're taught another language

00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:10.100
 so that if you were in that situation,

00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:12.300
 not only will you be able to know what to do,

00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:14.740
 but you will say words everyone else will know as well.

00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:16.420
 - And some of them, you do have another language, yeah.

00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:17.460
 And then some, they're just like,

00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:19.140
 come up with another word, say stroke,

00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:20.300
 which isn't the same as passing.

00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:21.140
 So, you know.

00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:22.340
 - Horseman stroke.

00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:24.380
 (laughing)

00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:25.860
 - Incest taboos.

00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:26.700
 - Oh, yeah.

00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:29.620
 - From around the world, including Anglo-Saxon,

00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:32.260
 I wanted to see if it existed in this country.

00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:34.780
 And according to the penitential of Theodore,

00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:36.700
 which is from the seventh century,

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:39.620
 if a brother commits fornication with his brother,

00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:42.300
 he has to do penance for 15 years.

00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:45.700
 So that's 15 years without eating meat or drinking wine

00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:47.500
 if you have sex with your brother.

00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:48.340
 - Okay.

00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:49.180
 - Climby.

00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:50.020
 - That's a lot, I don't know.

00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:50.860
 - That's a lot, that's a lot.

00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:52.660
 - It's not worth it, it's not worth it, would you say?

00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:54.260
 (laughing)

00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:55.300
 - Well, there was a thing in Old England,

00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:59.060
 the swesterosunu, which is where that's your sister's son.

00:45:59.060 --> 00:45:59.900
 Right?

00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:01.100
 - So it's a nephew.

00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:02.060
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:04.700
 But it's specifically with your sister's son

00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:06.860
 because your sister's son, your nephew,

00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:09.540
 is definitely related to you by blood.

00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:11.420
 Because you and your sister have both come

00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:12.260
 from the same mother,

00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:13.940
 so you are definitely related by blood

00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:15.540
 and she has given birth to her son.

00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:18.220
 - Yeah, so even if there was hanky-panky going on

00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:20.460
 in any of these situations, it's still related.

00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:21.300
 - Right.

00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:22.780
 - Like, if my wife has cheated on me,

00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:24.340
 my son might not be my own,

00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:27.380
 but my sister's son is definitely related to me by blood.

00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:29.940
 So that is a sort of rock solid relationship to form.

00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:31.540
 - Yeah, that should be where inheritance goes.

00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:34.460
 I'm surprised that's not where inheritance works more often.

00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:35.300
 - To the sisters.

00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:37.140
 - Yeah, 'cause it's the one you can trust, as you say.

00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:37.980
 - Yeah, yeah, you can't trust anyone.

00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:39.220
 - We should change the rules.

00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:41.060
 (laughing)

00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:42.260
 - Mothers in law?

00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:43.340
 - Yeah.

00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:45.500
 - I just found some famous mothers in law.

00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:46.340
 - Okay.

00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:47.180
 - Would you remember last time we talked about

00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:48.180
 L. Frank Baum's mother-in-law?

00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:49.020
 - We did.

00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:50.420
 - Until the Gage.

00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:52.580
 So I thought I'd try and find any more notable

00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:53.420
 mothers-in-law.

00:46:53.420 --> 00:46:54.260
 - Yeah.

00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:57.860
 - The mother-in-law of the Marquis de Sade

00:46:57.860 --> 00:46:59.780
 was really annoyed with him.

00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:00.620
 - Oh, is she?

00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:01.460
 - Yeah.

00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:02.300
 - Well, a lot of people were.

00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:05.140
 - Yeah, he ran off to Italy with his wife's younger sister.

00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:06.580
 - Yeah.

00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:08.260
 - So she was furious about that.

00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:10.020
 Also, she's still her mother-in-law.

00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:11.340
 She's the same mother-in-law even with him.

00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:12.980
 - You don't need to explain that.

00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:13.820
 I think that's--

00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:14.660
 - I think you do.

00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:15.580
 Why don't you be flattered?

00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:17.540
 It's like, don't fancy one of my daughters.

00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:18.860
 You fancy both of them.

00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:19.700
 - Yeah.

00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:20.740
 Well, she got him arrested.

00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:22.700
 She helped the authorities hunt him down.

00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:23.900
 And he spent most of the rest of his life

00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:25.180
 in prison or in asylum.

00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:27.260
 But he had also been committing horrible crimes.

00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:28.420
 - Yeah.

00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:31.060
 Jumping back to the L. Frant Baum very quickly,

00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:34.300
 the Tin Man in the movie, he had a son.

00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:36.740
 Do you know who his mother-in-law was?

00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:37.580
 - The Tin Man's wife.

00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:40.940
 - So the actor who plays the Tin Man has a son.

00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:42.580
 Who's his mother-in-law in real life?

00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:44.300
 - Well, will it be his wife?

00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:45.140
 - His wife's mom.

00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:48.780
 - So he got married to someone who had a notable mother.

00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:49.620
 Who became his mother-in-law.

00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:51.660
 - Dan's quiz feels like the least good of all.

00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:52.700
 This is not guessable.

00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:53.900
 - It's got the best reveal.

00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:55.780
 It was Judy Garland.

00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:59.660
 Because Dorothy had a daughter, Liza Minnelli.

00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:02.180
 Liza Minnelli married the Tin Man's son.

00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:03.620
 - Did not know that that's cool.

00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:04.460
 - Yeah.

00:48:04.460 --> 00:48:05.300
 - That is cool.

00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:06.140
 - There you go.

00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:07.620
 - That is quite a good quiz where the questions

00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:09.940
 are completely stupid all over the place.

00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:11.820
 But the answers are absolutely amazing.

00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:13.060
 Isn't that what QI is?

00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:15.300
 (laughing)

00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:17.880
 (upbeat music)

00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:20.720
 (upbeat music)

00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:22.160
 - Okay, that's it.

00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:25.160
 That's all of our sexy romantic facts.

00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:26.200
