00:00:06,00:00:08,It is our Valentine's Day special.
00:00:08,00:00:11,"So yeah, we've collected together some of the sexiest,"
00:00:11,00:00:13,most romantic facts that we could possibly find
00:00:13,00:00:15,for your listening pleasure.
00:00:15,00:00:16,And we'll be getting to that
00:00:16,00:00:17,over the course of this episode.
00:00:17,00:00:19,"However, before we get into that,"
00:00:19,00:00:20,"I've just got a quick announcement,"
00:00:20,00:00:23,which is that we have a live show coming up
00:00:23,00:00:27,in July at the Crossed Wires Festival podcast in Sheffield.
00:00:27,00:00:31,So the Crossed Wires podcast festival is fantastic.
00:00:31,00:00:32,It debuted last year.
00:00:32,00:00:35,"It was co-created by our good buddy, Alice Levine,"
00:00:35,00:00:36,"from My Dad Wrote a Porno,"
00:00:36,00:00:38,and they are back this year for round two.
00:00:38,00:00:42,"And really excitingly, she has invited us to be part of it."
00:00:42,00:00:44,So we will be there to record a live episode
00:00:44,00:00:47,at the City Hall on the 6th of July at 2PM.

00:01:07,00:01:09,So many great shows are gonna be there this year.
00:01:09,00:01:11,It's so awesome that these podcast festivals
00:01:11,00:01:13,are erupting around the UK.
00:01:13,00:01:15,Do support them and do come see us.
00:01:15,00:01:16,We'd love to see you there.
00:01:16,00:01:18,"All right, well, let's get into this week's episode."
00:01:18,00:01:20,It is our Valentine's Day special.
00:01:20,00:01:24,"Enjoy our sexy, sexy facts on with the show."
00:01:25,00:01:27,(upbeat music)
00:01:27,00:01:39,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:01:39,00:01:40,"of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:01:40,00:01:42,a weekly podcast coming to you
00:01:42,00:01:44,from the QI offices in Hoburn.
00:01:44,00:01:46,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:01:46,00:01:48,"I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Anna Tyshinski"
00:01:48,00:01:50,and Andrew Hunter Murray.
00:01:50,00:01:52,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:01:52,00:01:55,with our four favorite Valentine's Day facts.
00:01:55,00:01:58,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:01:58,00:02:01,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy."
00:02:01,00:02:04,"- My fact is, before flirting with females,"
00:02:04,00:02:07,young male dolphins practice on their male friends.
00:02:07,00:02:09,"- Happy Valentine's Day, everyone."
00:02:09,00:02:12,"- Yeah, this is an erotic special."
00:02:12,00:02:15,"- Roses are red, this fact is very blue."
00:02:15,00:02:16,"- It is quite blue, actually."
00:02:16,00:02:17,"- Well, what do they practice?"
00:02:17,00:02:18,How blue is it?
00:02:18,00:02:18,"- Well, that's--"
00:02:18,00:02:19,- 'Cause dolphins are blue?
00:02:19,00:02:20,"- Yeah, they're rude."
00:02:20,00:02:21,- Are they?
00:02:21,00:02:23,"- Well, they're sort of blueish, aren't they, in cartoons?"
00:02:23,00:02:25,"- Yeah, they're gray, gray blue."
00:02:25,00:02:26,- They're gray.
00:02:26,00:02:26,- Bluey gray.
00:02:26,00:02:28,This is a place that actually is a friend of the podcast.
00:02:28,00:02:29,"It's Shark Bay in Australia,"
00:02:29,00:02:31,where some research was done.
00:02:31,00:02:33,We said it was renamed Safety Beach.
00:02:33,00:02:34,"- Yeah, we did."
00:02:34,00:02:36,"- Yeah, I think that was fake."
00:02:36,00:02:38,I think that's a retraction we need to make.
00:02:38,00:02:39,"- Oh, great, okay."
00:02:39,00:02:40,- Are we all making that as a group?
00:02:40,00:02:42,"- No, just me, leave it to me."
00:02:42,00:02:44,"You guys, you guys stay unblemished."
00:02:44,00:02:46,So there's a group of dolphins who've been living there
00:02:46,00:02:48,and they've been studying for about 40 years.
00:02:48,00:02:49,"They're really, really well,"
00:02:49,00:02:50,the best-studied group of dolphins in the world.
00:02:50,00:02:52,They have very complicated social relationships
00:02:52,00:02:53,with each other.
00:02:53,00:02:56,Scientists find it very useful to kind of keep tabs on them.
00:02:56,00:03:00,"And these young males, they pall up in groups of two or three"
00:03:00,00:03:01,and they coordinate their behavior
00:03:01,00:03:05,to consort particular females.
00:03:05,00:03:08,"And that, this is where it gets a bit,"
00:03:08,00:03:09,flirting is a very nice way of describing it
00:03:09,00:03:11,'cause male dolphins sort of coerce
00:03:11,00:03:13,and harass individual females
00:03:13,00:03:15,and try and separate them from whichever males
00:03:15,00:03:17,they're hanging out with.
00:03:17,00:03:19,But then they do some displays of acrobatics
00:03:19,00:03:20,and somersaults.
00:03:20,00:03:23,It sounds like a sort of sea world thing.
00:03:23,00:03:23,- Uh-huh.
00:03:23,00:03:25,"- You know, they do tricks."
00:03:25,00:03:27,They do also bite her sometimes.
00:03:27,00:03:31,"Anyway, they are really getting some mixed signals here."
00:03:31,00:03:34,I don't want to get all rubbing thickie on your ass.
00:03:34,00:03:36,"- Look at the somersaults, look at the somersaults."
00:03:36,00:03:38,(laughing)
00:03:38,00:03:41,"- Yeah, so, but they do practice with each other."
00:03:41,00:03:42,And the ones who practice with each other
00:03:42,00:03:44,have better success later in life.
00:03:44,00:03:46,"Romantically, you know, they farther more offspring"
00:03:46,00:03:47,than the ones that don't.
00:03:47,00:03:50,- Do they ever fall in love with each other accidentally?
00:03:50,00:03:51,- Oh my God.
00:03:51,00:03:52,- Good question.
00:03:52,00:03:53,- Flipper three.
00:03:53,00:03:55,- Reminds me a bit of a Friends episode
00:03:55,00:03:59,where Joey helps trigger the janitor to dance.
00:03:59,00:04:01,He's his dance partner and he sort of starts
00:04:01,00:04:03,to wish that he was his real dance partner.
00:04:03,00:04:04,I wonder if there are dolphins out there
00:04:04,00:04:06,"who just are like, let's have one more practice."
00:04:06,00:04:07,- I think so.
00:04:07,00:04:09,"I mean, there's lots of, there are occasionally,"
00:04:09,00:04:11,"I find a lot of headlines in the mail,"
00:04:11,00:04:12,"the Daily Mail saying things like,"
00:04:12,00:04:14,more gay dolphins spotted off Canada
00:04:14,00:04:17,like it's very bright and concerned for them.
00:04:17,00:04:18,- Yeah.
00:04:18,00:04:19,"- Yeah, they can't, they can't be quite aggro,"
00:04:19,00:04:20,can't they?
00:04:20,00:04:21,- Oh yeah.
00:04:21,00:04:22,- The dolphins.
00:04:22,00:04:24,"And like, but it is sort of their male bonds"
00:04:24,00:04:26,are sort of nice.
00:04:26,00:04:28,"It does seem like this study, I think,"
00:04:28,00:04:31,was the first to reveal that they have a buddy system
00:04:31,00:04:33,and they'll pick a best friend.
00:04:33,00:04:34,"Some of the males, not all of the males,"
00:04:34,00:04:35,they'll pick a best friend.
00:04:35,00:04:37,And that'll be someone that they hang out with
00:04:37,00:04:38,for their whole life.
00:04:38,00:04:40,And sometimes you'll have the two male buddies
00:04:40,00:04:41,who hang out together.
00:04:41,00:04:44,"And if they're separated for up to decades,"
00:04:44,00:04:46,"I think it is when they come back together,"
00:04:46,00:04:47,they're their best friends still.
00:04:47,00:04:49,"- Once there's quite a few ways that dolphins can mate,"
00:04:49,00:04:51,there's a sort of T-section shape that they do.
00:04:51,00:04:54,So the male dolphin goes sort of horizontal
00:04:54,00:04:56,against the vertical of the female dolphin
00:04:56,00:04:58,in order to have sex.
00:04:58,00:04:58,There's a few other methods.
00:04:58,00:05:01,One method that gets described for one of the dolphins
00:05:01,00:05:05,"is having this buddy, the wingman come,"
00:05:05,00:05:08,and at surface level sort of hold for buoyancy reasons.
00:05:08,00:05:10,So they're sort of there just to prop him up
00:05:10,00:05:12,to make sure the sex can happen.
00:05:12,00:05:14,Which a lot of NASA scientists are saying
00:05:14,00:05:16,that might be the best way that humans will have sex.
00:05:16,00:05:19,- We're not taking dolphins up to Mars.
00:05:19,00:05:21,"- We're not taking dolphins, we're just screwing like them."
00:05:21,00:05:24,"If sex is happening, there needs to be a third astronaut"
00:05:24,00:05:26,to come in and just hold everything together.
00:05:26,00:05:28,"- Dave, Dave, sex is happening."
00:05:28,00:05:29,Come on in.
00:05:29,00:05:31,(all laughing)
00:05:31,00:05:32,- Surely not.
00:05:32,00:05:33,- But there was a recent report by someone
00:05:33,00:05:34,who's trying to work on the problem
00:05:34,00:05:36,of population and space. - By a space pervert.
00:05:36,00:05:38,(all laughing)
00:05:38,00:05:40,- I think dolphins are perverts really.
00:05:40,00:05:41,I think by any means.
00:05:41,00:05:45,"- Well, they have sex often with their mothers, male dolphins."
00:05:45,00:05:46,- No.
00:05:46,00:05:49,"- Yeah, bottom-nosed dolphins like to gather"
00:05:49,00:05:51,around gray whales when they're mating.
00:05:51,00:05:53,"No one really knows why,"
00:05:53,00:05:55,but they just enjoy watching.
00:05:55,00:05:55,- Right.
00:05:55,00:05:57,- You can't get porn underwater.
00:05:57,00:06:00,"- So their mom's nipples are up their butt,"
00:06:00,00:06:02,"so when they breastfeed-- - It is, it is."
00:06:02,00:06:06,"So when they breastfeed, they literally burrow their--"
00:06:06,00:06:07,- That can't be true.
00:06:07,00:06:08,- Dolphin noses into the anus of their mom.
00:06:08,00:06:09,"- No, that can't be true."
00:06:09,00:06:11,- It's true.
00:06:11,00:06:11,- Is it really?
00:06:11,00:06:13,- I didn't just come up with that.
00:06:13,00:06:14,(all laughing)
00:06:14,00:06:17,"I mean, it's possible I did just come up with that, but."
00:06:17,00:06:18,"- Okay, can we bust one myth?"
00:06:18,00:06:19,"- Yeah, sure."
00:06:19,00:06:21,"- This is exciting stuff not to blow wide open,"
00:06:21,00:06:22,but to close down.
00:06:22,00:06:24,And it's a thing we have propagated actually in the past.
00:06:24,00:06:25,"So, you know, it's like the rest for us."
00:06:25,00:06:29,"It's the blowhole, the blowhole sex myth."
00:06:29,00:06:32,- What's the myth that they have sex with their blowholes?
00:06:32,00:06:33,- Yeah.
00:06:33,00:06:34,- And we've claimed that.
00:06:34,00:06:34,- I think so.
00:06:34,00:06:35,- Have we?
00:06:35,00:06:36,- We're perverts. - A long time ago.
00:06:36,00:06:38,"Like nine years ago, I think, you know,"
00:06:38,00:06:39,we're different people now.
00:06:39,00:06:40,- What's the truth then?
00:06:40,00:06:42,"- I think, well, there's one mention of it"
00:06:42,00:06:44,in a paper in 1994.
00:06:44,00:06:46,"- Oh, you shagged one blowhole."
00:06:46,00:06:48,(all laughing)
00:06:48,00:06:51,"And the researcher, a researcher called Justin Gregg"
00:06:51,00:06:55,spoke to the person who had authored that 1994 article
00:06:55,00:06:57,"who said, and I'm quoting here,"
00:06:57,00:06:58,"""With regard to the blowhole,"
00:06:58,00:07:00,"they never inserted the penis entirely."""
00:07:00,00:07:03,I don't know whether that stands up in court
00:07:03,00:07:05,and the I'm gonna say.
00:07:05,00:07:07,- What percentage of the penis?
00:07:07,00:07:09,"Oh, only 25, that's fine."
00:07:09,00:07:10,- But they breathe through it.
00:07:10,00:07:12,"Turns out they can breathe through their mouth as well,"
00:07:12,00:07:14,which we didn't know until 2016.
00:07:14,00:07:16,It's assumed that they can't breathe
00:07:16,00:07:17,because we've never seen them breathing through their mouth.
00:07:17,00:07:20,But they found one dolphin with a damaged blowhole.
00:07:20,00:07:21,Blowhole.
00:07:21,00:07:24,(all laughing)
00:07:24,00:07:25,One of a...
00:07:25,00:07:27,Are you being serious?
00:07:27,00:07:28,You have a damaged blowhole.
00:07:28,00:07:31,(all laughing)
00:07:31,00:07:32,- No word.
00:07:32,00:07:33,Or what?
00:07:33,00:07:34,The damage.
00:07:34,00:07:37,But they found that it was breathing through its mouth
00:07:37,00:07:38,as a result.
00:07:38,00:07:40,So possibly even dolphins don't know
00:07:40,00:07:42,they can breathe through their mouth.
00:07:42,00:07:42,- Wow.
00:07:42,00:07:43,- Yeah.
00:07:43,00:07:44,- We call them clever.
00:07:44,00:07:45,(all laughing)
00:07:45,00:07:49,- I feel like everything I've said is a lie so far.
00:07:49,00:07:50,"- Where did you get all this stuff from, Dan?"
00:07:50,00:07:52,- It's just stuff I know.
00:07:52,00:07:54,(all laughing)
00:07:54,00:07:55,We've talked a lot in the past
00:07:55,00:07:57,about dolphins having military connections.
00:07:57,00:08:00,They've worked with the military a lot.
00:08:00,00:08:01,I didn't know this.
00:08:01,00:08:05,There's like the biggest horde of nuclear weapons
00:08:05,00:08:08,is in a submarine base in America
00:08:08,00:08:11,and it's protected by military dolphins.
00:08:11,00:08:13,So anyone trying to get access to it
00:08:13,00:08:14,has to face a dolphin.
00:08:14,00:08:15,Isn't that amazing?
00:08:15,00:08:16,And what happens is...
00:08:16,00:08:17,- Sometimes I think you have your own
00:08:17,00:08:19,different Google and their experts.
00:08:19,00:08:20,(all laughing)
00:08:20,00:08:22,"- Well, the interesting thing is if they..."
00:08:22,00:08:24,So they can't...
00:08:24,00:08:27,It's very hard to monitor an underwater base
00:08:27,00:08:28,with nuclear weapons.
00:08:28,00:08:31,So they need an animal that can just be there
00:08:31,00:08:32,all the time to do it.
00:08:32,00:08:33,- Where is this?
00:08:33,00:08:34,"Sorry, where..."
00:08:34,00:08:34,- It's near Boston.
00:08:34,00:08:35,- U.S.
00:08:35,00:08:37,"- Yeah, you can't give away the exact location,"
00:08:37,00:08:38,"I'm sure, Dan."
00:08:38,00:08:39,"- Yeah, sorry, Seattle."
00:08:39,00:08:40,It's 20 miles.
00:08:40,00:08:41,"- Oh, it's Seattle."
00:08:41,00:08:41,(all laughing)
00:08:41,00:08:43,"- 5,000 miles from Boston."
00:08:43,00:08:45,(all laughing)
00:08:45,00:08:47,- It's the world's largest single location
00:08:47,00:08:48,of our smell of nuclear weapons.
00:08:48,00:08:49,"- Wow, it's underwater."
00:08:49,00:08:50,- Certainly at the time of writing.
00:08:50,00:08:51,"It's underwater, right?"
00:08:51,00:08:53,And so they have these military dolphins
00:08:53,00:08:54,and they have this amazing thing
00:08:54,00:08:55,where if someone's swimming
00:08:55,00:08:57,to try and get access to this submarine base
00:08:57,00:09:01,"to steal a nuke of one man just swimming to get to it,"
00:09:01,00:09:03,the dolphins have a metal plate in their mouth
00:09:03,00:09:06,"that when they go up and rub up against the swimmer,"
00:09:06,00:09:08,"they can attach like a handcuff,"
00:09:08,00:09:11,like a subtle handcuff going to your leg.
00:09:11,00:09:11,- What are you talking about?
00:09:11,00:09:13,"- Honestly, this is what happens."
00:09:13,00:09:15,It goes around the leg or the arm of the person
00:09:15,00:09:18,"and then it deploys a boy and floats them,"
00:09:18,00:09:19,"like just goes whoop,"
00:09:19,00:09:21,and they just disappear up to the surface.
00:09:21,00:09:23,- Were they arrested by a police dolphin at the top?
00:09:23,00:09:24,(all laughing)
00:09:24,00:09:25,"- The dolphins are purely underwater based,"
00:09:25,00:09:27,so that becomes a human problem
00:09:27,00:09:28,when they arrive at the top.
00:09:28,00:09:30,"- Right, that's either extraordinary"
00:09:30,00:09:32,or what are you talking about?
00:09:32,00:09:34,"- No, that's incredible, unbelievable."
00:09:34,00:09:36,"- This was in 2010, so it's possible the dolphins were fine."
00:09:36,00:09:39,"- Oh yeah, yeah, they're moving on to par places now."
00:09:39,00:09:40,"- Well, they get seals as well,"
00:09:40,00:09:43,"Navy seals, but like actual seals."
00:09:43,00:09:46,"- Oh yeah, I feel like we have actually mentioned that before."
00:09:46,00:09:47,We can't just laugh at everything Dan said.
00:09:47,00:09:50,"- No, from now on though. - Some of it is true."
00:09:50,00:09:52,"- You gotta start with something more believable, Dan,"
00:09:52,00:09:53,and then build up to this.
00:09:53,00:09:56,"- Well, we know that they do this kind of stuff."
00:09:56,00:09:58,"- It's only Cold War superpowers, isn't it?"
00:09:58,00:10:00,It's only America and Russia that--
00:10:00,00:10:02,"- That we know of. - That we know of,"
00:10:02,00:10:03,that have trained dolphins.
00:10:03,00:10:05,- I thought Israel did.
00:10:05,00:10:06,"- Oh yeah, they did, they did."
00:10:06,00:10:07,I'm sure other military powers
00:10:07,00:10:08,have experimented with all that stuff.
00:10:08,00:10:09,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:10:09,00:10:11,"- You know, paw poises that you mentioned."
00:10:11,00:10:13,"You know, they're the reason that we call tortoises,"
00:10:13,00:10:15,tortoises. - No.
00:10:15,00:10:17,"- Which I don't think we've mentioned before,"
00:10:17,00:10:20,"but because paw poise,"
00:10:20,00:10:22,which is basically a dolphin-- - I'm highly pregnant here.
00:10:22,00:10:23,It's a whole show.
00:10:23,00:10:25,"- It does feel a bit like it, doesn't it?"
00:10:25,00:10:27,"- No, this is absolutely correct."
00:10:27,00:10:30,"Paw poise, etymologically, it means pigfish,"
00:10:30,00:10:32,"so the paw is like, has the same root as pork"
00:10:32,00:10:35,"and poise is like, poise on poise, fish."
00:10:35,00:10:37,Tortoises were always tortoise.
00:10:37,00:10:38,"They ended just in US,"
00:10:38,00:10:41,probably coming from a word meaning twisted.
00:10:41,00:10:44,"But once we started having paw poises,"
00:10:44,00:10:47,"people went, well, since we spell that like that,"
00:10:47,00:10:49,should we make it tortoises as well?
00:10:49,00:10:50,'Cause it sounds similar.
00:10:50,00:10:51,And we think that's the only theory we have
00:10:51,00:10:53,"for why suddenly, about 500 years ago,"
00:10:53,00:10:55,we started spelling tortoise like tortoise.
00:10:55,00:10:56,- Someone was writing a poem and they're just like--
00:10:56,00:10:58,(laughing)
00:10:58,00:11:00,- I got nothing after tortoise.
00:11:00,00:11:02,"- That was the main economic activity 500 years ago,"
00:11:02,00:11:04,"was the sonnet, unfortunately."
00:11:04,00:11:06,"And so, it was really important."
00:11:06,00:11:09,- Can we talk about dolphin vaginas?
00:11:09,00:11:11,- Of course. - Quickly.
00:11:11,00:11:12,"They have clitorises,"
00:11:12,00:11:14,and the clitorises are so accessible
00:11:14,00:11:15,when they're having sex
00:11:15,00:11:17,that we think they're probably used for pleasure.
00:11:17,00:11:18,- Okay.
00:11:18,00:11:21,"- But the vagina is really,"
00:11:21,00:11:22,"it's like, unlike most mammals"
00:11:22,00:11:24,"where it's really just like a straight tube,"
00:11:24,00:11:26,with them it goes in all sorts of different directions
00:11:26,00:11:27,and stuff like that.
00:11:27,00:11:31,And you can tell what species a dolphin is
00:11:31,00:11:32,by looking at its vagina.
00:11:32,00:11:33,"- It's like a labyrinth,"
00:11:33,00:11:35,so they can decide whether or not
00:11:35,00:11:38,they want to be impregnated.
00:11:38,00:11:40,"- Sorry, do you mean it's like a maze?"
00:11:40,00:11:43,"'Cause of course, a labyrinth only has one root, doesn't it?"
00:11:43,00:11:44,So that wouldn't fool anyone.
00:11:44,00:11:46,- Labyrinth is like a spiral.
00:11:46,00:11:49,- There's no dead ends in a labyrinth.
00:11:49,00:11:51,"- Yes, no, it's a maze, not a labyrinth, sorry."
00:11:51,00:11:52,- 'Cause we'd get a lot of emails
00:11:52,00:11:55,"if we left it like that. - You're right, you're right."
00:11:55,00:11:57,- Can I just very quickly mention
00:11:57,00:11:59,the basketball player who had a great altercation
00:11:59,00:12:00,"with the dolphin, Clifford Ray."
00:12:00,00:12:02,"- Oh, okay, yeah. - Can I still about him?"
00:12:02,00:12:06,He became super famous for this in 1978 for a short while.
00:12:06,00:12:08,There was a dolphin called Mr. Spock.
00:12:08,00:12:09,They realized that there was a bolt
00:12:09,00:12:12,and a really sharp screw stuck in its stomach
00:12:12,00:12:14,"and second stomach down, so quite far in."
00:12:14,00:12:16,"The vet says, ""I can't operate to remove it."
00:12:16,00:12:19,"""My arm won't reach down its throat enough."""
00:12:19,00:12:21,"And then they were like, ""Who's got really long arms?"
00:12:21,00:12:23,"""This basketball player, Clifford Ray,"
00:12:23,00:12:27,"""famously has arms of three foot nine inches long,"
00:12:27,00:12:28,"""which is long."""
00:12:28,00:12:29,So they got in touch with Clifford
00:12:29,00:12:32,"and he was at a premier in, for some reason,"
00:12:32,00:12:34,"and he was taking a premier in,"
00:12:34,00:12:37,"waiting to go to a, you know, to a game."
00:12:37,00:12:42,"And he rocked up and he was guided by speakerphone,"
00:12:42,00:12:44,by an expert in retrieving stuff
00:12:44,00:12:45,"from the insides of dolphins,"
00:12:45,00:12:48,while he inserted his three foot nine inch long arm
00:12:48,00:12:49,"into the dolphin. - And he's like,"
00:12:49,00:12:52,it's like a labyrinth in here.
00:12:52,00:12:53,"- The other end, the other end."
00:12:53,00:12:56,(all laughing)
00:12:56,00:12:58,- Why am I holding a nipple?
00:12:58,00:13:01,(all laughing)
00:13:01,00:13:03,"- Wait, sorry, why was he on speakerphone?"
00:13:03,00:13:04,'Cause he wasn't there.
00:13:04,00:13:06,"- No, no, sorry, the basketball player was there."
00:13:06,00:13:08,The vet was-- - The vet?
00:13:08,00:13:09,- Who needed to guide them?
00:13:09,00:13:10,"The expert vet, who knew all that."
00:13:10,00:13:13,- You're not gonna turn up to the most interesting
00:13:13,00:13:15,dolphin-based event of your life.
00:13:15,00:13:18,He was staying in the Holiday Inn up in the next town.
00:13:18,00:13:19,It was too good to make. - My gosh.
00:13:19,00:13:21,- They didn't have much time.
00:13:21,00:13:22,"- And they said, once his arm was in,"
00:13:22,00:13:24,"it was three minutes, and after that,"
00:13:24,00:13:25,the dolphin would suffocate.
00:13:25,00:13:27,"And he had to get all the way down, wave his arm."
00:13:27,00:13:28,"- Wait, he's got a bow hole?"
00:13:28,00:13:29,- What?
00:13:29,00:13:30,- He's got a bow hole?
00:13:30,00:13:30,- It'd have been dumb.
00:13:30,00:13:33,(all laughing)
00:13:33,00:13:36,- There's four dolphins.
00:13:36,00:13:38,- It turns out there's just one dolphin in the world.
00:13:38,00:13:40,There's this guy.
00:13:40,00:13:42,"- Can I ask a question, if they're short on time,"
00:13:42,00:13:44,the dolphin is obviously in one place.
00:13:44,00:13:46,"They immediately go, who's got long arms"
00:13:46,00:13:49,"in the immediate vicinity, and he happens to be in town?"
00:13:49,00:13:51,"- Well, he's from California, so it was the same state."
00:13:51,00:13:52,"- Okay, right."
00:13:52,00:13:54,- And they needed really long arms.
00:13:54,00:13:55,- Right.
00:13:55,00:13:56,"- Like, not just like you're a bit tall."
00:13:56,00:13:57,- Mr. Tickle was embossed.
00:13:57,00:14:00,(all laughing)
00:14:00,00:14:01,"- Wait, he did it, he did it."
00:14:01,00:14:04,"He did it with only, when there were 15 seconds to spare,"
00:14:04,00:14:06,he says he just remembers the vet on the other end of the line.
00:14:06,00:14:10,- Did they have a big basketball club ticking down?
00:14:10,00:14:11,"- Come on, time out."
00:14:11,00:14:14,(all laughing)
00:14:14,00:14:16,"- What if he didn't, he would die."
00:14:16,00:14:17,- Would have suffocated him.
00:14:17,00:14:19,- And did Mr. Spock live long and prosper?
00:14:19,00:14:21,"- Hey, there we go."
00:14:21,00:14:23,- And there we go.
00:14:23,00:14:24,- A gentle end to a very upsetting story.
00:14:24,00:14:26,(all laughing)
00:14:26,00:14:29,(upbeat music)
00:14:29,00:14:34,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna."
00:14:34,00:14:36,- My fact this week is that the adult
00:14:36,00:14:38,who's come closest to freezing to death
00:14:38,00:14:40,"and being brought back to life,"
00:14:40,00:14:43,got together with the person who resuscitated her.
00:14:43,00:14:44,- Mmm.
00:14:44,00:14:48,- Was it Anna from Frozen?
00:14:48,00:14:49,- It should have been.
00:14:49,00:14:51,- Maybe that's who Anna from Frozen was named after.
00:14:51,00:14:52,"- It is not, it is Anna."
00:14:52,00:14:53,"- 'Cause she is called Anna, isn't it?"
00:14:53,00:14:55,"- Yes, yes."
00:14:55,00:14:56,- Anna Bagenholm.
00:14:56,00:14:58,"- Anna Bagenholm, who's Swedish,"
00:14:58,00:15:00,but she was in Norway at the time.
00:15:00,00:15:02,"This is, I don't know why I'm speaking like that."
00:15:02,00:15:06,"This was 1999, and she was skiing with two colleagues."
00:15:06,00:15:07,"And it's just the most amazing story,"
00:15:07,00:15:08,"so I'll do a short version,"
00:15:08,00:15:10,and then we'll probably do a long version.
00:15:10,00:15:12,"Basically, she's skiing, she plunges head first"
00:15:12,00:15:14,"through a massive layer of ice,"
00:15:14,00:15:17,"and she's stuck there for ages and ages,"
00:15:17,00:15:20,"and she gets very bad hypothermia,"
00:15:20,00:15:23,"her heart stops beating, her breathing stops, she's dead."
00:15:23,00:15:25,She's completely dead.
00:15:25,00:15:27,And then eventually she gets extracted from the ice.
00:15:27,00:15:31,"And the crucial thing that happens as soon as she's extracted,"
00:15:31,00:15:32,and very important to remember this
00:15:32,00:15:33,"for any hypothermia sufferers,"
00:15:33,00:15:35,is that she received CPR straight away
00:15:35,00:15:38,from her two colleagues who've been skiing with her.
00:15:38,00:15:42,"One of whom was a chap called Torvind Nysheim,"
00:15:42,00:15:43,"who gave her CPR,"
00:15:43,00:15:45,and it seemed to have absolutely no effect at the time.
00:15:45,00:15:47,"- The other one's going, ""Let it go!"""
00:15:47,00:15:48,"- Oh, my God."
00:15:48,00:15:49,"- Oh, Jesus Christ."
00:15:49,00:15:54,"James is poised to use that in the body as possible,"
00:15:54,00:15:56,but have you got that out of your system?
00:15:56,00:15:58,Yeah? No more famous lyrics than that?
00:15:58,00:15:59,- I don't know any of this.
00:15:59,00:16:02,"- Okay, I think that's a relief for everyone."
00:16:02,00:16:05,"Anyway, it's thought the CPR probably saved her life,"
00:16:05,00:16:07,along with a bunch of other incredible doctors.
00:16:07,00:16:07,"When she got to hospital,"
00:16:07,00:16:10,"there were over a hundred doctors in the room,"
00:16:10,00:16:12,or medical staff in the room with her.
00:16:12,00:16:15,"And she did live, and then a few years later,"
00:16:15,00:16:17,she got together with this chap.
00:16:17,00:16:20,"And I believe, as of 2022, they were still together."
00:16:20,00:16:21,"- Oh, lovely."
00:16:21,00:16:23,"- But really, this was a way of crowbaring"
00:16:23,00:16:26,this amazing story into a Valentine's special.
00:16:26,00:16:27,"- Yeah, it is an amazing story."
00:16:27,00:16:29,"And at that time, they thought,"
00:16:29,00:16:30,"""No way she's coming back."""
00:16:30,00:16:31,"For all the doctors, she was literally,"
00:16:31,00:16:34,"this was medicine into the unknown, right?"
00:16:34,00:16:37,"It was, that's a Frozen 2 song, just for you all there."
00:16:37,00:16:37,- It wasn't.
00:16:37,00:16:38,- Medicine into the unknown.
00:16:38,00:16:39,"Oh, into the unknown, sorry."
00:16:39,00:16:41,Medicine into the unknown.
00:16:41,00:16:44,(laughing)
00:16:44,00:16:46,"- Frozen 2, she becomes a GP, she, yeah."
00:16:46,00:16:49,"- There's a polar bear who's swallowed a plastic bag,"
00:16:49,00:16:52,and we need the world's best curling team
00:16:52,00:16:53,to go and get it out.
00:16:53,00:16:56,- This was a phenomenal thing.
00:16:56,00:16:58,"They thought, ""No way is she gonna survive,"""
00:16:58,00:17:01,"except they seem to have a phrase there, the doctors,"
00:17:01,00:17:02,"which is something like,"
00:17:02,00:17:04,"""You're not dead until we warm you up first."""
00:17:04,00:17:06,So no one who's cold can be declared dead.
00:17:06,00:17:08,You've got to bring them back to war.
00:17:08,00:17:09,"- I think that's true around the world,"
00:17:09,00:17:12,"and it's a really crucial thing about being that cold,"
00:17:12,00:17:15,"because, again, this is what a lot of hypothermia sites say."
00:17:15,00:17:17,"They're like, ""Don't assume they're dead, no heart rate,"
00:17:17,00:17:20,"""no breathing, pallid skin, why is she,"
00:17:20,00:17:22,"""but it could be that once you warm them up again,"
00:17:22,00:17:23,"""you come back to life."""
00:17:23,00:17:24,"- It's like a goldfish, isn't it?"
00:17:24,00:17:26,"If your goldfish is floating upside down,"
00:17:26,00:17:27,it might not be dead.
00:17:27,00:17:29,It might just have a swim bladder problem.
00:17:29,00:17:30,- Is that so?
00:17:30,00:17:30,- Yeah.
00:17:30,00:17:31,- So don't flush it down the toilet.
00:17:31,00:17:32,- That's really good advice.
00:17:32,00:17:34,- And in the same way with these people.
00:17:34,00:17:36,"- Yeah, don't flush them down, as they do."
00:17:36,00:17:38,Ignore it when they're done.
00:17:38,00:17:41,"- So this accident she had, she was skiing,"
00:17:41,00:17:43,"she had a fall, she went through a hole in the ice,"
00:17:43,00:17:46,"eight inches of ice, thick ice,"
00:17:46,00:17:48,and she was trapped under the water.
00:17:48,00:17:49,"Her clothes are immediately soaked,"
00:17:49,00:17:51,therefore they're very heavy.
00:17:51,00:17:54,"The shock paralyzes your muscles, so you can't move, right?"
00:17:54,00:17:56,"So her friends catch up with her, they--"
00:17:56,00:17:58,"- And they can only see her feet in skiing, can they?"
00:17:58,00:18:00,"- They can only see her feet, they cannot pull her out,"
00:18:00,00:18:02,because just the position she's in.
00:18:02,00:18:05,"- And also just this is, 'cause she's in the water,"
00:18:05,00:18:07,"she's submerged, it's a random air pocket"
00:18:07,00:18:09,that her face happens to be next to
00:18:09,00:18:11,that allows for her to keep breathing in there.
00:18:11,00:18:13,"- It's stunning, so she's breathing for seven minutes,"
00:18:13,00:18:16,but she's in the water for 40 minutes.
00:18:16,00:18:19,"A team of rescuers arrive, they can't get her out"
00:18:19,00:18:20,"with a rope or a snow shovel,"
00:18:20,00:18:21,it's not thick enough to get through the ice.
00:18:21,00:18:25,"So she's there, I think another 30 or 40 minutes."
00:18:25,00:18:25,"- Another 40 minutes, yeah."
00:18:25,00:18:27,"- And then a team arrives with a pointy shovel,"
00:18:27,00:18:30,which they use to dig through the ice and get her out.
00:18:30,00:18:34,So she's been in the water for 80 minutes freezing.
00:18:34,00:18:37,"She's white, she's cold, nothing, nothing is happening."
00:18:37,00:18:38,It's just extraordinary.
00:18:38,00:18:40,"- It's amazing. - Well, she's dead."
00:18:40,00:18:41,- She's dead. - She's dead.
00:18:41,00:18:42,"- She's dead, well, except she's not."
00:18:42,00:18:44,"- Well, I mean, what's the definition of death?"
00:18:44,00:18:46,"- Exactly, is she warm?"
00:18:46,00:18:48,"I don't think so, guys."
00:18:48,00:18:49,"- Good point, good point."
00:18:49,00:18:51,She had no heartbeat for four hours
00:18:51,00:18:52,between when her head went through the ice
00:18:52,00:18:54,and when her heart rate came back.
00:18:54,00:18:56,"- Extraordinary, and it was like nine hours,"
00:18:56,00:18:59,and they say like hundreds of doctors and nurses
00:18:59,00:19:01,"who were just working on her the entire time,"
00:19:01,00:19:04,"just trying to bring her back, and they did it."
00:19:04,00:19:07,"And when they did, she was paralyzed to begin with"
00:19:07,00:19:10,"and pissed off, so why did you bring me back?"
00:19:10,00:19:11,Why did you make me become alive again?
00:19:11,00:19:12,I now have to live a life
00:19:12,00:19:15,where I'm not gonna be the person that I wanted to be.
00:19:15,00:19:17,And she eventually calmed down.
00:19:17,00:19:19,"- Well, after she realized she wasn't paralyzed."
00:19:19,00:19:19,"- It took a long time, though,"
00:19:19,00:19:22,for her to get her body completely back to normal.
00:19:22,00:19:23,"- I think it was within not too long, actually."
00:19:23,00:19:25,And then she did apologize.
00:19:25,00:19:27,"So, yeah, not the romantic reunion initially"
00:19:27,00:19:29,"with poor old Naishim, who's like,"
00:19:29,00:19:30,"""Oh, she's gonna fall in love with me now,"" in her eyes."
00:19:30,00:19:32,- And then her heart melted.
00:19:32,00:19:35,"- Ah, it's Valentine's Day."
00:19:35,00:19:36,- I love it.
00:19:36,00:19:39,"- The thing, I find it nuts is she's skewed again."
00:19:39,00:19:40,- Absolute loon.
00:19:40,00:19:41,She's really into downhill skiing.
00:19:41,00:19:43,"- Six years later, she's skewed again."
00:19:43,00:19:43,Just extraordinary.
00:19:43,00:19:46,- Did she stay on peace from that one?
00:19:46,00:19:47,- I don't know.
00:19:47,00:19:48,"- No, I think she's into--"
00:19:48,00:19:49,- She just went to the cafe a bit.
00:19:49,00:19:51,(all laughing)
00:19:51,00:19:53,- I believe she's really into extreme skiing still.
00:19:53,00:19:54,- Really?
00:19:54,00:19:55,- Because people are insane.
00:19:55,00:19:57,- Can we say what she got down to?
00:19:57,00:20:02,"So, normally, your core temperature is 37 degrees, right?"
00:20:02,00:20:05,"If your core goes down below 35,"
00:20:05,00:20:08,you're officially in hypothermia.
00:20:08,00:20:13,Her core temperature went down to 13.7 degrees Celsius.
00:20:13,00:20:17,"- And then a bit later, there was a kid who went to 13,"
00:20:17,00:20:19,who's the coldest anyone has ever been.
00:20:19,00:20:20,- Yeah.
00:20:20,00:20:24,"- And apparently, this is more common to work in children."
00:20:24,00:20:26,This idea of sort of freezing yourself
00:20:26,00:20:27,and then coming back to life.
00:20:27,00:20:30,And it's because you have a greater surface area
00:20:30,00:20:32,"compared to your volume,"
00:20:32,00:20:34,which means that you cool down a lot quicker.
00:20:34,00:20:36,"- Oh, of course, and that's why--"
00:20:36,00:20:38,- And you wanna do that quick freezing at the start.
00:20:38,00:20:38,That's kind of how it works.
00:20:38,00:20:40,"- So, that's why you need to keep babies warm at night"
00:20:40,00:20:42,'cause they cool down faster.
00:20:42,00:20:44,"So, the thing is when you get really, really cold,"
00:20:44,00:20:48,the oxygen demand of your brain lowers drastically.
00:20:48,00:20:51,"And if you're cold enough before your heart stops,"
00:20:51,00:20:52,that's the key.
00:20:52,00:20:54,That's why doing the CPR is so important.
00:20:54,00:20:56,"Then the cell death, which normally happens"
00:20:56,00:20:59,"when you don't have any circulation, it doesn't happen."
00:20:59,00:21:01,"So, her brain needed no oxygen, basically."
00:21:01,00:21:02,"- I think it was like, it had 10%"
00:21:02,00:21:05,of the oxygen requirements of your brain normally.
00:21:05,00:21:05,"- Oh, sorry, go on."
00:21:05,00:21:07,"- Well, just to say that because this happened,"
00:21:07,00:21:11,they're now using the idea of freezing people down.
00:21:11,00:21:14,If people have had a stroke or if they've had liver failure
00:21:14,00:21:15,"or something like that,"
00:21:15,00:21:18,"the idea now is get people really, really, really cold"
00:21:18,00:21:20,and they might survive.
00:21:20,00:21:23,"- Yes, and in fact, even though it's quite standard now"
00:21:23,00:21:24,"or it's done a lot,"
00:21:24,00:21:27,but we actually don't know why it works.
00:21:27,00:21:29,"And they think that actually,"
00:21:29,00:21:31,"it's not about the effects of your heart stopping,"
00:21:31,00:21:34,which deprives your brain of oxygen.
00:21:34,00:21:36,It's actually about when your heart starts again.
00:21:36,00:21:38,"And I didn't know this, but if you have a heart attack"
00:21:38,00:21:40,"or if your heart stops,"
00:21:40,00:21:42,one of the really common ways that you die
00:21:42,00:21:44,is when your heart starts again.
00:21:44,00:21:46,And it's this thing called reperfusion.
00:21:46,00:21:49,"And it means that if your heart's been stopped for long enough,"
00:21:49,00:21:52,then all the chemistry in your brain has changed so much
00:21:52,00:21:54,in ways that they don't quite understand.
00:21:54,00:21:56,"If blood suddenly floods back in there,"
00:21:56,00:21:58,it completely messes it up and you die.
00:21:58,00:21:59,"- Oh, wow."
00:21:59,00:22:00,"- And so in this way,"
00:22:00,00:22:02,I think it allows that to happen much more gradually
00:22:02,00:22:04,or it slows the brain down
00:22:04,00:22:06,and allows it to be a bit more controlled.
00:22:06,00:22:08,- Is the word reaper a deliberate use there
00:22:08,00:22:11,"of the danger, reperfusion?"
00:22:11,00:22:13,"- No, it's not reperfusion."
00:22:13,00:22:14,"- I see, it's not that-- - I think it's probably"
00:22:14,00:22:16,just reperfusion again. - Perfusion with the ray
00:22:16,00:22:16,on the front.
00:22:16,00:22:18,"- Yeah, the standard prefix, re."
00:22:18,00:22:18,- Interesting.
00:22:18,00:22:21,- It should put the A in though.
00:22:21,00:22:23,Did you guys read about the two things that happen
00:22:23,00:22:26,when you have hypothermia that are most bizarre?
00:22:26,00:22:27,"- Oh, yeah, yes."
00:22:27,00:22:29,"If someone has died of hypothermia,"
00:22:29,00:22:31,"you shouldn't just look on the floor,"
00:22:31,00:22:34,look in all the crevices and look in all the shelving units
00:22:34,00:22:35,because they might be curled up in there
00:22:35,00:22:38,because it's a reaction. - Terminal burrowing.
00:22:38,00:22:39,"- Terminal burrowing, yeah."
00:22:39,00:22:40,That was interesting.
00:22:40,00:22:42,"The other one is taking your clothes off, isn't it?"
00:22:42,00:22:43,"- Yes, and it seems to happen a lot."
00:22:43,00:22:45,"There was one study that was done that looked,"
00:22:45,00:22:47,"I think, about 70 people who died of hypothermia"
00:22:47,00:22:49,and it found almost all of them
00:22:49,00:22:51,"did this thing called terminal burrowing,"
00:22:51,00:22:54,"which, as you say, is where you crawl under a bed"
00:22:54,00:22:57,or behind a cupboard or onto a shelf.
00:22:57,00:22:58,"And it just feels like, you know,"
00:22:58,00:22:59,"when you have a cat who's dying,"
00:22:59,00:23:02,it crawls to the very corner under a bed.
00:23:02,00:23:04,It's like the last protective hibernation thing.
00:23:04,00:23:05,"- Like a really deep instinct, basically."
00:23:05,00:23:06,"- Yes, deep."
00:23:06,00:23:09,And the other thing that a quarter of the people did
00:23:09,00:23:11,"was this thing called paradoxical undressing,"
00:23:11,00:23:13,"which, again, people who've had hypothermia"
00:23:13,00:23:15,often found completely naked.
00:23:15,00:23:18,"And that's because, at first, you know,"
00:23:18,00:23:20,you have vasodilation where all your veins
00:23:20,00:23:22,in your extremities constricts
00:23:22,00:23:24,to try and flood blood to your internal organs
00:23:24,00:23:26,to keep you warm when you've got hypothermia.
00:23:26,00:23:27,But then that takes loads and loads of effort
00:23:27,00:23:29,for your muscles and your body just gives up.
00:23:29,00:23:31,All the blood floods back to your extremities
00:23:31,00:23:32,"and so suddenly you're like,"
00:23:32,00:23:34,"""God, bizarrely, I'm really hot."""
00:23:34,00:23:36,And you take off all your clothes.
00:23:36,00:23:37,So hot.
00:23:37,00:23:39,- So maybe the song that's getting hot in here
00:23:39,00:23:41,is actually the last throes of someone
00:23:41,00:23:42,who's suffering severe hypothermia.
00:23:42,00:23:43,"- That's what it's about, yeah."
00:23:43,00:23:46,"- Yeah, the lyric is from Scott's diary, isn't it?"
00:23:46,00:23:47,(laughing)
00:23:47,00:23:49,(upbeat music)
00:23:52,00:23:55,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:23:55,00:23:56,and that is James.
00:23:56,00:23:58,"- Okay, my fact this week is that if ancient"
00:23:58,00:24:01,"Mesopotamia had Valentine's cards,"
00:24:01,00:24:04,they would probably contain pictures of knees.
00:24:04,00:24:07,"- So we've had the flirting,"
00:24:07,00:24:10,"we've now got together with Torvind,"
00:24:10,00:24:11,and now we're sending each other Valentine's cards.
00:24:11,00:24:12,- Now we're on our knees.
00:24:12,00:24:14,"- We should've done it the other way around, shouldn't we?"
00:24:14,00:24:15,You don't send a Valentine's card
00:24:15,00:24:16,once you've got together with someone.
00:24:16,00:24:18,"- Anna, this is exactly what I said to these guys"
00:24:18,00:24:19,before we came on air.
00:24:19,00:24:20,"- And I disagree, Anna."
00:24:20,00:24:21,I think it's much more common.
00:24:21,00:24:23,I think most Valentine's cards are bought by people
00:24:23,00:24:27,joylessly on the 13th of February in a train station.
00:24:27,00:24:29,(laughing)
00:24:29,00:24:31,"- I thought you always put, like,"
00:24:31,00:24:34,"from anonymous on your Valentine's cards,"
00:24:34,00:24:35,that's the whole point of them.
00:24:35,00:24:37,"- I put anonymous on all the ones I send,"
00:24:37,00:24:38,apart from the one to my wife.
00:24:38,00:24:41,(laughing)
00:24:41,00:24:42,- Should I explain the fact?
00:24:42,00:24:43,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:24:43,00:24:45,"- So this is a new study about,"
00:24:45,00:24:48,they looked at a load of cuneiform texts.
00:24:48,00:24:51,"This is some scientists at the University of Finland,"
00:24:51,00:24:54,and they looked at loads of phrases
00:24:54,00:24:55,"that are about emotions,"
00:24:55,00:24:57,and they looked at what parts of the body
00:24:57,00:25:00,were used in those phrases.
00:25:00,00:25:03,And they found that happiness is mostly felt
00:25:03,00:25:05,"in the liver, for instance."
00:25:05,00:25:07,Shard and Freud are mostly in the lip.
00:25:07,00:25:09,- Amazing that Shard and Freud was on the list
00:25:09,00:25:11,"of what was a really basic,"
00:25:11,00:25:14,"it was like happy, sad, anger, Shard and Freud are."
00:25:14,00:25:15,- On the lip?
00:25:15,00:25:16,"- On the lip, yeah."
00:25:16,00:25:17,- You kind of curl your lip.
00:25:17,00:25:21,"- And they found that love was in order,"
00:25:21,00:25:25,"in the knee, liver, heart, back, and male genitalia."
00:25:25,00:25:28,- Sounds about right.
00:25:28,00:25:30,"- That's like that song, my neck, my back."
00:25:30,00:25:32,"- It's like, head, shoulder, knee, my liver."
00:25:32,00:25:35,"- Like, head, shoulders, knees and toes."
00:25:35,00:25:37,"Knee, liver, heart and back, genitalia."
00:25:37,00:25:41,"- I would struggle to pinpoint where my liver was,"
00:25:41,00:25:42,as in if I wouldn't know where to say
00:25:42,00:25:44,if I was feeling something in my liver.
00:25:44,00:25:46,- The reason that that is a thing is that
00:25:46,00:25:48,"when you open up a body after someone's died,"
00:25:48,00:25:51,"the liver is so big compared to everything else,"
00:25:51,00:25:53,you would naturally think that was a really important
00:25:53,00:25:54,part of the body.
00:25:54,00:25:56,"- I'm just really impressed that they had that knowledge of,"
00:25:56,00:25:58,"as in like, that knowledge was widespread,"
00:25:58,00:25:59,that that was a phrase.
00:25:59,00:26:00,"- Well, they didn't know where it was, I suppose,"
00:26:00,00:26:01,necessarily if you were an ordinary guy.
00:26:01,00:26:03,"You'd just say, like, in the same way,"
00:26:03,00:26:04,"I'd say my heart bleeds for you,"
00:26:04,00:26:06,"and that would, I guess, show sympathy"
00:26:06,00:26:07,and you'd say it's associated with the heart.
00:26:07,00:26:10,"You might say, oh, my liver erupts with rage."
00:26:10,00:26:12,"But it is true, the liver seems to have been the heart"
00:26:12,00:26:16,for hundreds and hundreds of years and loads of civilizations.
00:26:16,00:26:18,"And they had, it was so important that they thought"
00:26:18,00:26:21,that gods imprinted their desires on livers.
00:26:21,00:26:23,"So, and this is in ancient Mesopotamia,"
00:26:23,00:26:26,"but when you sacrifice a sheep, let's say,"
00:26:26,00:26:28,its liver would then be taken out
00:26:28,00:26:30,and they used to make clay liver models
00:26:30,00:26:32,of the exact shape of the liver
00:26:32,00:26:34,that that sheep had had inside it.
00:26:34,00:26:35,And then they would analyze the models
00:26:35,00:26:38,like you'd read a poem and that would tell them the future.
00:26:38,00:26:41,'Cause they thought the god will have put their desire
00:26:41,00:26:44,and the future onto the liver shape of this sheep.
00:26:44,00:26:45,- But how do you know you've got the right sheep?
00:26:45,00:26:47,It just feels like a very inefficient system.
00:26:47,00:26:49,"- I think God knows, I think maybe God changes the shape"
00:26:49,00:26:50,as it's being sacrificed.
00:26:50,00:26:52,So God sees that you're sacrificing that sheep
00:26:52,00:26:54,and then quickly molds the liver into that shape.
00:26:54,00:26:55,I'm not sure exactly that logic.
00:26:55,00:26:57,"- No, we shouldn't, we shouldn't try."
00:26:57,00:26:59,"Where is Mesopotamia again, is it Turkey?"
00:26:59,00:27:00,- Iraq.
00:27:00,00:27:01,"- Iraq, yeah."
00:27:01,00:27:04,"And we're talking 2,500 BC-ish."
00:27:04,00:27:05,- Long time ago.
00:27:05,00:27:06,"- Oh, it's a very long time ago."
00:27:06,00:27:07,But this is--
00:27:07,00:27:08,- That is civilization.
00:27:08,00:27:09,- It sort of is.
00:27:09,00:27:11,We're all this writing these cuneiform tablets.
00:27:11,00:27:13,And so we keep finding out more and more about it
00:27:13,00:27:14,'cause more are found.
00:27:14,00:27:15,They've survived the test of time.
00:27:15,00:27:17,These amazing clay tablets that are found
00:27:17,00:27:19,in their hundreds and thousands in hordes
00:27:19,00:27:20,whenever they--
00:27:20,00:27:21,"- It's 'cause they're made of clay, right?"
00:27:21,00:27:22,"- Exactly, yeah, it was--"
00:27:22,00:27:24,- Not like Balencian's cards.
00:27:24,00:27:27,"- Exactly, for all we know, there were millions of them."
00:27:27,00:27:29,So it was a huge trade back then.
00:27:29,00:27:31,'Cause it was thought up until recently
00:27:31,00:27:35,"that 1,500 BC was when we started kissing."
00:27:35,00:27:37,- You mean the oldest depiction we found
00:27:37,00:27:38,or we actually found a couple locked in--
00:27:38,00:27:41,"- No, the oldest depiction of it."
00:27:41,00:27:43,But actually we now have records via cuneiform
00:27:43,00:27:45,that show us that back then they were very romantic
00:27:45,00:27:47,"and they were kissing and not just within marriage,"
00:27:47,00:27:51,they were also kissing as dates and socially and so on.
00:27:51,00:27:54,And there's only one other major contestant
00:27:54,00:27:57,"to say that it's older, which is a kiss"
00:27:57,00:27:59,that may have happened between a Neanderthal
00:27:59,00:28:01,"and a human over 100,000 years ago."
00:28:01,00:28:04,And they know this because they found a microbe inside
00:28:04,00:28:09,"on the skull of a human, but you would only get it"
00:28:09,00:28:09,from a Neanderthal.
00:28:09,00:28:12,So they know that a bit of tonsil hockey was going on.
00:28:12,00:28:13,"- Well, they were playing that game where you--"
00:28:13,00:28:15,"- Pass a balloon. - Pass a egg, pass a balloon."
00:28:15,00:28:16,"- Oh, an egg. - An egg?"
00:28:16,00:28:19,"- You pass on, is it not an egg from one mouth to the next?"
00:28:19,00:28:20,What did you think it was?
00:28:20,00:28:21,- It was of a big mouth.
00:28:21,00:28:22,- Those are quite big.
00:28:22,00:28:23,"- Yeah, you could do it with a quail's egg."
00:28:23,00:28:25,"But again, that's quite socially restrictive."
00:28:25,00:28:26,- Was it like scrambled or poached
00:28:26,00:28:28,or the kind of egg which is--
00:28:28,00:28:30,- I'm thinking in shell.
00:28:30,00:28:31,I'm sure we did it with eggs.
00:28:31,00:28:33,"- I mean, you can fit an egg in your mouth,"
00:28:33,00:28:34,"but it is a choking hazard,"
00:28:34,00:28:35,"I would say. - Oh, yeah."
00:28:35,00:28:37,"It's not sexy, I think."
00:28:37,00:28:39,"Ugh, it's locked behind my teeth."
00:28:39,00:28:41,(laughing)
00:28:41,00:28:42,- I've misunderstood the rules.
00:28:42,00:28:43,- That's very funny.
00:28:43,00:28:44,"That's, yeah."
00:28:44,00:28:46,"I mean, we say I go weak at the knees."
00:28:46,00:28:48,"- Yes, exactly, I was thinking that, yeah."
00:28:48,00:28:51,"Yeah, I think knees would be in our list of things."
00:28:51,00:28:54,"The weird thing I found was under sexual attraction,"
00:28:54,00:28:57,which was one of the simple emotions they had.
00:28:57,00:28:59,"The six body parts, was it five?"
00:28:59,00:29:02,Five body parts associated with that.
00:29:02,00:29:04,"Well, what would you guess was in there?"
00:29:04,00:29:06,"Eyes, you would think, right?"
00:29:06,00:29:07,"- I would have thought, firstly, genitals."
00:29:07,00:29:09,"I mean, genitals feature so much"
00:29:09,00:29:10,"in so many other emotions,"
00:29:10,00:29:13,like kind of distress or contempt.
00:29:13,00:29:16,"Sexual attraction, genitals and penis aren't in there."
00:29:16,00:29:19,"It's head, knee, neck, hand and ankle."
00:29:19,00:29:23,"- Head, knee, knee, neck, neck and ankle."
00:29:23,00:29:25,"- Ankle's a bit of an odd one, isn't it?"
00:29:25,00:29:27,"- Well, like Victorians."
00:29:27,00:29:28,Like Chilbert and Ankle.
00:29:28,00:29:31,"- Yeah, if you've got restrictive social practices."
00:29:31,00:29:32,- What period are we talking about?
00:29:32,00:29:33,- This is the same study.
00:29:33,00:29:34,- This is ancient Mesopotamia.
00:29:34,00:29:35,"- Oh, right."
00:29:35,00:29:37,'Cause there's a whole subcategory now
00:29:37,00:29:39,of celebrity spotting on celebrities' knees.
00:29:39,00:29:40,- Not that period.
00:29:40,00:29:41,We're not looking at that period.
00:29:41,00:29:42,- Is it like wiki knees or something?
00:29:42,00:29:45,"- No, it's like how if we look at a sort of photo"
00:29:45,00:29:46,"of Meghan Markle, you'll see Casper,"
00:29:46,00:29:48,the friendly ghost's face on her knee.
00:29:48,00:29:50,"- Oh, there was a thing where,"
00:29:50,00:29:52,"oh no, I'm getting it wrong."
00:29:52,00:29:54,I thought Sandy Tuxwick might have been on someone's knees.
00:29:54,00:29:55,"- She was, exactly."
00:29:55,00:29:56,"Yeah, yeah."
00:29:56,00:29:58,There's a lot of faces that are appearing on knees recently.
00:29:58,00:30:00,"- I would presume it's normally,"
00:30:00,00:30:02,"I mean, no disrespect to the glorious Sandy."
00:30:02,00:30:04,It's normally people with quite wrinkly faces
00:30:04,00:30:06,who are being spotted in other people's knees.
00:30:06,00:30:07,- No.
00:30:07,00:30:08,"- It surely is very rarely,"
00:30:08,00:30:10,"'cause knees are knobbly, you know, wrinkly."
00:30:10,00:30:11,- Wrinkly?
00:30:11,00:30:12,My knees are perfectly smooth.
00:30:12,00:30:13,- Oh. - Yeah.
00:30:13,00:30:14,"- Casper the friendly ghost,"
00:30:14,00:30:15,doesn't ever notice that.
00:30:15,00:30:17,"- Anna, you've been having routine knee Botox knees."
00:30:17,00:30:19,(laughing)
00:30:19,00:30:21,"- Knees, they have a lot of nerve endings."
00:30:21,00:30:23,So they are known as an erogenous zone.
00:30:23,00:30:26,And that's because you have nerves that go through your knee
00:30:26,00:30:27,that do everything that in your feet
00:30:27,00:30:29,and up at the top of your thighs as well.
00:30:29,00:30:31,"Basically, all the nerves that are in your leg"
00:30:31,00:30:32,have to go through your knees.
00:30:32,00:30:34,So they have a lot of nerve endings.
00:30:34,00:30:35,- That's good.
00:30:35,00:30:36,"- And the attraction to knees,"
00:30:36,00:30:40,the paraphilia of that is called genufilia.
00:30:40,00:30:41,"- Oh, like genuflecting?"
00:30:41,00:30:43,"- Exactly, yeah."
00:30:43,00:30:44,"Do you want some more of those, by the way?"
00:30:44,00:30:45,"- Yes, please."
00:30:45,00:30:49,- Alvin O'Lagnea is the attraction to--
00:30:49,00:30:51,"- Alvin, a chipmunk, I can eat."
00:30:51,00:30:53,(laughing)
00:30:53,00:30:55,- It's the midriff.
00:30:55,00:30:55,- Okay.
00:30:55,00:30:57,- The belly button and tummy and stuff.
00:30:57,00:30:58,- Nice.
00:30:58,00:30:59,- Bro midophilia.
00:30:59,00:31:00,- Bro.
00:31:00,00:31:01,"- Yeah, it's like--"
00:31:01,00:31:02,- Podcasters.
00:31:02,00:31:03,(laughing)
00:31:03,00:31:05,- It's the attraction to body odor.
00:31:05,00:31:06,"- Oh, wow."
00:31:06,00:31:10,- And matiaphilia is tough.
00:31:10,00:31:14,It's the attraction to non-normal looking eyes.
00:31:14,00:31:17,And it comes from the Greek term for the evil eye.
00:31:17,00:31:18,- Hard.
00:31:18,00:31:20,- Like those dogs that have one eye of different colors.
00:31:20,00:31:21,"- Like David Bowie, I guess."
00:31:21,00:31:22,- And like David Bowie.
00:31:22,00:31:23,- Quite a few of those.
00:31:23,00:31:25,"I would think of not sort of unnatural attractions,"
00:31:25,00:31:27,"like midriffs, you know, a traditionally,"
00:31:27,00:31:28,a slightly sexy thing.
00:31:28,00:31:29,So I've got the midriff out.
00:31:29,00:31:31,- It's interesting 'cause a paraffilia by definition
00:31:31,00:31:34,should be attraction to something atypical.
00:31:34,00:31:36,"But then when you look at the list,"
00:31:36,00:31:38,"there was one which is normalphilia,"
00:31:38,00:31:41,which is the attraction to normal things.
00:31:41,00:31:42,(laughing)
00:31:42,00:31:42,- Right.
00:31:42,00:31:44,- So is that normal things to be attracted to
00:31:44,00:31:46,or normal things like a table?
00:31:46,00:31:46,(laughing)
00:31:46,00:31:47,That is unusual.
00:31:47,00:31:48,"- Oh, that is unusual."
00:31:48,00:31:50,"Then yeah, I read one earlier today, weirdly,"
00:31:50,00:31:52,nothing to do with this about being sexually attracted
00:31:52,00:31:54,to people falling downstairs.
00:31:54,00:31:54,(laughing)
00:31:54,00:31:55,- What?
00:31:55,00:31:57,- And that's why you always sit down to watch an episode
00:31:57,00:31:58,you'd be afraid of.
00:31:58,00:31:59,(laughing)
00:31:59,00:32:01,- His pants around his ankles.
00:32:01,00:32:03,(laughing)
00:32:03,00:32:04,- Setting my family out of the room.
00:32:04,00:32:06,"- Right, everyone out."
00:32:06,00:32:08,- If you've got any videos of yourself falling downstairs
00:32:08,00:32:11,and send it to dad and he'll give you 250 pounds.
00:32:11,00:32:13,(laughing)
00:32:13,00:32:18,"- All right, here's a little micro quiz."
00:32:18,00:32:21,Which of these phrases is the oldest?
00:32:21,00:32:23,I'm gonna give you three.
00:32:23,00:32:24,To have someone over your knee.
00:32:25,00:32:27,- Like to spank them kind of thing.
00:32:27,00:32:28,- That's the implication.
00:32:28,00:32:29,- Right.
00:32:29,00:32:30,- A knee slapper.
00:32:30,00:32:31,- That's a joke.
00:32:31,00:32:32,- That's a joke.
00:32:32,00:32:35,And upon the knees of the gods.
00:32:35,00:32:36,"- Oh, I don't know what that one means."
00:32:36,00:32:38,So that's why I would say that would be the oldest
00:32:38,00:32:38,'cause I've never heard of it.
00:32:38,00:32:40,- Okay.
00:32:40,00:32:41,- Do you mean thigh slapper?
00:32:41,00:32:42,I've never heard of a knee slapper.
00:32:42,00:32:44,- A knee slapper is the phrase.
00:32:44,00:32:44,- Is it?
00:32:44,00:32:45,- Yeah.
00:32:45,00:32:46,I think thigh slapper too.
00:32:46,00:32:47,Depends on how funny the joke is.
00:32:47,00:32:48,- Of course.
00:32:48,00:32:49,"- Well, how long your legs were?"
00:32:49,00:32:49,- And what you wearing?
00:32:49,00:32:51,(laughing)
00:32:51,00:32:52,"- For that basketball player,"
00:32:52,00:32:54,it was an ankle slapper.
00:32:54,00:32:55,(laughing)
00:32:55,00:32:56,- Okay.
00:32:56,00:32:58,James is saying upon the knees of the gods is oldest.
00:32:58,00:33:00,"- Probably knee slapper, I reckon."
00:33:00,00:33:01,"- Yeah, I'm gonna say knee slapper as well"
00:33:01,00:33:03,because I'll do the third one
00:33:03,00:33:04,just for the sake of having a full house.
00:33:04,00:33:05,- To have someone over your knee.
00:33:05,00:33:07,- Yeah.
00:33:07,00:33:10,- Upon the knees of the gods is ancient Greek.
00:33:10,00:33:10,- What does it mean?
00:33:10,00:33:12,"- Well, that's what one would have get."
00:33:12,00:33:13,"- Yeah, that was the obvious one, Andy."
00:33:13,00:33:14,"- Yeah, well, James got there first."
00:33:14,00:33:17,So maybe you two should fuck up your ideas a bit next time.
00:33:17,00:33:19,"- You'd be great in a quiz, Dan."
00:33:19,00:33:21,"It's like, what is the capital of France?"
00:33:21,00:33:21,Paris.
00:33:21,00:33:23,"Oh, that was the obvious answer, guys."
00:33:23,00:33:25,"- We knew that as well, actually."
00:33:25,00:33:26,- It did feel like Andy would be pulling
00:33:26,00:33:28,some sort of rock up run for our feet
00:33:28,00:33:29,rather than just going.
00:33:29,00:33:29,"- No, I'm a nice guy."
00:33:29,00:33:30,I leave the rock under your feet.
00:33:30,00:33:32,"- Right, okay."
00:33:32,00:33:33,- It's the one you're thinking of
00:33:33,00:33:34,is the title of my quiz format.
00:33:34,00:33:37,(laughing)
00:33:37,00:33:39,"It's an ancient Greek phrase, theon engounasi,"
00:33:39,00:33:41,which means it's beyond human control.
00:33:41,00:33:43,"It's like it's in the lap of the gods, actually,"
00:33:43,00:33:44,but it's on the knees of the gods.
00:33:44,00:33:47,"Okay, a knee slapper is from 1955"
00:33:47,00:33:50,"and to have someone over your knee takes to 1866,"
00:33:50,00:33:51,which is quite something
00:33:51,00:33:54,that someone used that phrase on me recently.
00:33:54,00:33:55,- Say the phrase again?
00:33:55,00:33:56,- To have someone over your knee.
00:33:56,00:33:58,- And someone used that on you?
00:33:58,00:33:59,"- Yeah, it was a removals guy"
00:33:59,00:34:01,the last time I was moving in the house.
00:34:01,00:34:02,- Yeah.
00:34:02,00:34:05,"- I'd left something at the bottom of the staircase, right?"
00:34:05,00:34:06,'Cause I was moving down the--
00:34:06,00:34:07,- That's how they fall down the stairs.
00:34:07,00:34:09,(laughing)
00:34:09,00:34:11,"- You haven't sent me that video yet, by the way."
00:34:11,00:34:12,I'd paid good money for that.
00:34:12,00:34:14,- I'd put like a glass picture frame
00:34:14,00:34:15,at the bottom of the stairs
00:34:15,00:34:17,and I hadn't moved it out to the van or whatever.
00:34:17,00:34:19,"And he said, ""I'd have you over my knee"
00:34:19,00:34:20,"if you were one of my boys."""
00:34:20,00:34:22,- It was a whole unusual thing.
00:34:22,00:34:25,- It was much nicer than the way he made it sound.
00:34:25,00:34:26,- I also think that this whole quiz
00:34:26,00:34:28,is leading up to that anecdote.
00:34:28,00:34:29,- Yeah.
00:34:29,00:34:30,- How could you think that?
00:34:30,00:34:32,(laughing)
00:34:32,00:34:33,- When the anecdote was so bad.
00:34:33,00:34:35,(laughing)
00:34:35,00:34:37,- Unless there's one extra bit you're not telling us.
00:34:37,00:34:38,- Nope.
00:34:38,00:34:38,- Okay.
00:34:38,00:34:40,- That's the subtitle of the quiz.
00:34:40,00:34:42,- That's all there is to it.
00:34:42,00:34:43,- That's all there is to it.
00:34:43,00:34:46,"- Um, here's a song from Chicago,"
00:34:46,00:34:48,"which I won't sing, but I'll read you the lyrics."
00:34:48,00:34:49,- The band Chicago.
00:34:49,00:34:51,- Or the musical Chicago.
00:34:51,00:34:51,- The musical.
00:34:51,00:34:53,"- No, the city."
00:34:53,00:34:54,(laughing)
00:34:54,00:34:55,"- That's a buster, isn't it?"
00:34:55,00:34:56,- The pizza company.
00:34:56,00:34:59,"Um, okay, so it's from the musical."
00:34:59,00:35:01,Why don't we paint the town and all that jazz?
00:35:01,00:35:05,I'm gonna rouge my knees and roll my stockings down.
00:35:05,00:35:07,- Yep.
00:35:07,00:35:08,"- That's weird, isn't it?"
00:35:08,00:35:10,"- Yes, why do they, I've never questioned that before."
00:35:10,00:35:12,I'm gonna rouge my knees.
00:35:12,00:35:12,Hmm.
00:35:12,00:35:13,- Carpet burn.
00:35:13,00:35:15,"- It's not carpet burn, Dan."
00:35:15,00:35:16,"Like, why would you,"
00:35:16,00:35:18,why you'd be deliberately faking a carpet burn
00:35:18,00:35:20,on your knees with rouge?
00:35:20,00:35:21,"- Well, that's pretty sexy, isn't it?"
00:35:21,00:35:22,- Yeah.
00:35:22,00:35:23,- You wanna know how I got these knees?
00:35:23,00:35:24,I'll never tell.
00:35:24,00:35:28,"- So yeah, rouge as in makeup, red makeup."
00:35:28,00:35:33,"And this was a popular thing in the flapper period,"
00:35:33,00:35:36,which was to put makeup on your knees.
00:35:36,00:35:38,- Like a little face.
00:35:38,00:35:41,"- In actual fact, sometimes they put,"
00:35:41,00:35:43,there were some images of young women
00:35:43,00:35:46,with quite short skirts and with little faces on their knees.
00:35:46,00:35:49,- Is that one because it's soundly toxic on both knees?
00:35:49,00:35:50,- That's good flirting.
00:35:50,00:35:51,I think that's really good flirting.
00:35:51,00:35:54,"If you're opposite someone on a train, for example,"
00:35:54,00:35:56,"you just, whoop, you hook up your skirt a little bit."
00:35:56,00:35:58,There's your winking face on your knee.
00:35:58,00:36:00,"And then you, you know, you see if they notice."
00:36:00,00:36:02,"- Yeah, it's good."
00:36:02,00:36:02,- Isn't that good?
00:36:02,00:36:04,"I'm sorry, that's creative flirting."
00:36:04,00:36:05,- If you're pulling up your kill
00:36:05,00:36:07,to say that it's winking at you.
00:36:07,00:36:10,(all laughing)
00:36:10,00:36:11,- That's no sparring.
00:36:11,00:36:14,"- But yeah, this was the thing."
00:36:14,00:36:18,It was women had started to be able to show their knees
00:36:18,00:36:20,"and they decided, well, we're going to make the most of it."
00:36:20,00:36:21,And so they started putting makeup on.
00:36:21,00:36:24,"- So it's poor men were suddenly going around saying,"
00:36:24,00:36:26,did you know women's knees have smiley face on them?
00:36:26,00:36:28,(all laughing)
00:36:28,00:36:29,That's amazing.
00:36:29,00:36:30,- That's great.
00:36:30,00:36:33,- Only animal with four knees.
00:36:33,00:36:35,"- Dogs, cats, elephants."
00:36:35,00:36:35,- Quadrupeds.
00:36:35,00:36:36,- Any quadruped.
00:36:36,00:36:39,"- No, no, they don't have countless knees on the back."
00:36:39,00:36:41,No animals have four knees.
00:36:41,00:36:44,"Zero, one animal has four kneecaps."
00:36:44,00:36:45,- Yeah.
00:36:45,00:36:47,- And it only has two legs.
00:36:47,00:36:49,(all laughing)
00:36:49,00:36:49,- I know the answer.
00:36:49,00:36:51,Are we still playing Andy's quiz?
00:36:51,00:36:52,'Cause I can get it if yes.
00:36:52,00:36:55,- This is a horrible riddle in a cave in ancient Greece.
00:36:55,00:36:57,It's ridiculous.
00:36:57,00:36:58,Sorry.
00:36:58,00:36:59,"What you're saying is that all animals,"
00:36:59,00:37:01,"all quadrupeds, they have arms and legs rather."
00:37:01,00:37:02,They may walk around on all fours.
00:37:02,00:37:03,- Exactly.
00:37:03,00:37:04,- But their skeleton structure is.
00:37:04,00:37:06,- They have elbows and knees.
00:37:06,00:37:07,They don't have four knees.
00:37:07,00:37:08,- Exactly.
00:37:08,00:37:08,"Sorry, that's."
00:37:08,00:37:11,- And there's one bipedal one that has four knees.
00:37:11,00:37:12,- We should just let Dan answer.
00:37:12,00:37:15,"- Well, two knees are hidden under a coat of feathers."
00:37:15,00:37:17,"- Oh, they're all hidden."
00:37:17,00:37:18,- Are we talking about the same animal here?
00:37:18,00:37:18,"- Yeah, we are."
00:37:18,00:37:19,I think you just haven't looked
00:37:19,00:37:20,at the diagrams closely enough.
00:37:20,00:37:22,(all laughing)
00:37:22,00:37:23,"- Right, so it's feathered."
00:37:23,00:37:25,"- Okay, if it's two-legged and feathered, an ostrich."
00:37:25,00:37:26,- Yes!
00:37:26,00:37:27,"James, that's very good, actually."
00:37:27,00:37:30,"- Well, it was either that or an emu or a cassowary."
00:37:30,00:37:31,- Whose quiz is better?
00:37:31,00:37:35,"Like mine, where it's to get me into a dull anecdote,"
00:37:35,00:37:37,"or Anna's, where it's a mental shit show."
00:37:37,00:37:39,(all laughing)
00:37:39,00:37:41,"I haven't worked out the format,"
00:37:41,00:37:44,but I think the kernel of an idea is there.
00:37:44,00:37:45,This is really interesting.
00:37:45,00:37:47,We only found out recently that ostriches
00:37:47,00:37:48,have four kneecaps.
00:37:48,00:37:52,"Everything else has two, and sort of four knees."
00:37:52,00:37:54,"So if you look at birds like ostriches,"
00:37:54,00:37:56,"the thing that you might think is a knee,"
00:37:56,00:37:58,"if you're an idiot, is actually the ankle, right?"
00:37:58,00:38:00,Because if you look at those birds--
00:38:00,00:38:02,- The knees are up inside.
00:38:02,00:38:03,"- The knees are up inside the feathers, yeah."
00:38:03,00:38:05,- They've got really long feet bones.
00:38:05,00:38:05,- Exactly.
00:38:05,00:38:07,"- It's like how horses, like the lower half of their leg,"
00:38:07,00:38:08,is actually their middle toe.
00:38:08,00:38:10,"Precisely, all animals like that."
00:38:10,00:38:13,"But up, though, under their feathers,"
00:38:13,00:38:14,they seem to have two sets of knees.
00:38:14,00:38:15,We really don't know why.
00:38:15,00:38:17,"Two sets of knees, two sets of kneecaps."
00:38:17,00:38:20,"And who knows why, but cassowaries and emus"
00:38:20,00:38:22,don't have any at the end.
00:38:22,00:38:23,"Dan, back me up on this."
00:38:23,00:38:24,- It's true.
00:38:24,00:38:25,- Yeah.
00:38:25,00:38:27,"- It's a great quiz, but the host says back me up, Dan."
00:38:27,00:38:30,(all laughing)
00:38:30,00:38:33,(upbeat music)
00:38:33,00:38:37,"- Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,"
00:38:37,00:38:38,and that is my fact.
00:38:38,00:38:40,"My fact this week is that once married,"
00:38:40,00:38:44,some Australian Aboriginals spend the rest of their lives
00:38:44,00:38:47,actively avoiding their mother-in-law.
00:38:47,00:38:51,"- Hey, didn't know I was an Australian Aboriginal, hey."
00:38:51,00:38:53,- I actually think my mother-in-law's brilliant.
00:38:53,00:38:54,(all laughing)
00:38:54,00:38:57,- So this is a thing that's called avoidance speech.
00:38:57,00:38:59,And a lot of native Australians have this
00:38:59,00:39:02,"as part of their culture, where once they're married,"
00:39:02,00:39:04,the idea of talking to their in-laws
00:39:04,00:39:06,"is suddenly something that's seen as taboo,"
00:39:06,00:39:07,and you never do.
00:39:07,00:39:10,And there's quite a few examples of modern-day marriages
00:39:10,00:39:11,where this is still adhered to.
00:39:11,00:39:14,So I was reading a blog by a guy who was saying that
00:39:14,00:39:17,"with his parents-in-laws, he can't hand food directly"
00:39:17,00:39:20,"to them either, as well as not talking to them."
00:39:20,00:39:22,- It must make the egg game very difficult.
00:39:22,00:39:24,(all laughing)
00:39:24,00:39:28,- You can't look at them directly
00:39:28,00:39:30,if he has something that he needs to ask them.
00:39:30,00:39:32,He needs to ask them through the wife.
00:39:32,00:39:34,So she goes and gets their permission
00:39:34,00:39:36,or finds out something for them.
00:39:36,00:39:39,And it's seen as something that's a marker of respect
00:39:39,00:39:40,in these families.
00:39:40,00:39:42,"And the same person who was writing this blog,"
00:39:42,00:39:44,"who did that with his wife, now has that"
00:39:44,00:39:47,with his relationship with his daughter's husband.
00:39:47,00:39:49,And then your language gets changed as well.
00:39:49,00:39:51,So they won't say the name.
00:39:51,00:39:52,They'll say my mother-in-law and father-in-law.
00:39:52,00:39:54,They won't use their actual name.
00:39:54,00:39:56,"And if they're in a room with them and they're watching TV,"
00:39:56,00:39:58,"let's say the son-in-laws in the room,"
00:39:58,00:40:00,he'll face the wall away.
00:40:00,00:40:02,So he's not acknowledging them.
00:40:02,00:40:03,Why are they watching TV?
00:40:03,00:40:06,That's a very anti-social thing to do.
00:40:06,00:40:07,So annoying.
00:40:07,00:40:08,What's happening now?
00:40:08,00:40:10,And what's happening now?
00:40:10,00:40:10,"- No, no, no, please."
00:40:10,00:40:13,"My wife just told me what's happening now, not you."
00:40:13,00:40:14,Why do these taboos exist?
00:40:14,00:40:16,That's what I'm really baffled by.
00:40:16,00:40:18,"- Well, they are around the world, aren't they?"
00:40:18,00:40:20,- It's extraordinary.
00:40:20,00:40:22,"Native America, across Africa, Australian originals,"
00:40:22,00:40:24,"what, and I haven't read an explanation."
00:40:24,00:40:25,- I did read them.
00:40:25,00:40:26,- Which satisfies me.
00:40:26,00:40:28,- It's potentially a respect thing.
00:40:28,00:40:32,It might be a way of preventing any hanky-panky.
00:40:32,00:40:32,- I think it's not.
00:40:32,00:40:34,I think it's gotta be shagging.
00:40:34,00:40:35,- There was a big article I read
00:40:35,00:40:38,"called ""The Mother-in-Law Taboo"" by A.E.M.J. Pans,"
00:40:38,00:40:41,which is one of the main papers on this subject.
00:40:41,00:40:44,And he reckons that basically it's to indicate publicly
00:40:44,00:40:46,that the son-in-law and the mother-in-law
00:40:46,00:40:47,are not having sex with each other.
00:40:47,00:40:49,- But it makes me think they are.
00:40:49,00:40:50,That's the weird thing.
00:40:50,00:40:51,It's always in the office.
00:40:51,00:40:53,It's always the two people who are completely pretending
00:40:53,00:40:54,they don't know each other exist
00:40:54,00:40:56,who turn out to have been having a torrid affair.
00:40:56,00:40:57,- Is it?
00:40:57,00:40:58,- It's exactly what I thought.
00:40:58,00:40:59,And also it will make you fancy them.
00:40:59,00:41:00,The more you're told you're not allowed to speak
00:41:00,00:41:02,"with someone or stick your tongue down their throat,"
00:41:02,00:41:03,"the more you want it, don't you?"
00:41:03,00:41:04,- A bit of fruit.
00:41:04,00:41:05,- Yes.
00:41:05,00:41:08,"Also, why was that bad?"
00:41:08,00:41:10,- Why is it bad to have it with your father-in-law?
00:41:10,00:41:11,Why is it bad?
00:41:11,00:41:13,- So the reason is that it happens more
00:41:13,00:41:16,in matrilineal cultures.
00:41:16,00:41:19,"So, and it's like this taboo, it does happen."
00:41:19,00:41:20,And that's true.
00:41:20,00:41:22,And it tends to be that the women
00:41:22,00:41:24,have very particular roles that they have.
00:41:24,00:41:26,And the idea is that your mother-in-law
00:41:26,00:41:28,is not taking over the job
00:41:28,00:41:30,of what your wife is supposed to do.
00:41:30,00:41:31,- I see.
00:41:31,00:41:32,- So there might be lots of different things
00:41:32,00:41:34,"that a wife is supposed to do in this culture,"
00:41:34,00:41:36,"one of which is sleeping with the husband,"
00:41:36,00:41:37,but they're trying to show
00:41:37,00:41:38,that this definitely isn't happening
00:41:38,00:41:40,and that the generation has moved on
00:41:40,00:41:41,to the next generation.
00:41:41,00:41:42,That's the idea.
00:41:42,00:41:44,"- And I suppose that's the woman,"
00:41:44,00:41:45,other woman that you would see most often.
00:41:45,00:41:47,"So if you were going to shag anyone else,"
00:41:47,00:41:49,it would probably be your wife's mum.
00:41:49,00:41:50,And I think sometimes mother-in-law taboos
00:41:50,00:41:53,also apply to like your mother-in-law's mate.
00:41:53,00:41:55,Sometimes mother-in-law can be a bit of a broader term.
00:41:55,00:41:57,So it can be a few women who are also really close to you.
00:41:57,00:41:59,"- Yeah, we should say these taboos,"
00:41:59,00:42:02,they vary a lot between different groups.
00:42:02,00:42:07,"So in some cases, it's completely avoiding them physically."
00:42:07,00:42:08,"In some, it's using a particular,"
00:42:08,00:42:10,like a different language to address them.
00:42:10,00:42:12,"And in some, it's using a subset of language."
00:42:12,00:42:15,So there's a group called Deer Bell is a language.
00:42:15,00:42:17,And the main language is called Gouel.
00:42:17,00:42:21,And the language for your mother-in-law is Dianghi.
00:42:21,00:42:22,I'm trying to pronounce it wrong.
00:42:22,00:42:25,"But it's like, it's missing particular words"
00:42:25,00:42:28,that might be erotic flash points.
00:42:28,00:42:31,"- Sorry, like what?"
00:42:31,00:42:33,"- Oh loads, erotic flash points."
00:42:33,00:42:34,- Like ankle.
00:42:34,00:42:35,"- I mean, there are loads, are there?"
00:42:35,00:42:38,"Pubic hair, sweaty smell, you know."
00:42:38,00:42:39,You don't want to mention that
00:42:39,00:42:40,in case things just pop off suddenly.
00:42:40,00:42:41,"So yeah, yeah."
00:42:41,00:42:43,- So you're saying you don't say that those words
00:42:43,00:42:44,in front of your mother-in-law either?
00:42:44,00:42:46,- I'd have to have a really good reason
00:42:46,00:42:48,to talk about pubic hair in front of my mother-in-law.
00:42:48,00:42:49,"- Exactly, I think anyone would."
00:42:49,00:42:51,"- But that's the thing, it's not mad taboo"
00:42:51,00:42:52,against sleeping with your mother-in-law.
00:42:52,00:42:54,- I read one thing.
00:42:54,00:42:57,This is by a US historian called Hampton Sides.
00:42:57,00:42:59,And that the reason I'm saying it's by him
00:42:59,00:43:00,is 'cause I don't believe it.
00:43:00,00:43:03,"But he wrote that in the Navajo people,"
00:43:03,00:43:06,husbands are not allowed to look at their mother-in-laws
00:43:06,00:43:08,and it's so important
00:43:08,00:43:11,that the mother-in-laws would wear little bells
00:43:11,00:43:14,on their clothes so that he could hear them coming.
00:43:14,00:43:15,- I think that's true.
00:43:15,00:43:17,- I just can't believe it's true.
00:43:17,00:43:18,"But it was, he's a proper historian."
00:43:18,00:43:19,- I think that's true.
00:43:19,00:43:21,- Like he's a bird and they're the cat.
00:43:21,00:43:22,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:43:22,00:43:24,- I think there was a first-hand account.
00:43:24,00:43:26,And it's similar to the Kaurawai people in West Papua
00:43:26,00:43:28,who shout when they're going round corners
00:43:28,00:43:29,for exactly the same reason.
00:43:29,00:43:31,"The mother-in-law, son-in-law taboo,"
00:43:31,00:43:33,"they'll shout to make clear if a son-in-law's there,"
00:43:33,00:43:36,"go away, and also if the son-in-law's friends"
00:43:36,00:43:38,"see the mum coming, they'll run and find the son"
00:43:38,00:43:39,"and say, ""She's coming, she's coming."""
00:43:39,00:43:40,- That's interesting.
00:43:40,00:43:41,That's like working in a restaurant.
00:43:41,00:43:44,"Whenever you go round the corner, you go corner."
00:43:44,00:43:45,"- Oh, nice."
00:43:45,00:43:46,- So that people coming in the other direction
00:43:46,00:43:47,don't hit you and you drop all the food.
00:43:47,00:43:49,- Is that when you're going in and out of the kitchen
00:43:49,00:43:50,is where you shout something like that?
00:43:50,00:43:52,"- Yeah, at any time, when you're going in a blind corner."
00:43:52,00:43:54,"- Well, and like, did your grandparents"
00:43:54,00:43:55,always used to honk the horn
00:43:55,00:43:56,going around any corner driving?
00:43:56,00:43:57,(laughing)
00:43:57,00:43:58,- No.
00:43:58,00:43:59,- Didn't they?
00:43:59,00:44:00,It's so embarrassing.
00:44:00,00:44:01,"- Oh my God, that time we went to that labyrinth,"
00:44:01,00:44:02,it was a nightmare.
00:44:02,00:44:03,(laughing)
00:44:03,00:44:05,- I used to hate it so much.
00:44:05,00:44:07,"Every corner, gamma honked her horn."
00:44:07,00:44:08,It was just awful.
00:44:08,00:44:11,"Yeah, it was so motivating."
00:44:11,00:44:12,- That's so funny.
00:44:12,00:44:14,- Sometimes I think you have to concentrate really hard
00:44:14,00:44:16,to keep these taboos going.
00:44:16,00:44:21,"So there's one in a similar mother-in-law, son-in-law taboo"
00:44:21,00:44:24,in southwestern Ethiopia.
00:44:24,00:44:27,And it's a practice called Balisha.
00:44:27,00:44:30,And it's basically that married women
00:44:30,00:44:34,"can't speak the name of their husband's mother or father,"
00:44:34,00:44:36,but they also can't speak any word
00:44:36,00:44:38,beginning with the same syllable
00:44:38,00:44:40,of their husband or father's name.
00:44:40,00:44:41,So--
00:44:41,00:44:42,"- So if my mother-in-law was called Pat,"
00:44:42,00:44:45,"I couldn't say, what's the word we can use, Pat?"
00:44:45,00:44:46,- Pat the dog?
00:44:46,00:44:48,"- Yeah, right, I'd have to say, can you stroke the dog?"
00:44:48,00:44:52,- What was the name of that World War II general from America?
00:44:52,00:44:54,(laughing)
00:44:54,00:44:56,- Eisenhower.
00:44:56,00:44:57,- What's the name of that postman?
00:44:57,00:45:00,(laughing)
00:45:00,00:45:01,- That's interesting.
00:45:01,00:45:03,- You'd have to concentrate so much.
00:45:03,00:45:06,"- But apparently in those cultures where that's the case,"
00:45:06,00:45:08,you're taught another language
00:45:08,00:45:10,"so that if you were in that situation,"
00:45:10,00:45:12,"not only will you be able to know what to do,"
00:45:12,00:45:14,but you will say words everyone else will know as well.
00:45:14,00:45:16,"- And some of them, you do have another language, yeah."
00:45:16,00:45:17,"And then some, they're just like,"
00:45:17,00:45:19,"come up with another word, say stroke,"
00:45:19,00:45:20,which isn't the same as passing.
00:45:20,00:45:21,"So, you know."
00:45:21,00:45:22,- Horseman stroke.
00:45:22,00:45:24,(laughing)
00:45:24,00:45:25,- Incest taboos.
00:45:25,00:45:26,"- Oh, yeah."
00:45:26,00:45:29,"- From around the world, including Anglo-Saxon,"
00:45:29,00:45:32,I wanted to see if it existed in this country.
00:45:32,00:45:34,"And according to the penitential of Theodore,"
00:45:34,00:45:36,"which is from the seventh century,"
00:45:36,00:45:39,"if a brother commits fornication with his brother,"
00:45:39,00:45:42,he has to do penance for 15 years.
00:45:42,00:45:45,So that's 15 years without eating meat or drinking wine
00:45:45,00:45:47,if you have sex with your brother.
00:45:47,00:45:48,- Okay.
00:45:48,00:45:49,- Climby.
00:45:49,00:45:50,"- That's a lot, I don't know."
00:45:50,00:45:50,"- That's a lot, that's a lot."
00:45:50,00:45:52,"- It's not worth it, it's not worth it, would you say?"
00:45:52,00:45:54,(laughing)
00:45:54,00:45:55,"- Well, there was a thing in Old England,"
00:45:55,00:45:59,"the swesterosunu, which is where that's your sister's son."
00:45:59,00:45:59,Right?
00:45:59,00:46:01,- So it's a nephew.
00:46:01,00:46:02,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:46:02,00:46:04,But it's specifically with your sister's son
00:46:04,00:46:06,"because your sister's son, your nephew,"
00:46:06,00:46:09,is definitely related to you by blood.
00:46:09,00:46:11,Because you and your sister have both come
00:46:11,00:46:12,"from the same mother,"
00:46:12,00:46:13,so you are definitely related by blood
00:46:13,00:46:15,and she has given birth to her son.
00:46:15,00:46:18,"- Yeah, so even if there was hanky-panky going on"
00:46:18,00:46:20,"in any of these situations, it's still related."
00:46:20,00:46:21,- Right.
00:46:21,00:46:22,"- Like, if my wife has cheated on me,"
00:46:22,00:46:24,"my son might not be my own,"
00:46:24,00:46:27,but my sister's son is definitely related to me by blood.
00:46:27,00:46:29,So that is a sort of rock solid relationship to form.
00:46:29,00:46:31,"- Yeah, that should be where inheritance goes."
00:46:31,00:46:34,I'm surprised that's not where inheritance works more often.
00:46:34,00:46:35,- To the sisters.
00:46:35,00:46:37,"- Yeah, 'cause it's the one you can trust, as you say."
00:46:37,00:46:37,"- Yeah, yeah, you can't trust anyone."
00:46:37,00:46:39,- We should change the rules.
00:46:39,00:46:41,(laughing)
00:46:41,00:46:42,- Mothers in law?
00:46:42,00:46:43,- Yeah.
00:46:43,00:46:45,- I just found some famous mothers in law.
00:46:45,00:46:46,- Okay.
00:46:46,00:46:47,- Would you remember last time we talked about
00:46:47,00:46:48,L. Frank Baum's mother-in-law?
00:46:48,00:46:49,- We did.
00:46:49,00:46:50,- Until the Gage.
00:46:50,00:46:52,So I thought I'd try and find any more notable
00:46:52,00:46:53,mothers-in-law.
00:46:53,00:46:54,- Yeah.
00:46:54,00:46:57,- The mother-in-law of the Marquis de Sade
00:46:57,00:46:59,was really annoyed with him.
00:46:59,00:47:00,"- Oh, is she?"
00:47:00,00:47:01,- Yeah.
00:47:01,00:47:02,"- Well, a lot of people were."
00:47:02,00:47:05,"- Yeah, he ran off to Italy with his wife's younger sister."
00:47:05,00:47:06,- Yeah.
00:47:06,00:47:08,- So she was furious about that.
00:47:08,00:47:10,"Also, she's still her mother-in-law."
00:47:10,00:47:11,She's the same mother-in-law even with him.
00:47:11,00:47:12,- You don't need to explain that.
00:47:12,00:47:13,I think that's--
00:47:13,00:47:14,- I think you do.
00:47:14,00:47:15,Why don't you be flattered?
00:47:15,00:47:17,"It's like, don't fancy one of my daughters."
00:47:17,00:47:18,You fancy both of them.
00:47:18,00:47:19,- Yeah.
00:47:19,00:47:20,"Well, she got him arrested."
00:47:20,00:47:22,She helped the authorities hunt him down.
00:47:22,00:47:23,And he spent most of the rest of his life
00:47:23,00:47:25,in prison or in asylum.
00:47:25,00:47:27,But he had also been committing horrible crimes.
00:47:27,00:47:28,- Yeah.
00:47:28,00:47:31,"Jumping back to the L. Frant Baum very quickly,"
00:47:31,00:47:34,"the Tin Man in the movie, he had a son."
00:47:34,00:47:36,Do you know who his mother-in-law was?
00:47:36,00:47:37,- The Tin Man's wife.
00:47:37,00:47:40,- So the actor who plays the Tin Man has a son.
00:47:40,00:47:42,Who's his mother-in-law in real life?
00:47:42,00:47:44,"- Well, will it be his wife?"
00:47:44,00:47:45,- His wife's mom.
00:47:45,00:47:48,- So he got married to someone who had a notable mother.
00:47:48,00:47:49,Who became his mother-in-law.
00:47:49,00:47:51,- Dan's quiz feels like the least good of all.
00:47:51,00:47:52,This is not guessable.
00:47:52,00:47:53,- It's got the best reveal.
00:47:53,00:47:55,It was Judy Garland.
00:47:55,00:47:59,"Because Dorothy had a daughter, Liza Minnelli."
00:47:59,00:48:02,Liza Minnelli married the Tin Man's son.
00:48:02,00:48:03,- Did not know that that's cool.
00:48:03,00:48:04,- Yeah.
00:48:04,00:48:05,- That is cool.
00:48:05,00:48:06,- There you go.
00:48:06,00:48:07,- That is quite a good quiz where the questions
00:48:07,00:48:09,are completely stupid all over the place.
00:48:09,00:48:11,But the answers are absolutely amazing.
00:48:11,00:48:13,Isn't that what QI is?
