00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,640
 Hi everybody, just before we start the show, we want to say a big hi to

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,720
 new listeners coming to us from BBC Sounds, where the podcast now exists.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:17,080
 Welcome to the fold. We are no such thing as a fish. I'm Anna. I'm here with Dan. Hi Dan. Hello.

4
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,880
 What do we do? Yeah, yeah, so there's four of us. We are QI Elbs.

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,760
 We are the people who are involved in the TV series QI. And if you enjoy that, if you enjoy all the weird facts,

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:34,360
 this is a real kind of concentrated distilled version of it where we just sit around and share the best, most wonderful,

7
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,360
 most odd things that we've discovered over the last seven days.

8
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,880
 Yes, and also if you enjoy the occasional incredibly immature sense of humour on QI,

9
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:49,200
 then you'll get that by the bucket load here. And with a little bit of a warning that there's the occasional bit of adult content.

10
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,760
 So there is swearing, there's the odd adult theme, a little bit of animal sex sometimes makes it in, sometimes a little bit of human

11
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:02,040
 sex facts make it in, but it's all for the purpose of learning weird, interesting, amazing facts.

12
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:08,120
 And you'll notice we've got 10 episodes up there right now on BBC Sounds and from now on every episode will be published there.

13
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:15,760
 That's right. Now we also just want to quickly address the members, the existing listeners of our show and particularly the members of Club Fish.

00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,240
 So enjoy and on with the show on with the show.

26
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:23,040
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

27
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,320
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

28
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,520
 I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Anna Tyshinski and Alex Bell.

29
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:33,240
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

30
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,040
 And in no particular order, here we go.

31
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,960
 Starting with fact number one, that is James.

32
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:46,760
 OK, my fact this week is the artist Goya, who was famously a deaf man, lived in a house called the House of the Deaf Man.

33
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,600
 It was actually named after a different deaf man who lived in that house.

34
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:56,000
 So first of all, what is Goya's full name?

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,280
 Because I think you were practicing.

36
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,960
 Oh, I thought you were calling back something that had happened before.

37
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:06,840
 I was. Yeah, and his full name was Francisco Jose de Goya and Lucien Teff.

38
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,720
 Lovely. Nice. That is a lot less Spanish than I went in the pre-show channel.

39
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,800
 And he is a very famous artist.

40
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:22,120
 He was around in the early 19th century and he's kind of the link between the old masters like Rembrandt and whoever

41
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,160
 and the modern artists because he was doing lots of satires and lots of incredible stuff.

42
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,000
 He is an absolutely incredible artist.

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,640
 He's probably my favorite artist.

44
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,920
 Yeah, I think so. I can actually see why I can connect those two things.

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,160
 Oh, yeah. Yeah, we'll get into it. Some of his dark, disturbed, latter paintings.

46
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,320
 But can you please tell us about this?

47
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,480
 OK, I want to know, did this deaf man name the house after himself, the deaf man?

48
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,240
 No, it was named by locals as that because this deaf man had lived there

49
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,640
 and then later Goya moved in there.

50
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,960
 And did he move in there because he was only looking for houses called House for a Deaf Man?

51
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,480
 Yeah, he actually googled House for a Deaf Man and this is what came up.

52
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,400
 But there was nothing special about the house that made it like accessible for deaf people.

53
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,880
 No, it was a really nice house and he was a former court artist.

54
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:12,520
 So he had money and had a pension from the monarchy and stuff like that.

55
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,680
 It was also sort of a way from the politics.

56
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,720
 He sort of wanted a place to retreat and sort of get away because he was heavily involved.

57
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,400
 His art would often either do satire or make political statements.

58
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,480
 Yeah, exactly. He thought if he hangs around where the Spanish Inquisition are,

59
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,800
 then there's a decent chance he might get, you know, so he wanted to get away.

60
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,680
 But one interesting thing about this building is his most famous work for people at home,

61
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,320
 perhaps, is called Saturn Devouring His Son.

62
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,400
 You might know it.

63
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,840
 It's like a real devilish face and he seems to be biting the head off.

64
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,360
 What could be a chicken or could be his son or something like that?

65
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,200
 It's a really sort of dark painting.

66
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,600
 It's harrowing. It's like really quite scary.

67
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,880
 Yeah, if you Google it, you'll probably recognize it from memes and stuff.

68
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,960
 But that was.

69
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,160
 But it was on his wall in this house and actually he painted a load of these

70
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,720
 kind of satirical paintings on the wall of his house.

71
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,200
 And actually they ended up being chipped off because he didn't intend to sell them

72
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,080
 or anything. They were just murals in his house.

73
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,120
 They're known as the black paintings now. Precisely.

74
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,400
 He have a whole his whole first period of his life was much more involved in politics,

75
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,160
 like you say, painting on commission for royal courts.

76
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,240
 And there was an awful lot more like of a positive vibe to his painting.

77
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,400
 And then he got really sick and he went deaf as a result of one of his illnesses.

78
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,240
 And then he became very like depressed and obsessed with illness

79
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,240
 and obsessed with like death and kind of neurotic.

80
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,200
 And these paintings, we think, reflect this dark state that he was in.

81
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,240
 Yeah, they're all really weird and mysterious as well.

82
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,720
 We don't actually know that the painting is called Saturn devouring itself.

83
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,480
 We don't know anything about. We don't think about them.

84
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,960
 Yeah, because like you say, they were all painted on the walls.

85
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,360
 And then the wallpaper had to kind of be chipped away from the wall

86
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,840
 and then put onto canvas.

87
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,760
 But like a lot of art historians think that like they had to be very

88
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,200
 significantly altered when that happened.

89
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,840
 Yeah, definitely restoration.

90
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,480
 Yeah, you can spot little bits of it that really they think again,

91
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,320
 it's almost theory. Is that damage or is that what he intended?

92
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,000
 There's one called the dog.

93
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,480
 It's basically a landscape where you see a dog's head sticking up

94
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,480
 at the bottom of the painting.

95
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,200
 And, you know, is he coming over a sort of horizon?

96
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,000
 Is he coming over a bump in a hill? Is he drowning in quicksand?

97
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,360
 A lot of people say he's drowning.

98
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,480
 I looked at him and thought, oh, it's like it's like kind of begging.

99
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,800
 Like you get a dog at a table begging,

100
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,320
 but a lot of people have attempted drowning.

101
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,200
 Yeah, but we have no idea, right? He's never intended anyone to see these.

102
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,120
 These were private kind of things that he did on his wall at home.

103
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,840
 You know, if a kid drills in the wall, they get in trouble, don't they?

104
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,040
 And yeah, kind of example is that setting.

105
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,840
 You've got to own your own house in order to then make those decisions, right?

106
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,440
 That's got to imagine if he was renting how pissed off they were.

107
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,520
 You'll not get your deposit back.

108
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,920
 Yeah, so he gave it he gave the house to his grandson

109
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,040
 and then his grandson sold it to, I don't know, a baron.

110
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,320
 And and then that's the guy who went, let's let's take this off,

111
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,640
 put this on canvas, donate it to the museums.

112
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,400
 The dog in particular in the museum where it is,

113
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,960
 the curator of that museum says that there's not a single contemporary painter

114
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,480
 in the world who does not pray in front of the dog.

115
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,600
 It's that important. Oh, yeah.

116
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,560
 I've got to say, the dog doesn't impress me as the guy.

117
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,360
 I like I think some of the others are better.

118
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,000
 Really is a big dog doesn't put anything out.

119
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,960
 It's like, it's a massive portrait shaped vertical painting.

120
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,080
 The dog's right in the bottom and most of it's just brown.

121
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,000
 Like 95 percent of it is just brown.

122
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,800
 Once you learn about Maljevic, by the way, who's painting is just black.

123
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,440
 It's like literally just a black square.

124
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,440
 Right. Yeah, if you don't like something that's 90 percent brown,

125
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,960
 you're not going to like that.

126
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,560
 I think the only reason people like the dogs

127
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,200
 is because you've filed through these like witches and decapitated,

128
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,600
 bloodied people tear each other to shreds and then you've got a little black dog.

129
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,560
 People love animals.

130
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,400
 Yeah, people love animals.

131
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,520
 He knew the tick tock generation was coming up.

132
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,200
 He knew memes were on the way.

133
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,200
 He's so clever. It's actually doge, isn't it?

134
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,080
 So there's so much written about his art

135
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,880
 and the interpretations of it, but what do we know about Goya the man?

136
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,720
 Here's a few things that we know.

137
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,200
 Are you presenting a documentary?

138
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,200
 I thought you were on the South Bank show for a second.

139
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,400
 It really felt like I was Melvin Bragg all of a sudden.

140
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,160
 The smell of orange. Love the smell of orange.

141
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,680
 Oh, yeah. Yeah.

142
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,400
 The smell of a girl's armpit loved it as long as it had an orange.

143
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,880
 You get this like a dating profile, right?

144
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,880
 Well, this is the whiff of tobacco, the aftertaste of wine

145
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,840
 and the twanging rhythms of a street dance.

146
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,600
 This is all according to a biography that was written about him.

147
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,320
 Is it according to him himself?

148
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,200
 Because it feels like, OK, he wrote this down somewhere.

149
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,440
 It wasn't someone going, he seems like the kind of guy

150
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,320
 who loves sniffing girls armpits.

151
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,720
 Let's put that in. Yeah, I love the smell of an orange.

152
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,320
 Like, who doesn't like orange is generally pleasant.

153
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,760
 Why would you like note that down?

154
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,440
 Well, maybe he chucked the orange thing in there

155
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,200
 to make up for the weirdness of the girls armpits so that there was.

156
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,520
 Yeah, I'm not totally crazy.

157
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,280
 I like normal things, too.

158
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:49,000
 He was the first major artist to paint a woman entirely nude

159
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,040
 in a profane style, as in the this was the one

160
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,840
 that he got summoned by the inquisition.

161
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,560
 Yeah, so profane means not religious.

162
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,000
 And this was the naked maca.

163
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,560
 Yes, it was deemed, I think, indecent

164
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,320
 and prejudicial to the common good.

165
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,760
 So, yeah, and I didn't know what a maca was,

166
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,720
 but machos and machas were according to the New Yorker.

167
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,720
 This is how New Yorker described them flamboyantly cheeky, lower class dandies.

168
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,960
 And that's what I've got on my dating profile.

169
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:21,720
 Lower class, please, the other way you talk, Alex.

170
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,360
 But yeah, I got summoned by the inquisition

171
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,200
 and I just find his tangles with the inquisition quite bizarre.

172
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,240
 Yeah, so weird.

173
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,080
 Well, who knew the inquisition was still bloody

174
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,840
 happening the start of the 19th century?

175
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,360
 Are they lasted for ages, didn't they?

176
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,880
 It lasted ridiculously long.

177
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,920
 It's practically going since late medieval times.

178
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,840
 And still they're struggling on clinging on.

179
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,720
 I think they were quite toothless by then.

180
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,120
 Python sketch was topical.

181
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,200
 Yeah, but he did.

182
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,280
 He got away with it with the naked painting.

183
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,680
 I believe by saying, well, if you think this was gross,

184
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,040
 then you're condemning your former king because he said

185
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,440
 he was emulating a Velasquez painting

186
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,640
 and that Philip the Fourth of Spain had loved.

187
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:02,200
 So he was going, well, your king loved this, basically, your dead king.

188
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,400
 So what are you going to do?

189
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,400
 Well, the interesting thing I think about the naked

190
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,240
 maha is that he gave it or sold it, I should say, to Godoy,

191
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,440
 who was the prime minister of Spain at the time.

192
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,480
 And the story goes that we know that Goya made two versions,

193
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,840
 the naked maha and the not-naked maha, the clothed maha,

194
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,600
 you might call it.

195
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,160
 And the prime minister supposedly kept the clothed one on display.

196
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,400
 And whenever his friends would come round after a few whiskeys,

197
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,040
 he would say, look at this, and he would pull like a secret lever

198
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,320
 and the wall would spin round and the naked one would come out.

199
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,520
 That's like one of those pens where you turn it upside down.

200
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,320
 It's actually so tacky.

201
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,120
 Well, that's the story, and that's supposedly what happened.

202
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,640
 But for sure, the reason that he got brought in front of the Inquisition,

203
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,520
 Goya is because Godoy was actually really controversial,

204
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,800
 because he was the prime minister.

205
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,240
 And this was one of the really controversial things that he did,

206
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,200
 having this terrible painting.

207
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,040
 And it was Goya kind of got pulled into the Inquisition

208
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,640
 because they were going after Godoy.

209
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,280
 Really? That's amazing.

210
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,360
 It's a painting that has caused controversy for not just his period,

211
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,920
 but well long after his death.

212
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,480
 The 155 years well long. Well long, man.

213
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,560
 Bare long. He used to say people used to go to Godoy's house and go,

214
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,840
 that is a bad good painting. Do you think this is bad good?

215
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:28,680
 So many, many years later, it's issued in Spain as a stamp.

216
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,560
 And this is suddenly the first stamp where there's a naked woman on a stamp.

217
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,400
 And in American, this is 1959, they banned it.

218
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,880
 So any letters that came into America, they said, we will not forward them on.

219
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,200
 There are a few cases where at the post office, they would actually just,

220
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,760
 you know, they'd scrawled up the stamp, scrawled it over and stuff like that

221
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,320
 and then send it on. But it was a huge, huge problem.

222
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,080
 That's amazing. Yeah, the letters returned because of, yeah.

223
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,280
 It's a time magazine wrote, an indecent picture is bad enough,

224
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,040
 but a postage stamp whose backside must be licked.

225
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,400
 Millions of millions of innocent children collect stamps.

226
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,920
 And so, yeah, and there were certain places that kind of allowed it.

227
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,400
 But eventually they did ban it entirely.

228
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,040
 It didn't have a picture of her bum on the back that you could lick, did it?

229
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,240
 No.

230
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,800
 So we don't know who the woman is in that painting,

231
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:18,160
 but there's a pretty good chance that it's at least partly based on the duchess

232
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,680
 of Alba, who was supposedly Gaius Mistras.

233
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,200
 They were definitely very good friends.

234
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,720
 We're not sure if they were.

235
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,720
 But they were definitely good mates.

236
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,080
 That sounded like an event.

237
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,560
 They looked after a small bird together.

238
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,920
 That sounded like an actual censor on our show that you said a swear word.

239
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,560
 And it's now been whistled over.

240
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,960
 I thought now that we're possibly going on BBC Sounds, that I should not be saying fucking.

241
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,400
 Yeah, true.

242
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,200
 Anyway, the duchess of Alba's full name, actually,

243
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:53,560
 was Donia Maria Dalpila Tareza, Caetana de Silva, Alvarez de Toledo

244
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:58,040
 and Silva Bazan, Decimo Tercera Duchesa de Alba de Tomes,

245
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:03,080
 Decimo Premiera Duchesa de Hosca, Sexta Duchesa de Montero,

246
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:08,800
 Octava Candesa Duchesa de Alvarez, Decimo Premiera Marquiza del Capio,

247
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,120
 Decimo Tercera Marquiza de Coria, Noneba Novena, I won't do them all.

248
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,240
 It's 754 letters in total.

249
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,600
 Her full name was.

250
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,480
 Either we have to say this fact or we have to say all the other factors.

251
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:28,200
 So, yeah, and her descendant, who died in 2014,

252
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,400
 who was actually a quite famous duchess of Alba, the one who was in the painting

253
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,320
 was a 13th and the one who died in 2014 was in the Guinness World Records

254
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,080
 as the aristocrat with most titles.

255
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,640
 She was a bit of an eccentric.

256
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:44,640
 Yeah, and the duchess of Alba, who's in the painting.

257
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,680
 There's interesting thing about her is she was one of the most powerful people

258
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,280
 because she was also supposedly the mistress of Godoy, the prime minister.

259
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,320
 But she had a bit of a beef with Maria Louisa,

260
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,400
 who was the queen consort who was married to Charles IV.

261
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,320
 These were the two most powerful women

262
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,480
 and they really, really hated each other.

263
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,040
 And one day the queen consort was going to go to a party

264
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,440
 and the duchess of Alba found out what she was going to wear

265
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,080
 and got all of her maids to wear exactly the same clothes as the Countess

266
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,520
 and go to the party.

267
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,160
 So suddenly there were like 20 women all wearing exactly the same clothes.

268
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,040
 That could be seen as flattery.

269
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,000
 It wasn't. It was seen as famously women.

270
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,800
 Hey, that it was seen as a massive, massive slap.

271
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,120
 Do they women you say they don't like that?

272
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,840
 It was seen as a massive, massive slam, so much so that we think

273
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,640
 that the queen consort had the duchess of Alba murdered for that.

274
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,280
 Oh, wow. Wow.

275
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,000
 For getting her maids to wear the same clothes.

276
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,320
 That is a magical joke on wrong.

277
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,400
 Yeah. So I'm now terrified because sometimes me and Anne come

278
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,000
 into the office wearing the same jumper with a cuddly animal featured on the front.

279
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,440
 Yeah. Do you think she's plotting my demise?

280
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,920
 I feel like she might be.

281
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,200
 Actually, they exhumed her body in 1945.

282
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,200
 They think she probably died.

283
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,200
 Yeah.

284
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,160
 She probably died of meningitis, we think, after being murdered.

285
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,120
 But that was the story for hundreds of years.

286
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,600
 That's what happened. That's amazing.

287
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,720
 The number of paintings by Goya is going down and down by the day.

288
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,960
 Right. It's a real.

289
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,960
 I'd be more surprised if it was going up.

290
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:20,360
 I suppose sometimes you find paint.

291
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,520
 No, that is true.

292
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,240
 You do just got the lost paintings.

293
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,200
 You might have had another like a shed or something

294
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,920
 that he painted all over that we haven't discovered yet.

295
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,440
 Absolutely.

296
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,800
 You might have had a second home that he rented out as an Airbnb,

297
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,280
 but then it turns out that it had paintings on it.

298
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,000
 Yeah. But none of these things are true.

299
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,920
 That's what we're saying.

300
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,000
 Well, I think what we're saying is we don't know.

301
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,880
 We just don't know.

302
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,160
 If you're staying in an Airbnb with disturbing paintings on the wall,

303
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,840
 get in touch. That's about every Airbnb.

304
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,680
 We haven't stayed in like a tastefully decorated Airbnb.

305
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,080
 You need to up your budget very slightly at least.

306
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,080
 It's a lower class Gabby.

307
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:56,440
 So this is because basically lots of paintings

308
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,920
 that we thought were by him turn out not to be by him.

309
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,400
 Oh, really?

310
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,800
 And when, you know, modern analysis is done,

311
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,800
 it looks very closely at brushstrokes

312
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,760
 and the type of materials that we used

313
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,200
 and they make certain deductions.

314
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,400
 I'm always skeptical, you know.

315
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,360
 So there's actually one of his most famous paintings, Colossus.

316
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,880
 They now think was not painted by him.

317
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,680
 And there's one expert called Manuela Mena.

318
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,360
 And she says that the brushstrokes are inferior

319
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,600
 to what he would have done.

320
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,200
 You can tell that the confidence with which they were made

321
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,120
 is not an expert.

322
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,240
 And you think he could just be having a bad day?

323
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,040
 Can I just say, if people in the like 200 years,

324
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,200
 they listened to episode 183 of the podcast,

325
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,680
 they weren't very funny in that one.

326
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,280
 So I don't think it was them.

327
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,080
 That's that AI thing jumping over their voices.

328
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:47,480
 OK, it is time for fact number two.

329
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,640
 And that is my fact.

330
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,720
 My fact this week is that before governments

331
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,360
 experienced cyber attacks,

332
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,200
 they had to deal with fax attacks.

333
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,920
 Oh, what a great name.

334
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,160
 Alternative podcast.

335
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:58,840
 Fax attack.

336
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,600
 Fax attack.

337
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,480
 Oh, yeah, that's true, yeah.

338
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,840
 So this is a thing that's called a black fax.

339
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,360
 And people would do this as pranks,

340
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,560
 but they would do it to companies that they hated.

341
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,880
 They would do it to governments

342
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,760
 where they would basically send over black paper from their side.

343
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,880
 And often they would do, they would loop it around.

344
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,160
 So their fax machine was just sort of eternally

345
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,960
 sending a fully black page.

346
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,680
 Like a conveyor belt.

347
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,120
 Like a conveyor belt, exactly.

348
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,760
 And so the people receiving it,

349
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,480
 if they were not near their fax machine,

350
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,040
 suddenly they would be using all the ink up

351
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,160
 or they might even heat the machine up so much

352
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,760
 because so much of it was processing the load ages.

353
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,760
 It would overload and it would sort of just.

354
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,920
 I suppose also means you can't use the fax

355
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,280
 while that's happening. Exactly.

356
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,880
 We should say, because people will write in,

357
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,360
 probably not ink so much as thermal paper.

358
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,520
 Yes, sorry, yes.

359
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,320
 But I love already the people who would have written in

360
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,280
 to complain about that.

361
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,720
 I'm sorry we corrected ourselves

362
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,000
 because I want to know you better.

363
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,400
 Send your faxes to podcast@qi.com.

364
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,320
 So yeah, it's a method that was done

365
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,920
 and it was done, you know, before cybercrime.

366
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,880
 If we're being sort of talking about it loosely

367
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,360
 because there are always examples of like the 1700s,

368
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,360
 a version of cyber attack.

369
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,600
 Yeah, they say the first one was like 1834,

370
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,680
 it was supposed to be the first cyber crime.

371
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,520
 What was that then?

372
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,000
 Well, it was in France

373
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,880
 and it was obviously before the internet was invented

374
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,280
 and it was a way of, sorry.

375
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,040
 Because these days, they might not know.

376
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:27,360
 In those days, financial market data was,

377
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,400
 like trading was happening,

378
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,680
 but it was sort of done via like letter.

379
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,400
 So if you were in a different town,

380
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,480
 like the information would travel quite slowly

381
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,600
 and people were always trying to find a way

382
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,440
 to beat that information

383
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,840
 and people tried like carrier pigeons

384
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,080
 and all sorts of stuff like this.

385
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,480
 But one way it wasn't communicated

386
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,320
 was the telegraph system,

387
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,080
 which was used for other things.

388
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,040
 But these two brothers, the Blanc brothers,

389
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:49,240
 they set up a ruse with some of the telegraph

390
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,680
 operators where they smuggled

391
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,040
 little information indicators in other messages.

392
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,960
 But the way the hack worked was that

393
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,760
 the information would be like a single character,

394
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,800
 like I suppose U for up or D for down

395
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,640
 or something like that

396
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,560
 to indicate something to do with the stock market.

397
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,560
 But then if you followed that

398
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,680
 with a backspace character,

399
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,120
 it meant that it wouldn't get written down

400
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,840
 'cause it would be regarded as a mistake.

401
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,760
 But the telegraph operator would see it all.

402
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,720
 So if they were in on it,

403
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,080
 they could write down and be like,

404
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,440
 "Yeah, it's sent over as a mistake,

405
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,280
 we're not writing it down,

406
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,120
 but this is the information."

407
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,000
 And the idea being that you know

408
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,280
 if the price of gold has gone down

409
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,800
 you could sell it for anyone else.

410
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,640
 - Yeah, exactly.

411
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,480
 Yeah, yeah.

412
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,320
 - That's clever.

413
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,480
 Do you think, obviously,

414
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,960
 who was the modern artist we mentioned earlier?

415
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,640
 Was it Roscoe who did all the black paintings?

416
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,480
 - Oh, Maljevic.

417
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,800
 - There's Maljevic.

418
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,440
 All good when he tries to fax the photos

419
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,640
 of his new artworks crew.

420
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,160
 I keep trying to send it to you.

421
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,000
 What?

422
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,560
 Stop pranking us.

423
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,400
 - It's twice worth so much,

424
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,720
 it's just the ink.

425
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,080
 - No, it's not black.

426
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,480
 It's the Duchess of Alba's name

427
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,640
 in very small fonts.

428
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,200
 (all laughing)

429
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,080
 - Do you know who, as of 2017,

430
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,160
 so I don't know if it's changed,

431
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,040
 but the last report that I saw, 2017,

432
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:55,440
 was the biggest purchasers of fax machines in the UK.

433
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,280
 - NHS.

434
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,120
 - NHS.

435
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:57,960
 - It's the NHS.

436
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,800
 - Yeah.

437
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,920
 - Yeah, so interesting.

438
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,440
 - They've really phased it out since then.

439
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,280
 I think, haven't they?

440
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,600
 There was a big scandal a couple of years ago.

441
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,440
 - Yeah, it was controversial, I remember.

442
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,680
 - They were like, "We've got to stop."

443
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,520
 - Yeah.

444
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,360
 (all laughing)

445
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,480
 - Yeah, and pages as well, wasn't it?

446
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,320
 - Yeah.

447
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,440
 - I think they decided they wanted to get rid of them all.

448
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,680
 - Also, the NHS still have a big dictaphone tradition,

449
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,280
 where a lot of the older doctors still,

450
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,280
 instead of--

451
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,640
 - Why don't they just use their fingers?

452
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,220
 (all laughing)

453
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,320
 - That's one of my favorite jokes.

454
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,280
 - It's really a joke, it's a great joke.

455
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,120
 It's great.

456
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,240
 - Sorry, as you were saying.

457
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,000
 - No, just that loads of doctors still

458
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,960
 will be able to log in to the usual NHS account,

459
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,800
 and when you go to the doctor,

460
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,640
 they'll make your medical notes

461
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,360
 and just put them into the system.

462
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,520
 A lot of older doctors still prefer to use dictaphones,

463
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,040
 i.e. manual dictaphones with actual tape cassette tapes

464
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,240
 inside, dictate the notes,

465
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,520
 and then they're sent away

466
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,080
 to a third-party transcription service,

467
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,160
 and then the notes are sent back,

468
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,120
 and then the doctors then check them,

469
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,040
 like the written notes,

470
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,160
 and then they're inputted to the system

471
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,000
 by someone else,

472
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,560
 and it's an insanely inefficient system.

473
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,200
 - You've got to feel bad about that,

474
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,400
 surely, doctors. - Yeah, it's ridiculous.

475
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,280
 - Miley Cyrus uses fax machines.

476
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,120
 - Okay.

477
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,360
 - Is this-- - What for?

478
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,200
 - For communicating?

479
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,400
 - Everything, really.

480
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,400
 - No, only with one person.

481
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,720
 She uses them to communicate with her godmother,

482
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,800
 Dolly Parton, because Dolly Parton

483
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,480
 actually does use them for everything.

484
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,320
 - Why?

485
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,520
 - She refuses to use text messaging,

486
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,800
 and instead uses a fax machine for everything.

487
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,640
 - Really? - Yeah.

488
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,480
 - You really buried the lead there,

489
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,880
 but you were trying to get the kids in by saying,

490
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,480
 "Miley Cyrus uses sometimes his fax machine

491
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,680
 "for Dolly Parton, that's amazing."

492
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,800
 - Yeah, Dolly said,

493
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,200
 "I don't want to talk to everyone

494
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,720
 "that wants to talk to me.

495
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,720
 "I don't text 'cause I don't want to have to answer."

496
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,120
 So she thinks if people text her,

497
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,360
 she'd have to reply all the time,

498
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,320
 but with a fax machine,

499
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,120
 she can just, like, get the messages and then--

500
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,360
 - Yeah, it's very indirect.

501
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,200
 You can't do the three dots thing,

502
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,760
 or you don't get seen on a fax.

503
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,560
 - Yeah, but then it's still indirect this way,

504
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:47,240
 because Miley Cyrus says that she doesn't really fax.

505
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,480
 She has a phone.

506
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,520
 What happens is Dolly Parton sends a fax,

507
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,720
 then somebody at the other end scans the fax

508
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,640
 to see what it says,

509
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,280
 and then writes it in a text message

510
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,840
 that gets sent to Miley Cyrus.

511
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,680
 - Actually, the real leader of this fax

512
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,120
 is that somebody's job is sorting communications

513
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,360
 between Miley Cyrus and Dolly Parton exclusively.

514
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,040
 - Are you telling me you don't want that job?

515
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,800
 - Of course I want that job.

516
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,720
 - It must happen a lot.

517
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,280
 I mentioned years ago on the podcast

518
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,840
 that's how Brian Blessed would do his tweets.

519
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,520
 So, yeah, it's the exact same thing.

520
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,840
 He would be sent the tweets to reply to, to his agent,

521
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,440
 fax it to him, he would fax back.

522
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,600
 Like, there was a whole fax system.

523
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,480
 - Did he write out the replies by hand,

524
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,560
 which would then fax back,

525
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,400
 and then there would be times--

526
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,240
 - I can't remember now, yeah.

527
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,320
 - It went through, like, eight different modes

528
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,160
 of communication.

529
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,160
 - There was a lot, but maybe that's more,

530
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,160
 it can't just be Dolly and Brian Blessed.

531
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,400
 - Brian Blessed once tweet Miley Cyrus saying,

532
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,960
 "Can you tell Dolly Parton to answer her phone?"

533
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,840
 - I think it all had to go through the NHS in the end,

534
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,160
 that was where you were.

535
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,960
 - Have you heard of the fax number of the beast?

536
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,880
 - Okay, six, six, six, something.

537
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,680
 - It's six, six, seven.

538
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,640
 And it's quite just a little nice nugget

539
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,760
 for phone numbers of faxes.

540
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,960
 - Oh, 'cause of course your fax number used to be

541
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,240
 your phone number, but with one digit at the end,

542
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,080
 gone one up.

543
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,560
 - Yeah, exactly.

544
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,400
 Yeah, yeah.

545
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,520
 So, six, six, seven is the fax number of the beast.

546
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,360
 - Oh, I see.

547
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,880
 - I'm sorry, according to people who--

548
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,720
 - I think it's a joke, right?

549
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,560
 It's a little joke.

550
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,400
 - It's a joke.

551
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,240
 - Yeah, yeah, it's a joke, yeah.

552
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,080
 - Yeah, no, nice.

553
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:11,920
 I like, sorry.

554
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,760
 (laughing)

555
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,080
 I like jokes.

556
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,480
 I'm the joke guy.

557
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:21,360
 - Before we had cyber, let's say urban legends

558
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,200
 being sent through email and Facebook and stuff like that,

559
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,600
 they were all done on fax machines.

560
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,320
 And in 1993, there was a big scare in Memphis, Tennessee

561
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,880
 because there was a load of faxes going around

562
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,520
 about gangs would drive around with the lights off

563
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,960
 in the cars, and if anyone flashed them to tell them

564
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,840
 their lights were off, then they would chase them,

565
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,400
 stop them, and kill them.

566
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,240
 And obviously--

567
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,080
 - Oh my God, was this not true?

568
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,900
 'Cause I heard this rumor quite recently.

569
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,640
 - It's just got to Anna's fax.

570
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,640
 - I mean, that still goes around that rumor, right?

571
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,160
 But no, it is fake.

572
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,160
 - But it was called fax law,

573
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,760
 the culture of sending faxes around,

574
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,520
 and it was the old meme culture, I think.

575
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,360
 - Yeah, exactly.

576
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,520
 And when emails came along,

577
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,120
 it just went from fax to email directly from there to there.

578
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,200
 - So, fax law was the name for the rumors,

579
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,040
 the lies that were started.

580
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,200
 - Yeah, like folklore.

581
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,040
 - Oh wow.

582
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:08,880
 - I thank you.

583
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,000
 Again, I now get that that's a joke, fax law,

584
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,840
 to play on words.

585
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,840
 - She likes jokes.

586
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,680
 - She loves jokes.

587
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,520
 - Ladies and gentlemen.

588
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,840
 - I'm a joke, aren't I?

589
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,920
 - Oh, the last time I came on this podcast.

590
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:23,840
 - Do you know who else used to fax each other

591
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,680
 in the '80s?

592
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,520
 Well, loads of people.

593
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,360
 - Give us a list.

594
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,680
 - I'll give you a list.

595
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,280
 - I framed that question badly.

596
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,160
 I've got a better way of framing it.

597
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,120
 What was the, and pretend that,

598
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,240
 I didn't ask that previous question,

599
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,600
 'cause otherwise it'll give it away,

600
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,240
 what was the hotline between the White House

601
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,640
 and the Kremlin?

602
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,120
 - Was it a fax machine?

603
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,520
 - Dunno, I know you cheated there.

604
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,680
 Probably using previous information.

605
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,600
 - I always thought it was a red telephone.

606
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,800
 - It wasn't, a phone.

607
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,360
 - That's Batman you're thinking of.

608
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:55,080
 - I think that was part of where the rumor came from

609
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,080
 that the hotline was a phone,

610
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,240
 'cause I think it was in one of the Batman films

611
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,000
 who speaks to the White House on the phone.

612
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,520
 Anyway, the hotline between the White House

613
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,080
 and the Kremlin famously started by Kennedy

614
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,320
 and Khrushchev in the '60s,

615
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,680
 was never a telephone between them,

616
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,040
 but it was in the '80s a fax machine.

617
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,080
 So it started with type, so it was teletype,

618
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,040
 so it was basically like an old version of text

619
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,840
 where you'd type a message if you're in the White House

620
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,600
 or in fact in the Pentagon where it was.

621
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,680
 You'd type a message, it would be encrypted by people,

622
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,280
 sent to the Kremlin and then translated

623
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,200
 by someone at the other end into Russian.

624
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,880
 And it was quite sweet.

625
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,040
 The start of the Cold War,

626
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,120
 they swapped machines for this teletyping.

627
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,480
 So the Kremlin posted to the US

628
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,480
 four of their teletype machines

629
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,080
 that could print stuff out in Cyrillic,

630
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,960
 and the US posted back to the Kremlin

631
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,200
 four of their machines.

632
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,040
 And they upgraded to fax machines in the '80s.

633
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,240
 So in the 1980s, if there was an emergency

634
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,280
 between Reagan and Gorbachev,

635
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,320
 then they faxed each other.

636
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,520
 - There's many ways that people have to protect themselves

637
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,600
 against cyber attacks these days.

638
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,320
 What do you reckon, this is now turning just into a quiz,

639
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,720
 the answer is not fax machine.

640
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,920
 (laughing)

641
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:04,200
 What do you reckon, so like for the Navy,

642
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,120
 how they get by if they get cyber attacked

643
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,800
 for let's say their GPS system is hit with malware

644
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,720
 from an unknown enemy and that's how they're scrambled.

645
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,560
 - Okay, so you need to know which way to go,

646
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,200
 but your GPS is broken 'cause you've been hit by cyber.

647
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,880
 - Yep, you pop up and look at the stars in your periscope.

648
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,720
 - That's what it is.

649
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,560
 - Oh shit, sorry.

650
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,080
 - Celestial navigation.

651
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,120
 They're all taught celestial navigation, yeah.

652
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,920
 - I'd make such a great submarine captain

653
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,440
 'cause that was my first thought and I was like,

654
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,560
 I mean, I wouldn't know how to do it, but like.

655
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,600
 - Someone used to celestially navigate, thanks Alex.

656
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,960
 - That's why the captain's there.

657
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,800
 - There's no such captain, I'm in charge,

658
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,640
 I'm not actually doing anything,

659
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,480
 I'm just telling you what to do, right Anna?

660
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,920
 But like, think about how quickly

661
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,040
 I made that decision and who's right what.

662
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,040
 - Uh, go on.

663
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,120
 - No, no, it wasn't funny.

664
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,920
 - Oh, as she knows funny.

665
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,180
 (laughing)

666
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:55,280
 - So, we mentioned the number of the beast earlier on.

667
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,120
 - Yes.

668
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:56,960
 - I've got a little quiz for you.

669
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,800
 - Oh, great.

670
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,920
 - Are the following things,

671
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,480
 are the names of cyber attacks

672
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,140
 or the names of bands who have opened for Iron Maiden?

673
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,160
 (laughing)

674
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,760
 Let's go for Shady Rat.

675
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,680
 - Shady Rat's a band surely.

676
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,520
 - Yeah, cyber attack.

677
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,360
 - I'm gonna go cyber attack.

678
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,400
 - It's a cyber attack.

679
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,240
 - Wow.

680
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,040
 - In fact, it was a series of cyber attacks

681
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,280
 in the late 2000s, originated from China.

682
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,720
 Night Dragon.

683
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,560
 - Cyber attack.

684
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,960
 - Band, cyber attack.

685
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,480
 - Oh, Dan, you suck at this so badly.

686
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,720
 (laughing)

687
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,360
 Around the same time as Shady Rat,

688
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,160
 these were attacks on energy companies.

689
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,680
 Nitro's use.

690
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,640
 - Cyber attack.

691
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,720
 - I'm gonna go band this time.

692
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,540
 - Band.

693
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,380
 - Cyber attack.

694
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,720
 (laughing)

695
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,040
 - I don't know how my brain works.

696
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,560
 - Everyone knows Iron Maiden have a policy

697
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,080
 of never having a supporting act.

698
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,840
 (laughing)

699
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,480
 - These were attacks on Iran by the US

700
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,800
 that were planned if nuclear talks failed.

701
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:54,300
 Let's go for Vinnie Vincent's invasion.

702
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,880
 (laughing)

703
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,800
 - I'm gonna say it's a band.

704
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,640
 Surely it's a band.

705
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,480
 - Yeah.

706
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,320
 - That.

707
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,160
 - Band.

708
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,000
 (laughing)

709
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,320
 - I am gonna say cyber attack.

710
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,600
 - Oh, I know you've lost it.

711
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,880
 (cheering)

712
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,440
 - I actually run out of cyber attacks now.

713
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,600
 I did the ball at the top.

714
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,960
 (laughing)

715
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,240
 - I was looking at other like kind of non-digital ways

716
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,360
 of hacking things.

717
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,220
 And did you, have you heard of token suckers?

718
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,200
 So this was for many years,

719
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,920
 the New York subway ran on tokens.

720
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,080
 It was, you would buy tokens which would go into the slots

721
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:23,920
 to let you through the barriers.

722
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,440
 And it was because I think the denominations

723
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,840
 of coins never always matched up with the fares.

724
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,480
 And there were people called token suckers

725
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,520
 who would steal tokens by jamming up the slots

726
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,700
 in the machine with a bit of paper

727
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,240
 so that when people put their token in,

728
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,800
 they'd lose it, but it wouldn't go all the way in.

729
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,640
 And then they would come back and they would

730
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,720
 just crash down and suck the token out.

731
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,560
 - With their mouth.

732
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,400
 - With their mouth.

733
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,240
 - Really?

734
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,080
 - Yeah.

735
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:44,920
 - It's a hell of a vacuum you've got on your mouth

736
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,000
 if you can suck a coin out of a slot.

737
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,360
 - Yeah, I think if it's just inside,

738
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,100
 you can kind of try and get it.

739
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,720
 - Maybe use your tongue to just soft wiggle it.

740
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,540
 - Yeah.

741
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,680
 - You could take a hoover,

742
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,240
 you could take a vacuum cleaner to the station.

743
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,080
 - Like a dice.

744
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:56,900
 - A little more suspicious, but yeah.

745
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,740
 - I think you've had a tax attention.

746
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,840
 But they used to, some of the subway station attendants

747
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,800
 would put chili powder in the slots as a deterrent,

748
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,640
 which is nice.

749
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,720
 - Yeah, that's nice.

750
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,040
 - You could get half a tennis ball and stick it on

751
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,160
 and then wham it and that creates a vacuum

752
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,520
 and then when you pull it off, it would suck it.

753
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,360
 - Really?

754
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,200
 - Yeah.

755
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,020
 - That's good.

756
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:13,840
 - Or play at any plunger, I guess.

757
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,000
 - Plunger would do the same job.

758
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,320
 (laughing)

759
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,160
 - That was made twice, yeah?

760
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,740
 (upbeat music)

761
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:23,900
 (upbeat music)

762
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,220
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

763
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,940
 and that is Anna.

764
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,740
 - My fact this week is that for 200 years,

765
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:34,780
 humans made wire by soaking steel in urine,

766
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:37,240
 but for realizing that water works just as well.

767
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,620
 (laughing)

768
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,260
 - We're so stupid.

769
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,100
 - I love it.

770
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:41,940
 - How recent was this?

771
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,140
 It's just like last year we weren't the same.

772
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:47,420
 - Yeah, someone squatting down to urinate on the steel again

773
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:50,620
 saying, "We definitely not just put it under the towel."

774
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,180
 - What was the thought behind it?

775
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,300
 - Well, I read this in a great book actually called

776
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,020
 How to Invent Everything,

777
00:29:56,020 --> 00:30:00,140
 and the thought I think was that urine was used

778
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:03,140
 for various things historically, wasn't it?

779
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,540
 The tanning industry springs to mind,

780
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,940
 but going through the podcast archive,

781
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,700
 it was used for millions of other things,

782
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:11,780
 and so this was in Altena in Germany,

783
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,940
 and it was in 1650,

784
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:17,500
 and at that point to make wire out of steel,

785
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,300
 you had to pull a steel rod,

786
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,380
 so like a thicker rod of steel,

787
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:24,140
 through a funnel of decreasing diameter,

788
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,900
 so you know like when you did filtration in science,

789
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,740
 you had those funnels,

790
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,780
 and so you'd put steel in the wide end,

791
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:31,580
 and you drag it through until it gets thinner and thinner,

792
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,940
 and then you get a thin wire coming out the other end,

793
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,700
 and to stop there being too much friction,

794
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,420
 'cause you're putting it through really hard,

795
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,780
 you use grease or oil,

796
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:41,580
 and then in this place called Altena in Germany,

797
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,500
 someone, according to reports from the time,

798
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,620
 accidentally sort of urinated all over it,

799
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,980
 and then tried it,

800
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:52,940
 and found that it works just as well as the grease and oil,

801
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,460
 and so I thought, oh, it must be something special

802
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,300
 about the wee.

803
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:58,220
 - I believe, I found something from quite near the time

804
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:01,780
 that said that this guy who's called Johann Gerdis,

805
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:06,860
 he had been so annoyed that he couldn't draw it well enough

806
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,620
 that he'd thrown his material,

807
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:13,140
 (speaking in foreign language)

808
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:13,980
 - Yes.

809
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,340
 - Which is where everyone casts their water,

810
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,540
 so he didn't urinate on it,

811
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,380
 he got annoyed and threw it in the corner

812
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,940
 into the tile and that's where.

813
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:22,540
 - Yeah, exactly, so he tossed it into the loo,

814
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,700
 and then he thought, oh no, that was,

815
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,660
 I threw a strop there, that was silly, wasn't I?

816
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,820
 But I'll go and get it back,

817
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:30,020
 and so then he went and sort of got my elbow deep.

818
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,340
 - Pissy metal back.

819
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:34,620
 - Exactly, climbed down into the vat of wee,

820
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,020
 got it back out,

821
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:38,940
 and then found that it works better, and--

822
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:39,780
 - And when you say work better,

823
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,660
 is it just softer and more malleable?

824
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,060
 - Yeah, so what it seemed to do,

825
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:46,380
 what it did do is make a soft coating around the metal,

826
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,460
 which reduces the friction when you pull it through.

827
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:51,140
 Now, we now do know that water also does that,

828
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,740
 but for 200 years,

829
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,940
 people who worked in this factory

830
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,380
 would provide urine to it,

831
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,580
 and actually their wives and children

832
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:59,020
 would also donate their urine to this factory.

833
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,860
 - I like the fact that they,

834
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:03,500
 in between the wee and the water,

835
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,420
 they worked out that beer worked.

836
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,260
 - Really?

837
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,060
 - So they did it with the wee for ages,

838
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,380
 and then after about 100 years, someone tried beer,

839
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,940
 they went, oh, this works just as well.

840
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,780
 - That's so good.

841
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:13,620
 - We don't need to whistle it.

842
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:16,180
 - Stop trying, try like 100 different things, yeah?

843
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,020
 - Maybe they did.

844
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,060
 - I kind of wonder what else would work

845
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,300
 that we haven't thought of yet.

846
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,140
 - Yeah.

847
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:20,980
 - Better than water.

848
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,220
 - I think once you've got to water,

849
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,460
 it's like, okay, good, this is a simplest trick.

850
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,140
 - I so love to have been there on the day

851
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,180
 that the person who came into town and said,

852
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,700
 you know you can just use water,

853
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,740
 so they've said that, so can you?

854
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,940
 - Or like, dicks in hands.

855
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,700
 (all laughing)

856
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,020
 - Standing here, dick in hand.

857
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:39,340
 (all laughing)

858
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,660
 - You've been so embarrassed.

859
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,620
 How long have you been doing this?

860
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,460
 200 years.

861
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,900
 - It's not important, doesn't matter.

862
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,940
 - Yeah.

863
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:48,780
 - Wow.

864
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,620
 - I think it's also interesting that you make,

865
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,060
 why I like you make spaghetti,

866
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,820
 you just squeeze it in a,

867
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,020
 I mean, it might have pissed off my spaghetti.

868
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,380
 I mean, squeezing it through, squeezing it through her face.

869
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,500
 - Actually, if you could get it in water,

870
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,340
 it's even better.

871
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:02,740
 (all laughing)

872
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:05,020
 - You know that smell that iron and steel has,

873
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,300
 like doorknobs and stuff, you know that?

874
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,140
 - Oh yeah.

875
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:07,980
 - That smell.

876
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:08,820
 - Yeah, yeah.

877
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,660
 - The metal smell.

878
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,500
 - So you actually don't,

879
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,460
 because it turns out that it doesn't smell,

880
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,780
 and you know what it actually is,

881
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:17,420
 is the oils and chemicals excreted by you,

882
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,740
 reacting with the surface of the metal.

883
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,580
 - Very similarly,

884
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,940
 and every kitchen should have this,

885
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,060
 I don't have this,

886
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,980
 but you can get stainless steel soap.

887
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,220
 And I've never heard of that before.

888
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,060
 - Oh.

889
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:28,900
 - Yeah.

890
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:29,740
 - What?

891
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,580
 - Yeah.

892
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,420
 - Well, 'cause stainless steel is like antibacterial, right?

893
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,500
 Which is why, like a lot of doorknobs are made out of it,

894
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,660
 and especially when you go into public toilets

895
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,140
 and stuff, everything's metal.

896
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:35,980
 - Yeah.

897
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,300
 - 'Cause bacteria can't last very long.

898
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,620
 - So you don't need to wash your hands

899
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,460
 when you're leaving the loo.

900
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,500
 You just turn the metal doorknob and you say,

901
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,660
 "I've done it, as long as you do it both hands."

902
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,140
 - You're not made of metal, Adam.

903
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,900
 (all laughing)

904
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,540
 - Now, this is specifically for,

905
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,700
 if you're cutting up onions or you're cutting up garlic,

906
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:52,340
 and the smell gets stuck to your fingers,

907
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,140
 and you're like, "Oh, God, I smell of this."

908
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:56,420
 Rubbing your hands against stainless steel

909
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:59,260
 creates a reaction that knocks out the smell from it.

910
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:02,540
 This is, I don't think it's scientifically proven at all,

911
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,820
 but they do sell, as it were, bars of stainless steel soap.

912
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,700
 - I actually think it is scientifically proven.

913
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,540
 - What?

914
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:09,380
 - But it doesn't really work.

915
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,220
 - That's exactly it.

916
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,500
 - No, it's not, it's not actually practical.

917
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,660
 - But it's like, "Nah, I've definitely rubbed

918
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,260
 my garlicky fingers up and down,

919
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,220
 stainless steel stuff to no avail."

920
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,780
 - And does real soap not work at all for garlic?

921
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:22,420
 - No, I don't think anything works for it,

922
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,580
 except using garlic in a jar,

923
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:26,140
 which I've resorted to now in order to sustain my marriage.

924
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:29,340
 - I think just being happy with smells of garlic.

925
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,860
 - All that, James, I wish life were that simple.

926
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:32,940
 (all laughing)

927
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,940
 - What a weird cryptic sentence about your marriage

928
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,020
 that just slipped in there.

929
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,340
 (all laughing)

930
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,220
 - Anna's husband is a vampire.

931
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:42,540
 (all laughing)

932
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,940
 - Can I give you a QI question,

933
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,740
 but you've got to pretend you're in ancient Rome,

934
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:47,580
 and then it works.

935
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,740
 - Sure, do we have to do it in Latin?

936
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:50,580
 - Yes, so that's okay.

937
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,780
 I'm sure the listeners at home are fluent.

938
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,620
 So--

939
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,460
 - Shall we?

940
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,540
 (all laughing)

941
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:58,340
 - Oh, no, Alex actually can do this.

942
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,460
 - It's a guy studying Latin.

943
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,540
 - You only need to know one word,

944
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,780
 and that's the Latin word for steel.

945
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,740
 And astonishingly, they had a version of steel

946
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,580
 as far back as then,

947
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:09,460
 which was invented in India about 400 BC,

948
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:12,540
 but it wasn't able to be mass produced until the 19th century.

949
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,580
 But they did have it, made it to ancient Rome.

950
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:17,620
 The Latin word for steel is chalebe,

951
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:20,580
 and it was named after that chalebe's people

952
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,140
 who lived on the Black Sea.

953
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:24,580
 Okay, so you're in Latin QI.

954
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:28,260
 What did the chalebe's people invent?

955
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:31,300
 - The chalebe people, they made metal.

956
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,380
 - I mean, the Latin for steel is chalebe.

957
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,220
 I'm just gonna say that.

958
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,060
 - Oh, okay, I see.

959
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,820
 - Is it the word caliber?

960
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:40,660
 - X-caliber, swords.

961
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,980
 - Dan, can I get, I feel like you're the one

962
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,580
 who gives the more obvious stupid answer.

963
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,420
 Can you do that now?

964
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:47,100
 - I'm still busy trying to picture myself.

965
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:50,060
 What character I am, what do I know, what do I not know?

966
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,900
 - Chalebe, and what there's supposed to be

967
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,260
 an obvious answer to this.

968
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,940
 - They invented steel.

969
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,140
 - Oh, they invented steel.

970
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,100
 Did they invent steel?

971
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,700
 - And then you get a klaxon.

972
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:01,060
 - They invented steel.

973
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:01,900
 - I don't know what's going on.

974
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:04,860
 I think God, Anna didn't pitch QI to the BBC initially.

975
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,700
 - It's a script editor.

976
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,300
 I don't understand how she's made such a mess of this.

977
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,980
 - I've rewritten all the scripts in Latin.

978
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,860
 This is so awkward.

979
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,380
 I'm saying to a Latin audience,

980
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,540
 what did the chalebe's people invent?

981
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,020
 You know, speaking Latin,

982
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,020
 that chalebe is Latin for steel.

983
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,340
 - Okay, so it's steel.

984
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,340
 - Steel, woo, woo, woo.

985
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,340
 - Klaxon, okay, go ahead, okay, yeah, let me see.

986
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,180
 - And they didn't,

987
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,300
 they just invented another kind of hybrid iron.

988
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,620
 They had this kind of iron, steel.

989
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:30,700
 - Do you wanna hear about the barbed wire was?

990
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,540
 - Yes.

991
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,860
 - Okay, so barbed wire invented

992
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:37,780
 in 1873 in America by Joseph Glidden

993
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:40,540
 and used by farmers to protect their farms.

994
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,220
 Who was not happy about it?

995
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,740
 - The blunt wire manufacturers.

996
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,580
 (laughing)

997
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,020
 - Yeah, fence makers.

998
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:47,860
 - Yeah.

999
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,020
 - Oh, yeah, that's true.

1000
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,180
 - Ramblers.

1001
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,660
 - Ramblers, lots of ramblers in there.

1002
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,500
 - Golfers.

1003
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,020
 - Golfers, yeah, these are all great answers.

1004
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,140
 But all wrong.

1005
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:59,220
 - I actually feel like ramblers,

1006
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,500
 'cause I think I may know the answer,

1007
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,860
 but ramblers might be a vaguely correct-ish.

1008
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,340
 People who wanted to ramble, right?

1009
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,180
 - I think it's true.

1010
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,860
 I mean, not many people like barbed wire, I'd say, but.

1011
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:11,420
 - The answer is cowboys,

1012
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:15,940
 because if you had a farm and you didn't have fences,

1013
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:18,380
 your cows and sheep could run anywhere,

1014
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:21,460
 but you kept them in the right place by employing cowboys.

1015
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,700
 But as soon as you had bad wire,

1016
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,860
 you didn't need to employ cowboys anymore.

1017
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:27,180
 - This is the first 18. - Who ramble freely,

1018
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,420
 which is why I've given Alex half the points.

1019
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:32,340
 - Rambles, they're on horses.

1020
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:35,020
 - Yeah, I think of rambling as just sort of roaming free,

1021
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,780
 but do you think it has to be on foot?

1022
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:39,180
 - I think what we're doing now is rambling.

1023
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,020
 - But the other thing,

1024
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,940
 the other people didn't like it were small ranchers,

1025
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,220
 because if you had a big ranch

1026
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,140
 and you could afford loads of barbed wire,

1027
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:49,180
 you could put loads of barbed wire around your farm.

1028
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,580
 But actually, in those days,

1029
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,540
 people weren't really sure where one farm stopped

1030
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,060
 and another farm started.

1031
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,460
 So if you were a small rancher,

1032
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:58,060
 you would often find that you would turn up to your ranch

1033
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:58,900
 and there's a load of barbed wire

1034
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,700
 and you couldn't get to your stuff anymore.

1035
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:04,620
 And so there was a huge amount of violence and tension

1036
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:07,460
 between these kind of small ranchers and the big ranchers.

1037
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,340
 And there were wire cutting groups

1038
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,260
 that would go out and cut all the wires.

1039
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,700
 And actually Grover Cleveland,

1040
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,380
 the president had to send in the army

1041
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:17,300
 to remove any unlawful barbed wire fences.

1042
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:20,300
 - They formed sort of gangs, didn't they?

1043
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,300
 With really fun names.

1044
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,020
 They were called like the blue devils, the owls.

1045
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:26,740
 - They supported Iron Maiden, didn't they?

1046
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,060
 - Sorry, you're right.

1047
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:31,700
 - Native Americans as well didn't like it

1048
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,300
 because it stopped buffaloes rambling.

1049
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:39,260
 I'm gonna make ramble happen.

1050
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:42,780
 And they depended so much on their livelihood for buffaloes.

1051
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:43,980
 It's one of the reasons that buffaloes

1052
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,820
 basically went extinct by the end of the century

1053
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,940
 is that they couldn't roam free anymore.

1054
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,620
 They were fenced in.

1055
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,340
 And it was all kind of Lincoln's fault, wasn't it?

1056
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,660
 'Cause he signed this act,

1057
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:56,020
 which said everyone can have a bunch of free land

1058
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:58,300
 in the Wild West if you agree to farm it.

1059
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,740
 So all these farmers moved there.

1060
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:02,620
 And then we're like, how do we stop these buffaloes

1061
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,700
 from trampling all over our crops?

1062
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:05,540
 - Bloody Lincoln.

1063
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,820
 - Electric wire, right?

1064
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,220
 After the barbed wire.

1065
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,060
 - Yeah.

1066
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,340
 - I'm just trying to think.

1067
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:12,580
 I wonder how many people died in that small town

1068
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,660
 who were having a nostalgic piss on a bit of wire.

1069
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:16,900
 (laughing)

1070
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:20,060
 - I think that's a myth, isn't it?

1071
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:22,660
 If you piss on electric feds, you get electrocuted.

1072
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,020
 Don't try it at home.

1073
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:24,860
 Don't try it at home.

1074
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:25,940
 Who's got electric feds at home?

1075
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:28,660
 (laughing)

1076
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,980
 - Get out of my room, Mum.

1077
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,060
 I did warn you.

1078
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,140
 (laughing)

1079
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,180
 - I think the myth that I remember,

1080
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:36,140
 and again, I'm not sure that this is true,

1081
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:39,940
 so people shouldn't try it at someone else's home.

1082
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:43,300
 But your urine stream isn't usually a complete stream.

1083
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,900
 It's usually got gaps in it enough

1084
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,460
 that the electricity can't travel up it.

1085
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,140
 - Did anyone come across

1086
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,020
 this Guardian Notes and Queries section?

1087
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,740
 So you know, the Guardian notes and queries

1088
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,660
 and someone asks a question and lots of,

1089
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:57,940
 often people who have inside knowledge answer underneath.

1090
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:00,860
 And there's one that's When Was Wire Invented.

1091
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,180
 Did any of you see this?

1092
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,020
 - No.

1093
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:03,940
 - It's just very confusing.

1094
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,820
 So there's When Was Wire Invented

1095
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,980
 and then various people underneath give their answers.

1096
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:11,660
 And one of the answers is,

1097
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:14,620
 fierce controversy surrounded the invention of wire.

1098
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,540
 And it goes on to explain that Thomas Malham

1099
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,740
 said he invented wire in 1830

1100
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,340
 at his foundry in Sheffield.

1101
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:23,260
 But a Frenchman, Jean-François Martin,

1102
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:25,820
 also said he'd invented wire at the same time.

1103
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:27,100
 There was this legal action

1104
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,620
 contesting the right to the patent.

1105
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,780
 It was never resolved 'cause Thomas Malham died

1106
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:32,500
 of an inflamed liver.

1107
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,500
 And then it said, it's extraordinary fact.

1108
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,700
 Thomas Malham's memorial is an Abney Park cemetery,

1109
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,540
 very near where I used to live,

1110
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,660
 which has lots of amazing gravestones on it.

1111
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:42,340
 And it's now rusted away,

1112
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:45,180
 but it used to be constructed entirely of wire

1113
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,700
 in the shape of an anvil topped with a falcon.

1114
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,500
 And the source was a book called Wire,

1115
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:54,120
 It's History and Application by Dr. A. Stone.

1116
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,700
 (all laughing)

1117
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,980
 - It's a different material.

1118
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:02,620
 - Well, it is a different material.

1119
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,300
 But there's nothing obviously in this to give away

1120
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,580
 that it's completely made up.

1121
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,140
 It's completely made up. - Oh, it's completely made up.

1122
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,460
 Oh, okay, fine.

1123
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,580
 - This person gives this extraordinary story

1124
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,140
 of the history of the Foundry of Wire.

1125
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,900
 And I was like, brilliant, something fascinating.

1126
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,020
 God, there's Abney Park.

1127
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,780
 I can't believe I never saw that.

1128
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,900
 - It's completely false.

1129
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,980
 - So this is the story of you reading a comment section,

1130
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,100
 finding the information ought to be true.

1131
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,540
 - It's not a comment section.

1132
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:24,340
 It's Guardian Notes and Queries, okay?

1133
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:27,940
 You get highbrow experts replying to people about,

1134
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,780
 and then practices. - But the joke is can slip in.

1135
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:30,620
 That's the problem.

1136
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,580
 - Yeah, it's not a very good joke though, is it?

1137
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:33,980
 - I don't know, A. Stone.

1138
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:34,820
 - A. Stone?

1139
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:37,140
 - Pretty good, I did laugh really hard at this.

1140
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,300
 - That's not a joke.

1141
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,540
 I know jokes, guys.

1142
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:42,580
 (all laughing)

1143
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,860
 - Just on other things you can use your info.

1144
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,500
 Virgin Boy eggs.

1145
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,340
 - Oh, yeah.

1146
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,180
 - Do you remember this?

1147
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,020
 - Virgin Boy eggs.

1148
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:52,700
 - So they are a traditional dish from China, from Dongyang.

1149
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,100
 And basically, it's exactly what it sounds like.

1150
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,860
 They boil eggs in the urine of young boys.

1151
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:59,260
 So like 10 or younger.

1152
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:01,940
 - That's not what Virgin Boy eggs sounds like.

1153
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:02,780
 That's gonna be 20.

1154
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,780
 - It's what it translates with boy egg, fine.

1155
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:05,900
 Like, again, urine boy eggs.

1156
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:06,740
 You're absolutely right, yeah.

1157
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:07,580
 - Urine boy eggs, got it.

1158
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:08,420
 - You're trying to, sorry.

1159
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:10,140
 They are, it translates as Virgin Boy eggs,

1160
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:12,460
 Virgin Boy being like small boy eggs.

1161
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:15,500
 And yeah, they, all through the town,

1162
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,780
 the kids are encouraged to,

1163
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:17,740
 when they go to the loon schools,

1164
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:19,060
 they either can go to the normal toilet

1165
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:21,420
 or they can go and pee in like a collection bucket

1166
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:22,740
 in the corridor.

1167
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:27,180
 And then all of this urine gets taken

1168
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,940
 and then eggs are boiled in them.

1169
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:31,060
 And it's a whole process where like they're double boiled

1170
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,620
 in this urine and people eat them

1171
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:33,780
 and it's like a delicacy.

1172
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:36,740
 - Yeah, urine's been used like that for a lot, hasn't it?

1173
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:37,580
 - Yeah, it's interesting.

1174
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,260
 There is definitely like a legit ick factor there

1175
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,700
 where I'm like, it's somebody else's urine

1176
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,180
 that this has been cooked in.

1177
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:43,020
 - Yeah, yeah.

1178
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:43,860
 - It's very interesting.

1179
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,500
 - They had 100 years eggs.

1180
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,340
 - 100 years eggs?

1181
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:48,900
 - Yeah, they're like supposed to be 100 years old.

1182
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,100
 They're not really 100 years old,

1183
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,020
 but they are quite old.

1184
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:51,860
 - Very old, yeah.

1185
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,780
 - Yeah, and they just taste really sulfurous.

1186
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,340
 - But they haven't been bathed in urine, have they?

1187
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,180
 - No, they're just standard.

1188
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,540
 - They're just a different kind of weird egg, yeah.

1189
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:00,060
 - It's the urine thing I don't like, yeah.

1190
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:02,060
 - I can talk about weird eggs that I've eaten.

1191
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:03,700
 I had that at Balut, you know,

1192
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:07,180
 that has the baby chickens, the embryo of the chickens.

1193
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:08,020
 - Oh yeah.

1194
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:09,740
 All right, so save it for your spin-off weird eggs

1195
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:13,020
 I've eaten podcast, which will run forever and ever.

1196
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:14,700
 It's, they've actually poached me.

1197
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:15,540
 Poached me.

1198
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:16,380
 - Hey.

1199
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,220
 (laughing)

1200
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,740
 - The rest is weird eggs.

1201
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:20,980
 This is you, go find your podcast.

1202
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:22,860
 (laughing)

1203
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:25,980
 It's me and Delia Smith just talking about weird eggs.

1204
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:27,320
 - Weird eggs.

1205
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,900
 (upbeat music)

1206
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:35,340
 - Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,

1207
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:36,940
 and that is Alex.

1208
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:39,260
 - My fact this week is that dragonfly wings

1209
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:40,980
 are equipped with tiny knives

1210
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:43,820
 that physically rip bacteria apart.

1211
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:44,660
 - What?

1212
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:45,500
 - Nice.

1213
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,340
 - It's amazing.

1214
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:47,180
 - Oh my God.

1215
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:48,000
 - It's just, it's the property they have

1216
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,840
 that keeps their wings clean.

1217
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:49,680
 - So clever.

1218
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:50,520
 - Can I ask a question?

1219
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,360
 - Yeah.

1220
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,020
 - Alex, straight off the bat.

1221
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:54,820
 I've currently got a chest infection,

1222
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:56,620
 and I'm on antibiotics.

1223
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:59,820
 Could I instead chuck some dragonfly wings?

1224
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:01,440
 - That's such a great question.

1225
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,140
 - I don't want to answer that in case you die.

1226
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:06,700
 (laughing)

1227
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:07,540
 - I thought you were gonna say,

1228
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:09,740
 should I strap a series of knives to my arms

1229
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:11,040
 and flap them around?

1230
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:11,880
 - Yeah.

1231
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:12,860
 - All sort of option.

1232
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:13,700
 - I think probably not.

1233
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:14,820
 I think dragonflies are amazing

1234
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:16,380
 if humans use them as inspiration

1235
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:18,340
 for scientific innovations so much,

1236
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:20,700
 but one of the things that we are doing

1237
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,500
 is trying to emulate this,

1238
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:23,820
 what's called, they're called nanopillars,

1239
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:26,240
 these tiny, tiny sort of blunt pillars

1240
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,360
 that are so, so small.

1241
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:30,740
 They're 100,000th of the width of a human hair.

1242
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:31,860
 I mean, so, so tiny.

1243
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:33,580
 So bacteria literally lands on them,

1244
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:35,200
 gets caught between two and gets ripped apart.

1245
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,220
 I mean, it's absolutely astonishing how small it is.

1246
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:38,960
 - There's more than 10 billion of them

1247
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,060
 per wing, basically, on each one.

1248
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:41,980
 - Absolutely mad.

1249
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:42,820
 - Yeah.

1250
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:44,700
 And they're really, really good at destroying

1251
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,140
 almost all bacteria that lands on them.

1252
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:48,260
 So, there's a university in Melbourne, Australia

1253
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:51,300
 who have successfully made a sort of plastic version.

1254
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:54,020
 So, that could be the new stainless steel.

1255
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:55,860
 You know, next time you go into your public bathroom,

1256
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,460
 there'll be a plastic handle.

1257
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:00,860
 - So scientists have managed to make stuff that small?

1258
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:01,700
 - Yeah.

1259
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:02,540
 - Yeah.

1260
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:03,380
 - Well done.

1261
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:04,220
 - Well done.

1262
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:05,060
 - I don't know.

1263
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:05,900
 - Well, you can see when they sort of,

1264
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:06,740
 you can do novels on rice now.

1265
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:09,720
 - You know that that's quite different to having something

1266
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,740
 that there's 10 billion of them on a wing.

1267
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:14,160
 - I don't think they've been manually sharpening each one

1268
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,720
 with a tiny, tiny set of carving knives or anything.

1269
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,320
 - I once pushed an electron

1270
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,280
 with a scanning tunneling microscope.

1271
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,120
 - Wow.

1272
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:21,960
 - Right.

1273
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,280
 And it took me about an hour and a half.

1274
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,120
 (laughing)

1275
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,480
 - It was quite a long time ago.

1276
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,400
 No, just like to slightly other place

1277
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,480
 to where it already was.

1278
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,720
 Like, I just moved it.

1279
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:32,680
 - Can you just blown it?

1280
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:33,720
 - No, 'cause it's an electron.

1281
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,840
 It's so small.

1282
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:37,660
 So you have this little sort of, it's like a needle,

1283
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:39,740
 but it says some kind of quantum effect.

1284
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:40,580
 I don't know.

1285
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:42,140
 I did study it, but I don't really understand it.

1286
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:44,700
 But I had the machine and then it was like a computer game

1287
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,180
 thing and you would kind of push this one electron.

1288
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:48,020
 And the idea was I need to.

1289
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:49,060
 - Oh, they meant you to.

1290
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:49,900
 - Yeah.

1291
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:50,740
 - It wasn't like OCD.

1292
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:51,740
 You didn't just, it's like walking in

1293
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:53,180
 and seeing a painting slightly askew.

1294
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:55,420
 You're like, oh, I'm really uncomfortable with that.

1295
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,580
 - I really like Princess and the P.E. too.

1296
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:58,780
 This place is such a mess.

1297
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:01,020
 (laughing)

1298
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:05,800
 - But yeah, dragonflies are actually astonishing.

1299
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:06,640
 - They're incredible.

1300
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,480
 - They are amazing.

1301
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:08,840
 Every fact I learn about them is that you're

1302
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,200
 the most metal insane.

1303
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,840
 They are the most efficient killers in nature.

1304
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,000
 They are the most efficient predators.

1305
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,520
 They kill over 95% of the prey that they chase,

1306
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,360
 which is like, that's unbelievable.

1307
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,560
 We're so lucky they're so small and they don't eat us.

1308
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,400
 - Yeah.

1309
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:24,240
 I love you called them the most metal.

1310
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,120
 They've opened for Iron Maiden.

1311
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,280
 (laughing)

1312
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,600
 - When they're lava, so like little worm things,

1313
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,560
 they kind of live underwater.

1314
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,820
 And then they shed the larval skin

1315
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:36,980
 and start to become a dragonfly.

1316
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:39,700
 And they create these wings,

1317
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:41,500
 but the wings are like made of jelly.

1318
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,960
 They're not like the wings that they have when they're older.

1319
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:45,660
 So they need to dry them out.

1320
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:50,200
 And so they produce sodium bicarbonate in the rectum

1321
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:53,060
 and they fart it out and it reacts with the water

1322
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:56,260
 and it creates CO2 and it dries out their wings,

1323
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:58,660
 which means that they become proper wings.

1324
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:00,420
 - They are their own hairdryer.

1325
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:02,140
 - Their ass is a hairdryer.

1326
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:03,080
 - But also when they're lava,

1327
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,680
 they eat through their anus as well.

1328
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,880
 And they also spend most of their lives as lava.

1329
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:10,000
 So they can, some species live up to five years,

1330
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,480
 but they spend nearly all of it as a lava.

1331
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:12,320
 And then they become a dragonfly

1332
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,000
 for just a couple of months and flying around.

1333
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
 - I always think it's weird with, it's not weird at all,

1334
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,960
 but it's unfair to these animals

1335
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,400
 that we think of them as dragonflies.

1336
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,000
 When actually for almost all their life,

1337
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,400
 they're not dragonflies at all.

1338
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,120
 - I think they want to be thought of as dragonflies

1339
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,280
 rather than these weird underwater insects.

1340
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,240
 A bit creepy, yeah, yeah.

1341
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,080
 It must be, I watched a great,

1342
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,840
 I watched a couple of great documentaries actually about them.

1343
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,400
 One of them was talking about the extraordinary moment

1344
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,340
 when they're climbing up a blade of sort of grass,

1345
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:38,760
 which they would do when they're emerging

1346
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,740
 from nymph phase into dragonfly phase,

1347
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:42,500
 climb a blade of grass out of the water.

1348
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:45,320
 And that first time that you feel the weight of gravity

1349
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,520
 on you, they've been floating in water all of their lives.

1350
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,320
 And suddenly they slow down massively

1351
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:53,120
 'cause it's suddenly having to wrench their body weight up.

1352
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,040
 And then if you watch videos of them emerging

1353
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,620
 from the Exoskeleton, it's very cool.

1354
00:47:57,620 --> 00:48:01,880
 So their abdomen as a dragonfly is concertinid,

1355
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:05,540
 just like a telescope inside of their larval cell.

1356
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:06,860
 So when they burst out,

1357
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:08,740
 suddenly it's like pulling a telescope out

1358
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:10,600
 to its full extension.

1359
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:13,660
 And when they climb up, they can retreat at any point.

1360
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:16,780
 So they're not dragonfly yet until their massive googly eyes,

1361
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:17,820
 you know, they've got this big eyes,

1362
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:20,940
 until their eyes turn cloudy and white.

1363
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,980
 And then once the eyes have gone milky,

1364
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:23,860
 there's no going back.

1365
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:25,060
 - Oh my God, that's incredible.

1366
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:25,900
 - That's awesome.

1367
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:26,740
 - That's how you can tell.

1368
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:28,460
 - Wow, did you know they can't walk?

1369
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:31,020
 They've got six legs and they can climb with them,

1370
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:32,060
 but they can't walk on them.

1371
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:35,100
 But they mostly use them to like grab their prey in mid air

1372
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:37,100
 and like stab it and like.

1373
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:39,300
 - They're not called dragonwalks, Alex.

1374
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:41,620
 (laughing)

1375
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:43,420
 - I feel it's weird having to like as in most,

1376
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:46,820
 most flies and insects land or can also walk on there.

1377
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:48,860
 Let them use it to like stand and walk.

1378
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:50,660
 Whereas dragonflies specifically use it to grab

1379
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:52,580
 and hunt them more like pincers, that's great.

1380
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:54,980
 - They're so awesome that the U.S. decided to create

1381
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:59,300
 a spying dragonfly drone, which was based on

1382
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:01,380
 all these amazing things that dragonflies could do.

1383
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:04,420
 So it had tiny beads that could reflect light

1384
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:06,020
 and could check for oscillations.

1385
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:07,740
 So you could work out what someone was saying

1386
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:09,100
 from a massive distance away.

1387
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:12,220
 It could flap its wings 1800 times per minute

1388
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:16,460
 using the lithium nitrate crystals controlled by lasers.

1389
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:19,540
 It costs about $2 million for each ones,

1390
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,980
 but they only ever tested it in lab conditions.

1391
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:23,180
 And then when they took it out,

1392
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:24,980
 they realized it couldn't cope with wind.

1393
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:27,100
 (laughing)

1394
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:29,900
 - I found a documentary by David Attenborough,

1395
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:31,980
 which was called "Dragons and Damsels".

1396
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:33,940
 He made it in 2019, it was a TV special.

1397
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:35,940
 And I really wanted to watch it.

1398
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:37,780
 And so I was Googling "Dragons and Damsels"

1399
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:39,700
 to see where you could get it.

1400
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:42,140
 Sadly, the closest I could get was a documentary

1401
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:46,140
 of similar length, about 45 minutes called "Dragons and Damsels",

1402
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:49,340
 released on YouTube by Buxton Civic Associations

1403
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:51,940
 during the pandemic and hosted by a chap called

1404
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:56,420
 Richard Nisley Marple, which was really good as well.

1405
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:58,260
 And so I'm gonna tell you some things I've learned

1406
00:49:58,260 --> 00:49:59,980
 from "Dragons and Damsels".

1407
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:02,660
 The production quality's slightly lower.

1408
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:04,060
 There were interruptions like,

1409
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:06,460
 "Can you see my cursor as I'm moving it out there?"

1410
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:08,660
 (laughing)

1411
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:10,460
 And sort of, "Can everyone see me on the screen?"

1412
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:12,540
 or "Can you see the thing I'm showing you?"

1413
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:13,380
 But...

1414
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:14,220
 (laughing)

1415
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:15,300
 - I'm never gonna, Attenborough doing that

1416
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:16,620
 or flying him out to the art, because they're like,

1417
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:17,780
 "Why can't I see them?"

1418
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:19,860
 (laughing)

1419
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:21,100
 - But I would love to see Attenborough

1420
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:23,660
 doing a new narration over this documentary.

1421
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:26,180
 "Here we see the human attempt, the cursor."

1422
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:28,860
 - Yes, the thumbnails have confused

1423
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,980
 the good Jesus out of him.

1424
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:31,820
 - Was it good though?

1425
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:32,660
 - It was really good.

1426
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:34,660
 So he said, "Sweetly," he said,

1427
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:37,220
 "The Southern Hawker dragonfly.

1428
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:39,260
 "They're the only dragonflies that will fly up to you

1429
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:41,020
 "and look you straight in the eye."

1430
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:41,860
 - That's scary.

1431
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:44,060
 - He said, "It's quite frightening."

1432
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:46,420
 - Sounds like a U.S. drug, doesn't it really?

1433
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:47,860
 - Maybe that's what they are.

1434
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:49,300
 They always have been.

1435
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:50,500
 He said, "The way to tell the difference

1436
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,220
 "between damselflies and dragonflies,"

1437
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:53,140
 where there are many ways,

1438
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:55,220
 but one of them is, and you have to look quite closely,

1439
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:58,220
 but during mating, they both grab the female from behind,

1440
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:02,780
 but dragonflies grab the female on the back of the head,

1441
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:05,860
 whereas damsels grab the female on the back of the neck.

1442
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:07,620
 So you do have to be quite close.

1443
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:10,340
 (laughing)

1444
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:12,300
 And also I really enjoyed a metaphor he used,

1445
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:14,540
 which actually referenced a fact that we mentioned before,

1446
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:17,020
 which is that ancient dragonflies millions of years ago

1447
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:19,140
 were up to a meter wide.

1448
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:21,100
 And as he said, you can imagine what sort of a mess

1449
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:22,860
 that would make if it hit your windscreen.

1450
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:24,500
 (laughing)

1451
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,540
 I actually laughed out loud at that.

1452
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:28,300
 And I've never laughed out loud at David Attenborough.

1453
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:30,340
 - Or any of our jokes on this podcast yet.

1454
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:31,620
 - She knows jokes.

1455
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:32,460
 - She does.

1456
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:33,780
 - Anyone knows jokes.

1457
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:35,460
 - But the female dragonflies also,

1458
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,780
 they fake their deaths to avoid having sex sometimes.

1459
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:38,620
 - Yes.

1460
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:39,940
 - Oh, they do do that, don't they?

1461
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:41,140
 - And the other thing I know about dragonflies' sex

1462
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:43,580
 is that the males have spoon-shaped penises

1463
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:46,060
 so that they can scoop out sperm of the previous guy

1464
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:47,100
 if he finds any inside.

1465
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:49,260
 - Ah, that is clever.

1466
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:51,060
 Bit gross, but yeah.

1467
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:52,700
 Well, no, but necessary, right?

1468
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:53,860
 - Well, yeah, I suppose so.

1469
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,500
 - Arguably humans have that as well.

1470
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:56,340
 - Really, yeah.

1471
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:57,180
 - What?

1472
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:59,860
 The idea is that the bell-end shape at the top of a penis

1473
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:03,900
 could possibly be used to scrape out other people's semen.

1474
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:07,220
 - Yeah, or just get a half-cut tennis ball

1475
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:10,820
 and you can plunge that out.

1476
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:14,300
 - I'm actually starting to question your fact now, Alex,

1477
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:16,180
 having just looked at my notes,

1478
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:19,780
 'cause Anna previously gave us a fake fact from A Stone.

1479
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:22,300
 And your fact about an insect

1480
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:24,380
 comes from someone called a wolf.

1481
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:25,220
 - Really?

1482
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:26,540
 - Yeah.

1483
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:29,780
 It's Dr. Annalena Wolf.

1484
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:31,660
 She does make this, there's this amazing point

1485
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:32,980
 that's made inside this article,

1486
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:34,180
 which you touched on earlier,

1487
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:36,980
 which is basically all the things that we're looking for

1488
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:39,260
 for modern invention,

1489
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:42,060
 evolution has worked out somewhere on our planet.

1490
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:43,380
 We just need to look around

1491
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:46,260
 for a four billion years worth of evolution

1492
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:47,940
 and you eventually find something

1493
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:51,100
 that can be then taken into the lab to try and mimic,

1494
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:52,580
 which is pretty awesome.

1495
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:54,260
 - It's the mimicking that's hard, I think, sometimes.

1496
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:57,020
 We actually don't have four billion years to make it.

1497
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:59,180
 We've got about a week before the funding dries up.

1498
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:00,020
 - Yeah.

1499
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:00,860
 (laughing)

1500
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:03,460
 But they've been around 300 million years.

1501
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:05,500
 Dinosaurs were walking the planet.

1502
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,100
 I mean, that's always, 'cause in my head,

1503
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,860
 the romanticism of the dinosaurs

1504
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:10,620
 being just because of how old they were in alive,

1505
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:11,900
 and we forget all these animals.

1506
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:12,860
 Dragonflies were there.

1507
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:13,980
 - Sure, a different version.

1508
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:16,700
 - In fairness to people who make cartoons

1509
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:18,060
 and dinosaur movies,

1510
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:20,260
 they do often have dragonflies flying around.

1511
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:21,100
 - They do, they do, that's true.

1512
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:21,940
 - They do, that's true.

1513
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:23,060
 - Dragonflies, yeah, that's so true.

1514
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:23,900
 - That is true.

1515
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:24,740
 - Yeah.

1516
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:25,860
 - One other incredible thing about them

1517
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:28,820
 you wouldn't expect is how far they can fly,

1518
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:31,100
 and that's another thing that scientists are looking into.

1519
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:32,500
 Can we replicate it?

1520
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,220
 'Cause the globe skimmer dragonfly

1521
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:37,060
 has the record for the longest insect migration,

1522
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:40,900
 and it does a round trip of 18,000 kilometers.

1523
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:41,740
 - That is insane.

1524
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:43,820
 It's always one of these things where I think,

1525
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:46,460
 does it count if it's multi-generational?

1526
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:48,700
 - Yeah, absolutely not, yeah.

1527
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:50,860
 - 'Cause it is one of these things where the dragonfly,

1528
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:52,860
 this particular dragonfly lays its eggs

1529
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:54,540
 and lives and mates in shallow pools,

1530
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:56,580
 'cause the pools are warmer if they're shallow,

1531
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:57,980
 and so it can grow faster.

1532
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:00,500
 So it follows the rain, so it can follow shallow pools,

1533
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:03,060
 so it flies from India to Africa,

1534
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:06,260
 and then the next generation flies back.

1535
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:07,860
 - If I went on a gap here and then like,

1536
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:09,700
 I came back and it was my son,

1537
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:12,420
 like you wouldn't be like, "How is Africa?"

1538
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:14,540
 Like, "What was your dad?"

1539
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:16,660
 - Alex is so well-traveled.

1540
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:18,540
 Alex and Alex Jr. together.

1541
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:21,120
 (upbeat music)

1542
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:25,780
 - Okay, that is it.

1543
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:26,860
 That is all of our facts.

1544
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:28,220
 Thank you so much for listening.

 And my Instagram is @NoSuchThingAsJamesHarkin.

1551
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:43,940
 - Alex, I don't have any socials at the moment.

1552
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:44,780
 - Yeah?

1553
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:46,460
 - Ooh, look at me.

1554
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:47,540
 - Copycat.

1555
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:48,380
 - Live my life.

1556
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:50,900
 - And Anna, how can they get in touch with all of us?

1557
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:52,540
 - And you can get in touch with all of us
