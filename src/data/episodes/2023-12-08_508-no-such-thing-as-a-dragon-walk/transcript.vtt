00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.640
 Hi everybody, just before we start the show, we want to say a big hi to

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.720
 new listeners coming to us from BBC Sounds, where the podcast now exists.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:17.080
 Welcome to the fold. We are no such thing as a fish. I'm Anna. I'm here with Dan. Hi Dan. Hello.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.880
 What do we do? Yeah, yeah, so there's four of us. We are QI Elbs.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.760
 We are the people who are involved in the TV series QI. And if you enjoy that, if you enjoy all the weird facts,

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:34.360
 this is a real kind of concentrated distilled version of it where we just sit around and share the best, most wonderful,

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.360
 most odd things that we've discovered over the last seven days.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.880
 Yes, and also if you enjoy the occasional incredibly immature sense of humour on QI,

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:49.200
 then you'll get that by the bucket load here. And with a little bit of a warning that there's the occasional bit of adult content.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.760
 So there is swearing, there's the odd adult theme, a little bit of animal sex sometimes makes it in, sometimes a little bit of human

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:02.040
 sex facts make it in, but it's all for the purpose of learning weird, interesting, amazing facts.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:08.120
 And you'll notice we've got 10 episodes up there right now on BBC Sounds and from now on every episode will be published there.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:15.760
 That's right. Now we also just want to quickly address the members, the existing listeners of our show and particularly the members of Club Fish.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.240
 So enjoy and on with the show on with the show.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:23.040
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.320
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.520
 I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Anna Tyshinski and Alex Bell.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.240
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.040
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.960
 Starting with fact number one, that is James.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:46.760
 OK, my fact this week is the artist Goya, who was famously a deaf man, lived in a house called the House of the Deaf Man.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.600
 It was actually named after a different deaf man who lived in that house.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.000
 So first of all, what is Goya's full name?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.280
 Because I think you were practicing.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.960
 Oh, I thought you were calling back something that had happened before.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:06.840
 I was. Yeah, and his full name was Francisco Jose de Goya and Lucien Teff.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.720
 Lovely. Nice. That is a lot less Spanish than I went in the pre-show channel.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.800
 And he is a very famous artist.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:22.120
 He was around in the early 19th century and he's kind of the link between the old masters like Rembrandt and whoever

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.160
 and the modern artists because he was doing lots of satires and lots of incredible stuff.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.000
 He is an absolutely incredible artist.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.640
 He's probably my favorite artist.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.920
 Yeah, I think so. I can actually see why I can connect those two things.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.160
 Oh, yeah. Yeah, we'll get into it. Some of his dark, disturbed, latter paintings.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.320
 But can you please tell us about this?

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.480
 OK, I want to know, did this deaf man name the house after himself, the deaf man?

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.240
 No, it was named by locals as that because this deaf man had lived there

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.640
 and then later Goya moved in there.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.960
 And did he move in there because he was only looking for houses called House for a Deaf Man?

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.480
 Yeah, he actually googled House for a Deaf Man and this is what came up.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.400
 But there was nothing special about the house that made it like accessible for deaf people.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.880
 No, it was a really nice house and he was a former court artist.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.520
 So he had money and had a pension from the monarchy and stuff like that.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.680
 It was also sort of a way from the politics.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.720
 He sort of wanted a place to retreat and sort of get away because he was heavily involved.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.400
 His art would often either do satire or make political statements.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.480
 Yeah, exactly. He thought if he hangs around where the Spanish Inquisition are,

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.800
 then there's a decent chance he might get, you know, so he wanted to get away.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.680
 But one interesting thing about this building is his most famous work for people at home,

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.320
 perhaps, is called Saturn Devouring His Son.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.400
 You might know it.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.840
 It's like a real devilish face and he seems to be biting the head off.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.360
 What could be a chicken or could be his son or something like that?

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.200
 It's a really sort of dark painting.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.600
 It's harrowing. It's like really quite scary.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.880
 Yeah, if you Google it, you'll probably recognize it from memes and stuff.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.960
 But that was.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.160
 But it was on his wall in this house and actually he painted a load of these

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.720
 kind of satirical paintings on the wall of his house.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.200
 And actually they ended up being chipped off because he didn't intend to sell them

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.080
 or anything. They were just murals in his house.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.120
 They're known as the black paintings now. Precisely.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.400
 He have a whole his whole first period of his life was much more involved in politics,

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.160
 like you say, painting on commission for royal courts.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.240
 And there was an awful lot more like of a positive vibe to his painting.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.400
 And then he got really sick and he went deaf as a result of one of his illnesses.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.240
 And then he became very like depressed and obsessed with illness

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.240
 and obsessed with like death and kind of neurotic.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.200
 And these paintings, we think, reflect this dark state that he was in.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.240
 Yeah, they're all really weird and mysterious as well.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.720
 We don't actually know that the painting is called Saturn devouring itself.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.480
 We don't know anything about. We don't think about them.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.960
 Yeah, because like you say, they were all painted on the walls.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.360
 And then the wallpaper had to kind of be chipped away from the wall

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.840
 and then put onto canvas.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.760
 But like a lot of art historians think that like they had to be very

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.200
 significantly altered when that happened.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.840
 Yeah, definitely restoration.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.480
 Yeah, you can spot little bits of it that really they think again,

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.320
 it's almost theory. Is that damage or is that what he intended?

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.000
 There's one called the dog.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.480
 It's basically a landscape where you see a dog's head sticking up

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.480
 at the bottom of the painting.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.200
 And, you know, is he coming over a sort of horizon?

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.000
 Is he coming over a bump in a hill? Is he drowning in quicksand?

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.360
 A lot of people say he's drowning.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.480
 I looked at him and thought, oh, it's like it's like kind of begging.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.800
 Like you get a dog at a table begging,

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.320
 but a lot of people have attempted drowning.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.200
 Yeah, but we have no idea, right? He's never intended anyone to see these.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.120
 These were private kind of things that he did on his wall at home.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.840
 You know, if a kid drills in the wall, they get in trouble, don't they?

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.040
 And yeah, kind of example is that setting.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.840
 You've got to own your own house in order to then make those decisions, right?

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.440
 That's got to imagine if he was renting how pissed off they were.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.520
 You'll not get your deposit back.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.920
 Yeah, so he gave it he gave the house to his grandson

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.040
 and then his grandson sold it to, I don't know, a baron.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.320
 And and then that's the guy who went, let's let's take this off,

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.640
 put this on canvas, donate it to the museums.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.400
 The dog in particular in the museum where it is,

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.960
 the curator of that museum says that there's not a single contemporary painter

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.480
 in the world who does not pray in front of the dog.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.600
 It's that important. Oh, yeah.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.560
 I've got to say, the dog doesn't impress me as the guy.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.360
 I like I think some of the others are better.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.000
 Really is a big dog doesn't put anything out.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.960
 It's like, it's a massive portrait shaped vertical painting.

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.080
 The dog's right in the bottom and most of it's just brown.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.000
 Like 95 percent of it is just brown.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.800
 Once you learn about Maljevic, by the way, who's painting is just black.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.440
 It's like literally just a black square.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.440
 Right. Yeah, if you don't like something that's 90 percent brown,

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.960
 you're not going to like that.

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.560
 I think the only reason people like the dogs

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.200
 is because you've filed through these like witches and decapitated,

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.600
 bloodied people tear each other to shreds and then you've got a little black dog.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.560
 People love animals.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.400
 Yeah, people love animals.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.520
 He knew the tick tock generation was coming up.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.200
 He knew memes were on the way.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.200
 He's so clever. It's actually doge, isn't it?

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.080
 So there's so much written about his art

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.880
 and the interpretations of it, but what do we know about Goya the man?

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.720
 Here's a few things that we know.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.200
 Are you presenting a documentary?

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.200
 I thought you were on the South Bank show for a second.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.400
 It really felt like I was Melvin Bragg all of a sudden.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.160
 The smell of orange. Love the smell of orange.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.680
 Oh, yeah. Yeah.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:08.400
 The smell of a girl's armpit loved it as long as it had an orange.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.880
 You get this like a dating profile, right?

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:15.880
 Well, this is the whiff of tobacco, the aftertaste of wine

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.840
 and the twanging rhythms of a street dance.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.600
 This is all according to a biography that was written about him.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.320
 Is it according to him himself?

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:26.200
 Because it feels like, OK, he wrote this down somewhere.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.440
 It wasn't someone going, he seems like the kind of guy

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.320
 who loves sniffing girls armpits.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.720
 Let's put that in. Yeah, I love the smell of an orange.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:35.320
 Like, who doesn't like orange is generally pleasant.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.760
 Why would you like note that down?

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.440
 Well, maybe he chucked the orange thing in there

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.200
 to make up for the weirdness of the girls armpits so that there was.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.520
 Yeah, I'm not totally crazy.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.280
 I like normal things, too.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.000
 He was the first major artist to paint a woman entirely nude

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.040
 in a profane style, as in the this was the one

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.840
 that he got summoned by the inquisition.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.560
 Yeah, so profane means not religious.

00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:00.000
 And this was the naked maca.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.560
 Yes, it was deemed, I think, indecent

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.320
 and prejudicial to the common good.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.760
 So, yeah, and I didn't know what a maca was,

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.720
 but machos and machas were according to the New Yorker.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:13.720
 This is how New Yorker described them flamboyantly cheeky, lower class dandies.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.960
 And that's what I've got on my dating profile.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:21.720
 Lower class, please, the other way you talk, Alex.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:25.360
 But yeah, I got summoned by the inquisition

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.200
 and I just find his tangles with the inquisition quite bizarre.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.240
 Yeah, so weird.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.080
 Well, who knew the inquisition was still bloody

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.840
 happening the start of the 19th century?

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.360
 Are they lasted for ages, didn't they?

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.880
 It lasted ridiculously long.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.920
 It's practically going since late medieval times.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.840
 And still they're struggling on clinging on.

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.720
 I think they were quite toothless by then.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.120
 Python sketch was topical.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.200
 Yeah, but he did.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.280
 He got away with it with the naked painting.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.680
 I believe by saying, well, if you think this was gross,

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:53.040
 then you're condemning your former king because he said

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.440
 he was emulating a Velasquez painting

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.640
 and that Philip the Fourth of Spain had loved.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:02.200
 So he was going, well, your king loved this, basically, your dead king.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.400
 So what are you going to do?

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.400
 Well, the interesting thing I think about the naked

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.240
 maha is that he gave it or sold it, I should say, to Godoy,

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.440
 who was the prime minister of Spain at the time.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:16.480
 And the story goes that we know that Goya made two versions,

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.840
 the naked maha and the not-naked maha, the clothed maha,

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.600
 you might call it.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:26.160
 And the prime minister supposedly kept the clothed one on display.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.400
 And whenever his friends would come round after a few whiskeys,

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:33.040
 he would say, look at this, and he would pull like a secret lever

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.320
 and the wall would spin round and the naked one would come out.

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.520
 That's like one of those pens where you turn it upside down.

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.320
 It's actually so tacky.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.120
 Well, that's the story, and that's supposedly what happened.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:47.640
 But for sure, the reason that he got brought in front of the Inquisition,

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:51.520
 Goya is because Godoy was actually really controversial,

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:52.800
 because he was the prime minister.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.240
 And this was one of the really controversial things that he did,

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.200
 having this terrible painting.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.040
 And it was Goya kind of got pulled into the Inquisition

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:01.640
 because they were going after Godoy.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.280
 Really? That's amazing.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:07.360
 It's a painting that has caused controversy for not just his period,

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.920
 but well long after his death.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:12.480
 The 155 years well long. Well long, man.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:17.560
 Bare long. He used to say people used to go to Godoy's house and go,

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:20.840
 that is a bad good painting. Do you think this is bad good?

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:28.680
 So many, many years later, it's issued in Spain as a stamp.

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:33.560
 And this is suddenly the first stamp where there's a naked woman on a stamp.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.400
 And in American, this is 1959, they banned it.

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:40.880
 So any letters that came into America, they said, we will not forward them on.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:44.200
 There are a few cases where at the post office, they would actually just,

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.760
 you know, they'd scrawled up the stamp, scrawled it over and stuff like that

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.320
 and then send it on. But it was a huge, huge problem.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:53.080
 That's amazing. Yeah, the letters returned because of, yeah.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:56.280
 It's a time magazine wrote, an indecent picture is bad enough,

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:59.040
 but a postage stamp whose backside must be licked.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:02.400
 Millions of millions of innocent children collect stamps.

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:05.920
 And so, yeah, and there were certain places that kind of allowed it.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.400
 But eventually they did ban it entirely.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:10.040
 It didn't have a picture of her bum on the back that you could lick, did it?

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.240
 No.

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.800
 So we don't know who the woman is in that painting,

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:18.160
 but there's a pretty good chance that it's at least partly based on the duchess

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.680
 of Alba, who was supposedly Gaius Mistras.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.200
 They were definitely very good friends.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.720
 We're not sure if they were.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:28.720
 But they were definitely good mates.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:32.080
 That sounded like an event.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.560
 They looked after a small bird together.

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.920
 That sounded like an actual censor on our show that you said a swear word.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.560
 And it's now been whistled over.

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:43.960
 I thought now that we're possibly going on BBC Sounds, that I should not be saying fucking.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.400
 Yeah, true.

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.200
 Anyway, the duchess of Alba's full name, actually,

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:53.560
 was Donia Maria Dalpila Tareza, Caetana de Silva, Alvarez de Toledo

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:58.040
 and Silva Bazan, Decimo Tercera Duchesa de Alba de Tomes,

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:03.080
 Decimo Premiera Duchesa de Hosca, Sexta Duchesa de Montero,

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:08.800
 Octava Candesa Duchesa de Alvarez, Decimo Premiera Marquiza del Capio,

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:14.120
 Decimo Tercera Marquiza de Coria, Noneba Novena, I won't do them all.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:17.240
 It's 754 letters in total.

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:19.600
 Her full name was.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.480
 Either we have to say this fact or we have to say all the other factors.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:28.200
 So, yeah, and her descendant, who died in 2014,

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.400
 who was actually a quite famous duchess of Alba, the one who was in the painting

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:35.320
 was a 13th and the one who died in 2014 was in the Guinness World Records

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:38.080
 as the aristocrat with most titles.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.640
 She was a bit of an eccentric.

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:44.640
 Yeah, and the duchess of Alba, who's in the painting.

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:47.680
 There's interesting thing about her is she was one of the most powerful people

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:51.280
 because she was also supposedly the mistress of Godoy, the prime minister.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:55.320
 But she had a bit of a beef with Maria Louisa,

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:58.400
 who was the queen consort who was married to Charles IV.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.320
 These were the two most powerful women

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.480
 and they really, really hated each other.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:06.040
 And one day the queen consort was going to go to a party

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:09.440
 and the duchess of Alba found out what she was going to wear

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:14.080
 and got all of her maids to wear exactly the same clothes as the Countess

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.520
 and go to the party.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:19.160
 So suddenly there were like 20 women all wearing exactly the same clothes.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.040
 That could be seen as flattery.

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.000
 It wasn't. It was seen as famously women.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.800
 Hey, that it was seen as a massive, massive slap.

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:30.120
 Do they women you say they don't like that?

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:34.840
 It was seen as a massive, massive slam, so much so that we think

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:38.640
 that the queen consort had the duchess of Alba murdered for that.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.280
 Oh, wow. Wow.

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.000
 For getting her maids to wear the same clothes.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.320
 That is a magical joke on wrong.

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:46.400
 Yeah. So I'm now terrified because sometimes me and Anne come

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:50.000
 into the office wearing the same jumper with a cuddly animal featured on the front.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.440
 Yeah. Do you think she's plotting my demise?

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.920
 I feel like she might be.

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:55.200
 Actually, they exhumed her body in 1945.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.200
 They think she probably died.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.200
 Yeah.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:03.160
 She probably died of meningitis, we think, after being murdered.

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.120
 But that was the story for hundreds of years.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.600
 That's what happened. That's amazing.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:10.720
 The number of paintings by Goya is going down and down by the day.

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:11.960
 Right. It's a real.

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.960
 I'd be more surprised if it was going up.

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:20.360
 I suppose sometimes you find paint.

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:21.520
 No, that is true.

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.240
 You do just got the lost paintings.

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.200
 You might have had another like a shed or something

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.920
 that he painted all over that we haven't discovered yet.

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:27.440
 Absolutely.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.800
 You might have had a second home that he rented out as an Airbnb,

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.280
 but then it turns out that it had paintings on it.

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:34.000
 Yeah. But none of these things are true.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:34.920
 That's what we're saying.

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:37.000
 Well, I think what we're saying is we don't know.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:37.880
 We just don't know.

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:41.160
 If you're staying in an Airbnb with disturbing paintings on the wall,

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.840
 get in touch. That's about every Airbnb.

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.680
 We haven't stayed in like a tastefully decorated Airbnb.

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:49.080
 You need to up your budget very slightly at least.

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:51.080
 It's a lower class Gabby.

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:56.440
 So this is because basically lots of paintings

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:58.920
 that we thought were by him turn out not to be by him.

00:15:58.920 --> 00:15:59.400
 Oh, really?

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:01.800
 And when, you know, modern analysis is done,

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.800
 it looks very closely at brushstrokes

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.760
 and the type of materials that we used

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.200
 and they make certain deductions.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.400
 I'm always skeptical, you know.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:12.360
 So there's actually one of his most famous paintings, Colossus.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.880
 They now think was not painted by him.

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:17.680
 And there's one expert called Manuela Mena.

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.360
 And she says that the brushstrokes are inferior

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:21.600
 to what he would have done.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.200
 You can tell that the confidence with which they were made

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.120
 is not an expert.

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.240
 And you think he could just be having a bad day?

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.040
 Can I just say, if people in the like 200 years,

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:33.200
 they listened to episode 183 of the podcast,

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.680
 they weren't very funny in that one.

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.280
 So I don't think it was them.

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:40.080
 That's that AI thing jumping over their voices.

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:47.480
 OK, it is time for fact number two.

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:48.640
 And that is my fact.

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.720
 My fact this week is that before governments

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.360
 experienced cyber attacks,

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:55.200
 they had to deal with fax attacks.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.920
 Oh, what a great name.

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.160
 Alternative podcast.

00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:58.840
 Fax attack.

00:16:58.840 --> 00:16:59.600
 Fax attack.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:01.480
 Oh, yeah, that's true, yeah.

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.840
 So this is a thing that's called a black fax.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.360
 And people would do this as pranks,

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:07.560
 but they would do it to companies that they hated.

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:08.880
 They would do it to governments

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:12.760
 where they would basically send over black paper from their side.

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:14.880
 And often they would do, they would loop it around.

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:18.160
 So their fax machine was just sort of eternally

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.960
 sending a fully black page.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:20.680
 Like a conveyor belt.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.120
 Like a conveyor belt, exactly.

00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:23.760
 And so the people receiving it,

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.480
 if they were not near their fax machine,

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.040
 suddenly they would be using all the ink up

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:31.160
 or they might even heat the machine up so much

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.760
 because so much of it was processing the load ages.

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:35.760
 It would overload and it would sort of just.

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:37.920
 I suppose also means you can't use the fax

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.280
 while that's happening. Exactly.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:40.880
 We should say, because people will write in,

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:43.360
 probably not ink so much as thermal paper.

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:44.520
 Yes, sorry, yes.

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:47.320
 But I love already the people who would have written in

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:48.280
 to complain about that.

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:49.720
 I'm sorry we corrected ourselves

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.000
 because I want to know you better.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.400
 Send your faxes to podcast@qi.com.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.320
 So yeah, it's a method that was done

00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:00.920
 and it was done, you know, before cybercrime.

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.880
 If we're being sort of talking about it loosely

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:07.360
 because there are always examples of like the 1700s,

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:08.360
 a version of cyber attack.

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:10.600
 Yeah, they say the first one was like 1834,

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:11.680
 it was supposed to be the first cyber crime.

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:12.520
 What was that then?

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:14.000
 Well, it was in France

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.880
 and it was obviously before the internet was invented

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:19.280
 and it was a way of, sorry.

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:21.040
 Because these days, they might not know.

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:27.360
 In those days, financial market data was,

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:28.400
 like trading was happening,

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.680
 but it was sort of done via like letter.

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.400
 So if you were in a different town,

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.480
 like the information would travel quite slowly

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:35.600
 and people were always trying to find a way

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:36.440
 to beat that information

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:37.840
 and people tried like carrier pigeons

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:39.080
 and all sorts of stuff like this.

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:40.480
 But one way it wasn't communicated

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:41.320
 was the telegraph system,

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.080
 which was used for other things.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.040
 But these two brothers, the Blanc brothers,

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:49.240
 they set up a ruse with some of the telegraph

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:50.680
 operators where they smuggled

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:53.040
 little information indicators in other messages.

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.960
 But the way the hack worked was that

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:56.760
 the information would be like a single character,

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.800
 like I suppose U for up or D for down

00:18:58.800 --> 00:18:59.640
 or something like that

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.560
 to indicate something to do with the stock market.

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:02.560
 But then if you followed that

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:03.680
 with a backspace character,

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.120
 it meant that it wouldn't get written down

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:06.840
 'cause it would be regarded as a mistake.

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:08.760
 But the telegraph operator would see it all.

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:09.720
 So if they were in on it,

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.080
 they could write down and be like,

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:12.440
 "Yeah, it's sent over as a mistake,

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:13.280
 we're not writing it down,

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:14.120
 but this is the information."

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.000
 And the idea being that you know

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.280
 if the price of gold has gone down

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.800
 you could sell it for anyone else.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:20.640
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:21.480
 Yeah, yeah.

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:22.320
 - That's clever.

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.480
 Do you think, obviously,

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:24.960
 who was the modern artist we mentioned earlier?

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:26.640
 Was it Roscoe who did all the black paintings?

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:27.480
 - Oh, Maljevic.

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:28.800
 - There's Maljevic.

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:30.440
 All good when he tries to fax the photos

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:32.640
 of his new artworks crew.

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.160
 I keep trying to send it to you.

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:35.000
 What?

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.560
 Stop pranking us.

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:37.400
 - It's twice worth so much,

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:38.720
 it's just the ink.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.080
 - No, it's not black.

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.480
 It's the Duchess of Alba's name

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:42.640
 in very small fonts.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:46.200
 (all laughing)

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.080
 - Do you know who, as of 2017,

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:49.160
 so I don't know if it's changed,

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.040
 but the last report that I saw, 2017,

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:55.440
 was the biggest purchasers of fax machines in the UK.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.280
 - NHS.

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:57.120
 - NHS.

00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:57.960
 - It's the NHS.

00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:58.800
 - Yeah.

00:19:58.800 --> 00:19:59.920
 - Yeah, so interesting.

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:02.440
 - They've really phased it out since then.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.280
 I think, haven't they?

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.600
 There was a big scandal a couple of years ago.

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:05.440
 - Yeah, it was controversial, I remember.

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:06.680
 - They were like, "We've got to stop."

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:07.520
 - Yeah.

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:08.360
 (all laughing)

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:09.480
 - Yeah, and pages as well, wasn't it?

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:10.320
 - Yeah.

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.440
 - I think they decided they wanted to get rid of them all.

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:14.680
 - Also, the NHS still have a big dictaphone tradition,

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:16.280
 where a lot of the older doctors still,

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:17.280
 instead of--

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.640
 - Why don't they just use their fingers?

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:21.220
 (all laughing)

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.320
 - That's one of my favorite jokes.

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:25.280
 - It's really a joke, it's a great joke.

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:26.120
 It's great.

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.240
 - Sorry, as you were saying.

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.000
 - No, just that loads of doctors still

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.960
 will be able to log in to the usual NHS account,

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:31.800
 and when you go to the doctor,

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:32.640
 they'll make your medical notes

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.360
 and just put them into the system.

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:37.520
 A lot of older doctors still prefer to use dictaphones,

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:40.040
 i.e. manual dictaphones with actual tape cassette tapes

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.240
 inside, dictate the notes,

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.520
 and then they're sent away

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.080
 to a third-party transcription service,

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:46.160
 and then the notes are sent back,

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.120
 and then the doctors then check them,

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:49.040
 like the written notes,

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.160
 and then they're inputted to the system

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.000
 by someone else,

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.560
 and it's an insanely inefficient system.

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:54.200
 - You've got to feel bad about that,

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.400
 surely, doctors. - Yeah, it's ridiculous.

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.280
 - Miley Cyrus uses fax machines.

00:20:58.280 --> 00:20:59.120
 - Okay.

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:00.360
 - Is this-- - What for?

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.200
 - For communicating?

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.400
 - Everything, really.

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.400
 - No, only with one person.

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:07.720
 She uses them to communicate with her godmother,

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.800
 Dolly Parton, because Dolly Parton

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:11.480
 actually does use them for everything.

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:12.320
 - Why?

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:14.520
 - She refuses to use text messaging,

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:16.800
 and instead uses a fax machine for everything.

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:17.640
 - Really? - Yeah.

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:18.480
 - You really buried the lead there,

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:19.880
 but you were trying to get the kids in by saying,

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:22.480
 "Miley Cyrus uses sometimes his fax machine

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:23.680
 "for Dolly Parton, that's amazing."

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:24.800
 - Yeah, Dolly said,

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:26.200
 "I don't want to talk to everyone

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.720
 "that wants to talk to me.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:30.720
 "I don't text 'cause I don't want to have to answer."

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:32.120
 So she thinks if people text her,

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:33.360
 she'd have to reply all the time,

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.320
 but with a fax machine,

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.120
 she can just, like, get the messages and then--

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.360
 - Yeah, it's very indirect.

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.200
 You can't do the three dots thing,

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.760
 or you don't get seen on a fax.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:43.560
 - Yeah, but then it's still indirect this way,

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:47.240
 because Miley Cyrus says that she doesn't really fax.

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.480
 She has a phone.

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:51.520
 What happens is Dolly Parton sends a fax,

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:53.720
 then somebody at the other end scans the fax

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:54.640
 to see what it says,

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.280
 and then writes it in a text message

00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:58.840
 that gets sent to Miley Cyrus.

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:00.680
 - Actually, the real leader of this fax

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:03.120
 is that somebody's job is sorting communications

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.360
 between Miley Cyrus and Dolly Parton exclusively.

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.040
 - Are you telling me you don't want that job?

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.800
 - Of course I want that job.

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:09.720
 - It must happen a lot.

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.280
 I mentioned years ago on the podcast

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.840
 that's how Brian Blessed would do his tweets.

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.520
 So, yeah, it's the exact same thing.

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:19.840
 He would be sent the tweets to reply to, to his agent,

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.440
 fax it to him, he would fax back.

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:22.600
 Like, there was a whole fax system.

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:24.480
 - Did he write out the replies by hand,

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:25.560
 which would then fax back,

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:26.400
 and then there would be times--

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.240
 - I can't remember now, yeah.

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:28.320
 - It went through, like, eight different modes

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.160
 of communication.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.160
 - There was a lot, but maybe that's more,

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:33.160
 it can't just be Dolly and Brian Blessed.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:35.400
 - Brian Blessed once tweet Miley Cyrus saying,

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:38.960
 "Can you tell Dolly Parton to answer her phone?"

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:40.840
 - I think it all had to go through the NHS in the end,

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:43.160
 that was where you were.

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:45.960
 - Have you heard of the fax number of the beast?

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.880
 - Okay, six, six, six, something.

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.680
 - It's six, six, seven.

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.640
 And it's quite just a little nice nugget

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:53.760
 for phone numbers of faxes.

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.960
 - Oh, 'cause of course your fax number used to be

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:58.240
 your phone number, but with one digit at the end,

00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.080
 gone one up.

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:00.560
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:01.400
 Yeah, yeah.

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.520
 So, six, six, seven is the fax number of the beast.

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:04.360
 - Oh, I see.

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:06.880
 - I'm sorry, according to people who--

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:07.720
 - I think it's a joke, right?

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:08.560
 It's a little joke.

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:09.400
 - It's a joke.

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:10.240
 - Yeah, yeah, it's a joke, yeah.

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.080
 - Yeah, no, nice.

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:11.920
 I like, sorry.

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:12.760
 (laughing)

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:14.080
 I like jokes.

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.480
 I'm the joke guy.

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:21.360
 - Before we had cyber, let's say urban legends

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:24.200
 being sent through email and Facebook and stuff like that,

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.600
 they were all done on fax machines.

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:30.320
 And in 1993, there was a big scare in Memphis, Tennessee

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:32.880
 because there was a load of faxes going around

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:36.520
 about gangs would drive around with the lights off

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:38.960
 in the cars, and if anyone flashed them to tell them

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.840
 their lights were off, then they would chase them,

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:43.400
 stop them, and kill them.

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.240
 And obviously--

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.080
 - Oh my God, was this not true?

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.900
 'Cause I heard this rumor quite recently.

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:48.640
 - It's just got to Anna's fax.

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:50.640
 - I mean, that still goes around that rumor, right?

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.160
 But no, it is fake.

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.160
 - But it was called fax law,

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.760
 the culture of sending faxes around,

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:56.520
 and it was the old meme culture, I think.

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:57.360
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:59.520
 And when emails came along,

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:03.120
 it just went from fax to email directly from there to there.

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:05.200
 - So, fax law was the name for the rumors,

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.040
 the lies that were started.

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.200
 - Yeah, like folklore.

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.040
 - Oh wow.

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:08.880
 - I thank you.

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:12.000
 Again, I now get that that's a joke, fax law,

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:12.840
 to play on words.

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:13.840
 - She likes jokes.

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:14.680
 - She loves jokes.

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:15.520
 - Ladies and gentlemen.

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:16.840
 - I'm a joke, aren't I?

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:18.920
 - Oh, the last time I came on this podcast.

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:23.840
 - Do you know who else used to fax each other

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:24.680
 in the '80s?

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:25.520
 Well, loads of people.

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:26.360
 - Give us a list.

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:27.680
 - I'll give you a list.

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:29.280
 - I framed that question badly.

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:31.160
 I've got a better way of framing it.

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:33.120
 What was the, and pretend that,

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:34.240
 I didn't ask that previous question,

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:35.600
 'cause otherwise it'll give it away,

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:38.240
 what was the hotline between the White House

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:39.640
 and the Kremlin?

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.120
 - Was it a fax machine?

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:43.520
 - Dunno, I know you cheated there.

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:45.680
 Probably using previous information.

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.600
 - I always thought it was a red telephone.

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:48.800
 - It wasn't, a phone.

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.360
 - That's Batman you're thinking of.

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:55.080
 - I think that was part of where the rumor came from

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:56.080
 that the hotline was a phone,

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:58.240
 'cause I think it was in one of the Batman films

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.000
 who speaks to the White House on the phone.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.520
 Anyway, the hotline between the White House

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:04.080
 and the Kremlin famously started by Kennedy

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:06.320
 and Khrushchev in the '60s,

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.680
 was never a telephone between them,

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:11.040
 but it was in the '80s a fax machine.

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:14.080
 So it started with type, so it was teletype,

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:17.040
 so it was basically like an old version of text

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.840
 where you'd type a message if you're in the White House

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:21.600
 or in fact in the Pentagon where it was.

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.680
 You'd type a message, it would be encrypted by people,

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:26.280
 sent to the Kremlin and then translated

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:28.200
 by someone at the other end into Russian.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.880
 And it was quite sweet.

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:31.040
 The start of the Cold War,

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:33.120
 they swapped machines for this teletyping.

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:35.480
 So the Kremlin posted to the US

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.480
 four of their teletype machines

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.080
 that could print stuff out in Cyrillic,

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:40.960
 and the US posted back to the Kremlin

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.200
 four of their machines.

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:45.040
 And they upgraded to fax machines in the '80s.

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:47.240
 So in the 1980s, if there was an emergency

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:50.280
 between Reagan and Gorbachev,

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:51.320
 then they faxed each other.

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.520
 - There's many ways that people have to protect themselves

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:55.600
 against cyber attacks these days.

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.320
 What do you reckon, this is now turning just into a quiz,

00:25:58.320 --> 00:25:59.720
 the answer is not fax machine.

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:00.920
 (laughing)

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:04.200
 What do you reckon, so like for the Navy,

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:07.120
 how they get by if they get cyber attacked

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:10.800
 for let's say their GPS system is hit with malware

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.720
 from an unknown enemy and that's how they're scrambled.

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.560
 - Okay, so you need to know which way to go,

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:17.200
 but your GPS is broken 'cause you've been hit by cyber.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.880
 - Yep, you pop up and look at the stars in your periscope.

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:20.720
 - That's what it is.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:21.560
 - Oh shit, sorry.

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:23.080
 - Celestial navigation.

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:25.120
 They're all taught celestial navigation, yeah.

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.920
 - I'd make such a great submarine captain

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:29.440
 'cause that was my first thought and I was like,

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:31.560
 I mean, I wouldn't know how to do it, but like.

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:34.600
 - Someone used to celestially navigate, thanks Alex.

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:35.960
 - That's why the captain's there.

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:36.800
 - There's no such captain, I'm in charge,

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:37.640
 I'm not actually doing anything,

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:39.480
 I'm just telling you what to do, right Anna?

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:40.920
 But like, think about how quickly

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.040
 I made that decision and who's right what.

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:44.040
 - Uh, go on.

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.120
 - No, no, it wasn't funny.

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.920
 - Oh, as she knows funny.

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:50.180
 (laughing)

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:55.280
 - So, we mentioned the number of the beast earlier on.

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.120
 - Yes.

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:56.960
 - I've got a little quiz for you.

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:57.800
 - Oh, great.

00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:58.920
 - Are the following things,

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:00.480
 are the names of cyber attacks

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:03.140
 or the names of bands who have opened for Iron Maiden?

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:05.160
 (laughing)

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:07.760
 Let's go for Shady Rat.

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:09.680
 - Shady Rat's a band surely.

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:10.520
 - Yeah, cyber attack.

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:11.360
 - I'm gonna go cyber attack.

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:12.400
 - It's a cyber attack.

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:13.240
 - Wow.

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:15.040
 - In fact, it was a series of cyber attacks

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:18.280
 in the late 2000s, originated from China.

00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:20.720
 Night Dragon.

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:21.560
 - Cyber attack.

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:22.960
 - Band, cyber attack.

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:24.480
 - Oh, Dan, you suck at this so badly.

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.720
 (laughing)

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:27.360
 Around the same time as Shady Rat,

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:30.160
 these were attacks on energy companies.

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.680
 Nitro's use.

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.640
 - Cyber attack.

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:33.720
 - I'm gonna go band this time.

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:34.540
 - Band.

00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:35.380
 - Cyber attack.

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:36.720
 (laughing)

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:39.040
 - I don't know how my brain works.

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:40.560
 - Everyone knows Iron Maiden have a policy

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:42.080
 of never having a supporting act.

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:44.840
 (laughing)

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:47.480
 - These were attacks on Iran by the US

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:49.800
 that were planned if nuclear talks failed.

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:54.300
 Let's go for Vinnie Vincent's invasion.

00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:55.880
 (laughing)

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:56.800
 - I'm gonna say it's a band.

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:57.640
 Surely it's a band.

00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:58.480
 - Yeah.

00:27:58.480 --> 00:27:59.320
 - That.

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:00.160
 - Band.

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:01.000
 (laughing)

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.320
 - I am gonna say cyber attack.

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:03.600
 - Oh, I know you've lost it.

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.880
 (cheering)

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.440
 - I actually run out of cyber attacks now.

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:08.600
 I did the ball at the top.

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:09.960
 (laughing)

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:13.240
 - I was looking at other like kind of non-digital ways

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:14.360
 of hacking things.

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:17.220
 And did you, have you heard of token suckers?

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:18.200
 So this was for many years,

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:19.920
 the New York subway ran on tokens.

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:23.080
 It was, you would buy tokens which would go into the slots

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:23.920
 to let you through the barriers.

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:25.440
 And it was because I think the denominations

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:27.840
 of coins never always matched up with the fares.

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:29.480
 And there were people called token suckers

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:32.520
 who would steal tokens by jamming up the slots

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:33.700
 in the machine with a bit of paper

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:35.240
 so that when people put their token in,

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:36.800
 they'd lose it, but it wouldn't go all the way in.

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:38.640
 And then they would come back and they would

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.720
 just crash down and suck the token out.

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:41.560
 - With their mouth.

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:42.400
 - With their mouth.

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:43.240
 - Really?

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.080
 - Yeah.

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:44.920
 - It's a hell of a vacuum you've got on your mouth

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:46.000
 if you can suck a coin out of a slot.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.360
 - Yeah, I think if it's just inside,

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:49.100
 you can kind of try and get it.

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:51.720
 - Maybe use your tongue to just soft wiggle it.

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:52.540
 - Yeah.

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:53.680
 - You could take a hoover,

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:55.240
 you could take a vacuum cleaner to the station.

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:56.080
 - Like a dice.

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:56.900
 - A little more suspicious, but yeah.

00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:57.740
 - I think you've had a tax attention.

00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:59.840
 But they used to, some of the subway station attendants

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:02.800
 would put chili powder in the slots as a deterrent,

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:03.640
 which is nice.

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:04.720
 - Yeah, that's nice.

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:07.040
 - You could get half a tennis ball and stick it on

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:09.160
 and then wham it and that creates a vacuum

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:10.520
 and then when you pull it off, it would suck it.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:11.360
 - Really?

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:12.200
 - Yeah.

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:13.020
 - That's good.

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:13.840
 - Or play at any plunger, I guess.

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:15.000
 - Plunger would do the same job.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.320
 (laughing)

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.160
 - That was made twice, yeah?

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.740
 (upbeat music)

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:23.900
 (upbeat music)

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:26.220
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:27.940
 and that is Anna.

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:30.740
 - My fact this week is that for 200 years,

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:34.780
 humans made wire by soaking steel in urine,

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:37.240
 but for realizing that water works just as well.

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:38.620
 (laughing)

00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:40.260
 - We're so stupid.

00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:41.100
 - I love it.

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:41.940
 - How recent was this?

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:43.140
 It's just like last year we weren't the same.

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:47.420
 - Yeah, someone squatting down to urinate on the steel again

00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:50.620
 saying, "We definitely not just put it under the towel."

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:52.180
 - What was the thought behind it?

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:54.300
 - Well, I read this in a great book actually called

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:56.020
 How to Invent Everything,

00:29:56.020 --> 00:30:00.140
 and the thought I think was that urine was used

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:03.140
 for various things historically, wasn't it?

00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:04.540
 The tanning industry springs to mind,

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:05.940
 but going through the podcast archive,

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:07.700
 it was used for millions of other things,

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:11.780
 and so this was in Altena in Germany,

00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:13.940
 and it was in 1650,

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:17.500
 and at that point to make wire out of steel,

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.300
 you had to pull a steel rod,

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:21.380
 so like a thicker rod of steel,

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:24.140
 through a funnel of decreasing diameter,

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:25.900
 so you know like when you did filtration in science,

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:26.740
 you had those funnels,

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:28.780
 and so you'd put steel in the wide end,

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:31.580
 and you drag it through until it gets thinner and thinner,

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:33.940
 and then you get a thin wire coming out the other end,

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:35.700
 and to stop there being too much friction,

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:37.420
 'cause you're putting it through really hard,

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:38.780
 you use grease or oil,

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:41.580
 and then in this place called Altena in Germany,

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:44.500
 someone, according to reports from the time,

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:47.620
 accidentally sort of urinated all over it,

00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:48.980
 and then tried it,

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:52.940
 and found that it works just as well as the grease and oil,

00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:54.460
 and so I thought, oh, it must be something special

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:55.300
 about the wee.

00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:58.220
 - I believe, I found something from quite near the time

00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:01.780
 that said that this guy who's called Johann Gerdis,

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:06.860
 he had been so annoyed that he couldn't draw it well enough

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:09.620
 that he'd thrown his material,

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:13.140
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:13.980
 - Yes.

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:15.340
 - Which is where everyone casts their water,

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:16.540
 so he didn't urinate on it,

00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:18.380
 he got annoyed and threw it in the corner

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:19.940
 into the tile and that's where.

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:22.540
 - Yeah, exactly, so he tossed it into the loo,

00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:24.700
 and then he thought, oh no, that was,

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:26.660
 I threw a strop there, that was silly, wasn't I?

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:27.820
 But I'll go and get it back,

00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:30.020
 and so then he went and sort of got my elbow deep.

00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:31.340
 - Pissy metal back.

00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:34.620
 - Exactly, climbed down into the vat of wee,

00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:36.020
 got it back out,

00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:38.940
 and then found that it works better, and--

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:39.780
 - And when you say work better,

00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:41.660
 is it just softer and more malleable?

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:43.060
 - Yeah, so what it seemed to do,

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:46.380
 what it did do is make a soft coating around the metal,

00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:48.460
 which reduces the friction when you pull it through.

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:51.140
 Now, we now do know that water also does that,

00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:52.740
 but for 200 years,

00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:53.940
 people who worked in this factory

00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:55.380
 would provide urine to it,

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:56.580
 and actually their wives and children

00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:59.020
 would also donate their urine to this factory.

00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:00.860
 - I like the fact that they,

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:03.500
 in between the wee and the water,

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:05.420
 they worked out that beer worked.

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:06.260
 - Really?

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:08.060
 - So they did it with the wee for ages,

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:10.380
 and then after about 100 years, someone tried beer,

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:11.940
 they went, oh, this works just as well.

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:12.780
 - That's so good.

00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:13.620
 - We don't need to whistle it.

00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:16.180
 - Stop trying, try like 100 different things, yeah?

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:17.020
 - Maybe they did.

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:18.060
 - I kind of wonder what else would work

00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:19.300
 that we haven't thought of yet.

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:20.140
 - Yeah.

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:20.980
 - Better than water.

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:22.220
 - I think once you've got to water,

00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:24.460
 it's like, okay, good, this is a simplest trick.

00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:26.140
 - I so love to have been there on the day

00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:28.180
 that the person who came into town and said,

00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:29.700
 you know you can just use water,

00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:31.740
 so they've said that, so can you?

00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:32.940
 - Or like, dicks in hands.

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:34.700
 (all laughing)

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:36.020
 - Standing here, dick in hand.

00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:39.340
 (all laughing)

00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:40.660
 - You've been so embarrassed.

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:41.620
 How long have you been doing this?

00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:43.460
 200 years.

00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:46.900
 - It's not important, doesn't matter.

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:47.940
 - Yeah.

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:48.780
 - Wow.

00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:50.620
 - I think it's also interesting that you make,

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:52.060
 why I like you make spaghetti,

00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:53.820
 you just squeeze it in a,

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:55.020
 I mean, it might have pissed off my spaghetti.

00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:57.380
 I mean, squeezing it through, squeezing it through her face.

00:32:57.380 --> 00:32:58.500
 - Actually, if you could get it in water,

00:32:58.500 --> 00:32:59.340
 it's even better.

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:02.740
 (all laughing)

00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:05.020
 - You know that smell that iron and steel has,

00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:06.300
 like doorknobs and stuff, you know that?

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:07.140
 - Oh yeah.

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:07.980
 - That smell.

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:08.820
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:09.660
 - The metal smell.

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:10.500
 - So you actually don't,

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:12.460
 because it turns out that it doesn't smell,

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:13.780
 and you know what it actually is,

00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:17.420
 is the oils and chemicals excreted by you,

00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:19.740
 reacting with the surface of the metal.

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:20.580
 - Very similarly,

00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:21.940
 and every kitchen should have this,

00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:23.060
 I don't have this,

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:25.980
 but you can get stainless steel soap.

00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:27.220
 And I've never heard of that before.

00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:28.060
 - Oh.

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:28.900
 - Yeah.

00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:29.740
 - What?

00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:30.580
 - Yeah.

00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:31.420
 - Well, 'cause stainless steel is like antibacterial, right?

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:32.500
 Which is why, like a lot of doorknobs are made out of it,

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:33.660
 and especially when you go into public toilets

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:35.140
 and stuff, everything's metal.

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:35.980
 - Yeah.

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:37.300
 - 'Cause bacteria can't last very long.

00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:38.620
 - So you don't need to wash your hands

00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:39.460
 when you're leaving the loo.

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:41.500
 You just turn the metal doorknob and you say,

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:42.660
 "I've done it, as long as you do it both hands."

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:44.140
 - You're not made of metal, Adam.

00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:45.900
 (all laughing)

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:47.540
 - Now, this is specifically for,

00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:49.700
 if you're cutting up onions or you're cutting up garlic,

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:52.340
 and the smell gets stuck to your fingers,

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:54.140
 and you're like, "Oh, God, I smell of this."

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:56.420
 Rubbing your hands against stainless steel

00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:59.260
 creates a reaction that knocks out the smell from it.

00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:02.540
 This is, I don't think it's scientifically proven at all,

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:05.820
 but they do sell, as it were, bars of stainless steel soap.

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:07.700
 - I actually think it is scientifically proven.

00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:08.540
 - What?

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:09.380
 - But it doesn't really work.

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:10.220
 - That's exactly it.

00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:11.500
 - No, it's not, it's not actually practical.

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:13.660
 - But it's like, "Nah, I've definitely rubbed

00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:15.260
 my garlicky fingers up and down,

00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:17.220
 stainless steel stuff to no avail."

00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:19.780
 - And does real soap not work at all for garlic?

00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:22.420
 - No, I don't think anything works for it,

00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:23.580
 except using garlic in a jar,

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:26.140
 which I've resorted to now in order to sustain my marriage.

00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:29.340
 - I think just being happy with smells of garlic.

00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:31.860
 - All that, James, I wish life were that simple.

00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:32.940
 (all laughing)

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:34.940
 - What a weird cryptic sentence about your marriage

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:36.020
 that just slipped in there.

00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:37.340
 (all laughing)

00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:39.220
 - Anna's husband is a vampire.

00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:42.540
 (all laughing)

00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:44.940
 - Can I give you a QI question,

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:46.740
 but you've got to pretend you're in ancient Rome,

00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:47.580
 and then it works.

00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:49.740
 - Sure, do we have to do it in Latin?

00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:50.580
 - Yes, so that's okay.

00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:52.780
 I'm sure the listeners at home are fluent.

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:53.620
 So--

00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:54.460
 - Shall we?

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:55.540
 (all laughing)

00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:58.340
 - Oh, no, Alex actually can do this.

00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:00.460
 - It's a guy studying Latin.

00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:01.540
 - You only need to know one word,

00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:03.780
 and that's the Latin word for steel.

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:05.740
 And astonishingly, they had a version of steel

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:06.580
 as far back as then,

00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:09.460
 which was invented in India about 400 BC,

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:12.540
 but it wasn't able to be mass produced until the 19th century.

00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:14.580
 But they did have it, made it to ancient Rome.

00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:17.620
 The Latin word for steel is chalebe,

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:20.580
 and it was named after that chalebe's people

00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:22.140
 who lived on the Black Sea.

00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:24.580
 Okay, so you're in Latin QI.

00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:28.260
 What did the chalebe's people invent?

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:31.300
 - The chalebe people, they made metal.

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:33.380
 - I mean, the Latin for steel is chalebe.

00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:34.220
 I'm just gonna say that.

00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:35.060
 - Oh, okay, I see.

00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:37.820
 - Is it the word caliber?

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:40.660
 - X-caliber, swords.

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:41.980
 - Dan, can I get, I feel like you're the one

00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:43.580
 who gives the more obvious stupid answer.

00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:44.420
 Can you do that now?

00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:47.100
 - I'm still busy trying to picture myself.

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:50.060
 What character I am, what do I know, what do I not know?

00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:51.900
 - Chalebe, and what there's supposed to be

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:53.260
 an obvious answer to this.

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:54.940
 - They invented steel.

00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:56.140
 - Oh, they invented steel.

00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:57.100
 Did they invent steel?

00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:58.700
 - And then you get a klaxon.

00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:01.060
 - They invented steel.

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:01.900
 - I don't know what's going on.

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:04.860
 I think God, Anna didn't pitch QI to the BBC initially.

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:05.700
 - It's a script editor.

00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:07.300
 I don't understand how she's made such a mess of this.

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:08.980
 - I've rewritten all the scripts in Latin.

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:10.860
 This is so awkward.

00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:12.380
 I'm saying to a Latin audience,

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:14.540
 what did the chalebe's people invent?

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:16.020
 You know, speaking Latin,

00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:18.020
 that chalebe is Latin for steel.

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:19.340
 - Okay, so it's steel.

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:20.340
 - Steel, woo, woo, woo.

00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:22.340
 - Klaxon, okay, go ahead, okay, yeah, let me see.

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:23.180
 - And they didn't,

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:25.300
 they just invented another kind of hybrid iron.

00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:27.620
 They had this kind of iron, steel.

00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:30.700
 - Do you wanna hear about the barbed wire was?

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:31.540
 - Yes.

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:33.860
 - Okay, so barbed wire invented

00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:37.780
 in 1873 in America by Joseph Glidden

00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:40.540
 and used by farmers to protect their farms.

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:42.220
 Who was not happy about it?

00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:44.740
 - The blunt wire manufacturers.

00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:45.580
 (laughing)

00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:47.020
 - Yeah, fence makers.

00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:47.860
 - Yeah.

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:49.020
 - Oh, yeah, that's true.

00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:50.180
 - Ramblers.

00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:51.660
 - Ramblers, lots of ramblers in there.

00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:52.500
 - Golfers.

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:55.020
 - Golfers, yeah, these are all great answers.

00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:57.140
 But all wrong.

00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:59.220
 - I actually feel like ramblers,

00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:01.500
 'cause I think I may know the answer,

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:03.860
 but ramblers might be a vaguely correct-ish.

00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:05.340
 People who wanted to ramble, right?

00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:06.180
 - I think it's true.

00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:08.860
 I mean, not many people like barbed wire, I'd say, but.

00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:11.420
 - The answer is cowboys,

00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:15.940
 because if you had a farm and you didn't have fences,

00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:18.380
 your cows and sheep could run anywhere,

00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:21.460
 but you kept them in the right place by employing cowboys.

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:22.700
 But as soon as you had bad wire,

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:24.860
 you didn't need to employ cowboys anymore.

00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:27.180
 - This is the first 18. - Who ramble freely,

00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:29.420
 which is why I've given Alex half the points.

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:32.340
 - Rambles, they're on horses.

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:35.020
 - Yeah, I think of rambling as just sort of roaming free,

00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:36.780
 but do you think it has to be on foot?

00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:39.180
 - I think what we're doing now is rambling.

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:40.020
 - But the other thing,

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:42.940
 the other people didn't like it were small ranchers,

00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:44.220
 because if you had a big ranch

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:46.140
 and you could afford loads of barbed wire,

00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:49.180
 you could put loads of barbed wire around your farm.

00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:50.580
 But actually, in those days,

00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:52.540
 people weren't really sure where one farm stopped

00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:54.060
 and another farm started.

00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:55.460
 So if you were a small rancher,

00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:58.060
 you would often find that you would turn up to your ranch

00:37:58.060 --> 00:37:58.900
 and there's a load of barbed wire

00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:00.700
 and you couldn't get to your stuff anymore.

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:04.620
 And so there was a huge amount of violence and tension

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:07.460
 between these kind of small ranchers and the big ranchers.

00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:09.340
 And there were wire cutting groups

00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:11.260
 that would go out and cut all the wires.

00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:12.700
 And actually Grover Cleveland,

00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:14.380
 the president had to send in the army

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:17.300
 to remove any unlawful barbed wire fences.

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:20.300
 - They formed sort of gangs, didn't they?

00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:21.300
 With really fun names.

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:24.020
 They were called like the blue devils, the owls.

00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:26.740
 - They supported Iron Maiden, didn't they?

00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:28.060
 - Sorry, you're right.

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:31.700
 - Native Americans as well didn't like it

00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:34.300
 because it stopped buffaloes rambling.

00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:39.260
 I'm gonna make ramble happen.

00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:42.780
 And they depended so much on their livelihood for buffaloes.

00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:43.980
 It's one of the reasons that buffaloes

00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:45.820
 basically went extinct by the end of the century

00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:47.940
 is that they couldn't roam free anymore.

00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:49.620
 They were fenced in.

00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:51.340
 And it was all kind of Lincoln's fault, wasn't it?

00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:52.660
 'Cause he signed this act,

00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:56.020
 which said everyone can have a bunch of free land

00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:58.300
 in the Wild West if you agree to farm it.

00:38:58.300 --> 00:38:59.740
 So all these farmers moved there.

00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:02.620
 And then we're like, how do we stop these buffaloes

00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:04.700
 from trampling all over our crops?

00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:05.540
 - Bloody Lincoln.

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:06.820
 - Electric wire, right?

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:08.220
 After the barbed wire.

00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:09.060
 - Yeah.

00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:10.340
 - I'm just trying to think.

00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:12.580
 I wonder how many people died in that small town

00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:14.660
 who were having a nostalgic piss on a bit of wire.

00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:16.900
 (laughing)

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:20.060
 - I think that's a myth, isn't it?

00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:22.660
 If you piss on electric feds, you get electrocuted.

00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:24.020
 Don't try it at home.

00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:24.860
 Don't try it at home.

00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:25.940
 Who's got electric feds at home?

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:28.660
 (laughing)

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:29.980
 - Get out of my room, Mum.

00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:31.060
 I did warn you.

00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:32.140
 (laughing)

00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:34.180
 - I think the myth that I remember,

00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:36.140
 and again, I'm not sure that this is true,

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:39.940
 so people shouldn't try it at someone else's home.

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:43.300
 But your urine stream isn't usually a complete stream.

00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:44.900
 It's usually got gaps in it enough

00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:47.460
 that the electricity can't travel up it.

00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:49.140
 - Did anyone come across

00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:51.020
 this Guardian Notes and Queries section?

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:52.740
 So you know, the Guardian notes and queries

00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:54.660
 and someone asks a question and lots of,

00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:57.940
 often people who have inside knowledge answer underneath.

00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:00.860
 And there's one that's When Was Wire Invented.

00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:02.180
 Did any of you see this?

00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:03.020
 - No.

00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:03.940
 - It's just very confusing.

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:05.820
 So there's When Was Wire Invented

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:08.980
 and then various people underneath give their answers.

00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:11.660
 And one of the answers is,

00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:14.620
 fierce controversy surrounded the invention of wire.

00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:16.540
 And it goes on to explain that Thomas Malham

00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:18.740
 said he invented wire in 1830

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:20.340
 at his foundry in Sheffield.

00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:23.260
 But a Frenchman, Jean-François Martin,

00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:25.820
 also said he'd invented wire at the same time.

00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:27.100
 There was this legal action

00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:28.620
 contesting the right to the patent.

00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:30.780
 It was never resolved 'cause Thomas Malham died

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:32.500
 of an inflamed liver.

00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:34.500
 And then it said, it's extraordinary fact.

00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:37.700
 Thomas Malham's memorial is an Abney Park cemetery,

00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:38.540
 very near where I used to live,

00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:40.660
 which has lots of amazing gravestones on it.

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:42.340
 And it's now rusted away,

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:45.180
 but it used to be constructed entirely of wire

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:47.700
 in the shape of an anvil topped with a falcon.

00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:50.500
 And the source was a book called Wire,

00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:54.120
 It's History and Application by Dr. A. Stone.

00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:56.700
 (all laughing)

00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:59.980
 - It's a different material.

00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:02.620
 - Well, it is a different material.

00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:04.300
 But there's nothing obviously in this to give away

00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:05.580
 that it's completely made up.

00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:07.140
 It's completely made up. - Oh, it's completely made up.

00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:08.460
 Oh, okay, fine.

00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:10.580
 - This person gives this extraordinary story

00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:12.140
 of the history of the Foundry of Wire.

00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:13.900
 And I was like, brilliant, something fascinating.

00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:15.020
 God, there's Abney Park.

00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:16.780
 I can't believe I never saw that.

00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:17.900
 - It's completely false.

00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:19.980
 - So this is the story of you reading a comment section,

00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:21.100
 finding the information ought to be true.

00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:22.540
 - It's not a comment section.

00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:24.340
 It's Guardian Notes and Queries, okay?

00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:27.940
 You get highbrow experts replying to people about,

00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:29.780
 and then practices. - But the joke is can slip in.

00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:30.620
 That's the problem.

00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:32.580
 - Yeah, it's not a very good joke though, is it?

00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:33.980
 - I don't know, A. Stone.

00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:34.820
 - A. Stone?

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:37.140
 - Pretty good, I did laugh really hard at this.

00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:38.300
 - That's not a joke.

00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:39.540
 I know jokes, guys.

00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:42.580
 (all laughing)

00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:44.860
 - Just on other things you can use your info.

00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:46.500
 Virgin Boy eggs.

00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:47.340
 - Oh, yeah.

00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:48.180
 - Do you remember this?

00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:49.020
 - Virgin Boy eggs.

00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:52.700
 - So they are a traditional dish from China, from Dongyang.

00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:55.100
 And basically, it's exactly what it sounds like.

00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:57.860
 They boil eggs in the urine of young boys.

00:41:57.860 --> 00:41:59.260
 So like 10 or younger.

00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:01.940
 - That's not what Virgin Boy eggs sounds like.

00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:02.780
 That's gonna be 20.

00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:04.780
 - It's what it translates with boy egg, fine.

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:05.900
 Like, again, urine boy eggs.

00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:06.740
 You're absolutely right, yeah.

00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:07.580
 - Urine boy eggs, got it.

00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:08.420
 - You're trying to, sorry.

00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:10.140
 They are, it translates as Virgin Boy eggs,

00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:12.460
 Virgin Boy being like small boy eggs.

00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:15.500
 And yeah, they, all through the town,

00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:16.780
 the kids are encouraged to,

00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:17.740
 when they go to the loon schools,

00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:19.060
 they either can go to the normal toilet

00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:21.420
 or they can go and pee in like a collection bucket

00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:22.740
 in the corridor.

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:27.180
 And then all of this urine gets taken

00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:28.940
 and then eggs are boiled in them.

00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:31.060
 And it's a whole process where like they're double boiled

00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:32.620
 in this urine and people eat them

00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:33.780
 and it's like a delicacy.

00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:36.740
 - Yeah, urine's been used like that for a lot, hasn't it?

00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:37.580
 - Yeah, it's interesting.

00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:39.260
 There is definitely like a legit ick factor there

00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:40.700
 where I'm like, it's somebody else's urine

00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:42.180
 that this has been cooked in.

00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:43.020
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:43.860
 - It's very interesting.

00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:45.500
 - They had 100 years eggs.

00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:46.340
 - 100 years eggs?

00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:48.900
 - Yeah, they're like supposed to be 100 years old.

00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:50.100
 They're not really 100 years old,

00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:51.020
 but they are quite old.

00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:51.860
 - Very old, yeah.

00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:54.780
 - Yeah, and they just taste really sulfurous.

00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:56.340
 - But they haven't been bathed in urine, have they?

00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:57.180
 - No, they're just standard.

00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:58.540
 - They're just a different kind of weird egg, yeah.

00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:00.060
 - It's the urine thing I don't like, yeah.

00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:02.060
 - I can talk about weird eggs that I've eaten.

00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:03.700
 I had that at Balut, you know,

00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:07.180
 that has the baby chickens, the embryo of the chickens.

00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:08.020
 - Oh yeah.

00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:09.740
 All right, so save it for your spin-off weird eggs

00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:13.020
 I've eaten podcast, which will run forever and ever.

00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:14.700
 It's, they've actually poached me.

00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:15.540
 Poached me.

00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:16.380
 - Hey.

00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:17.220
 (laughing)

00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:18.740
 - The rest is weird eggs.

00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:20.980
 This is you, go find your podcast.

00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:22.860
 (laughing)

00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:25.980
 It's me and Delia Smith just talking about weird eggs.

00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:27.320
 - Weird eggs.

00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:29.900
 (upbeat music)

00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:35.340
 - Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,

00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:36.940
 and that is Alex.

00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:39.260
 - My fact this week is that dragonfly wings

00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:40.980
 are equipped with tiny knives

00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:43.820
 that physically rip bacteria apart.

00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:44.660
 - What?

00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:45.500
 - Nice.

00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:46.340
 - It's amazing.

00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:47.180
 - Oh my God.

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:48.000
 - It's just, it's the property they have

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:48.840
 that keeps their wings clean.

00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:49.680
 - So clever.

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:50.520
 - Can I ask a question?

00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:51.360
 - Yeah.

00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:53.020
 - Alex, straight off the bat.

00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:54.820
 I've currently got a chest infection,

00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:56.620
 and I'm on antibiotics.

00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:59.820
 Could I instead chuck some dragonfly wings?

00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:01.440
 - That's such a great question.

00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:05.140
 - I don't want to answer that in case you die.

00:44:05.140 --> 00:44:06.700
 (laughing)

00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:07.540
 - I thought you were gonna say,

00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:09.740
 should I strap a series of knives to my arms

00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:11.040
 and flap them around?

00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:11.880
 - Yeah.

00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:12.860
 - All sort of option.

00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:13.700
 - I think probably not.

00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:14.820
 I think dragonflies are amazing

00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:16.380
 if humans use them as inspiration

00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:18.340
 for scientific innovations so much,

00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:20.700
 but one of the things that we are doing

00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:22.500
 is trying to emulate this,

00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:23.820
 what's called, they're called nanopillars,

00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:26.240
 these tiny, tiny sort of blunt pillars

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:27.360
 that are so, so small.

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:30.740
 They're 100,000th of the width of a human hair.

00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:31.860
 I mean, so, so tiny.

00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:33.580
 So bacteria literally lands on them,

00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:35.200
 gets caught between two and gets ripped apart.

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:37.220
 I mean, it's absolutely astonishing how small it is.

00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:38.960
 - There's more than 10 billion of them

00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:41.060
 per wing, basically, on each one.

00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:41.980
 - Absolutely mad.

00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:42.820
 - Yeah.

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:44.700
 And they're really, really good at destroying

00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:46.140
 almost all bacteria that lands on them.

00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:48.260
 So, there's a university in Melbourne, Australia

00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:51.300
 who have successfully made a sort of plastic version.

00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:54.020
 So, that could be the new stainless steel.

00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:55.860
 You know, next time you go into your public bathroom,

00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:57.460
 there'll be a plastic handle.

00:44:57.460 --> 00:45:00.860
 - So scientists have managed to make stuff that small?

00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:01.700
 - Yeah.

00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:02.540
 - Yeah.

00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:03.380
 - Well done.

00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:04.220
 - Well done.

00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:05.060
 - I don't know.

00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:05.900
 - Well, you can see when they sort of,

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:06.740
 you can do novels on rice now.

00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:09.720
 - You know that that's quite different to having something

00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:11.740
 that there's 10 billion of them on a wing.

00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:14.160
 - I don't think they've been manually sharpening each one

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:16.720
 with a tiny, tiny set of carving knives or anything.

00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:18.320
 - I once pushed an electron

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:20.280
 with a scanning tunneling microscope.

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:21.120
 - Wow.

00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:21.960
 - Right.

00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:24.280
 And it took me about an hour and a half.

00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:26.120
 (laughing)

00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:27.480
 - It was quite a long time ago.

00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:29.400
 No, just like to slightly other place

00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:30.480
 to where it already was.

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:31.720
 Like, I just moved it.

00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:32.680
 - Can you just blown it?

00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:33.720
 - No, 'cause it's an electron.

00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:34.840
 It's so small.

00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:37.660
 So you have this little sort of, it's like a needle,

00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:39.740
 but it says some kind of quantum effect.

00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:40.580
 I don't know.

00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:42.140
 I did study it, but I don't really understand it.

00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:44.700
 But I had the machine and then it was like a computer game

00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:47.180
 thing and you would kind of push this one electron.

00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:48.020
 And the idea was I need to.

00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:49.060
 - Oh, they meant you to.

00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:49.900
 - Yeah.

00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:50.740
 - It wasn't like OCD.

00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:51.740
 You didn't just, it's like walking in

00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:53.180
 and seeing a painting slightly askew.

00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:55.420
 You're like, oh, I'm really uncomfortable with that.

00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:57.580
 - I really like Princess and the P.E. too.

00:45:57.580 --> 00:45:58.780
 This place is such a mess.

00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:01.020
 (laughing)

00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:05.800
 - But yeah, dragonflies are actually astonishing.

00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:06.640
 - They're incredible.

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:07.480
 - They are amazing.

00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:08.840
 Every fact I learn about them is that you're

00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:10.200
 the most metal insane.

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:12.840
 They are the most efficient killers in nature.

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:15.000
 They are the most efficient predators.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.520
 They kill over 95% of the prey that they chase,

00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:20.360
 which is like, that's unbelievable.

00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:22.560
 We're so lucky they're so small and they don't eat us.

00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:23.400
 - Yeah.

00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:24.240
 I love you called them the most metal.

00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:25.120
 They've opened for Iron Maiden.

00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:27.280
 (laughing)

00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:30.600
 - When they're lava, so like little worm things,

00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:32.560
 they kind of live underwater.

00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:34.820
 And then they shed the larval skin

00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:36.980
 and start to become a dragonfly.

00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:39.700
 And they create these wings,

00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:41.500
 but the wings are like made of jelly.

00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:43.960
 They're not like the wings that they have when they're older.

00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:45.660
 So they need to dry them out.

00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:50.200
 And so they produce sodium bicarbonate in the rectum

00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:53.060
 and they fart it out and it reacts with the water

00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:56.260
 and it creates CO2 and it dries out their wings,

00:46:56.260 --> 00:46:58.660
 which means that they become proper wings.

00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:00.420
 - They are their own hairdryer.

00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:02.140
 - Their ass is a hairdryer.

00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:03.080
 - But also when they're lava,

00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:05.680
 they eat through their anus as well.

00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:07.880
 And they also spend most of their lives as lava.

00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:10.000
 So they can, some species live up to five years,

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.480
 but they spend nearly all of it as a lava.

00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:12.320
 And then they become a dragonfly

00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:14.000
 for just a couple of months and flying around.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000
 - I always think it's weird with, it's not weird at all,

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.960
 but it's unfair to these animals

00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:19.400
 that we think of them as dragonflies.

00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:21.000
 When actually for almost all their life,

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.400
 they're not dragonflies at all.

00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:24.120
 - I think they want to be thought of as dragonflies

00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:26.280
 rather than these weird underwater insects.

00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:28.240
 A bit creepy, yeah, yeah.

00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:30.080
 It must be, I watched a great,

00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:31.840
 I watched a couple of great documentaries actually about them.

00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:34.400
 One of them was talking about the extraordinary moment

00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:37.340
 when they're climbing up a blade of sort of grass,

00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:38.760
 which they would do when they're emerging

00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:40.740
 from nymph phase into dragonfly phase,

00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:42.500
 climb a blade of grass out of the water.

00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:45.320
 And that first time that you feel the weight of gravity

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:47.520
 on you, they've been floating in water all of their lives.

00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:50.320
 And suddenly they slow down massively

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:53.120
 'cause it's suddenly having to wrench their body weight up.

00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:55.040
 And then if you watch videos of them emerging

00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:57.620
 from the Exoskeleton, it's very cool.

00:47:57.620 --> 00:48:01.880
 So their abdomen as a dragonfly is concertinid,

00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:05.540
 just like a telescope inside of their larval cell.

00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:06.860
 So when they burst out,

00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:08.740
 suddenly it's like pulling a telescope out

00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:10.600
 to its full extension.

00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:13.660
 And when they climb up, they can retreat at any point.

00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:16.780
 So they're not dragonfly yet until their massive googly eyes,

00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:17.820
 you know, they've got this big eyes,

00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:20.940
 until their eyes turn cloudy and white.

00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:22.980
 And then once the eyes have gone milky,

00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:23.860
 there's no going back.

00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:25.060
 - Oh my God, that's incredible.

00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:25.900
 - That's awesome.

00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:26.740
 - That's how you can tell.

00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:28.460
 - Wow, did you know they can't walk?

00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:31.020
 They've got six legs and they can climb with them,

00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:32.060
 but they can't walk on them.

00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:35.100
 But they mostly use them to like grab their prey in mid air

00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:37.100
 and like stab it and like.

00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:39.300
 - They're not called dragonwalks, Alex.

00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:41.620
 (laughing)

00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:43.420
 - I feel it's weird having to like as in most,

00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:46.820
 most flies and insects land or can also walk on there.

00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:48.860
 Let them use it to like stand and walk.

00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:50.660
 Whereas dragonflies specifically use it to grab

00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:52.580
 and hunt them more like pincers, that's great.

00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:54.980
 - They're so awesome that the U.S. decided to create

00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:59.300
 a spying dragonfly drone, which was based on

00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:01.380
 all these amazing things that dragonflies could do.

00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:04.420
 So it had tiny beads that could reflect light

00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:06.020
 and could check for oscillations.

00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:07.740
 So you could work out what someone was saying

00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:09.100
 from a massive distance away.

00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:12.220
 It could flap its wings 1800 times per minute

00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:16.460
 using the lithium nitrate crystals controlled by lasers.

00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:19.540
 It costs about $2 million for each ones,

00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:21.980
 but they only ever tested it in lab conditions.

00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:23.180
 And then when they took it out,

00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:24.980
 they realized it couldn't cope with wind.

00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:27.100
 (laughing)

00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:29.900
 - I found a documentary by David Attenborough,

00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:31.980
 which was called "Dragons and Damsels".

00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:33.940
 He made it in 2019, it was a TV special.

00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:35.940
 And I really wanted to watch it.

00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:37.780
 And so I was Googling "Dragons and Damsels"

00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:39.700
 to see where you could get it.

00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:42.140
 Sadly, the closest I could get was a documentary

00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:46.140
 of similar length, about 45 minutes called "Dragons and Damsels",

00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:49.340
 released on YouTube by Buxton Civic Associations

00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:51.940
 during the pandemic and hosted by a chap called

00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:56.420
 Richard Nisley Marple, which was really good as well.

00:49:56.420 --> 00:49:58.260
 And so I'm gonna tell you some things I've learned

00:49:58.260 --> 00:49:59.980
 from "Dragons and Damsels".

00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:02.660
 The production quality's slightly lower.

00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:04.060
 There were interruptions like,

00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:06.460
 "Can you see my cursor as I'm moving it out there?"

00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:08.660
 (laughing)

00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:10.460
 And sort of, "Can everyone see me on the screen?"

00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:12.540
 or "Can you see the thing I'm showing you?"

00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:13.380
 But...

00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:14.220
 (laughing)

00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:15.300
 - I'm never gonna, Attenborough doing that

00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:16.620
 or flying him out to the art, because they're like,

00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:17.780
 "Why can't I see them?"

00:50:17.780 --> 00:50:19.860
 (laughing)

00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:21.100
 - But I would love to see Attenborough

00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:23.660
 doing a new narration over this documentary.

00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:26.180
 "Here we see the human attempt, the cursor."

00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:28.860
 - Yes, the thumbnails have confused

00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:30.980
 the good Jesus out of him.

00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:31.820
 - Was it good though?

00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:32.660
 - It was really good.

00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:34.660
 So he said, "Sweetly," he said,

00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:37.220
 "The Southern Hawker dragonfly.

00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:39.260
 "They're the only dragonflies that will fly up to you

00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:41.020
 "and look you straight in the eye."

00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:41.860
 - That's scary.

00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:44.060
 - He said, "It's quite frightening."

00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:46.420
 - Sounds like a U.S. drug, doesn't it really?

00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:47.860
 - Maybe that's what they are.

00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:49.300
 They always have been.

00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:50.500
 He said, "The way to tell the difference

00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:52.220
 "between damselflies and dragonflies,"

00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:53.140
 where there are many ways,

00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:55.220
 but one of them is, and you have to look quite closely,

00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:58.220
 but during mating, they both grab the female from behind,

00:50:58.220 --> 00:51:02.780
 but dragonflies grab the female on the back of the head,

00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:05.860
 whereas damsels grab the female on the back of the neck.

00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:07.620
 So you do have to be quite close.

00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:10.340
 (laughing)

00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:12.300
 And also I really enjoyed a metaphor he used,

00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:14.540
 which actually referenced a fact that we mentioned before,

00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:17.020
 which is that ancient dragonflies millions of years ago

00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:19.140
 were up to a meter wide.

00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:21.100
 And as he said, you can imagine what sort of a mess

00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:22.860
 that would make if it hit your windscreen.

00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:24.500
 (laughing)

00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:26.540
 I actually laughed out loud at that.

00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:28.300
 And I've never laughed out loud at David Attenborough.

00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:30.340
 - Or any of our jokes on this podcast yet.

00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:31.620
 - She knows jokes.

00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:32.460
 - She does.

00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:33.780
 - Anyone knows jokes.

00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:35.460
 - But the female dragonflies also,

00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:37.780
 they fake their deaths to avoid having sex sometimes.

00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:38.620
 - Yes.

00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:39.940
 - Oh, they do do that, don't they?

00:51:39.940 --> 00:51:41.140
 - And the other thing I know about dragonflies' sex

00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:43.580
 is that the males have spoon-shaped penises

00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:46.060
 so that they can scoop out sperm of the previous guy

00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:47.100
 if he finds any inside.

00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:49.260
 - Ah, that is clever.

00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:51.060
 Bit gross, but yeah.

00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:52.700
 Well, no, but necessary, right?

00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:53.860
 - Well, yeah, I suppose so.

00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:55.500
 - Arguably humans have that as well.

00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:56.340
 - Really, yeah.

00:51:56.340 --> 00:51:57.180
 - What?

00:51:57.180 --> 00:51:59.860
 The idea is that the bell-end shape at the top of a penis

00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:03.900
 could possibly be used to scrape out other people's semen.

00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:07.220
 - Yeah, or just get a half-cut tennis ball

00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:10.820
 and you can plunge that out.

00:52:10.820 --> 00:52:14.300
 - I'm actually starting to question your fact now, Alex,

00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:16.180
 having just looked at my notes,

00:52:16.180 --> 00:52:19.780
 'cause Anna previously gave us a fake fact from A Stone.

00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:22.300
 And your fact about an insect

00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:24.380
 comes from someone called a wolf.

00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:25.220
 - Really?

00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:26.540
 - Yeah.

00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:29.780
 It's Dr. Annalena Wolf.

00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:31.660
 She does make this, there's this amazing point

00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:32.980
 that's made inside this article,

00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:34.180
 which you touched on earlier,

00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:36.980
 which is basically all the things that we're looking for

00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:39.260
 for modern invention,

00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:42.060
 evolution has worked out somewhere on our planet.

00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:43.380
 We just need to look around

00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:46.260
 for a four billion years worth of evolution

00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:47.940
 and you eventually find something

00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:51.100
 that can be then taken into the lab to try and mimic,

00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:52.580
 which is pretty awesome.

00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:54.260
 - It's the mimicking that's hard, I think, sometimes.

00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:57.020
 We actually don't have four billion years to make it.

00:52:57.020 --> 00:52:59.180
 We've got about a week before the funding dries up.

00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:00.020
 - Yeah.

00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:00.860
 (laughing)

00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:03.460
 But they've been around 300 million years.

00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:05.500
 Dinosaurs were walking the planet.

00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:07.100
 I mean, that's always, 'cause in my head,

00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:08.860
 the romanticism of the dinosaurs

00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:10.620
 being just because of how old they were in alive,

00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:11.900
 and we forget all these animals.

00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:12.860
 Dragonflies were there.

00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:13.980
 - Sure, a different version.

00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:16.700
 - In fairness to people who make cartoons

00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:18.060
 and dinosaur movies,

00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:20.260
 they do often have dragonflies flying around.

00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:21.100
 - They do, they do, that's true.

00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:21.940
 - They do, that's true.

00:53:21.940 --> 00:53:23.060
 - Dragonflies, yeah, that's so true.

00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:23.900
 - That is true.

00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:24.740
 - Yeah.

00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:25.860
 - One other incredible thing about them

00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:28.820
 you wouldn't expect is how far they can fly,

00:53:28.820 --> 00:53:31.100
 and that's another thing that scientists are looking into.

00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:32.500
 Can we replicate it?

00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:34.220
 'Cause the globe skimmer dragonfly

00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:37.060
 has the record for the longest insect migration,

00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:40.900
 and it does a round trip of 18,000 kilometers.

00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:41.740
 - That is insane.

00:53:41.740 --> 00:53:43.820
 It's always one of these things where I think,

00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:46.460
 does it count if it's multi-generational?

00:53:46.460 --> 00:53:48.700
 - Yeah, absolutely not, yeah.

00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:50.860
 - 'Cause it is one of these things where the dragonfly,

00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:52.860
 this particular dragonfly lays its eggs

00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:54.540
 and lives and mates in shallow pools,

00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:56.580
 'cause the pools are warmer if they're shallow,

00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:57.980
 and so it can grow faster.

00:53:57.980 --> 00:54:00.500
 So it follows the rain, so it can follow shallow pools,

00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:03.060
 so it flies from India to Africa,

00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:06.260
 and then the next generation flies back.

00:54:06.260 --> 00:54:07.860
 - If I went on a gap here and then like,

00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:09.700
 I came back and it was my son,

00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:12.420
 like you wouldn't be like, "How is Africa?"

00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:14.540
 Like, "What was your dad?"

00:54:14.540 --> 00:54:16.660
 - Alex is so well-traveled.

00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:18.540
 Alex and Alex Jr. together.

00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:21.120
 (upbeat music)

00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:25.780
 - Okay, that is it.

00:54:25.780 --> 00:54:26.860
 That is all of our facts.

00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:28.220
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:54:28.220 --> 00:54:30.500

 And my Instagram is @NoSuchThingAsJamesHarkin.

00:54:41.420 --> 00:54:43.940
 - Alex, I don't have any socials at the moment.

00:54:43.940 --> 00:54:44.780
 - Yeah?

00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:46.460
 - Ooh, look at me.

00:54:46.460 --> 00:54:47.540
 - Copycat.

00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:48.380
 - Live my life.

00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:50.900
 - And Anna, how can they get in touch with all of us?

00:54:50.900 --> 00:54:52.540
 - And you can get in touch with all of us

00:54:52.540 --> 00:54:54.540
