00:00:00,00:00:04,"Hi everybody, just before we start the show, we want to say a big hi to"
00:00:04,00:00:09,"new listeners coming to us from BBC Sounds, where the podcast now exists."
00:00:09,00:00:17,Welcome to the fold. We are no such thing as a fish. I'm Anna. I'm here with Dan. Hi Dan. Hello.
00:00:17,00:00:20,"What do we do? Yeah, yeah, so there's four of us. We are QI Elbs."
00:00:20,00:00:27,"We are the people who are involved in the TV series QI. And if you enjoy that, if you enjoy all the weird facts,"
00:00:27,00:00:34,"this is a real kind of concentrated distilled version of it where we just sit around and share the best, most wonderful,"
00:00:34,00:00:37,most odd things that we've discovered over the last seven days.
00:00:37,00:00:42,"Yes, and also if you enjoy the occasional incredibly immature sense of humour on QI,"
00:00:42,00:00:49,then you'll get that by the bucket load here. And with a little bit of a warning that there's the occasional bit of adult content.
00:00:49,00:00:55,"So there is swearing, there's the odd adult theme, a little bit of animal sex sometimes makes it in, sometimes a little bit of human"
00:00:55,00:01:02,"sex facts make it in, but it's all for the purpose of learning weird, interesting, amazing facts."
00:01:02,00:01:08,And you'll notice we've got 10 episodes up there right now on BBC Sounds and from now on every episode will be published there.
00:01:08,00:01:15,"That's right. Now we also just want to quickly address the members, the existing listeners of our show and particularly the members of Club Fish."
00:01:15,00:01:20,We know that many of you might have joined Club Fish because you get an ad free version of our show.
00:01:20,00:01:24,"Well, if you head over to BBC Sounds, you are going to get the ad free version of the show."
00:01:24,00:01:26,But I wouldn't leave Club Fish. You know what's there?
00:01:26,00:01:31,"The amazing discord, the behind the scenes bonus content like the compilations and drop us a line."
00:01:31,00:01:34,You want to miss out on Andy saying bye at random moments?
00:01:34,00:01:36,"No, you don't. Absolutely not."
00:01:36,00:01:41,"So if you do want to go in just for the ad free stuff, absolutely head over to BBC Sounds."
00:01:41,00:01:45,"Otherwise, stay with us in Club Fish and enjoy all the background content."
00:01:45,00:01:49,"So huge, huge welcome to the BBC Sounds listeners."
00:01:49,00:01:51,Thanks for joining us.
00:01:51,00:01:55,And this is a weekly show and we're going to keep going for the next 400 years.
00:01:55,00:01:59,So enjoy and on with the show on with the show.
00:02:15,00:02:23,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn."
00:02:23,00:02:24,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:02:24,00:02:28,"I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Anna Tyshinski and Alex Bell."
00:02:28,00:02:33,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days."
00:02:33,00:02:36,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:02:36,00:02:38,"Starting with fact number one, that is James."
00:02:38,00:02:46,"OK, my fact this week is the artist Goya, who was famously a deaf man, lived in a house called the House of the Deaf Man."
00:02:46,00:02:50,It was actually named after a different deaf man who lived in that house.
00:02:50,00:02:56,"So first of all, what is Goya's full name?"
00:02:56,00:02:57,Because I think you were practicing.
00:02:57,00:02:59,"Oh, I thought you were calling back something that had happened before."
00:02:59,00:03:06,"I was. Yeah, and his full name was Francisco Jose de Goya and Lucien Teff."
00:03:07,00:03:11,Lovely. Nice. That is a lot less Spanish than I went in the pre-show channel.
00:03:11,00:03:14,And he is a very famous artist.
00:03:14,00:03:22,He was around in the early 19th century and he's kind of the link between the old masters like Rembrandt and whoever
00:03:22,00:03:26,and the modern artists because he was doing lots of satires and lots of incredible stuff.
00:03:26,00:03:28,He is an absolutely incredible artist.
00:03:28,00:03:29,He's probably my favorite artist.
00:03:29,00:03:33,"Yeah, I think so. I can actually see why I can connect those two things."
00:03:34,00:03:40,"Oh, yeah. Yeah, we'll get into it. Some of his dark, disturbed, latter paintings."
00:03:40,00:03:42,But can you please tell us about this?
00:03:42,00:03:46,"OK, I want to know, did this deaf man name the house after himself, the deaf man?"
00:03:46,00:03:50,"No, it was named by locals as that because this deaf man had lived there"
00:03:50,00:03:52,and then later Goya moved in there.
00:03:52,00:03:56,And did he move in there because he was only looking for houses called House for a Deaf Man?
00:03:56,00:04:00,"Yeah, he actually googled House for a Deaf Man and this is what came up."
00:04:00,00:04:03,But there was nothing special about the house that made it like accessible for deaf people.
00:04:03,00:04:07,"No, it was a really nice house and he was a former court artist."
00:04:07,00:04:12,So he had money and had a pension from the monarchy and stuff like that.
00:04:12,00:04:14,It was also sort of a way from the politics.
00:04:14,00:04:18,He sort of wanted a place to retreat and sort of get away because he was heavily involved.
00:04:18,00:04:22,His art would often either do satire or make political statements.
00:04:22,00:04:26,"Yeah, exactly. He thought if he hangs around where the Spanish Inquisition are,"
00:04:26,00:04:30,"then there's a decent chance he might get, you know, so he wanted to get away."
00:04:31,00:04:36,"But one interesting thing about this building is his most famous work for people at home,"
00:04:36,00:04:40,"perhaps, is called Saturn Devouring His Son."
00:04:40,00:04:41,You might know it.
00:04:41,00:04:45,It's like a real devilish face and he seems to be biting the head off.
00:04:45,00:04:49,What could be a chicken or could be his son or something like that?
00:04:49,00:04:51,It's a really sort of dark painting.
00:04:51,00:04:52,It's harrowing. It's like really quite scary.
00:04:52,00:04:55,"Yeah, if you Google it, you'll probably recognize it from memes and stuff."
00:04:55,00:04:57,But that was.
00:05:00,00:05:05,But it was on his wall in this house and actually he painted a load of these
00:05:05,00:05:07,kind of satirical paintings on the wall of his house.
00:05:07,00:05:12,And actually they ended up being chipped off because he didn't intend to sell them
00:05:12,00:05:14,or anything. They were just murals in his house.
00:05:14,00:05:16,They're known as the black paintings now. Precisely.
00:05:16,00:05:20,"He have a whole his whole first period of his life was much more involved in politics,"
00:05:20,00:05:22,"like you say, painting on commission for royal courts."
00:05:22,00:05:25,And there was an awful lot more like of a positive vibe to his painting.
00:05:25,00:05:29,And then he got really sick and he went deaf as a result of one of his illnesses.
00:05:29,00:05:33,And then he became very like depressed and obsessed with illness
00:05:33,00:05:36,and obsessed with like death and kind of neurotic.
00:05:36,00:05:39,"And these paintings, we think, reflect this dark state that he was in."
00:05:39,00:05:42,"Yeah, they're all really weird and mysterious as well."
00:05:42,00:05:44,We don't actually know that the painting is called Saturn devouring itself.
00:05:44,00:05:46,We don't know anything about. We don't think about them.
00:05:46,00:05:48,"Yeah, because like you say, they were all painted on the walls."
00:05:48,00:05:51,And then the wallpaper had to kind of be chipped away from the wall
00:05:51,00:05:52,and then put onto canvas.
00:05:52,00:05:55,But like a lot of art historians think that like they had to be very
00:05:55,00:05:57,significantly altered when that happened.
00:05:57,00:05:58,"Yeah, definitely restoration."
00:05:58,00:06:02,"Yeah, you can spot little bits of it that really they think again,"
00:06:02,00:06:05,it's almost theory. Is that damage or is that what he intended?
00:06:05,00:06:07,There's one called the dog.
00:06:07,00:06:10,It's basically a landscape where you see a dog's head sticking up
00:06:10,00:06:12,at the bottom of the painting.
00:06:12,00:06:15,"And, you know, is he coming over a sort of horizon?"
00:06:15,00:06:18,Is he coming over a bump in a hill? Is he drowning in quicksand?
00:06:18,00:06:19,A lot of people say he's drowning.
00:06:19,00:06:21,"I looked at him and thought, oh, it's like it's like kind of begging."
00:06:21,00:06:22,"Like you get a dog at a table begging,"
00:06:22,00:06:24,but a lot of people have attempted drowning.
00:06:24,00:06:27,"Yeah, but we have no idea, right? He's never intended anyone to see these."
00:06:27,00:06:31,These were private kind of things that he did on his wall at home.
00:06:31,00:06:33,"You know, if a kid drills in the wall, they get in trouble, don't they?"
00:06:33,00:06:36,"And yeah, kind of example is that setting."
00:06:36,00:06:38,"You've got to own your own house in order to then make those decisions, right?"
00:06:38,00:06:42,That's got to imagine if he was renting how pissed off they were.
00:06:42,00:06:44,You'll not get your deposit back.
00:06:44,00:06:46,"Yeah, so he gave it he gave the house to his grandson"
00:06:46,00:06:50,"and then his grandson sold it to, I don't know, a baron."
00:06:50,00:06:53,"And and then that's the guy who went, let's let's take this off,"
00:06:53,00:06:55,"put this on canvas, donate it to the museums."
00:06:55,00:06:58,"The dog in particular in the museum where it is,"
00:06:58,00:07:01,the curator of that museum says that there's not a single contemporary painter
00:07:01,00:07:04,in the world who does not pray in front of the dog.
00:07:04,00:07:06,"It's that important. Oh, yeah."
00:07:06,00:07:08,"I've got to say, the dog doesn't impress me as the guy."
00:07:08,00:07:10,I like I think some of the others are better.
00:07:10,00:07:13,Really is a big dog doesn't put anything out.
00:07:13,00:07:15,"It's like, it's a massive portrait shaped vertical painting."
00:07:15,00:07:18,The dog's right in the bottom and most of it's just brown.
00:07:18,00:07:20,Like 95 percent of it is just brown.
00:07:20,00:07:23,"Once you learn about Maljevic, by the way, who's painting is just black."
00:07:23,00:07:25,It's like literally just a black square.
00:07:25,00:07:28,"Right. Yeah, if you don't like something that's 90 percent brown,"
00:07:28,00:07:29,you're not going to like that.
00:07:29,00:07:31,I think the only reason people like the dogs
00:07:31,00:07:34,"is because you've filed through these like witches and decapitated,"
00:07:34,00:07:37,bloodied people tear each other to shreds and then you've got a little black dog.
00:07:37,00:07:38,People love animals.
00:07:38,00:07:39,"Yeah, people love animals."
00:07:39,00:07:41,He knew the tick tock generation was coming up.
00:07:41,00:07:43,He knew memes were on the way.
00:07:43,00:07:45,"He's so clever. It's actually doge, isn't it?"
00:07:45,00:07:49,So there's so much written about his art
00:07:49,00:07:51,"and the interpretations of it, but what do we know about Goya the man?"
00:07:51,00:07:54,Here's a few things that we know.
00:07:54,00:07:56,Are you presenting a documentary?
00:07:56,00:07:58,I thought you were on the South Bank show for a second.
00:07:58,00:08:00,It really felt like I was Melvin Bragg all of a sudden.
00:08:00,00:08:03,The smell of orange. Love the smell of orange.
00:08:03,00:08:04,"Oh, yeah. Yeah."
00:08:04,00:08:08,The smell of a girl's armpit loved it as long as it had an orange.
00:08:08,00:08:11,"You get this like a dating profile, right?"
00:08:11,00:08:15,"Well, this is the whiff of tobacco, the aftertaste of wine"
00:08:15,00:08:18,and the twanging rhythms of a street dance.
00:08:18,00:08:21,This is all according to a biography that was written about him.
00:08:21,00:08:23,Is it according to him himself?
00:08:23,00:08:26,"Because it feels like, OK, he wrote this down somewhere."
00:08:26,00:08:28,"It wasn't someone going, he seems like the kind of guy"
00:08:28,00:08:30,who loves sniffing girls armpits.
00:08:30,00:08:32,"Let's put that in. Yeah, I love the smell of an orange."
00:08:32,00:08:35,"Like, who doesn't like orange is generally pleasant."
00:08:35,00:08:36,Why would you like note that down?
00:08:36,00:08:38,"Well, maybe he chucked the orange thing in there"
00:08:38,00:08:41,to make up for the weirdness of the girls armpits so that there was.
00:08:41,00:08:43,"Yeah, I'm not totally crazy."
00:08:43,00:08:45,"I like normal things, too."
00:08:45,00:08:49,He was the first major artist to paint a woman entirely nude
00:08:49,00:08:52,"in a profane style, as in the this was the one"
00:08:52,00:08:53,that he got summoned by the inquisition.
00:08:53,00:08:56,"Yeah, so profane means not religious."
00:08:56,00:09:00,And this was the naked maca.
00:09:00,00:09:02,"Yes, it was deemed, I think, indecent"
00:09:02,00:09:04,and prejudicial to the common good.
00:09:04,00:09:06,"So, yeah, and I didn't know what a maca was,"
00:09:06,00:09:09,but machos and machas were according to the New Yorker.
00:09:09,00:09:13,"This is how New Yorker described them flamboyantly cheeky, lower class dandies."
00:09:14,00:09:16,And that's what I've got on my dating profile.
00:09:16,00:09:21,"Lower class, please, the other way you talk, Alex."
00:09:21,00:09:25,"But yeah, I got summoned by the inquisition"
00:09:25,00:09:28,and I just find his tangles with the inquisition quite bizarre.
00:09:28,00:09:29,"Yeah, so weird."
00:09:29,00:09:31,"Well, who knew the inquisition was still bloody"
00:09:31,00:09:32,happening the start of the 19th century?
00:09:32,00:09:34,"Are they lasted for ages, didn't they?"
00:09:34,00:09:35,It lasted ridiculously long.
00:09:35,00:09:37,It's practically going since late medieval times.
00:09:37,00:09:39,And still they're struggling on clinging on.
00:09:39,00:09:41,I think they were quite toothless by then.
00:09:41,00:09:43,Python sketch was topical.
00:09:43,00:09:45,"Yeah, but he did."
00:09:45,00:09:47,He got away with it with the naked painting.
00:09:47,00:09:50,"I believe by saying, well, if you think this was gross,"
00:09:50,00:09:53,then you're condemning your former king because he said
00:09:53,00:09:55,he was emulating a Velasquez painting
00:09:55,00:09:57,and that Philip the Fourth of Spain had loved.
00:09:57,00:10:02,"So he was going, well, your king loved this, basically, your dead king."
00:10:02,00:10:03,So what are you going to do?
00:10:03,00:10:05,"Well, the interesting thing I think about the naked"
00:10:05,00:10:09,"maha is that he gave it or sold it, I should say, to Godoy,"
00:10:09,00:10:11,who was the prime minister of Spain at the time.
00:10:11,00:10:16,"And the story goes that we know that Goya made two versions,"
00:10:16,00:10:19,"the naked maha and the not-naked maha, the clothed maha,"
00:10:19,00:10:21,you might call it.
00:10:21,00:10:26,And the prime minister supposedly kept the clothed one on display.
00:10:26,00:10:29,"And whenever his friends would come round after a few whiskeys,"
00:10:29,00:10:33,"he would say, look at this, and he would pull like a secret lever"
00:10:33,00:10:36,and the wall would spin round and the naked one would come out.
00:10:36,00:10:39,That's like one of those pens where you turn it upside down.
00:10:39,00:10:41,It's actually so tacky.
00:10:41,00:10:44,"Well, that's the story, and that's supposedly what happened."
00:10:44,00:10:47,"But for sure, the reason that he got brought in front of the Inquisition,"
00:10:47,00:10:51,"Goya is because Godoy was actually really controversial,"
00:10:51,00:10:52,because he was the prime minister.
00:10:52,00:10:55,"And this was one of the really controversial things that he did,"
00:10:55,00:10:57,having this terrible painting.
00:10:57,00:11:00,And it was Goya kind of got pulled into the Inquisition
00:11:00,00:11:01,because they were going after Godoy.
00:11:01,00:11:03,Really? That's amazing.
00:11:03,00:11:07,"It's a painting that has caused controversy for not just his period,"
00:11:07,00:11:08,but well long after his death.
00:11:08,00:11:12,"The 155 years well long. Well long, man."
00:11:12,00:11:17,"Bare long. He used to say people used to go to Godoy's house and go,"
00:11:17,00:11:20,that is a bad good painting. Do you think this is bad good?
00:11:20,00:11:28,"So many, many years later, it's issued in Spain as a stamp."
00:11:28,00:11:33,And this is suddenly the first stamp where there's a naked woman on a stamp.
00:11:33,00:11:36,"And in American, this is 1959, they banned it."
00:11:36,00:11:40,"So any letters that came into America, they said, we will not forward them on."
00:11:40,00:11:44,"There are a few cases where at the post office, they would actually just,"
00:11:44,00:11:47,"you know, they'd scrawled up the stamp, scrawled it over and stuff like that"
00:11:47,00:11:50,"and then send it on. But it was a huge, huge problem."
00:11:50,00:11:53,"That's amazing. Yeah, the letters returned because of, yeah."
00:11:53,00:11:56,"It's a time magazine wrote, an indecent picture is bad enough,"
00:11:56,00:11:59,but a postage stamp whose backside must be licked.
00:11:59,00:12:02,Millions of millions of innocent children collect stamps.
00:12:02,00:12:05,"And so, yeah, and there were certain places that kind of allowed it."
00:12:05,00:12:07,But eventually they did ban it entirely.
00:12:07,00:12:10,"It didn't have a picture of her bum on the back that you could lick, did it?"
00:12:10,00:12:11,No.
00:12:11,00:12:13,"So we don't know who the woman is in that painting,"
00:12:13,00:12:18,but there's a pretty good chance that it's at least partly based on the duchess
00:12:18,00:12:21,"of Alba, who was supposedly Gaius Mistras."
00:12:21,00:12:23,They were definitely very good friends.
00:12:23,00:12:24,We're not sure if they were.
00:12:24,00:12:28,But they were definitely good mates.
00:12:28,00:12:32,That sounded like an event.
00:12:32,00:12:34,They looked after a small bird together.
00:12:34,00:12:37,That sounded like an actual censor on our show that you said a swear word.
00:12:37,00:12:39,And it's now been whistled over.
00:12:39,00:12:43,"I thought now that we're possibly going on BBC Sounds, that I should not be saying fucking."
00:12:43,00:12:45,"Yeah, true."
00:12:45,00:12:48,"Anyway, the duchess of Alba's full name, actually,"
00:12:48,00:12:53,"was Donia Maria Dalpila Tareza, Caetana de Silva, Alvarez de Toledo"
00:12:53,00:12:58,"and Silva Bazan, Decimo Tercera Duchesa de Alba de Tomes,"
00:12:58,00:13:03,"Decimo Premiera Duchesa de Hosca, Sexta Duchesa de Montero,"
00:13:03,00:13:08,"Octava Candesa Duchesa de Alvarez, Decimo Premiera Marquiza del Capio,"
00:13:08,00:13:14,"Decimo Tercera Marquiza de Coria, Noneba Novena, I won't do them all."
00:13:14,00:13:17,It's 754 letters in total.
00:13:17,00:13:19,Her full name was.
00:13:19,00:13:22,Either we have to say this fact or we have to say all the other factors.
00:13:22,00:13:28,"So, yeah, and her descendant, who died in 2014,"
00:13:28,00:13:31,"who was actually a quite famous duchess of Alba, the one who was in the painting"
00:13:31,00:13:35,was a 13th and the one who died in 2014 was in the Guinness World Records
00:13:35,00:13:38,as the aristocrat with most titles.
00:13:38,00:13:39,She was a bit of an eccentric.
00:13:39,00:13:44,"Yeah, and the duchess of Alba, who's in the painting."
00:13:44,00:13:47,There's interesting thing about her is she was one of the most powerful people
00:13:47,00:13:51,"because she was also supposedly the mistress of Godoy, the prime minister."
00:13:51,00:13:55,"But she had a bit of a beef with Maria Louisa,"
00:13:55,00:13:58,who was the queen consort who was married to Charles IV.
00:13:58,00:14:00,These were the two most powerful women
00:14:00,00:14:02,"and they really, really hated each other."
00:14:02,00:14:06,And one day the queen consort was going to go to a party
00:14:06,00:14:09,and the duchess of Alba found out what she was going to wear
00:14:09,00:14:14,and got all of her maids to wear exactly the same clothes as the Countess
00:14:14,00:14:15,and go to the party.
00:14:15,00:14:19,So suddenly there were like 20 women all wearing exactly the same clothes.
00:14:19,00:14:21,That could be seen as flattery.
00:14:21,00:14:23,It wasn't. It was seen as famously women.
00:14:23,00:14:26,"Hey, that it was seen as a massive, massive slap."
00:14:27,00:14:30,Do they women you say they don't like that?
00:14:30,00:14:34,"It was seen as a massive, massive slam, so much so that we think"
00:14:34,00:14:38,that the queen consort had the duchess of Alba murdered for that.
00:14:38,00:14:40,"Oh, wow. Wow."
00:14:40,00:14:42,For getting her maids to wear the same clothes.
00:14:42,00:14:43,That is a magical joke on wrong.
00:14:43,00:14:46,Yeah. So I'm now terrified because sometimes me and Anne come
00:14:46,00:14:50,into the office wearing the same jumper with a cuddly animal featured on the front.
00:14:50,00:14:51,Yeah. Do you think she's plotting my demise?
00:14:51,00:14:52,I feel like she might be.
00:14:52,00:14:55,"Actually, they exhumed her body in 1945."
00:14:55,00:14:57,They think she probably died.
00:14:58,00:15:00,Yeah.
00:15:00,00:15:03,"She probably died of meningitis, we think, after being murdered."
00:15:03,00:15:05,But that was the story for hundreds of years.
00:15:05,00:15:06,That's what happened. That's amazing.
00:15:06,00:15:10,The number of paintings by Goya is going down and down by the day.
00:15:10,00:15:11,Right. It's a real.
00:15:11,00:15:13,I'd be more surprised if it was going up.
00:15:13,00:15:20,I suppose sometimes you find paint.
00:15:20,00:15:21,"No, that is true."
00:15:21,00:15:23,You do just got the lost paintings.
00:15:23,00:15:25,You might have had another like a shed or something
00:15:25,00:15:26,that he painted all over that we haven't discovered yet.
00:15:26,00:15:27,Absolutely.
00:15:27,00:15:29,"You might have had a second home that he rented out as an Airbnb,"
00:15:29,00:15:32,but then it turns out that it had paintings on it.
00:15:32,00:15:34,Yeah. But none of these things are true.
00:15:34,00:15:34,That's what we're saying.
00:15:34,00:15:37,"Well, I think what we're saying is we don't know."
00:15:37,00:15:37,We just don't know.
00:15:37,00:15:41,"If you're staying in an Airbnb with disturbing paintings on the wall,"
00:15:41,00:15:43,get in touch. That's about every Airbnb.
00:15:43,00:15:46,We haven't stayed in like a tastefully decorated Airbnb.
00:15:46,00:15:49,You need to up your budget very slightly at least.
00:15:49,00:15:51,It's a lower class Gabby.
00:15:51,00:15:56,So this is because basically lots of paintings
00:15:56,00:15:58,that we thought were by him turn out not to be by him.
00:15:58,00:15:59,"Oh, really?"
00:15:59,00:16:01,"And when, you know, modern analysis is done,"
00:16:01,00:16:03,it looks very closely at brushstrokes
00:16:03,00:16:05,and the type of materials that we used
00:16:05,00:16:07,and they make certain deductions.
00:16:07,00:16:08,"I'm always skeptical, you know."
00:16:08,00:16:12,"So there's actually one of his most famous paintings, Colossus."
00:16:12,00:16:14,They now think was not painted by him.
00:16:14,00:16:17,And there's one expert called Manuela Mena.
00:16:17,00:16:20,And she says that the brushstrokes are inferior
00:16:20,00:16:21,to what he would have done.
00:16:21,00:16:24,You can tell that the confidence with which they were made
00:16:24,00:16:25,is not an expert.
00:16:25,00:16:27,And you think he could just be having a bad day?
00:16:27,00:16:30,"Can I just say, if people in the like 200 years,"
00:16:30,00:16:33,"they listened to episode 183 of the podcast,"
00:16:33,00:16:34,they weren't very funny in that one.
00:16:34,00:16:37,So I don't think it was them.
00:16:37,00:16:40,That's that AI thing jumping over their voices.
00:16:40,00:16:47,"OK, it is time for fact number two."
00:16:47,00:16:48,And that is my fact.
00:16:48,00:16:50,My fact this week is that before governments
00:16:50,00:16:52,"experienced cyber attacks,"
00:16:52,00:16:55,they had to deal with fax attacks.
00:16:55,00:16:56,"Oh, what a great name."
00:16:56,00:16:58,Alternative podcast.
00:16:58,00:16:58,Fax attack.
00:16:58,00:16:59,Fax attack.
00:16:59,00:17:01,"Oh, yeah, that's true, yeah."
00:17:01,00:17:03,So this is a thing that's called a black fax.
00:17:03,00:17:05,"And people would do this as pranks,"
00:17:05,00:17:07,but they would do it to companies that they hated.
00:17:07,00:17:08,They would do it to governments
00:17:08,00:17:12,where they would basically send over black paper from their side.
00:17:12,00:17:14,"And often they would do, they would loop it around."
00:17:14,00:17:18,So their fax machine was just sort of eternally
00:17:18,00:17:19,sending a fully black page.
00:17:19,00:17:20,Like a conveyor belt.
00:17:20,00:17:22,"Like a conveyor belt, exactly."
00:17:22,00:17:23,"And so the people receiving it,"
00:17:23,00:17:25,"if they were not near their fax machine,"
00:17:25,00:17:28,suddenly they would be using all the ink up
00:17:28,00:17:31,or they might even heat the machine up so much
00:17:31,00:17:33,because so much of it was processing the load ages.
00:17:33,00:17:35,It would overload and it would sort of just.
00:17:35,00:17:37,I suppose also means you can't use the fax
00:17:37,00:17:39,while that's happening. Exactly.
00:17:39,00:17:40,"We should say, because people will write in,"
00:17:40,00:17:43,probably not ink so much as thermal paper.
00:17:43,00:17:44,"Yes, sorry, yes."
00:17:44,00:17:47,But I love already the people who would have written in
00:17:47,00:17:48,to complain about that.
00:17:48,00:17:49,I'm sorry we corrected ourselves
00:17:49,00:17:51,because I want to know you better.
00:17:52,00:17:55,Send your faxes to podcast@qi.com.
00:17:55,00:17:57,"So yeah, it's a method that was done"
00:17:57,00:18:00,"and it was done, you know, before cybercrime."
00:18:00,00:18:03,If we're being sort of talking about it loosely
00:18:03,00:18:07,"because there are always examples of like the 1700s,"
00:18:07,00:18:08,a version of cyber attack.
00:18:08,00:18:10,"Yeah, they say the first one was like 1834,"
00:18:10,00:18:11,it was supposed to be the first cyber crime.
00:18:11,00:18:12,What was that then?
00:18:12,00:18:14,"Well, it was in France"
00:18:14,00:18:15,and it was obviously before the internet was invented
00:18:15,00:18:19,"and it was a way of, sorry."
00:18:19,00:18:21,"Because these days, they might not know."
00:18:21,00:18:27,"In those days, financial market data was,"
00:18:27,00:18:28,"like trading was happening,"
00:18:28,00:18:30,but it was sort of done via like letter.
00:18:30,00:18:32,"So if you were in a different town,"
00:18:32,00:18:34,like the information would travel quite slowly
00:18:34,00:18:35,and people were always trying to find a way
00:18:35,00:18:36,to beat that information
00:18:36,00:18:37,and people tried like carrier pigeons
00:18:37,00:18:39,and all sorts of stuff like this.
00:18:39,00:18:40,But one way it wasn't communicated
00:18:40,00:18:41,"was the telegraph system,"
00:18:41,00:18:43,which was used for other things.
00:18:43,00:18:45,"But these two brothers, the Blanc brothers,"
00:18:45,00:18:49,they set up a ruse with some of the telegraph
00:18:49,00:18:50,operators where they smuggled
00:18:50,00:18:53,little information indicators in other messages.
00:18:53,00:18:54,But the way the hack worked was that
00:18:54,00:18:56,"the information would be like a single character,"
00:18:56,00:18:58,like I suppose U for up or D for down
00:18:58,00:18:59,or something like that
00:18:59,00:19:01,to indicate something to do with the stock market.
00:19:01,00:19:02,But then if you followed that
00:19:02,00:19:03,"with a backspace character,"
00:19:03,00:19:05,it meant that it wouldn't get written down
00:19:05,00:19:06,'cause it would be regarded as a mistake.
00:19:06,00:19:08,But the telegraph operator would see it all.
00:19:08,00:19:09,"So if they were in on it,"
00:19:09,00:19:11,"they could write down and be like,"
00:19:11,00:19:12,"""Yeah, it's sent over as a mistake,"
00:19:12,00:19:13,"we're not writing it down,"
00:19:13,00:19:14,"but this is the information."""
00:19:14,00:19:16,And the idea being that you know
00:19:16,00:19:18,if the price of gold has gone down
00:19:18,00:19:19,you could sell it for anyone else.
00:19:19,00:19:20,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:19:20,00:19:21,"Yeah, yeah."
00:19:21,00:19:22,- That's clever.
00:19:22,00:19:23,"Do you think, obviously,"
00:19:23,00:19:24,who was the modern artist we mentioned earlier?
00:19:24,00:19:26,Was it Roscoe who did all the black paintings?
00:19:26,00:19:27,"- Oh, Maljevic."
00:19:27,00:19:28,- There's Maljevic.
00:19:28,00:19:30,All good when he tries to fax the photos
00:19:30,00:19:32,of his new artworks crew.
00:19:32,00:19:34,I keep trying to send it to you.
00:19:34,00:19:35,What?
00:19:35,00:19:36,Stop pranking us.
00:19:36,00:19:37,"- It's twice worth so much,"
00:19:37,00:19:38,it's just the ink.
00:19:38,00:19:40,"- No, it's not black."
00:19:40,00:19:41,It's the Duchess of Alba's name
00:19:41,00:19:42,in very small fonts.
00:19:42,00:19:46,(all laughing)
00:19:46,00:19:48,"- Do you know who, as of 2017,"
00:19:48,00:19:49,"so I don't know if it's changed,"
00:19:49,00:19:51,"but the last report that I saw, 2017,"
00:19:51,00:19:55,was the biggest purchasers of fax machines in the UK.
00:19:55,00:19:56,- NHS.
00:19:56,00:19:57,- NHS.
00:19:57,00:19:57,- It's the NHS.
00:19:57,00:19:58,- Yeah.
00:19:58,00:19:59,"- Yeah, so interesting."
00:19:59,00:20:02,- They've really phased it out since then.
00:20:02,00:20:03,"I think, haven't they?"
00:20:03,00:20:04,There was a big scandal a couple of years ago.
00:20:04,00:20:05,"- Yeah, it was controversial, I remember."
00:20:05,00:20:06,"- They were like, ""We've got to stop."""
00:20:06,00:20:07,- Yeah.
00:20:07,00:20:08,(all laughing)
00:20:08,00:20:09,"- Yeah, and pages as well, wasn't it?"
00:20:09,00:20:10,- Yeah.
00:20:10,00:20:11,- I think they decided they wanted to get rid of them all.
00:20:11,00:20:14,"- Also, the NHS still have a big dictaphone tradition,"
00:20:14,00:20:16,"where a lot of the older doctors still,"
00:20:16,00:20:17,instead of--
00:20:17,00:20:18,- Why don't they just use their fingers?
00:20:18,00:20:21,(all laughing)
00:20:21,00:20:23,- That's one of my favorite jokes.
00:20:23,00:20:25,"- It's really a joke, it's a great joke."
00:20:25,00:20:26,It's great.
00:20:26,00:20:27,"- Sorry, as you were saying."
00:20:27,00:20:29,"- No, just that loads of doctors still"
00:20:29,00:20:30,"will be able to log in to the usual NHS account,"
00:20:30,00:20:31,"and when you go to the doctor,"
00:20:31,00:20:32,they'll make your medical notes
00:20:32,00:20:34,and just put them into the system.
00:20:34,00:20:37,"A lot of older doctors still prefer to use dictaphones,"
00:20:37,00:20:40,i.e. manual dictaphones with actual tape cassette tapes
00:20:40,00:20:42,"inside, dictate the notes,"
00:20:42,00:20:43,and then they're sent away
00:20:43,00:20:45,"to a third-party transcription service,"
00:20:45,00:20:46,"and then the notes are sent back,"
00:20:46,00:20:48,"and then the doctors then check them,"
00:20:48,00:20:49,"like the written notes,"
00:20:49,00:20:50,and then they're inputted to the system
00:20:50,00:20:51,"by someone else,"
00:20:51,00:20:52,and it's an insanely inefficient system.
00:20:52,00:20:54,"- You've got to feel bad about that,"
00:20:54,00:20:56,"surely, doctors. - Yeah, it's ridiculous."
00:20:56,00:20:58,- Miley Cyrus uses fax machines.
00:20:58,00:20:59,- Okay.
00:20:59,00:21:00,- Is this-- - What for?
00:21:00,00:21:02,- For communicating?
00:21:02,00:21:03,"- Everything, really."
00:21:03,00:21:05,"- No, only with one person."
00:21:05,00:21:07,"She uses them to communicate with her godmother,"
00:21:07,00:21:09,"Dolly Parton, because Dolly Parton"
00:21:09,00:21:11,actually does use them for everything.
00:21:11,00:21:12,- Why?
00:21:12,00:21:14,"- She refuses to use text messaging,"
00:21:14,00:21:16,and instead uses a fax machine for everything.
00:21:16,00:21:17,- Really? - Yeah.
00:21:17,00:21:18,"- You really buried the lead there,"
00:21:18,00:21:19,"but you were trying to get the kids in by saying,"
00:21:19,00:21:22,"""Miley Cyrus uses sometimes his fax machine"
00:21:22,00:21:23,"""for Dolly Parton, that's amazing."""
00:21:23,00:21:24,"- Yeah, Dolly said,"
00:21:24,00:21:26,"""I don't want to talk to everyone"
00:21:26,00:21:27,"""that wants to talk to me."
00:21:27,00:21:30,"""I don't text 'cause I don't want to have to answer."""
00:21:30,00:21:32,"So she thinks if people text her,"
00:21:32,00:21:33,"she'd have to reply all the time,"
00:21:33,00:21:34,"but with a fax machine,"
00:21:34,00:21:36,"she can just, like, get the messages and then--"
00:21:36,00:21:37,"- Yeah, it's very indirect."
00:21:37,00:21:39,"You can't do the three dots thing,"
00:21:39,00:21:40,or you don't get seen on a fax.
00:21:40,00:21:43,"- Yeah, but then it's still indirect this way,"
00:21:43,00:21:47,because Miley Cyrus says that she doesn't really fax.
00:21:47,00:21:48,She has a phone.
00:21:48,00:21:51,"What happens is Dolly Parton sends a fax,"
00:21:51,00:21:53,then somebody at the other end scans the fax
00:21:53,00:21:54,"to see what it says,"
00:21:54,00:21:56,and then writes it in a text message
00:21:56,00:21:58,that gets sent to Miley Cyrus.
00:21:58,00:22:00,"- Actually, the real leader of this fax"
00:22:00,00:22:03,is that somebody's job is sorting communications
00:22:03,00:22:05,between Miley Cyrus and Dolly Parton exclusively.
00:22:05,00:22:07,- Are you telling me you don't want that job?
00:22:07,00:22:08,- Of course I want that job.
00:22:08,00:22:09,- It must happen a lot.
00:22:09,00:22:11,I mentioned years ago on the podcast
00:22:11,00:22:13,that's how Brian Blessed would do his tweets.
00:22:13,00:22:15,"So, yeah, it's the exact same thing."
00:22:15,00:22:19,"He would be sent the tweets to reply to, to his agent,"
00:22:19,00:22:21,"fax it to him, he would fax back."
00:22:21,00:22:22,"Like, there was a whole fax system."
00:22:22,00:22:24,"- Did he write out the replies by hand,"
00:22:24,00:22:25,"which would then fax back,"
00:22:25,00:22:26,and then there would be times--
00:22:26,00:22:27,"- I can't remember now, yeah."
00:22:27,00:22:28,"- It went through, like, eight different modes"
00:22:28,00:22:29,of communication.
00:22:29,00:22:31,"- There was a lot, but maybe that's more,"
00:22:31,00:22:33,it can't just be Dolly and Brian Blessed.
00:22:33,00:22:35,"- Brian Blessed once tweet Miley Cyrus saying,"
00:22:35,00:22:38,"""Can you tell Dolly Parton to answer her phone?"""
00:22:38,00:22:40,"- I think it all had to go through the NHS in the end,"
00:22:40,00:22:43,that was where you were.
00:22:43,00:22:45,- Have you heard of the fax number of the beast?
00:22:45,00:22:47,"- Okay, six, six, six, something."
00:22:47,00:22:49,"- It's six, six, seven."
00:22:49,00:22:51,And it's quite just a little nice nugget
00:22:51,00:22:53,for phone numbers of faxes.
00:22:53,00:22:55,"- Oh, 'cause of course your fax number used to be"
00:22:55,00:22:58,"your phone number, but with one digit at the end,"
00:22:58,00:22:59,gone one up.
00:22:59,00:23:00,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:23:00,00:23:01,"Yeah, yeah."
00:23:01,00:23:03,"So, six, six, seven is the fax number of the beast."
00:23:03,00:23:04,"- Oh, I see."
00:23:04,00:23:06,"- I'm sorry, according to people who--"
00:23:06,00:23:07,"- I think it's a joke, right?"
00:23:07,00:23:08,It's a little joke.
00:23:08,00:23:09,- It's a joke.
00:23:09,00:23:10,"- Yeah, yeah, it's a joke, yeah."
00:23:10,00:23:11,"- Yeah, no, nice."
00:23:11,00:23:11,"I like, sorry."
00:23:11,00:23:12,(laughing)
00:23:12,00:23:14,I like jokes.
00:23:14,00:23:15,I'm the joke guy.
00:23:15,00:23:21,"- Before we had cyber, let's say urban legends"
00:23:21,00:23:24,"being sent through email and Facebook and stuff like that,"
00:23:24,00:23:26,they were all done on fax machines.
00:23:26,00:23:30,"And in 1993, there was a big scare in Memphis, Tennessee"
00:23:30,00:23:32,because there was a load of faxes going around
00:23:32,00:23:36,about gangs would drive around with the lights off
00:23:36,00:23:38,"in the cars, and if anyone flashed them to tell them"
00:23:38,00:23:41,"their lights were off, then they would chase them,"
00:23:41,00:23:43,"stop them, and kill them."
00:23:43,00:23:44,And obviously--
00:23:44,00:23:45,"- Oh my God, was this not true?"
00:23:45,00:23:46,'Cause I heard this rumor quite recently.
00:23:46,00:23:48,- It's just got to Anna's fax.
00:23:48,00:23:50,"- I mean, that still goes around that rumor, right?"
00:23:50,00:23:52,"But no, it is fake."
00:23:52,00:23:53,"- But it was called fax law,"
00:23:53,00:23:54,"the culture of sending faxes around,"
00:23:54,00:23:56,"and it was the old meme culture, I think."
00:23:56,00:23:57,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:23:57,00:23:59,"And when emails came along,"
00:23:59,00:24:03,it just went from fax to email directly from there to there.
00:24:03,00:24:05,"- So, fax law was the name for the rumors,"
00:24:05,00:24:06,the lies that were started.
00:24:06,00:24:07,"- Yeah, like folklore."
00:24:07,00:24:08,- Oh wow.
00:24:08,00:24:08,- I thank you.
00:24:08,00:24:12,"Again, I now get that that's a joke, fax law,"
00:24:12,00:24:12,to play on words.
00:24:12,00:24:13,- She likes jokes.
00:24:13,00:24:14,- She loves jokes.
00:24:14,00:24:15,- Ladies and gentlemen.
00:24:15,00:24:16,"- I'm a joke, aren't I?"
00:24:16,00:24:18,"- Oh, the last time I came on this podcast."
00:24:18,00:24:23,- Do you know who else used to fax each other
00:24:23,00:24:24,in the '80s?
00:24:24,00:24:25,"Well, loads of people."
00:24:25,00:24:26,- Give us a list.
00:24:26,00:24:27,- I'll give you a list.
00:24:27,00:24:29,- I framed that question badly.
00:24:29,00:24:31,I've got a better way of framing it.
00:24:31,00:24:33,"What was the, and pretend that,"
00:24:33,00:24:34,"I didn't ask that previous question,"
00:24:34,00:24:35,"'cause otherwise it'll give it away,"
00:24:35,00:24:38,what was the hotline between the White House
00:24:38,00:24:39,and the Kremlin?
00:24:39,00:24:41,- Was it a fax machine?
00:24:41,00:24:43,"- Dunno, I know you cheated there."
00:24:43,00:24:45,Probably using previous information.
00:24:45,00:24:47,- I always thought it was a red telephone.
00:24:47,00:24:48,"- It wasn't, a phone."
00:24:48,00:24:50,- That's Batman you're thinking of.
00:24:50,00:24:55,- I think that was part of where the rumor came from
00:24:55,00:24:56,"that the hotline was a phone,"
00:24:56,00:24:58,'cause I think it was in one of the Batman films
00:24:58,00:25:00,who speaks to the White House on the phone.
00:25:00,00:25:01,"Anyway, the hotline between the White House"
00:25:01,00:25:04,and the Kremlin famously started by Kennedy
00:25:04,00:25:06,"and Khrushchev in the '60s,"
00:25:06,00:25:08,"was never a telephone between them,"
00:25:08,00:25:11,but it was in the '80s a fax machine.
00:25:11,00:25:14,"So it started with type, so it was teletype,"
00:25:14,00:25:17,so it was basically like an old version of text
00:25:17,00:25:19,where you'd type a message if you're in the White House
00:25:19,00:25:21,or in fact in the Pentagon where it was.
00:25:21,00:25:23,"You'd type a message, it would be encrypted by people,"
00:25:23,00:25:26,sent to the Kremlin and then translated
00:25:26,00:25:28,by someone at the other end into Russian.
00:25:28,00:25:29,And it was quite sweet.
00:25:29,00:25:31,"The start of the Cold War,"
00:25:31,00:25:33,they swapped machines for this teletyping.
00:25:33,00:25:35,So the Kremlin posted to the US
00:25:35,00:25:37,four of their teletype machines
00:25:37,00:25:39,"that could print stuff out in Cyrillic,"
00:25:39,00:25:40,and the US posted back to the Kremlin
00:25:40,00:25:42,four of their machines.
00:25:42,00:25:45,And they upgraded to fax machines in the '80s.
00:25:45,00:25:47,"So in the 1980s, if there was an emergency"
00:25:47,00:25:50,"between Reagan and Gorbachev,"
00:25:50,00:25:51,then they faxed each other.
00:25:51,00:25:53,- There's many ways that people have to protect themselves
00:25:53,00:25:55,against cyber attacks these days.
00:25:55,00:25:58,"What do you reckon, this is now turning just into a quiz,"
00:25:58,00:25:59,the answer is not fax machine.
00:25:59,00:26:00,(laughing)
00:26:00,00:26:04,"What do you reckon, so like for the Navy,"
00:26:04,00:26:07,how they get by if they get cyber attacked
00:26:07,00:26:10,for let's say their GPS system is hit with malware
00:26:10,00:26:12,from an unknown enemy and that's how they're scrambled.
00:26:12,00:26:14,"- Okay, so you need to know which way to go,"
00:26:14,00:26:17,but your GPS is broken 'cause you've been hit by cyber.
00:26:17,00:26:19,"- Yep, you pop up and look at the stars in your periscope."
00:26:19,00:26:20,- That's what it is.
00:26:20,00:26:21,"- Oh shit, sorry."
00:26:21,00:26:23,- Celestial navigation.
00:26:23,00:26:25,"They're all taught celestial navigation, yeah."
00:26:25,00:26:27,- I'd make such a great submarine captain
00:26:27,00:26:29,"'cause that was my first thought and I was like,"
00:26:29,00:26:31,"I mean, I wouldn't know how to do it, but like."
00:26:31,00:26:34,"- Someone used to celestially navigate, thanks Alex."
00:26:34,00:26:35,- That's why the captain's there.
00:26:35,00:26:36,"- There's no such captain, I'm in charge,"
00:26:36,00:26:37,"I'm not actually doing anything,"
00:26:37,00:26:39,"I'm just telling you what to do, right Anna?"
00:26:39,00:26:40,"But like, think about how quickly"
00:26:40,00:26:43,I made that decision and who's right what.
00:26:43,00:26:44,"- Uh, go on."
00:26:44,00:26:45,"- No, no, it wasn't funny."
00:26:45,00:26:47,"- Oh, as she knows funny."
00:26:47,00:26:50,(laughing)
00:26:50,00:26:55,"- So, we mentioned the number of the beast earlier on."
00:26:55,00:26:56,- Yes.
00:26:56,00:26:56,- I've got a little quiz for you.
00:26:56,00:26:57,"- Oh, great."
00:26:57,00:26:58,"- Are the following things,"
00:26:58,00:27:00,are the names of cyber attacks
00:27:00,00:27:03,or the names of bands who have opened for Iron Maiden?
00:27:03,00:27:05,(laughing)
00:27:05,00:27:07,Let's go for Shady Rat.
00:27:07,00:27:09,- Shady Rat's a band surely.
00:27:09,00:27:10,"- Yeah, cyber attack."
00:27:10,00:27:11,- I'm gonna go cyber attack.
00:27:11,00:27:12,- It's a cyber attack.
00:27:12,00:27:13,- Wow.
00:27:13,00:27:15,"- In fact, it was a series of cyber attacks"
00:27:15,00:27:18,"in the late 2000s, originated from China."
00:27:18,00:27:20,Night Dragon.
00:27:20,00:27:21,- Cyber attack.
00:27:21,00:27:22,"- Band, cyber attack."
00:27:22,00:27:24,"- Oh, Dan, you suck at this so badly."
00:27:24,00:27:25,(laughing)
00:27:25,00:27:27,"Around the same time as Shady Rat,"
00:27:27,00:27:30,these were attacks on energy companies.
00:27:30,00:27:31,Nitro's use.
00:27:31,00:27:32,- Cyber attack.
00:27:32,00:27:33,- I'm gonna go band this time.
00:27:33,00:27:34,- Band.
00:27:34,00:27:35,- Cyber attack.
00:27:35,00:27:36,(laughing)
00:27:36,00:27:39,- I don't know how my brain works.
00:27:39,00:27:40,- Everyone knows Iron Maiden have a policy
00:27:40,00:27:42,of never having a supporting act.
00:27:42,00:27:44,(laughing)
00:27:44,00:27:47,- These were attacks on Iran by the US
00:27:47,00:27:49,that were planned if nuclear talks failed.
00:27:49,00:27:54,Let's go for Vinnie Vincent's invasion.
00:27:54,00:27:55,(laughing)
00:27:55,00:27:56,- I'm gonna say it's a band.
00:27:56,00:27:57,Surely it's a band.
00:27:57,00:27:58,- Yeah.
00:27:58,00:27:59,- That.
00:27:59,00:28:00,- Band.
00:28:00,00:28:01,(laughing)
00:28:01,00:28:02,- I am gonna say cyber attack.
00:28:02,00:28:03,"- Oh, I know you've lost it."
00:28:03,00:28:05,(cheering)
00:28:05,00:28:07,- I actually run out of cyber attacks now.
00:28:07,00:28:08,I did the ball at the top.
00:28:08,00:28:09,(laughing)
00:28:09,00:28:13,- I was looking at other like kind of non-digital ways
00:28:13,00:28:14,of hacking things.
00:28:14,00:28:17,"And did you, have you heard of token suckers?"
00:28:17,00:28:18,"So this was for many years,"
00:28:18,00:28:19,the New York subway ran on tokens.
00:28:19,00:28:23,"It was, you would buy tokens which would go into the slots"
00:28:23,00:28:23,to let you through the barriers.
00:28:23,00:28:25,And it was because I think the denominations
00:28:25,00:28:27,of coins never always matched up with the fares.
00:28:27,00:28:29,And there were people called token suckers
00:28:29,00:28:32,who would steal tokens by jamming up the slots
00:28:32,00:28:33,in the machine with a bit of paper
00:28:33,00:28:35,"so that when people put their token in,"
00:28:35,00:28:36,"they'd lose it, but it wouldn't go all the way in."
00:28:36,00:28:38,And then they would come back and they would
00:28:38,00:28:40,just crash down and suck the token out.
00:28:40,00:28:41,- With their mouth.
00:28:41,00:28:42,- With their mouth.
00:28:42,00:28:43,- Really?
00:28:43,00:28:44,- Yeah.
00:28:44,00:28:44,- It's a hell of a vacuum you've got on your mouth
00:28:44,00:28:46,if you can suck a coin out of a slot.
00:28:46,00:28:47,"- Yeah, I think if it's just inside,"
00:28:47,00:28:49,you can kind of try and get it.
00:28:49,00:28:51,- Maybe use your tongue to just soft wiggle it.
00:28:51,00:28:52,- Yeah.
00:28:52,00:28:53,"- You could take a hoover,"
00:28:53,00:28:55,you could take a vacuum cleaner to the station.
00:28:55,00:28:56,- Like a dice.
00:28:56,00:28:56,"- A little more suspicious, but yeah."
00:28:56,00:28:57,- I think you've had a tax attention.
00:28:57,00:28:59,"But they used to, some of the subway station attendants"
00:28:59,00:29:02,"would put chili powder in the slots as a deterrent,"
00:29:02,00:29:03,which is nice.
00:29:03,00:29:04,"- Yeah, that's nice."
00:29:04,00:29:07,- You could get half a tennis ball and stick it on
00:29:07,00:29:09,and then wham it and that creates a vacuum
00:29:09,00:29:10,"and then when you pull it off, it would suck it."
00:29:10,00:29:11,- Really?
00:29:11,00:29:12,- Yeah.
00:29:12,00:29:13,- That's good.
00:29:13,00:29:13,"- Or play at any plunger, I guess."
00:29:13,00:29:15,- Plunger would do the same job.
00:29:15,00:29:16,(laughing)
00:29:16,00:29:18,"- That was made twice, yeah?"
00:29:18,00:29:20,(upbeat music)
00:29:20,00:29:23,(upbeat music)
00:29:23,00:29:26,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:29:26,00:29:27,and that is Anna.
00:29:27,00:29:30,"- My fact this week is that for 200 years,"
00:29:30,00:29:34,"humans made wire by soaking steel in urine,"
00:29:34,00:29:37,but for realizing that water works just as well.
00:29:37,00:29:38,(laughing)
00:29:38,00:29:40,- We're so stupid.
00:29:40,00:29:41,- I love it.
00:29:41,00:29:41,- How recent was this?
00:29:41,00:29:43,It's just like last year we weren't the same.
00:29:43,00:29:47,"- Yeah, someone squatting down to urinate on the steel again"
00:29:47,00:29:50,"saying, ""We definitely not just put it under the towel."""
00:29:50,00:29:52,- What was the thought behind it?
00:29:52,00:29:54,"- Well, I read this in a great book actually called"
00:29:54,00:29:56,"How to Invent Everything,"
00:29:56,00:30:00,and the thought I think was that urine was used
00:30:00,00:30:03,"for various things historically, wasn't it?"
00:30:03,00:30:04,"The tanning industry springs to mind,"
00:30:04,00:30:05,"but going through the podcast archive,"
00:30:05,00:30:07,"it was used for millions of other things,"
00:30:07,00:30:11,"and so this was in Altena in Germany,"
00:30:11,00:30:13,"and it was in 1650,"
00:30:13,00:30:17,"and at that point to make wire out of steel,"
00:30:17,00:30:19,"you had to pull a steel rod,"
00:30:19,00:30:21,"so like a thicker rod of steel,"
00:30:21,00:30:24,"through a funnel of decreasing diameter,"
00:30:24,00:30:25,"so you know like when you did filtration in science,"
00:30:25,00:30:26,"you had those funnels,"
00:30:26,00:30:28,"and so you'd put steel in the wide end,"
00:30:28,00:30:31,"and you drag it through until it gets thinner and thinner,"
00:30:31,00:30:33,"and then you get a thin wire coming out the other end,"
00:30:33,00:30:35,"and to stop there being too much friction,"
00:30:35,00:30:37,"'cause you're putting it through really hard,"
00:30:37,00:30:38,"you use grease or oil,"
00:30:38,00:30:41,"and then in this place called Altena in Germany,"
00:30:41,00:30:44,"someone, according to reports from the time,"
00:30:44,00:30:47,"accidentally sort of urinated all over it,"
00:30:47,00:30:48,"and then tried it,"
00:30:48,00:30:52,"and found that it works just as well as the grease and oil,"
00:30:52,00:30:54,"and so I thought, oh, it must be something special"
00:30:54,00:30:55,about the wee.
00:30:55,00:30:58,"- I believe, I found something from quite near the time"
00:30:58,00:31:01,"that said that this guy who's called Johann Gerdis,"
00:31:01,00:31:06,he had been so annoyed that he couldn't draw it well enough
00:31:06,00:31:09,"that he'd thrown his material,"
00:31:09,00:31:13,(speaking in foreign language)
00:31:13,00:31:13,- Yes.
00:31:13,00:31:15,"- Which is where everyone casts their water,"
00:31:15,00:31:16,"so he didn't urinate on it,"
00:31:16,00:31:18,he got annoyed and threw it in the corner
00:31:18,00:31:19,into the tile and that's where.
00:31:19,00:31:22,"- Yeah, exactly, so he tossed it into the loo,"
00:31:22,00:31:24,"and then he thought, oh no, that was,"
00:31:24,00:31:26,"I threw a strop there, that was silly, wasn't I?"
00:31:26,00:31:27,"But I'll go and get it back,"
00:31:27,00:31:30,and so then he went and sort of got my elbow deep.
00:31:30,00:31:31,- Pissy metal back.
00:31:31,00:31:34,"- Exactly, climbed down into the vat of wee,"
00:31:34,00:31:36,"got it back out,"
00:31:36,00:31:38,"and then found that it works better, and--"
00:31:38,00:31:39,"- And when you say work better,"
00:31:39,00:31:41,is it just softer and more malleable?
00:31:41,00:31:43,"- Yeah, so what it seemed to do,"
00:31:43,00:31:46,"what it did do is make a soft coating around the metal,"
00:31:46,00:31:48,which reduces the friction when you pull it through.
00:31:48,00:31:51,"Now, we now do know that water also does that,"
00:31:51,00:31:52,"but for 200 years,"
00:31:52,00:31:53,people who worked in this factory
00:31:53,00:31:55,"would provide urine to it,"
00:31:55,00:31:56,and actually their wives and children
00:31:56,00:31:59,would also donate their urine to this factory.
00:31:59,00:32:00,"- I like the fact that they,"
00:32:00,00:32:03,"in between the wee and the water,"
00:32:03,00:32:05,they worked out that beer worked.
00:32:05,00:32:06,- Really?
00:32:06,00:32:08,"- So they did it with the wee for ages,"
00:32:08,00:32:10,"and then after about 100 years, someone tried beer,"
00:32:10,00:32:11,"they went, oh, this works just as well."
00:32:11,00:32:12,- That's so good.
00:32:12,00:32:13,- We don't need to whistle it.
00:32:13,00:32:16,"- Stop trying, try like 100 different things, yeah?"
00:32:16,00:32:17,- Maybe they did.
00:32:17,00:32:18,- I kind of wonder what else would work
00:32:18,00:32:19,that we haven't thought of yet.
00:32:19,00:32:20,- Yeah.
00:32:20,00:32:20,- Better than water.
00:32:20,00:32:22,"- I think once you've got to water,"
00:32:22,00:32:24,"it's like, okay, good, this is a simplest trick."
00:32:24,00:32:26,- I so love to have been there on the day
00:32:26,00:32:28,"that the person who came into town and said,"
00:32:28,00:32:29,"you know you can just use water,"
00:32:29,00:32:31,"so they've said that, so can you?"
00:32:31,00:32:32,"- Or like, dicks in hands."
00:32:32,00:32:34,(all laughing)
00:32:34,00:32:36,"- Standing here, dick in hand."
00:32:36,00:32:39,(all laughing)
00:32:39,00:32:40,- You've been so embarrassed.
00:32:40,00:32:41,How long have you been doing this?
00:32:41,00:32:43,200 years.
00:32:43,00:32:46,"- It's not important, doesn't matter."
00:32:46,00:32:47,- Yeah.
00:32:47,00:32:48,- Wow.
00:32:48,00:32:50,"- I think it's also interesting that you make,"
00:32:50,00:32:52,"why I like you make spaghetti,"
00:32:52,00:32:53,"you just squeeze it in a,"
00:32:53,00:32:55,"I mean, it might have pissed off my spaghetti."
00:32:55,00:32:57,"I mean, squeezing it through, squeezing it through her face."
00:32:57,00:32:58,"- Actually, if you could get it in water,"
00:32:58,00:32:59,it's even better.
00:32:59,00:33:02,(all laughing)
00:33:02,00:33:05,"- You know that smell that iron and steel has,"
00:33:05,00:33:06,"like doorknobs and stuff, you know that?"
00:33:06,00:33:07,- Oh yeah.
00:33:07,00:33:07,- That smell.
00:33:07,00:33:08,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:33:08,00:33:09,- The metal smell.
00:33:09,00:33:10,"- So you actually don't,"
00:33:10,00:33:12,"because it turns out that it doesn't smell,"
00:33:12,00:33:13,"and you know what it actually is,"
00:33:13,00:33:17,"is the oils and chemicals excreted by you,"
00:33:17,00:33:19,reacting with the surface of the metal.
00:33:19,00:33:20,"- Very similarly,"
00:33:20,00:33:21,"and every kitchen should have this,"
00:33:21,00:33:23,"I don't have this,"
00:33:23,00:33:25,but you can get stainless steel soap.
00:33:25,00:33:27,And I've never heard of that before.
00:33:27,00:33:28,- Oh.
00:33:28,00:33:28,- Yeah.
00:33:28,00:33:29,- What?
00:33:29,00:33:30,- Yeah.
00:33:30,00:33:31,"- Well, 'cause stainless steel is like antibacterial, right?"
00:33:31,00:33:32,"Which is why, like a lot of doorknobs are made out of it,"
00:33:32,00:33:33,and especially when you go into public toilets
00:33:33,00:33:35,"and stuff, everything's metal."
00:33:35,00:33:35,- Yeah.
00:33:35,00:33:37,- 'Cause bacteria can't last very long.
00:33:37,00:33:38,- So you don't need to wash your hands
00:33:38,00:33:39,when you're leaving the loo.
00:33:39,00:33:41,"You just turn the metal doorknob and you say,"
00:33:41,00:33:42,"""I've done it, as long as you do it both hands."""
00:33:42,00:33:44,"- You're not made of metal, Adam."
00:33:44,00:33:45,(all laughing)
00:33:45,00:33:47,"- Now, this is specifically for,"
00:33:47,00:33:49,"if you're cutting up onions or you're cutting up garlic,"
00:33:49,00:33:52,"and the smell gets stuck to your fingers,"
00:33:52,00:33:54,"and you're like, ""Oh, God, I smell of this."""
00:33:54,00:33:56,Rubbing your hands against stainless steel
00:33:56,00:33:59,creates a reaction that knocks out the smell from it.
00:33:59,00:34:02,"This is, I don't think it's scientifically proven at all,"
00:34:02,00:34:05,"but they do sell, as it were, bars of stainless steel soap."
00:34:05,00:34:07,- I actually think it is scientifically proven.
00:34:07,00:34:08,- What?
00:34:08,00:34:09,- But it doesn't really work.
00:34:09,00:34:10,- That's exactly it.
00:34:10,00:34:11,"- No, it's not, it's not actually practical."
00:34:11,00:34:13,"- But it's like, ""Nah, I've definitely rubbed"
00:34:13,00:34:15,"my garlicky fingers up and down,"
00:34:15,00:34:17,"stainless steel stuff to no avail."""
00:34:17,00:34:19,- And does real soap not work at all for garlic?
00:34:19,00:34:22,"- No, I don't think anything works for it,"
00:34:22,00:34:23,"except using garlic in a jar,"
00:34:23,00:34:26,which I've resorted to now in order to sustain my marriage.
00:34:26,00:34:29,- I think just being happy with smells of garlic.
00:34:29,00:34:31,"- All that, James, I wish life were that simple."
00:34:31,00:34:32,(all laughing)
00:34:32,00:34:34,- What a weird cryptic sentence about your marriage
00:34:34,00:34:36,that just slipped in there.
00:34:36,00:34:37,(all laughing)
00:34:37,00:34:39,- Anna's husband is a vampire.
00:34:39,00:34:42,(all laughing)
00:34:42,00:34:44,"- Can I give you a QI question,"
00:34:44,00:34:46,"but you've got to pretend you're in ancient Rome,"
00:34:46,00:34:47,and then it works.
00:34:47,00:34:49,"- Sure, do we have to do it in Latin?"
00:34:49,00:34:50,"- Yes, so that's okay."
00:34:50,00:34:52,I'm sure the listeners at home are fluent.
00:34:52,00:34:53,So--
00:34:53,00:34:54,- Shall we?
00:34:54,00:34:55,(all laughing)
00:34:55,00:34:58,"- Oh, no, Alex actually can do this."
00:34:58,00:35:00,- It's a guy studying Latin.
00:35:00,00:35:01,"- You only need to know one word,"
00:35:01,00:35:03,and that's the Latin word for steel.
00:35:03,00:35:05,"And astonishingly, they had a version of steel"
00:35:05,00:35:06,"as far back as then,"
00:35:06,00:35:09,"which was invented in India about 400 BC,"
00:35:09,00:35:12,but it wasn't able to be mass produced until the 19th century.
00:35:12,00:35:14,"But they did have it, made it to ancient Rome."
00:35:14,00:35:17,"The Latin word for steel is chalebe,"
00:35:17,00:35:20,and it was named after that chalebe's people
00:35:20,00:35:22,who lived on the Black Sea.
00:35:22,00:35:24,"Okay, so you're in Latin QI."
00:35:24,00:35:28,What did the chalebe's people invent?
00:35:28,00:35:31,"- The chalebe people, they made metal."
00:35:31,00:35:33,"- I mean, the Latin for steel is chalebe."
00:35:33,00:35:34,I'm just gonna say that.
00:35:34,00:35:35,"- Oh, okay, I see."
00:35:35,00:35:37,- Is it the word caliber?
00:35:37,00:35:40,"- X-caliber, swords."
00:35:40,00:35:41,"- Dan, can I get, I feel like you're the one"
00:35:41,00:35:43,who gives the more obvious stupid answer.
00:35:43,00:35:44,Can you do that now?
00:35:44,00:35:47,- I'm still busy trying to picture myself.
00:35:47,00:35:50,"What character I am, what do I know, what do I not know?"
00:35:50,00:35:51,"- Chalebe, and what there's supposed to be"
00:35:51,00:35:53,an obvious answer to this.
00:35:53,00:35:54,- They invented steel.
00:35:54,00:35:56,"- Oh, they invented steel."
00:35:56,00:35:57,Did they invent steel?
00:35:57,00:35:58,- And then you get a klaxon.
00:35:58,00:36:01,- They invented steel.
00:36:01,00:36:01,- I don't know what's going on.
00:36:01,00:36:04,"I think God, Anna didn't pitch QI to the BBC initially."
00:36:04,00:36:05,- It's a script editor.
00:36:05,00:36:07,I don't understand how she's made such a mess of this.
00:36:07,00:36:08,- I've rewritten all the scripts in Latin.
00:36:08,00:36:10,This is so awkward.
00:36:10,00:36:12,"I'm saying to a Latin audience,"
00:36:12,00:36:14,what did the chalebe's people invent?
00:36:14,00:36:16,"You know, speaking Latin,"
00:36:16,00:36:18,that chalebe is Latin for steel.
00:36:18,00:36:19,"- Okay, so it's steel."
00:36:19,00:36:20,"- Steel, woo, woo, woo."
00:36:20,00:36:22,"- Klaxon, okay, go ahead, okay, yeah, let me see."
00:36:22,00:36:23,"- And they didn't,"
00:36:23,00:36:25,they just invented another kind of hybrid iron.
00:36:25,00:36:27,"They had this kind of iron, steel."
00:36:27,00:36:30,- Do you wanna hear about the barbed wire was?
00:36:30,00:36:31,- Yes.
00:36:31,00:36:33,"- Okay, so barbed wire invented"
00:36:33,00:36:37,in 1873 in America by Joseph Glidden
00:36:37,00:36:40,and used by farmers to protect their farms.
00:36:40,00:36:42,Who was not happy about it?
00:36:42,00:36:44,- The blunt wire manufacturers.
00:36:44,00:36:45,(laughing)
00:36:45,00:36:47,"- Yeah, fence makers."
00:36:47,00:36:47,- Yeah.
00:36:47,00:36:49,"- Oh, yeah, that's true."
00:36:49,00:36:50,- Ramblers.
00:36:50,00:36:51,"- Ramblers, lots of ramblers in there."
00:36:51,00:36:52,- Golfers.
00:36:52,00:36:55,"- Golfers, yeah, these are all great answers."
00:36:55,00:36:57,But all wrong.
00:36:57,00:36:59,"- I actually feel like ramblers,"
00:36:59,00:37:01,"'cause I think I may know the answer,"
00:37:01,00:37:03,but ramblers might be a vaguely correct-ish.
00:37:03,00:37:05,"People who wanted to ramble, right?"
00:37:05,00:37:06,- I think it's true.
00:37:06,00:37:08,"I mean, not many people like barbed wire, I'd say, but."
00:37:08,00:37:11,"- The answer is cowboys,"
00:37:11,00:37:15,"because if you had a farm and you didn't have fences,"
00:37:15,00:37:18,"your cows and sheep could run anywhere,"
00:37:18,00:37:21,but you kept them in the right place by employing cowboys.
00:37:21,00:37:22,"But as soon as you had bad wire,"
00:37:22,00:37:24,you didn't need to employ cowboys anymore.
00:37:24,00:37:27,"- This is the first 18. - Who ramble freely,"
00:37:27,00:37:29,which is why I've given Alex half the points.
00:37:29,00:37:32,"- Rambles, they're on horses."
00:37:32,00:37:35,"- Yeah, I think of rambling as just sort of roaming free,"
00:37:35,00:37:36,but do you think it has to be on foot?
00:37:36,00:37:39,- I think what we're doing now is rambling.
00:37:39,00:37:40,"- But the other thing,"
00:37:40,00:37:42,"the other people didn't like it were small ranchers,"
00:37:42,00:37:44,because if you had a big ranch
00:37:44,00:37:46,"and you could afford loads of barbed wire,"
00:37:46,00:37:49,you could put loads of barbed wire around your farm.
00:37:49,00:37:50,"But actually, in those days,"
00:37:50,00:37:52,people weren't really sure where one farm stopped
00:37:52,00:37:54,and another farm started.
00:37:54,00:37:55,"So if you were a small rancher,"
00:37:55,00:37:58,you would often find that you would turn up to your ranch
00:37:58,00:37:58,and there's a load of barbed wire
00:37:58,00:38:00,and you couldn't get to your stuff anymore.
00:38:00,00:38:04,And so there was a huge amount of violence and tension
00:38:04,00:38:07,between these kind of small ranchers and the big ranchers.
00:38:07,00:38:09,And there were wire cutting groups
00:38:09,00:38:11,that would go out and cut all the wires.
00:38:11,00:38:12,"And actually Grover Cleveland,"
00:38:12,00:38:14,the president had to send in the army
00:38:14,00:38:17,to remove any unlawful barbed wire fences.
00:38:17,00:38:20,"- They formed sort of gangs, didn't they?"
00:38:20,00:38:21,With really fun names.
00:38:21,00:38:24,"They were called like the blue devils, the owls."
00:38:24,00:38:26,"- They supported Iron Maiden, didn't they?"
00:38:26,00:38:28,"- Sorry, you're right."
00:38:28,00:38:31,- Native Americans as well didn't like it
00:38:31,00:38:34,because it stopped buffaloes rambling.
00:38:34,00:38:39,I'm gonna make ramble happen.
00:38:39,00:38:42,And they depended so much on their livelihood for buffaloes.
00:38:42,00:38:43,It's one of the reasons that buffaloes
00:38:43,00:38:45,basically went extinct by the end of the century
00:38:45,00:38:47,is that they couldn't roam free anymore.
00:38:47,00:38:49,They were fenced in.
00:38:49,00:38:51,"And it was all kind of Lincoln's fault, wasn't it?"
00:38:51,00:38:52,"'Cause he signed this act,"
00:38:52,00:38:56,which said everyone can have a bunch of free land
00:38:56,00:38:58,in the Wild West if you agree to farm it.
00:38:58,00:38:59,So all these farmers moved there.
00:38:59,00:39:02,"And then we're like, how do we stop these buffaloes"
00:39:02,00:39:04,from trampling all over our crops?
00:39:04,00:39:05,- Bloody Lincoln.
00:39:05,00:39:06,"- Electric wire, right?"
00:39:06,00:39:08,After the barbed wire.
00:39:08,00:39:09,- Yeah.
00:39:09,00:39:10,- I'm just trying to think.
00:39:10,00:39:12,I wonder how many people died in that small town
00:39:12,00:39:14,who were having a nostalgic piss on a bit of wire.
00:39:14,00:39:16,(laughing)
00:39:16,00:39:20,"- I think that's a myth, isn't it?"
00:39:20,00:39:22,"If you piss on electric feds, you get electrocuted."
00:39:22,00:39:24,Don't try it at home.
00:39:24,00:39:24,Don't try it at home.
00:39:24,00:39:25,Who's got electric feds at home?
00:39:25,00:39:28,(laughing)
00:39:28,00:39:29,"- Get out of my room, Mum."
00:39:29,00:39:31,I did warn you.
00:39:31,00:39:32,(laughing)
00:39:32,00:39:34,"- I think the myth that I remember,"
00:39:34,00:39:36,"and again, I'm not sure that this is true,"
00:39:36,00:39:39,so people shouldn't try it at someone else's home.
00:39:39,00:39:43,But your urine stream isn't usually a complete stream.
00:39:43,00:39:44,It's usually got gaps in it enough
00:39:44,00:39:47,that the electricity can't travel up it.
00:39:47,00:39:49,- Did anyone come across
00:39:49,00:39:51,this Guardian Notes and Queries section?
00:39:51,00:39:52,"So you know, the Guardian notes and queries"
00:39:52,00:39:54,"and someone asks a question and lots of,"
00:39:54,00:39:57,often people who have inside knowledge answer underneath.
00:39:57,00:40:00,And there's one that's When Was Wire Invented.
00:40:00,00:40:02,Did any of you see this?
00:40:02,00:40:03,- No.
00:40:03,00:40:03,- It's just very confusing.
00:40:03,00:40:05,So there's When Was Wire Invented
00:40:05,00:40:08,and then various people underneath give their answers.
00:40:08,00:40:11,"And one of the answers is,"
00:40:11,00:40:14,fierce controversy surrounded the invention of wire.
00:40:14,00:40:16,And it goes on to explain that Thomas Malham
00:40:16,00:40:18,said he invented wire in 1830
00:40:18,00:40:20,at his foundry in Sheffield.
00:40:20,00:40:23,"But a Frenchman, Jean-François Martin,"
00:40:23,00:40:25,also said he'd invented wire at the same time.
00:40:25,00:40:27,There was this legal action
00:40:27,00:40:28,contesting the right to the patent.
00:40:28,00:40:30,It was never resolved 'cause Thomas Malham died
00:40:30,00:40:32,of an inflamed liver.
00:40:32,00:40:34,"And then it said, it's extraordinary fact."
00:40:34,00:40:37,"Thomas Malham's memorial is an Abney Park cemetery,"
00:40:37,00:40:38,"very near where I used to live,"
00:40:38,00:40:40,which has lots of amazing gravestones on it.
00:40:40,00:40:42,"And it's now rusted away,"
00:40:42,00:40:45,but it used to be constructed entirely of wire
00:40:45,00:40:47,in the shape of an anvil topped with a falcon.
00:40:47,00:40:50,"And the source was a book called Wire,"
00:40:50,00:40:54,It's History and Application by Dr. A. Stone.
00:40:54,00:40:56,(all laughing)
00:40:56,00:40:59,- It's a different material.
00:40:59,00:41:02,"- Well, it is a different material."
00:41:02,00:41:04,But there's nothing obviously in this to give away
00:41:04,00:41:05,that it's completely made up.
00:41:05,00:41:07,"It's completely made up. - Oh, it's completely made up."
00:41:07,00:41:08,"Oh, okay, fine."
00:41:08,00:41:10,- This person gives this extraordinary story
00:41:10,00:41:12,of the history of the Foundry of Wire.
00:41:12,00:41:13,"And I was like, brilliant, something fascinating."
00:41:13,00:41:15,"God, there's Abney Park."
00:41:15,00:41:16,I can't believe I never saw that.
00:41:16,00:41:17,- It's completely false.
00:41:17,00:41:19,"- So this is the story of you reading a comment section,"
00:41:19,00:41:21,finding the information ought to be true.
00:41:21,00:41:22,- It's not a comment section.
00:41:22,00:41:24,"It's Guardian Notes and Queries, okay?"
00:41:24,00:41:27,"You get highbrow experts replying to people about,"
00:41:27,00:41:29,and then practices. - But the joke is can slip in.
00:41:29,00:41:30,That's the problem.
00:41:30,00:41:32,"- Yeah, it's not a very good joke though, is it?"
00:41:32,00:41:33,"- I don't know, A. Stone."
00:41:33,00:41:34,- A. Stone?
00:41:34,00:41:37,"- Pretty good, I did laugh really hard at this."
00:41:37,00:41:38,- That's not a joke.
00:41:38,00:41:39,"I know jokes, guys."
00:41:39,00:41:42,(all laughing)
00:41:42,00:41:44,- Just on other things you can use your info.
00:41:44,00:41:46,Virgin Boy eggs.
00:41:46,00:41:47,"- Oh, yeah."
00:41:47,00:41:48,- Do you remember this?
00:41:48,00:41:49,- Virgin Boy eggs.
00:41:49,00:41:52,"- So they are a traditional dish from China, from Dongyang."
00:41:52,00:41:55,"And basically, it's exactly what it sounds like."
00:41:55,00:41:57,They boil eggs in the urine of young boys.
00:41:57,00:41:59,So like 10 or younger.
00:41:59,00:42:01,- That's not what Virgin Boy eggs sounds like.
00:42:01,00:42:02,That's gonna be 20.
00:42:02,00:42:04,"- It's what it translates with boy egg, fine."
00:42:04,00:42:05,"Like, again, urine boy eggs."
00:42:05,00:42:06,"You're absolutely right, yeah."
00:42:06,00:42:07,"- Urine boy eggs, got it."
00:42:07,00:42:08,"- You're trying to, sorry."
00:42:08,00:42:10,"They are, it translates as Virgin Boy eggs,"
00:42:10,00:42:12,Virgin Boy being like small boy eggs.
00:42:12,00:42:15,"And yeah, they, all through the town,"
00:42:15,00:42:16,"the kids are encouraged to,"
00:42:16,00:42:17,"when they go to the loon schools,"
00:42:17,00:42:19,they either can go to the normal toilet
00:42:19,00:42:21,or they can go and pee in like a collection bucket
00:42:21,00:42:22,in the corridor.
00:42:22,00:42:27,And then all of this urine gets taken
00:42:27,00:42:28,and then eggs are boiled in them.
00:42:28,00:42:31,And it's a whole process where like they're double boiled
00:42:31,00:42:32,in this urine and people eat them
00:42:32,00:42:33,and it's like a delicacy.
00:42:33,00:42:36,"- Yeah, urine's been used like that for a lot, hasn't it?"
00:42:36,00:42:37,"- Yeah, it's interesting."
00:42:37,00:42:39,There is definitely like a legit ick factor there
00:42:39,00:42:40,"where I'm like, it's somebody else's urine"
00:42:40,00:42:42,that this has been cooked in.
00:42:42,00:42:43,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:42:43,00:42:43,- It's very interesting.
00:42:43,00:42:45,- They had 100 years eggs.
00:42:45,00:42:46,- 100 years eggs?
00:42:46,00:42:48,"- Yeah, they're like supposed to be 100 years old."
00:42:48,00:42:50,"They're not really 100 years old,"
00:42:50,00:42:51,but they are quite old.
00:42:51,00:42:51,"- Very old, yeah."
00:42:51,00:42:54,"- Yeah, and they just taste really sulfurous."
00:42:54,00:42:56,"- But they haven't been bathed in urine, have they?"
00:42:56,00:42:57,"- No, they're just standard."
00:42:57,00:42:58,"- They're just a different kind of weird egg, yeah."
00:42:58,00:43:00,"- It's the urine thing I don't like, yeah."
00:43:00,00:43:02,- I can talk about weird eggs that I've eaten.
00:43:02,00:43:03,"I had that at Balut, you know,"
00:43:03,00:43:07,"that has the baby chickens, the embryo of the chickens."
00:43:07,00:43:08,- Oh yeah.
00:43:08,00:43:09,"All right, so save it for your spin-off weird eggs"
00:43:09,00:43:13,"I've eaten podcast, which will run forever and ever."
00:43:13,00:43:14,"It's, they've actually poached me."
00:43:14,00:43:15,Poached me.
00:43:15,00:43:16,- Hey.
00:43:16,00:43:17,(laughing)
00:43:17,00:43:18,- The rest is weird eggs.
00:43:18,00:43:20,"This is you, go find your podcast."
00:43:20,00:43:22,(laughing)
00:43:22,00:43:25,It's me and Delia Smith just talking about weird eggs.
00:43:25,00:43:27,- Weird eggs.
00:43:27,00:43:29,(upbeat music)
00:43:29,00:43:35,"- Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,"
00:43:35,00:43:36,and that is Alex.
00:43:36,00:43:39,- My fact this week is that dragonfly wings
00:43:39,00:43:40,are equipped with tiny knives
00:43:40,00:43:43,that physically rip bacteria apart.
00:43:43,00:43:44,- What?
00:43:44,00:43:45,- Nice.
00:43:45,00:43:46,- It's amazing.
00:43:46,00:43:47,- Oh my God.
00:43:47,00:43:48,"- It's just, it's the property they have"
00:43:48,00:43:48,that keeps their wings clean.
00:43:48,00:43:49,- So clever.
00:43:49,00:43:50,- Can I ask a question?
00:43:50,00:43:51,- Yeah.
00:43:51,00:43:53,"- Alex, straight off the bat."
00:43:53,00:43:54,"I've currently got a chest infection,"
00:43:54,00:43:56,and I'm on antibiotics.
00:43:56,00:43:59,Could I instead chuck some dragonfly wings?
00:43:59,00:44:01,- That's such a great question.
00:44:01,00:44:05,- I don't want to answer that in case you die.
00:44:05,00:44:06,(laughing)
00:44:06,00:44:07,"- I thought you were gonna say,"
00:44:07,00:44:09,should I strap a series of knives to my arms
00:44:09,00:44:11,and flap them around?
00:44:11,00:44:11,- Yeah.
00:44:11,00:44:12,- All sort of option.
00:44:12,00:44:13,- I think probably not.
00:44:13,00:44:14,I think dragonflies are amazing
00:44:14,00:44:16,if humans use them as inspiration
00:44:16,00:44:18,"for scientific innovations so much,"
00:44:18,00:44:20,but one of the things that we are doing
00:44:20,00:44:22,"is trying to emulate this,"
00:44:22,00:44:23,"what's called, they're called nanopillars,"
00:44:23,00:44:26,"these tiny, tiny sort of blunt pillars"
00:44:26,00:44:27,"that are so, so small."
00:44:27,00:44:30,"They're 100,000th of the width of a human hair."
00:44:30,00:44:31,"I mean, so, so tiny."
00:44:31,00:44:33,"So bacteria literally lands on them,"
00:44:33,00:44:35,gets caught between two and gets ripped apart.
00:44:35,00:44:37,"I mean, it's absolutely astonishing how small it is."
00:44:37,00:44:38,- There's more than 10 billion of them
00:44:38,00:44:41,"per wing, basically, on each one."
00:44:41,00:44:41,- Absolutely mad.
00:44:41,00:44:42,- Yeah.
00:44:42,00:44:44,"And they're really, really good at destroying"
00:44:44,00:44:46,almost all bacteria that lands on them.
00:44:46,00:44:48,"So, there's a university in Melbourne, Australia"
00:44:48,00:44:51,who have successfully made a sort of plastic version.
00:44:51,00:44:54,"So, that could be the new stainless steel."
00:44:54,00:44:55,"You know, next time you go into your public bathroom,"
00:44:55,00:44:57,there'll be a plastic handle.
00:44:57,00:45:00,- So scientists have managed to make stuff that small?
00:45:00,00:45:01,- Yeah.
00:45:01,00:45:02,- Yeah.
00:45:02,00:45:03,- Well done.
00:45:03,00:45:04,- Well done.
00:45:04,00:45:05,- I don't know.
00:45:05,00:45:05,"- Well, you can see when they sort of,"
00:45:05,00:45:06,you can do novels on rice now.
00:45:06,00:45:09,- You know that that's quite different to having something
00:45:09,00:45:11,that there's 10 billion of them on a wing.
00:45:11,00:45:14,- I don't think they've been manually sharpening each one
00:45:14,00:45:16,"with a tiny, tiny set of carving knives or anything."
00:45:16,00:45:18,- I once pushed an electron
00:45:18,00:45:20,with a scanning tunneling microscope.
00:45:20,00:45:21,- Wow.
00:45:21,00:45:21,- Right.
00:45:21,00:45:24,And it took me about an hour and a half.
00:45:24,00:45:26,(laughing)
00:45:26,00:45:27,- It was quite a long time ago.
00:45:27,00:45:29,"No, just like to slightly other place"
00:45:29,00:45:30,to where it already was.
00:45:30,00:45:31,"Like, I just moved it."
00:45:31,00:45:32,- Can you just blown it?
00:45:32,00:45:33,"- No, 'cause it's an electron."
00:45:33,00:45:34,It's so small.
00:45:34,00:45:37,"So you have this little sort of, it's like a needle,"
00:45:37,00:45:39,but it says some kind of quantum effect.
00:45:39,00:45:40,I don't know.
00:45:40,00:45:42,"I did study it, but I don't really understand it."
00:45:42,00:45:44,But I had the machine and then it was like a computer game
00:45:44,00:45:47,thing and you would kind of push this one electron.
00:45:47,00:45:48,And the idea was I need to.
00:45:48,00:45:49,"- Oh, they meant you to."
00:45:49,00:45:49,- Yeah.
00:45:49,00:45:50,- It wasn't like OCD.
00:45:50,00:45:51,"You didn't just, it's like walking in"
00:45:51,00:45:53,and seeing a painting slightly askew.
00:45:53,00:45:55,"You're like, oh, I'm really uncomfortable with that."
00:45:55,00:45:57,- I really like Princess and the P.E. too.
00:45:57,00:45:58,This place is such a mess.
00:45:58,00:46:01,(laughing)
00:46:02,00:46:05,"- But yeah, dragonflies are actually astonishing."
00:46:05,00:46:06,- They're incredible.
00:46:06,00:46:07,- They are amazing.
00:46:07,00:46:08,Every fact I learn about them is that you're
00:46:08,00:46:10,the most metal insane.
00:46:10,00:46:12,They are the most efficient killers in nature.
00:46:12,00:46:15,They are the most efficient predators.
00:46:15,00:46:18,"They kill over 95% of the prey that they chase,"
00:46:18,00:46:20,"which is like, that's unbelievable."
00:46:20,00:46:22,We're so lucky they're so small and they don't eat us.
00:46:22,00:46:23,- Yeah.
00:46:23,00:46:24,I love you called them the most metal.
00:46:24,00:46:25,They've opened for Iron Maiden.
00:46:25,00:46:27,(laughing)
00:46:27,00:46:30,"- When they're lava, so like little worm things,"
00:46:30,00:46:32,they kind of live underwater.
00:46:32,00:46:34,And then they shed the larval skin
00:46:34,00:46:36,and start to become a dragonfly.
00:46:36,00:46:39,"And they create these wings,"
00:46:39,00:46:41,but the wings are like made of jelly.
00:46:41,00:46:43,They're not like the wings that they have when they're older.
00:46:43,00:46:45,So they need to dry them out.
00:46:45,00:46:50,And so they produce sodium bicarbonate in the rectum
00:46:50,00:46:53,and they fart it out and it reacts with the water
00:46:53,00:46:56,"and it creates CO2 and it dries out their wings,"
00:46:56,00:46:58,which means that they become proper wings.
00:46:58,00:47:00,- They are their own hairdryer.
00:47:00,00:47:02,- Their ass is a hairdryer.
00:47:02,00:47:03,"- But also when they're lava,"
00:47:03,00:47:05,they eat through their anus as well.
00:47:05,00:47:07,And they also spend most of their lives as lava.
00:47:07,00:47:10,"So they can, some species live up to five years,"
00:47:10,00:47:11,but they spend nearly all of it as a lava.
00:47:11,00:47:12,And then they become a dragonfly
00:47:12,00:47:14,for just a couple of months and flying around.
00:47:14,00:47:16,"- I always think it's weird with, it's not weird at all,"
00:47:16,00:47:17,but it's unfair to these animals
00:47:17,00:47:19,that we think of them as dragonflies.
00:47:19,00:47:21,"When actually for almost all their life,"
00:47:21,00:47:22,they're not dragonflies at all.
00:47:22,00:47:24,- I think they want to be thought of as dragonflies
00:47:24,00:47:26,rather than these weird underwater insects.
00:47:26,00:47:28,"A bit creepy, yeah, yeah."
00:47:28,00:47:30,"It must be, I watched a great,"
00:47:30,00:47:31,I watched a couple of great documentaries actually about them.
00:47:31,00:47:34,One of them was talking about the extraordinary moment
00:47:34,00:47:37,"when they're climbing up a blade of sort of grass,"
00:47:37,00:47:38,which they would do when they're emerging
00:47:38,00:47:40,"from nymph phase into dragonfly phase,"
00:47:40,00:47:42,climb a blade of grass out of the water.
00:47:42,00:47:45,And that first time that you feel the weight of gravity
00:47:45,00:47:47,"on you, they've been floating in water all of their lives."
00:47:47,00:47:50,And suddenly they slow down massively
00:47:50,00:47:53,'cause it's suddenly having to wrench their body weight up.
00:47:53,00:47:55,And then if you watch videos of them emerging
00:47:55,00:47:57,"from the Exoskeleton, it's very cool."
00:47:57,00:48:01,"So their abdomen as a dragonfly is concertinid,"
00:48:01,00:48:05,just like a telescope inside of their larval cell.
00:48:05,00:48:06,"So when they burst out,"
00:48:06,00:48:08,suddenly it's like pulling a telescope out
00:48:08,00:48:10,to its full extension.
00:48:10,00:48:13,"And when they climb up, they can retreat at any point."
00:48:13,00:48:16,"So they're not dragonfly yet until their massive googly eyes,"
00:48:16,00:48:17,"you know, they've got this big eyes,"
00:48:17,00:48:20,until their eyes turn cloudy and white.
00:48:20,00:48:22,"And then once the eyes have gone milky,"
00:48:22,00:48:23,there's no going back.
00:48:23,00:48:25,"- Oh my God, that's incredible."
00:48:25,00:48:25,- That's awesome.
00:48:25,00:48:26,- That's how you can tell.
00:48:26,00:48:28,"- Wow, did you know they can't walk?"
00:48:28,00:48:31,"They've got six legs and they can climb with them,"
00:48:31,00:48:32,but they can't walk on them.
00:48:32,00:48:35,But they mostly use them to like grab their prey in mid air
00:48:35,00:48:37,and like stab it and like.
00:48:37,00:48:39,"- They're not called dragonwalks, Alex."
00:48:39,00:48:41,(laughing)
00:48:41,00:48:43,"- I feel it's weird having to like as in most,"
00:48:43,00:48:46,most flies and insects land or can also walk on there.
00:48:46,00:48:48,Let them use it to like stand and walk.
00:48:48,00:48:50,Whereas dragonflies specifically use it to grab
00:48:50,00:48:52,"and hunt them more like pincers, that's great."
00:48:52,00:48:54,- They're so awesome that the U.S. decided to create
00:48:54,00:48:59,"a spying dragonfly drone, which was based on"
00:48:59,00:49:01,all these amazing things that dragonflies could do.
00:49:01,00:49:04,So it had tiny beads that could reflect light
00:49:04,00:49:06,and could check for oscillations.
00:49:06,00:49:07,So you could work out what someone was saying
00:49:07,00:49:09,from a massive distance away.
00:49:09,00:49:12,It could flap its wings 1800 times per minute
00:49:12,00:49:16,using the lithium nitrate crystals controlled by lasers.
00:49:16,00:49:19,"It costs about $2 million for each ones,"
00:49:19,00:49:21,but they only ever tested it in lab conditions.
00:49:21,00:49:23,"And then when they took it out,"
00:49:23,00:49:24,they realized it couldn't cope with wind.
00:49:24,00:49:27,(laughing)
00:49:27,00:49:29,"- I found a documentary by David Attenborough,"
00:49:29,00:49:31,"which was called ""Dragons and Damsels""."
00:49:31,00:49:33,"He made it in 2019, it was a TV special."
00:49:33,00:49:35,And I really wanted to watch it.
00:49:35,00:49:37,"And so I was Googling ""Dragons and Damsels"""
00:49:37,00:49:39,to see where you could get it.
00:49:39,00:49:42,"Sadly, the closest I could get was a documentary"
00:49:42,00:49:46,"of similar length, about 45 minutes called ""Dragons and Damsels"","
00:49:46,00:49:49,released on YouTube by Buxton Civic Associations
00:49:49,00:49:51,during the pandemic and hosted by a chap called
00:49:51,00:49:56,"Richard Nisley Marple, which was really good as well."
00:49:56,00:49:58,And so I'm gonna tell you some things I've learned
00:49:58,00:49:59,"from ""Dragons and Damsels""."
00:49:59,00:50:02,The production quality's slightly lower.
00:50:02,00:50:04,"There were interruptions like,"
00:50:04,00:50:06,"""Can you see my cursor as I'm moving it out there?"""
00:50:06,00:50:08,(laughing)
00:50:08,00:50:10,"And sort of, ""Can everyone see me on the screen?"""
00:50:10,00:50:12,"or ""Can you see the thing I'm showing you?"""
00:50:12,00:50:13,But...
00:50:13,00:50:14,(laughing)
00:50:14,00:50:15,"- I'm never gonna, Attenborough doing that"
00:50:15,00:50:16,"or flying him out to the art, because they're like,"
00:50:16,00:50:17,"""Why can't I see them?"""
00:50:17,00:50:19,(laughing)
00:50:19,00:50:21,- But I would love to see Attenborough
00:50:21,00:50:23,doing a new narration over this documentary.
00:50:23,00:50:26,"""Here we see the human attempt, the cursor."""
00:50:26,00:50:28,"- Yes, the thumbnails have confused"
00:50:28,00:50:30,the good Jesus out of him.
00:50:30,00:50:31,- Was it good though?
00:50:31,00:50:32,- It was really good.
00:50:32,00:50:34,"So he said, ""Sweetly,"" he said,"
00:50:34,00:50:37,"""The Southern Hawker dragonfly."
00:50:37,00:50:39,"""They're the only dragonflies that will fly up to you"
00:50:39,00:50:41,"""and look you straight in the eye."""
00:50:41,00:50:41,- That's scary.
00:50:41,00:50:44,"- He said, ""It's quite frightening."""
00:50:44,00:50:46,"- Sounds like a U.S. drug, doesn't it really?"
00:50:46,00:50:47,- Maybe that's what they are.
00:50:47,00:50:49,They always have been.
00:50:49,00:50:50,"He said, ""The way to tell the difference"
00:50:50,00:50:52,"""between damselflies and dragonflies,"""
00:50:52,00:50:53,"where there are many ways,"
00:50:53,00:50:55,"but one of them is, and you have to look quite closely,"
00:50:55,00:50:58,"but during mating, they both grab the female from behind,"
00:50:58,00:51:02,"but dragonflies grab the female on the back of the head,"
00:51:02,00:51:05,whereas damsels grab the female on the back of the neck.
00:51:05,00:51:07,So you do have to be quite close.
00:51:07,00:51:10,(laughing)
00:51:10,00:51:12,"And also I really enjoyed a metaphor he used,"
00:51:12,00:51:14,"which actually referenced a fact that we mentioned before,"
00:51:14,00:51:17,which is that ancient dragonflies millions of years ago
00:51:17,00:51:19,were up to a meter wide.
00:51:19,00:51:21,"And as he said, you can imagine what sort of a mess"
00:51:21,00:51:22,that would make if it hit your windscreen.
00:51:22,00:51:24,(laughing)
00:51:24,00:51:26,I actually laughed out loud at that.
00:51:26,00:51:28,And I've never laughed out loud at David Attenborough.
00:51:28,00:51:30,- Or any of our jokes on this podcast yet.
00:51:30,00:51:31,- She knows jokes.
00:51:31,00:51:32,- She does.
00:51:32,00:51:33,- Anyone knows jokes.
00:51:33,00:51:35,"- But the female dragonflies also,"
00:51:35,00:51:37,they fake their deaths to avoid having sex sometimes.
00:51:37,00:51:38,- Yes.
00:51:38,00:51:39,"- Oh, they do do that, don't they?"
00:51:39,00:51:41,- And the other thing I know about dragonflies' sex
00:51:41,00:51:43,is that the males have spoon-shaped penises
00:51:43,00:51:46,so that they can scoop out sperm of the previous guy
00:51:46,00:51:47,if he finds any inside.
00:51:47,00:51:49,"- Ah, that is clever."
00:51:49,00:51:51,"Bit gross, but yeah."
00:51:51,00:51:52,"Well, no, but necessary, right?"
00:51:52,00:51:53,"- Well, yeah, I suppose so."
00:51:53,00:51:55,- Arguably humans have that as well.
00:51:55,00:51:56,"- Really, yeah."
00:51:56,00:51:57,- What?
00:51:57,00:51:59,The idea is that the bell-end shape at the top of a penis
00:51:59,00:52:03,could possibly be used to scrape out other people's semen.
00:52:03,00:52:07,"- Yeah, or just get a half-cut tennis ball"
00:52:07,00:52:10,and you can plunge that out.
00:52:10,00:52:14,"- I'm actually starting to question your fact now, Alex,"
00:52:14,00:52:16,"having just looked at my notes,"
00:52:16,00:52:19,'cause Anna previously gave us a fake fact from A Stone.
00:52:19,00:52:22,And your fact about an insect
00:52:22,00:52:24,comes from someone called a wolf.
00:52:24,00:52:25,- Really?
00:52:25,00:52:26,- Yeah.
00:52:26,00:52:29,It's Dr. Annalena Wolf.
00:52:29,00:52:31,"She does make this, there's this amazing point"
00:52:31,00:52:32,"that's made inside this article,"
00:52:32,00:52:34,"which you touched on earlier,"
00:52:34,00:52:36,which is basically all the things that we're looking for
00:52:36,00:52:39,"for modern invention,"
00:52:39,00:52:42,evolution has worked out somewhere on our planet.
00:52:42,00:52:43,We just need to look around
00:52:43,00:52:46,for a four billion years worth of evolution
00:52:46,00:52:47,and you eventually find something
00:52:47,00:52:51,"that can be then taken into the lab to try and mimic,"
00:52:51,00:52:52,which is pretty awesome.
00:52:52,00:52:54,"- It's the mimicking that's hard, I think, sometimes."
00:52:54,00:52:57,We actually don't have four billion years to make it.
00:52:57,00:52:59,We've got about a week before the funding dries up.
00:52:59,00:53:00,- Yeah.
00:53:00,00:53:00,(laughing)
00:53:00,00:53:03,But they've been around 300 million years.
00:53:03,00:53:05,Dinosaurs were walking the planet.
00:53:05,00:53:07,"I mean, that's always, 'cause in my head,"
00:53:07,00:53:08,the romanticism of the dinosaurs
00:53:08,00:53:10,"being just because of how old they were in alive,"
00:53:10,00:53:11,and we forget all these animals.
00:53:11,00:53:12,Dragonflies were there.
00:53:12,00:53:13,"- Sure, a different version."
00:53:13,00:53:16,- In fairness to people who make cartoons
00:53:16,00:53:18,"and dinosaur movies,"
00:53:18,00:53:20,they do often have dragonflies flying around.
00:53:20,00:53:21,"- They do, they do, that's true."
00:53:21,00:53:21,"- They do, that's true."
00:53:21,00:53:23,"- Dragonflies, yeah, that's so true."
00:53:23,00:53:23,- That is true.
00:53:23,00:53:24,- Yeah.
00:53:24,00:53:25,- One other incredible thing about them
00:53:25,00:53:28,"you wouldn't expect is how far they can fly,"
00:53:28,00:53:31,and that's another thing that scientists are looking into.
00:53:31,00:53:32,Can we replicate it?
00:53:32,00:53:34,'Cause the globe skimmer dragonfly
00:53:34,00:53:37,"has the record for the longest insect migration,"
00:53:37,00:53:40,"and it does a round trip of 18,000 kilometers."
00:53:40,00:53:41,- That is insane.
00:53:41,00:53:43,"It's always one of these things where I think,"
00:53:43,00:53:46,does it count if it's multi-generational?
00:53:46,00:53:48,"- Yeah, absolutely not, yeah."
00:53:48,00:53:50,"- 'Cause it is one of these things where the dragonfly,"
00:53:50,00:53:52,this particular dragonfly lays its eggs
00:53:52,00:53:54,"and lives and mates in shallow pools,"
00:53:54,00:53:56,"'cause the pools are warmer if they're shallow,"
00:53:56,00:53:57,and so it can grow faster.
00:53:57,00:54:00,"So it follows the rain, so it can follow shallow pools,"
00:54:00,00:54:03,"so it flies from India to Africa,"
00:54:03,00:54:06,and then the next generation flies back.
00:54:06,00:54:07,"- If I went on a gap here and then like,"
00:54:07,00:54:09,"I came back and it was my son,"
00:54:09,00:54:12,"like you wouldn't be like, ""How is Africa?"""
00:54:12,00:54:14,"Like, ""What was your dad?"""
00:54:14,00:54:16,- Alex is so well-traveled.
00:54:16,00:54:18,Alex and Alex Jr. together.
00:54:18,00:54:21,(upbeat music)
00:54:21,00:54:25,"- Okay, that is it."
