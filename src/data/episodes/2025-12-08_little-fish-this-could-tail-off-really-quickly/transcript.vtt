00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760
 (upbeat music)

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.900
 - Hello everyone, welcome to this week's episode

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.160
 of Little Fish Before We Start.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.120
 Andrew Hunter Murray has something he'd like to say to you all,

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.720
 just to keep his inbox from bulging quite so much.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.520
 - So this is a little, thanks James, hi everybody.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.120
 This is a little pre-apology and correction.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.960
 I run a small quiz in the middle of this show

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.920
 about the oldest ever James Bond.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.280
 I can't wait for you to hear it, it's really fun.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.400
 And in it we say, the two oldest James bonds,

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.480
 I won't give away which ones now,

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.640
 but I just like to point out,

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.480
 I do know that Sean Connery was 53

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.480
 when he was in, never say never again.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.280
 But it's not a canon Bond film,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.840
 it's not one of the official ones,

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.160
 which is why it's not included in the quiz.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.200
 I woke up sweating, realizing

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.480
 that I had not made this clear in the show itself

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.280
 all makes sense soon.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.120
 - Let it never be said that we don't take

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.760
 these silly little quizzes, extremely serious thing.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.960
 Seriously, there's a quiz about carrots coming up

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.160
 that is honestly the most serious quiz

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.320
 I've ever run on this show.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.320
 I'm so excited.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.120
 Too many spoilers ending.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.320
 - Sorry, yes.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.200
 If you would like to get more apologies, corrections,

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.280
 and bonus info, why not join Club Fish.

 This is our special secret members club.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.800
 We do a four nightly show called Doppers Align

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.840
 where you get this kind of sizzling

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.720
 behind the scenes hot goss about the show itself.

 Next announcement, before we start this week,

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.960
 let me show if you heard our episode,

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.720
 which went out a few days ago with none other than Michael Palin,

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.240
 then we got a little bit of an extra treat for you.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.240
 We filmed the whole thing and we put it up on YouTube.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.080
 - What?

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.640
 - Yeah, I'm sorry James, did you not know?

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.480
 - What?

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.200
 I was wearing my bikini the whole way through.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.040
 - Yes, I know.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.720
 It did, Michael did comment when you were out of the room.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.480
 He said, "What a friendly young lady that is."

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.480
 (laughing)

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.400
 Yeah, so we filmed the whole thing.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.520
 It's on YouTube.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.520
 You can see us, like, worshipping Michael Palin in real time.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.160
 It's great, it's great fun.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.360
 - Just go on to YouTube and search for our names

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.280
 or search for.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.280
 - No such thing as a fish.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.160
 - No such thing as a fish and I'm sure you'll find it.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.360
 - But for now, enjoy this little fish.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.560
 On with the podcast.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.160
 (upbeat music)

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.680
 (waves crashing)

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.280
 (upbeat music)

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:31.280
 - Hello and welcome to Little Fish.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.240
 This is our new weekly show where we read out your facts.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.720
 We've had enough of our facts.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.560
 Let's have some of yours.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.520
 You've been sending them in to podcast@QI.com

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.280
 and they are terrific.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.400
 And so we're gonna share some of the absolute cremd

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.000
 that I crem with you now.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.840
 Who's got a fact?

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.680
 Who would like to kick off?

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.600
 - I'm here, I'm here with Dan Shriver in James Harkin.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.440
 - Hey Andy.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.280
 - My name's Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.120
 Do I say all that?

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.040
 - I don't think I said that last week.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.880
 - Well.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.600
 - Last week I was here with Andrew Hunter Murray

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.480
 and Dan Shriver.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.320
 (laughing)

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.720
 - Great.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.480
 - And in case I forget to say it, next week,

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.920
 I will be with Andrew Hunter Murray in James Harkin.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.080
 - A great stroller gives a fact.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.600
 - All right, Gabe Bollard said, big fan of the show,

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.800
 I saw Dan post on Instagram that he found the book

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.760
 claiming to feature posthumous interviews

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.200
 with Elvis Presley's ghost.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.240
 How this is true is written by Hans Holzer,

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.400
 who is the person who sort of defined what a ghost hunter was

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.600
 and very much inspired Dan Acroid

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.480
 for ghost busters and so on.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.280
 He's added a fact that has nothing to do with that.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.520
 Says in the early 90s, when the United States Postal Service

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.760
 proposed issuing an Elvis Presley stamp,

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.080
 there was an effort to block it

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.200
 because someone must be dead in order to appear

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.200
 on a US postage stamp.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.880
 And Elvis, they said, was still alive.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.520
 (laughing)

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.360
 - That's wonderful.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.360
 - That's really good.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.200
 - That's nice.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.200
 - That is very funny.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.040
 That is a thing, isn't it?

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.320
 You have to be dead in order to be on a stamp.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.880
 - Definitely used to be the case.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:54.720
 - Yeah.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:55.560
 - I'm not sure it still is.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.880
 - So Neil Armstrong landing on the moon was okay

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.360
 because you couldn't see his face.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.560
 So it was a generic astronaut even though it was--

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.720
 - Such nonsense.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.560
 - Yeah.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.480
 - Clearly, just we're proud we put someone on the moon

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.440
 so we're gonna break the stamp rule.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.280
 - Yeah.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.120
 - So what that is?

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.960
 Like, well, they were saying,

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.440
 oh, it's an astronaut rather than Neil Armstrong.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.280
 - Yes.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.560
 - Well, what's the next astronaut's name?

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.360
 - Do you remember as well that that led to Buzz Aldrin's dad

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.080
 standing outside the White House with a placard

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.800
 that read, "My son stood on there too."

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.680
 - And it was him being furious there.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.880
 - Michael Collins' mum was there saying,

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.760
 Michael didn't actually stand on the moon,

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.480
 but he was just dead at a car driving around the ring

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.240
 around the White House.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.320
 (laughing)

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.400
 - Yeah, I think as well that one person in the UK

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.480
 did sneak onto a stamp accidentally who was still alive

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.880
 and that's Roger Taylor from Queen

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.280
 'cause they did a Freddie Mercury stamp

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.880
 but in the background, Taylor's drumming.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.920
 And so technically they have put someone--

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.440
 - But you are allowed the Queen on stamps.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.280
 - Compulsory.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.400
 - So a member of Queen feels fair as well.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.240
 - Yeah, brilliant.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.080
 - There we go.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.080
 - Are you sure you're allowed?

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.920
 Are you not?

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:02.920
 There's the rule the same in the UK

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:03.920
 that you can't be honest about unless you do.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.160
 - Again, I think it used to be.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.760
 I'm not sure if it still is now,

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.040
 but definitely used to be.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.560
 - We've lost so many of our traditions.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.560
 - Here is a fact.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.280
 - So this is from Chris Bemis.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.120
 And Chris Bemis says,

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.760
 "My fact is the largest shopping mall in the US,

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.120
 "Mall of America is kept warm in winter by human body heat."

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.360
 - Oh, so is that the humans who are shopping in the mall

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.440
 or is it a separate candle of trained humans

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.520
 who just go around being hot?

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.800
 - Do you remember in the last episode

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.520
 we said that you have very high body heat

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.880
 and so your watch runs faster than most people?

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:36.720
 - Yeah.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.640
 - They've people, a lot of people like you in the basement.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.920
 No, this is just people who are shopping.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.000
 And actually, like I saw a Reddit on this

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.440
 and they say that really the amount of heat

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.840
 that's given off by the human bodies

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.320
 is really, really negligible.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.200
 And while it does say on the website

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.480
 that the mall has no central heating

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.040
 and that it uses the body heat,

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.920
 they're quite cagey with what they actually say

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.120
 and probably all the individual stores

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.520
 have their own heating systems.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.160
 - We also have a huge coal fire burning in the centre.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.360
 So we don't have central heating, but we...

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.360
 So I think it's like, it's definitely claimed by the mall

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.960
 but whether it's 100% true, I'm not absolutely certain.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.600
 And also they have all these sky lights

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.480
 that this sunlight belongs out as well.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.240
 But here's a question for you.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.840
 Do you know in a few recent podcasts,

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.360
 I've been saying, I'll ask you a question

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.640
 and if you get the answer right,

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.480
 you'll get a million quid or 10 million quid.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.320
 - Yes.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.000
 - Well, I'm gonna do another one of those,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.640
 but I'm a bit wary that eventually

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.040
 you will get one of these right.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.160
 But for now, I'll give you 100 million quid.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.440
 - If you can tell me which country

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.520
 the world's largest mall is according to Wikipedia.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.200
 - Okay.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.240
 - Eritrea.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.080
 - No.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.920
 - Mexico.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.080
 - No, unlucky lads.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:49.920
 (laughing)

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.720
 - That goes into the pot for the next episode.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.600
 It's the Iran Mall in Tehran.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.080
 - Oh, no, no.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.560
 - The largest mall in the world.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.800
 - That's pretty good, is it?

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:00.640
 - Just very...

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.920
 - It's just bass, got hotels, it's got lots of,

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.680
 it's just got all sorts of stuff in there.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:05.520
 - Big mall.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:06.360
 - Big mall.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.200
 - Big or mall.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.200
 - Nice.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.040
 - I've got another fact.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.880
 - Go for it.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:10.720
 - Yeah.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.640
 - From Susanna Pate of British Carrots.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.680
 - Okay.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.200
 - This came in a little while ago.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.960
 - Sorry, you say plate of carrots.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.240
 - Sorry.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.080
 - Pate.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:19.920
 - Oh.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.120
 - Of British Carrots.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:21.960
 - Oh.

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:22.800
 - Okay.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:27.280
 - Her name is Susanna Pate, and she works for,

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.160
 I don't need to tell you guys who British Carrots are,

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.760
 but they're just, you know, for the international list.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.880
 - They're a trade body, whose main job is to get us all

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.080
 eating more carrots.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.560
 - Right.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.920
 - It's a hugely powerful organization.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.080
 Shadowey, I would say.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.640
 - Yeah.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:48.800
 - And she wrote because British Carrot Day was coming up.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.640
 - Okay.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:50.520
 - I was on the 3rd of October.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.920
 So we have missed it by quite some way.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:56.120
 But I just, I didn't want to leave, leave her out.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:56.960
 - Because...

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:57.800
 - Because of that.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:58.640
 - Yeah, because of us.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:59.560
 - You know, I love a carrot.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.400
 - Absolutely.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.000
 - Is it strange that, well, that national carrot day is

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.480
 in October, when presumably all the carrots have been

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.800
 well found by then?

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.400
 - James, I'd like to refer you to Susanna's email.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.240
 - Okay.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.680
 - Carrots are harvested 12 months of the year in the UK.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.080
 - Give me a break.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.960
 - So they, so they're one of the freshest and most versatile

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.040
 vegetables we can all enjoy.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.040
 That's according to Harry Strausson,

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.960
 who I presume grows carrots.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.640
 Anyway, I thought a couple of just little quiz questions

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:27.800
 based off her facts.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:28.640
 - Yeah.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.320
 - How many carrot seeds are sewn in Britain each year?

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.040
 - Um, each carrot seeds.

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.600
 - Oh, each carrot seeds each year.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:40.480
 If I get within 10 billion of this, I'll be astonished.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.320
 - Okay, okay.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.040
 - I'm gonna say 50 billion.

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:44.880
 Okay.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.040
 - Oh, I'm glad you're that high, because I was going high.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.440
 I was gonna say 200 billion.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.880
 - Well, it's 22 billion.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.480
 So down is that by a factor of 10.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.320
 - James got reasonably close to you.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.320
 - I mean, that didn't get close in the grand scheme of things.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.720
 - No, if they did plant 50 billion,

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.360
 we'd have an insane over capacity of carrots.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.600
 - That's not a world I want 11.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.520
 Walk along the street just waiting through carrots

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:06.600
 as you go to the office every day.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.440
 - All right.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.200
 - What is the total tonnage of carrots

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.840
 that those 22 billion seeds between them produce?

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.560
 So how many tons of carrots we're talking?

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:18.600
 22 billion seeds, how many tons of carrots?

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.040
 - Oh, I hate this quiz.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.520
 - It's fat quiz.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.200
 - I watched Richard Alston's House of Games

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.320
 for the first ever time this week.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.800
 No offense, I'd be because you were on it,

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.240
 and I didn't watch it where you were on it.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.080
 - Oh, I don't want it, don't worry.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.080
 - But they do this stuff, don't they?

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.080
 Where you have to just make a random guess on things.

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.600
 - Yeah, this is worse than House of Games.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.600
 I'm not afraid to admit that.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.440
 - Okay.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.600
 - All right, I'll go first, you go on first, last time.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.920
 - Okay.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.120
 - Six.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.760
 - Come on, play the game, mate.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.280
 - I ain't gonna go 100 billion.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.360
 - 100 billion.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.560
 - You think that every carrot seed

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.640
 produces five tons of carrots?

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:54.360
 - This is why you got invited down House of Games,

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.760
 and I did it.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.280
 Yeah, that's a good pipe.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.640
 - But this is good because now we're tied.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:01.840
 - Yeah, you're right.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:02.840
 I'm ready to bet you both that.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.720
 Well, I'll guess 700,000 tons,

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.240
 which is the correct answer.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.400
 - Oh, well done.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.320
 - And just out of interest,

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.240
 that would stretch 1.4 million miles

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.920
 if you put the carrots end to end.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.040
 - Great.

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:15.880
 - Okay, carry on.

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:16.720
 Next fact.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:17.560
 - Thank you, Ms. Plate.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.400
 - Paid.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.960
 - Only two questions in this quiz.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:25.040
 - Okay, one last question, what?

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.480
 - 1.9 million miles.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.520
 - Percentage.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:33.080
 - Of the carrots consumers by in the UK

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.200
 are grown in Britain.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.040
 - 38.

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.640
 - You think, okay, 38.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.800
 We're only 38% self-sufficient in carrots.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:39.640
 - Ah, interesting.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:40.880
 You said the word only there.

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:41.720
 Right, 9.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.040
 - Oh, James wins.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.360
 It's 97.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.200
 - That's good.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.040
 - I know.

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.760
 So there's almost no need to buy imported carrots.

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:51.600
 Almost.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.680
 So that's thank you, Susanna.

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:55.520
 - Very good.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.040
 - And if you work for like the wallboard

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.720
 or whatever podcast at qi.com.

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.840
 The cheese bar, they're always doing stuff, aren't they?

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:01.680
 - Yeah, brilliant.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.840
 - And we'll forward this app to Richard Osmond.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.000
 You should have a new job.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.560
 - Very same.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:10.960
 Tony Shane writes about a bond.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.200
 So a financial bond.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.040
 - Yeah.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.760
 - You buy a bond and it pays out a certain rate of interest

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.080
 for a certain number of years, right?

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.000
 And then when the bond returns,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.720
 you get all the original money you put in back.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:20.560
 - Yeah.

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:21.400
 - So I pay 100 quid.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:22.520
 I get three quid a year for 10 years

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:23.640
 and then I get 100 quid back.

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:24.560
 Pretty good deal.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:25.640
 And it's if companies or governments

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:27.800
 need to raise a lot of money initially

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.000
 and fund something.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.160
 - A war first time.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.000
 - A war.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:31.840
 - A war.

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:32.680
 - Well.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:36.880
 - There is a bond which was issued in 1648,

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:39.040
 which is still paying out.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.480
 (laughing)

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.800
 - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:45.080
 - It was issued in the Netherlands, 377 years ago.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.600
 Charles I was still alive in England.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.360
 And it was the water authority.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:53.960
 They issued a bond and it's still paying.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.160
 - But you said, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.000
 Like you knew this.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.760
 - I feel like we may have covered

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:58.600
 this.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.440
 - Oh really?

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.280
 - A long time ago on a show.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.120
 - I'm not familiar with it.

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:01.960
 - It's just stunning.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.080
 So the actual original bond is in Yale now.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.080
 It's passed through many hands over the centuries.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:07.840
 It's written on ghost kin.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:08.680
 - Oh wow.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:09.440
 - And it's so old.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.640
 And the number of water boards in the Netherlands

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.720
 just needed to raise money for something.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.280
 And this isn't even the oldest bond in the world

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.240
 that's still active.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.280
 There is one that was issued in 1624.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.960
 It had its 400th birthday last year.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.760
 It is still paying out.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:28.040
 And it was again, Dutch water utility.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.520
 They had this disaster where some drifting ice broke

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.920
 through a dike, huge problem in the Netherlands

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:34.560
 because it's all underwater.

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:35.640
 They needed to raise money.

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:38.080
 And this one pays about 13 euros still every year

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.680
 that you're the bond holder.

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.080
 - It's just so cool.

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:41.920
 - Yeah.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.480
 - I think I should set one up so people can send me money

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:47.560
 and I can become a spy or something.

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:48.680
 - Wait, are you issuing the bond?

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.120
 - Yeah, yeah, you'll be called the James Bond.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:51.960
 - Oh my god.

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.000
 - It was a funny God.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.600
 - I gave you a second to notice

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:55.960
 that you're walking into.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.200
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.040
 - All right.

00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.960
 Well, I actually did prepare a separate little quiz.

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:01.800
 Who was the oldest bond?

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:02.640
 - Oh.

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:03.480
 - As in James Bond.

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.200
 - James Bond, James Bond.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.400
 The oldest actor to play James Bond.

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:07.400
 - Not Jamal.

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:08.720
 - Correct.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.640
 Second oldest.

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:10.800
 - Daniel Craig.

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:11.840
 - Daniel Craig, correct.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:12.680
 Carry on.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.840
 (laughing)

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.040
 - Why is this quiz?

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.920
 - I'd sometimes, they're not all in parties.

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.280
 It's not all like how many carrot seeds are there

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.960
 in the UK every year.

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:25.760
 Sometimes it's just a little confidence builder.

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:29.680
 So Roger Moore was 57 when he hung up his false teeth

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.320
 and wagon all of that.

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.800
 And, but Daniel Craig was 51 when he stopped doing it.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.120
 - Yeah.

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.120
 - In that last bond first.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.120
 - Not massively surprised.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.160
 What about our lays and beef of number three?

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:40.520
 - I haven't written down any other.

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:41.360
 - Oh.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:42.360
 - Tonery?

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:45.640
 - I haven't written down any other names and ages.

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:46.920
 Should have done.

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:50.000
 - You probably didn't think we were going to get the first two

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.040
 so quickly, I guess.

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.760
 - I could have said I didn't.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:54.920
 - But, lays and beef, George lays and beef.

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:58.920
 I, someone painted my old flat years and years ago

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.360
 who had come, he'd, did I talk to his poor?

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.200
 - No.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:06.160
 - Andy, this would be the best anecdote you've ever told us.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:07.720
 Shall we remember it?

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:08.840
 (laughing)

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:09.680
 - Wait, wait, wait.

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.240
 This could tail off really quickly.

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.240
 (laughing)

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.480
 - Layson B's dead now, isn't he?

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:14.320
 He's dead.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.680
 - I don't think he is.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.120
 - I better not say it like that.

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.160
 (laughing)

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.120
 - Okay, let me see, let me see.

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:23.240
 - Melissa, imagine this anecdote, begins,

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:25.520
 a friend of mine was painting a flat,

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.160
 and ends with something just libelous against George,

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.840
 I didn't mean it.

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.360
 - He's very much going strong.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.200
 - Let's move on.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.040
 - Yeah.

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.360
 - I told you, I was going to tail off.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:37.960
 I told you, we trusted you.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:41.200
 He had such a front loaded it so well.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:44.200
 He supposedly got the gig of bond

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.200
 when he was having his hair done.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.880
 This is one of the stories that gets told.

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.760
 And one of the broccoli's was sitting next to him.

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.280
 - Big broccoli.

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.120
 - We're sitting next to him.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:53.960
 - It can be broccoli, the producer.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:54.960
 - Gaby broccoli, Barbara.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.360
 - Or Barbara, it could have been Barbara.

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.200
 - Yeah.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.120
 - And Layson, he shot him six times through the head, didn't he?

00:14:59.120 --> 00:14:59.960
 - Yes.

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:00.800
 - So you've got what it takes, kid.

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:01.800
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:05.240
 - He's also, do you remember that there was going to be

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:08.080
 a bond of a very different nature,

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:10.880
 a different kind of character, not strictly an actor?

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.680
 And he wasn't allowed to be bond in the end

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.680
 because his face looked a bit too much like a farmer's.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.800
 (laughing)

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.240
 - We've spoken about this on the podcast.

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.440
 It might have been a part of an edit.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.680
 - Someone's a bright blessed?

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:24.520
 - No.

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:25.280
 - You look too much like a farmer.

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:26.480
 Who looks like a farmer?

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:29.240
 - Interestingly, a book of theirs is right behind me,

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:32.040
 but you're sitting in front of 500 books.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.040
 - Wait a minute, I know, I'm Miller.

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.720
 (laughing)

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.960
 - It is Randall Finds.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:39.800
 - Oh yeah.

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:41.160
 - Remember Randall Finds went to auditions

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:42.000
 and was-- - He was in the running.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:42.840
 - Yeah.

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.400
 - I think it was either his hands look like a farmer

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.040
 or his face, one of the two.

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.620
 (upbeat music)

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:53.880
 - I've got one, Andrew Price.

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:57.120
 I'm a long-term listener living in North Carolina, USA,

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:58.600
 where I work as a nurse.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.520
 I'm sending you an article I found in the New York Times

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:03.440
 about a type of seabird, the Streaked Shearwater,

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:06.200
 and the article is headlined, "These majestic seabirds

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.520
 never stop pooping."

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:11.280
 And basically, scientists did an experiment

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:14.280
 on the Streaked Shearwater where they put cameras

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:17.840
 on the bottoms of the birds pointing backwards.

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.160
 And I think they were trying to work out

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.800
 something about their flight or their flight dynamics

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:22.720
 or something.

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.040
 But basically, what they found is,

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:26.840
 are these birds are constantly powing?

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.640
 It's extraordinary.

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.560
 It's 5% of their mass every hour.

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:33.400
 - Whoa.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:34.560
 - I know.

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:37.200
 And Andrew writes, "To put this into perspective,

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.200
 this would be like me pooping out an 11 pound poop."

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.520
 I don't like that word, poop.

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:45.360
 Every hour about the same weight as a normal house cat.

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.640
 (laughing)

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:51.720
 Or 132 pounds, the weight of two Dalmatians

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.080
 in the course of a 12 hour work day.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:54.920
 - Wow.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:56.160
 (laughing)

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:59.120
 - 50 and a half days, and you have 101 Dalmatians.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.720
 (laughing)

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.560
 - That's amazing.

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:05.240
 - That's very upsetting.

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.480
 What a bird.

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.320
 - What a bird.

00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:08.480
 What a bird.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:09.480
 (laughing)

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:10.720
 - Like you, Andrew, great fact.

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:11.720
 - Yeah, that's brilliant.

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:12.560
 - Well, Ma'am.

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:15.240
 - Yeah, I got actually another poo one to read out here.

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:17.800
 This was sent in by Liz May.

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:20.720
 And she says that this is an article she spotted.

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.320
 A woman in Australia has now been

00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:26.680
 in a year's long remission from severe bipolar disorder

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:29.560
 after receiving homemade fecal transplant

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.520
 animals from her husband.

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:32.680
 - Oh, boy.

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.560
 - Her case is one of the first in the world.

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:35.920
 It may lead to improved treatments

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:36.960
 for bipolar disorder.

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:37.960
 - I don't think it will.

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.200
 (laughing)

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.640
 - So sorry, homemade, I don't even know how you would,

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:43.000
 how you would think of home making

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.440
 a fecal transplant animal.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:45.440
 - Yeah.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.280
 - Yeah.

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:47.120
 - Do you know what I mean?

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.320
 It just wouldn't occur to me to, to do.

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:50.320
 - No, which bit.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:54.520
 - Home making, I suppose.

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:56.120
 - Like if I went to the doctor and he said,

00:17:56.120 --> 00:18:00.040
 look, it sounds crazy, but actually we think your microbiome

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:02.200
 might be maladjusted and we think maybe we can get it

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:05.240
 back into an equilibrium by doing this procedure.

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:07.280
 But I don't think they would then say,

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:08.560
 can you just go home and ask your,

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:11.000
 but would you rather have someone else's poo up there

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.720
 or would you rather have someone you know?

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.000
 - Or would you think someone else's?

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:14.840
 - Oh, really?

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:16.920
 - Yes, because I think.

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:18.240
 - Yeah, but that's because I have to keep,

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:22.040
 if it's someone close to you, like a partner,

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:23.360
 you have to look at them, I think it would,

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:25.720
 I think it takes a little of the spark out of a marriage.

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.240
 (laughing)

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:30.400
 - I'm wondering the circumstances in which you raise

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.480
 your idea, you know.

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:33.960
 - Oh, you've got to build up to it.

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.000
 That's baby steps.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 - You can't just go straight in and say,

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.320
 I think we should do this.

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:39.400
 - You've got to be like.

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:43.720
 - I wonder, I heard the Jones is at number 14

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.440
 and doing quite an interesting thing.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.400
 I don't say we should do it.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.840
 I just, I just, you know,

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:51.000
 it's something that kind of interests me a little bit.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.760
 - I guess we could try it.

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:57.120
 - We could try it.

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.520
 - For your birthday, maybe.

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:05.880
 - Great fact.

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.000
 - Well, great that it worked as well.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.280
 - Yeah. - Around the coats.

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:10.800
 - Rites, according to the Rale Shakespeare Company,

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:14.080
 50% of the world's children study Shakespeare.

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:14.920
 - Wow.

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:15.920
 - That's nice, isn't it?

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.320
 - That's great.

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:18.160
 - I got to say.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:19.000
 - It's good for Britain,

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.120
 because it gives us soft power around the world.

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.040
 - And all the plays are bloody good.

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:24.480
 - They are, they're really good.

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.400
 Shakespeare's one of those writers,

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.360
 whoever wants to, he's good.

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:29.520
 And then you read him and actually he's really good.

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:30.360
 - I'll leave you a tell.

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:32.040
 - Tell us more about the Shakespeare part.

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.520
 (laughing)

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:34.360
 - Give us more of that.

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.200
 - Well.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.200
 (laughing)

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:41.200
 The guy who decorated my hat had a really interesting story

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.940
 about Bill Beckton.

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:44.180
 - He is dead, I can say that much.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:45.640
 - Oh, well he said he was a wanker.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:48.240
 (laughing)

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:50.920
 - So this was a study done in 2014.

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:53.280
 Okay, and it also named Shakespeare

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:56.760
 as the most popular person associated with UK art

00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:58.760
 and culture in the world.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:02.560
 Can you name any other people who are on that list?

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:05.040
 And I have a list of 13 other people.

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:05.880

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:06.720
 - No.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.680
 - These are just any kind, any feel.

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:10.640
 - Anyone in the world associates them

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.320
 with UK art and culture.

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.160

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:15.900

 - Oh, Jane Austen?

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:18.800
 - No.

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:19.800
 - Oh my god.

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:21.360
 - That's way more likely to get these.

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:22.200
 - Okay.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.040
 - David Bowie.

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:23.960

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:27.920
 - Edmund Hillary is from New Zealand.

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:28.760
 - Oh yeah.

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.080
 (laughing)

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:33.400
 - Okay, Dan's way more likely to get this.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:36.480
 - So we're thinking of John Plees.

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.600
 - John Plees now.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:38.680
 - Freddie Mercury.

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:39.520
 - No.

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:41.480
 God, I genuinely thought you'd get a few more of these.

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:42.320
 - The Queen.

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:43.320
 - The Queen, yeah.

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:44.160

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.000
 - Queen.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:45.840
 - You kicked culture.

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:46.680
 - Well culture.

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.000
 - You're all so racing.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:48.840
 - I'm sorry to be a snobby,

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:52.000
 but she just didn't, do you mean the old queen?

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 - Queen Elizabeth II.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.600
 - Yeah, the true queen.

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:55.920
 - Yeah, yeah, go on.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.480
 Okay, so we had the Queen.

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:58.800
 We had Shakespeare.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.760
 - And we've had the Beatles.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:03.160
 - I'm telling you, I'll give you McCartney as well,

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:04.640
 'cause you said the Beatles.

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.480
 - Twiggy.

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:06.320

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:07.160
 - Twiggy.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:08.000
 - Sting.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:08.840
 - 2014.

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:10.080
 - No, such thing as a fish.

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:13.080
 (laughing)

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:15.480
 - They've got anaticity, so I'll give you that.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:16.320
 No, not that.

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:17.680
 - 2014, that's a clue, 2014.

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:18.840
 - It's true.

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:20.680
 - Similar on the way out.

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:21.520
 - No.

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:22.520
 - Dapper laughs.

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:24.800
 - More famous than Lily Allen for sure.

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:25.640
 - Endobs.

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:26.480

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:28.800
 (laughing)

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:29.960
 - And Dale is what I was saying before there.

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:30.800
 - Dale.

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:31.640
 - And Dale.

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:33.640

 - Beckham.

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:43.800

00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.160
 - Churchill.

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.000
 - Churchill, it just says Churchill.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:00.840
 I assume it's that.

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.360
 (laughing)

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:03.360
 Good quiz, guys.

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:04.200
 - It's pretty good.

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.040
 - Well done.

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.040
 - Wow, really good quiz.

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:09.400
 - I'm gonna call the Churchill, make it onto the dog.

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:11.320
 - The dog over the politics.

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:13.200
 - It will be Winston Churchill, I'm sure.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.040
 - I wish.

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:16.360
 - It's just always, I was just doing a funny.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.360
 - Let's go compare mere cats, play on that.

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:20.280
 - Anyway, John is next week, but.

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:21.520
 (laughing)

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:24.160
 John is next week for my quiz, Pollock Teap.

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.000
 (laughing)

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.360
 On the on channel five.

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:28.200
 - Oh.

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.240
 - Okay, well, I think we, oh, it's not,

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:31.520
 I'm not even hosting this, am I?

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:32.640
 - You are hosting this one.

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:33.480
 - Andy.

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:34.400
 - With me, yeah.

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:35.240
 - Yeah.

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:36.760
 - Don't you think we should maybe end

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:39.080
 and maybe do some curatorship?

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:41.160
 - No, I want to do 20 more minutes of these,

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.920
 of the UK culture and art figures.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:44.920
 (laughing)

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:45.960
 - Yes, you're right, James.

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.160
 We should wrap this up.

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:49.240
 - Thank you so much for sending your facts in.

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:51.400
 Just a reminder, podcast@QI.com.

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:52.800
 If you'd like to have your facts.

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:54.960
 - Oh, I don't think I did that last week.

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:57.440
 So just to say, but also last week,

00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.400
 if you want to send a fact last week,

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:00.920
 then it's podcast@QI.com.

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:02.280
 - I'll explain to the dearth of facts

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.600
 we've had in the inbox since last week.

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.640
 No, thank you so much for listening to this bit.

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:11.040
 And now let's have some fact custodian award ceremonies.

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:14.040
 (laughing)

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.400
 This is the thing we're doing where,

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:19.120
 if you join Club Fish on Patreon

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:21.400
 at the friend of the podcast tier,

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:23.480
 if you join those exalted heights,

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:26.080
 you get a fact, a headline fact

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.600
 that we've done on the show in the past,

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:30.240
 to be yours, your fact, in perpetuity,

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.320
 forever and ever are meant.

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.440
 It is your fact.

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:37.600
 So we're gonna be dishing out a few of those now

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.720
 to a few friends of the podcast who've joined.

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:40.840
 So let's start with one.

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:42.000
 Anyone want to kick off?

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.440
 - I'll do one. - Lovely.

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:46.760
 - Because this was originally my fact from episode nine.

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.360
 And it is that it was fashionable in New York

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.760
 at the end of the 19th century for women

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:54.560
 to wear a bird of paradise feathers.

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:59.040
 - Hmm. - And that fact is now under the custodianship

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:00.800
 of Drumroll, please.

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:04.400
 David Addis.

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.600
 - Congratulations, David.

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:06.440
 - Well done, David.

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:08.880
 I actually have no memory of that fact whatsoever.

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:09.720
 (laughing)

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:11.360
 - You need to go back and listen to episode nine.

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:12.720
 - I'm gonna, I'm gonna do.

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:15.520
 - This is exciting for all of us to revisit all the episodes.

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:17.520
 - And that was the thing that kicked off bird protection,

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:18.360
 wasn't it?

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:20.000
 As in, people were just wearing these bird feathers

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:20.840
 with it nearly.

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:23.000
 - Is that right? - These birds.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.400
 As many birds of paradise as they used to be,

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:27.120
 a lot of lovely hats being made.

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:27.960
 - Yeah. - Interesting.

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:29.480
 - Yeah. - I think that is what happened.

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:31.320
 It was the odd upon society, wasn't it?

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:33.400
 - I know. - I think hip memory serves.

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.000
 - Yeah. - Don't write 10 if it wasn't.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.760
 There was a thing called the plumage league,

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.080
 which is just a flat out good name for a society.

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:40.160
 - That's your own name, yeah.

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:43.640
 - Very nice. - But yeah, congratulations to you, David.

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:45.240
 - Lovely stuff. Should I read one out?

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:47.320
 - Yeah. - This was my fact from episode nine.

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:50.240
 Alan Cheering lost his buried treasure

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:52.840
 when he couldn't crack his own code.

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:54.000
 I don't know the idea.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.080
 - Yeah. - What a story.

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:58.080
 This is now under the custodianship

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:00.040
 of Martin Hill, congratulations, Martin.

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:03.280
 And this was Alan Cheering in the lead up to World War II,

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:06.640
 worried that all of his valuables were gonna be stolen.

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:09.760
 So I think he traded it in for a couple of silver bars

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:11.160
 or gold bars. - Oh yeah.

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:13.920
 - And he buried them and he made a code

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:16.280
 of where he buried them and he made a code of a code.

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.520
 And then possibly even a code of a code of a code.

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:20.360
 And then after the war. - He loved his codes.

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.560
 - His big on codes. - His one thing

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:25.240
 that we will say about Alan Cheering is he loved the code.

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:26.640
 We love to crack a code.

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:27.960
 And unfortunately in this case,

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.680
 when he went back after the war to crack it,

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:32.200
 the landscape had changed.

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:35.120
 He couldn't quite understand his actual code itself.

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:36.600
 And so he never found it.

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:37.880
 It might still be out there.

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:40.640
 I think the bit of England where he was meant

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:43.560
 to have buried it is now sort of council estate.

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:45.000
 So I think they would have dug it up.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.520
 - Is it there, blackly?

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:47.760
 - I can't remember to be honest, but yeah.

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:48.600
 - I thought it was.

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:50.160
 - If you live anywhere in the Midlands,

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:51.840
 why not dig up your garbage?

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:52.680
 - Absolutely.

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:53.520
 - Yeah.

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:54.600
 - It's good for you anyway.

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:55.960
 - Oh yeah, gardening.

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:56.800
 - There you go.

00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:57.800
 Well, congrats, Martin Hill.

00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:59.080
 - Yeah. - Of course.

00:25:59.080 --> 00:25:59.920
 - Here's one.

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:00.920
 This is going out to Aaron Hung.

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:03.240
 And it's the fact that in 2011,

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:07.760
 the largest sperm bank in the world stopped accepting sperm

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:09.240
 from redheads.

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.880
 - Sorry, Aaron, you got a bit of a--

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:11.800
 - It's a blue one.

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:12.840
 - It's a blue fact.

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:14.400
 There's no doubt about that.

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:17.280
 And I think it was--

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:18.280
 - It was just a canner really.

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:19.120
 - It's an anifact.

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:19.960
 - Yeah.

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.360
 - And the fact of course it was--

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:22.440
 - I think it was a lack of demand.

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:24.480
 I think it was classic anti-redhead prejudice.

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:25.480
 - That is prejudice.

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:26.320
 - Yeah.

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:27.920
 - There's an interesting thing in history.

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:31.080
 I read a paper about this that people have typically thought

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:35.920
 that people with red hair are very sort of sexually active.

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:38.880
 And they've had that reputation throughout history.

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:40.960
 But the research has found out that the reason

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.320
 that they had that reputation is because people just

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:45.000
 generally found them more attractive.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:45.840
 - Oh right.

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.200
 (laughing)

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.640
 - And so they were having more sex,

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:50.160
 but it's just because everyone fancied them.

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.440
 - Yeah, right.

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:53.640
 - Oh, that's not my counter narrative

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:55.520
 to all the anti-gender prejudice.

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:56.360
 - Absolutely.

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:57.360
 - Good.

00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:01.840
 - Wesley Vetter, you are now the proud custodian

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.720
 of this fact.

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:08.080
 The English language has more words borrowed from Hawaiian

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:09.560
 than from Welsh.

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:10.400
 - Really?

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:11.240
 - Yes.

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:12.360
 - Wesley, that one is now yours.

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:14.200
 This was an Andrew Murray original.

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:15.320
 - Yeah.

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:17.480
 And it's, I can't remember any words

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:19.240
 that are borrowed from Hawaiian now.

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:20.240
 - I like it.

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:21.080
 - Wiki.

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:22.080
 - Wiki.

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:23.400
 - Hula.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:24.240
 - Hula.

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:25.080
 - I think Hula hoop.

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:26.720
 - Yeah, Hula dancing.

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:27.560
 - Yes.

00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:30.440
 - But also I think the thing is that in Hawaii,

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:33.640
 they had lots of new plants that needed names.

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:35.280
 And so we took them from Hawaiian.

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:36.120
 - Right.

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:37.640
 - Whereas when we went into Wales,

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.720
 they had the same plants as we had.

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:40.560
 - Right.

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:42.320
 - Which is slightly like maybe leak.

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:43.720
 - No, we already had leaks.

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:44.560
 - Daffs?

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:45.400
 - Daffs, yeah.

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:46.240
 They still existed.

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:50.640
 You know, there was no need to give Welsh names to these things.

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:51.480
 - You're right.

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.600
 And also, let's not forget the Andy Welsh prejudice.

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:54.600
 - Of course.

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:57.160
 - Which, but one interesting thing is that everyone found

00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:58.160
 the Welsh extreme.

00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:59.160
 We attracted.

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:00.160
 - Yes.

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:01.160
 - Oh yeah.

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:02.400
 - Let's do another one.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:05.720
 This we had a guest on in this episode, episode 10.

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.640
 And that guest was Eric Lampair.

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:08.640
 - Eric Lampair.

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:09.640
 - Eric Lampair.

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:10.640
 - I haven't seen him for years.

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:11.640
 - Well, do you know what?

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:12.640
 You can see him currently in a movie.

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:13.640
 - Oh.

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:14.640
 - So there's a new--

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:15.640
 - That's why I haven't seen him

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:16.840
 because that's what they--

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:18.800
 - So there's a movie out at the moment called

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.760
 Grief as the Thingwood Feathers,

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:22.040
 based on a max-ported book.

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:23.520
 And it's Benedict Cumberbatch.

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:26.480
 And there's a big black bird that appears in it.

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:27.320
 - Is he playing the bird?

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:28.320
 - He's inside the bird.

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:29.160
 - Wow.

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:30.000
 - Wow.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.760
 - So you don't see Eric, but he's on Stilts

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:34.400
 and he is the bird in that film.

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.240
 - Very cool.

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:36.080
 - So we grew up.

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:36.920
 - Eric.

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:37.760
 - Yep.

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:38.600
 - What was his fact?

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:41.000
 - His fact was, in 1923,

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.040
 Jockey Frank Hayes won a race in Belmont Park in New York,

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:47.200
 despite being dead.

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:48.040
 - Wow.

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:49.040
 - Yeah, amazing fact.

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:50.360
 That's Emma Goven.

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:51.920
 And congratulations.

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:53.120
 This is now your fact.

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:55.160
 This was, he died on the final leg, Denny.

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:57.680
 I think he had a heart attack while on the horse,

00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:00.240
 but the horse just kept running and won the race.

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.080
 - Right.

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:02.680
 - Yeah. - Gosh, that's amazing.

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:05.040
 - Have we got time for any more Andy or--

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:07.760
 - I think we've got time for three more.

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:08.520
 - Three more, okay.

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:09.560
 Well, I'll do one.

00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:13.120
 This one was a Dan Shriver fight from episode 10.

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:14.680
 I've noticed things are fish.

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:17.880
 And Dan said some buddhist monks run marathons

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:20.240
 to achieve enlightenment.

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:25.240
 And that fact now belongs to Mr. Dan Turner.

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:28.840
 So Dan, congratulations.

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:32.280
 - Yeah, that was one of my favorite earliest facts

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:34.200
 on the podcast, which is this extraordinary thing

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:37.040
 that they run these insanely long marathons

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:38.840
 and the idea is that after,

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:41.000
 however many days of doing it,

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.480
 they would achieve enlightenment.

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:44.000
 So rather than meditating your way to it,

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.360
 you can actually bolt.

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:47.080
 - But the thing is about meditating

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:48.800
 as you can just sit there.

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:49.640
 - Right.

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:50.480
 - Yeah.

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:51.480
 - I think I would prefer to do that method

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:54.760
 of enlightenment than having to get your gym gear on.

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:56.880
 (laughing)

00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:00.000
 - Rub your nipples with Vaseline.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.080
 I mean, I'll be doing that even if I'm just sitting down.

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:04.160
 So that's a wash for me.

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:06.320
 - That's sort of yeah, accidentally achieving enlightenment.

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:07.400
 - Absolutely, yeah.

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:08.720
 - Runners do that, don't they?

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:09.560
 - Yes, they do.

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:10.400
 - Oh, they do, they?

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:11.240
 - Yeah.

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:13.000
 - I thought we'd just getting an insight into your life, Andy.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:13.840
 - Okay.

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:14.680
 (laughing)

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:15.520
 - That's the thing.

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:16.560
 - Otherwise you get jogger's nipple.

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:18.240
 - Yeah, which can be very painful actually.

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:19.440
 - Ooh, it sounds bad.

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:21.040
 I've never run far enough to get jogger's nipple.

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:21.880
 - I've had it.

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:22.720
 - Have you?

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:24.280
 - Did you butter them or?

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:27.200
 - No, I just suffered for the next couple of days.

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:28.040
 - Sensitive.

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:28.880
 - Yeah.

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:30.200
 (laughing)

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:31.520
 - I should move on more facts.

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:33.680
 - All right, let's have a couple more.

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:35.800
 This one goes out to Ben Caligari.

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.120
 Congratulations, Ben.

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:38.800
 Because you're getting an absolute slammer.

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:41.160
 It's that the Slovakian and Slovenian embassies

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:43.000
 in Washington meet once a month

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.400
 to exchange wrongly addressed mail.

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:46.440
 - Brilliant.

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:47.280
 - Yep.

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:48.480
 - Again, an early classic.

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:50.720
 I feel like that was one of the poster facts

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:51.560
 in our early days.

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.640
 - It was Slovakia Slovenia.

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:54.480
 - Yeah.

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:55.640
 - They're not very close.

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:58.160
 They're close in a global sense, but they're not.

00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:59.320
 - Not in a European sense.

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:00.160
 - No.

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.000
 - Yeah, not in a European sense.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:01.840
 They're not very close.

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:03.880
 They're probably close in an embassy sense.

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:04.720
 - Oh yeah.

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:05.560
 - Maybe, maybe.

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:07.600
 - I don't even know if that's a clothe of those embassies.

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:10.120
 (laughing)

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:11.880
 - It's awful when the guy from Afghanistan

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:13.920
 has to go and visit the guy from Zimbabwe.

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:16.440
 (laughing)

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:19.960
 - Yeah, but that's just a great fact.

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:21.200
 - And do we have time for one more?

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.040
 - Yeah.

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:22.880
 - Let's do it.

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:25.560
 This one is going out to Alan Clark.

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:27.000
 In the 18th century,

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.040
 there were genuine medicines called

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:33.840
 Alan's Nippel Linament for those joggers out there.

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.320
 Grymsden's ice enough,

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.840
 Miller's worm plums,

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:40.120
 and Italian buzzing friend.

00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:40.960
 - This was your effect, eh?

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:41.800
 - I remember that.

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:42.640
 I remember that.

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:43.800
 That was a great fact to find.

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:46.120
 I can't remember how I found it now, but yeah.

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:51.120
 Miller's worm plums is such a dodgy sounding.

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:54.400
 It's like they put, Miller is a very nice word,

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:56.280
 like our colleague Ann Miller,

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:58.400
 but worm and plums are two of the worst words

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.040
 you could hear from a doctor.

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:00.880
 (laughing)

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:01.720
 - If you've got,

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.200
 don't the same sentence, you've got plum worms.

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:05.560
 That's really bad.

00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:09.680
 - Yeah, I think it just meant that's the unit of medicine,

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:10.680
 like a lozenge.

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:12.360
 It's just a little plum that you have to take

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:13.480
 to deal with your worms.

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:15.920
 It's almost as if they've surrounded the unpleasant word worm

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:17.320
 with Miller and plums,

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:19.760
 which are, you know, I don't mind a plum.

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:21.600
 I love a plum, actually.

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:22.600
 - Do you?

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:23.440
 - Yes, I cook.

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:24.280
 It doesn't matter.

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:25.800
 We can move on, but I cook.

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:27.560
 - And then I want to hear more.

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:30.400
 - I cook rather than nice plum and oat slice,

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.520
 which I'm sure I've brought into the office for you guys

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:33.640
 in the past.

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:34.480
 No?

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:35.320
 - I don't think so.

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:36.440
 - Next week, next week.

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:39.080
 - Chocolate sausages, the last thing I have from you.

00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:41.080
 - Okay, we can't get back into that.

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:43.200
 - Okay, so tied to finish, Andy.

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.040
 - I think so.

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:46.640
 Thank you so much, everyone, for listening to Little Fish.

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:48.280
 We'll be back in another week with another one

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:51.160
 with more of our facts, with more of your facts.

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:53.240
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us,

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:55.520

 or track us all down on social media.

00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:58.800
 That's it for now, see you next week.

00:32:58.800 --> 00:32:59.640
 Bye.

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:02.220
 (upbeat music)

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:07.220
