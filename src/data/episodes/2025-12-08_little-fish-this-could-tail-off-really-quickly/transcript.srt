00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,900
 - Hello everyone, welcome to this week's episode

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,160
 of Little Fish Before We Start.

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,120
 Andrew Hunter Murray has something he'd like to say to you all,

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,720
 just to keep his inbox from bulging quite so much.

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,520
 - So this is a little, thanks James, hi everybody.

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,120
 This is a little pre-apology and correction.

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,960
 I run a small quiz in the middle of this show

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,920
 about the oldest ever James Bond.

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,280
 I can't wait for you to hear it, it's really fun.

11
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,400
 And in it we say, the two oldest James bonds,

12
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,480
 I won't give away which ones now,

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,640
 but I just like to point out,

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,480
 I do know that Sean Connery was 53

15
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,480
 when he was in, never say never again.

16
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,280
 But it's not a canon Bond film,

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,840
 it's not one of the official ones,

18
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,160
 which is why it's not included in the quiz.

19
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,200
 I woke up sweating, realizing

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,480
 that I had not made this clear in the show itself

21
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,280
 all makes sense soon.

22
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,120
 - Let it never be said that we don't take

23
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,760
 these silly little quizzes, extremely serious thing.

24
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,960
 Seriously, there's a quiz about carrots coming up

25
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,160
 that is honestly the most serious quiz

26
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,320
 I've ever run on this show.

27
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,320
 I'm so excited.

28
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,120
 Too many spoilers ending.

29
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,320
 - Sorry, yes.

30
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,200
 If you would like to get more apologies, corrections,

31
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,280
 and bonus info, why not join Club Fish.

32

 This is our special secret members club.

33
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,800
 We do a four nightly show called Doppers Align

34
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,840
 where you get this kind of sizzling

35
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,720
 behind the scenes hot goss about the show itself.

 Next announcement, before we start this week,

38
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,960
 let me show if you heard our episode,

39
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,720
 which went out a few days ago with none other than Michael Palin,

40
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,240
 then we got a little bit of an extra treat for you.

41
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,240
 We filmed the whole thing and we put it up on YouTube.

42
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,080
 - What?

43
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,640
 - Yeah, I'm sorry James, did you not know?

44
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,480
 - What?

45
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,200
 I was wearing my bikini the whole way through.

46
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,040
 - Yes, I know.

47
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,720
 It did, Michael did comment when you were out of the room.

48
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,480
 He said, "What a friendly young lady that is."

49
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,480
 (laughing)

50
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,400
 Yeah, so we filmed the whole thing.

51
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,520
 It's on YouTube.

52
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,520
 You can see us, like, worshipping Michael Palin in real time.

53
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,160
 It's great, it's great fun.

54
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,360
 - Just go on to YouTube and search for our names

55
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,280
 or search for.

56
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,280
 - No such thing as a fish.

57
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,160
 - No such thing as a fish and I'm sure you'll find it.

58
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,360
 - But for now, enjoy this little fish.

59
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,560
 On with the podcast.

60
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,160
 (upbeat music)

61
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,680
 (waves crashing)

62
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,280
 (upbeat music)

63
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:31,280
 - Hello and welcome to Little Fish.

64
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,240
 This is our new weekly show where we read out your facts.

65
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,720
 We've had enough of our facts.

66
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,560
 Let's have some of yours.

67
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,520
 You've been sending them in to podcast@QI.com

68
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,280
 and they are terrific.

69
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,400
 And so we're gonna share some of the absolute cremd

70
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,000
 that I crem with you now.

71
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,840
 Who's got a fact?

72
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,680
 Who would like to kick off?

73
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,600
 - I'm here, I'm here with Dan Shriver in James Harkin.

74
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,440
 - Hey Andy.

75
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,280
 - My name's Andrew Hunter Murray.

76
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,120
 Do I say all that?

77
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,040
 - I don't think I said that last week.

78
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,880
 - Well.

79
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,600
 - Last week I was here with Andrew Hunter Murray

80
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,480
 and Dan Shriver.

81
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,320
 (laughing)

82
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,720
 - Great.

83
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,480
 - And in case I forget to say it, next week,

84
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,920
 I will be with Andrew Hunter Murray in James Harkin.

85
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,080
 - A great stroller gives a fact.

86
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,600
 - All right, Gabe Bollard said, big fan of the show,

87
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,800
 I saw Dan post on Instagram that he found the book

88
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,760
 claiming to feature posthumous interviews

89
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,200
 with Elvis Presley's ghost.

90
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,240
 How this is true is written by Hans Holzer,

91
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,400
 who is the person who sort of defined what a ghost hunter was

92
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,600
 and very much inspired Dan Acroid

93
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,480
 for ghost busters and so on.

94
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,280
 He's added a fact that has nothing to do with that.

95
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,520
 Says in the early 90s, when the United States Postal Service

96
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,760
 proposed issuing an Elvis Presley stamp,

97
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,080
 there was an effort to block it

98
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,200
 because someone must be dead in order to appear

99
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,200
 on a US postage stamp.

100
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,880
 And Elvis, they said, was still alive.

101
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,520
 (laughing)

102
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,360
 - That's wonderful.

103
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,360
 - That's really good.

104
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,200
 - That's nice.

105
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,200
 - That is very funny.

106
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,040
 That is a thing, isn't it?

107
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,320
 You have to be dead in order to be on a stamp.

108
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,880
 - Definitely used to be the case.

109
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,720
 - Yeah.

110
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,560
 - I'm not sure it still is.

111
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,880
 - So Neil Armstrong landing on the moon was okay

112
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,360
 because you couldn't see his face.

113
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,560
 So it was a generic astronaut even though it was--

114
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,720
 - Such nonsense.

115
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,560
 - Yeah.

116
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,480
 - Clearly, just we're proud we put someone on the moon

117
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,440
 so we're gonna break the stamp rule.

118
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,280
 - Yeah.

119
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,120
 - So what that is?

120
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,960
 Like, well, they were saying,

121
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,440
 oh, it's an astronaut rather than Neil Armstrong.

122
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,280
 - Yes.

123
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,560
 - Well, what's the next astronaut's name?

124
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,360
 - Do you remember as well that that led to Buzz Aldrin's dad

125
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:20,080
 standing outside the White House with a placard

126
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,800
 that read, "My son stood on there too."

127
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,680
 - And it was him being furious there.

128
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,880
 - Michael Collins' mum was there saying,

129
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,760
 Michael didn't actually stand on the moon,

130
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,480
 but he was just dead at a car driving around the ring

131
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,240
 around the White House.

132
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,320
 (laughing)

133
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,400
 - Yeah, I think as well that one person in the UK

134
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,480
 did sneak onto a stamp accidentally who was still alive

135
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,880
 and that's Roger Taylor from Queen

136
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,280
 'cause they did a Freddie Mercury stamp

137
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,880
 but in the background, Taylor's drumming.

138
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,920
 And so technically they have put someone--

139
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,440
 - But you are allowed the Queen on stamps.

140
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,280
 - Compulsory.

141
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,400
 - So a member of Queen feels fair as well.

142
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,240
 - Yeah, brilliant.

143
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,080
 - There we go.

144
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,080
 - Are you sure you're allowed?

145
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:01,920
 Are you not?

146
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,920
 There's the rule the same in the UK

147
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,920
 that you can't be honest about unless you do.

148
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,160
 - Again, I think it used to be.

149
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,760
 I'm not sure if it still is now,

150
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,040
 but definitely used to be.

151
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,560
 - We've lost so many of our traditions.

152
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,560
 - Here is a fact.

153
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,280
 - So this is from Chris Bemis.

154
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,120
 And Chris Bemis says,

155
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,760
 "My fact is the largest shopping mall in the US,

156
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,120
 "Mall of America is kept warm in winter by human body heat."

157
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,360
 - Oh, so is that the humans who are shopping in the mall

158
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,440
 or is it a separate candle of trained humans

159
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,520
 who just go around being hot?

160
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,800
 - Do you remember in the last episode

161
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,520
 we said that you have very high body heat

162
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,880
 and so your watch runs faster than most people?

163
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,720
 - Yeah.

164
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,640
 - They've people, a lot of people like you in the basement.

165
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,920
 No, this is just people who are shopping.

166
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,000
 And actually, like I saw a Reddit on this

167
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,440
 and they say that really the amount of heat

168
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,840
 that's given off by the human bodies

169
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,320
 is really, really negligible.

170
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,200
 And while it does say on the website

171
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,480
 that the mall has no central heating

172
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,040
 and that it uses the body heat,

173
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,920
 they're quite cagey with what they actually say

174
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,120
 and probably all the individual stores

175
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,520
 have their own heating systems.

176
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,160
 - We also have a huge coal fire burning in the centre.

177
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,360
 So we don't have central heating, but we...

178
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,360
 So I think it's like, it's definitely claimed by the mall

179
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,960
 but whether it's 100% true, I'm not absolutely certain.

180
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,600
 And also they have all these sky lights

181
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,480
 that this sunlight belongs out as well.

182
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,240
 But here's a question for you.

183
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,840
 Do you know in a few recent podcasts,

184
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,360
 I've been saying, I'll ask you a question

185
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,640
 and if you get the answer right,

186
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,480
 you'll get a million quid or 10 million quid.

187
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,320
 - Yes.

188
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,000
 - Well, I'm gonna do another one of those,

189
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,640
 but I'm a bit wary that eventually

190
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,040
 you will get one of these right.

191
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,160
 But for now, I'll give you 100 million quid.

192
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,440
 - If you can tell me which country

193
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,520
 the world's largest mall is according to Wikipedia.

194
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,200
 - Okay.

195
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,240
 - Eritrea.

196
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,080
 - No.

197
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,920
 - Mexico.

198
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,080
 - No, unlucky lads.

199
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,920
 (laughing)

200
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,720
 - That goes into the pot for the next episode.

201
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,600
 It's the Iran Mall in Tehran.

202
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,080
 - Oh, no, no.

203
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,560
 - The largest mall in the world.

204
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,800
 - That's pretty good, is it?

205
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,640
 - Just very...

206
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,920
 - It's just bass, got hotels, it's got lots of,

207
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,680
 it's just got all sorts of stuff in there.

208
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,520
 - Big mall.

209
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,360
 - Big mall.

210
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,200
 - Big or mall.

211
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,200
 - Nice.

212
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,040
 - I've got another fact.

213
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,880
 - Go for it.

214
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,720
 - Yeah.

215
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,640
 - From Susanna Pate of British Carrots.

216
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,680
 - Okay.

217
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,200
 - This came in a little while ago.

218
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,960
 - Sorry, you say plate of carrots.

219
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,240
 - Sorry.

220
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,080
 - Pate.

221
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,920
 - Oh.

222
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,120
 - Of British Carrots.

223
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,960
 - Oh.

224
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,800
 - Okay.

225
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,280
 - Her name is Susanna Pate, and she works for,

226
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,160
 I don't need to tell you guys who British Carrots are,

227
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,760
 but they're just, you know, for the international list.

228
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,880
 - They're a trade body, whose main job is to get us all

229
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,080
 eating more carrots.

230
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,560
 - Right.

231
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,920
 - It's a hugely powerful organization.

232
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,080
 Shadowey, I would say.

233
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,640
 - Yeah.

234
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,800
 - And she wrote because British Carrot Day was coming up.

235
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,640
 - Okay.

236
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,520
 - I was on the 3rd of October.

237
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,920
 So we have missed it by quite some way.

238
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,120
 But I just, I didn't want to leave, leave her out.

239
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,960
 - Because...

240
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,800
 - Because of that.

241
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,640
 - Yeah, because of us.

242
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,560
 - You know, I love a carrot.

243
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,400
 - Absolutely.

244
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,000
 - Is it strange that, well, that national carrot day is

245
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,480
 in October, when presumably all the carrots have been

246
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,800
 well found by then?

247
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,400
 - James, I'd like to refer you to Susanna's email.

248
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,240
 - Okay.

249
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,680
 - Carrots are harvested 12 months of the year in the UK.

250
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,080
 - Give me a break.

251
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,960
 - So they, so they're one of the freshest and most versatile

252
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,040
 vegetables we can all enjoy.

253
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,040
 That's according to Harry Strausson,

254
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,960
 who I presume grows carrots.

255
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,640
 Anyway, I thought a couple of just little quiz questions

256
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,800
 based off her facts.

257
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,640
 - Yeah.

258
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,320
 - How many carrot seeds are sewn in Britain each year?

259
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,040
 - Um, each carrot seeds.

260
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,600
 - Oh, each carrot seeds each year.

261
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:40,480
 If I get within 10 billion of this, I'll be astonished.

262
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,320
 - Okay, okay.

263
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,040
 - I'm gonna say 50 billion.

264
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,880
 Okay.

265
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,040
 - Oh, I'm glad you're that high, because I was going high.

266
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,440
 I was gonna say 200 billion.

267
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,880
 - Well, it's 22 billion.

268
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,480
 So down is that by a factor of 10.

269
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,320
 - James got reasonably close to you.

270
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,320
 - I mean, that didn't get close in the grand scheme of things.

271
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,720
 - No, if they did plant 50 billion,

272
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,360
 we'd have an insane over capacity of carrots.

273
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,600
 - That's not a world I want 11.

274
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,520
 Walk along the street just waiting through carrots

275
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,600
 as you go to the office every day.

276
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,440
 - All right.

277
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,200
 - What is the total tonnage of carrots

278
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,840
 that those 22 billion seeds between them produce?

279
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,560
 So how many tons of carrots we're talking?

280
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,600
 22 billion seeds, how many tons of carrots?

281
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,040
 - Oh, I hate this quiz.

282
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,520
 - It's fat quiz.

283
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,200
 - I watched Richard Alston's House of Games

284
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,320
 for the first ever time this week.

285
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,800
 No offense, I'd be because you were on it,

286
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,240
 and I didn't watch it where you were on it.

287
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,080
 - Oh, I don't want it, don't worry.

288
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,080
 - But they do this stuff, don't they?

289
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,080
 Where you have to just make a random guess on things.

290
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,600
 - Yeah, this is worse than House of Games.

291
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,600
 I'm not afraid to admit that.

292
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,440
 - Okay.

293
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,600
 - All right, I'll go first, you go on first, last time.

294
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,920
 - Okay.

295
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,120
 - Six.

296
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,760
 - Come on, play the game, mate.

297
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,280
 - I ain't gonna go 100 billion.

298
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,360
 - 100 billion.

299
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,560
 - You think that every carrot seed

300
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,640
 produces five tons of carrots?

301
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:54,360
 - This is why you got invited down House of Games,

302
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,760
 and I did it.

303
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,280
 Yeah, that's a good pipe.

304
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,640
 - But this is good because now we're tied.

305
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,840
 - Yeah, you're right.

306
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,840
 I'm ready to bet you both that.

307
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,720
 Well, I'll guess 700,000 tons,

308
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,240
 which is the correct answer.

309
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,400
 - Oh, well done.

310
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,320
 - And just out of interest,

311
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,240
 that would stretch 1.4 million miles

312
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,920
 if you put the carrots end to end.

313
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,040
 - Great.

314
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,880
 - Okay, carry on.

315
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,720
 Next fact.

316
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,560
 - Thank you, Ms. Plate.

317
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,400
 - Paid.

318
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,960
 - Only two questions in this quiz.

319
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,040
 - Okay, one last question, what?

320
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,480
 - 1.9 million miles.

321
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,520
 - Percentage.

322
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,080
 - Of the carrots consumers by in the UK

323
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,200
 are grown in Britain.

324
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,040
 - 38.

325
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,640
 - You think, okay, 38.

326
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,800
 We're only 38% self-sufficient in carrots.

327
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,640
 - Ah, interesting.

328
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,880
 You said the word only there.

329
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,720
 Right, 9.

330
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,040
 - Oh, James wins.

331
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,360
 It's 97.

332
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,200
 - That's good.

333
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,040
 - I know.

334
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,760
 So there's almost no need to buy imported carrots.

335
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,600
 Almost.

336
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,680
 So that's thank you, Susanna.

337
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,520
 - Very good.

338
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,040
 - And if you work for like the wallboard

339
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,720
 or whatever podcast at qi.com.

340
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,840
 The cheese bar, they're always doing stuff, aren't they?

341
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,680
 - Yeah, brilliant.

342
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,840
 - And we'll forward this app to Richard Osmond.

343
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,000
 You should have a new job.

344
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,560
 - Very same.

345
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,960
 Tony Shane writes about a bond.

346
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,200
 So a financial bond.

347
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,040
 - Yeah.

348
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,760
 - You buy a bond and it pays out a certain rate of interest

349
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,080
 for a certain number of years, right?

350
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,000
 And then when the bond returns,

351
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,720
 you get all the original money you put in back.

352
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,560
 - Yeah.

353
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,400
 - So I pay 100 quid.

354
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,520
 I get three quid a year for 10 years

355
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,640
 and then I get 100 quid back.

356
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,560
 Pretty good deal.

357
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,640
 And it's if companies or governments

358
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,800
 need to raise a lot of money initially

359
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,000
 and fund something.

360
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,160
 - A war first time.

361
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,000
 - A war.

362
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,840
 - A war.

363
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,680
 - Well.

364
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,880
 - There is a bond which was issued in 1648,

365
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,040
 which is still paying out.

366
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,480
 (laughing)

367
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,800
 - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

368
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,080
 - It was issued in the Netherlands, 377 years ago.

369
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,600
 Charles I was still alive in England.

370
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,360
 And it was the water authority.

371
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,960
 They issued a bond and it's still paying.

372
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,160
 - But you said, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

373
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,000
 Like you knew this.

374
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,760
 - I feel like we may have covered

375
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,600
 this.

376
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,440
 - Oh really?

377
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,280
 - A long time ago on a show.

378
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,120
 - I'm not familiar with it.

379
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,960
 - It's just stunning.

380
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,080
 So the actual original bond is in Yale now.

381
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,080
 It's passed through many hands over the centuries.

382
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,840
 It's written on ghost kin.

383
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,680
 - Oh wow.

384
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,440
 - And it's so old.

385
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,640
 And the number of water boards in the Netherlands

386
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,720
 just needed to raise money for something.

387
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,280
 And this isn't even the oldest bond in the world

388
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,240
 that's still active.

389
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,280
 There is one that was issued in 1624.

390
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,960
 It had its 400th birthday last year.

391
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,760
 It is still paying out.

392
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,040
 And it was again, Dutch water utility.

393
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,520
 They had this disaster where some drifting ice broke

394
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,920
 through a dike, huge problem in the Netherlands

395
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,560
 because it's all underwater.

396
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,640
 They needed to raise money.

397
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,080
 And this one pays about 13 euros still every year

398
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,680
 that you're the bond holder.

399
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,080
 - It's just so cool.

400
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,920
 - Yeah.

401
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,480
 - I think I should set one up so people can send me money

402
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,560
 and I can become a spy or something.

403
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,680
 - Wait, are you issuing the bond?

404
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,120
 - Yeah, yeah, you'll be called the James Bond.

405
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,960
 - Oh my god.

406
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,000
 - It was a funny God.

407
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,600
 - I gave you a second to notice

408
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,960
 that you're walking into.

409
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,200
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

410
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,040
 - All right.

411
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,960
 Well, I actually did prepare a separate little quiz.

412
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,800
 Who was the oldest bond?

413
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,640
 - Oh.

414
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,480
 - As in James Bond.

415
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,200
 - James Bond, James Bond.

416
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,400
 The oldest actor to play James Bond.

417
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,400
 - Not Jamal.

418
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,720
 - Correct.

419
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,640
 Second oldest.

420
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,800
 - Daniel Craig.

421
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,840
 - Daniel Craig, correct.

422
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,680
 Carry on.

423
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,840
 (laughing)

424
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,040
 - Why is this quiz?

425
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,920
 - I'd sometimes, they're not all in parties.

426
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,280
 It's not all like how many carrot seeds are there

427
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,960
 in the UK every year.

428
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,760
 Sometimes it's just a little confidence builder.

429
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,680
 So Roger Moore was 57 when he hung up his false teeth

430
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,320
 and wagon all of that.

431
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,800
 And, but Daniel Craig was 51 when he stopped doing it.

432
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,120
 - Yeah.

433
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,120
 - In that last bond first.

434
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,120
 - Not massively surprised.

435
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,160
 What about our lays and beef of number three?

436
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,520
 - I haven't written down any other.

437
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,360
 - Oh.

438
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,360
 - Tonery?

439
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,640
 - I haven't written down any other names and ages.

440
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,920
 Should have done.

441
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,000
 - You probably didn't think we were going to get the first two

442
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,040
 so quickly, I guess.

443
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,760
 - I could have said I didn't.

444
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,920
 - But, lays and beef, George lays and beef.

445
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,920
 I, someone painted my old flat years and years ago

446
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,360
 who had come, he'd, did I talk to his poor?

447
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,200
 - No.

448
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,160
 - Andy, this would be the best anecdote you've ever told us.

449
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,720
 Shall we remember it?

450
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,840
 (laughing)

451
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,680
 - Wait, wait, wait.

452
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,240
 This could tail off really quickly.

453
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,240
 (laughing)

454
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,480
 - Layson B's dead now, isn't he?

455
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,320
 He's dead.

456
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,680
 - I don't think he is.

457
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,120
 - I better not say it like that.

458
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,160
 (laughing)

459
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,120
 - Okay, let me see, let me see.

460
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,240
 - Melissa, imagine this anecdote, begins,

461
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,520
 a friend of mine was painting a flat,

462
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,160
 and ends with something just libelous against George,

463
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,840
 I didn't mean it.

464
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,360
 - He's very much going strong.

465
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,200
 - Let's move on.

466
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,040
 - Yeah.

467
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,360
 - I told you, I was going to tail off.

468
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,960
 I told you, we trusted you.

469
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,200
 He had such a front loaded it so well.

470
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,200
 He supposedly got the gig of bond

471
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,200
 when he was having his hair done.

472
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,880
 This is one of the stories that gets told.

473
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,760
 And one of the broccoli's was sitting next to him.

474
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,280
 - Big broccoli.

475
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,120
 - We're sitting next to him.

476
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,960
 - It can be broccoli, the producer.

477
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,960
 - Gaby broccoli, Barbara.

478
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,360
 - Or Barbara, it could have been Barbara.

479
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,200
 - Yeah.

480
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,120
 - And Layson, he shot him six times through the head, didn't he?

481
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,960
 - Yes.

482
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,800
 - So you've got what it takes, kid.

483
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,800
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

484
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,240
 - He's also, do you remember that there was going to be

485
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,080
 a bond of a very different nature,

486
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,880
 a different kind of character, not strictly an actor?

487
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,680
 And he wasn't allowed to be bond in the end

488
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,680
 because his face looked a bit too much like a farmer's.

489
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,800
 (laughing)

490
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,240
 - We've spoken about this on the podcast.

491
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,440
 It might have been a part of an edit.

492
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,680
 - Someone's a bright blessed?

493
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,520
 - No.

494
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,280
 - You look too much like a farmer.

495
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,480
 Who looks like a farmer?

496
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,240
 - Interestingly, a book of theirs is right behind me,

497
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,040
 but you're sitting in front of 500 books.

498
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,040
 - Wait a minute, I know, I'm Miller.

499
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,720
 (laughing)

500
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,960
 - It is Randall Finds.

501
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,800
 - Oh yeah.

502
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,160
 - Remember Randall Finds went to auditions

503
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,000
 and was-- - He was in the running.

504
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,840
 - Yeah.

505
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,400
 - I think it was either his hands look like a farmer

506
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,040
 or his face, one of the two.

507
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,620
 (upbeat music)

508
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:53,880
 - I've got one, Andrew Price.

509
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,120
 I'm a long-term listener living in North Carolina, USA,

510
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,600
 where I work as a nurse.

511
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,520
 I'm sending you an article I found in the New York Times

512
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,440
 about a type of seabird, the Streaked Shearwater,

513
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,200
 and the article is headlined, "These majestic seabirds

514
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,520
 never stop pooping."

515
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,280
 And basically, scientists did an experiment

516
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,280
 on the Streaked Shearwater where they put cameras

517
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,840
 on the bottoms of the birds pointing backwards.

518
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,160
 And I think they were trying to work out

519
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,800
 something about their flight or their flight dynamics

520
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,720
 or something.

521
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,040
 But basically, what they found is,

522
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,840
 are these birds are constantly powing?

523
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,640
 It's extraordinary.

524
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,560
 It's 5% of their mass every hour.

525
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,400
 - Whoa.

526
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,560
 - I know.

527
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,200
 And Andrew writes, "To put this into perspective,

528
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,200
 this would be like me pooping out an 11 pound poop."

529
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,520
 I don't like that word, poop.

530
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,360
 Every hour about the same weight as a normal house cat.

531
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,640
 (laughing)

532
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:51,720
 Or 132 pounds, the weight of two Dalmatians

533
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,080
 in the course of a 12 hour work day.

534
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,920
 - Wow.

535
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,160
 (laughing)

536
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,120
 - 50 and a half days, and you have 101 Dalmatians.

537
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,720
 (laughing)

538
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,560
 - That's amazing.

539
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,240
 - That's very upsetting.

540
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,480
 What a bird.

541
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,320
 - What a bird.

542
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,480
 What a bird.

543
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,480
 (laughing)

544
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,720
 - Like you, Andrew, great fact.

545
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,720
 - Yeah, that's brilliant.

546
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,560
 - Well, Ma'am.

547
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,240
 - Yeah, I got actually another poo one to read out here.

548
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,800
 This was sent in by Liz May.

549
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,720
 And she says that this is an article she spotted.

550
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,320
 A woman in Australia has now been

551
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,680
 in a year's long remission from severe bipolar disorder

552
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,560
 after receiving homemade fecal transplant

553
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,520
 animals from her husband.

554
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,680
 - Oh, boy.

555
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,560
 - Her case is one of the first in the world.

556
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,920
 It may lead to improved treatments

557
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,960
 for bipolar disorder.

558
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,960
 - I don't think it will.

559
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,200
 (laughing)

560
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,640
 - So sorry, homemade, I don't even know how you would,

561
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,000
 how you would think of home making

562
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,440
 a fecal transplant animal.

563
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,440
 - Yeah.

564
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,280
 - Yeah.

565
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,120
 - Do you know what I mean?

566
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,320
 It just wouldn't occur to me to, to do.

567
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,320
 - No, which bit.

568
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,520
 - Home making, I suppose.

569
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,120
 - Like if I went to the doctor and he said,

570
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:00,040
 look, it sounds crazy, but actually we think your microbiome

571
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,200
 might be maladjusted and we think maybe we can get it

572
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,240
 back into an equilibrium by doing this procedure.

573
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,280
 But I don't think they would then say,

574
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,560
 can you just go home and ask your,

575
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,000
 but would you rather have someone else's poo up there

576
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,720
 or would you rather have someone you know?

577
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,000
 - Or would you think someone else's?

578
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,840
 - Oh, really?

579
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,920
 - Yes, because I think.

580
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,240
 - Yeah, but that's because I have to keep,

581
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,040
 if it's someone close to you, like a partner,

582
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,360
 you have to look at them, I think it would,

583
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,720
 I think it takes a little of the spark out of a marriage.

584
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,240
 (laughing)

585
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,400
 - I'm wondering the circumstances in which you raise

586
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,480
 your idea, you know.

587
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,960
 - Oh, you've got to build up to it.

588
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,000
 That's baby steps.

589
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 - You can't just go straight in and say,

590
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,320
 I think we should do this.

591
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,400
 - You've got to be like.

592
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,720
 - I wonder, I heard the Jones is at number 14

593
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,440
 and doing quite an interesting thing.

594
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,400
 I don't say we should do it.

595
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,840
 I just, I just, you know,

596
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,000
 it's something that kind of interests me a little bit.

597
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 - Yeah, yeah.

598
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,760
 - I guess we could try it.

599
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,120
 - We could try it.

600
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,520
 - For your birthday, maybe.

601
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:05,880
 - Great fact.

602
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,000
 - Well, great that it worked as well.

603
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,280
 - Yeah. - Around the coats.

604
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,800
 - Rites, according to the Rale Shakespeare Company,

605
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,080
 50% of the world's children study Shakespeare.

606
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:14,920
 - Wow.

607
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,920
 - That's nice, isn't it?

608
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,320
 - That's great.

609
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,160
 - I got to say.

610
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,000
 - It's good for Britain,

611
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,120
 because it gives us soft power around the world.

612
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,040
 - And all the plays are bloody good.

613
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,480
 - They are, they're really good.

614
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,400
 Shakespeare's one of those writers,

615
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,360
 whoever wants to, he's good.

616
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,520
 And then you read him and actually he's really good.

617
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,360
 - I'll leave you a tell.

618
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,040
 - Tell us more about the Shakespeare part.

619
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,520
 (laughing)

620
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,360
 - Give us more of that.

621
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,200
 - Well.

622
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,200
 (laughing)

623
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:41,200
 The guy who decorated my hat had a really interesting story

624
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,940
 about Bill Beckton.

625
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,180
 - He is dead, I can say that much.

626
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,640
 - Oh, well he said he was a wanker.

627
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,240
 (laughing)

628
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,920
 - So this was a study done in 2014.

629
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,280
 Okay, and it also named Shakespeare

630
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,760
 as the most popular person associated with UK art

631
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,760
 and culture in the world.

632
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:02,560
 Can you name any other people who are on that list?

633
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,040
 And I have a list of 13 other people.

634
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:05,880
 - Charles Dickens.

635
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,720
 - No.

636
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,680
 - These are just any kind, any feel.

637
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,640
 - Anyone in the world associates them

638
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,320
 with UK art and culture.

639
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,160
 - George Orwell.

640
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:13,980
 - No.

641
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,060
 - John Lennon.

642
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:15,900
 - The Beatles.

643
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,120
 - The Beatles, I'll give you.

644
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,960
 - Oh, Jane Austen?

645
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,800
 - No.

646
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,800
 - Oh my god.

647
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,360
 - That's way more likely to get these.

648
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,200
 - Okay.

649
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,040
 - David Bowie.

650
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,960
 - No, for good guess.

651
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,000
 - Edmund Hillary.

652
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,840
 - No.

653
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,680
 - Brian Blessed.

654
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,920
 - Edmund Hillary is from New Zealand.

655
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,760
 - Oh yeah.

656
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,080
 (laughing)

657
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,400
 - Okay, Dan's way more likely to get this.

658
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,480
 - So we're thinking of John Plees.

659
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,600
 - John Plees now.

660
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,680
 - Freddie Mercury.

661
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,520
 - No.

662
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,480
 God, I genuinely thought you'd get a few more of these.

663
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,320
 - The Queen.

664
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,320
 - The Queen, yeah.

665
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,160
 - Yeah.

666
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,000
 - Queen.

667
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,840
 - You kicked culture.

668
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,680
 - Well culture.

669
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,000
 - You're all so racing.

670
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,840
 - I'm sorry to be a snobby,

671
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,000
 but she just didn't, do you mean the old queen?

672
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 - Queen Elizabeth II.

673
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,600
 - Yeah, the true queen.

674
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,920
 - Yeah, yeah, go on.

675
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,480
 Okay, so we had the Queen.

676
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,800
 We had Shakespeare.

677
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,760
 - And we've had the Beatles.

678
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,160
 - I'm telling you, I'll give you McCartney as well,

679
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,640
 'cause you said the Beatles.

680
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,480
 - Twiggy.

681
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,320
 - No.

682
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,160
 - Twiggy.

683
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,000
 - Sting.

684
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,840
 - 2014.

685
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,080
 - No, such thing as a fish.

686
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,080
 (laughing)

687
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,480
 - They've got anaticity, so I'll give you that.

688
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,320
 No, not that.

689
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,680
 - 2014, that's a clue, 2014.

690
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,840
 - It's true.

691
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,680
 - Similar on the way out.

692
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,520
 - No.

693
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,520
 - Dapper laughs.

694
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,800
 - More famous than Lily Allen for sure.

695
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,640
 - Endobs.

696
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,480
 - Endobs.

697
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,320
 - Vernon Manning.

698
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,800
 (laughing)

699
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,960
 - And Dale is what I was saying before there.

700
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,800
 - Dale.

701
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,640
 - And Dale.

702
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,640
 - And author.

703
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,720
 - And author.

704
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,560
 - Philip Pullman.

705
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,400
 - Terry Pratchard.

706
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,000
 - Come on guys, the most famous British author.

707
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,840
 - JK Rowling.

708
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,680
 - Yes.

709
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,120
 - A soccer player?

710
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:42,960
 - Beckham.

711
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,800
 - Correct.

712
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,640
 - Really?

713
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,680
 - An actor.

714
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,680
 - Alan Rickman.

715
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,520
 - No.

716
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,360
 - Ray phones.

717
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,200
 - No.

718
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,200
 - Simon Callow.

719
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,200
 (laughing)

720
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,200
 - Benedict Cumberbatch.

721
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,200
 - Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

722
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,480
 - And a puppet dog that sells car insurance.

723
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,320
 - Churchill?

724
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,160
 - Churchill.

725
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,000
 - Churchill, it just says Churchill.

726
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,840
 I assume it's that.

727
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,360
 (laughing)

728
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,360
 Good quiz, guys.

729
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,200
 - It's pretty good.

730
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,040
 - Well done.

731
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,040
 - Wow, really good quiz.

732
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,400
 - I'm gonna call the Churchill, make it onto the dog.

733
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,320
 - The dog over the politics.

734
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,200
 - It will be Winston Churchill, I'm sure.

735
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,040
 - I wish.

736
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,360
 - It's just always, I was just doing a funny.

737
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,360
 - Let's go compare mere cats, play on that.

738
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,280
 - Anyway, John is next week, but.

739
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,520
 (laughing)

740
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,160
 John is next week for my quiz, Pollock Teap.

741
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,000
 (laughing)

742
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,360
 On the on channel five.

743
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,200
 - Oh.

744
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,240
 - Okay, well, I think we, oh, it's not,

745
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,520
 I'm not even hosting this, am I?

746
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,640
 - You are hosting this one.

747
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,480
 - Andy.

748
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,400
 - With me, yeah.

749
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,240
 - Yeah.

750
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,760
 - Don't you think we should maybe end

751
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,080
 and maybe do some curatorship?

752
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,160
 - No, I want to do 20 more minutes of these,

753
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,920
 of the UK culture and art figures.

754
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,920
 (laughing)

755
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,960
 - Yes, you're right, James.

756
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,160
 We should wrap this up.

757
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,240
 - Thank you so much for sending your facts in.

758
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,400
 Just a reminder, podcast@QI.com.

759
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,800
 If you'd like to have your facts.

760
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,960
 - Oh, I don't think I did that last week.

761
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,440
 So just to say, but also last week,

762
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,400
 if you want to send a fact last week,

763
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,920
 then it's podcast@QI.com.

764
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,280
 - I'll explain to the dearth of facts

765
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,600
 we've had in the inbox since last week.

766
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,640
 No, thank you so much for listening to this bit.

767
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,040
 And now let's have some fact custodian award ceremonies.

768
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,040
 (laughing)

769
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,400
 This is the thing we're doing where,

770
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,120
 if you join Club Fish on Patreon

771
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,400
 at the friend of the podcast tier,

772
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,480
 if you join those exalted heights,

773
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,080
 you get a fact, a headline fact

774
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,600
 that we've done on the show in the past,

775
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,240
 to be yours, your fact, in perpetuity,

776
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,320
 forever and ever are meant.

777
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,440
 It is your fact.

778
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,600
 So we're gonna be dishing out a few of those now

779
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,720
 to a few friends of the podcast who've joined.

780
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,840
 So let's start with one.

781
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,000
 Anyone want to kick off?

782
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,440
 - I'll do one. - Lovely.

783
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,760
 - Because this was originally my fact from episode nine.

784
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,360
 And it is that it was fashionable in New York

785
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,760
 at the end of the 19th century for women

786
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,560
 to wear a bird of paradise feathers.

787
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:59,040
 - Hmm. - And that fact is now under the custodianship

788
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,800
 of Drumroll, please.

789
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,400
 David Addis.

790
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,600
 - Congratulations, David.

791
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,440
 - Well done, David.

792
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,880
 I actually have no memory of that fact whatsoever.

793
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,720
 (laughing)

794
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,360
 - You need to go back and listen to episode nine.

795
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,720
 - I'm gonna, I'm gonna do.

796
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,520
 - This is exciting for all of us to revisit all the episodes.

797
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,520
 - And that was the thing that kicked off bird protection,

798
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,360
 wasn't it?

799
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,000
 As in, people were just wearing these bird feathers

800
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,840
 with it nearly.

801
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,000
 - Is that right? - These birds.

802
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,400
 As many birds of paradise as they used to be,

803
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,120
 a lot of lovely hats being made.

804
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:27,960
 - Yeah. - Interesting.

805
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,480
 - Yeah. - I think that is what happened.

806
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,320
 It was the odd upon society, wasn't it?

807
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,400
 - I know. - I think hip memory serves.

808
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,000
 - Yeah. - Don't write 10 if it wasn't.

809
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,760
 There was a thing called the plumage league,

810
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,080
 which is just a flat out good name for a society.

811
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,160
 - That's your own name, yeah.

812
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,640
 - Very nice. - But yeah, congratulations to you, David.

813
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,240
 - Lovely stuff. Should I read one out?

814
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,320
 - Yeah. - This was my fact from episode nine.

815
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,240
 Alan Cheering lost his buried treasure

816
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,840
 when he couldn't crack his own code.

817
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,000
 I don't know the idea.

818
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,080
 - Yeah. - What a story.

819
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,080
 This is now under the custodianship

820
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,040
 of Martin Hill, congratulations, Martin.

821
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,280
 And this was Alan Cheering in the lead up to World War II,

822
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:06,640
 worried that all of his valuables were gonna be stolen.

823
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,760
 So I think he traded it in for a couple of silver bars

824
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,160
 or gold bars. - Oh yeah.

825
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,920
 - And he buried them and he made a code

826
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,280
 of where he buried them and he made a code of a code.

827
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,520
 And then possibly even a code of a code of a code.

828
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,360
 And then after the war. - He loved his codes.

829
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,560
 - His big on codes. - His one thing

830
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,240
 that we will say about Alan Cheering is he loved the code.

831
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,640
 We love to crack a code.

832
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,960
 And unfortunately in this case,

833
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,680
 when he went back after the war to crack it,

834
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,200
 the landscape had changed.

835
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,120
 He couldn't quite understand his actual code itself.

836
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,600
 And so he never found it.

837
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,880
 It might still be out there.

838
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,640
 I think the bit of England where he was meant

839
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,560
 to have buried it is now sort of council estate.

840
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,000
 So I think they would have dug it up.

841
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,520
 - Is it there, blackly?

842
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,760
 - I can't remember to be honest, but yeah.

843
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,600
 - I thought it was.

844
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,160
 - If you live anywhere in the Midlands,

845
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,840
 why not dig up your garbage?

846
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,680
 - Absolutely.

847
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,520
 - Yeah.

848
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,600
 - It's good for you anyway.

849
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,960
 - Oh yeah, gardening.

850
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,800
 - There you go.

851
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,800
 Well, congrats, Martin Hill.

852
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,080
 - Yeah. - Of course.

853
00:25:59,080 --> 00:25:59,920
 - Here's one.

854
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,920
 This is going out to Aaron Hung.

855
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,240
 And it's the fact that in 2011,

856
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,760
 the largest sperm bank in the world stopped accepting sperm

857
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,240
 from redheads.

858
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,880
 - Sorry, Aaron, you got a bit of a--

859
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,800
 - It's a blue one.

860
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,840
 - It's a blue fact.

861
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,400
 There's no doubt about that.

862
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,280
 And I think it was--

863
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,280
 - It was just a canner really.

864
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,120
 - It's an anifact.

865
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:19,960
 - Yeah.

866
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,360
 - And the fact of course it was--

867
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,440
 - I think it was a lack of demand.

868
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,480
 I think it was classic anti-redhead prejudice.

869
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,480
 - That is prejudice.

870
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,320
 - Yeah.

871
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,920
 - There's an interesting thing in history.

872
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,080
 I read a paper about this that people have typically thought

873
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:35,920
 that people with red hair are very sort of sexually active.

874
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,880
 And they've had that reputation throughout history.

875
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,960
 But the research has found out that the reason

876
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,320
 that they had that reputation is because people just

877
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,000
 generally found them more attractive.

878
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,840
 - Oh right.

879
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,200
 (laughing)

880
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,640
 - And so they were having more sex,

881
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,160
 but it's just because everyone fancied them.

882
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,440
 - Yeah, right.

883
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,640
 - Oh, that's not my counter narrative

884
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,520
 to all the anti-gender prejudice.

885
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,360
 - Absolutely.

886
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,360
 - Good.

887
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,840
 - Wesley Vetter, you are now the proud custodian

888
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,720
 of this fact.

889
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:08,080
 The English language has more words borrowed from Hawaiian

890
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,560
 than from Welsh.

891
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,400
 - Really?

892
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,240
 - Yes.

893
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,360
 - Wesley, that one is now yours.

894
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,200
 This was an Andrew Murray original.

895
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,320
 - Yeah.

896
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,480
 And it's, I can't remember any words

897
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,240
 that are borrowed from Hawaiian now.

898
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,240
 - I like it.

899
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,080
 - Wiki.

900
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,080
 - Wiki.

901
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,400
 - Hula.

902
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,240
 - Hula.

903
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,080
 - I think Hula hoop.

904
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,720
 - Yeah, Hula dancing.

905
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,560
 - Yes.

906
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,440
 - But also I think the thing is that in Hawaii,

907
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,640
 they had lots of new plants that needed names.

908
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,280
 And so we took them from Hawaiian.

909
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,120
 - Right.

910
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,640
 - Whereas when we went into Wales,

911
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,720
 they had the same plants as we had.

912
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,560
 - Right.

913
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,320
 - Which is slightly like maybe leak.

914
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,720
 - No, we already had leaks.

915
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,560
 - Daffs?

916
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,400
 - Daffs, yeah.

917
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,240
 They still existed.

918
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,640
 You know, there was no need to give Welsh names to these things.

919
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,480
 - You're right.

920
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,600
 And also, let's not forget the Andy Welsh prejudice.

921
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,600
 - Of course.

922
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,160
 - Which, but one interesting thing is that everyone found

923
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,160
 the Welsh extreme.

924
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,160
 We attracted.

925
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,160
 - Yes.

926
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,160
 - Oh yeah.

927
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,400
 - Let's do another one.

928
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,720
 This we had a guest on in this episode, episode 10.

929
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,640
 And that guest was Eric Lampair.

930
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,640
 - Eric Lampair.

931
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,640
 - Eric Lampair.

932
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,640
 - I haven't seen him for years.

933
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,640
 - Well, do you know what?

934
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,640
 You can see him currently in a movie.

935
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,640
 - Oh.

936
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,640
 - So there's a new--

937
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,640
 - That's why I haven't seen him

938
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,840
 because that's what they--

939
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,800
 - So there's a movie out at the moment called

940
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,760
 Grief as the Thingwood Feathers,

941
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,040
 based on a max-ported book.

942
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,520
 And it's Benedict Cumberbatch.

943
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,480
 And there's a big black bird that appears in it.

944
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,320
 - Is he playing the bird?

945
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,320
 - He's inside the bird.

946
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,160
 - Wow.

947
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,000
 - Wow.

948
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,760
 - So you don't see Eric, but he's on Stilts

949
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,400
 and he is the bird in that film.

950
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,240
 - Very cool.

951
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,080
 - So we grew up.

952
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:36,920
 - Eric.

953
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,760
 - Yep.

954
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,600
 - What was his fact?

955
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,000
 - His fact was, in 1923,

956
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,040
 Jockey Frank Hayes won a race in Belmont Park in New York,

957
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,200
 despite being dead.

958
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,040
 - Wow.

959
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,040
 - Yeah, amazing fact.

960
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,360
 That's Emma Goven.

961
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,920
 And congratulations.

962
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,120
 This is now your fact.

963
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,160
 This was, he died on the final leg, Denny.

964
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,680
 I think he had a heart attack while on the horse,

965
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,240
 but the horse just kept running and won the race.

966
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,080
 - Right.

967
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,680
 - Yeah. - Gosh, that's amazing.

968
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,040
 - Have we got time for any more Andy or--

969
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,760
 - I think we've got time for three more.

970
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,520
 - Three more, okay.

971
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,560
 Well, I'll do one.

972
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:13,120
 This one was a Dan Shriver fight from episode 10.

973
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,680
 I've noticed things are fish.

974
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,880
 And Dan said some buddhist monks run marathons

975
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,240
 to achieve enlightenment.

976
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,240
 And that fact now belongs to Mr. Dan Turner.

977
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:28,840
 So Dan, congratulations.

978
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:32,280
 - Yeah, that was one of my favorite earliest facts

979
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,200
 on the podcast, which is this extraordinary thing

980
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,040
 that they run these insanely long marathons

981
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,840
 and the idea is that after,

982
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,000
 however many days of doing it,

983
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,480
 they would achieve enlightenment.

984
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,000
 So rather than meditating your way to it,

985
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,360
 you can actually bolt.

986
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,080
 - But the thing is about meditating

987
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,800
 as you can just sit there.

988
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,640
 - Right.

989
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,480
 - Yeah.

990
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,480
 - I think I would prefer to do that method

991
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,760
 of enlightenment than having to get your gym gear on.

992
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,880
 (laughing)

993
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,000
 - Rub your nipples with Vaseline.

994
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,080
 I mean, I'll be doing that even if I'm just sitting down.

995
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,160
 So that's a wash for me.

996
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,320
 - That's sort of yeah, accidentally achieving enlightenment.

997
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,400
 - Absolutely, yeah.

998
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,720
 - Runners do that, don't they?

999
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,560
 - Yes, they do.

1000
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,400
 - Oh, they do, they?

1001
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,240
 - Yeah.

1002
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,000
 - I thought we'd just getting an insight into your life, Andy.

1003
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,840
 - Okay.

1004
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,680
 (laughing)

1005
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,520
 - That's the thing.

1006
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,560
 - Otherwise you get jogger's nipple.

1007
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,240
 - Yeah, which can be very painful actually.

1008
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,440
 - Ooh, it sounds bad.

1009
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,040
 I've never run far enough to get jogger's nipple.

1010
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:21,880
 - I've had it.

1011
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,720
 - Have you?

1012
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,280
 - Did you butter them or?

1013
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,200
 - No, I just suffered for the next couple of days.

1014
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,040
 - Sensitive.

1015
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:28,880
 - Yeah.

1016
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,200
 (laughing)

1017
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,520
 - I should move on more facts.

1018
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,680
 - All right, let's have a couple more.

1019
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,800
 This one goes out to Ben Caligari.

1020
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,120
 Congratulations, Ben.

1021
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,800
 Because you're getting an absolute slammer.

1022
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,160
 It's that the Slovakian and Slovenian embassies

1023
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,000
 in Washington meet once a month

1024
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,400
 to exchange wrongly addressed mail.

1025
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,440
 - Brilliant.

1026
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,280
 - Yep.

1027
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,480
 - Again, an early classic.

1028
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,720
 I feel like that was one of the poster facts

1029
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,560
 in our early days.

1030
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,640
 - It was Slovakia Slovenia.

1031
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,480
 - Yeah.

1032
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,640
 - They're not very close.

1033
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,160
 They're close in a global sense, but they're not.

1034
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,320
 - Not in a European sense.

1035
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,160
 - No.

1036
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,000
 - Yeah, not in a European sense.

1037
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,840
 They're not very close.

1038
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,880
 They're probably close in an embassy sense.

1039
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,720
 - Oh yeah.

1040
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,560
 - Maybe, maybe.

1041
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,600
 - I don't even know if that's a clothe of those embassies.

1042
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,120
 (laughing)

1043
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,880
 - It's awful when the guy from Afghanistan

1044
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,920
 has to go and visit the guy from Zimbabwe.

1045
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,440
 (laughing)

1046
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,960
 - Yeah, but that's just a great fact.

1047
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,200
 - And do we have time for one more?

1048
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,040
 - Yeah.

1049
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:22,880
 - Let's do it.

1050
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,560
 This one is going out to Alan Clark.

1051
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,000
 In the 18th century,

1052
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,040
 there were genuine medicines called

1053
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:33,840
 Alan's Nippel Linament for those joggers out there.

1054
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,320
 Grymsden's ice enough,

1055
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,840
 Miller's worm plums,

1056
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,120
 and Italian buzzing friend.

1057
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:40,960
 - This was your effect, eh?

1058
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,800
 - I remember that.

1059
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,640
 I remember that.

1060
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,800
 That was a great fact to find.

1061
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,120
 I can't remember how I found it now, but yeah.

1062
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:51,120
 Miller's worm plums is such a dodgy sounding.

1063
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,400
 It's like they put, Miller is a very nice word,

1064
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,280
 like our colleague Ann Miller,

1065
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,400
 but worm and plums are two of the worst words

1066
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,040
 you could hear from a doctor.

1067
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:00,880
 (laughing)

1068
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,720
 - If you've got,

1069
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,200
 don't the same sentence, you've got plum worms.

1070
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,560
 That's really bad.

1071
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:09,680
 - Yeah, I think it just meant that's the unit of medicine,

1072
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,680
 like a lozenge.

1073
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,360
 It's just a little plum that you have to take

1074
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,480
 to deal with your worms.

1075
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,920
 It's almost as if they've surrounded the unpleasant word worm

1076
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,320
 with Miller and plums,

1077
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,760
 which are, you know, I don't mind a plum.

1078
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,600
 I love a plum, actually.

1079
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,600
 - Do you?

1080
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,440
 - Yes, I cook.

1081
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,280
 It doesn't matter.

1082
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,800
 We can move on, but I cook.

1083
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,560
 - And then I want to hear more.

1084
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,400
 - I cook rather than nice plum and oat slice,

1085
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,520
 which I'm sure I've brought into the office for you guys
