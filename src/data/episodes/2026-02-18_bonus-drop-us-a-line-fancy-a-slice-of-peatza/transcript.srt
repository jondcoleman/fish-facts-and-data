1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
 - They don't want it, they don't want it.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,900
 (playful music)

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:11,040
 - Hi.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,560
 - Hey Andy, how's it going guys?

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,560
 - It's going well, thank you.

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,400
 - How are you guys?

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,680
 - Just in a really good show with Maddie Motte.

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,480
 - Yes, and that'll be out before long.

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,400
 - Yeah.

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,720
 - But for now, welcome to Drop us a Line.

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,500
 Our audience feedback show is Drop us a Line.

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,260
 - We all knew this was coming.

13
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,100
 (laughing)

14
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,400
 - I knew when you sent the email the other day saying,

15
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,500
 "Guys, we need to do an episode of Drop us a Line."

16
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,620
 That's when I first knew.

17
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,420
 - Can you please put your fingers out

18
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,420
 and start fabricating some emails for me to read out

19
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,260
 in a music way?

20
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,480
 (laughing)

21
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,560
 Thank you everyone for listening

22
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,300
 and for watching Drop us a Line.

23
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,480
 The inbox is bulging.

24
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,320
 - Beautiful.

25
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,720
 - It's full of your fantastic correspondence,

26
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,200
 which has been flooding in to podcast@qiu.com.

27
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,800
 - So Wednesday afternoon.

28
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,640
 - Yeah.

29
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,080
 - We're in Central London.

30
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,040
 - Yeah, in the QI office, as we always are.

31
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,160
 - Yeah, I'm just trying to set the scenes.

32
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,040
 - Yeah, nice.

33
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,080
 - This is James, I'm Dan.

34
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:02,920
 - I'm Andy.

35
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,760
 - Yep.

36
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,240
 - I think the scene is set.

37
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,240
 - Start of February, in 2026, yeah.

38
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,240
 - AD.

39
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,880
 (laughing)

40
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,600
 - I think everyone's had the context they need.

41
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,840
 - No, that's it.

42
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,080
 - That's it.

43
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,160
 Let's get to the emails.

44
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,840
 - Just a quick, fun name to start.

45
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,680
 Thought that'd be nice.

46
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,520
 - Okay.

47
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,040
 - And the correspondence are...

48
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,360
 - Actually, he has got a great name,

49
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,960
 but he's written in about another person

50
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,800
 with a great name.

51
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,120
 - Rob Shanks.

52
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:29,960
 - Great name.

53
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,800
 - Great name.

54
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,640
 - Right.

55
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,320
 18th century MP, Gregory Turner was a noted book collector.

56
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,520
 And when his great uncle, Sir Gregory Page,

57
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,560
 died without any children,

58
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,040
 Gregory Turner inherited the estate,

59
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,600
 but he was required to take on the name.

60
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,440
 So he became...

61
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,280
 - Yep.

62
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,120
 - Beautiful.

63
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,360
 - Sir Gregory Page Turner.

64
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,200
 - It's good.

65
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,040
 - That's really good.

66
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,280
 - Who was the correspondent called?

67
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,400
 - Rob Shanks.

68
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,880
 - Sense his name.

69
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,520
 - Sense his name.

70
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,800
 - I'm gonna rob your Shanks.

71
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,040
 (laughing)

72
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,160
 - Shank is a verb in golf.

73
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,000
 - Oh, is it?

74
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 - The bit where the shaft hits the head is called the huzzle.

75
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,520
 And if when you hit the ball,

76
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,920
 you accidentally hit the huzzle,

77
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,480
 the ball goes off in a weird direction

78
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,480
 and it's called a shank.

79
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,800
 - That's really good.

80
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,320
 So Rob Shanks.

81
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,160
 Brilliant.

82
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,000
 - Very good.

83
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,800
 - Well, he points out, if you are a book collector

84
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,720
 and you then become a Gregory Page Turner,

85
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,680
 is this a rare case of determinative nominism?

86
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,520
 - Yeah.

87
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,440
 (laughing)

88
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,280
 - It's good.

89
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,120
 - Really good.

90
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,960
 - Very strong.

91
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,800
 - We're off the blocks.

92
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,640
 - Yeah.

93
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,480
 - Rick Romalli.

94
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,320
 - Right.

95
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,680
 Now don't worry, you're gonna get deja vu when I read this out.

96
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,520
 - Okay.

97
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,120
 - Just thought you'd want to know that Northwest,

98
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,360
 which is in Southeast North Carolina,

99
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,800
 is due east of due west.

100
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,520
 Exactly as one would expect.

101
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,760
 - So we did have a very similar fact a few weeks ago.

102
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,280
 I don't think it was exactly the same.

103
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,120
 - No.

104
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,400
 We mentioned two places that are both in South Carolina.

105
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,240
 Right?

106
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,600
 But this fact, I've written it down to explain.

107
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,160
 We mentioned Dew West, which is in South Carolina.

108
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,160
 - Okay.

109
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,040
 - And it's relationship to another place in South Carolina

110
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,880
 called North.

111
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,720
 - Yep.

112
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,280
 - A North is southeast of Dew West,

113
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,280
 but they're both in South Carolina.

114
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,560
 But this fact is about a place in Southeast North Carolina

115
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,960
 called Northwest, which is due east

116
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,920
 of South Carolina's Dew West.

117
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,040
 - No questions.

118
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,800
 - Okay, no questions.

119
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,680
 - That's very complicated.

120
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,640
 - I think I made it pretty clear.

121
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,560
 - No, you did.

122
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,720
 - It was good.

123
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,720
 - It was very good.

124
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,960
 - Should we have another?

125
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,960
 - Yeah.

126
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,200
 - Caitlin Foukes.

127
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,640
 - Yep.

128
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,480
 - Arguably.

129
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,320
 - Yes.

130
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,760
 - She points out she is sort of a sentence person.

131
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,640
 (laughing)

132
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,600
 - She says, "Am I disqualified due to the necessity

133
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,160
 for a humorous mispronunciation?"

134
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,000
 - Caitlin.

135
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,840
 - Not on this show.

136
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,680
 - Welcome.

137
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,360
 (laughing)

138
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,040
 - Caitlin writes, "I was listening to the latest drop

139
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,800
 "as a line, and as so often happens,

140
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,360
 "James' face blindness was mentioned.

141
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,400
 "I was thinking that, of course,

142
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,080
 "though he can't picture himself or anyone else,

143
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,600
 "he will know things like,

144
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,040
 "James has curly hair."

145
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,440
 - What's a terrible example?

146
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,160
 - That's such a bad example.

147
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,720
 - I no longer have curly hair.

148
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,680
 - Listeners, James no longer has curly hair.

149
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,400
 But Danway's glasses, or Caitlin says,

150
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,640
 and he looks like a stickman.

151
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,600
 Very funny Caitlin.

152
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,920
 - Very true.

153
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,200
 - So this naturally made I think of a cool game.

154
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,520
 The game is Guess Who.

155
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,520
 - My suggestion is that you make James play Guess Who,

156
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,880
 but entirely with the most important people of his life,

157
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,720
 in his life.

158
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,800
 He has a picture of the person,

159
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,240
 and all the little tiles have names.

160
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,560
 He spends the game trying to work out

161
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,120
 which of the people he loves his faces he's looking at

162
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,920
 using only memorized propositions about their appearance

163
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,040
 and yes, no questions.

164
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,600
 - I can mostly do that in fairness

165
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,560
 of people I know really well, I can recognize them.

166
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,160
 Due to the fact that I know my wife has a fringe.

167
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,000
 - Exactly.

168
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,840
 - I'm on there.

169
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,840
 - James, once you said to me,

170
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:01,840
 hey, was Fonella at this very random train station

171
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,480
 on this day at this time?

172
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,880
 And I was like, I happen to know that she was.

173
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,560
 And you recognized her from, she was in the distance.

174
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,400
 You were with Paulina.

175
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,360
 You recognized her from her walk as she was walking away.

176
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,200
 - Oh, yeah.

177
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,200
 - Yeah, yeah.

178
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,560
 She also had a head in the hands going,

179
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,640
 and that fucking damn.

180
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,400
 (all laughing)

181
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,240
 - I keep telling her to stop doing that, public.

182
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,080
 - That's too obvious.

183
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:26,920
 - That's interesting.

184
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,200
 Yeah, I can recognize people's gate quite well.

185
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,920
 - You should work for the CIA.

186
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,760
 - Should I?

187
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,800
 - Who's to say you don't already?

188
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,640
 - Uh-huh.

189
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,440
 - Well, they do complicated things like that, don't they?

190
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,280
 - Do they?

191
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,120
 - I don't know.

192
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,960
 - Ask him.

193
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,800
 - Ask him.

194
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,120
 (all laughing)

195
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,600
 - That's exactly what someone working for the CIA would say.

196
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,440
 - Very good point.

197
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,160
 (all laughing)

198
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,440
 - Seems like, I mean, one of us doesn't work for the CIA.

199
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,800
 - I don't love the CIA.

200
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,920
 - But it's always the one you least expect, isn't it?

201
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,440
 - Guys, can we just drop the pretence?

202
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,200
 This has been a CIA podcast for 12 years.

203
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,040
 - Right.

204
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,360
 - It was a thick, thick dossier about each of us

205
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,360
 written by the other two.

206
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,080
 (all laughing)

207
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,920
 - And, of course, runs the CIA.

208
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,520
 (all laughing)

209
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,640
 Tony Elmquist says, "Hi, guys, writing this in real time

210
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,480
 while listening to "Drop us a Line."

211
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,880
 "Danic Dotes."

212
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,400
 That's the show.

213
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,600
 That is all.

214
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,040
 - Just my stories.

215
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,880
 - I think so.

216
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,680
 - Right.

217
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,680
 - "Danic Dotes." - Good.

218
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,520
 - Yeah.

219
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,760
 - I feel like that's your BBC One Primetime show,

220
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,840
 where you and my guests on and simply tell things about your life.

221
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,160
 (all laughing)

222
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,120
 So I asked them a question, and before they answer, I say,

223
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,640
 "I tell you why I ask." - This is the show.

224
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,320
 - Yeah, that's what the show's called.

225
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,440
 - I tell you why I ask.

226
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,680
 - No, it's called "Danic Dotes." (all laughing)

227
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,680
 - That's how we got here in the show. - That's how we got there.

228
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,520
 - Okay.

229
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,240
 - No, no, no, I'll tell you why I ask, is good.

230
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,320
 But I think that can be your cat phrase

231
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,440
 within the show, "Danic Dotes."

232
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,080
 - Yes. - I think that's a genuinely

233
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,600
 a funny idea for a show.

234
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,600
 - Okay, well, good suggestion.

235
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,600
 - Good suggestion. - "Danic Dotes."

236
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,800
 - Good suggestion, as a show. - Thank you.

237
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,520
 - "Jamison Davies" sends in,

238
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,720
 fun little bit of bonus "Bream."

239
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,400
 It's my new name for the extra-fact bit.

240
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,440
 - Bonus "Bream."

241
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,520
 - Can you think of another fish beginning with "B"?

242
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,840
 - Baracuda. - Baracuda.

243
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,240
 - "Burnus Bass," "Burnus Baracuda."

244
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,680
 Yep, those are both good.

245
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,680
 And maybe this format...

246
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,440
 (all laughing)

247
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,400
 Maybe this bit will evolve over the next few weeks.

248
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,880
 - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah.

249
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,120
 - "Jamison" writes in.

250
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,560
 I'm sure a lot of folks will write in about this.

251
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,560
 I don't know how to tell you, "Jamison," you're the first.

252
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,680
 Almost never when someone says,

253
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,880
 "I'm so sorry, I'm probably troughing through

254
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,600
 like 40,000 emails about this."

255
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,480
 They always are the only one who's sent to the Zen.

256
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,280
 - Yeah. - But as a New Yorker,

257
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,000
 I have to point out the best building height related pun.

258
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,400
 - Oh yeah. - Oh, okay, you said.

259
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,400
 - This is to do the fact that we did a fact

260
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,200
 when Olga Hock was on, which was all about in Japan,

261
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,200
 height of its tallest tower, the sky tree.

262
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,400
 - The sky tree is the exact same number

263
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,920
 as a pun of the old area it's from.

264
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,920
 - Okay. - Well...

265
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,240
 - It was one of those in New York.

266
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,600
 - It was one of those slap bang.

267
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,640
 One world trade center.

268
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,440
 - Oh yeah. - It's only one meter high.

269
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,920
 - That's right.

270
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,040
 But through an incredible optical illusion,

271
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,800
 they made it look massive.

272
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,960
 No, formerly known as the Freedom Tower.

273
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,960
 It was made to be 17, 76 feet tall.

274
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,040
 Referencing, of course, when we declared independence

275
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,040
 from you lot.

276
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,640
 - And how's it going?

277
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:23,400
 - Sorry. - Sorry.

278
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:28,360
 We've got a new in real life bit.

279
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,280
 - Great. - Okay, remind me what that is.

280
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,440
 - We've spoken about a subject.

281
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,240
 Someone in real life has experienced that subject.

282
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,640
 And so they can report back on it.

283
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,280
 - Well, Francis O'Donnell has been living in real life.

284
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,120
 Love the show.

285
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,560
 I listen to every podcast most more than once.

286
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,800
 - Every podcast.

287
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,320
 - Every podcast we've made.

288
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,240
 - I think everyone we've made.

289
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,400
 - Okay.

290
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,720
 - Could not believe you were talking about Pete and Bogs.

291
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,560
 - Oh yeah.

292
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,240
 - I am one of these people who heats my house with Pete.

293
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,480
 You're one of the two percent of people in Ireland.

294
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,800
 - That's right. - Yeah.

295
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,560
 - When my dad bought the land for my house in Connemara

296
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,080
 and I was speaking part of Ireland,

297
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,080
 we were given a piece of land in the bog

298
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,920
 that we were free to take Pete from.

299
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,080
 We call it turf.

300
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,280
 My grandfather used to cut his turf by hand

301
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,160
 with a special long shovel.

302
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,360
 Nowadays it's done with massive machines.

303
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,800
 As is everything in this industrial world.

304
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,320
 (laughing)

305
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,520
 - Well, not in the digital world that we live in.

306
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,320
 - In the digital world.

307
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,280
 - It was slightly beyond the industrial world.

308
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,280
 Some might argue.

309
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,120
 - We are, we are, we are, we are.

310
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,120
 - I'm sure the people of Ireland are as well.

311
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,120
 (laughing)

312
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,360
 - No, that's not what I was, oh my God.

313
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,200
 (laughing)

314
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,040
 - No, I'm the bad guy.

315
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,240
 And he adds, Francis adds, just FYI,

316
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,640
 there is still heaps of Irish whiskey made using Pete.

317
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,440
 In fact, I've had pizza made with Pete instead of wood

318
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,440
 and let me tell you, it tastes awful.

319
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,280
 (laughing)

320
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,040
 - Pizza, is it spelled that way as well?

321
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,880
 - It's not.

322
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,720
 - Oh, what?

323
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,720
 - It should be.

324
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,560
 - Come on.

325
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,560
 - I think it tastes so bad that no one known as bothered

326
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,560
 even using that slap obvious name.

327
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,560
 - Oh, that's great.

328
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,520
 - Pizza is crying out to be made.

329
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:11,400
 Will Taylor writes in about another of Dan's secret lives

330
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,640
 revealed.

331
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,480
 - Okay.

332
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,400
 - I'm a Brit living in New York.

333
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,200
 I have been listening to your show since basically

334
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,480
 the beginning and I enjoy the show even more now.

335
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,640
 I live abroad as it's a little connection with home.

336
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,640
 - Oh.

337
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,400
 - I'm sure I look a little weird giggling to myself

338
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,480
 while walking about town with the podcast in my ears,

339
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,600
 but if there's one place in the world

340
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,080
 where no one cares how mad you look,

341
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,480
 it's New York City.

342
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,760
 (laughing)

343
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,520
 - This is relevant, I'm setting the scene.

344
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,360
 - Yeah.

345
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,200
 - I normally leave out the bits,

346
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,880
 we will say how marvellous we are.

347
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,320
 - What year did he write?

348
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,160
 - This year?

349
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,000
 - AD.

350
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,840
 - AD.

351
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,080
 (laughing)

352
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,560
 AD, so I'm just...

353
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,040
 - AD, just setting the scene.

354
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,880
 - Absolutely.

355
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,840
 - I was listening to last week's show

356
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,120
 while walking into the office.

357
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,960
 I nearly fell over when I walked right past Dan

358
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,840
 just as he was talking in my ears about fish being

359
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,520
 the number one comedy podcast.

360
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,440
 A closer look revealed it was not Dan IRL,

361
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,080
 but an advert on the bus stop.

362
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,400
 It turns out Dan is moonlighting

363
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,080
 as a D or model.

364
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,160
 (laughing)

365
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,880
 - As you can see in the attached photo,

366
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,000
 it definitely is Dan, even if he tries to deny it.

367
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,840
 Over to you guys.

368
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,680
 - Okay.

369
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,520
 (laughing)

370
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,760
 - I mean, it's just another generic.

371
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,320
 - Do you know what these...

372
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,480
 - It's uncanny.

373
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,760
 - I have a family WhatsApp with all the Shribers,

374
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,240
 the ones in Austria's, the ones that live in different countries,

375
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,360
 and there's a constant thing where it's known as Hot Dan,

376
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,240
 where scene Hot Dan again, it's getting a lot of work,

377
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,400
 and I'll always get sent things like this.

378
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,520
 - Yeah. - Hot Dan.

379
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,800
 - Hot Dan is thriving.

380
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,600
 - The specs, the hair, the frown, the beard.

381
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,440
 - The frown.

382
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,040
 (laughing)

383
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,960
 - It's got, it's got the frowning.

384
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,680
 - The slightly constipated look.

385
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,080
 (laughing)

386
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,920
 - The dribble.

387
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,400
 (laughing)

388
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,760
 - Yeah, it's you.

389
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,720
 - I do see the similarity.

390
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,520
 But, I guess who this guy came up, you'd say it's Dan.

391
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,840
 - In context, if we were on tour, in Australia,

392
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:11,000
 and we were just arrived at the theater in Brisbane,

393
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,680
 and I walked through the door,

394
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,600
 and that person came over and said,

395
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,080
 "Oh, James, you're here.

396
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,080
 "I would assume it was you."

397
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,160
 - Okay, I would do a show with this guy.

398
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,440
 - No problem.

399
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,280
 - I would like to.

400
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,280
 - If I had a context, I think if not in context,

401
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,320
 I wouldn't recognise either of you, but I think...

402
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,120
 - I'd say, Dan, you're looking really well.

403
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,200
 You've been using that cream I gave you, whatever.

404
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,120
 - You've got a little bit of dribble just on the side.

405
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,480
 - No, he's cleaned off the dribble, wow.

406
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,800
 - Dan's had his host this morning, hasn't he?

407
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,320
 - Let's do a tour where there's always a different me

408
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,360
 on stage before I come on,

409
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,720
 but I'm not gonna tell you guys which shows it's happening.

410
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,440
 So it's like two or three times over a 12-show tour,

411
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,280
 and see if you notice it.

412
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,600
 - Well, is that guy for the Muppets?

413
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,440
 (laughing)

414
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,080
 - Guy smiley sitting on stage.

415
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,920
 - Hot Dan.

416
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,760
 - Hot Dan's on stage.

417
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,000
 - Well, as your hot Dan's, poke us to qi.com.

418
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,880
 Let's live and up that inbox a bit.

419
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,440
 (laughing)

420
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,760
 Brilliant, so thank you, Will.

421
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,600
 - Hey, I did a bit of real life this week.

422
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,440
 - Tommy.

423
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,320
 - Would you mind if I mention it quickly?

424
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,400
 - I was... - That like that?

425
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,920
 - A Danic joke.

426
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,760
 - So I was in it.

427
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,600
 - Anyway, ask.

428
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,600
 (laughing)

429
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,680
 - I went to a brilliant second-hand bookshop

430
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,320
 that I always go to called Michael's Books.

431
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,440
 It's in Ramsgate.

432
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,280
 Absolutely love it.

433
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,560
 And I went to get my bus,

434
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,960
 and I could see in the distance the local weather spoons.

435
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,120
 And a thing that came up in my head was,

436
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,120
 I wonder what the closest table to the toilet is.

437
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,120
 (laughing)

438
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,040
 Because we mentioned on the last drop of the line,

439
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,760
 the, as part of the top trumps cards that they make,

440
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,200
 one of the options is closest steps to the toilet.

441
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,040
 - So is this someone in Ramsgate, sorry, Mark?

442
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,880
 - In Ramsgate.

443
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,960
 - The giant one, right?

444
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,160
 - The giant one in Ramsgate.

445
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,480
 - So I imagine you approached you else,

446
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,000
 the Matrix D, good evening.

447
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,920
 Yeah, I'd like a table for one, please.

448
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,760
 - Yeah, the toilets.

449
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,560
 - I assume all the tables will be taken in that area,

450
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,160
 but if you have something close.

451
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,320
 - You slip in with 20, you say,

452
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,480
 there's anything you can do for me to get me close

453
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,320
 to that toilet.

454
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,320
 - Yeah.

455
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,640
 - So I went in, I went upstairs,

456
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,800
 I found the closest table to the toilets,

457
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,840
 sat down with my pint of ruddles, and-

458
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,680
 (laughing)

459
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,520
 - Oh my God, that's all I think is stealth, Mark.

460
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,600
 (laughing)

461
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,120
 - I should have said, we walked into this, James.

462
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,720
 We walked smack into it.

463
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,720
 - I didn't drink ruddles,

464
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,920
 I just had an orange juice lemonade,

465
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,440
 I'm not drinking at the moment, so it felt a shame.

466
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,280
 - Damn, it felt a shame.

467
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,360
 - Sonella doesn't listen to this show,

468
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,520
 you can tell us how many pint of ruddles you had.

469
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,400
 And so I sat there, and so I now know

470
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,720
 how many steps it takes to get there.

471
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,920
 - Okay, are we gonna have a guess?

472
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,520
 - Yeah, why don't you have a guess?

473
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,200
 - I think it would take 70 steps.

474
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,040
 - 70 steps.

475
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,120
 - 'Cause they are usually a long way from the seats.

476
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,000
 - And Dan does walk with tiny little steps.

477
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,200
 - I do, I do, because leaving a trailer dribble

478
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,520
 behind me is like a snail, like a slug.

479
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,360
 - No, but I presume that if you're going to the Lou,

480
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,680
 you'll have taken down your trousers first as a precaution.

481
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,640
 So naturally your steps are a bit smaller, aren't they?

482
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,360
 - Or we've been to the pub together before,

483
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,960
 that is exactly how I do it.

484
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,240
 (laughing)

485
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,080
 - So 70 steps, I'll say, I'll do a classic down,

486
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,920
 I'll say two million.

487
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,880
 - Okay, I'll say 150.

488
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,720
 - 150.

489
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,640
 - So from the closest table, from the closest table,

490
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,480
 I know what's gonna happen.

491
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,480
 It took me 15 steps, however, I know what the official number is

492
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:33,000
 because while I was ordering my lemonade and orange juice,

493
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,160
 I discovered that you can also buy six pines of ruttles.

494
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,280
 - Oh, the top Trumps cards for the weather spins.

495
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,120
 - Wow.

496
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,680
 - And so it's officially 22 steps.

497
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,760
 And I thought, okay, well that must be the least amount

498
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,320
 of steps that you can get there.

499
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,160
 - This is amazing.

500
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,040
 - Well it turns out that there's a lot of these pubs

501
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,960
 that two steps it requires to get to the pub.

502
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,960
 - I can understand that.

503
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,800
 - Okay, well can you--

504
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,040
 - A lot of weather spins have an open drain

505
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,520
 around the edge of the room though.

506
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,960
 - Yeah, and you can just pop over there.

507
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,800
 - What makes sense?

508
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,480
 - I actually, as soon as I walk through the front door,

509
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,360
 I pull my pants down, my ankles.

510
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,360
 - You've got to mark your territory.

511
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,400
 That's the thing.

512
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,920
 Dan, I'm so impressed that you bought these.

513
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,600
 - I wouldn't have, but the proceeds go to charity.

514
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,720
 - These aren't as--

515
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,560
 - They're very boring.

516
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,760
 - They're very boring categories.

517
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,600
 - Very boring.

518
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,440
 - These can be judged.

519
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,880
 - One interesting thing is on the back,

520
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:28,000
 I said, oh, you could have different carpets on there.

521
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,720
 In actual fact, they've got the Ramsgate weather spins.

522
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,560
 - Yes, your Ramsgate one, isn't it?

523
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,880
 - I suppose that's the flagship one.

524
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,520
 It's the largest in the fleet.

525
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,840
 - But let me tell you one extra thing

526
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,320
 that happened on the way in.

527
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,320
 - As I walked in, there's a big bookcase

528
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,200
 of free books that get given away.

529
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,280
 I naturally, anywhere I walk, if there's free books,

530
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,120
 I walk up to it.

531
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,120
 So I walk up to it and I see this book sitting there.

532
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,360
 The spoils are played by Jesse Eisenberg of Now You See Me.

533
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,680
 So I'm now sitting upstairs with my Jesse Eisenberg book.

534
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,520
 - What is going on?

535
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,400
 - Mapping out the steps and I open up the book.

536
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,240
 - Oh my god.

537
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:10,240
 - And it is a signed edition of Jesse Eisenberg.

538
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,600
 - And we recognize that signature

539
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,920
 from the Now You See Me signed card.

540
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:20,040
 - My now collection of Jesse Eisenberg signed memorabilia.

541
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:24,320
 - Yeah, so there's something going on here.

542
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,320
 I don't know what it is.

543
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,640
 - I genuinely felt as if you had come down to Ramsgate

544
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,160
 and left this book in there.

545
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,960
 - But that was the way of forcing that card

546
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,280
 into your hand.

547
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,840
 - Honestly, I think it's not much for Foss

548
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,840
 to put Jesse Eisenberg book in dance local Roodle Center.

549
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,000
 - No, who's gonna pick that up?

550
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,920
 - That book's not seeing any other figure prints on it.

551
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,600
 - I've sat this up three years ago.

552
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,880
 - He's been sat in that pub.

553
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,200
 - Oh, a play by Jesse Eisenberg.

554
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,320
 - Can't believe this didn't leap off the shelf.

555
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,600
 That's amazing.

556
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,960
 That's so funny.

557
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,160
 - Yeah, so a little adventure.

558
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,000
 - Really good.

559
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,520
 Victoria Keen has a little correction for us.

560
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,840
 I wonder if it's a full-harkening,

561
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,120
 but we were slightly insensitive about something.

562
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,960
 - Oh dear.

563
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,480
 - Well, judge for yourself.

564
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,800
 - Long time listen to here and I'm so sorry to write in.

565
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,920
 I was listening to not one,

566
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,480
 but two recent drop-as-align episodes

567
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,520
 where the procedure to turn a breach baby,

568
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,280
 so where the baby is the wrong way,

569
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,840
 and it needs to be turned.

570
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,680
 It's called external cephalic version,

571
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,000
 like, you know, inversion, reversion, you know,

572
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,600
 turning, cephalic has in the head.

573
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,280
 - Right, okay, yeah, I got it.

574
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,680
 And externalism on the outside, yeah, right, right.

575
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,920
 Was described as a massage.

576
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:46,560
 I felt compelled to write as it is absolutely not a massage.

577
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,560
 - That's painful as hell.

578
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,400
 I've had two breach babies turned by ECV,

579
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,600
 and as any person who's been through it will tell you,

580
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,560
 it is highly uncomfortable.

581
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,640
 They offer gas and air during the procedure.

582
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,240
 That's how painful it is.

583
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,320
 - Can I say I've had one massage in my life

584
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,360
 and I was very uncomfortable as well.

585
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,600
 - So actually, Victoria, James has his own cross-to-bear.

586
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,600
 - Yeah.

587
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,160
 - And did she go horse riding afterwards?

588
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,960
 - I don't think so.

589
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,800
 Poor man.

590
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:15,640
 So, you know, she just says it was uncomfortable,

591
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,560
 but definitely worth it.

592
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,840
 She's not trying to put anyone out.

593
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,480
 Was it work brilliantly for her medical procedure, yes,

594
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,920
 but a massage, absolutely not.

595
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,600
 Apologies, Victoria.

596
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,880
 We stand corrected.

597
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,240
 - I really like that as part of that fact

598
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,960
 about how the baby turns around,

599
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,240
 is that something I always say to someone

600
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,080
 if they're expecting their first child,

601
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,000
 when they're holding the baby,

602
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,960
 always tap the baby's bum with a rhythm of a heartbeat

603
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:44,080
 because their bum will have been right next to the heartbeat

604
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,720
 in the final stages of the pregnancy,

605
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,240
 and that's where they feel most comfortable,

606
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,400
 like they're back in the womb.

607
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,720
 So just a little bum, do-dum, do-dum, do-dum.

608
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,560
 - And how do you do it?

609
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,280
 - 'Cause I remember you doing it.

610
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,120
 - And this is medically.

611
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:56,960
 - Dr. Shriver.

612
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,800
 - Yes.

613
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,800
 - Stands other bright-dive BBC show.

614
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,880
 (laughing)

615
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,600
 There's a strange man in here, tapping baby's bum.

616
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,320
 - How long does this bum tapping soothing affect last?

617
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,720
 'Cause I remember you telling it to me.

618
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,040
 - My, my mum still does it to me, Jaly.

619
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,320
 (laughing)

620
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,160
 - That's, considering she's in Sydney, that's...

621
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,960
 - She has a surrogate, it comes over.

622
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,800
 - She has one of those, you know, those hands

623
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,360
 that was invented by what she called?

624
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,200
 - Margaret Atwoods.

625
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,840
 - Margaret Atwoods for signing things remotely.

626
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,040
 She's got one of those for tapping thumbs.

627
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,240
 - Good Lord.

628
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,080
 - I don't know.

629
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:33,920
 - Two weeks, Andy?

630
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,960
 - I don't know.

631
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,960
 - Oh, I think it lasts.

632
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,800
 - Okay.

633
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:43,160
 - Tom writes in, "Right, we've got a fish fight."

634
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,000
 - Cool.

635
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,160
 - And that's not the title, obviously.

636
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,720
 (laughing)

637
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,920
 - What do you mean?

638
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,880
 Is this a new section?

639
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,880
 - It's a new section.

640
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,600
 - What's the theme?

641
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,680
 - We've got two people writing in saying

642
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,320
 almost completely opposite things about the same subject.

643
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,160
 - Okay.

644
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,160
 - Which I love.

645
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,000
 - Yeah.

646
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,840
 - It just goes to show.

647
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,520
 - It would be a very boring world if we were all alike.

648
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,400
 - What about argument, Connor?

649
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,760
 - Can it be fished up a bit?

650
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,280
 - Um.

651
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,120
 - Fight.

652
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,960
 - Rao.

653
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,680
 - Rao.

654
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,520
 - Rao, Rao.

655
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,800
 - Rao, Rao, your boat.

656
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,280
 (laughing)

657
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,280
 - I'm writing it down.

658
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:20,560
 - I didn't need to write Rao three times.

659
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,160
 That's eating up our time, isn't it?

660
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:27,000
 - Okay, Rao, Rao, Rao, your boat, brilliant.

661
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 - Tom in the blue corner against Colin Aspery

662
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,520
 in the red corner.

663
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,400
 Tom writes, "Loving the new episode,

664
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,280
 no such thing as de-bredsion."

665
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,840
 - Colin says, "I hate it."

666
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,120
 (laughing)

667
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,640
 (laughing)

668
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:47,320
 - But a minor correction to Andy's comments

669
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,560
 about fight-a-pilots in the Tokyo section.

670
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,400
 Do you remember I said fight-a-pilots

671
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,800
 can move their eyes independently?

672
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,640
 - Oh yeah.

673
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,640
 - Yes, Tom says it's a patchy helicopter crew

674
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,920
 who need that eye independence

675
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,000
 because the helmet they wear includes,

676
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,720
 I'm just gonna read this directly because it's bizarre.

677
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,840
 The helmet includes a molecule that tracks

678
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,440
 where the eye is looking and this molecule

679
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,520
 can be slaved to the 30 millimeter gun

680
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,840
 underneath the helicopter for targeting.

681
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,880
 This way, the gun can simply look at the target

682
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,160
 to aim the weapon, which makes things faster and easier

683
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,680
 than some kind of handheld system.

684
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,520
 - Yeah, clever.

685
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,480
 - So you're right eye, just look at something,

686
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,400
 and then you fire?

687
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,240
 - Yeah, right.

688
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,080
 - That's nuts.

689
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,480
 - Yeah, that's interesting.

690
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,400
 But what if you get it mixed up?

691
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,560
 - What do you mean?

692
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,320
 - What if you forget the eye?

693
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,520
 That's doing it, you know what I mean?

694
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,560
 - Both eyes are gonna be looking

695
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,160
 in the same direction, generally.

696
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,240
 - Oh, that's the point though.

697
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,400
 - Oh, so you got independent eyes?

698
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,720
 - I think the right eye, let's say,

699
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,960
 is the one that's wearing the molecule,

700
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,560
 which is, you know, wired up to the gun.

701
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,040
 What if you accidentally use your left eye

702
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,400
 and you look down at the end of the sandwich

703
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,320
 so then you blow up your own sandwich?

704
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,520
 - These people are very highly trained.

705
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,680
 - Time to understand that.

706
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,800
 - They've cut to go through years and years and years

707
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,360
 of training, even just to fly the helicopter,

708
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,600
 let alone be in these terrible situations

709
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,080
 where you're in a dogfight against an enemy.

710
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:04,920
 - Yes.

711
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,920
 - You can blow you up at any second.

712
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,000
 - Probably they know which eye is which.

713
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,640
 - And probably it's not a time for sandwiches.

714
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,480
 - No.

715
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,360
 - Yeah, I hear you.

716
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,160
 - Okay, it sounds like you're in Colin's corner.

717
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,320
 (laughing)

718
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,880
 - Yeah, I hated the show as well.

719
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,480
 (laughing)

720
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,320
 - Right.

721
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,120
 - Colin, Asbury, or to give him his full title,

722
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,680
 "Major, Loki, Asbury, US Air Force."

723
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,520
 - Here we go.

724
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,200
 - What does that mean?

725
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,960
 Is it an is that a code name?

726
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,560
 - I think Loki is a call sign.

727
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,400
 - Oh.

728
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,480
 - L-O-K-I, like the God of mischief though.

729
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,360
 So who knows if he's telling the truth.

730
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,880
 - That's true.

731
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,760
 - Let's assume he is.

732
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,560
 Colin says it might seem like fighter pilots

733
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,960
 are looking at multiple things at once,

734
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,640
 but actually that's not quite correct.

735
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,240
 I am a fighter pilot for the US Air Force.

736
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,160
 I was stationed in England at Lake and Heath.

737
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,000
 - Yeah.

738
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,440
 - When I happened upon the podcast,

739
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,200
 and we use what is called a composite cross check

740
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,600
 to keep track of all the screens and gauges and everything.

741
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,760
 So you need to always be watching a few things,

742
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,560
 and that's the hub where you're always looking at,

743
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,160
 and then there are other sensors and screens

744
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,080
 which are kind of out on spokes away from the hub, right?

745
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,000
 So your eyes never really split,

746
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,160
 but if I want a younger pilot to be looking at two things at once,

747
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,880
 I tell them to lobster eye.

748
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,720
 - Lobster eye.

749
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,600
 - Yeah, implying they should look at two things at once,

750
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,600
 but it's just not possible.

751
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,960
 So you shift your hub a little bit to a new bit of equipment,

752
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,960
 and now you need to look slightly differently

753
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,800
 to keep your eyes on the flight instruments

754
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,640
 keeping the planes upright.

755
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,680
 - So it seems like vice pilots don't do this

756
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,440
 possibly Apache pilots do?

757
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,040
 - It sounds like that is exactly right.

758
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:40,880
 - Yeah.

759
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,720
 - Okay.

760
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,560
 - So it wasn't much of a fight.

761
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,280
 - No, two separate points were made.

762
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,120
 - And they both were against what you said.

763
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,520
 This was a vice pilots do.

764
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,760
 - Okay, so we're going to rename it two separate points

765
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,680
 well made.

766
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,680
 (laughing)

767
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,520
 - Your boat.

768
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,280
 (laughing)

769
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:00,080
 - Really good.

770
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:00,840
 Right.

771
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,680
 - Okay.

772
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,680
 Do you remember we talked about that Joan of Arc chapel?

773
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,160
 - Yeah.

774
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,880
 - It was, they picked it up in France

775
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,480
 and they dropped it off in Wisconsin.

776
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,720
 - That's exactly right.

777
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,240
 - A couple of emails are coming about this.

778
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,480
 Mark Lee says, "I was listening to your recent podcast

779
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,400
 about this church in Milwaukee

780
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,720
 that Joan of Arc prayed in.

781
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,360
 In a similar vein, the cottage that kept in cook

782
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,040
 of explorer fame grew up in is in Melbourne, Australia.

783
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,880
 A place he himself never visited.

784
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,000
 - I'm gonna stop you there, says Andy.

785
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 (laughing)

786
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,600
 - I'll see why I read this email up.

787
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,000
 (laughing)

788
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,960
 - We happen to know that you've been to that place.

789
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,960
 - I've been to that place.

790
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,320
 I've been to that cottage.

791
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,160
 - Yeah.

792
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,880
 - And I think it's his parents cottage.

793
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,480
 So it's a cottage that I think he never lived in.

794
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,360
 And it's a place that he never went.

795
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,200
 - Okay.

796
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,200
 - It's basically karaoke at this point.

797
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,280
 You're just the same thing that you're saying.

798
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,120
 - I've got it.

799
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:50,960
 - You tell the anecdote.

800
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,000
 - Just like to say, I got in trouble for saying

801
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,640
 that I'd been to this cottage last time.

802
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,120
 We had correspondents saying you're a bad

803
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,280
 sort of colonialist basically.

804
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,120
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

805
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,280
 - I only went because I like old stone cottages.

806
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,120
 - Yeah.

807
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:08,520
 - I'm not trying to fly the flag for Captain Cook far from.

808
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,040
 - Have you got any anecdotes you want to tell

809
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,960
 in the next episode of Drop us a Line?

810
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,240
 If we know what they are now,

811
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,800
 people could send in emails that can post you

812
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,000
 in that direction.

813
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,920
 (laughing)

814
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,160
 - Well, you know I've only got two or three.

815
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,440
 So it'll be one of the other two.

816
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,280
 - Yeah, yeah.

817
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,280
 - If you've got anything to say about

818
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,200
 the judge lays it be then doing that one.

819
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,440
 (laughing)

820
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,160
 - Oh dear.

821
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,840
 Well, Mandy Tothil, I think,

822
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,880
 sends in this fact about the Joan of Arc Chapel,

823
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,800
 which sadly, it's not as good an email

824
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:43,320
 'cause it doesn't bring me on to home turf.

825
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,440
 She says, "I was excited to hear this fact just now.

826
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,240
 The Joan of Arc Chapel is on the campus

827
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,640
 of the Jesuit University I attended, Marquette.

828
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,160
 We had a campus legend priest who performed mass

829
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,640
 every Tuesday night in the chapel for decades.

830
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,160
 He was also a professional clown."

831
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,640
 - That's great.

832
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,480
 - That's good.

833
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,400
 I was just thinking a clown priest is a good idea.

834
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,400
 - Clown priest.

835
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,240
 - You know?

836
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,080
 - Yeah.

837
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:07,920
 - Did you know?

838
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,760
 (laughing)

839
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,760
 - No, Andy's got a joke here, that one.

840
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,600
 - Oh, come on.

841
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,440
 (laughing)

842
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,280
 - I'm sorry.

843
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,160
 - Why do you think he's reading this out?

844
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,400
 - I don't know if he's read a joke

845
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,480
 that will come at me at this section.

846
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,320
 - Idiot, please.

847
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,320
 - So you hear me out, right?

848
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,640
 (laughing)

849
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,880
 - My show, my show is going to be called Hear Me Out,

850
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,320
 where I'm desperately trying to get a word in.

851
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,760
 While Dan is in the studio next door.

852
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,640
 - So I'm showing the listings, we'll have to say,

853
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,560
 not a repeat, just similar anecdotes.

854
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,120
 (laughing)

855
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,800
 I've seen this episode, I don't know.

856
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,160
 - Okay, go on, what's the joke about clowns and priests?

857
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,920
 - It's just a funny idea, a clown who's a priest.

858
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:48,520
 - Because you're taking the blood of Christ.

859
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,120
 - Oh, Squirt, Squirty Flower, in your face?

860
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:51,960
 - Yeah.

861
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,000
 - You're doing confession, there are big shoes

862
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,520
 sticking out of the booth.

863
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,520
 - That's funny.

864
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,520
 - It's funny.

865
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,160
 - Come on, guys.

866
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,240
 Don't let me die on my heart's out here.

867
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,360
 Someone come up with something classy.

868
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,200
 I tried to pivot away, and you too.

869
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,520
 And he twisted the wind for a bit.

870
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,360
 - Wow.

871
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,040
 - Wow.

872
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,360
 - That is bullshit.

873
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,880
 - That is some bullshit.

874
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,880
 (laughing)

875
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:21,400
 - I bust my ass, going through these emails,

876
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,160
 trying to find things I can talk about of the manquim.

877
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,960
 And this is the things I get.

878
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,800
 Three and a half years of grinding toil

879
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,440
 through these mad emails.

880
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,120
 - Which I love, podcast@ky.com.

881
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,320
 (laughing)

882
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,400
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

883
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,240
 - Yeah.

884
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,240
 - Thank you, Mandy.

885
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,880
 (laughing)

886
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,720
 - All right, a few more.

887
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,920
 I've been, I've got something wrong.

888
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,920
 - I'll do it.

889
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,080
 - Insigning up to do this show,

890
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,560
 and no one appreciates my anecdotes.

891
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,640
 - No, Shambeer Kant from South Africa.

892
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,000
 So his big fan of the podcast.

893
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,840
 I'm really embarrassed about this, guys.

894
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,640
 I decided to look further into Lillie Allen's

895
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,000
 crypto-mist fortune.

896
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,840
 - Oh, yeah.

897
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,680
 - So she was often hundreds of thousands

898
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,720
 of Bitcoin to do a gig.

899
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,840
 She would have been the wealthiest.

900
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,080
 She would have been Newklier armed at this point.

901
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,640
 She would have had so much money.

902
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,440
 And there's a comment in a Reddit thread

903
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,120
 that just points out that at the time we're talking about,

904
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,680
 there were only 1.6 million Bitcoin mind.

905
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,080
 And this guy Satoshi, who we think invented it,

906
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:24,160
 owned nearly a million of the 1.6 million.

907
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:28,000
 So there was only about six to 900,000 Bitcoin

908
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,320
 in circulation, not owned by Satoshi.

909
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,400
 So how could Lillie Allen be offered a third

910
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,960
 of the existing free currency?

911
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,200
 A quarter of the supply.

912
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,080
 - So it seems unlikely that it was that many.

913
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,680
 - It seems unlikely that it was that many.

914
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,760
 - Who's it come from that story?

915
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,280
 Was it Lillie Allen herself?

916
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,680
 - She tweeted and then deleted the tweet

917
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,920
 that she was offered hundreds of thousands

918
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,280
 of Bitcoin to do that gig.

919
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,200
 - Right.

920
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,760
 - And someone else pointed out plot twist,

921
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,600
 maybe Satoshi himself wanted to pay Lillie Allen

922
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,120
 a quarter of all this currency to do one gig.

923
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,120
 - Or maybe.

924
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,960
 - 'Cause no one knows who Satoshi is.

925
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,360
 - Yes, that's right.

926
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,200
 - Lillie Allen.

927
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,600
 - Lillie Allen is Satoshi.

928
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,120
 - Trying to pay herself.

929
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,680
 - Well, it's the second life.

930
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,000
 - That's the second life.

931
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,440
 - You see, this is why they signed us up to the CIA.

932
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,280
 - Absolutely.

933
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,080
 (laughing)

934
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,320
 - Yeah, the line not in the CIA now.

935
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,360
 I'm busy counting my steps at Weathers Foods

936
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,960
 and you guys are, damn, yeah, we got it.

937
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,640
 - I'm really big job for you actually.

938
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,000
 - Yes, there's a Ruttles budget.

939
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,840
 Don't worry.

940
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:31,920
 - Ah, Inspector Schreiber, you're here.

941
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,520
 - Yes, and what I've decided is that the murderer

942
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,520
 could not have been Lillie Allen

943
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:40,960
 because the toilet is two steps away from the table.

944
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,480
 There is simply no way.

945
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,240
 She could have reached it in time.

946
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:50,240
 - But then again, is this your copy of Jesse Eisenberg's play?

947
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:55,080
 - I've got to watch these films.

948
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,240
 I've got to watch them.

949
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,240
 - Got to.

950
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,240
 - Right, Dan, you got something wrong.

951
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,920
 Barry Sawtell has a get yourself off the hook.

952
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,880
 On the most recent episode, Dan made the startling claim

953
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,000
 that Paul Hogan was a rigger on the Sydney Harbour Bridge

954
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,080
 as it was being built.

955
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,720
 Given it opened in 1932, this is quite unlikely.

956
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,200
 - Oh, as they were fixing bits.

957
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,680
 - It's true that he was a rigger on the bridge

958
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,120
 just sometime after it was built.

959
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,360
 I suspect you will hear this a lot

960
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,560
 from your Australian listeners.

961
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,400
 We actually did.

962
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,240
 We actually got this one.

963
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,080
 - Oh, wow.

964
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,560
 - We had about five people, Paul Hogan,

965
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,720
 Truth is writing and saying.

966
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,400
 - I work as a rodeo clown noise and not quite enough.

967
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,800
 - I don't think it's quite clear.

968
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,760
 The fence required to be a rodeo clown.

969
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,600
 I don't think it's funny.

970
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,560
 Think about a clown though.

971
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:40,080
 - There was a priest once in Milwaukee.

972
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,480
 (laughing)

973
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:45,480
 - I believe that my photo is in the Sydney Harbour Bridge.

974
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,120
 - Ah.

975
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,280
 - Like museum.

976
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,120
 - Yeah.

977
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,320
 - The sort of like the hall of fame.

978
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,320
 Yeah, as you walked through.

979
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,560
 - Well, celebrities who visited.

980
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,400
 - Yeah, yeah.

981
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,240
 Because I did it.

982
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,720
 - I went up there when we were in Sydney

983
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:01,680
 and one of the guitar guides recognized me from fish.

984
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,400
 And I think I got it for free,

985
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,520
 which was really nice.

986
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,120
 I offered to pay, but they,

987
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,440
 - You're entrance.

988
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,640
 - They gave me the entrance for free.

989
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,800
 And then I had to do some,

990
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,120
 I think I did something to camera.

991
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,560
 And then they apparently put my picture up saying

992
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,040
 I was in the celebrity hall of fame.

993
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,880
 I don't want to go back because I feel what actually happened

994
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,280
 is it went to somewhat a bit higher up

995
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,080
 and they went, "This guy is not famous enough to go."

996
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,800
 - I was in the hall of fame.

997
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,840
 - Paul Hogan probably.

998
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,680
 (laughing)

999
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,520
 - I don't know.

1000
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,040
 - It's a very old black-and-white photo, of course,

1001
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,680
 'cause it was 1930 when you guys were working on it.

1002
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,360
 - I think it's like, yeah, it's just like,

1003
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,640
 "So let's see what to see it when you go past."

1004
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,320
 - I did see it, but I didn't recall who was in there.

1005
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,920
 - 'Cause you and I have been to another hall of fame, right?

1006
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,760
 - Yes, we have.

1007
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,920
 - In Brisbane.

1008
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,880
 - The Koala.

1009
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,200
 - The Koala Sanctuary.

1010
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,320
 - Yes, Lone Pine, Koala Sanctuary.

1011
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,720
 And there's a photo of me in James,

1012
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,360
 looking like we've just adopted a Koala.

1013
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,720
 We're both cradling in between us.

1014
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,560
 - I've seen that photo.

1015
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,880
 What that's up on there, a wall.

1016
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,200
 - I don't think so, but they have a wall.

1017
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,040
 - I don't remember Jimmy was in that.

1018
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,800
 Jimmy Carr was in that wall for sure with Koala.

1019
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,320
 - They had some properly famous people there.

1020
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:08,000
 We just had a picture taken with a Koala, and it was lovely.

1021
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,280
 - I got sent a photo the other day of us on a wall.

1022
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,960
 Now, do you remember when we released our vinyl?

1023
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,560
 We did a gig in Kingston at a record shop.

1024
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:21,200
 - Yeah, they took a, no, it was Beggar's Bankway, I think it's called.

1025
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,840
 They took a photo, Polaroid of us,

1026
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,720
 and we're still on the wall there.

1027
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,560
 - Oh, yeah.

1028
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,640
 - People actually go in and steal those

1029
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,880
 if they're people they like.

1030
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,680
 - We're the only photo on the wall, actually.

1031
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:34,480
 Big blank space around us.

1032
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,480
 - Oh, dear.

1033
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,480
 - Yeah.

1034
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,080
 - Right, guys, we've come to the end of the show.

1035
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:39,920
 Bye.

1036
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:44,120
 Right, that's it.

1037
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,520
 We'll be back in two weeks.

1038
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,400
 If there's anything that comes up for you in the meantime,

1039
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,600
 please email it to podcast@koa.com.

1040
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,960
 Dan and Andy.

1041
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,440
 - Yep, Dan and Andy.

1042
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,840
 - Yep, take it, bye.

1043
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,800
 James, anything to add?

1044
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,640
 - No.

1045
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,120
 - Right, right, see you next time.

1046
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:58,960
 Bye.

1047
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,540
 (upbeat music)

1048
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:07,040
 (upbeat music)
