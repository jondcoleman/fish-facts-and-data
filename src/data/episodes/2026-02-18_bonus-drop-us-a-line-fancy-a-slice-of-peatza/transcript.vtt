WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400
 - They don't want it, they don't want it.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.900
 (playful music)

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:11.040
 - Hi.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.560
 - Hey Andy, how's it going guys?

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.560
 - It's going well, thank you.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.400
 - How are you guys?

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.680
 - Just in a really good show with Maddie Motte.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.480
 - Yes, and that'll be out before long.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.400
 - Yeah.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.720
 - But for now, welcome to Drop us a Line.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.500
 Our audience feedback show is Drop us a Line.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.260
 - We all knew this was coming.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.100
 (laughing)

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.400
 - I knew when you sent the email the other day saying,

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.500
 "Guys, we need to do an episode of Drop us a Line."

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.620
 That's when I first knew.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.420
 - Can you please put your fingers out

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.420
 and start fabricating some emails for me to read out

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.260
 in a music way?

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.480
 (laughing)

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.560
 Thank you everyone for listening

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.300
 and for watching Drop us a Line.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.480
 The inbox is bulging.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.320
 - Beautiful.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.720
 - It's full of your fantastic correspondence,

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.200
 which has been flooding in to podcast@qiu.com.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.800
 - So Wednesday afternoon.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.640
 - Yeah.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.080
 - We're in Central London.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.040
 - Yeah, in the QI office, as we always are.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.160
 - Yeah, I'm just trying to set the scenes.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.040
 - Yeah, nice.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.080
 - This is James, I'm Dan.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.920
 - I'm Andy.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:03.760
 - Yep.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.240
 - I think the scene is set.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.240
 - Start of February, in 2026, yeah.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.240
 - AD.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.880
 (laughing)

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.600
 - I think everyone's had the context they need.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.840
 - No, that's it.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.080
 - That's it.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.160
 Let's get to the emails.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.840
 - Just a quick, fun name to start.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.680
 Thought that'd be nice.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.520
 - Okay.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.040
 - And the correspondence are...

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.360
 - Actually, he has got a great name,

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.960
 but he's written in about another person

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:27.800
 with a great name.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.120
 - Rob Shanks.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.960
 - Great name.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.800
 - Great name.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.640
 - Right.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.320
 18th century MP, Gregory Turner was a noted book collector.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.520
 And when his great uncle, Sir Gregory Page,

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.560
 died without any children,

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.040
 Gregory Turner inherited the estate,

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.600
 but he was required to take on the name.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.440
 So he became...

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.280
 - Yep.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.120
 - Beautiful.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.360
 - Sir Gregory Page Turner.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.200
 - It's good.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.040
 - That's really good.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.280
 - Who was the correspondent called?

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.400
 - Rob Shanks.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.880
 - Sense his name.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.520
 - Sense his name.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.800
 - I'm gonna rob your Shanks.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.040
 (laughing)

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.160
 - Shank is a verb in golf.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.000
 - Oh, is it?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 - The bit where the shaft hits the head is called the huzzle.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.520
 And if when you hit the ball,

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.920
 you accidentally hit the huzzle,

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.480
 the ball goes off in a weird direction

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.480
 and it's called a shank.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.800
 - That's really good.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.320
 So Rob Shanks.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.160
 Brilliant.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.000
 - Very good.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.800
 - Well, he points out, if you are a book collector

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.720
 and you then become a Gregory Page Turner,

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.680
 is this a rare case of determinative nominism?

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.520
 - Yeah.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.440
 (laughing)

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.280
 - It's good.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.120
 - Really good.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.960
 - Very strong.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:32.800
 - We're off the blocks.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.640
 - Yeah.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.480
 - Rick Romalli.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.320
 - Right.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.680
 Now don't worry, you're gonna get deja vu when I read this out.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.520
 - Okay.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.120
 - Just thought you'd want to know that Northwest,

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.360
 which is in Southeast North Carolina,

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.800
 is due east of due west.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.520
 Exactly as one would expect.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.760
 - So we did have a very similar fact a few weeks ago.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.280
 I don't think it was exactly the same.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.120
 - No.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.400
 We mentioned two places that are both in South Carolina.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.240
 Right?

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.600
 But this fact, I've written it down to explain.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.160
 We mentioned Dew West, which is in South Carolina.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.160
 - Okay.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.040
 - And it's relationship to another place in South Carolina

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.880
 called North.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.720
 - Yep.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.280
 - A North is southeast of Dew West,

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.280
 but they're both in South Carolina.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.560
 But this fact is about a place in Southeast North Carolina

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.960
 called Northwest, which is due east

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.920
 of South Carolina's Dew West.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.040
 - No questions.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.800
 - Okay, no questions.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.680
 - That's very complicated.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.640
 - I think I made it pretty clear.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.560
 - No, you did.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.720
 - It was good.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.720
 - It was very good.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.960
 - Should we have another?

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:35.960
 - Yeah.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.200
 - Caitlin Foukes.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.640
 - Yep.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.480
 - Arguably.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.320
 - Yes.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.760
 - She points out she is sort of a sentence person.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.640
 (laughing)

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.600
 - She says, "Am I disqualified due to the necessity

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.160
 for a humorous mispronunciation?"

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.000
 - Caitlin.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.840
 - Not on this show.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.680
 - Welcome.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.360
 (laughing)

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.040
 - Caitlin writes, "I was listening to the latest drop

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.800
 "as a line, and as so often happens,

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.360
 "James' face blindness was mentioned.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.400
 "I was thinking that, of course,

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.080
 "though he can't picture himself or anyone else,

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.600
 "he will know things like,

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.040
 "James has curly hair."

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.440
 - What's a terrible example?

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.160
 - That's such a bad example.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.720
 - I no longer have curly hair.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.680
 - Listeners, James no longer has curly hair.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.400
 But Danway's glasses, or Caitlin says,

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.640
 and he looks like a stickman.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.600
 Very funny Caitlin.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.920
 - Very true.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.200
 - So this naturally made I think of a cool game.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.520
 The game is Guess Who.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.520
 - My suggestion is that you make James play Guess Who,

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.880
 but entirely with the most important people of his life,

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:32.720
 in his life.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.800
 He has a picture of the person,

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.240
 and all the little tiles have names.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.560
 He spends the game trying to work out

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.120
 which of the people he loves his faces he's looking at

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.920
 using only memorized propositions about their appearance

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.040
 and yes, no questions.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.600
 - I can mostly do that in fairness

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.560
 of people I know really well, I can recognize them.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.160
 Due to the fact that I know my wife has a fringe.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.000
 - Exactly.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.840
 - I'm on there.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.840
 - James, once you said to me,

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.840
 hey, was Fonella at this very random train station

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.480
 on this day at this time?

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.880
 And I was like, I happen to know that she was.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.560
 And you recognized her from, she was in the distance.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.400
 You were with Paulina.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.360
 You recognized her from her walk as she was walking away.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.200
 - Oh, yeah.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.200
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.560
 She also had a head in the hands going,

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.640
 and that fucking damn.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.400
 (all laughing)

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.240
 - I keep telling her to stop doing that, public.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.080
 - That's too obvious.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.920
 - That's interesting.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.200
 Yeah, I can recognize people's gate quite well.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.920
 - You should work for the CIA.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:31.760
 - Should I?

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.800
 - Who's to say you don't already?

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.640
 - Uh-huh.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.440
 - Well, they do complicated things like that, don't they?

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.280
 - Do they?

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.120
 - I don't know.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.960
 - Ask him.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:39.800
 - Ask him.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.120
 (all laughing)

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.600
 - That's exactly what someone working for the CIA would say.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.440
 - Very good point.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.160
 (all laughing)

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.440
 - Seems like, I mean, one of us doesn't work for the CIA.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.800
 - I don't love the CIA.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.920
 - But it's always the one you least expect, isn't it?

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.440
 - Guys, can we just drop the pretence?

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.200
 This has been a CIA podcast for 12 years.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.040
 - Right.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.360
 - It was a thick, thick dossier about each of us

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.360
 written by the other two.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.080
 (all laughing)

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.920
 - And, of course, runs the CIA.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.520
 (all laughing)

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.640
 Tony Elmquist says, "Hi, guys, writing this in real time

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.480
 while listening to "Drop us a Line."

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.880
 "Danic Dotes."

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.400
 That's the show.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.600
 That is all.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.040
 - Just my stories.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.880
 - I think so.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:18.680
 - Right.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:19.680
 - "Danic Dotes." - Good.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.520
 - Yeah.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.760
 - I feel like that's your BBC One Primetime show,

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.840
 where you and my guests on and simply tell things about your life.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.160
 (all laughing)

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.120
 So I asked them a question, and before they answer, I say,

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.640
 "I tell you why I ask." - This is the show.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.320
 - Yeah, that's what the show's called.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.440
 - I tell you why I ask.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.680
 - No, it's called "Danic Dotes." (all laughing)

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.680
 - That's how we got here in the show. - That's how we got there.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.520
 - Okay.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.240
 - No, no, no, I'll tell you why I ask, is good.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.320
 But I think that can be your cat phrase

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.440
 within the show, "Danic Dotes."

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.080
 - Yes. - I think that's a genuinely

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.600
 a funny idea for a show.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.600
 - Okay, well, good suggestion.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:49.600
 - Good suggestion. - "Danic Dotes."

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.800
 - Good suggestion, as a show. - Thank you.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.520
 - "Jamison Davies" sends in,

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.720
 fun little bit of bonus "Bream."

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.400
 It's my new name for the extra-fact bit.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.440
 - Bonus "Bream."

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.520
 - Can you think of another fish beginning with "B"?

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.840
 - Baracuda. - Baracuda.

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.240
 - "Burnus Bass," "Burnus Baracuda."

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.680
 Yep, those are both good.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:08.680
 And maybe this format...

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.440
 (all laughing)

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.400
 Maybe this bit will evolve over the next few weeks.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.880
 - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.120
 - "Jamison" writes in.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.560
 I'm sure a lot of folks will write in about this.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.560
 I don't know how to tell you, "Jamison," you're the first.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.680
 Almost never when someone says,

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.880
 "I'm so sorry, I'm probably troughing through

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.600
 like 40,000 emails about this."

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.480
 They always are the only one who's sent to the Zen.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.280
 - Yeah. - But as a New Yorker,

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:35.000
 I have to point out the best building height related pun.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.400
 - Oh yeah. - Oh, okay, you said.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.400
 - This is to do the fact that we did a fact

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.200
 when Olga Hock was on, which was all about in Japan,

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.200
 height of its tallest tower, the sky tree.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.400
 - The sky tree is the exact same number

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.920
 as a pun of the old area it's from.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:52.920
 - Okay. - Well...

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.240
 - It was one of those in New York.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.600
 - It was one of those slap bang.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.640
 One world trade center.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.440
 - Oh yeah. - It's only one meter high.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.920
 - That's right.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.040
 But through an incredible optical illusion,

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.800
 they made it look massive.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.960
 No, formerly known as the Freedom Tower.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:11.960
 It was made to be 17, 76 feet tall.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.040
 Referencing, of course, when we declared independence

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.040
 from you lot.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.640
 - And how's it going?

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:23.400
 - Sorry. - Sorry.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:28.360
 We've got a new in real life bit.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.280
 - Great. - Okay, remind me what that is.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.440
 - We've spoken about a subject.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.240
 Someone in real life has experienced that subject.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.640
 And so they can report back on it.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:41.280
 - Well, Francis O'Donnell has been living in real life.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:42.120
 Love the show.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.560
 I listen to every podcast most more than once.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:45.800
 - Every podcast.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.320
 - Every podcast we've made.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.240
 - I think everyone we've made.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.400
 - Okay.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.720
 - Could not believe you were talking about Pete and Bogs.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.560
 - Oh yeah.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.240
 - I am one of these people who heats my house with Pete.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.480
 You're one of the two percent of people in Ireland.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.800
 - That's right. - Yeah.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.560
 - When my dad bought the land for my house in Connemara

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.080
 and I was speaking part of Ireland,

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.080
 we were given a piece of land in the bog

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.920
 that we were free to take Pete from.

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.080
 We call it turf.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.280
 My grandfather used to cut his turf by hand

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.160
 with a special long shovel.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.360
 Nowadays it's done with massive machines.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.800
 As is everything in this industrial world.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.320
 (laughing)

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.520
 - Well, not in the digital world that we live in.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.320
 - In the digital world.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.280
 - It was slightly beyond the industrial world.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.280
 Some might argue.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.120
 - We are, we are, we are, we are.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.120
 - I'm sure the people of Ireland are as well.

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.120
 (laughing)

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.360
 - No, that's not what I was, oh my God.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.200
 (laughing)

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.040
 - No, I'm the bad guy.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:42.240
 And he adds, Francis adds, just FYI,

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.640
 there is still heaps of Irish whiskey made using Pete.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.440
 In fact, I've had pizza made with Pete instead of wood

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.440
 and let me tell you, it tastes awful.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.280
 (laughing)

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.040
 - Pizza, is it spelled that way as well?

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:52.880
 - It's not.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:53.720
 - Oh, what?

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:54.720
 - It should be.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.560
 - Come on.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.560
 - I think it tastes so bad that no one known as bothered

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.560
 even using that slap obvious name.

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.560
 - Oh, that's great.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.520
 - Pizza is crying out to be made.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:11.400
 Will Taylor writes in about another of Dan's secret lives

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.640
 revealed.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:13.480
 - Okay.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.400
 - I'm a Brit living in New York.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.200
 I have been listening to your show since basically

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.480
 the beginning and I enjoy the show even more now.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.640
 I live abroad as it's a little connection with home.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:21.640
 - Oh.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.400
 - I'm sure I look a little weird giggling to myself

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.480
 while walking about town with the podcast in my ears,

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.600
 but if there's one place in the world

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.080
 where no one cares how mad you look,

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.480
 it's New York City.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.760
 (laughing)

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.520
 - This is relevant, I'm setting the scene.

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:33.360
 - Yeah.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.200
 - I normally leave out the bits,

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.880
 we will say how marvellous we are.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.320
 - What year did he write?

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.160
 - This year?

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.000
 - AD.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:39.840
 - AD.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.080
 (laughing)

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.560
 AD, so I'm just...

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.040
 - AD, just setting the scene.

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:44.880
 - Absolutely.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.840
 - I was listening to last week's show

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.120
 while walking into the office.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.960
 I nearly fell over when I walked right past Dan

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.840
 just as he was talking in my ears about fish being

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.520
 the number one comedy podcast.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.440
 A closer look revealed it was not Dan IRL,

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.080
 but an advert on the bus stop.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.400
 It turns out Dan is moonlighting

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.080
 as a D or model.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.160
 (laughing)

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.880
 - As you can see in the attached photo,

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:10.000
 it definitely is Dan, even if he tries to deny it.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:10.840
 Over to you guys.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:11.680
 - Okay.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.520
 (laughing)

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.760
 - I mean, it's just another generic.

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.320
 - Do you know what these...

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:18.480
 - It's uncanny.

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:21.760
 - I have a family WhatsApp with all the Shribers,

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.240
 the ones in Austria's, the ones that live in different countries,

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:29.360
 and there's a constant thing where it's known as Hot Dan,

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.240
 where scene Hot Dan again, it's getting a lot of work,

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.400
 and I'll always get sent things like this.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.520
 - Yeah. - Hot Dan.

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.800
 - Hot Dan is thriving.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.600
 - The specs, the hair, the frown, the beard.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.440
 - The frown.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:44.040
 (laughing)

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.960
 - It's got, it's got the frowning.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.680
 - The slightly constipated look.

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:51.080
 (laughing)

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:51.920
 - The dribble.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.400
 (laughing)

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.760
 - Yeah, it's you.

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.720
 - I do see the similarity.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:03.520
 But, I guess who this guy came up, you'd say it's Dan.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.840
 - In context, if we were on tour, in Australia,

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:11.000
 and we were just arrived at the theater in Brisbane,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.680
 and I walked through the door,

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.600
 and that person came over and said,

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.080
 "Oh, James, you're here.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.080
 "I would assume it was you."

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.160
 - Okay, I would do a show with this guy.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:20.440
 - No problem.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.280
 - I would like to.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:24.280
 - If I had a context, I think if not in context,

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.320
 I wouldn't recognise either of you, but I think...

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:29.120
 - I'd say, Dan, you're looking really well.

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.200
 You've been using that cream I gave you, whatever.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.120
 - You've got a little bit of dribble just on the side.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.480
 - No, he's cleaned off the dribble, wow.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.800
 - Dan's had his host this morning, hasn't he?

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:42.320
 - Let's do a tour where there's always a different me

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:44.360
 on stage before I come on,

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.720
 but I'm not gonna tell you guys which shows it's happening.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:50.440
 So it's like two or three times over a 12-show tour,

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:51.280
 and see if you notice it.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.600
 - Well, is that guy for the Muppets?

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.440
 (laughing)

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.080
 - Guy smiley sitting on stage.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:57.920
 - Hot Dan.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:58.760
 - Hot Dan's on stage.

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.000
 - Well, as your hot Dan's, poke us to qi.com.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.880
 Let's live and up that inbox a bit.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.440
 (laughing)

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.760
 Brilliant, so thank you, Will.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:09.600
 - Hey, I did a bit of real life this week.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.440
 - Tommy.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.320
 - Would you mind if I mention it quickly?

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.400
 - I was... - That like that?

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:14.920
 - A Danic joke.

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:15.760
 - So I was in it.

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:16.600
 - Anyway, ask.

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.600
 (laughing)

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.680
 - I went to a brilliant second-hand bookshop

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.320
 that I always go to called Michael's Books.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.440
 It's in Ramsgate.

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.280
 Absolutely love it.

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:26.560
 And I went to get my bus,

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:29.960
 and I could see in the distance the local weather spoons.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.120
 And a thing that came up in my head was,

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:35.120
 I wonder what the closest table to the toilet is.

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.120
 (laughing)

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.040
 Because we mentioned on the last drop of the line,

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:42.760
 the, as part of the top trumps cards that they make,

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:45.200
 one of the options is closest steps to the toilet.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.040
 - So is this someone in Ramsgate, sorry, Mark?

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:47.880
 - In Ramsgate.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:48.960
 - The giant one, right?

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.160
 - The giant one in Ramsgate.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.480
 - So I imagine you approached you else,

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:54.000
 the Matrix D, good evening.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.920
 Yeah, I'd like a table for one, please.

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:56.760
 - Yeah, the toilets.

00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:59.560
 - I assume all the tables will be taken in that area,

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.160
 but if you have something close.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.320
 - You slip in with 20, you say,

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.480
 there's anything you can do for me to get me close

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:06.320
 to that toilet.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.320
 - Yeah.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.640
 - So I went in, I went upstairs,

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.800
 I found the closest table to the toilets,

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.840
 sat down with my pint of ruddles, and-

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:15.680
 (laughing)

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.520
 - Oh my God, that's all I think is stealth, Mark.

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:18.600
 (laughing)

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.120
 - I should have said, we walked into this, James.

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.720
 We walked smack into it.

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:23.720
 - I didn't drink ruddles,

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:24.920
 I just had an orange juice lemonade,

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:27.440
 I'm not drinking at the moment, so it felt a shame.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.280
 - Damn, it felt a shame.

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.360
 - Sonella doesn't listen to this show,

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:31.520
 you can tell us how many pint of ruddles you had.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:34.400
 And so I sat there, and so I now know

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.720
 how many steps it takes to get there.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:37.920
 - Okay, are we gonna have a guess?

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.520
 - Yeah, why don't you have a guess?

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:43.200
 - I think it would take 70 steps.

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.040
 - 70 steps.

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:48.120
 - 'Cause they are usually a long way from the seats.

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.000
 - And Dan does walk with tiny little steps.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.200
 - I do, I do, because leaving a trailer dribble

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.520
 behind me is like a snail, like a slug.

00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.360
 - No, but I presume that if you're going to the Lou,

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:02.680
 you'll have taken down your trousers first as a precaution.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:04.640
 So naturally your steps are a bit smaller, aren't they?

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.360
 - Or we've been to the pub together before,

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:07.960
 that is exactly how I do it.

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.240
 (laughing)

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.080
 - So 70 steps, I'll say, I'll do a classic down,

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.920
 I'll say two million.

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:16.880
 - Okay, I'll say 150.

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:17.720
 - 150.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:21.640
 - So from the closest table, from the closest table,

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:22.480
 I know what's gonna happen.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:27.480
 It took me 15 steps, however, I know what the official number is

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:33.000
 because while I was ordering my lemonade and orange juice,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.160
 I discovered that you can also buy six pines of ruttles.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:40.280
 - Oh, the top Trumps cards for the weather spins.

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.120
 - Wow.

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.680
 - And so it's officially 22 steps.

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.760
 And I thought, okay, well that must be the least amount

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.320
 of steps that you can get there.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.160
 - This is amazing.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:52.040
 - Well it turns out that there's a lot of these pubs

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.960
 that two steps it requires to get to the pub.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:55.960
 - I can understand that.

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:56.800
 - Okay, well can you--

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.040
 - A lot of weather spins have an open drain

00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.520
 around the edge of the room though.

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:02.960
 - Yeah, and you can just pop over there.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:03.800
 - What makes sense?

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.480
 - I actually, as soon as I walk through the front door,

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.360
 I pull my pants down, my ankles.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:10.360
 - You've got to mark your territory.

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.400
 That's the thing.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.920
 Dan, I'm so impressed that you bought these.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:16.600
 - I wouldn't have, but the proceeds go to charity.

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:17.720
 - These aren't as--

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:18.560
 - They're very boring.

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:19.760
 - They're very boring categories.

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:20.600
 - Very boring.

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:21.440
 - These can be judged.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.880
 - One interesting thing is on the back,

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:28.000
 I said, oh, you could have different carpets on there.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.720
 In actual fact, they've got the Ramsgate weather spins.

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.560
 - Yes, your Ramsgate one, isn't it?

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.880
 - I suppose that's the flagship one.

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.520
 It's the largest in the fleet.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:37.840
 - But let me tell you one extra thing

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.320
 that happened on the way in.

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:42.320
 - As I walked in, there's a big bookcase

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.200
 of free books that get given away.

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.280
 I naturally, anywhere I walk, if there's free books,

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:47.120
 I walk up to it.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.120
 So I walk up to it and I see this book sitting there.

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:56.360
 The spoils are played by Jesse Eisenberg of Now You See Me.

00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:00.680
 So I'm now sitting upstairs with my Jesse Eisenberg book.

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:01.520
 - What is going on?

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:04.400
 - Mapping out the steps and I open up the book.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.240
 - Oh my god.

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:10.240
 - And it is a signed edition of Jesse Eisenberg.

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.600
 - And we recognize that signature

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:15.920
 from the Now You See Me signed card.

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:20.040
 - My now collection of Jesse Eisenberg signed memorabilia.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:24.320
 - Yeah, so there's something going on here.

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:25.320
 I don't know what it is.

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:28.640
 - I genuinely felt as if you had come down to Ramsgate

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.160
 and left this book in there.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.960
 - But that was the way of forcing that card

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:33.280
 into your hand.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:35.840
 - Honestly, I think it's not much for Foss

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:40.840
 to put Jesse Eisenberg book in dance local Roodle Center.

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:43.000
 - No, who's gonna pick that up?

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.920
 - That book's not seeing any other figure prints on it.

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:48.600
 - I've sat this up three years ago.

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.880
 - He's been sat in that pub.

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.200
 - Oh, a play by Jesse Eisenberg.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:57.320
 - Can't believe this didn't leap off the shelf.

00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:58.600
 That's amazing.

00:17:58.600 --> 00:17:59.960
 That's so funny.

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:02.160
 - Yeah, so a little adventure.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.000
 - Really good.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.520
 Victoria Keen has a little correction for us.

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.840
 I wonder if it's a full-harkening,

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:11.120
 but we were slightly insensitive about something.

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:11.960
 - Oh dear.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.480
 - Well, judge for yourself.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.800
 - Long time listen to here and I'm so sorry to write in.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:17.920
 I was listening to not one,

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.480
 but two recent drop-as-align episodes

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:23.520
 where the procedure to turn a breach baby,

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.280
 so where the baby is the wrong way,

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:26.840
 and it needs to be turned.

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:29.680
 It's called external cephalic version,

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:32.000
 like, you know, inversion, reversion, you know,

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.600
 turning, cephalic has in the head.

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:36.280
 - Right, okay, yeah, I got it.

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:39.680
 And externalism on the outside, yeah, right, right.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:42.920
 Was described as a massage.

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:46.560
 I felt compelled to write as it is absolutely not a massage.

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:47.560
 - That's painful as hell.

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:50.400
 I've had two breach babies turned by ECV,

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.600
 and as any person who's been through it will tell you,

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.560
 it is highly uncomfortable.

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:56.640
 They offer gas and air during the procedure.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.240
 That's how painful it is.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.320
 - Can I say I've had one massage in my life

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.360
 and I was very uncomfortable as well.

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:04.600
 - So actually, Victoria, James has his own cross-to-bear.

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:05.600
 - Yeah.

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:08.160
 - And did she go horse riding afterwards?

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.960
 - I don't think so.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:10.800
 Poor man.

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:15.640
 So, you know, she just says it was uncomfortable,

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:16.560
 but definitely worth it.

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:17.840
 She's not trying to put anyone out.

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:21.480
 Was it work brilliantly for her medical procedure, yes,

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:22.920
 but a massage, absolutely not.

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:24.600
 Apologies, Victoria.

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:25.880
 We stand corrected.

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:28.240
 - I really like that as part of that fact

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.960
 about how the baby turns around,

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.240
 is that something I always say to someone

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.080
 if they're expecting their first child,

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.000
 when they're holding the baby,

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.960
 always tap the baby's bum with a rhythm of a heartbeat

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:44.080
 because their bum will have been right next to the heartbeat

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.720
 in the final stages of the pregnancy,

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.240
 and that's where they feel most comfortable,

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.400
 like they're back in the womb.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.720
 So just a little bum, do-dum, do-dum, do-dum.

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:51.560
 - And how do you do it?

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.280
 - 'Cause I remember you doing it.

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:56.120
 - And this is medically.

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:56.960
 - Dr. Shriver.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:57.800
 - Yes.

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.800
 - Stands other bright-dive BBC show.

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:01.880
 (laughing)

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:04.600
 There's a strange man in here, tapping baby's bum.

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:08.320
 - How long does this bum tapping soothing affect last?

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:10.720
 'Cause I remember you telling it to me.

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:13.040
 - My, my mum still does it to me, Jaly.

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:15.320
 (laughing)

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:19.160
 - That's, considering she's in Sydney, that's...

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.960
 - She has a surrogate, it comes over.

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:22.800
 - She has one of those, you know, those hands

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.360
 that was invented by what she called?

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:26.200
 - Margaret Atwoods.

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.840
 - Margaret Atwoods for signing things remotely.

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:31.040
 She's got one of those for tapping thumbs.

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:32.240
 - Good Lord.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.080
 - I don't know.

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:33.920
 - Two weeks, Andy?

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:34.960
 - I don't know.

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:35.960
 - Oh, I think it lasts.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:36.800
 - Okay.

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:43.160
 - Tom writes in, "Right, we've got a fish fight."

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:44.000
 - Cool.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.160
 - And that's not the title, obviously.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:47.720
 (laughing)

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:48.920
 - What do you mean?

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:49.880
 Is this a new section?

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:50.880
 - It's a new section.

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:52.600
 - What's the theme?

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:54.680
 - We've got two people writing in saying

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:57.320
 almost completely opposite things about the same subject.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:58.160
 - Okay.

00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.160
 - Which I love.

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.000
 - Yeah.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:00.840
 - It just goes to show.

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:02.520
 - It would be a very boring world if we were all alike.

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.400
 - What about argument, Connor?

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.760
 - Can it be fished up a bit?

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.280
 - Um.

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:08.120
 - Fight.

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:08.960
 - Rao.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.680
 - Rao.

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:12.520
 - Rao, Rao.

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:13.800
 - Rao, Rao, your boat.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.280
 (laughing)

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:16.280
 - I'm writing it down.

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:20.560
 - I didn't need to write Rao three times.

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.160
 That's eating up our time, isn't it?

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:27.000
 - Okay, Rao, Rao, Rao, your boat, brilliant.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 - Tom in the blue corner against Colin Aspery

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.520
 in the red corner.

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:33.400
 Tom writes, "Loving the new episode,

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:35.280
 no such thing as de-bredsion."

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:36.840
 - Colin says, "I hate it."

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:39.120
 (laughing)

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:41.640
 (laughing)

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:47.320
 - But a minor correction to Andy's comments

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:50.560
 about fight-a-pilots in the Tokyo section.

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.400
 Do you remember I said fight-a-pilots

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.800
 can move their eyes independently?

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:55.640
 - Oh yeah.

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:58.640
 - Yes, Tom says it's a patchy helicopter crew

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.920
 who need that eye independence

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:03.000
 because the helmet they wear includes,

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.720
 I'm just gonna read this directly because it's bizarre.

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.840
 The helmet includes a molecule that tracks

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:10.440
 where the eye is looking and this molecule

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:12.520
 can be slaved to the 30 millimeter gun

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:14.840
 underneath the helicopter for targeting.

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:16.880
 This way, the gun can simply look at the target

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:20.160
 to aim the weapon, which makes things faster and easier

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.680
 than some kind of handheld system.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:22.520
 - Yeah, clever.

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:25.480
 - So you're right eye, just look at something,

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.400
 and then you fire?

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.240
 - Yeah, right.

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:28.080
 - That's nuts.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.480
 - Yeah, that's interesting.

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.400
 But what if you get it mixed up?

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.560
 - What do you mean?

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:34.320
 - What if you forget the eye?

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:35.520
 That's doing it, you know what I mean?

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:36.560
 - Both eyes are gonna be looking

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.160
 in the same direction, generally.

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.240
 - Oh, that's the point though.

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.400
 - Oh, so you got independent eyes?

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:41.720
 - I think the right eye, let's say,

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:42.960
 is the one that's wearing the molecule,

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:45.560
 which is, you know, wired up to the gun.

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:47.040
 What if you accidentally use your left eye

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.400
 and you look down at the end of the sandwich

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.320
 so then you blow up your own sandwich?

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:52.520
 - These people are very highly trained.

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:53.680
 - Time to understand that.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:55.800
 - They've cut to go through years and years and years

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:59.360
 of training, even just to fly the helicopter,

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:01.600
 let alone be in these terrible situations

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:04.080
 where you're in a dogfight against an enemy.

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:04.920
 - Yes.

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:05.920
 - You can blow you up at any second.

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:09.000
 - Probably they know which eye is which.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.640
 - And probably it's not a time for sandwiches.

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:12.480
 - No.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.360
 - Yeah, I hear you.

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:16.160
 - Okay, it sounds like you're in Colin's corner.

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.320
 (laughing)

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:19.880
 - Yeah, I hated the show as well.

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:21.480
 (laughing)

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:22.320
 - Right.

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:26.120
 - Colin, Asbury, or to give him his full title,

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:29.680
 "Major, Loki, Asbury, US Air Force."

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:30.520
 - Here we go.

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:32.200
 - What does that mean?

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.960
 Is it an is that a code name?

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:35.560
 - I think Loki is a call sign.

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:36.400
 - Oh.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.480
 - L-O-K-I, like the God of mischief though.

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:41.360
 So who knows if he's telling the truth.

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:42.880
 - That's true.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.760
 - Let's assume he is.

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:47.560
 Colin says it might seem like fighter pilots

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:48.960
 are looking at multiple things at once,

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.640
 but actually that's not quite correct.

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:53.240
 I am a fighter pilot for the US Air Force.

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:56.160
 I was stationed in England at Lake and Heath.

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:57.000
 - Yeah.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.440
 - When I happened upon the podcast,

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:01.200
 and we use what is called a composite cross check

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.600
 to keep track of all the screens and gauges and everything.

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.760
 So you need to always be watching a few things,

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:08.560
 and that's the hub where you're always looking at,

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:10.160
 and then there are other sensors and screens

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:13.080
 which are kind of out on spokes away from the hub, right?

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.000
 So your eyes never really split,

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.160
 but if I want a younger pilot to be looking at two things at once,

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.880
 I tell them to lobster eye.

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:20.720
 - Lobster eye.

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.600
 - Yeah, implying they should look at two things at once,

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:23.600
 but it's just not possible.

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.960
 So you shift your hub a little bit to a new bit of equipment,

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:31.960
 and now you need to look slightly differently

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:33.800
 to keep your eyes on the flight instruments

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:34.640
 keeping the planes upright.

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.680
 - So it seems like vice pilots don't do this

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.440
 possibly Apache pilots do?

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:40.040
 - It sounds like that is exactly right.

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:40.880
 - Yeah.

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:41.720
 - Okay.

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:42.560
 - So it wasn't much of a fight.

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:44.280
 - No, two separate points were made.

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:47.120
 - And they both were against what you said.

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.520
 This was a vice pilots do.

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:50.760
 - Okay, so we're going to rename it two separate points

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:51.680
 well made.

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:52.680
 (laughing)

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:53.520
 - Your boat.

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:56.280
 (laughing)

00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:00.080
 - Really good.

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:00.840
 Right.

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:01.680
 - Okay.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.680
 Do you remember we talked about that Joan of Arc chapel?

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:05.160
 - Yeah.

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:07.880
 - It was, they picked it up in France

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:10.480
 and they dropped it off in Wisconsin.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:11.720
 - That's exactly right.

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.240
 - A couple of emails are coming about this.

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:15.480
 Mark Lee says, "I was listening to your recent podcast

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.400
 about this church in Milwaukee

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:18.720
 that Joan of Arc prayed in.

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:21.360
 In a similar vein, the cottage that kept in cook

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:24.040
 of explorer fame grew up in is in Melbourne, Australia.

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.880
 A place he himself never visited.

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:28.000
 - I'm gonna stop you there, says Andy.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 (laughing)

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.600
 - I'll see why I read this email up.

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:33.000
 (laughing)

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.960
 - We happen to know that you've been to that place.

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:35.960
 - I've been to that place.

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:37.320
 I've been to that cottage.

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:38.160
 - Yeah.

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:39.880
 - And I think it's his parents cottage.

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:43.480
 So it's a cottage that I think he never lived in.

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.360
 And it's a place that he never went.

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:46.200
 - Okay.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:47.200
 - It's basically karaoke at this point.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.280
 You're just the same thing that you're saying.

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:50.120
 - I've got it.

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:50.960
 - You tell the anecdote.

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.000
 - Just like to say, I got in trouble for saying

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.640
 that I'd been to this cottage last time.

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:57.120
 We had correspondents saying you're a bad

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.280
 sort of colonialist basically.

00:25:58.280 --> 00:25:59.120
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:03.280
 - I only went because I like old stone cottages.

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:04.120
 - Yeah.

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:08.520
 - I'm not trying to fly the flag for Captain Cook far from.

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:11.040
 - Have you got any anecdotes you want to tell

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:12.960
 in the next episode of Drop us a Line?

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.240
 If we know what they are now,

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:16.800
 people could send in emails that can post you

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.000
 in that direction.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.920
 (laughing)

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:22.160
 - Well, you know I've only got two or three.

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:23.440
 So it'll be one of the other two.

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:24.280
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:25.280
 - If you've got anything to say about

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:27.200
 the judge lays it be then doing that one.

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:29.440
 (laughing)

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:32.160
 - Oh dear.

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:35.840
 Well, Mandy Tothil, I think,

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:37.880
 sends in this fact about the Joan of Arc Chapel,

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.800
 which sadly, it's not as good an email

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:43.320
 'cause it doesn't bring me on to home turf.

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:45.440
 She says, "I was excited to hear this fact just now.

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.240
 The Joan of Arc Chapel is on the campus

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:50.640
 of the Jesuit University I attended, Marquette.

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:54.160
 We had a campus legend priest who performed mass

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.640
 every Tuesday night in the chapel for decades.

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:59.160
 He was also a professional clown."

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:01.640
 - That's great.

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:02.480
 - That's good.

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:04.400
 I was just thinking a clown priest is a good idea.

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:05.400
 - Clown priest.

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:06.240
 - You know?

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:07.080
 - Yeah.

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:07.920
 - Did you know?

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:08.760
 (laughing)

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:09.760
 - No, Andy's got a joke here, that one.

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:10.600
 - Oh, come on.

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:11.440
 (laughing)

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.280
 - I'm sorry.

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:14.160
 - Why do you think he's reading this out?

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.400
 - I don't know if he's read a joke

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.480
 that will come at me at this section.

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:18.320
 - Idiot, please.

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:19.320
 - So you hear me out, right?

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.640
 (laughing)

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:23.880
 - My show, my show is going to be called Hear Me Out,

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:27.320
 where I'm desperately trying to get a word in.

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.760
 While Dan is in the studio next door.

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:33.640
 - So I'm showing the listings, we'll have to say,

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:36.560
 not a repeat, just similar anecdotes.

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:38.120
 (laughing)

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:39.800
 I've seen this episode, I don't know.

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:42.160
 - Okay, go on, what's the joke about clowns and priests?

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.920
 - It's just a funny idea, a clown who's a priest.

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:48.520
 - Because you're taking the blood of Christ.

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:51.120
 - Oh, Squirt, Squirty Flower, in your face?

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:51.960
 - Yeah.

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:54.000
 - You're doing confession, there are big shoes

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.520
 sticking out of the booth.

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:56.520
 - That's funny.

00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:57.520
 - It's funny.

00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:59.160
 - Come on, guys.

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:01.240
 Don't let me die on my heart's out here.

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:03.360
 Someone come up with something classy.

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:06.200
 I tried to pivot away, and you too.

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.520
 And he twisted the wind for a bit.

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:09.360
 - Wow.

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.040
 - Wow.

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:12.360
 - That is bullshit.

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:13.880
 - That is some bullshit.

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:15.880
 (laughing)

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:21.400
 - I bust my ass, going through these emails,

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:24.160
 trying to find things I can talk about of the manquim.

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:25.960
 And this is the things I get.

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:29.800
 Three and a half years of grinding toil

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:31.440
 through these mad emails.

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:33.120
 - Which I love, podcast@ky.com.

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.320
 (laughing)

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:35.400
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.240
 - Yeah.

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:37.240
 - Thank you, Mandy.

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:39.880
 (laughing)

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:40.720
 - All right, a few more.

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:42.920
 I've been, I've got something wrong.

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:43.920
 - I'll do it.

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:45.080
 - Insigning up to do this show,

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:47.560
 and no one appreciates my anecdotes.

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:50.640
 - No, Shambeer Kant from South Africa.

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:53.000
 So his big fan of the podcast.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.840
 I'm really embarrassed about this, guys.

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:56.640
 I decided to look further into Lillie Allen's

00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.000
 crypto-mist fortune.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.840
 - Oh, yeah.

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:01.680
 - So she was often hundreds of thousands

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:02.720
 of Bitcoin to do a gig.

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:03.840
 She would have been the wealthiest.

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:07.080
 She would have been Newklier armed at this point.

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.640
 She would have had so much money.

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:11.440
 And there's a comment in a Reddit thread

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:15.120
 that just points out that at the time we're talking about,

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:18.680
 there were only 1.6 million Bitcoin mind.

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:21.080
 And this guy Satoshi, who we think invented it,

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:24.160
 owned nearly a million of the 1.6 million.

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:28.000
 So there was only about six to 900,000 Bitcoin

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.320
 in circulation, not owned by Satoshi.

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:33.400
 So how could Lillie Allen be offered a third

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:35.960
 of the existing free currency?

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:37.200
 A quarter of the supply.

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.080
 - So it seems unlikely that it was that many.

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:40.680
 - It seems unlikely that it was that many.

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:41.760
 - Who's it come from that story?

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:43.280
 Was it Lillie Allen herself?

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:45.680
 - She tweeted and then deleted the tweet

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:46.920
 that she was offered hundreds of thousands

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:48.280
 of Bitcoin to do that gig.

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:49.200
 - Right.

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.760
 - And someone else pointed out plot twist,

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:53.600
 maybe Satoshi himself wanted to pay Lillie Allen

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:56.120
 a quarter of all this currency to do one gig.

00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:57.120
 - Or maybe.

00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:58.960
 - 'Cause no one knows who Satoshi is.

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.360
 - Yes, that's right.

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:01.200
 - Lillie Allen.

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.600
 - Lillie Allen is Satoshi.

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.120
 - Trying to pay herself.

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:08.680
 - Well, it's the second life.

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:11.000
 - That's the second life.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.440
 - You see, this is why they signed us up to the CIA.

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:14.280
 - Absolutely.

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:16.080
 (laughing)

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.320
 - Yeah, the line not in the CIA now.

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:20.360
 I'm busy counting my steps at Weathers Foods

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:22.960
 and you guys are, damn, yeah, we got it.

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:24.640
 - I'm really big job for you actually.

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:26.000
 - Yes, there's a Ruttles budget.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:26.840
 Don't worry.

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:31.920
 - Ah, Inspector Schreiber, you're here.

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:34.520
 - Yes, and what I've decided is that the murderer

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:36.520
 could not have been Lillie Allen

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:40.960
 because the toilet is two steps away from the table.

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:43.480
 There is simply no way.

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:45.240
 She could have reached it in time.

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:50.240
 - But then again, is this your copy of Jesse Eisenberg's play?

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:55.080
 - I've got to watch these films.

00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:56.240
 I've got to watch them.

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.240
 - Got to.

00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:59.240
 - Right, Dan, you got something wrong.

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:02.920
 Barry Sawtell has a get yourself off the hook.

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:05.880
 On the most recent episode, Dan made the startling claim

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:08.000
 that Paul Hogan was a rigger on the Sydney Harbour Bridge

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.080
 as it was being built.

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:12.720
 Given it opened in 1932, this is quite unlikely.

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:16.200
 - Oh, as they were fixing bits.

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.680
 - It's true that he was a rigger on the bridge

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:19.120
 just sometime after it was built.

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:20.360
 I suspect you will hear this a lot

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:21.560
 from your Australian listeners.

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:22.400
 We actually did.

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:23.240
 We actually got this one.

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:24.080
 - Oh, wow.

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:25.560
 - We had about five people, Paul Hogan,

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:26.720
 Truth is writing and saying.

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:29.400
 - I work as a rodeo clown noise and not quite enough.

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:30.800
 - I don't think it's quite clear.

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:33.760
 The fence required to be a rodeo clown.

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:34.600
 I don't think it's funny.

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:35.560
 Think about a clown though.

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:40.080
 - There was a priest once in Milwaukee.

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.480
 (laughing)

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:45.480
 - I believe that my photo is in the Sydney Harbour Bridge.

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:47.120
 - Ah.

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:48.280
 - Like museum.

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:49.120
 - Yeah.

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:51.320
 - The sort of like the hall of fame.

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:52.320
 Yeah, as you walked through.

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:53.560
 - Well, celebrities who visited.

00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:54.400
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:55.240
 Because I did it.

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:57.720
 - I went up there when we were in Sydney

00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:01.680
 and one of the guitar guides recognized me from fish.

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:04.400
 And I think I got it for free,

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:05.520
 which was really nice.

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:07.120
 I offered to pay, but they,

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:08.440
 - You're entrance.

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:09.640
 - They gave me the entrance for free.

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:11.800
 And then I had to do some,

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:13.120
 I think I did something to camera.

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:15.560
 And then they apparently put my picture up saying

00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:18.040
 I was in the celebrity hall of fame.

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:20.880
 I don't want to go back because I feel what actually happened

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:22.280
 is it went to somewhat a bit higher up

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:25.080
 and they went, "This guy is not famous enough to go."

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:26.800
 - I was in the hall of fame.

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:27.840
 - Paul Hogan probably.

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:28.680
 (laughing)

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:29.520
 - I don't know.

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:31.040
 - It's a very old black-and-white photo, of course,

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:32.680
 'cause it was 1930 when you guys were working on it.

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:35.360
 - I think it's like, yeah, it's just like,

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:37.640
 "So let's see what to see it when you go past."

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:40.320
 - I did see it, but I didn't recall who was in there.

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:41.920
 - 'Cause you and I have been to another hall of fame, right?

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:42.760
 - Yes, we have.

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:43.920
 - In Brisbane.

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:45.880
 - The Koala.

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:47.200
 - The Koala Sanctuary.

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:50.320
 - Yes, Lone Pine, Koala Sanctuary.

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:51.720
 And there's a photo of me in James,

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:53.360
 looking like we've just adopted a Koala.

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:54.720
 We're both cradling in between us.

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:55.560
 - I've seen that photo.

00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:56.880
 What that's up on there, a wall.

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:59.200
 - I don't think so, but they have a wall.

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:01.040
 - I don't remember Jimmy was in that.

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:03.800
 Jimmy Carr was in that wall for sure with Koala.

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:05.320
 - They had some properly famous people there.

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:08.000
 We just had a picture taken with a Koala, and it was lovely.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.280
 - I got sent a photo the other day of us on a wall.

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:12.960
 Now, do you remember when we released our vinyl?

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:16.560
 We did a gig in Kingston at a record shop.

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:21.200
 - Yeah, they took a, no, it was Beggar's Bankway, I think it's called.

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:22.840
 They took a photo, Polaroid of us,

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:24.720
 and we're still on the wall there.

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:25.560
 - Oh, yeah.

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:27.640
 - People actually go in and steal those

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:28.880
 if they're people they like.

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:30.680
 - We're the only photo on the wall, actually.

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:34.480
 Big blank space around us.

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:35.480
 - Oh, dear.

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:36.480
 - Yeah.

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:39.080
 - Right, guys, we've come to the end of the show.

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:39.920
 Bye.

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:44.120
 Right, that's it.

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:45.520
 We'll be back in two weeks.

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:47.400
 If there's anything that comes up for you in the meantime,

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:49.600
 please email it to podcast@koa.com.

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:50.960
 Dan and Andy.

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:52.440
 - Yep, Dan and Andy.

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:53.840
 - Yep, take it, bye.

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:55.800
 James, anything to add?

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:56.640
 - No.

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:58.120
 - Right, right, see you next time.

00:33:58.120 --> 00:33:58.960
 Bye.

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:01.540
 (upbeat music)

00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:07.040
