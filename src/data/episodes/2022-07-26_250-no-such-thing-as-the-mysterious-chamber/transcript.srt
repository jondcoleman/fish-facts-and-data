 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

3
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,700
 to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

4
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:27,080
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin and

5
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,440
 Anna Chazinski and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

6
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,240
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.

7
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,840
 Starting with you, Andy.

8
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:45,400
 My fact is that in 1833 the pyramid at Giza was almost dismantled by the Pasha of Egypt

9
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,000
 so that he could use the stones to build a dam.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 That's brilliant.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 That's amazing.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,200
 And why did he not do it in the end?

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,920
 He was talked out of it.

14
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:00,800
 Someone said he sure you want to destroy the most ancient site in the world.

15
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,480
 So this was in 1833 and it was when Egypt was Ottoman ruled so it wasn't a local Egyptian

16
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:12,480
 ruler exactly and he was called Muhammad Ali Pasha and he did a sort of cost benefit analysis

17
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:17,280
 or he commissioned one from a civil servant to see how much it would cost and the civil

18
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,160
 servant was a Frenchman and he thought maybe it wasn't a good idea for the pyramid

19
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:27,280
 to be destroyed and his name was Linole Louis Maurice Adolf Linole and he was really young.

20
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,240
 It was one of his first jobs but I think he you know the story goes that he thought maybe

21
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,760
 this isn't a great idea.

22
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,440
 So he came up with this cost benefit analysis which said look this is going to be quite expensive

23
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,280
 and some of the stone isn't quite right and I know it's pretty cut and I know that's

24
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,400
 really convenient obviously but maybe don't do it.

25
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,960
 They did actually take some blocks didn't they from one of the pyramids?

26
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,240
 Yeah it was one of the great pyramids wasn't it?

27
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,600
 You can see that big gash down the side of it.

28
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:57,640
 So it was the pyramid of Mencaure and it was a guy called Sultan Al Aziz Uthman and he

29
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,080
 was in the 12th century and he decided to demolish the pyramids because he thought that

30
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:06,800
 they were not according to his religion let's put it that way and they took a few stones

31
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,960
 every day and after eight months they came up just like that says just this tiny little

32
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,180
 gash on the side of the pyramid because they just realized that these things are absolutely

33
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,180
 massive.

34
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,520
 So I was looking up people visiting the pyramids and because this is about them in the

35
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:26,220
 19th century so it turns out that people have been scribbling on the pyramids for many many

36
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:32,600
 years and Flobar Gustaf Flobar, a great French writer, visited Egypt in 1850 and he was so annoyed

37
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,760
 by all the graffiti everywhere.

38
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,400
 He wrote to his uncle he said there was a huge number of imbeciles names written everywhere

39
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,720
 and then he went to Alexandria he was really excited about Alexandria and then he wrote

40
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,000
 back saying a certain Thompson of Sunderland has inscribed his name in letters six feet high

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,440
 on Pompeii's column it can be read a quarter of a mile off there is no way of seeing the

42
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,240
 column without seeing the name of Thompson this imbecil has become part of the monument

43
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,360
 and is perpetuated with it.

44
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,000
 Yeah I saw that and then I also thought well let me see if I can find out who Thompson

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,840
 from Sunderland is so I was googling for I spent quite a lot of this morning doing this

46
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,320
 actually but I tried to find people called Thompson from Sunderland around that time and what

47
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:18,120
 I reckon is there was a shipbuilder called Thompson and he started his company about 15 years

48
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,280
 before this happened and eventually became quite a big shipbuilder in Sunderland and my

49
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,680
 guess is that's the kind of person who would leave Sunderland and go to Egypt to Alexandria

50
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,960
 where this was and maybe that was an advert for Thompson of Sunderland rather than him writing

51
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,120
 his name because it's in such big writing it's six feet high it would that would make quite

52
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,280
 a lot of sense I think and also if he's a shipbuilder he's got the tools to do it probably.

53
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,240
 Yeah the Victorians when they were touristing all over it they got much more access than

54
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,800
 we did so they would be able to climb up all the time and that was actually what they did

55
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,080
 and they have picnics on top so there are lots of pictures of Victorians with the picnic

56
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,400
 tables and drinking champagne on top of Pyramid's way more fun.

57
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,080
 Well during World War II that's one of the only stories I know of my grandfather during World

58
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,900
 War II he was very young but he got into it by lying about his age and he was a post

59
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,380
 deliveryman and he used to go past the Pyramids every day on his run so he's stationed in

60
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:16,540
 Egypt and on days when there was not much post he used to go and just sit on the Pyramids

61
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,260
 and have his lunch and just watch out yeah so even then World War II I guess you know see

62
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,860
 what we're two yeah because they did the same thing in World War I the Anzacs they were

63
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,660
 there and they used to have races up the Pyramids.

64
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,180
 Yeah which are quite hard to climb it looks like little steps but obviously when you're

65
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,860
 there they're really big clubs.

66
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,660
 The first European visitors they were offered sharp objects to make their own marks by

67
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,940
 Arab Guides as in you know to write your little graffiti and stuff like that.

68
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,140
 Oh you don't get that anymore?

69
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:46,220
 Yeah that's like a Stonehenge that used to do that I think we did.

70
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,220
 Yes they did.

71
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,220
 Yeah we used to mention.

72
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,220
 You got given a picac and a twerchisel.

73
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:57,620
 Yeah not a picac and a twerchisel I went to Stonehenge at one of these times where they

74
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:02,620
 let you go before all the tourists get there and if you even look like you're slightly

75
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:07,140
 touching one of these stones they are not happy at all they're really really and even if

76
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:12,060
 you try and imagine someone was to do this try and hide behind one of the stones so that

77
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,860
 people in charge can't see you they quickly run around to make sure that you're not touching

78
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:16,860
 anything.

79
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,380
 Those druids are pretty nifty aren't they?

80
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,940
 Don't end up in druid prison.

81
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,580
 What does it they chop your hands off?

82
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,780
 Well I never touched it Anna so I wouldn't know of course.

83
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:27,780
 Of course not.

84
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:33,300
 A lot of inscriptions on the pyramids are from the Greek Roman period.

85
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:38,820
 There is one which says "I visited and I did not like anything except the sarcophagus"

86
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:44,780
 and then another one says "I cannot read the Hieroglyphs" and it's done.

87
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,780
 Exactly.

88
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:49,380
 In the article that I read which was admittedly from the Daily Mail they said that it was

89
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:53,260
 quite similar to TripAdvisor this day.

90
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:57,580
 What I find the most amazing thing actually about the pyramids is that we don't know what's

91
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,580
 inside them.

92
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,580
 Still.

93
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:03,660
 We've gone to outside of the solar system and yet still in the main pyramid in Giza we

94
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,980
 don't even know what's inside it.

95
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:09,940
 There was that discovery last year that there's a massive chamber inside it.

96
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:15,220
 There's a cavity that's 30 meters long and it's above what's called the Grand Gallery.

97
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:20,220
 So there's like two rooms chambers where they thought the king and the queen were probably

98
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,900
 kept although they were all stolen so we're not totally sure.

99
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:28,600
 And then they've just done this technique where they use the sensors at Sensei's particles

100
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,340
 called muons and see what directions they're bouncing off the pyramid in.

101
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,940
 And there's this massive chamber we don't know about and I actually think which is what

102
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:40,780
 one Egyptologist said that that's where the bodies are because they said that they put

103
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:44,240
 lots of kind of fake things in there anyway because they really wanted to do her robbers.

104
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,100
 So they said "oh yeah this is the king's chamber here" but actually I bet the king were

105
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,100
 really in there.

106
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,100
 Exactly.

107
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,780
 And the aliens were hanging out with king and queen.

108
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,700
 This new chamber that they found isn't it the case that it's so mysterious that they can't

109
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,700
 even call it a chamber.

110
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,780
 They call it the void or something like that.

111
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:05,580
 Well I think they're doing that to peak your curiosity rather than it's so mysterious.

112
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,460
 They just know that they're not allowed to call it a chamber.

113
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,460
 It's not a chamber.

114
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,660
 It doesn't fit the word.

115
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:15,060
 When I was going to read Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets I'm like "well what's

116
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,060
 a secret?

117
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,060
 It's a chamber."

118
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:20,980
 The void of Secrets.

119
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,540
 Do you know what mummy wheat is?

120
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,540
 Mummy wheat.

121
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,540
 Yeah.

122
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,540
 No.

123
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,060
 So we've covered I think before the mummy craze where in the Victorian times people had mummy

124
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:32,620
 unwrapping ceremonies and a head brass bands accompanying it and it was all very exciting

125
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:37,540
 and amazing people like mummy brown and mummy whoever or mummy petter grew.

126
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:42,580
 So mummy wheat was wheat that was grown from seeds which had allegedly been found in mummy's

127
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,620
 bandages.

128
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:50,580
 And this was a craze people got really excited about wheat that was allegedly from three thousand

129
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:55,880
 years ago growing into proper plants and though all these articles published about for example

130
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:01,300
 ancient cobs of corn because you know we've got ancient Egyptian sweet corn grain and obviously

131
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,900
 it was almost certainly not true.

132
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,900
 You don't want your food ancient most of the time do you?

133
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,500
 I can see it's kind of exciting.

134
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,620
 They also when they're mummifying people I think you learn in school they put a hook up

135
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,540
 your nose and they take your brains out and stuff.

136
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:18,900
 They also took your eyeballs out and they often replace them with various things so they replace

137
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:23,340
 your eyeballs with shells or with linen apparently or with painted onions.

138
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:28,380
 So there is the most famous fairies we've found with just painted onions instead of eyes.

139
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,380
 Cool.

140
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,380
 It was cool.

141
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,380
 It was quite fun.

142
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,380
 Like kind of a snowman or something.

143
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,380
 Yeah.

144
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,380
 What vegetable is most like an eye?

145
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,140
 They didn't have carrots for noses though did they?

146
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,140
 No we don't.

147
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,140
 No.

148
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,140
 Check it out.

149
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:46,900
 I was quickly looking into, because this is a famous monument that was almost destroyed

150
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:50,460
 if this guy's planted went forward and I was looking at other monuments that have almost

151
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,380
 been destroyed.

152
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:59,940
 So the Colosseum, that got hit by lightning in the year 217 which caused huge destruction

153
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:05,860
 and as a result they just started pillaging the actual Colosseum so two thirds of it went

154
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:09,300
 and then something was put in place to say stop this is now this we're keeping this

155
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,300
 as is.

156
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,300
 So we got to keep that.

157
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:16,500
 The Washington monument was almost destroyed even before it was fully made when all the materials

158
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,500
 were being donated.

159
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:22,100
 The Pope donated a beautiful rock to go to it, but there was a group in America.

160
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,620
 He's got so much stuff.

161
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,620
 Yeah.

162
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,620
 So generous man.

163
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,620
 Right.

164
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,620
 A humble though.

165
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,620
 A humble.

166
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,620
 I'm sorry.

167
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,620
 I'm so humble.

168
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,620
 I can only give you this nice rock.

169
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,620
 Yeah.

170
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:37,660
 It was Pope Pius the Knight and he gave a rock and they said I'm so pious.

171
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:42,860
 And it was it was a party that were known as the No Nothings and No Nothings tried to prevent

172
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,860
 it.

173
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,620
 So they yeah so what they did was they stole the rock that the Pope gave and they dumped

174
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:53,180
 it into the the Potomac River and and then eventually further down the line the No Nothings

175
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:57,500
 became the actual company that were building it and bankrupt them so that they weren't able

176
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,220
 to do it and eventually it got they you know they weren't able to stop it.

177
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:05,180
 Can I just ask is this amazing rock that the Pope gave still in the river?

178
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:09,740
 I think they got it out I think they eventually found it yeah because you're not going to

179
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:14,700
 leave a Pope's rock in a river right yeah they think they they think some people within

180
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:19,420
 it admitted to where it was and where they throw it after all the time in the river.

181
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:24,660
 There's always normal rocks around them one so beautifully it's wearing the hat.

182
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,660
 I think.

183
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:34,940
 Okay it's time for fact number two and that is my fact.

184
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:39,500
 My fact this week is that psychologist Herman Rorschach thought his test wouldn't work on

185
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,780
 teenagers as they were the same as psychopaths.

186
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:49,940
 Hmm yeah so this is the man who invented the Rorschach inkblot if you can think of any

187
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:54,940
 time you've been shown some weird inkblots that's the man who created them have a sun stage

188
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:55,940
 in our life.

189
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:00,900
 When we've had our psychological testing we've all done that right yeah and he yeah it

190
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:05,660
 was a thing that he he wasn't sure how it worked he wasn't sure if it worked but he definitely

191
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:11,340
 thought it couldn't work with teenagers because it just was they were two particularly fourteen

192
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:16,380
 year olds they were just too unpredictable and and it was just too similar in characteristics

193
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,660
 to what are the characteristics and in a fourteen year old that he thought made them similar

194
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,660
 to his like that.

195
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:24,900
 I think it's emotional turbulence and it's a crazy mixed up time and there's all sorts

196
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:30,260
 of stuff going on and yeah changing you know changing growing yeah.

197
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:34,600
 Do you guys need to have some more psychological test?

198
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,580
 Yes so I think he did think it worked but like you say he didn't know why it worked but a

199
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:45,300
 lot of the people in Germany at the time did not think it worked and they called his

200
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,300
 blobs crude.

201
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,300
 Can we go the blobs?

202
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:55,980
 This is taking me right back to my teen ages having your blobs called crude.

203
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:02,220
 He very sadly died at the age of 37 yeah which is an over 37 year old is absolutely heart

204
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:08,780
 breaking and but then it was the year after he died that they kind of got a bit of recognition

205
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:12,220
 in the community and still today I suppose we don't know if they work on it probably they

206
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,220
 don't really.

207
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:17,380
 But he didn't think they worked for detecting personality times really in the way that

208
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,900
 they are kind of sometimes used to day so we just say the raw shark test it's when you

209
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:24,460
 get a shown and inked bloat and it's sort of a mirror image because it's when papers

210
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:28,820
 have been folded over with wet ink and then you're asked what you see in it.

211
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,820
 Do you see a cow?

212
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:34,060
 Do you see someone being brutally murdered due to say a blob and he invented it.

213
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,300
 I see you have beautiful, beautiful stone at the bottom of the river.

214
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:41,500
 All right Pope get out we've got more patience to see.

215
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,500
 That's one of the results.

216
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:49,140
 If this person is the Pope, do you imagine whenever you had to get a new Pope that's

217
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,140
 what they did.

218
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:53,780
 They got this raw shark test and just waited for someone to say that.

219
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:59,300
 Nice, Christ, pointy hat, waffer, he's the Pope.

220
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,500
 But yeah he didn't think that it determined whether you were the Pope or whether you were

221
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,020
 a smart person or a horrible person whatever.

222
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:10,060
 He just thought it could diagnose schizophrenia so he was a psychiatrist and he'd just noticed

223
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:15,060
 he'd been really into these things as a kid and he noticed that schizophrenia had different

224
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,900
 responses to them from normal people so he just thought you know you could spot schizophrenia.

225
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:23,500
 Yeah he was so into them by the way that as a child when he was at school his nickname

226
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:29,020
 was inkblot not that actually as a word it was Kleck but that that was yeah so it was a

227
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:33,900
 children's game originally it's called Klexography and he got nicknamed Kleck and you just

228
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,980
 you did exactly the same thing you poured in kind of paper you folded it and then you saw

229
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:40,500
 what images you could make it's like looking at clouds or something like this.

230
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:46,220
 I didn't really get this so it's not about whether you see as Anna says a murderer or

231
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,740
 a flower in the image.

232
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:52,260
 He was really interested in what kind of things people saw so he said there were three categories

233
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:56,820
 which are form movement and color so form is whether you see a donkey or a bear or a knife

234
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:03,460
 or whatever and the movement is whether you see you know a donkey offering a man of sandwich

235
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,460
 or something or whatever.

236
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,460
 A dancing woman.

237
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:09,740
 Yeah a dancing woman is better than a donkey offering a man of sandwich but his main

238
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:15,380
 interest in all of this was whether the answer was good or poor so he basically he thought

239
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:19,540
 right I think these look like particular things and if you see something which is broadly

240
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:25,220
 moth like and you say a moth or one of another you know reasonably appropriate answer then

241
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:30,500
 you'll probably find and if not then that's maybe problematic that's a problematic indicator

242
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,500
 for your personality.

243
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:35,980
 Yeah and we should also say that it's not a case of putting in a bit of paper and then

244
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:40,500
 folding it over the blots are actually quite specific aren't they yeah so they have to

245
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,260
 look blotish because if they look deliberately crafted then people might think well there's

246
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:49,420
 a specific answer that I need to go for and but also he didn't want brush strokes so it

247
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,220
 looked like someone had painted it so quite specific.

248
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:57,020
 Yeah and what's amazing this was 1921 that he created them so they really kicked off in

249
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:02,980
 37 but they're still used to this day and it's the exact same 10 inkplots that he created

250
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:08,460
 in 1921 so even though maybe people are thinking oh we can advance this as an idea they still

251
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,740
 have not gone any further than the 10 he created.

252
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,580
 Yeah so if anyone shows you them don't say for instance television because there was no

253
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:19,100
 television then don't say iPhones because there were no iPhones you'd have to think I need

254
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:27,180
 to go for something that was around in the 1920s so like the end of the wall see the wall

255
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:33,220
 street crash and you might just see if you see an iPhone or a television they'll say this

256
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:41,780
 man is insane or prophetic yeah have you guys done it I didn't want I had done the first

257
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:46,500
 few but you didn't have the patience to do the full 10 well actually I wanted to save myself

258
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,860
 in case I need to be tested in future with a Rorschach test because they got really funny

259
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:56,580
 about people so they were published in a book in the 70s and a lot of doctors who believed

260
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,740
 in them and used them said this is going to completely screw up our results because it

261
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:04,660
 came with answers of what to say and what not to say yeah I did it today did you do it

262
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,660
 else to it?

263
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:12,660
 Christmas dinner last year did you yeah what did so what did you did it give you a percentage

264
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:17,100
 I can't remember actually but it's just like you know it's these days a lot of people use

265
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,540
 it as like a parlor game to me yeah I don't know maybe up in your household we just get

266
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:26,860
 pissed on Christmas day and eat pudding sure but I'll do the Rorschach test this Christmas

267
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:31,020
 maybe it's more fun why do it today and it gives you a sickness percentage at the end

268
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:36,620
 of how sick it thinks you are you did the BuzzFeed BuzzFeed yeah you didn't you won't believe

269
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:43,220
 blob number seven but no I got I got 66% which it says is a little worrisome well do you know

270
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,740
 how many out of the 10 were worrisome because there's a very specific way that you're supposed

271
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:53,420
 to do it yeah so the proper test is there are 10 things and if you get more than four

272
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:59,140
 images classified as worrisome then it is you might be virginos gets a frenic and

273
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:03,100
 then less than four is fine and the average is two so if you look at the grass it might be

274
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:07,180
 that if you got 66% you saw three images that were worrisome but that puts you right in

275
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:13,020
 normal right so you don't know how many you got out of 10 no it was it wasn't BuzzFeed

276
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:17,100
 it was something that was classy as that it didn't really have any kind of but you have

277
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:22,580
 a lot of viruses like yeah they tried it on their computers on robots didn't they quite

278
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:28,900
 recently they gave a load of inputs to robots robot one so one and said it was a mask

279
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:34,460
 robot two so one and said it was a pin robot three said it meant isolated a robot four said

280
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:42,100
 this is the Rorschach test imagine if you went into the psychologist obviously what do you

281
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:48,100
 see here I see the Roger test I just say that for every single answer poor old robot three

282
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:53,780
 no one's worrying about him though sounds like he needs to know good pipe so I look to some

283
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:58,580
 other psychological tests from the 20th century okay and some of them are pretty weird

284
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:04,620
 so there's the Rosensvig picture frustration study from 1978 and this is really fun so it

285
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:09,980
 gives you lots of cartoon images and it's people who are in frustrating situation all men

286
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:15,940
 by the way people in frustrating situations all men and one bubble from the other person

287
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:21,260
 who is the frustrator in all of these cartoon scenarios is already filled in and you have

288
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:26,260
 to fill in your response as the man who is being frustrated so can I it would it be like

289
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:30,220
 someone whose car is being given a ticket by a traffic warden or something like that exactly

290
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:35,100
 yeah so there's an example of someone on a train and someone a woman is saying to him here's

291
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:39,580
 the newspaper I borrowed I'm sorry the baby tore it so these are I think relatively minor

292
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:45,600
 frustrations if you punch the baby then you're fine you have to fill in the cartoon bubble

293
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,820
 so I'm about to punch that baby is that what you said yeah that would that would be a

294
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:56,800
 mark of concern I mean what page of the newspaper was it can't as long as it wasn't the

295
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:01,760
 crossword that would be pretty okay so you would write was it the crossword page you told

296
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:09,860
 if it is I'm going to punch the baby yeah all the spots pages or actually the TV review

297
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:14,260
 I wanted to read that yeah so there's that one which sounds pretty good there was the

298
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:22,900
 1942 make a picture story test this is really fun so it gives you 67 little little people

299
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:29,740
 in on paper who are cut out and there are all sorts of different people and there are humans

300
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:33,900
 and there are there are ghosts there's a superhero there's a one-legged man there's a Cocker

301
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,940
 Spaniel there's a policeman the Santa Claus there are women some women clothes some women

302
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:42,540
 naked and you have to make a scene with them and then you make up a story about the scene

303
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:47,780
 and the psychologist analyzes the scene the first thing that came into my head was you know

304
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:53,620
 remember the Benny Hill show so the naked woman is ready and then Santa Claus and the one

305
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:59,020
 like a man the Cocker Spaniel are all running after him sorry so what does that mean I think

306
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:04,420
 that means that you fell into a coma in the 70s and you haven't been able to update your memory

307
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:10,380
 ever since and personality test did get really popular around that time though it was sort

308
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:16,060
 of the 40s when the raw jack test and other stuff became a thing and the idea of a character

309
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:20,620
 making you good at your job and so in the 50s people would often get tested on their

310
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,700
 personalities when they're applying for jobs but they were looking for different stuff

311
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:30,460
 in the 50s it was that era where everyone was quite gray and the traits that people wanted

312
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:35,700
 as employers were things like being really hard working and diligent very loyal very conformist

313
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:40,220
 and in fact in the early 50s the Navy put out a handbook with the proper way to deal with

314
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:44,540
 the dissenting colleague if you're in an office or a conference or whatever and this is what

315
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:50,860
 it said so if a colleague dissents or disagrees fail to hear his objections or if you must

316
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:58,380
 hear them misunderstand them the aim is to make him feel like he belongs which seems a

317
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:02,940
 bizarre way to achieve that and then it says if he persists ask him to clarify his position

318
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:08,140
 and then ask him to clarify his clarification etc etc until our lad is so hot and bothered

319
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:12,140
 that he's worked himself into the role of conference comedian so basically ignore ignore

320
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:16,380
 ignore humiliate so the professor's Navy yeah that's the Navy this is the best way to deal with

321
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:20,540
 colleagues actually ignore ignore ignore humiliate does seem like your role of this

322
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:25,740
 podcast to the rest of us the only book I've ever read is this handbook

323
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:37,820
 okay it is time for fact number three and that is Anna my fact this week is that

324
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:44,460
 Robert Falcon Scott's dying wish was for his son to get into nature Peter Scott went on to

325
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:51,100
 found the world wildlife fund and designed its panda logo very very cool how nice is that so

326
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:57,020
 so this is when he was this is when Scott was in the south pole he was stuck in his tent he was

327
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:02,620
 100% sure he was about to die so he thought he'd write a few letters as you do and his last letter

328
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:07,340
 was to his wife so it's 1912 he's called an attempt he's managing somehow to get his hand around a

329
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:13,900
 pen and he says to his wife make sure when you're raising our son make the boy interested in nature

330
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:21,100
 and that boy was Peter Scott and yeah he founded the wwf very exciting this fact isn't it because two

331
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:26,940
 sort of seminal things polar exploration and conserving animals are connected and I had no idea

332
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:32,140
 through one generation well two generations so Robert Falcon Scott we should say he made it didn't

333
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:36,940
 he to the south pole yeah with his team but they weren't the first that they were beaten by the Norwegians

334
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:42,780
 and then on the way back they were close to a depot but they were only about 10 miles away and then

335
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:48,220
 he died and he wrote all these letters in the tent as they were dying yes and the letter says make

336
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:55,100
 the boy interested in natural history if you can it's as better than games although he was quite

337
00:22:55,100 --> 00:23:00,700
 good at games in the end because he won a bronze medal at the 1936 Berlin Olympics in the

338
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:07,260
 Oh jolly dinghy class of sailing so he was a dinghy sailor that was one of the big hitters wasn't

339
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:11,660
 yeah in the Olympics well he's the reigning bronze medalist isn't he because they never did it again

340
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:18,220
 it was the one and only time the oh dinghy got a got an outing at the Olympics so that's a cool record

341
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:24,700
 he um he's an amazing character Peter Scott never properly heard of him before but uh someone who's

342
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:29,580
 at one point I think in the UK was a household name a lot of older listeners might actually go

343
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:34,540
 yeah of course we know who he is he was on a lot of natural history TV for the BBC fact back in

344
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:40,700
 the day he was on the very first um color TV program from the natural history department um and that

345
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:46,620
 was in 1968 it was called the private life of the kingfisher and he narrated it oh I see because

346
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:51,020
 kingfishes are quite colorful because you wouldn't go for the private life of the zebra or something like

347
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:57,900
 that they deliberately chosen an animal which is quite colorful yes well just on that point um it

348
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:02,860
 is said I got told this by my friend Simon what mentioned it years and years ago on this podcast but

349
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:08,540
 supposedly one of the reasons for picking the panda as the logo for wf was the fact that it was

350
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:13,580
 black and white so printing costs when they were printing out the you know with headers would be uh

351
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:18,060
 cheaper that's clever they could have just picked something really really small like a micro

352
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:25,180
 and then it would just be a printing just one dot yeah that's true it would it's a bit less

353
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:31,980
 evocative isn't it yeah it's the dot yeah it's important though um one other thing he did he

354
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:39,340
 gave the lock nest monster a name proper scientific name he called it nest sitter ass rhombopterics

355
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:45,580
 allegedly so it could be registered as a danger which yeah I guess it is now if I'd said he'd

356
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:50,940
 given him a proper scientific name you would have jumped down my throat there and said it's not real

357
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:57,340
 um I know what you mean I think it was a joke was it or not I don't know if he was joking or not

358
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:01,420
 well you know there was that whole thing about the the name that he did give it so it was a it

359
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:05,820
 was an ancient Greek name for the monster of the nest with the diamond shaped fin and that came out

360
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:13,180
 as um sitter ass rhombopterics yes yeah and supposedly when someone looked into it they found that

361
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:20,060
 there was an anagram of monster hoax by serpita s oh well in that case it probably was a joke no

362
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:24,700
 I mean I mean at at a grabs you could you can James always is saying this you can make anagrams

363
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:28,700
 out of anything well we could say this in the recent podcast anyway we did a load of anagrams and

364
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:33,340
 people can't be very clever in anagrams yeah and fine meaning that isn't necessarily there why would

365
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:37,740
 he say it's got diamond shaped fins yeah that made it much easier for him to put monster hoax

366
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:43,020
 face of eater s yeah I don't know right now I think you believed it what he he did he did send um a

367
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:48,860
 proposal to Buckingham Palace asking if he could name Lochness monster after the queen queen Elizabeth

368
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:54,060
 the second so it was going to be called Elizabeth Nessie or something along those lines but first name

369
00:25:54,060 --> 00:26:00,540
 Elizabeth for the Lochness monster and supposedly the queen did consider it but the uh the people

370
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:06,700
 are Buckingham Palace said uh no no no no no thank you so I just say where I got this fact by the way

371
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:12,140
 it's from a new book that's just come out called what a hazard a letter is and it's sort of about all

372
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:17,740
 the letters in history that either were never sent or that were never properly received or we

373
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:22,460
 only found years later looks like a really really interesting book I've only read a bit of it and I

374
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:28,460
 got this from a review but there's another piece in it actually which is about the composer Eric Sartey

375
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:34,540
 which I really liked is kind of tragic but amusing at the same time this is so Eric Sartey had this

376
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:40,460
 six-month relationship with an artist called Susan Valadon and then she broke up with him and that was

377
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:46,620
 the end of it as far as anyone knew and then when he died 30 years later they went into his house and they

378
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:51,740
 found just thousands and thousands of letters they had written every single day to her but never sent

379
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:57,820
 love letters so he died and like he literally spent 30 years writing love letters and then he so

380
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:03,420
 they got in touch with Susan still alive like hey Eric had a thing for you and gave her all these

381
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:09,420
 letters and she immediately burned them as you would do it and was probably very delighted that

382
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:15,580
 that relationship ended where it did yes exactly yeah got out of that one in the nick of time um

383
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:21,500
 one last thing um Peter Scott just to to mention again how incredible his career was one of the other

384
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:28,060
 things he did was um during the war he designed camouflage ideas for painting on the side of ships

385
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:32,940
 so that you could camouflage a ship in the ocean and they they worked so well that two ships that

386
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:39,260
 were painted with the same camouflage crashed into each other um yeah so uh and one of them was called

387
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:46,540
 HMS Broke um so yeah not the best name to name a ship but yeah it did break you know how soldiers

388
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:51,580
 used to all dress in very bright colors and then the camouflage well you know the British armies

389
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:56,300
 the bright red uniforms in the 19th century and then that was because most battlefields were so

390
00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:01,900
 covered in smoke from guns and chaos that you couldn't it wasn't dangerous to troops to dress

391
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:06,860
 them in bright colors I didn't know right so if you had an arm a duke leading a regiment he get

392
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:10,780
 he got to kidded out and he would pick whatever color he liked basically they've like football kits

393
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:14,780
 right yeah exactly yeah and you wanted something flashy and then as the smoke started to clear from

394
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:18,300
 battlegrounds it suddenly became obvious that having everyone dressed in bright red it's probably not

395
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:23,180
 a good tactic oh wow I just wonder if there was a period where all ships were extremely bright colors

396
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:29,180
 and then suddenly thought this isn't a great idea yeah yeah about football kits they um there was

397
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:33,260
 once a football game which I don't know if you'll remember you probably won but it was the first time

398
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:39,260
 man United had won their new gray kit and then halfway through the match they realised they couldn't

399
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:43,580
 see each other because they were camouflaged against the crowd so they just kept passing to the crowd

400
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:47,660
 because they couldn't see each other so and then at half time they had to swap all their shirts back

401
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:52,620
 oh wow is it an advantage though if the other team can't see you well in American football they have

402
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:58,380
 rules that the pitch has to be a particular shade of green and that's because there was once a team

403
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:03,900
 who had a blue jerseys and they painted the entire grass blue so the other team couldn't see

404
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:12,300
 I love that idea that if in war you have a home in a way kit and you and you know you're losing

405
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:25,420
 against the invading army when they suddenly change their kit to home okay there's time for

406
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:31,500
 a final fact of the show and that is James okay my fact this week is that a traditional hangover cure

407
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:38,620
 in Mongolia is the Mongolian Mary which consists of tomato juice with a pickled sheep's eyeball

408
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:47,980
 floating inside it is it is either bit meant to be more helpful or does it they have to be combined

409
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:54,780
 so I think the traditional helpful bit is a pickled eyeball because that goes back supposedly to

410
00:29:54,780 --> 00:30:00,220
 Genghis Khan Times the tomato juice obviously doesn't because they didn't have tomatoes in those days

411
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:05,100
 but actually tomato juice I think would probably help your hangover so that probably today is the

412
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:09,820
 active ingredient although the traditional thing is the eyeball but if a load of you have a hangover

413
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:14,460
 obviously it's very labor intensive in sheep yes then you have to kill a lot of sheep you don't

414
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:22,140
 have to kill them you can just put an onion in the place of the item and I learn this from Malmo's

415
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:27,260
 disgusting food museum which I went to a couple of weeks ago and tried lots of disgusting things did

416
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:34,060
 you have the hangover I did have a hangover but I didn't have any of this actually I did have a

417
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:40,940
 hangover on that day which was very bad because I had to eat things like bulls testicles and shark

418
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:46,620
 meat marinated in urine and rotten fish and all that kind of stuff and three penis wine which that

419
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:51,180
 did help the hangover a little bit yeah because it's got alcohol in it and it's like hair of the dog

420
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:57,740
 it's like penis of the dog and off the seal and off the deer here's the thing though you went to this

421
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:02,700
 museum and traditionally museums you don't touch the exhibits but you went around eating them

422
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:09,500
 and so is this is this more a restaurant than a museum no so these days a lot of museums they are

423
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:14,860
 hands on aren't they as in you can you can kind of do little bits and pieces with the exhibits

424
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:19,260
 and in this place they have a particular tasting table at the end where you can taste all the

425
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:24,860
 things or not all the things but just a few of the things that are on display and looking me they put

426
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:30,940
 a lot of extra stuff on farming which not everyone gets to have so not everyone gets to have the

427
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:36,780
 bull testicles not everyone gets to have the rotten egg with a fetus in it you know that I managed to

428
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:41,580
 have but yeah it's a really good museum it's in Marmo they've just announced that there's a new one

429
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:47,100
 about to be opened in LA and they're hoping to go around the whole world hopefully one day soon so

430
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:51,180
 wherever you are in the world you might be able to try some of this delicious stuff it's quite

431
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:57,980
 exciting because the museum was founded by Samuel West who also founded the museum of failure

432
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:03,340
 which how often do people found more than one museum so it had things like failed Donald Trump

433
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:09,820
 games and so on but with such a success that he's had to keep it going and this is his second museum

434
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:14,140
 it's very exciting the only person I can think of is the person who founded both the natural

435
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:20,860
 history museum and the British museum yes I think you're right yeah Sloan yes I'm Sloan

436
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:26,620
 so he's in quite high you know there's just that guy and the guy who did the disgusting food museum

437
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:30,380
 yeah it's pretty good it's very funny because he talks about I've read an interview with him about

438
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:35,500
 setting up this disgusting food museum and he has to sample a lot of the stuff that they get in

439
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:40,620
 and he's just in his story just constantly vomiting it's just like I just he doesn't like it you

440
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:43,740
 know it's not as if it's like a weird fetish he really doesn't like it you can't like this stuff

441
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:48,140
 it's just not very and the only thing that was quite nice was the bull testicles that was all right

442
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:52,380
 I had durian fruit which smells disgusting but this actually tastes kind of okay

443
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:57,180
 everything else is just objectively quite disgusting what so he makes a point that a large

444
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:03,100
 part of taste is to do with your psychological take on it so if you think something's going to be

445
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:09,660
 disgusting your mind sets itself ready to vomiting so he uses the example of vegemite which is the

446
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:13,660
 first time he had vegemite he hated it and thought it was horrible then he went to Australia

447
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:18,860
 and at a party it was served on two bits of toast to slices to him and he saw children eating and he

448
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:23,740
 thought oh this must be how you neutralize the taste and he started eating it now he loves vegemite

449
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:29,260
 and vegemite is in this museum and the guy who showed me around who's this guy's corona andreus

450
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:36,220
 he said that it caused almost like a diplomatic spat with Australia because as soon as the

451
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:40,780
 Australians found out that vegemite was in this disgusting food museum they were absolutely

452
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:44,940
 you know really upset well we're really I really like idea of Sweden and Australia going to

453
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:51,580
 war with each other because it's mostly a commuter's war isn't it so you've you've shown us videos of you

454
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:58,780
 at this museum and you look like you're having a really really bad time and can I just say I had a

455
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:04,060
 really really great time yes but the thing is I just you know I'm not going to say no to anything

456
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:09,260
 I'll just do whatever you know and also he was very much peer-pressuring me and telling absolutely

457
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:14,860
 everything he was like well if I try it then you have to try it and of course he works here and has

458
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:19,740
 this stuff all the time it's not really fair but yeah I open some surf streaming which is like a

459
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:26,380
 fermented rotten fish which we once had on QI but we weren't allowed to open in the studio and

460
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:31,500
 actually according to their lease this museum they're explicitly not allowed to open any of the

461
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:36,620
 cans inside the museum so we had to go outside we had a crowd of people watching me open this

462
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:41,980
 surf streaming yeah and then you did have to recoil from it didn't you was that the one we have

463
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:47,580
 recoil it's unbelievably disgusting yeah it just smells of everything rotten that you can think of

464
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:54,220
 like you know bin juice and rotten fish and you know vomit and everything you can think of it just

465
00:34:54,220 --> 00:35:00,060
 smells and takes a bit like that great and all the tickets to the museum are printed on a sick bag

466
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:06,220
 and in the first three weeks of opening they had eleven cases of visitors vomiting after trying

467
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:11,500
 the exhibits only eleven which is not a achievement isn't it they must be looking for vomits they are

468
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:15,500
 and they say if it's just like a wretch it doesn't count or if it's spitting out it doesn't count it has

469
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:21,500
 to be an actual vomit from the stomach it for them to count it and they have one of those boards

470
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:28,140
 like blood days since last weekend. Peanuts is quite common though as a hangover cure isn't it?

471
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:36,700
 is it you sort of read about the traditional hangover cures so it's often it's often dried

472
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:41,660
 dried and shriveled I think a Sicilian traditional hangover cure is bull's penis actually so you also

473
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:47,020
 have to be a bull dry bull's penis but in Bolivia it's also a famous thing bull penis soup

474
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:50,780
 bullpizzle soup is a thing that people say they have with hangovers quite a lot they actually had a

475
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:56,620
 bull penis at this museum but I couldn't taste it but they it was like a hands-on exhibit so you're

476
00:35:56,620 --> 00:36:00,860
 allowed to touch the bull's penis. Were you impressed? Did you congratulate the bull?

477
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:06,460
 Bulls sadly never made it. Well I've been looking up at the hangover

478
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:15,660
 disgusting hangover cures so Pliny the elder are old buddy and he recommends various things so he

479
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:21,660
 mostly recommends things to stop me from getting drunk in the first place. For example roasted wild boar

480
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:29,180
 lungs will do or if you don't have a wild boar if you have the ashes of a swallow's beak and mix it

481
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:34,860
 with myr and put that in your wine that stops you getting drunk in the first place. Okay good.

482
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:41,740
 But does row in the wine doesn't it? A little bit yeah. The gladiators used to eat ash for energy.

483
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:48,780
 On ITV. No it was like they would used to take it out of the hearth and then they would mix it with

484
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:54,780
 presumably wine I guess and then that would supposedly help them after a hard day's gladiator ring.

485
00:36:54,780 --> 00:37:00,220
 As for get home after a hard day's gladiator ring darling what have you cut me for supper? I'm

486
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:04,700
 exhausted. Here's some ash. With some wine Anna. Oh it's no that's absolutely fine.

487
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:14,220
 So John of Gadsden in the 14th century had advice for if you drunk too much he said that if you're a man

488
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:18,300
 then you should wash your testicles with salt and vinegar and if you're a woman you should wash

489
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:24,700
 your breasts with salt and vinegar and- Was he a salt and vinegar salesman? He liked in the local

490
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:31,100
 chippy he'd overordered it and he said you can also eat the leaf or stalk of a cabbage with some

491
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:34,380
 sugar which doesn't like the better option he should have put it first. So these days I guess you

492
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:38,220
 could just put your testicles in a bag of salt and vinegar crisps and that'll have the same effect.

493
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,060
 Absolutely. But don't do it in Tesco's.

494
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:48,620
 Dock embryo is another thing that's eaten so this is balut. Yeah so I had that balut. Did you

495
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:56,060
 use balut as I said okay. Yeah I had that. How was that? To be honest I kind of chickened out a

496
00:37:56,060 --> 00:38:02,620
 little bit. Dock's out you mean? Dock's out I did dock out yeah and when they weren't looking I only

497
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:06,860
 took a bit of the egg part of the balut and didn't have any of the embryo part because I thought

498
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:12,540
 that was a bit beyond the pale. Oh you found your line though. Well to be honest if

499
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:17,820
 anyone was watching I probably would have done it because I am extremely bad with peer pressure.

500
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:24,220
 But yeah I did taste it. It just tasted like I've had a one hundred year egg before

501
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:28,380
 and it tastes a bit like that so it's slightly rotten though it tastes like yeah. Okay slightly

502
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:33,260
 rotten you would have thought after a hundred years that really penetrated. Yeah it tastes like

503
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:39,660
 sulfurous eggs like you know yeah sulfur thoughts. Yeah egg eggs. What were you said was there anything

504
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:46,540
 else about balut? No that was a hang of a cure that apparently works so it's stuck embryo isn't it?

505
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:50,780
 It was born alive and then you eat it in the shell. You eat it in the shell. Not shelly presumably at

506
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:56,140
 embryo stage and you eat with the bee. Can you tell the beaks there? You can tell it's there but it's

507
00:38:56,140 --> 00:39:01,900
 not crunchy I don't think and there was a Filipino lady who works at this place and she absolutely

508
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:05,660
 loves it. She's like my whole family says this is not weird. I don't understand why people think

509
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:11,500
 this is weird. The Philippines are going war on Sweden to meet them. Well they do have for instance

510
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:17,180
 Haggis. Do they? Yeah they have weirdly they have like harribose not harribose but like other

511
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:21,020
 gelatin sweets because they're like well you know this is made from gelatin from bones of animals.

512
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:24,940
 This is kind of if you think about it it's kind of weird. Yeah. It's all just it is just perspective

513
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:29,660
 isn't it? I mean they think we find weird other people eat we eat equally weird stuff. I would say so

514
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:37,580
 apart you know like urine soaked shark is objectively strange. What's the urine adding to that taste?

515
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:43,100
 Well it adds a urine-y taste to it. If you were to have that and any other food in the whole

516
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:48,700
 history of time you would know which one had been soaked in urine. Yes okay. So their rules are just

517
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:52,860
 quickly go they have three rules it has to be considered disgusting by some people around the world

518
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:57,900
 so not necessarily people eating it. It has to be genuinely eaten by people as a choice not

519
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:03,420
 through necessity. So it's not things that you can only have because you have no other food and it

520
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:08,220
 must be not a food stuff invented just for tourists. Right. Of course. Because that does happen

521
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:12,060
 sometimes of course. And on the fact that it's kind of all about perspective this sort of thing

522
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:19,420
 there was an FT journalist who went to China in 2011 and went to Shaoxing and was investigating what

523
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:23,260
 Chinese people thought of cheese brought over from Europe. Because obviously not very much cheese

524
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:28,780
 is eaten in the East, very many of them are lactose intolerant, drink milk now a bit but cheese

525
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:33,740
 not really a thing. So brought over a whole bunch of cheeses and they find that disgusting or these

526
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:38,780
 people who worked in a restaurant found it kind of gross the idea and then ate the cheeses and it

527
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:43,980
 was a lot of blue cheeses very strong blue which interestingly they thought was fine. So they thought

528
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:49,260
 that's okay and they said it was quite similar to a sort of rotting bean curd dish that they serve.

529
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:53,820
 Had that as well rotten bean curd and it does taste quite cheesy. Does it? Yeah they said it was a

530
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:58,940
 similar taste. So weirdly the only one that they all said that's absolutely disgusting is an animal

531
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:10,460
 stench that haunts your nose. Baby bell. Is it is it Primula? Yeah. The multi podcast cool

532
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:16,140
 back. It's not it's a breed. Which is very interesting to us. It obviously is quite mild

533
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:21,740
 breed but then it's just something they're not used to. I remember reading somewhere and I don't

534
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:26,220
 know where it was so I think this is true but the idea was when Europeans first went to Japan

535
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:31,500
 especially that was the one overarching thing about it was that we smelled of milk and cheese and

536
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,860
 stuff like that. Is that right? Yeah. They say that in China is what like all the time they'd be like

537
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:39,980
 oh milky boys here. It's it's a smell that eminent emanates of a white person. The kind of the

538
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:45,020
 milky bar kid is not a good thing. No it's fine it's just you can smell it. It's just a smell they all

539
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:53,580
 identify. Do you guys know there's an iron brew sausage? I'm so choked on his. I almost I just

540
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:58,780
 choked on my drink because I'm so excited. An iron brew sausage. So basically this was invented

541
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:02,380
 a few years ago by a guy who said what a great hangover cure this would be. By a genius.

542
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:06,060
 It's invented. Hang on we have had a debate at the party. No no Andy. We're the combining

543
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:11,260
 two existing things. Cats is inventing a new one. I will accept a lot of things in this podcast

544
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:15,980
 but for you to say that an iron brew sausage is not an invention that we're all culling out far.

545
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:21,500
 Okay sure. It's it's pretty simple actually but so in invention you replace all the water in

546
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:27,420
 the sausage making process with iron brew and he says it's a brilliant hangover cure. One guy said

547
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:32,220
 he felt like he'd gone to heaven after tasting it. According to the inventor of the iron brew sausage

548
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:37,260
 and I really want to try one. I do as well. If you're a people who make iron brew sausages

549
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:42,140
 do get in touch. Well advertised free. Hang on. Is it all the water involved in the process?

550
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:47,020
 As in has it grown the crops that feed the cow? Has the cow been drinking iron brew from the trough?

551
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:54,700
 It has to have rained iron brew. Has the farmer had all the water in his body replaced with iron brew?

552
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,540
 Yeah he's Scottish.

553
00:42:56,540 --> 00:43:06,940
 Okay that's it that is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening. If you'd like to get
