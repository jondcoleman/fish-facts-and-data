00:00:15,00:00:19,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:19,00:00:22,to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.
00:00:22,00:00:27,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin and"
00:00:27,00:00:31,Anna Chazinski and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite
00:00:31,00:00:36,facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.
00:00:36,00:00:37,"Starting with you, Andy."
00:00:37,00:00:45,My fact is that in 1833 the pyramid at Giza was almost dismantled by the Pasha of Egypt
00:00:45,00:00:48,so that he could use the stones to build a dam.
00:00:48,00:00:49,That's brilliant.
00:00:49,00:00:50,That's amazing.
00:00:50,00:00:52,And why did he not do it in the end?
00:00:52,00:00:53,He was talked out of it.
00:00:53,00:01:00,Someone said he sure you want to destroy the most ancient site in the world.
00:01:00,00:01:05,So this was in 1833 and it was when Egypt was Ottoman ruled so it wasn't a local Egyptian
00:01:05,00:01:12,ruler exactly and he was called Muhammad Ali Pasha and he did a sort of cost benefit analysis
00:01:12,00:01:17,or he commissioned one from a civil servant to see how much it would cost and the civil
00:01:17,00:01:22,servant was a Frenchman and he thought maybe it wasn't a good idea for the pyramid
00:01:22,00:01:27,to be destroyed and his name was Linole Louis Maurice Adolf Linole and he was really young.
00:01:27,00:01:31,It was one of his first jobs but I think he you know the story goes that he thought maybe
00:01:31,00:01:32,this isn't a great idea.
00:01:32,00:01:36,So he came up with this cost benefit analysis which said look this is going to be quite expensive
00:01:36,00:01:40,and some of the stone isn't quite right and I know it's pretty cut and I know that's
00:01:40,00:01:43,really convenient obviously but maybe don't do it.
00:01:43,00:01:45,They did actually take some blocks didn't they from one of the pyramids?
00:01:45,00:01:48,Yeah it was one of the great pyramids wasn't it?
00:01:48,00:01:50,You can see that big gash down the side of it.
00:01:50,00:01:57,So it was the pyramid of Mencaure and it was a guy called Sultan Al Aziz Uthman and he
00:01:57,00:02:01,was in the 12th century and he decided to demolish the pyramids because he thought that
00:02:01,00:02:06,they were not according to his religion let's put it that way and they took a few stones
00:02:06,00:02:11,every day and after eight months they came up just like that says just this tiny little
00:02:11,00:02:15,gash on the side of the pyramid because they just realized that these things are absolutely
00:02:15,00:02:16,massive.
00:02:16,00:02:19,So I was looking up people visiting the pyramids and because this is about them in the
00:02:19,00:02:26,19th century so it turns out that people have been scribbling on the pyramids for many many
00:02:26,00:02:32,"years and Flobar Gustaf Flobar, a great French writer, visited Egypt in 1850 and he was so annoyed"
00:02:32,00:02:34,by all the graffiti everywhere.
00:02:34,00:02:39,He wrote to his uncle he said there was a huge number of imbeciles names written everywhere
00:02:39,00:02:42,and then he went to Alexandria he was really excited about Alexandria and then he wrote
00:02:42,00:02:48,back saying a certain Thompson of Sunderland has inscribed his name in letters six feet high
00:02:48,00:02:52,on Pompeii's column it can be read a quarter of a mile off there is no way of seeing the
00:02:52,00:02:56,column without seeing the name of Thompson this imbecil has become part of the monument
00:02:56,00:02:58,and is perpetuated with it.
00:02:58,00:03:03,Yeah I saw that and then I also thought well let me see if I can find out who Thompson
00:03:03,00:03:07,from Sunderland is so I was googling for I spent quite a lot of this morning doing this
00:03:07,00:03:12,actually but I tried to find people called Thompson from Sunderland around that time and what
00:03:12,00:03:18,I reckon is there was a shipbuilder called Thompson and he started his company about 15 years
00:03:18,00:03:23,before this happened and eventually became quite a big shipbuilder in Sunderland and my
00:03:23,00:03:28,guess is that's the kind of person who would leave Sunderland and go to Egypt to Alexandria
00:03:28,00:03:34,where this was and maybe that was an advert for Thompson of Sunderland rather than him writing
00:03:34,00:03:39,his name because it's in such big writing it's six feet high it would that would make quite
00:03:39,00:03:43,a lot of sense I think and also if he's a shipbuilder he's got the tools to do it probably.
00:03:43,00:03:47,Yeah the Victorians when they were touristing all over it they got much more access than
00:03:47,00:03:50,we did so they would be able to climb up all the time and that was actually what they did
00:03:50,00:03:55,and they have picnics on top so there are lots of pictures of Victorians with the picnic
00:03:55,00:03:58,tables and drinking champagne on top of Pyramid's way more fun.
00:03:58,00:04:02,Well during World War II that's one of the only stories I know of my grandfather during World
00:04:02,00:04:07,War II he was very young but he got into it by lying about his age and he was a post
00:04:07,00:04:12,deliveryman and he used to go past the Pyramids every day on his run so he's stationed in
00:04:12,00:04:16,Egypt and on days when there was not much post he used to go and just sit on the Pyramids
00:04:16,00:04:20,and have his lunch and just watch out yeah so even then World War II I guess you know see
00:04:20,00:04:24,what we're two yeah because they did the same thing in World War I the Anzacs they were
00:04:24,00:04:27,there and they used to have races up the Pyramids.
00:04:27,00:04:31,Yeah which are quite hard to climb it looks like little steps but obviously when you're
00:04:31,00:04:32,there they're really big clubs.
00:04:32,00:04:36,The first European visitors they were offered sharp objects to make their own marks by
00:04:36,00:04:40,Arab Guides as in you know to write your little graffiti and stuff like that.
00:04:40,00:04:43,Oh you don't get that anymore?
00:04:43,00:04:46,Yeah that's like a Stonehenge that used to do that I think we did.
00:04:46,00:04:47,Yes they did.
00:04:47,00:04:48,Yeah we used to mention.
00:04:48,00:04:50,You got given a picac and a twerchisel.
00:04:50,00:04:57,Yeah not a picac and a twerchisel I went to Stonehenge at one of these times where they
00:04:57,00:05:02,let you go before all the tourists get there and if you even look like you're slightly
00:05:02,00:05:07,touching one of these stones they are not happy at all they're really really and even if
00:05:07,00:05:12,you try and imagine someone was to do this try and hide behind one of the stones so that
00:05:12,00:05:15,people in charge can't see you they quickly run around to make sure that you're not touching
00:05:15,00:05:16,anything.
00:05:16,00:05:19,Those druids are pretty nifty aren't they?
00:05:19,00:05:21,Don't end up in druid prison.
00:05:21,00:05:23,What does it they chop your hands off?
00:05:23,00:05:26,Well I never touched it Anna so I wouldn't know of course.
00:05:26,00:05:27,Of course not.
00:05:27,00:05:33,A lot of inscriptions on the pyramids are from the Greek Roman period.
00:05:33,00:05:38,"There is one which says ""I visited and I did not like anything except the sarcophagus"""
00:05:38,00:05:44,"and then another one says ""I cannot read the Hieroglyphs"" and it's done."
00:05:44,00:05:45,Exactly.
00:05:45,00:05:49,In the article that I read which was admittedly from the Daily Mail they said that it was
00:05:49,00:05:53,quite similar to TripAdvisor this day.
00:05:53,00:05:57,What I find the most amazing thing actually about the pyramids is that we don't know what's
00:05:57,00:05:58,inside them.
00:05:58,00:05:59,Still.
00:05:59,00:06:03,We've gone to outside of the solar system and yet still in the main pyramid in Giza we
00:06:03,00:06:04,don't even know what's inside it.
00:06:04,00:06:09,There was that discovery last year that there's a massive chamber inside it.
00:06:09,00:06:15,There's a cavity that's 30 meters long and it's above what's called the Grand Gallery.
00:06:15,00:06:20,So there's like two rooms chambers where they thought the king and the queen were probably
00:06:20,00:06:23,kept although they were all stolen so we're not totally sure.
00:06:23,00:06:28,And then they've just done this technique where they use the sensors at Sensei's particles
00:06:28,00:06:32,called muons and see what directions they're bouncing off the pyramid in.
00:06:32,00:06:35,And there's this massive chamber we don't know about and I actually think which is what
00:06:35,00:06:40,one Egyptologist said that that's where the bodies are because they said that they put
00:06:40,00:06:44,lots of kind of fake things in there anyway because they really wanted to do her robbers.
00:06:44,00:06:48,"So they said ""oh yeah this is the king's chamber here"" but actually I bet the king were"
00:06:48,00:06:49,really in there.
00:06:49,00:06:50,Exactly.
00:06:50,00:06:53,And the aliens were hanging out with king and queen.
00:06:53,00:06:57,This new chamber that they found isn't it the case that it's so mysterious that they can't
00:06:57,00:06:58,even call it a chamber.
00:06:58,00:07:01,They call it the void or something like that.
00:07:01,00:07:05,Well I think they're doing that to peak your curiosity rather than it's so mysterious.
00:07:05,00:07:08,They just know that they're not allowed to call it a chamber.
00:07:08,00:07:09,It's not a chamber.
00:07:09,00:07:11,It doesn't fit the word.
00:07:11,00:07:15,"When I was going to read Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets I'm like ""well what's"
00:07:15,00:07:16,a secret?
00:07:16,00:07:17,"It's a chamber."""
00:07:17,00:07:20,The void of Secrets.
00:07:20,00:07:23,Do you know what mummy wheat is?
00:07:23,00:07:24,Mummy wheat.
00:07:24,00:07:25,Yeah.
00:07:25,00:07:26,No.
00:07:26,00:07:29,So we've covered I think before the mummy craze where in the Victorian times people had mummy
00:07:29,00:07:32,unwrapping ceremonies and a head brass bands accompanying it and it was all very exciting
00:07:32,00:07:37,and amazing people like mummy brown and mummy whoever or mummy petter grew.
00:07:37,00:07:42,So mummy wheat was wheat that was grown from seeds which had allegedly been found in mummy's
00:07:42,00:07:44,bandages.
00:07:44,00:07:50,And this was a craze people got really excited about wheat that was allegedly from three thousand
00:07:50,00:07:55,years ago growing into proper plants and though all these articles published about for example
00:07:55,00:08:01,ancient cobs of corn because you know we've got ancient Egyptian sweet corn grain and obviously
00:08:01,00:08:03,it was almost certainly not true.
00:08:03,00:08:06,You don't want your food ancient most of the time do you?
00:08:06,00:08:08,I can see it's kind of exciting.
00:08:08,00:08:12,They also when they're mummifying people I think you learn in school they put a hook up
00:08:12,00:08:14,your nose and they take your brains out and stuff.
00:08:14,00:08:18,They also took your eyeballs out and they often replace them with various things so they replace
00:08:18,00:08:23,your eyeballs with shells or with linen apparently or with painted onions.
00:08:23,00:08:28,So there is the most famous fairies we've found with just painted onions instead of eyes.
00:08:28,00:08:29,Cool.
00:08:29,00:08:30,It was cool.
00:08:30,00:08:31,It was quite fun.
00:08:31,00:08:32,Like kind of a snowman or something.
00:08:32,00:08:33,Yeah.
00:08:33,00:08:34,What vegetable is most like an eye?
00:08:34,00:08:37,They didn't have carrots for noses though did they?
00:08:37,00:08:38,No we don't.
00:08:38,00:08:39,No.
00:08:39,00:08:40,Check it out.
00:08:40,00:08:46,"I was quickly looking into, because this is a famous monument that was almost destroyed"
00:08:46,00:08:50,if this guy's planted went forward and I was looking at other monuments that have almost
00:08:50,00:08:52,been destroyed.
00:08:52,00:08:59,"So the Colosseum, that got hit by lightning in the year 217 which caused huge destruction"
00:08:59,00:09:05,and as a result they just started pillaging the actual Colosseum so two thirds of it went
00:09:05,00:09:09,and then something was put in place to say stop this is now this we're keeping this
00:09:09,00:09:10,as is.
00:09:10,00:09:11,So we got to keep that.
00:09:11,00:09:16,The Washington monument was almost destroyed even before it was fully made when all the materials
00:09:16,00:09:17,were being donated.
00:09:17,00:09:22,"The Pope donated a beautiful rock to go to it, but there was a group in America."
00:09:22,00:09:23,He's got so much stuff.
00:09:23,00:09:24,Yeah.
00:09:24,00:09:26,So generous man.
00:09:26,00:09:27,Right.
00:09:27,00:09:28,A humble though.
00:09:28,00:09:29,A humble.
00:09:29,00:09:30,I'm sorry.
00:09:30,00:09:31,I'm so humble.
00:09:31,00:09:32,I can only give you this nice rock.
00:09:32,00:09:33,Yeah.
00:09:33,00:09:37,It was Pope Pius the Knight and he gave a rock and they said I'm so pious.
00:09:37,00:09:42,And it was it was a party that were known as the No Nothings and No Nothings tried to prevent
00:09:42,00:09:43,it.
00:09:43,00:09:47,So they yeah so what they did was they stole the rock that the Pope gave and they dumped
00:09:47,00:09:53,it into the the Potomac River and and then eventually further down the line the No Nothings
00:09:53,00:09:57,became the actual company that were building it and bankrupt them so that they weren't able
00:09:57,00:10:01,to do it and eventually it got they you know they weren't able to stop it.
00:10:01,00:10:05,Can I just ask is this amazing rock that the Pope gave still in the river?
00:10:05,00:10:09,I think they got it out I think they eventually found it yeah because you're not going to
00:10:09,00:10:14,leave a Pope's rock in a river right yeah they think they they think some people within
00:10:14,00:10:19,it admitted to where it was and where they throw it after all the time in the river.
00:10:19,00:10:24,There's always normal rocks around them one so beautifully it's wearing the hat.
00:10:24,00:10:25,I think.
00:10:25,00:10:34,Okay it's time for fact number two and that is my fact.
00:10:34,00:10:39,My fact this week is that psychologist Herman Rorschach thought his test wouldn't work on
00:10:39,00:10:43,teenagers as they were the same as psychopaths.
00:10:43,00:10:49,Hmm yeah so this is the man who invented the Rorschach inkblot if you can think of any
00:10:49,00:10:54,time you've been shown some weird inkblots that's the man who created them have a sun stage
00:10:54,00:10:55,in our life.
00:10:55,00:11:00,When we've had our psychological testing we've all done that right yeah and he yeah it
00:11:00,00:11:05,was a thing that he he wasn't sure how it worked he wasn't sure if it worked but he definitely
00:11:05,00:11:11,thought it couldn't work with teenagers because it just was they were two particularly fourteen
00:11:11,00:11:16,year olds they were just too unpredictable and and it was just too similar in characteristics
00:11:16,00:11:19,to what are the characteristics and in a fourteen year old that he thought made them similar
00:11:19,00:11:20,to his like that.
00:11:20,00:11:24,I think it's emotional turbulence and it's a crazy mixed up time and there's all sorts
00:11:24,00:11:30,of stuff going on and yeah changing you know changing growing yeah.
00:11:30,00:11:34,Do you guys need to have some more psychological test?
00:11:34,00:11:39,Yes so I think he did think it worked but like you say he didn't know why it worked but a
00:11:39,00:11:45,lot of the people in Germany at the time did not think it worked and they called his
00:11:45,00:11:46,blobs crude.
00:11:46,00:11:47,Can we go the blobs?
00:11:47,00:11:55,This is taking me right back to my teen ages having your blobs called crude.
00:11:55,00:12:02,He very sadly died at the age of 37 yeah which is an over 37 year old is absolutely heart
00:12:02,00:12:08,breaking and but then it was the year after he died that they kind of got a bit of recognition
00:12:08,00:12:12,in the community and still today I suppose we don't know if they work on it probably they
00:12:12,00:12:13,don't really.
00:12:13,00:12:17,But he didn't think they worked for detecting personality times really in the way that
00:12:17,00:12:20,they are kind of sometimes used to day so we just say the raw shark test it's when you
00:12:20,00:12:24,get a shown and inked bloat and it's sort of a mirror image because it's when papers
00:12:24,00:12:28,have been folded over with wet ink and then you're asked what you see in it.
00:12:28,00:12:29,Do you see a cow?
00:12:29,00:12:34,Do you see someone being brutally murdered due to say a blob and he invented it.
00:12:34,00:12:37,"I see you have beautiful, beautiful stone at the bottom of the river."
00:12:37,00:12:41,All right Pope get out we've got more patience to see.
00:12:41,00:12:42,That's one of the results.
00:12:42,00:12:49,"If this person is the Pope, do you imagine whenever you had to get a new Pope that's"
00:12:49,00:12:50,what they did.
00:12:50,00:12:53,They got this raw shark test and just waited for someone to say that.
00:12:53,00:12:59,"Nice, Christ, pointy hat, waffer, he's the Pope."
00:12:59,00:13:02,But yeah he didn't think that it determined whether you were the Pope or whether you were
00:13:02,00:13:05,a smart person or a horrible person whatever.
00:13:05,00:13:10,He just thought it could diagnose schizophrenia so he was a psychiatrist and he'd just noticed
00:13:10,00:13:15,he'd been really into these things as a kid and he noticed that schizophrenia had different
00:13:15,00:13:18,responses to them from normal people so he just thought you know you could spot schizophrenia.
00:13:18,00:13:23,Yeah he was so into them by the way that as a child when he was at school his nickname
00:13:23,00:13:29,was inkblot not that actually as a word it was Kleck but that that was yeah so it was a
00:13:29,00:13:33,children's game originally it's called Klexography and he got nicknamed Kleck and you just
00:13:33,00:13:36,you did exactly the same thing you poured in kind of paper you folded it and then you saw
00:13:36,00:13:40,what images you could make it's like looking at clouds or something like this.
00:13:40,00:13:46,I didn't really get this so it's not about whether you see as Anna says a murderer or
00:13:46,00:13:47,a flower in the image.
00:13:47,00:13:52,He was really interested in what kind of things people saw so he said there were three categories
00:13:52,00:13:56,which are form movement and color so form is whether you see a donkey or a bear or a knife
00:13:56,00:14:03,or whatever and the movement is whether you see you know a donkey offering a man of sandwich
00:14:03,00:14:04,or something or whatever.
00:14:04,00:14:05,A dancing woman.
00:14:05,00:14:09,Yeah a dancing woman is better than a donkey offering a man of sandwich but his main
00:14:09,00:14:15,interest in all of this was whether the answer was good or poor so he basically he thought
00:14:15,00:14:19,right I think these look like particular things and if you see something which is broadly
00:14:19,00:14:25,moth like and you say a moth or one of another you know reasonably appropriate answer then
00:14:25,00:14:30,you'll probably find and if not then that's maybe problematic that's a problematic indicator
00:14:30,00:14:31,for your personality.
00:14:31,00:14:35,Yeah and we should also say that it's not a case of putting in a bit of paper and then
00:14:35,00:14:40,folding it over the blots are actually quite specific aren't they yeah so they have to
00:14:40,00:14:44,look blotish because if they look deliberately crafted then people might think well there's
00:14:44,00:14:49,a specific answer that I need to go for and but also he didn't want brush strokes so it
00:14:49,00:14:52,looked like someone had painted it so quite specific.
00:14:52,00:14:57,Yeah and what's amazing this was 1921 that he created them so they really kicked off in
00:14:57,00:15:02,37 but they're still used to this day and it's the exact same 10 inkplots that he created
00:15:02,00:15:08,in 1921 so even though maybe people are thinking oh we can advance this as an idea they still
00:15:08,00:15:10,have not gone any further than the 10 he created.
00:15:10,00:15:14,Yeah so if anyone shows you them don't say for instance television because there was no
00:15:14,00:15:19,television then don't say iPhones because there were no iPhones you'd have to think I need
00:15:19,00:15:27,to go for something that was around in the 1920s so like the end of the wall see the wall
00:15:27,00:15:33,street crash and you might just see if you see an iPhone or a television they'll say this
00:15:33,00:15:41,man is insane or prophetic yeah have you guys done it I didn't want I had done the first
00:15:41,00:15:46,few but you didn't have the patience to do the full 10 well actually I wanted to save myself
00:15:46,00:15:50,in case I need to be tested in future with a Rorschach test because they got really funny
00:15:50,00:15:56,about people so they were published in a book in the 70s and a lot of doctors who believed
00:15:56,00:15:59,in them and used them said this is going to completely screw up our results because it
00:15:59,00:16:04,came with answers of what to say and what not to say yeah I did it today did you do it
00:16:04,00:16:05,else to it?
00:16:05,00:16:12,Christmas dinner last year did you yeah what did so what did you did it give you a percentage
00:16:12,00:16:17,I can't remember actually but it's just like you know it's these days a lot of people use
00:16:17,00:16:21,it as like a parlor game to me yeah I don't know maybe up in your household we just get
00:16:21,00:16:26,pissed on Christmas day and eat pudding sure but I'll do the Rorschach test this Christmas
00:16:26,00:16:31,maybe it's more fun why do it today and it gives you a sickness percentage at the end
00:16:31,00:16:36,of how sick it thinks you are you did the BuzzFeed BuzzFeed yeah you didn't you won't believe
00:16:36,00:16:43,blob number seven but no I got I got 66% which it says is a little worrisome well do you know
00:16:43,00:16:46,how many out of the 10 were worrisome because there's a very specific way that you're supposed
00:16:46,00:16:53,to do it yeah so the proper test is there are 10 things and if you get more than four
00:16:53,00:16:59,images classified as worrisome then it is you might be virginos gets a frenic and
00:16:59,00:17:03,then less than four is fine and the average is two so if you look at the grass it might be
00:17:03,00:17:07,that if you got 66% you saw three images that were worrisome but that puts you right in
00:17:07,00:17:13,normal right so you don't know how many you got out of 10 no it was it wasn't BuzzFeed
00:17:13,00:17:17,it was something that was classy as that it didn't really have any kind of but you have
00:17:17,00:17:22,a lot of viruses like yeah they tried it on their computers on robots didn't they quite
00:17:22,00:17:28,recently they gave a load of inputs to robots robot one so one and said it was a mask
00:17:28,00:17:34,robot two so one and said it was a pin robot three said it meant isolated a robot four said
00:17:34,00:17:42,this is the Rorschach test imagine if you went into the psychologist obviously what do you
00:17:42,00:17:48,see here I see the Roger test I just say that for every single answer poor old robot three
00:17:48,00:17:53,no one's worrying about him though sounds like he needs to know good pipe so I look to some
00:17:53,00:17:58,other psychological tests from the 20th century okay and some of them are pretty weird
00:17:58,00:18:04,so there's the Rosensvig picture frustration study from 1978 and this is really fun so it
00:18:04,00:18:09,gives you lots of cartoon images and it's people who are in frustrating situation all men
00:18:09,00:18:15,by the way people in frustrating situations all men and one bubble from the other person
00:18:15,00:18:21,who is the frustrator in all of these cartoon scenarios is already filled in and you have
00:18:21,00:18:26,to fill in your response as the man who is being frustrated so can I it would it be like
00:18:26,00:18:30,someone whose car is being given a ticket by a traffic warden or something like that exactly
00:18:30,00:18:35,yeah so there's an example of someone on a train and someone a woman is saying to him here's
00:18:35,00:18:39,the newspaper I borrowed I'm sorry the baby tore it so these are I think relatively minor
00:18:39,00:18:45,frustrations if you punch the baby then you're fine you have to fill in the cartoon bubble
00:18:45,00:18:49,so I'm about to punch that baby is that what you said yeah that would that would be a
00:18:49,00:18:56,mark of concern I mean what page of the newspaper was it can't as long as it wasn't the
00:18:56,00:19:01,crossword that would be pretty okay so you would write was it the crossword page you told
00:19:01,00:19:09,if it is I'm going to punch the baby yeah all the spots pages or actually the TV review
00:19:09,00:19:14,I wanted to read that yeah so there's that one which sounds pretty good there was the
00:19:14,00:19:22,1942 make a picture story test this is really fun so it gives you 67 little little people
00:19:22,00:19:29,in on paper who are cut out and there are all sorts of different people and there are humans
00:19:29,00:19:33,and there are there are ghosts there's a superhero there's a one-legged man there's a Cocker
00:19:33,00:19:37,Spaniel there's a policeman the Santa Claus there are women some women clothes some women
00:19:37,00:19:42,naked and you have to make a scene with them and then you make up a story about the scene
00:19:42,00:19:47,and the psychologist analyzes the scene the first thing that came into my head was you know
00:19:47,00:19:53,remember the Benny Hill show so the naked woman is ready and then Santa Claus and the one
00:19:53,00:19:59,like a man the Cocker Spaniel are all running after him sorry so what does that mean I think
00:19:59,00:20:04,that means that you fell into a coma in the 70s and you haven't been able to update your memory
00:20:04,00:20:10,ever since and personality test did get really popular around that time though it was sort
00:20:10,00:20:16,of the 40s when the raw jack test and other stuff became a thing and the idea of a character
00:20:16,00:20:20,making you good at your job and so in the 50s people would often get tested on their
00:20:20,00:20:23,personalities when they're applying for jobs but they were looking for different stuff
00:20:23,00:20:30,in the 50s it was that era where everyone was quite gray and the traits that people wanted
00:20:30,00:20:35,as employers were things like being really hard working and diligent very loyal very conformist
00:20:35,00:20:40,and in fact in the early 50s the Navy put out a handbook with the proper way to deal with
00:20:40,00:20:44,the dissenting colleague if you're in an office or a conference or whatever and this is what
00:20:44,00:20:50,it said so if a colleague dissents or disagrees fail to hear his objections or if you must
00:20:50,00:20:58,hear them misunderstand them the aim is to make him feel like he belongs which seems a
00:20:58,00:21:02,bizarre way to achieve that and then it says if he persists ask him to clarify his position
00:21:02,00:21:08,and then ask him to clarify his clarification etc etc until our lad is so hot and bothered
00:21:08,00:21:12,that he's worked himself into the role of conference comedian so basically ignore ignore
00:21:12,00:21:16,ignore humiliate so the professor's Navy yeah that's the Navy this is the best way to deal with
00:21:16,00:21:20,colleagues actually ignore ignore ignore humiliate does seem like your role of this
00:21:20,00:21:25,podcast to the rest of us the only book I've ever read is this handbook
00:21:25,00:21:37,okay it is time for fact number three and that is Anna my fact this week is that
00:21:37,00:21:44,Robert Falcon Scott's dying wish was for his son to get into nature Peter Scott went on to
00:21:44,00:21:51,found the world wildlife fund and designed its panda logo very very cool how nice is that so
00:21:51,00:21:57,so this is when he was this is when Scott was in the south pole he was stuck in his tent he was
00:21:57,00:22:02,100% sure he was about to die so he thought he'd write a few letters as you do and his last letter
00:22:02,00:22:07,was to his wife so it's 1912 he's called an attempt he's managing somehow to get his hand around a
00:22:07,00:22:13,pen and he says to his wife make sure when you're raising our son make the boy interested in nature
00:22:13,00:22:21,and that boy was Peter Scott and yeah he founded the wwf very exciting this fact isn't it because two
00:22:21,00:22:26,sort of seminal things polar exploration and conserving animals are connected and I had no idea
00:22:26,00:22:32,through one generation well two generations so Robert Falcon Scott we should say he made it didn't
00:22:32,00:22:36,he to the south pole yeah with his team but they weren't the first that they were beaten by the Norwegians
00:22:36,00:22:42,and then on the way back they were close to a depot but they were only about 10 miles away and then
00:22:42,00:22:48,he died and he wrote all these letters in the tent as they were dying yes and the letter says make
00:22:48,00:22:55,the boy interested in natural history if you can it's as better than games although he was quite
00:22:55,00:23:00,good at games in the end because he won a bronze medal at the 1936 Berlin Olympics in the
00:23:00,00:23:07,Oh jolly dinghy class of sailing so he was a dinghy sailor that was one of the big hitters wasn't
00:23:07,00:23:11,yeah in the Olympics well he's the reigning bronze medalist isn't he because they never did it again
00:23:11,00:23:18,it was the one and only time the oh dinghy got a got an outing at the Olympics so that's a cool record
00:23:18,00:23:24,he um he's an amazing character Peter Scott never properly heard of him before but uh someone who's
00:23:24,00:23:29,at one point I think in the UK was a household name a lot of older listeners might actually go
00:23:29,00:23:34,yeah of course we know who he is he was on a lot of natural history TV for the BBC fact back in
00:23:34,00:23:40,the day he was on the very first um color TV program from the natural history department um and that
00:23:40,00:23:46,was in 1968 it was called the private life of the kingfisher and he narrated it oh I see because
00:23:46,00:23:51,kingfishes are quite colorful because you wouldn't go for the private life of the zebra or something like
00:23:51,00:23:57,that they deliberately chosen an animal which is quite colorful yes well just on that point um it
00:23:57,00:24:02,is said I got told this by my friend Simon what mentioned it years and years ago on this podcast but
00:24:02,00:24:08,supposedly one of the reasons for picking the panda as the logo for wf was the fact that it was
00:24:08,00:24:13,black and white so printing costs when they were printing out the you know with headers would be uh
00:24:13,00:24:18,cheaper that's clever they could have just picked something really really small like a micro
00:24:18,00:24:25,and then it would just be a printing just one dot yeah that's true it would it's a bit less
00:24:25,00:24:31,evocative isn't it yeah it's the dot yeah it's important though um one other thing he did he
00:24:31,00:24:39,gave the lock nest monster a name proper scientific name he called it nest sitter ass rhombopterics
00:24:39,00:24:45,allegedly so it could be registered as a danger which yeah I guess it is now if I'd said he'd
00:24:45,00:24:50,given him a proper scientific name you would have jumped down my throat there and said it's not real
00:24:50,00:24:57,um I know what you mean I think it was a joke was it or not I don't know if he was joking or not
00:24:57,00:25:01,well you know there was that whole thing about the the name that he did give it so it was a it
00:25:01,00:25:05,was an ancient Greek name for the monster of the nest with the diamond shaped fin and that came out
00:25:05,00:25:13,as um sitter ass rhombopterics yes yeah and supposedly when someone looked into it they found that
00:25:13,00:25:20,there was an anagram of monster hoax by serpita s oh well in that case it probably was a joke no
00:25:20,00:25:24,I mean I mean at at a grabs you could you can James always is saying this you can make anagrams
00:25:24,00:25:28,out of anything well we could say this in the recent podcast anyway we did a load of anagrams and
00:25:28,00:25:33,people can't be very clever in anagrams yeah and fine meaning that isn't necessarily there why would
00:25:33,00:25:37,he say it's got diamond shaped fins yeah that made it much easier for him to put monster hoax
00:25:37,00:25:43,face of eater s yeah I don't know right now I think you believed it what he he did he did send um a
00:25:43,00:25:48,proposal to Buckingham Palace asking if he could name Lochness monster after the queen queen Elizabeth
00:25:48,00:25:54,the second so it was going to be called Elizabeth Nessie or something along those lines but first name
00:25:54,00:26:00,Elizabeth for the Lochness monster and supposedly the queen did consider it but the uh the people
00:26:00,00:26:06,are Buckingham Palace said uh no no no no no thank you so I just say where I got this fact by the way
00:26:06,00:26:12,it's from a new book that's just come out called what a hazard a letter is and it's sort of about all
00:26:12,00:26:17,the letters in history that either were never sent or that were never properly received or we
00:26:17,00:26:22,only found years later looks like a really really interesting book I've only read a bit of it and I
00:26:22,00:26:28,got this from a review but there's another piece in it actually which is about the composer Eric Sartey
00:26:28,00:26:34,which I really liked is kind of tragic but amusing at the same time this is so Eric Sartey had this
00:26:34,00:26:40,six-month relationship with an artist called Susan Valadon and then she broke up with him and that was
00:26:40,00:26:46,the end of it as far as anyone knew and then when he died 30 years later they went into his house and they
00:26:46,00:26:51,found just thousands and thousands of letters they had written every single day to her but never sent
00:26:51,00:26:57,love letters so he died and like he literally spent 30 years writing love letters and then he so
00:26:57,00:27:03,they got in touch with Susan still alive like hey Eric had a thing for you and gave her all these
00:27:03,00:27:09,letters and she immediately burned them as you would do it and was probably very delighted that
00:27:09,00:27:15,that relationship ended where it did yes exactly yeah got out of that one in the nick of time um
00:27:15,00:27:21,one last thing um Peter Scott just to to mention again how incredible his career was one of the other
00:27:21,00:27:28,things he did was um during the war he designed camouflage ideas for painting on the side of ships
00:27:28,00:27:32,so that you could camouflage a ship in the ocean and they they worked so well that two ships that
00:27:32,00:27:39,were painted with the same camouflage crashed into each other um yeah so uh and one of them was called
00:27:39,00:27:46,HMS Broke um so yeah not the best name to name a ship but yeah it did break you know how soldiers
00:27:46,00:27:51,used to all dress in very bright colors and then the camouflage well you know the British armies
00:27:51,00:27:56,the bright red uniforms in the 19th century and then that was because most battlefields were so
00:27:56,00:28:01,covered in smoke from guns and chaos that you couldn't it wasn't dangerous to troops to dress
00:28:01,00:28:06,them in bright colors I didn't know right so if you had an arm a duke leading a regiment he get
00:28:06,00:28:10,he got to kidded out and he would pick whatever color he liked basically they've like football kits
00:28:10,00:28:14,right yeah exactly yeah and you wanted something flashy and then as the smoke started to clear from
00:28:14,00:28:18,battlegrounds it suddenly became obvious that having everyone dressed in bright red it's probably not
00:28:18,00:28:23,a good tactic oh wow I just wonder if there was a period where all ships were extremely bright colors
00:28:23,00:28:29,and then suddenly thought this isn't a great idea yeah yeah about football kits they um there was
00:28:29,00:28:33,once a football game which I don't know if you'll remember you probably won but it was the first time
00:28:33,00:28:39,man United had won their new gray kit and then halfway through the match they realised they couldn't
00:28:39,00:28:43,see each other because they were camouflaged against the crowd so they just kept passing to the crowd
00:28:43,00:28:47,because they couldn't see each other so and then at half time they had to swap all their shirts back
00:28:47,00:28:52,oh wow is it an advantage though if the other team can't see you well in American football they have
00:28:52,00:28:58,rules that the pitch has to be a particular shade of green and that's because there was once a team
00:28:58,00:29:03,who had a blue jerseys and they painted the entire grass blue so the other team couldn't see
00:29:03,00:29:12,I love that idea that if in war you have a home in a way kit and you and you know you're losing
00:29:12,00:29:25,against the invading army when they suddenly change their kit to home okay there's time for
00:29:25,00:29:31,a final fact of the show and that is James okay my fact this week is that a traditional hangover cure
00:29:31,00:29:38,in Mongolia is the Mongolian Mary which consists of tomato juice with a pickled sheep's eyeball
00:29:38,00:29:47,floating inside it is it is either bit meant to be more helpful or does it they have to be combined
00:29:47,00:29:54,so I think the traditional helpful bit is a pickled eyeball because that goes back supposedly to
00:29:54,00:30:00,Genghis Khan Times the tomato juice obviously doesn't because they didn't have tomatoes in those days
00:30:00,00:30:05,but actually tomato juice I think would probably help your hangover so that probably today is the
00:30:05,00:30:09,active ingredient although the traditional thing is the eyeball but if a load of you have a hangover
00:30:09,00:30:14,obviously it's very labor intensive in sheep yes then you have to kill a lot of sheep you don't
00:30:14,00:30:22,have to kill them you can just put an onion in the place of the item and I learn this from Malmo's
00:30:22,00:30:27,disgusting food museum which I went to a couple of weeks ago and tried lots of disgusting things did
00:30:27,00:30:34,you have the hangover I did have a hangover but I didn't have any of this actually I did have a
00:30:34,00:30:40,hangover on that day which was very bad because I had to eat things like bulls testicles and shark
00:30:40,00:30:46,meat marinated in urine and rotten fish and all that kind of stuff and three penis wine which that
00:30:46,00:30:51,did help the hangover a little bit yeah because it's got alcohol in it and it's like hair of the dog
00:30:51,00:30:57,it's like penis of the dog and off the seal and off the deer here's the thing though you went to this
00:30:57,00:31:02,museum and traditionally museums you don't touch the exhibits but you went around eating them
00:31:02,00:31:09,and so is this is this more a restaurant than a museum no so these days a lot of museums they are
00:31:09,00:31:14,hands on aren't they as in you can you can kind of do little bits and pieces with the exhibits
00:31:14,00:31:19,and in this place they have a particular tasting table at the end where you can taste all the
00:31:19,00:31:24,things or not all the things but just a few of the things that are on display and looking me they put
00:31:24,00:31:30,a lot of extra stuff on farming which not everyone gets to have so not everyone gets to have the
00:31:30,00:31:36,bull testicles not everyone gets to have the rotten egg with a fetus in it you know that I managed to
00:31:36,00:31:41,have but yeah it's a really good museum it's in Marmo they've just announced that there's a new one
00:31:41,00:31:47,about to be opened in LA and they're hoping to go around the whole world hopefully one day soon so
00:31:47,00:31:51,wherever you are in the world you might be able to try some of this delicious stuff it's quite
00:31:51,00:31:57,exciting because the museum was founded by Samuel West who also founded the museum of failure
00:31:57,00:32:03,which how often do people found more than one museum so it had things like failed Donald Trump
00:32:03,00:32:09,games and so on but with such a success that he's had to keep it going and this is his second museum
00:32:09,00:32:14,it's very exciting the only person I can think of is the person who founded both the natural
00:32:14,00:32:20,history museum and the British museum yes I think you're right yeah Sloan yes I'm Sloan
00:32:20,00:32:26,so he's in quite high you know there's just that guy and the guy who did the disgusting food museum
00:32:26,00:32:30,yeah it's pretty good it's very funny because he talks about I've read an interview with him about
00:32:30,00:32:35,setting up this disgusting food museum and he has to sample a lot of the stuff that they get in
00:32:35,00:32:40,and he's just in his story just constantly vomiting it's just like I just he doesn't like it you
00:32:40,00:32:43,know it's not as if it's like a weird fetish he really doesn't like it you can't like this stuff
00:32:43,00:32:48,it's just not very and the only thing that was quite nice was the bull testicles that was all right
00:32:48,00:32:52,I had durian fruit which smells disgusting but this actually tastes kind of okay
00:32:52,00:32:57,everything else is just objectively quite disgusting what so he makes a point that a large
00:32:57,00:33:03,part of taste is to do with your psychological take on it so if you think something's going to be
00:33:03,00:33:09,disgusting your mind sets itself ready to vomiting so he uses the example of vegemite which is the
00:33:09,00:33:13,first time he had vegemite he hated it and thought it was horrible then he went to Australia
00:33:13,00:33:18,and at a party it was served on two bits of toast to slices to him and he saw children eating and he
00:33:18,00:33:23,thought oh this must be how you neutralize the taste and he started eating it now he loves vegemite
00:33:23,00:33:29,and vegemite is in this museum and the guy who showed me around who's this guy's corona andreus
00:33:29,00:33:36,he said that it caused almost like a diplomatic spat with Australia because as soon as the
00:33:36,00:33:40,Australians found out that vegemite was in this disgusting food museum they were absolutely
00:33:40,00:33:44,you know really upset well we're really I really like idea of Sweden and Australia going to
00:33:44,00:33:51,war with each other because it's mostly a commuter's war isn't it so you've you've shown us videos of you
00:33:51,00:33:58,at this museum and you look like you're having a really really bad time and can I just say I had a
00:33:58,00:34:04,really really great time yes but the thing is I just you know I'm not going to say no to anything
00:34:04,00:34:09,I'll just do whatever you know and also he was very much peer-pressuring me and telling absolutely
00:34:09,00:34:14,everything he was like well if I try it then you have to try it and of course he works here and has
00:34:14,00:34:19,this stuff all the time it's not really fair but yeah I open some surf streaming which is like a
00:34:19,00:34:26,fermented rotten fish which we once had on QI but we weren't allowed to open in the studio and
00:34:26,00:34:31,actually according to their lease this museum they're explicitly not allowed to open any of the
00:34:31,00:34:36,cans inside the museum so we had to go outside we had a crowd of people watching me open this
00:34:37,00:34:41,surf streaming yeah and then you did have to recoil from it didn't you was that the one we have
00:34:41,00:34:47,recoil it's unbelievably disgusting yeah it just smells of everything rotten that you can think of
00:34:47,00:34:54,like you know bin juice and rotten fish and you know vomit and everything you can think of it just
00:34:54,00:35:00,smells and takes a bit like that great and all the tickets to the museum are printed on a sick bag
00:35:00,00:35:06,and in the first three weeks of opening they had eleven cases of visitors vomiting after trying
00:35:06,00:35:11,the exhibits only eleven which is not a achievement isn't it they must be looking for vomits they are
00:35:11,00:35:15,and they say if it's just like a wretch it doesn't count or if it's spitting out it doesn't count it has
00:35:15,00:35:21,to be an actual vomit from the stomach it for them to count it and they have one of those boards
00:35:21,00:35:28,like blood days since last weekend. Peanuts is quite common though as a hangover cure isn't it?
00:35:28,00:35:36,is it you sort of read about the traditional hangover cures so it's often it's often dried
00:35:36,00:35:41,dried and shriveled I think a Sicilian traditional hangover cure is bull's penis actually so you also
00:35:41,00:35:47,have to be a bull dry bull's penis but in Bolivia it's also a famous thing bull penis soup
00:35:47,00:35:50,bullpizzle soup is a thing that people say they have with hangovers quite a lot they actually had a
00:35:50,00:35:56,bull penis at this museum but I couldn't taste it but they it was like a hands-on exhibit so you're
00:35:56,00:36:00,allowed to touch the bull's penis. Were you impressed? Did you congratulate the bull?
00:36:00,00:36:06,Bulls sadly never made it. Well I've been looking up at the hangover
00:36:06,00:36:15,disgusting hangover cures so Pliny the elder are old buddy and he recommends various things so he
00:36:15,00:36:21,mostly recommends things to stop me from getting drunk in the first place. For example roasted wild boar
00:36:21,00:36:29,lungs will do or if you don't have a wild boar if you have the ashes of a swallow's beak and mix it
00:36:29,00:36:34,with myr and put that in your wine that stops you getting drunk in the first place. Okay good.
00:36:34,00:36:41,But does row in the wine doesn't it? A little bit yeah. The gladiators used to eat ash for energy.
00:36:41,00:36:48,On ITV. No it was like they would used to take it out of the hearth and then they would mix it with
00:36:49,00:36:54,presumably wine I guess and then that would supposedly help them after a hard day's gladiator ring.
00:36:54,00:37:00,As for get home after a hard day's gladiator ring darling what have you cut me for supper? I'm
00:37:00,00:37:04,exhausted. Here's some ash. With some wine Anna. Oh it's no that's absolutely fine.
00:37:04,00:37:14,So John of Gadsden in the 14th century had advice for if you drunk too much he said that if you're a man
00:37:14,00:37:18,then you should wash your testicles with salt and vinegar and if you're a woman you should wash
00:37:18,00:37:24,your breasts with salt and vinegar and- Was he a salt and vinegar salesman? He liked in the local
00:37:24,00:37:31,chippy he'd overordered it and he said you can also eat the leaf or stalk of a cabbage with some
00:37:31,00:37:34,sugar which doesn't like the better option he should have put it first. So these days I guess you
00:37:34,00:37:38,could just put your testicles in a bag of salt and vinegar crisps and that'll have the same effect.
00:37:38,00:37:40,Absolutely. But don't do it in Tesco's.
00:37:42,00:37:48,Dock embryo is another thing that's eaten so this is balut. Yeah so I had that balut. Did you
00:37:48,00:37:56,use balut as I said okay. Yeah I had that. How was that? To be honest I kind of chickened out a
00:37:56,00:38:02,little bit. Dock's out you mean? Dock's out I did dock out yeah and when they weren't looking I only
00:38:02,00:38:06,took a bit of the egg part of the balut and didn't have any of the embryo part because I thought
00:38:06,00:38:12,that was a bit beyond the pale. Oh you found your line though. Well to be honest if
00:38:12,00:38:17,anyone was watching I probably would have done it because I am extremely bad with peer pressure.
00:38:17,00:38:24,But yeah I did taste it. It just tasted like I've had a one hundred year egg before
00:38:24,00:38:28,and it tastes a bit like that so it's slightly rotten though it tastes like yeah. Okay slightly
00:38:28,00:38:33,rotten you would have thought after a hundred years that really penetrated. Yeah it tastes like
00:38:33,00:38:39,sulfurous eggs like you know yeah sulfur thoughts. Yeah egg eggs. What were you said was there anything
00:38:39,00:38:46,else about balut? No that was a hang of a cure that apparently works so it's stuck embryo isn't it?
00:38:46,00:38:50,It was born alive and then you eat it in the shell. You eat it in the shell. Not shelly presumably at
00:38:50,00:38:56,embryo stage and you eat with the bee. Can you tell the beaks there? You can tell it's there but it's
00:38:56,00:39:01,not crunchy I don't think and there was a Filipino lady who works at this place and she absolutely
00:39:01,00:39:05,loves it. She's like my whole family says this is not weird. I don't understand why people think
00:39:05,00:39:11,this is weird. The Philippines are going war on Sweden to meet them. Well they do have for instance
00:39:11,00:39:17,Haggis. Do they? Yeah they have weirdly they have like harribose not harribose but like other
00:39:17,00:39:21,gelatin sweets because they're like well you know this is made from gelatin from bones of animals.
00:39:21,00:39:24,This is kind of if you think about it it's kind of weird. Yeah. It's all just it is just perspective
00:39:24,00:39:29,isn't it? I mean they think we find weird other people eat we eat equally weird stuff. I would say so
00:39:29,00:39:37,apart you know like urine soaked shark is objectively strange. What's the urine adding to that taste?
00:39:37,00:39:43,Well it adds a urine-y taste to it. If you were to have that and any other food in the whole
00:39:43,00:39:48,history of time you would know which one had been soaked in urine. Yes okay. So their rules are just
00:39:48,00:39:52,quickly go they have three rules it has to be considered disgusting by some people around the world
00:39:52,00:39:57,so not necessarily people eating it. It has to be genuinely eaten by people as a choice not
00:39:57,00:40:03,through necessity. So it's not things that you can only have because you have no other food and it
00:40:03,00:40:08,must be not a food stuff invented just for tourists. Right. Of course. Because that does happen
00:40:08,00:40:12,sometimes of course. And on the fact that it's kind of all about perspective this sort of thing
00:40:12,00:40:19,there was an FT journalist who went to China in 2011 and went to Shaoxing and was investigating what
00:40:19,00:40:23,Chinese people thought of cheese brought over from Europe. Because obviously not very much cheese
00:40:23,00:40:28,"is eaten in the East, very many of them are lactose intolerant, drink milk now a bit but cheese"
00:40:28,00:40:33,not really a thing. So brought over a whole bunch of cheeses and they find that disgusting or these
00:40:33,00:40:38,people who worked in a restaurant found it kind of gross the idea and then ate the cheeses and it
00:40:38,00:40:43,was a lot of blue cheeses very strong blue which interestingly they thought was fine. So they thought
00:40:43,00:40:49,that's okay and they said it was quite similar to a sort of rotting bean curd dish that they serve.
00:40:49,00:40:53,Had that as well rotten bean curd and it does taste quite cheesy. Does it? Yeah they said it was a
00:40:53,00:40:58,similar taste. So weirdly the only one that they all said that's absolutely disgusting is an animal
00:40:58,00:41:10,stench that haunts your nose. Baby bell. Is it is it Primula? Yeah. The multi podcast cool
00:41:10,00:41:16,back. It's not it's a breed. Which is very interesting to us. It obviously is quite mild
00:41:16,00:41:21,breed but then it's just something they're not used to. I remember reading somewhere and I don't
00:41:21,00:41:26,know where it was so I think this is true but the idea was when Europeans first went to Japan
00:41:26,00:41:31,especially that was the one overarching thing about it was that we smelled of milk and cheese and
00:41:31,00:41:34,stuff like that. Is that right? Yeah. They say that in China is what like all the time they'd be like
00:41:34,00:41:39,oh milky boys here. It's it's a smell that eminent emanates of a white person. The kind of the
00:41:39,00:41:45,milky bar kid is not a good thing. No it's fine it's just you can smell it. It's just a smell they all
00:41:45,00:41:53,identify. Do you guys know there's an iron brew sausage? I'm so choked on his. I almost I just
00:41:53,00:41:58,choked on my drink because I'm so excited. An iron brew sausage. So basically this was invented
00:41:58,00:42:02,a few years ago by a guy who said what a great hangover cure this would be. By a genius.
00:42:02,00:42:06,It's invented. Hang on we have had a debate at the party. No no Andy. We're the combining
00:42:06,00:42:11,two existing things. Cats is inventing a new one. I will accept a lot of things in this podcast
00:42:11,00:42:15,but for you to say that an iron brew sausage is not an invention that we're all culling out far.
00:42:15,00:42:21,Okay sure. It's it's pretty simple actually but so in invention you replace all the water in
00:42:21,00:42:27,the sausage making process with iron brew and he says it's a brilliant hangover cure. One guy said
00:42:27,00:42:32,he felt like he'd gone to heaven after tasting it. According to the inventor of the iron brew sausage
00:42:32,00:42:37,and I really want to try one. I do as well. If you're a people who make iron brew sausages
00:42:37,00:42:42,do get in touch. Well advertised free. Hang on. Is it all the water involved in the process?
00:42:42,00:42:47,As in has it grown the crops that feed the cow? Has the cow been drinking iron brew from the trough?
00:42:47,00:42:54,It has to have rained iron brew. Has the farmer had all the water in his body replaced with iron brew?
00:42:54,00:42:56,Yeah he's Scottish.
00:42:56,00:43:06,Okay that's it that is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening. If you'd like to get
