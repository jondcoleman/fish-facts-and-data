00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.500
 [music]

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.860
 - Hi! - Andy!

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.600
 - Hello, Andy! - Hello!

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.600
 Hi, everybody! Hello! Welcome to Drop As A Line!

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.200
 Hello to you, the listener!

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.000
 We have had a bulging post bag

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.100
 that we're going to pierce now and drain.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.600
 - Oh! - And, um...

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.900
 - Like a sack of pus! - Exactly!

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.900
 You've been in the unbox, then, James. You've seen what it's like in there.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.400
 No, we've had some cracking correspondence,

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.400
 and I'm looking forward to rootling through it with my three pals.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.900
 James, Dan, and Anna.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.200
 [laughter]

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.300
 The pause was so long that it looked like you had to look at a bit of paper

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.600
 to remember our names.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.100
 I have every show. Every show the same.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.500
 Thanks, Dan. Good joke.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.800
 Okay, here we go.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.100
 Can I share images with you? We're doing this one on Zoom.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.600
 - Yeah, you can. - Okay.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.400
 I'm going to try and share an image of something that Jill and Cliff from Aberdeen have sent.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.600
 They said, "Saw this on a lovely day in Liverpool in thought of you.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.500
 Keep up the good work. We love the show and look forward to seeing you in Glasgow."

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.600
 So, it's quite a confusing message, geographically.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.100
 Yes. A long old drive from Aberdeen to Liverpool.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.500
 Well, quite. But here we go. I'm going to share with you.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.700
 You should be able to see what I'm seeing.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.000
 It's a restaurant in Liverpool.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.700
 The Italian Club Fish!

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.500
 - It's called the Italian Club Fish. - Very cool.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.400
 - Isn't that good? - And it's almost in our colours.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.300
 - It's very faded yellow and blue. - Yeah.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:43.900
 Do you reckon their Italian Club Fish begins with a very uninspired chow?

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.500
 What a mean thing to say about my intro.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.500
 I've been working a lot on this month's intro.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.600
 I've been working on it all month.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.100
 My confidence is shot now.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.400
 This is a bit mean, though, Andy, because you're getting excited

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.900
 by something that has a slight connection to our name.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.900
 And when we were on the flight back from Dublin,

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.600
 I spotted that the book that I was reading, the imprint,

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.700
 was by a company called DS.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.500
 And in between the DNS, their logo was a fish.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.100
 And I was like, "Come on."

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.800
 And Andy sort of ripped me apart,

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.900
 going, "Oh, the universe is trying to tell you.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.500
 Not everything is the universe trying to tell you, Dan."

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.500
 And it was, yeah, I'm a bit shocked that you're now bringing up.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.400
 No, you're right.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.600
 And then I realised that my book was published by a publisher called John Murray,

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.600
 which, you know...

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.100
 Anna, you were so lucky you weren't on this flight.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.200
 No, I'm sad.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.900
 So sad that I had to catch a later one for unavoidable reasons

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.400
 that I definitely didn't specifically request to the tour manager.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.100
 Anyway, thank you, Jill and Cliff, for that bit of correspondence.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.100
 That's very cool. We should get dinner there.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.900
 This email is from someone called Gemhunter.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.900
 The universe.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.500
 No, I just mean... I don't mean my name in the middle name is Hunter.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.200
 I just mean Gemhunter is a cool name.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.700
 Yeah, that is a good name.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.700
 Just wondering if you were able to confirm my suspicion that Anna may well be a vampire.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.300
 I refer to several clues that imply the usual laws of physics do not apply to her.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.400
 These being that the Gravitron fair ride does not work on her

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.300
 and she slides to the floor while everyone else is pinned to the wall.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.500
 Yeah, I forgot I mentioned that.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.700
 I don't remember that.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.900
 Yeah, that's true.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.900
 And also that she did not float in the Dead Sea.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.700
 Yeah, that, oh my God, well spotted.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.300
 I'd never connected those two things, but now you mention it.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.500
 Have you guys noticed that when we do these zoom calls,

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.800
 my face never shows up on the video, does it?

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.300
 Yes, that's a good point.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.100
 Have you guys thought it was your laptop?

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.700
 No, I think it's the vampire thing.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.800
 And you're 400 years old.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.300
 I don't remember the Gravitron scene in Bram Stoker's novel.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.300
 They go to Alton Towers in I think it's chapters 17.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.400
 Oh, I only got as far as 16.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.300
 I think that's why.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.500
 Because he arrives in Whitby.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:05.200
 So it's one of the closer major UK theme parks on his route to London.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.900
 I don't think the laws of physics is a thing about vampires.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.200
 I think they're subject to the laws of physics.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.400
 No, well, they don't have reflections and that's the laws of physics.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.900
 So you can understand that maybe they wouldn't be prey to other laws of physics as well.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:26.000
 All right, are those the only two that surely there are other vampiric things about Anna?

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 She hates sunlight.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 Yeah, I would never invite her into my house.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 Is that?

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 That's it.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 I would never knock on your door, so it's a moot point.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.500
 Last time we went to a restaurant, she just spent the whole time counting the grains of rice.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.500
 Well, thank you, Gem.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.000
 We'll keep an eye out for more of that.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.700
 Don't keep an eye out or you'll live to regret it.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.700
 And then add some scary music after that.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:55.700
 That works.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:56.700
 Balter lightning.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:57.700
 Yeah.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:58.700
 Dan, are you eating?

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.700
 Are you having a lunch halfway through the recording?

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.700
 What the hell?

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.300
 No, I'm chewing ice by accident.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.300
 I sort of load the ice.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.300
 Sorry.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.300
 What a brilliant excuse.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.900
 No, no, I genuinely thought you just had a sneaky pasty on the girls.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.800
 Oh, I mean, I do have a bowl of fried rice next to me, but I've...

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.800
 Oh, my God.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.800
 How many grains?

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.800
 Yeah, Anna's like, "Hold that up again.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.800
 Hold that up again."

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.300
 We had some Finnish correspondents.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.000
 Do you remember we spoke about Finns not liking small talk?

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 Yeah.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 Oh, yes.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 Yeah.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.700
 So you just got some blank emails.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.800
 We had one or two negative ones, people saying you just don't understand Finnish culture.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.800
 Oh, okay.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.500
 Well, I'm afraid I'm glad to say we have many more saying, "Yes, that sort of is true.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.300
 I don't really like small talk."

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.200
 Mel writes, "I'm a Kiwi who's lived in Finland for 10 years.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.300
 I think you're safe saying Finns don't like small talk, but they're also very good at

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.300
 laughing at themselves.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.980
 During COVID, they said they couldn't wait for the two meter social distancing to end

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.580
 so they could go back to three meters."

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:03.580
 Very good.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:10.300
 Tim Hatton writes, "A friend of his got married to his Finnish girlfriend a couple of years

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.300
 ago.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.080
 He wanted to impress her family by learning a language.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.920
 When he sat down with them all for the first time, the little old Finnish granny quietly

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.280
 served him some cake.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.480
 He wanted to break the ice and tell her, "This cake is good."

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.560
 Unfortunately, it turns out that the word for cake, "kaku," is pronounced very closely

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:40.600
 to the word for "shit."

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:48.180
 Karl Bovenizer writes, "Oh, Karl, you should stop that."

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:52.300
 No cow is safe when Karl is in the area.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:53.300
 The Bovenizer.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.180
 He writes, "Love the show and listen every week.

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:56.180
 Brilliant stuff."

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:01.000
 Karl, I can't believe when discussing named clouds, you left out the biggest one.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.600
 Karl the Fog in San Francisco.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.120
 Oh, I haven't even heard Karl.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.120
 I didn't know.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.320
 The Fog is famous in San Francisco, but I had never heard of its name.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.360
 He keeps that under his hat.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.520
 It's the same Fog, kind of like Anna's Cloud is the same cloud.

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.880
 Karl, who signs off his email, Karl brackets, "Not the Fog."

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:20.880
 Right.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:24.440
 I accept that Fog is more likely a collection of cloud-like material, but it has its own

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:25.880
 Twitter account.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.980
 So that's checkmate, really.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:32.820
 We did get an email from somebody said, "Oh, I've flown through clouds lots of times,

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:34.700
 and it's much safer than you let on."

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.140
 I think we were talking about specific clouds.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.140
 Yeah, no.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:38.140
 Big old clouds.

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:39.140
 Yeah, yeah.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:40.140
 Not clouds.

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:41.140
 Cumulonimbus, specifically.

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:42.420
 I do get pissed off now.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:46.740
 And I did when the three of us were on our plane, two and from Dublin.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:53.220
 When pilots go through clouds now, I'm actively like, "I do that noise," because it's like

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:57.160
 you're forcing chaotic turbulence onto us.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.400
 What are you doing?

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.120
 How on Earth are they going to get down?

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.720
 We were above the cloud level.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:02.720
 There's gaps.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:03.720
 There's always gaps.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:04.720
 You can't find gaps.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.720
 You can't fly around for hours looking for a gap.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.720
 That's no.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.720
 Yeah, I do.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:13.400
 I know that pilots do, because they often have to land in places where they can't go

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.640
 through a cumulonimbus, for example.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.900
 It's a one-hour flight from Dublin to London.

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.960
 It would add another hour for the pilot to go around saying, "Oh, no.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.580
 I don't want to disturb Dan's drink on the tray table."

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:24.580
 It's not about the drink.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.300
 It's about people's anxiety levels.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.140
 You can cause serious problems.

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:29.140
 Sometimes it's cloudy.

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:32.100
 We did go through any major, major, massive clouds, because they would go around those.

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.580
 We just went through the clouds.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:38.020
 The other thing is that turbulence can happen in clearer, just as much as it can happen in

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:39.020
 cloudy air.

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.020
 Absolutely.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.020
 Don't pretend you didn't shriek at one point, Andy.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:47.620
 I was shrieking with boredom because you kept talking to me about this amazing coincidence

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:54.960
 on the spine of your book.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:55.960
 Let's have a bit of correspondence.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:59.120
 Oh, here's a great one from Caetano Capurro.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.720
 "Hope you're all well."

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.800
 Not a promising start, but it gets better.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:07.060
 When you discussed the percentages of political party-themed condoms, you remember this?

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:08.060
 Oh, yeah.

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.060
 I remember this.

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:10.060
 What take?

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:11.060
 Can you give us a -- yeah.

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:14.680
 It was a website that was selling condoms that had funny slogans related to all the

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:19.140
 political parties, and it turned out that the percentage of people who had bought the condoms

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:22.740
 was very, very similar to the actual polling in the country.

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:27.980
 So, like, 40% of the people who bought condoms voted Labour, and they also bought the Labour

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:28.980
 condoms.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:29.980
 Right.

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:33.360
 40% of condoms that were bought were Labour ones, and that's the same proportion.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.360
 Yeah, that's right.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.360
 Yeah, the vote share.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.360
 Right.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.360
 Yeah, yeah.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:41.540
 Well, Caetano has a little follow-up saying the result is scarily accurate, give or take,

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.800
 as in Labour was within 0.4% of the overall result.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:45.800
 Yeah.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:49.880
 I think -- oh, I see, because we did the show about three weeks before the election, didn't

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:50.880
 we?

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:51.880
 Yeah.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:52.880
 Oh, wow.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:53.880
 But the results were similar to the polls.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:54.880
 Right.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:55.880
 Okay.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:56.880
 Yeah.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:00.520
 Comparing the average difference between Ipsos final polls and customcondoms.com's final

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:05.040
 polls, custom condoms got it closer than the final poll done by Ipsos.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.040
 Wow.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.040
 That's great.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.040
 Isn't that great?

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.040
 Yeah.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:16.040
 And if you buy novelty condoms, is there anything we can deduce from -- there's Mr Bean condoms

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.040
 and stuff like that.

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.040
 What do you mean?

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.040
 Yeah.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.040
 What can we deduce?

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.440
 Well, if you were trying to work out what the most popular TV show was, and you had a

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:29.980
 series of mad men, Game of Thrones, all that sort of stuff, could you work out the country's

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.820
 taste for TV shows?

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:33.300
 Yes, I think you could.

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:38.540
 I think definitely, I can say with almost 100% certainty that if you're selling Mr Bean

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:43.940
 mad men and neighbors condoms, then the Mr Bean fans will buy the Mr Bean condoms, the

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:46.060
 mad men fans will buy the mad men ones.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:47.540
 I don't think that's necessarily true.

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:48.540
 Do you not?

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:51.140
 I think whatever the pun base is best on it.

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:55.660
 Like, you know, Mr Bean's one said bean liquor on it, and I think it doesn't make sense,

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:59.020
 but you would be buying it not because you love Mr Bean.

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:03.780
 I think that there's a thing here because the podcasting industry has a real problem

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:09.220
 with its charts, and nobody really knows how many listens every different podcast has.

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:10.700
 Like, we know how many we have.

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:13.500
 No, we're not releasing a condom range, James.

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.420
 Well, no, we should.

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:16.420
 We should.

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:20.900
 We should do one for all of the top 20 podcasts in the country and see who buys them.

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:21.900
 Right.

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:22.900
 Okay.

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:27.260
 I think parenting hell would probably win purely on the description alone.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:33.900
 I think podcast fans don't have sex, so it's just, well, that means they just buy one condom

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:34.900
 each.

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:36.900
 That makes it an even better poll.

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:39.220
 Keep it in the wallet for the rest of the lives.

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:42.980
 Both of them definitely having sex, Adam, I don't know what you're talking about.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:50.100
 It's quite hard to come up with pun, pun sex names for podcasts off menu.

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.620
 I can't think of a good pun, a sex-related pun.

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:53.620
 Oh, right, right.

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:54.620
 It'd be good for off menu.

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:55.620
 Yeah.

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:57.980
 The rest is jizz three.

00:11:57.980 --> 00:11:58.980
 Yeah.

00:11:58.980 --> 00:11:59.980
 Well, that's good.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.780
 The rest is Pollard Dicks.

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:02.780
 I can't come up with one for fish.

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:03.780
 Yeah.

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:04.780
 I can't think of any of the other podcasts.

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:05.780
 What are they?

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:06.780
 No, I mean, either.

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:07.780
 From our own correspondent.

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:08.780
 That's all.

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:10.780
 That's Radio 4 and it doesn't count.

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:11.780
 Say it anyway, listen to it.

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:12.780
 That's an Island Dicks.

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:14.980
 That is a podcast, though, isn't it?

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:17.980
 Yes, it's true.

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:18.980
 Anyway.

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:19.980
 We'll come back to it.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:20.980
 I guess we get any.

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:21.980
 Yeah.

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:22.980
 No.

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:24.460
 I'm just going to pop this outside one sec.

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:25.460
 Oh, yeah.

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:26.460
 What?

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:27.460
 Weird.

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:30.060
 Dan's just gone to put his charger outside the room.

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:32.580
 That is a reverse Amazon delivery guy.

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:38.700
 He just takes items and puts them out of his house.

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:40.180
 You're computer getting too charred.

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:41.900
 No, Fen needs the charger.

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:42.900
 Nice.

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:43.900
 I understand.

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:45.740
 Can I tell you about Gareth the Cornish Hedger?

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:47.900
 Oh, I love Cornish Hedges.

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:49.660
 It's probably one of my top five favorite topics.

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:50.660
 Yes, please.

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:53.780
 Well, Gareth has been maintaining a bit of correspondence with the Fish Inbox for some

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:54.780
 time.

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:55.780
 He's been hedging away.

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:56.780
 Okay.

00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:00.980
 So he's been keeping us updated on how many he's listened to, you know, just to inform

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:02.780
 I have now listened to 200 episodes.

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:04.180
 Some of them have been quite good.

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:05.180
 Well done.

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:06.180
 Thanks, Gareth.

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:07.180
 And so on.

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:08.180
 Yeah.

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:09.180
 And then anyway, latest update from Gareth.

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:12.580
 Sorry, this is a character who's been in my life for some time and I'm just introducing

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:13.580
 him to you all.

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:14.580
 Great.

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:20.220
 So as in after however many hundred emails, he's finally hit a winner to be coming good

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:21.220
 enough to come on our show.

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:23.620
 Well, he's listened to all the shows.

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:27.020
 I just wanted to let you know it took me 10 weeks to listen to the entire back catalogue.

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:28.020
 Oh.

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:29.020
 520 episodes.

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:30.020
 Wow.

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:31.620
 So please, can you send me loads of merch?

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:32.620
 No.

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:34.300
 And praise my name from the mountain tops.

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:35.300
 Well, we'll do that.

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:36.300
 Thank you very much, Gareth.

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:40.020
 Can he let us know if any of the ad points are in the wrong position?

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:41.020
 Yeah.

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:46.380
 Yeah, I feel like if anyone listening is going to go back and listen from the start in one

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:50.420
 bolt go, could you let us know first because there is bits of admin we'd love to be able

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:51.420
 to find out.

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:54.620
 We can't afford to pay it in turn.

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:55.620
 So Gareth the Hedgehog.

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:56.620
 Anyway, thank you, Gareth.

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:57.620
 That's great.

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:00.140
 I can't believe he didn't make it through with his first email where he said he was

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:01.140
 a Cornish Hedgehog.

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:02.140
 I know.

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:06.060
 Well, Liv claims that she's listened to all 700 episodes.

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:07.060
 Liv Malone.

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:08.060
 Okay.

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:09.060
 In the space of two months.

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:10.060
 700.

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:11.060
 Yeah.

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:12.060
 Let's work that out.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:13.060
 She means something.

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:14.060
 I guess bonus episodes and drops the lines.

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:15.060
 Drops the lines.

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:16.060
 Yeah.

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:17.060
 All right.

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:18.060
 So that's two months, 10 weeks.

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:19.060
 They're pretty similar times.

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:21.860
 How productive is Liv at work, do we think?

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:25.580
 Do you know, oddly, she says, if anyone asks me, if anyone in charge of me at my place

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:29.900
 of work asks, because that isn't true, that I've done that and I'm very productive.

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:30.900
 Right.

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:31.900
 So, yeah.

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:36.300
 Your Liv's employer, maybe a little review.

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:41.420
 Keegan from Bloomington, Indiana, who says to add to your recent discussions of the 14

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:43.500
 tube notes in Dvorak Symphony No. 9.

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:44.500
 Oh my God.

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:45.500
 Yes.

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:49.900
 I'm a semi-professional orchestra percussionist and we are frequently the only people on stage

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:52.900
 with even fewer notes than the Tuba.

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:54.500
 So this is great.

00:14:54.500 --> 00:15:00.820
 Most notably in Brookner's 7th Symphony, there is only a single cymbal clash and a single

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:02.180
 triangle roll.

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:06.140
 The two percussionists have to wait until about 45 minutes into the massive 80-minute

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:09.460
 symphony in order to get their one note each.

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:13.020
 What makes it even sillier is that the cymbal crash and triangle roll happen at the same

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:19.620
 time, so you do need two players there to perform it, both are being paid the same wage

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:23.180
 as other members of the orchestra, many of whom are playing thousands of notes while

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:24.180
 the percussionist plays one.

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:29.180
 I'm not being funny, but I would say, I know it's a very skilled job to be a percussionist,

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:34.460
 but if it's just banging some cymbals together, I would think that the second oboe could just

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:35.460
 double up.

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:36.460
 Yeah.

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:37.460
 Save the money.

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:41.100
 Well, Keegan writes, "There's a popular story in the percussion world, likely apocryphal,

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:45.020
 of a cymbal player who psyched himself out so much in the 45 minutes leading up to the

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:49.820
 crash that, despite standing and picking up the cymbals at the right time, he froze and

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:50.820
 missed it.

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:54.180
 He then had to put the cymbals down and sit back down."

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:55.500
 It makes so much sense.

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:58.020
 There's too much pressure on a single note.

00:15:58.020 --> 00:15:59.860
 When you've got lots of notes, it's fine.

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:00.860
 You can find your feet.

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:01.860
 You can warm up.

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:02.860
 Anyway, thank you, Keegan.

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:03.860
 That's amazing.

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:08.100
 I'd love to know if Keegan needs sheet music for his gig.

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:12.420
 I think he just can count the 45 minutes in his head.

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:15.300
 That's fine.

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:20.340
 I wonder what the most a triangle, like if that's the least that your gig gets out of

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:27.260
 you, one note for a whole piece, what's the most a triangle has ever been worked in an

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:28.260
 orchestra?

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:29.260
 Oh, yeah.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.180
 Is there not a triangle concerto that someone wrote?

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:32.700
 I feel like there is.

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:33.700
 Right.

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:34.700
 I think so.

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:36.940
 Triangles have, this is really ignorant.

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:37.940
 I don't know.

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:41.140
 There's no apologies to triangle players, but are there different notes or is it the

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:42.140
 same notes?

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:46.520
 A triangle concerto sounds not very good to listen to.

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:48.300
 It's mostly the rest of the orchestra.

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:49.940
 It's mostly the background stuff.

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:50.940
 Right.

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:51.940
 Yeah.

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:52.940
 Yeah.

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:53.940
 Okay.

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:54.940
 I think musicians should be paid by the note.

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:55.940
 Wow.

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:56.940
 Interesting.

00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:57.940
 Yeah.

00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:58.940
 Yeah.

00:16:58.940 --> 00:16:59.940
 And by the beat.

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:03.940
 So if you're playing a semi-brief, you get four times as much as a crotchet or whatever

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:04.940
 semi-brief is.

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:09.980
 Well, the thing is, like it's very important in an orchestra to have your, let's say you've

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:15.100
 got a euphonium just going boom, boom, boom.

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:21.020
 And then you've got your violin going, they're both almost as important as each other.

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:22.020
 Really?

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:24.660
 Anna, that's a boss class thing to say.

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:32.340
 And I want to stick up on behalf of the unionized musicians who you've got to turn up, you get

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:33.340
 paid.

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:40.980
 Do you know how, if you have unprotected sex, then you might get an STD or something?

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:41.980
 What?

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:42.980
 Yeah.

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:43.980
 Okay.

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:48.220
 So the people who use condoms wouldn't, but the people who don't use condoms might.

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:55.060
 And so you could call your company, the rest is poorly dicks.

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:58.420
 Yeah.

00:17:58.420 --> 00:17:59.420
 That's good.

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:00.420
 Yeah.

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:03.180
 I think that was almost worth the wait.

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:09.460
 I've just, I've been silent for the last 25 minutes, like a triangle player for an orchestra,

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:10.900
 just working that out.

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:12.980
 And I feel like I froze a little bit.

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:17.660
 I think you should have just sat back down.

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:22.020
 Here's an actual achievement by a listener, and this is an anonymous correspondent who

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:25.700
 writes, "Watching the Paralympics today, I thought the team would love to be reminded

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:27.660
 of one of your past correspondence.

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:33.260
 In fact, not just a listener, a clubfish member has entered an even more special club.

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:36.380
 Our anonymous correspondent writes, "Sophie Unwin wrote you an email that you read out

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:38.820
 in the February 2024, drop us a line.

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:42.600
 This was in the intermittent discussions of the varieties of the phrase, can you smell

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.260
 my ass?

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:49.400
 She is a Team GB Paralympic cyclist in the visually impaired classification and rides

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.940
 a tandem with a sighted pilot cyclist.

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:55.020
 She felt that her sport qualified as the most ass-smelling sport."

00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:56.020
 Oh my God.

00:18:56.020 --> 00:19:02.940
 She just got a bronze medal, a gold medal, and a world record at the Paris Paralympics.

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:03.940
 Oh my God.

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:05.940
 An amazing Sophie Unwin.

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:14.140
 Imagine the difficulty I had over the last month to book Olympians and Paralympians for

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:15.940
 our other podcast.

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:17.140
 Quite a good spot.

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:20.300
 And I forgot that we had one who wrote into clubfish.

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:21.300
 That is amazing.

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:22.980
 Are you still listening, Sophie?

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:23.980
 Congratulations.

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:24.980
 That's incredible.

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:25.980
 It's so exciting.

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:27.220
 Come and talk to us.

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:29.860
 We'll back edit you into our show.

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:31.420
 That's so cool.

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:32.420
 That's amazing.

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:33.420
 Yeah.

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:34.420
 Yeah.

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:35.420
 Congratulations, Sophie.

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:36.420
 Incredible.

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:37.420
 What was the line?

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:39.700
 Can you smell my ass?

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:41.220
 It was the basketball thing.

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:42.220
 Yeah, no.

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:48.820
 It was about, it was Shaq and someone else, it was a, but we just, we quoted it wrong.

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:50.820
 How have we not done that as a t-shirt?

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:51.820
 How?

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:53.980
 That is, that is our next t-shirt.

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:54.980
 Ah.

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:55.980
 Olympians.

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:56.980
 Cool.

00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:57.980
 Very cool.

00:19:57.980 --> 00:19:58.980
 Bye.

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:02.940
 Thank you for listening.

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:07.220
 If you've got something to tell us, then tell us at podcast@qi.com.

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:11.220
 You know, send in your expertise, your thoughts, your witty banter.

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:12.220
 Sometimes just praise.

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:13.220
 That's also fine.

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:15.740
 We love getting your emails and we'll keep reading them.

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:16.900
 And there we go.

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:17.900
 Bag drained.

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:19.700
 And we'll see you next time.

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:21.740
 Is that your new outro, Andy?

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:22.740
 Bag drained.

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:28.940
 It's a big symbol at the end.

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:29.940
 Lovely.

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:29.940
 Bye.

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:32.520
 (upbeat music)

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:35.100
 (upbeat music)
