00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,500
 [music]

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,860
 - Hi! - Andy!

3
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,600
 - Hello, Andy! - Hello!

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,600
 Hi, everybody! Hello! Welcome to Drop As A Line!

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,200
 Hello to you, the listener!

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,000
 We have had a bulging post bag

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,100
 that we're going to pierce now and drain.

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,600
 - Oh! - And, um...

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,900
 - Like a sack of pus! - Exactly!

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,900
 You've been in the unbox, then, James. You've seen what it's like in there.

11
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,400
 No, we've had some cracking correspondence,

12
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,400
 and I'm looking forward to rootling through it with my three pals.

13
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,900
 James, Dan, and Anna.

14
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,200
 [laughter]

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,300
 The pause was so long that it looked like you had to look at a bit of paper

16
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,600
 to remember our names.

17
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,100
 I have every show. Every show the same.

18
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,500
 Thanks, Dan. Good joke.

19
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,800
 Okay, here we go.

20
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,100
 Can I share images with you? We're doing this one on Zoom.

21
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,600
 - Yeah, you can. - Okay.

22
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,400
 I'm going to try and share an image of something that Jill and Cliff from Aberdeen have sent.

23
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,600
 They said, "Saw this on a lovely day in Liverpool in thought of you.

24
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,500
 Keep up the good work. We love the show and look forward to seeing you in Glasgow."

25
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,600
 So, it's quite a confusing message, geographically.

26
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,100
 Yes. A long old drive from Aberdeen to Liverpool.

27
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,500
 Well, quite. But here we go. I'm going to share with you.

28
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,700
 You should be able to see what I'm seeing.

29
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,000
 It's a restaurant in Liverpool.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,700
 The Italian Club Fish!

31
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,500
 - It's called the Italian Club Fish. - Very cool.

32
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,400
 - Isn't that good? - And it's almost in our colours.

33
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,300
 - It's very faded yellow and blue. - Yeah.

34
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:43,900
 Do you reckon their Italian Club Fish begins with a very uninspired chow?

35
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,500
 What a mean thing to say about my intro.

36
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,500
 I've been working a lot on this month's intro.

37
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,600
 I've been working on it all month.

38
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,100
 My confidence is shot now.

39
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,400
 This is a bit mean, though, Andy, because you're getting excited

40
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,900
 by something that has a slight connection to our name.

41
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,900
 And when we were on the flight back from Dublin,

42
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,600
 I spotted that the book that I was reading, the imprint,

43
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,700
 was by a company called DS.

44
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,500
 And in between the DNS, their logo was a fish.

45
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,100
 And I was like, "Come on."

46
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,800
 And Andy sort of ripped me apart,

47
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,900
 going, "Oh, the universe is trying to tell you.

48
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,500
 Not everything is the universe trying to tell you, Dan."

49
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,500
 And it was, yeah, I'm a bit shocked that you're now bringing up.

50
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,400
 No, you're right.

51
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,600
 And then I realised that my book was published by a publisher called John Murray,

52
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,600
 which, you know...

53
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,100
 Anna, you were so lucky you weren't on this flight.

54
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,200
 No, I'm sad.

55
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,900
 So sad that I had to catch a later one for unavoidable reasons

56
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,400
 that I definitely didn't specifically request to the tour manager.

57
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,100
 Anyway, thank you, Jill and Cliff, for that bit of correspondence.

58
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,100
 That's very cool. We should get dinner there.

59
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,900
 This email is from someone called Gemhunter.

60
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,900
 The universe.

61
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,500
 No, I just mean... I don't mean my name in the middle name is Hunter.

62
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,200
 I just mean Gemhunter is a cool name.

63
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,700
 Yeah, that is a good name.

64
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,700
 Just wondering if you were able to confirm my suspicion that Anna may well be a vampire.

65
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:11,300
 I refer to several clues that imply the usual laws of physics do not apply to her.

66
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,400
 These being that the Gravitron fair ride does not work on her

67
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,300
 and she slides to the floor while everyone else is pinned to the wall.

68
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,500
 Yeah, I forgot I mentioned that.

69
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,700
 I don't remember that.

70
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,900
 Yeah, that's true.

71
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,900
 And also that she did not float in the Dead Sea.

72
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,700
 Yeah, that, oh my God, well spotted.

73
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,300
 I'd never connected those two things, but now you mention it.

74
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,500
 Have you guys noticed that when we do these zoom calls,

75
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,800
 my face never shows up on the video, does it?

76
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,300
 Yes, that's a good point.

77
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,100
 Have you guys thought it was your laptop?

78
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,700
 No, I think it's the vampire thing.

79
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,800
 And you're 400 years old.

80
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:49,300
 I don't remember the Gravitron scene in Bram Stoker's novel.

81
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:53,300
 They go to Alton Towers in I think it's chapters 17.

82
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,400
 Oh, I only got as far as 16.

83
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,300
 I think that's why.

84
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,500
 Because he arrives in Whitby.

85
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:05,200
 So it's one of the closer major UK theme parks on his route to London.

86
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,900
 I don't think the laws of physics is a thing about vampires.

87
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,200
 I think they're subject to the laws of physics.

88
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,400
 No, well, they don't have reflections and that's the laws of physics.

89
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,900
 So you can understand that maybe they wouldn't be prey to other laws of physics as well.

90
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:26,000
 All right, are those the only two that surely there are other vampiric things about Anna?

91
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 She hates sunlight.

92
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Yeah, I would never invite her into my house.

93
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 Is that?

94
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 That's it.

95
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 I would never knock on your door, so it's a moot point.

96
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,500
 Last time we went to a restaurant, she just spent the whole time counting the grains of rice.

97
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,500
 Well, thank you, Gem.

98
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,000
 We'll keep an eye out for more of that.

99
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,700
 Don't keep an eye out or you'll live to regret it.

100
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,700
 And then add some scary music after that.

101
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,700
 That works.

102
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,700
 Balter lightning.

103
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,700
 Yeah.

104
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,700
 Dan, are you eating?

105
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:03,700
 Are you having a lunch halfway through the recording?

106
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,700
 What the hell?

107
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,300
 No, I'm chewing ice by accident.

108
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,300
 I sort of load the ice.

109
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,300
 Sorry.

110
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,300
 What a brilliant excuse.

111
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,900
 No, no, I genuinely thought you just had a sneaky pasty on the girls.

112
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,800
 Oh, I mean, I do have a bowl of fried rice next to me, but I've...

113
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,800
 Oh, my God.

114
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,800
 How many grains?

115
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
 Yeah, Anna's like, "Hold that up again.

116
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,800
 Hold that up again."

117
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,300
 We had some Finnish correspondents.

118
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:32,000
 Do you remember we spoke about Finns not liking small talk?

119
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 Yeah.

120
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 Oh, yes.

121
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 Yeah.

122
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,700
 So you just got some blank emails.

123
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,800
 We had one or two negative ones, people saying you just don't understand Finnish culture.

124
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,800
 Oh, okay.

125
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,500
 Well, I'm afraid I'm glad to say we have many more saying, "Yes, that sort of is true.

126
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,300
 I don't really like small talk."

127
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,200
 Mel writes, "I'm a Kiwi who's lived in Finland for 10 years.

128
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,300
 I think you're safe saying Finns don't like small talk, but they're also very good at

129
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,300
 laughing at themselves.

130
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,980
 During COVID, they said they couldn't wait for the two meter social distancing to end

131
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,580
 so they could go back to three meters."

132
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,580
 Very good.

133
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:10,300
 Tim Hatton writes, "A friend of his got married to his Finnish girlfriend a couple of years

134
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,300
 ago.

135
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,080
 He wanted to impress her family by learning a language.

136
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,920
 When he sat down with them all for the first time, the little old Finnish granny quietly

137
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,280
 served him some cake.

138
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,480
 He wanted to break the ice and tell her, "This cake is good."

139
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,560
 Unfortunately, it turns out that the word for cake, "kaku," is pronounced very closely

140
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:40,600
 to the word for "shit."

141
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:48,180
 Karl Bovenizer writes, "Oh, Karl, you should stop that."

142
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,300
 No cow is safe when Karl is in the area.

143
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,300
 The Bovenizer.

144
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,180
 He writes, "Love the show and listen every week.

145
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,180
 Brilliant stuff."

146
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:01,000
 Karl, I can't believe when discussing named clouds, you left out the biggest one.

147
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,600
 Karl the Fog in San Francisco.

148
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,120
 Oh, I haven't even heard Karl.

149
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,120
 I didn't know.

150
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,320
 The Fog is famous in San Francisco, but I had never heard of its name.

151
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,360
 He keeps that under his hat.

152
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,520
 It's the same Fog, kind of like Anna's Cloud is the same cloud.

153
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,880
 Karl, who signs off his email, Karl brackets, "Not the Fog."

154
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,880
 Right.

155
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,440
 I accept that Fog is more likely a collection of cloud-like material, but it has its own

156
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,880
 Twitter account.

157
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,980
 So that's checkmate, really.

158
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:32,820
 We did get an email from somebody said, "Oh, I've flown through clouds lots of times,

159
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,700
 and it's much safer than you let on."

160
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,140
 I think we were talking about specific clouds.

161
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,140
 Yeah, no.

162
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,140
 Big old clouds.

163
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,140
 Yeah, yeah.

164
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,140
 Not clouds.

165
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,140
 Cumulonimbus, specifically.

166
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,420
 I do get pissed off now.

167
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:46,740
 And I did when the three of us were on our plane, two and from Dublin.

168
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:53,220
 When pilots go through clouds now, I'm actively like, "I do that noise," because it's like

169
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:57,160
 you're forcing chaotic turbulence onto us.

170
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,400
 What are you doing?

171
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,120
 How on Earth are they going to get down?

172
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,720
 We were above the cloud level.

173
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,720
 There's gaps.

174
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,720
 There's always gaps.

175
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,720
 You can't find gaps.

176
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,720
 You can't fly around for hours looking for a gap.

177
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,720
 That's no.

178
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,720
 Yeah, I do.

179
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,400
 I know that pilots do, because they often have to land in places where they can't go

180
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,640
 through a cumulonimbus, for example.

181
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,900
 It's a one-hour flight from Dublin to London.

182
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,960
 It would add another hour for the pilot to go around saying, "Oh, no.

183
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,580
 I don't want to disturb Dan's drink on the tray table."

184
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,580
 It's not about the drink.

185
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,300
 It's about people's anxiety levels.

186
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,140
 You can cause serious problems.

187
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,140
 Sometimes it's cloudy.

188
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:32,100
 We did go through any major, major, massive clouds, because they would go around those.

189
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,580
 We just went through the clouds.

190
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:38,020
 The other thing is that turbulence can happen in clearer, just as much as it can happen in

191
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,020
 cloudy air.

192
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,020
 Absolutely.

193
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,020
 Don't pretend you didn't shriek at one point, Andy.

194
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:47,620
 I was shrieking with boredom because you kept talking to me about this amazing coincidence

195
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:54,960
 on the spine of your book.

196
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,960
 Let's have a bit of correspondence.

197
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,120
 Oh, here's a great one from Caetano Capurro.

198
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,720
 "Hope you're all well."

199
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,800
 Not a promising start, but it gets better.

200
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,060
 When you discussed the percentages of political party-themed condoms, you remember this?

201
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,060
 Oh, yeah.

202
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,060
 I remember this.

203
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,060
 What take?

204
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,060
 Can you give us a -- yeah.

205
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:14,680
 It was a website that was selling condoms that had funny slogans related to all the

206
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,140
 political parties, and it turned out that the percentage of people who had bought the condoms

207
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,740
 was very, very similar to the actual polling in the country.

208
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,980
 So, like, 40% of the people who bought condoms voted Labour, and they also bought the Labour

209
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,980
 condoms.

210
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:29,980
 Right.

211
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,360
 40% of condoms that were bought were Labour ones, and that's the same proportion.

212
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,360
 Yeah, that's right.

213
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,360
 Yeah, the vote share.

214
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,360
 Right.

215
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,360
 Yeah, yeah.

216
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,540
 Well, Caetano has a little follow-up saying the result is scarily accurate, give or take,

217
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,800
 as in Labour was within 0.4% of the overall result.

218
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,800
 Yeah.

219
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,880
 I think -- oh, I see, because we did the show about three weeks before the election, didn't

220
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,880
 we?

221
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,880
 Yeah.

222
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,880
 Oh, wow.

223
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,880
 But the results were similar to the polls.

224
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,880
 Right.

225
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,880
 Okay.

226
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,880
 Yeah.

227
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,520
 Comparing the average difference between Ipsos final polls and customcondoms.com's final

228
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:05,040
 polls, custom condoms got it closer than the final poll done by Ipsos.

229
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,040
 Wow.

230
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,040
 That's great.

231
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,040
 Isn't that great?

232
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,040
 Yeah.

233
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:16,040
 And if you buy novelty condoms, is there anything we can deduce from -- there's Mr Bean condoms

234
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,040
 and stuff like that.

235
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,040
 What do you mean?

236
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,040
 Yeah.

237
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,040
 What can we deduce?

238
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,440
 Well, if you were trying to work out what the most popular TV show was, and you had a

239
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:29,980
 series of mad men, Game of Thrones, all that sort of stuff, could you work out the country's

240
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,820
 taste for TV shows?

241
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,300
 Yes, I think you could.

242
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:38,540
 I think definitely, I can say with almost 100% certainty that if you're selling Mr Bean

243
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:43,940
 mad men and neighbors condoms, then the Mr Bean fans will buy the Mr Bean condoms, the

244
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,060
 mad men fans will buy the mad men ones.

245
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,540
 I don't think that's necessarily true.

246
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,540
 Do you not?

247
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,140
 I think whatever the pun base is best on it.

248
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:55,660
 Like, you know, Mr Bean's one said bean liquor on it, and I think it doesn't make sense,

249
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:59,020
 but you would be buying it not because you love Mr Bean.

250
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:03,780
 I think that there's a thing here because the podcasting industry has a real problem

251
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:09,220
 with its charts, and nobody really knows how many listens every different podcast has.

252
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,700
 Like, we know how many we have.

253
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,500
 No, we're not releasing a condom range, James.

254
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,420
 Well, no, we should.

255
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,420
 We should.

256
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:20,900
 We should do one for all of the top 20 podcasts in the country and see who buys them.

257
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,900
 Right.

258
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,900
 Okay.

259
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:27,260
 I think parenting hell would probably win purely on the description alone.

260
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:33,900
 I think podcast fans don't have sex, so it's just, well, that means they just buy one condom

261
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,900
 each.

262
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,900
 That makes it an even better poll.

263
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,220
 Keep it in the wallet for the rest of the lives.

264
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:42,980
 Both of them definitely having sex, Adam, I don't know what you're talking about.

265
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:50,100
 It's quite hard to come up with pun, pun sex names for podcasts off menu.

266
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,620
 I can't think of a good pun, a sex-related pun.

267
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,620
 Oh, right, right.

268
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,620
 It'd be good for off menu.

269
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,620
 Yeah.

270
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,980
 The rest is jizz three.

271
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:58,980
 Yeah.

272
00:11:58,980 --> 00:11:59,980
 Well, that's good.

273
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,780
 The rest is Pollard Dicks.

274
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,780
 I can't come up with one for fish.

275
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,780
 Yeah.

276
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,780
 I can't think of any of the other podcasts.

277
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,780
 What are they?

278
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,780
 No, I mean, either.

279
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,780
 From our own correspondent.

280
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:08,780
 That's all.

281
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,780
 That's Radio 4 and it doesn't count.

282
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:11,780
 Say it anyway, listen to it.

283
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,780
 That's an Island Dicks.

284
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,980
 That is a podcast, though, isn't it?

285
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,980
 Yes, it's true.

286
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:18,980
 Anyway.

287
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,980
 We'll come back to it.

288
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,980
 I guess we get any.

289
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:21,980
 Yeah.

290
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,980
 No.

291
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,460
 I'm just going to pop this outside one sec.

292
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,460
 Oh, yeah.

293
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,460
 What?

294
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,460
 Weird.

295
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,060
 Dan's just gone to put his charger outside the room.

296
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,580
 That is a reverse Amazon delivery guy.

297
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:38,700
 He just takes items and puts them out of his house.

298
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,180
 You're computer getting too charred.

299
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,900
 No, Fen needs the charger.

300
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,900
 Nice.

301
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,900
 I understand.

302
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,740
 Can I tell you about Gareth the Cornish Hedger?

303
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,900
 Oh, I love Cornish Hedges.

304
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,660
 It's probably one of my top five favorite topics.

305
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,660
 Yes, please.

306
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,780
 Well, Gareth has been maintaining a bit of correspondence with the Fish Inbox for some

307
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,780
 time.

308
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,780
 He's been hedging away.

309
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,780
 Okay.

310
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:00,980
 So he's been keeping us updated on how many he's listened to, you know, just to inform

311
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,780
 I have now listened to 200 episodes.

312
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,180
 Some of them have been quite good.

313
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,180
 Well done.

314
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,180
 Thanks, Gareth.

315
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,180
 And so on.

316
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,180
 Yeah.

317
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,180
 And then anyway, latest update from Gareth.

318
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:12,580
 Sorry, this is a character who's been in my life for some time and I'm just introducing

319
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,580
 him to you all.

320
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,580
 Great.

321
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:20,220
 So as in after however many hundred emails, he's finally hit a winner to be coming good

322
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,220
 enough to come on our show.

323
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,620
 Well, he's listened to all the shows.

324
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:27,020
 I just wanted to let you know it took me 10 weeks to listen to the entire back catalogue.

325
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,020
 Oh.

326
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,020
 520 episodes.

327
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,020
 Wow.

328
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,620
 So please, can you send me loads of merch?

329
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,620
 No.

330
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,300
 And praise my name from the mountain tops.

331
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,300
 Well, we'll do that.

332
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,300
 Thank you very much, Gareth.

333
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:40,020
 Can he let us know if any of the ad points are in the wrong position?

334
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,020
 Yeah.

335
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:46,380
 Yeah, I feel like if anyone listening is going to go back and listen from the start in one

336
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:50,420
 bolt go, could you let us know first because there is bits of admin we'd love to be able

337
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,420
 to find out.

338
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,620
 We can't afford to pay it in turn.

339
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,620
 So Gareth the Hedgehog.

340
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,620
 Anyway, thank you, Gareth.

341
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,620
 That's great.

342
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,140
 I can't believe he didn't make it through with his first email where he said he was

343
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,140
 a Cornish Hedgehog.

344
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,140
 I know.

345
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:06,060
 Well, Liv claims that she's listened to all 700 episodes.

346
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,060
 Liv Malone.

347
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,060
 Okay.

348
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,060
 In the space of two months.

349
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,060
 700.

350
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,060
 Yeah.

351
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,060
 Let's work that out.

352
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,060
 She means something.

353
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,060
 I guess bonus episodes and drops the lines.

354
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,060
 Drops the lines.

355
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,060
 Yeah.

356
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,060
 All right.

357
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,060
 So that's two months, 10 weeks.

358
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,060
 They're pretty similar times.

359
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,860
 How productive is Liv at work, do we think?

360
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:25,580
 Do you know, oddly, she says, if anyone asks me, if anyone in charge of me at my place

361
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:29,900
 of work asks, because that isn't true, that I've done that and I'm very productive.

362
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,900
 Right.

363
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,900
 So, yeah.

364
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:36,300
 Your Liv's employer, maybe a little review.

365
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:41,420
 Keegan from Bloomington, Indiana, who says to add to your recent discussions of the 14

366
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,500
 tube notes in Dvorak Symphony No. 9.

367
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,500
 Oh my God.

368
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,500
 Yes.

369
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,900
 I'm a semi-professional orchestra percussionist and we are frequently the only people on stage

370
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,900
 with even fewer notes than the Tuba.

371
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,500
 So this is great.

372
00:14:54,500 --> 00:15:00,820
 Most notably in Brookner's 7th Symphony, there is only a single cymbal clash and a single

373
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,180
 triangle roll.

374
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:06,140
 The two percussionists have to wait until about 45 minutes into the massive 80-minute

375
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:09,460
 symphony in order to get their one note each.

376
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:13,020
 What makes it even sillier is that the cymbal crash and triangle roll happen at the same

377
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:19,620
 time, so you do need two players there to perform it, both are being paid the same wage

378
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:23,180
 as other members of the orchestra, many of whom are playing thousands of notes while

379
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,180
 the percussionist plays one.

380
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:29,180
 I'm not being funny, but I would say, I know it's a very skilled job to be a percussionist,

381
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:34,460
 but if it's just banging some cymbals together, I would think that the second oboe could just

382
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,460
 double up.

383
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,460
 Yeah.

384
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,460
 Save the money.

385
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:41,100
 Well, Keegan writes, "There's a popular story in the percussion world, likely apocryphal,

386
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:45,020
 of a cymbal player who psyched himself out so much in the 45 minutes leading up to the

387
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:49,820
 crash that, despite standing and picking up the cymbals at the right time, he froze and

388
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,820
 missed it.

389
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:54,180
 He then had to put the cymbals down and sit back down."

390
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,500
 It makes so much sense.

391
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,020
 There's too much pressure on a single note.

392
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,860
 When you've got lots of notes, it's fine.

393
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,860
 You can find your feet.

394
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:01,860
 You can warm up.

395
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,860
 Anyway, thank you, Keegan.

396
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:03,860
 That's amazing.

397
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:08,100
 I'd love to know if Keegan needs sheet music for his gig.

398
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:12,420
 I think he just can count the 45 minutes in his head.

399
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,300
 That's fine.

400
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:20,340
 I wonder what the most a triangle, like if that's the least that your gig gets out of

401
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:27,260
 you, one note for a whole piece, what's the most a triangle has ever been worked in an

402
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,260
 orchestra?

403
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,260
 Oh, yeah.

404
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,180
 Is there not a triangle concerto that someone wrote?

405
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,700
 I feel like there is.

406
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,700
 Right.

407
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,700
 I think so.

408
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,940
 Triangles have, this is really ignorant.

409
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:37,940
 I don't know.

410
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,140
 There's no apologies to triangle players, but are there different notes or is it the

411
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,140
 same notes?

412
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:46,520
 A triangle concerto sounds not very good to listen to.

413
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,300
 It's mostly the rest of the orchestra.

414
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,940
 It's mostly the background stuff.

415
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,940
 Right.

416
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:51,940
 Yeah.

417
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:52,940
 Yeah.

418
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,940
 Okay.

419
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,940
 I think musicians should be paid by the note.

420
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:55,940
 Wow.

421
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,940
 Interesting.

422
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:57,940
 Yeah.

423
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:58,940
 Yeah.

424
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:59,940
 And by the beat.

425
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,940
 So if you're playing a semi-brief, you get four times as much as a crotchet or whatever

426
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,940
 semi-brief is.

427
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:09,980
 Well, the thing is, like it's very important in an orchestra to have your, let's say you've

428
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:15,100
 got a euphonium just going boom, boom, boom.

429
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:21,020
 And then you've got your violin going, they're both almost as important as each other.

430
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,020
 Really?

431
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,660
 Anna, that's a boss class thing to say.

432
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:32,340
 And I want to stick up on behalf of the unionized musicians who you've got to turn up, you get

433
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,340
 paid.

434
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:40,980
 Do you know how, if you have unprotected sex, then you might get an STD or something?

435
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:41,980
 What?

436
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:42,980
 Yeah.

437
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:43,980
 Okay.

438
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:48,220
 So the people who use condoms wouldn't, but the people who don't use condoms might.

439
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:55,060
 And so you could call your company, the rest is poorly dicks.

440
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:58,420
 Yeah.

441
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,420
 That's good.

442
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,420
 Yeah.

443
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,180
 I think that was almost worth the wait.

444
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:09,460
 I've just, I've been silent for the last 25 minutes, like a triangle player for an orchestra,

445
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,900
 just working that out.

446
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,980
 And I feel like I froze a little bit.

447
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:17,660
 I think you should have just sat back down.

448
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:22,020
 Here's an actual achievement by a listener, and this is an anonymous correspondent who

449
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:25,700
 writes, "Watching the Paralympics today, I thought the team would love to be reminded

450
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,660
 of one of your past correspondence.

451
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:33,260
 In fact, not just a listener, a clubfish member has entered an even more special club.

452
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:36,380
 Our anonymous correspondent writes, "Sophie Unwin wrote you an email that you read out

453
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,820
 in the February 2024, drop us a line.

454
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:42,600
 This was in the intermittent discussions of the varieties of the phrase, can you smell

455
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,260
 my ass?

456
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:49,400
 She is a Team GB Paralympic cyclist in the visually impaired classification and rides

457
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,940
 a tandem with a sighted pilot cyclist.

458
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:55,020
 She felt that her sport qualified as the most ass-smelling sport."

459
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,020
 Oh my God.

460
00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:02,940
 She just got a bronze medal, a gold medal, and a world record at the Paris Paralympics.

461
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:03,940
 Oh my God.

462
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,940
 An amazing Sophie Unwin.

463
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:14,140
 Imagine the difficulty I had over the last month to book Olympians and Paralympians for

464
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,940
 our other podcast.

465
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,140
 Quite a good spot.

466
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:20,300
 And I forgot that we had one who wrote into clubfish.

467
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,300
 That is amazing.

468
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,980
 Are you still listening, Sophie?

469
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:23,980
 Congratulations.

470
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,980
 That's incredible.

471
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:25,980
 It's so exciting.

472
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,220
 Come and talk to us.

473
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,860
 We'll back edit you into our show.

474
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,420
 That's so cool.

475
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,420
 That's amazing.

476
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,420
 Yeah.

477
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,420
 Yeah.

478
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,420
 Congratulations, Sophie.

479
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,420
 Incredible.

480
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,420
 What was the line?

481
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,700
 Can you smell my ass?

482
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,220
 It was the basketball thing.

483
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,220
 Yeah, no.

484
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:48,820
 It was about, it was Shaq and someone else, it was a, but we just, we quoted it wrong.

485
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,820
 How have we not done that as a t-shirt?

486
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,820
 How?

487
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,980
 That is, that is our next t-shirt.

488
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:54,980
 Ah.

489
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:55,980
 Olympians.

490
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:56,980
 Cool.

491
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:57,980
 Very cool.

492
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:58,980
 Bye.

493
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:02,940
 Thank you for listening.

494
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:07,220
 If you've got something to tell us, then tell us at podcast@qi.com.

495
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:11,220
 You know, send in your expertise, your thoughts, your witty banter.

496
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,220
 Sometimes just praise.

497
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,220
 That's also fine.

498
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,740
 We love getting your emails and we'll keep reading them.

499
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,900
 And there we go.

500
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,900
 Bag drained.

501
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,700
 And we'll see you next time.

502
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,740
 Is that your new outro, Andy?

503
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,740
 Bag drained.

504
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:28,940
 It's a big symbol at the end.

505
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,940
 Lovely.

506
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:29,940
 Bye.

507
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,520
 (upbeat music)

508
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,100
 (upbeat music)
