00:00:12,00:00:18,about both of them. So one of them is on the 7th of June and that's in Belgium.

00:00:23,00:00:28,"This is run by long time friend of the podcast, Leven Skida. It's such a good festival. There's"
00:00:28,00:00:34,"all sorts of amazing sciencey, nerdy, comedy, brilliant stuff there, including a show from"
00:00:34,00:00:38,us. We're going to be doing a show there on the 7th of June which is a Saturday and the
00:00:38,00:00:43,whole festival is amazing. It's just an amazing weekend of wonderful things going on. It's

00:01:10,00:01:14,"and as I already said it, you know the address. It's the same as the show name. It's always"
00:01:14,00:01:18,"the same. For God's sake, why do we keep saying it? Yeah. Alright, see you at those shows."
00:01:18,00:01:20,On with the podcast. On with the show.
00:01:20,00:01:42,"Hello and welcome to another episode of knowsuchthingsofish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the"
00:01:42,00:01:47,"QI offices in Hoburn. My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, James"
00:01:47,00:01:51,"Harkin and Andrew Hunter Murray. And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:01:51,00:01:56,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days. And in no particular order, here"
00:01:56,00:02:02,"we go. Starting with fact number one, that is Andy. My fact is that Venice's most famous"
00:02:02,00:02:09,bridge was built by a man named Antonio the Bridge. What's it? What's it? Yes. What's
00:02:09,00:02:15,"it? What's it? Is it Rialto? It's the Rialto Bridge, which is the biggie. Yeah. It's not"
00:02:15,00:02:22,"the biggest, but it is the famous one, most venerable. And the builder was Antonio D'Aponte,"
00:02:22,00:02:26,which certain members of this podcast have pointed out might mean Antonio Orville from
00:02:26,00:02:31,the bridge. It just doesn't mean Antonio the Bridge. Lame. Lame. Can't a fellow have a little
00:02:31,00:02:35,"flair on this podcast. We don't want to alienate the Italian listeners. Well, this was sent"
00:02:35,00:02:41,in by Marco Batuzzo as originally wanted. So I think he will be pretty alienated by you
00:02:41,00:02:49,"now. So thanks to Marco for sending us in. This is about Venice. La Serenissima, you know."
00:02:49,00:02:55,"City of canals. That doesn't sound very sexy, does it? Queen of the Adriatic. That sounds"
00:02:55,00:03:02,sexy. Yeah. The floating city. Yes. Scondolas. It smells quite like shit. Does it? For a
00:03:02,00:03:05,"lot of the year. Really? Yeah. Have you guys been to Venice? Yeah. Lots of pigeons, I seem"
00:03:05,00:03:10,"to remember. There was in St. Mark's Square, is it? Pigeon St. Mark's Square. But yeah,"
00:03:10,00:03:16,"for a lot of the year, the effluence sort of backs up and it does smell pretty whiffy."
00:03:16,00:03:19,You and I should take charge of their tourist industry. You could really stole a lot of
00:03:19,00:03:24,"their properties. They're trying to put people off, aren't they? Yeah. Anyway, Antonio D'Aponte"
00:03:24,00:03:28,designed the Rialto and this actually gets to another fact. I've been trying to smuggle
00:03:28,00:03:32,"into this podcast for some months now, which is the Canaletto, the man most famous for"
00:03:32,00:03:37,"painting all the canals in Venice, was born Giovanni Canal, John Canal was his name and"
00:03:37,00:03:41,then he painted canals for a living. And these guys didn't think that was a good fact. I
00:03:41,00:03:45,think it's a good fact. I just thought he was more well known than Antonio off the
00:03:45,00:03:49,"bridge. Yeah, true. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's weird that we don't seem to know much"
00:03:49,00:03:55,about Mr. Bridge. We know his nephew had nepotism on his side because he built a bridge himself.
00:03:55,00:04:01,"This was the bridge of size. Oh, that's the second most famous one in Venice. We'll get"
00:04:01,00:04:04,"back to your bridge, Andy, but that bridge was called that because it was the last site"
00:04:04,00:04:08,that prisoners would see before they would then put into a building. So the idea was
00:04:08,00:04:16,"the sigh would be, oh, this is it. Supposedly... What a shit bridge to end on. Supposedly Byron"
00:04:16,00:04:21,"gave it the name, the bridge of size. Really? We don't know his nepotism. He might have"
00:04:21,00:04:24,just been a naturally good bridge builder like his uncle. Absolutely true. Can you tell
00:04:24,00:04:28,us any more about Antonio or not? I've only got one thing about Antonio D'Aponte. So
00:04:28,00:04:33,it was 1591. He's designing it. And there is a legend that he made a deal with the devil.
00:04:33,00:04:37,"Oh, is that true? It's one of those, is it? It's one of those. Wow. And the bridge would be a success,"
00:04:37,00:04:41,"but in exchange, the devil would claim the soul of the first person who crossed the bridge."
00:04:41,00:04:45,"Actually, I would say that's quite a good deal for him because usually it's the person who designs"
00:04:45,00:04:50,"it who has to give their soul away. Exactly, exactly that. And he tried to trick the devil"
00:04:50,00:04:54,by making a rooster walk over the bridge first. That never works. The devil sees through that
00:04:54,00:04:58,kind of shit. The devil saw through it and then ensured that the first human to cross was D'Aponte's
00:04:58,00:05:04,"own wife. Uh-oh. Oh, he then died. He read it after the rooster. Do we know anything about her?"
00:05:04,00:05:11,"No. Did she die? Did she die? She's not still alive. I mean, I don't think the story is..."
00:05:11,00:05:15,I don't think we need to... Not true. I don't think we need to dig into that story.
00:05:15,00:05:19,"There's quite a few legends about it, isn't there? So this was the fourth bridge that was"
00:05:19,00:05:24,built in this spot. It's not the fourth bridge. Is that an actual bridge? That's in Scotland.
00:05:24,00:05:28,"That's in Scotland, of course. So there were previous bridges and it was going to cost a lot,"
00:05:28,00:05:34,a lot of money. And there's a story that goes that a couple who were talking to the government
00:05:34,00:05:38,"who were financing it, they said, ""This is an impossible feat. It's going to collapse. It's"
00:05:38,00:05:45,"not going to work. If it happens, I, to God, let a nail grow out between my thighs,"" said the man."
00:05:45,00:05:52,"And the lady said, ""Yes, and let a fire burn my vagina."" And she said, ""A fire should burn my"
00:05:52,00:05:56,"nature."" But that's what she was talking about. Now, if you look on the bridge, there are two"
00:05:56,00:06:00,facades where there is a lady with a fire in between her legs and there's a man with a sort
00:06:00,00:06:05,"of third leg that's coming out. And supposedly it's in connection to that legend. I think it is,"
00:06:05,00:06:08,"isn't it? Yeah. Even though that probably didn't happen. But you know, it was a, like, screw you,"
00:06:08,00:06:13,middle finger to the people who said it would never happen. Because it took almost 100 years
00:06:13,00:06:16,"to be built from when it was promised. So the whole of Venice, it was a joke that no one was"
00:06:16,00:06:20,ever going to build it. So they did do that sculpture as a middle finger. But I feel like
00:06:20,00:06:24,"the man got off lightly because, A, he said, ""Let a nail grow between my thighs."" And it's not a"
00:06:24,00:06:28,"nail, it's a leg. It's a leg. He got a third leg. So you just got a third leg. That's almost an asset."
00:06:28,00:06:33,"Well, I'm not sure. You wouldn't say no to a third leg, would you? I think I would, actually,"
00:06:33,00:06:38,because I think it's associated with certain entertainers from the 1970s that I wouldn't
00:06:38,00:06:45,"want to be associated with. Okay. Well, there's no good on that bridge. So can I ask the previous"
00:06:45,00:06:51,"bridges? So this is the fourth one, the realtor, right? Yeah. Were they all wooden and burned down"
00:06:51,00:06:57,or something or what? A wolf came and huffed and huffed. They were kind of omitted. They were
00:06:57,00:07:04,often replaced for reasons like we need to get ships along this bit of the lagoon or the lake
00:07:04,00:07:08,"or the canal or whatever. And actually, it's too tall. So one of the previous ones was the draw"
00:07:08,00:07:12,"bridge. Oh, really? Great fun. But I think they wanted something a bit more permanent. So previous"
00:07:12,00:07:17,"times that this bridge went down, one was it was burnt down as part of a revolt. And then the next"
00:07:17,00:07:23,"time, the rebuilt one, which was in 1444, collapsed because a crowd of people were running to the"
00:07:23,00:07:29,marriage of the Marquis of Ferrara. And the weight couldn't take it. And so it just collapsed. Wow.
00:07:29,00:07:36,Obviously the Marquis of it sounded like you were just clearing your throat at the double ARA.
00:07:36,00:07:41,"Ah, what famous thing about the bridges in Venice is they used to fight over them a lot,"
00:07:41,00:07:46,"didn't they? And when I say fight over them, I mean, they were walking over them. It's mine! It's mine!"
00:07:46,00:07:51,It's mine! It was like families and they used to just have big old scraps over the bridges.
00:07:51,00:07:58,"Yeah, sounds like such a fun era. Yeah. It was a particular day. You'd go to a bridge on a day"
00:07:58,00:08:01,and there would be the day of fighting. You know what? I think it happened quite regularly.
00:08:01,00:08:06,"But yeah, like it would be an Easter thing or a special day of the year. It was just fistfights."
00:08:06,00:08:10,Just fistfights. And they weren't really fighting over anything in particular. It wasn't like we
00:08:10,00:08:15,want this bridge like Anna says. It was just like we want honour. So it'll make everyone in our family
00:08:15,00:08:21,"like us if we win this fight. Yeah, I think it was originally started with the two massive factions,"
00:08:21,00:08:25,"which kind of split Venice, the Castellani, who were the shipbuilders and the sailors and the"
00:08:25,00:08:29,"Niccolotti who were the fishermen. And you know, they just hated each other. So they came and"
00:08:29,00:08:34,they had some stick fights for a while. And then I think they decided to convert to fists.
00:08:34,00:08:40,"And it only ended in 1705. So it started in 14th century, happened all the time. Always a bridge"
00:08:40,00:08:46,"you can find somewhere with a fight on it. And in 1705, when one fight got so big and so popular"
00:08:46,00:08:52,that the San Girolamo church somewhere else in the city caught fire and was going to burn down.
00:08:52,00:08:57,And they relied on firemen volunteers to come and fix it. But all the firemen volunteers were
00:08:57,00:09:02,watching this fight and refused. And so this amazing church burned down because these lazy
00:09:02,00:09:06,firemen were too busy at the fight. You do wonder what happened in the past with it being fights
00:09:06,00:09:11,between the shipbuilders and the fishermen. Because they must get together quite often for
00:09:11,00:09:15,"business, right? Oh, yeah, you're right. You want someone to build you a ship. Exactly. The fishermen"
00:09:15,00:09:21,depend on the shipbuilders. And the shipbuilders depend on the fishermen to buy their boats.
00:09:21,00:09:24,Why are they alienating each other? It's not good business.
00:09:24,00:09:28,"That's just rivalry, isn't it? It's like us and the Big Bang Theory, you know? Like,"
00:09:28,00:09:32,"we're all part of this great comedy world, but we're daggers drawn."
00:09:32,00:09:33,"Oh, yeah, they really care about us."
00:09:33,00:09:37,"With hindsight, I should have set off menu."
00:09:37,00:09:42,"Yeah, we say people who we've actually met and are still going."
00:09:44,00:09:51,"Dad, we won. We defeated the Big Bang Theory. So obvious. I was looking up other notable people"
00:09:51,00:09:56,from Venice. And specifically people whose names sounded like the thing that they did. Found an
00:09:56,00:10:04,"archaeologist called Iocomo Boni. Brilliant. Unfortunately, he was an archaeologist of"
00:10:04,00:10:08,"Roman architecture, as opposed to finding bones. But he must have come across some bones when"
00:10:08,00:10:12,"he was doing that stuff. He would have cleared some bones out the way, yeah. And that's the only one"
00:10:12,00:10:16,I found. That was really good. How long did that couple of days work?
00:10:16,00:10:22,"I actually lost a lot of time because Leonardo da Vinci is of Vinci. And I thought, okay,"
00:10:22,00:10:27,where is Antonio the bridge from? So I looked up bridge and there's a few places around the world
00:10:27,00:10:32,"called bridge, but none in Italy. And I thought, oh my God, so where is he from? Now, after about"
00:10:32,00:10:36,"half an hour, I realized... You searched the word bridge, not ponte."
00:10:38,00:10:41,So I've got a lot of facts about little villages called bridge around the UK.
00:10:41,00:10:46,"You didn't give us some of them, that's great. Well, there's one in Canterbury, near Canterbury,"
00:10:46,00:10:53,"called bridge, population 1500. Its only cultural milestone for it is that it was once featured"
00:10:53,00:10:57,"in a show called Robby the Car, in which bridges traffic congested roads were shown. That's the"
00:10:57,00:11:02,only popular cultural reference that it has ever had. And do we mean Robby the Car or Robby of the
00:11:02,00:11:09,"Car? Robby the Car. And don't fall for it. But ponte, there are lots of pantes, it turns out,"
00:11:09,00:11:16,"when I re-googled it in Italy, but we also have a ponte in the UK. Ponte Pritt. We've got ponte"
00:11:16,00:11:21,"Fract. Ponte Fract, which literally means broken bridge. Broken bridge. Yes, why does it mean that?"
00:11:21,00:11:27,"I'm not talking about that. I stopped researching it, but it was... You'd gone off course at this point."
00:11:27,00:11:31,"Someone quite famous, there was a bridge that was broken and they rebuilt it. And so we got its"
00:11:31,00:11:36,name off the back of it a very long time ago. Nice. There we go. There's the detail you needed.
00:11:36,00:11:41,"I didn't know this, maybe it's very well known if you've been to Venice, but it's obviously in the"
00:11:41,00:11:46,middle of this lagoon. Do you know the average depth of the lagoon? It's going to be either 90
00:11:46,00:11:50,"centimetres or it's going to be too wild. I think it's really shallow. It's one meter,"
00:11:50,00:11:55,"half fridge depth, one meter. Wow. And it varies quite a lot, but you have to, if you are in a"
00:11:55,00:11:59,"boat, you really need to know the right route, otherwise you are going to get beach, but basically"
00:11:59,00:12:03,"you could puddle across the time. Do people swim across? No, they don't. They really don't. And"
00:12:03,00:12:06,"people say, you know, even foreigners are not recommended to boat across because you won't"
00:12:06,00:12:11,"be able to navigate it. Because unlike the channel swim that people do, if you get tired,"
00:12:11,00:12:15,"you drown, but in this one you could literally stand and just fake that you're still with the front"
00:12:15,00:12:20,"floor. It's still going. That's how I swam till I was about 11 years old. When you were there,"
00:12:20,00:12:25,"you've been there. I've been there a few times. Yeah, when I was very young. Did you go in the"
00:12:25,00:12:31,"gondolas? Yeah. And did you have a maestro on board singing? Oh no. Because they don't sing,"
00:12:31,00:12:36,"I believe, the gondolas. I always didn't. No. I think you have to. Actually, I was quite taciturn"
00:12:36,00:12:40,"thinking about it. Right. Well, I think they are because they're really busy punting you along."
00:12:40,00:12:45,"It's really high effort. Like you'd have to be tailors. I was going to sing. Sing, damn it."
00:12:45,00:12:49,"They get a bit snippy when you ask them to sing. And I read an interview with a gondola who said,"
00:12:49,00:12:58,"yes, we know if anyone sings just one connetto that they're British. But there are only about 430"
00:12:58,00:13:04,proper gondoliers in the city. The gondolas are a very specific kind of boat. And there are also
00:13:04,00:13:09,"the trageti, which are like bus gondolas, which go, there are more like ferries across waterways."
00:13:09,00:13:13,"I just remembered, I have been in a gondola where they were singing. Oh, really? Yeah. And they were"
00:13:13,00:13:18,"singing, oh, so let me or not. Just one connetto. Just one connetto. Yeah. But the effect is the same."
00:13:18,00:13:24,"And that was in Las Vegas. Because there is like the, is it called the Venetian? Maybe it is."
00:13:24,00:13:29,"One of the hotels, they have like gondoliers on the outside. Yeah, yeah. They all lean a little"
00:13:29,00:13:34,"bit to the right, don't they? The gondolas? The gondolas, yes. Politically, you mean? Yes,"
00:13:34,00:13:40,"they're all very, very Republican. That's that. No, I don't know their political leanings,"
00:13:40,00:13:45,"but their physical leanings to the right, every gondola is exactly 24 centimeters longer on its"
00:13:45,00:13:50,"left hand side, so that the keel bends round to the right and it tilts a bit to the right."
00:13:50,00:13:54,"Why? It's because it's kind of like, if you imagine you're punting, but the gondoliers punt"
00:13:54,00:13:59,"on one side, they row from the right side. And so if they were on the right side and it was straight,"
00:13:59,00:14:04,"then it would keep veering to the left. Yeah, that's clever. That's clever. It's all wonky."
00:14:04,00:14:09,"We haven't even talked about the doge. Oh, that's the guy who ran it. Is it a charge?"
00:14:09,00:14:14,"Yeah, or she, but mostly guys. Was there ever a female doge? I believe not. But the doge is"
00:14:14,00:14:19,they lasted for the Republic lasted a thousand years until Napoleon came along and just ended
00:14:19,00:14:24,"it like that. Yeah, we're sad. Do you know who was instrumental in the restoration of the doge"
00:14:24,00:14:32,"palace? Iocomo Boni. Archaeologist, yeah. He was very much involved in that."
00:14:32,00:14:43,"Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact. My fact this week is that,"
00:14:43,00:14:48,"for the last seven years, a science lab in Italy has continuously been looking for"
00:14:48,00:14:55,something that supposedly happens less than once every trillion trillion years. It's very cool.
00:14:55,00:15:02,"Is it you making the tea? What? I just, I thought one of us had to have come out"
00:15:02,00:15:05,with a joke in advance for that and none of us had. And I can see it hadn't happened.
00:15:05,00:15:09,"So that was a prepped joke as well. No, that was on the fly. I suddenly realized"
00:15:09,00:15:12,"we should have prepped something. Got it. Guys, why didn't you prep anything?"
00:15:12,00:15:18,"Yeah, what is this, Dan? This is the cryogenic underground observatory for rare events,"
00:15:18,00:15:25,"also known as Cura, which is heart in the Italian language. Cool. It's a particle physics experiment."
00:15:25,00:15:30,It's underground and it is trying to basically work out why it is that the universe is in the
00:15:30,00:15:35,"way it is. We are missing a lot of mass in the universe. Dark matter is not there. Scientists,"
00:15:35,00:15:39,it's one of the biggest problems. How can we not find it? I know this study. It's done by a guy
00:15:39,00:15:47,"called Giovanni Neutrino. I have a question, Dan. Yeah, yeah. If this only happens once every"
00:15:47,00:15:51,"trillion trillion years, and they've been going for seven years, are they just hoping to get"
00:15:51,00:15:55,"incredibly lucky? It's got to happen sometime, right? Even though we're living in a 14 billion"
00:15:55,00:15:59,year old universe. So what's the deal there? Are they trying to make it happen?
00:15:59,00:16:06,What is the actual thing that they're looking for? What they're looking for is they're trying to work
00:16:06,00:16:11,"out whether or not neutrinos, which they're incredibly, incredibly tiny. There's a comparative"
00:16:11,00:16:16,"which says that if an atom is the size of the solar system, the neutrino at the center is the"
00:16:16,00:16:19,"size of a golf ball. So this is an extraordinarily... Oh, no, I'm interested."
00:16:19,00:16:27,"When radiation happens, isn't it right that neutrinos are created? When radioactive molecules"
00:16:27,00:16:33,decay? Yes. So I think basically what they're really excited about finding here is a decay that
00:16:33,00:16:38,"doesn't spit out neutrinos, right? Neutrino-less decay. So the idea is that when atoms decay,"
00:16:38,00:16:42,"they spit out two electrons. Sometimes they spit out two electrons, two neutrinos,"
00:16:42,00:16:46,"and scientists have gone for ages. We reckon that sometimes atoms decay, and the two neutrinos that"
00:16:46,00:16:51,"would be spat out will actually erase each other, because one will be a neutrino, one will become"
00:16:51,00:16:55,"an anti-neutrino, and nothing will be spat out. And this will answer all our questions about why"
00:16:55,00:16:58,there's so little antimatter in the universe. But I don't know if they found it yet.
00:17:00,00:17:04,"I think we would have heard if they had. No, they haven't found it yet."
00:17:04,00:17:08,"And the way that they can do it in seven years, or not do it yet in seven years,"
00:17:08,00:17:14,"but they're hoping to do it sometime, is just they have a lot of stuff, right? So it would"
00:17:14,00:17:18,"happen to an individual molecule once every trillion, trillion years. But if you've got a"
00:17:18,00:17:22,"trillion, trillion molecules, then it'll happen every year. I understand. I mean..."
00:17:22,00:17:25,"Oh, so it only happens less than once every trillion, trillion years to each molecule,"
00:17:25,00:17:30,"kind of thing, right not ever in the universe. And so they're observing it in this incredible"
00:17:30,00:17:35,refrigerator that they've built. It's called the cryostat. And it basically...
00:17:35,00:17:39,Would they keep milk in this refrigerator? You probably would know where milk is kept.
00:17:39,00:17:48,"Basically, the idea... Let's get back to the physics guys. So the refrigerator takes the"
00:17:48,00:17:54,"temperature down to what is called 10 millikelvin, which is just barely above absolute zero."
00:17:54,00:17:59,And the conditions are basically colder than the coldest spot of space. It went out to the
00:17:59,00:18:04,coldest bit of the void of the space. This is colder. So it's a pretty amazing thing going on.
00:18:04,00:18:07,It's amazing we can create the coldest spot in the universe.
00:18:07,00:18:12,"Yeah, it really is. And the other amazing thing about is about where this thing is,"
00:18:12,00:18:16,"because if you're trying to study neutrinos, you want to avoid cosmic bombardment."
00:18:16,00:18:20,"Oh yeah. Because there's neutrinos going around all the time, right?"
00:18:20,00:18:24,"Constantly. They're everywhere. So if you're looking for them, that's going to be tough,"
00:18:24,00:18:29,"because they're everywhere. They're in you, they're in your cup of tea that Dan didn't make."
00:18:29,00:18:33,They're everywhere. So you need to create an environment where they aren't.
00:18:33,00:18:38,"Exactly. And so what they do, they go beneath a mountain range, which helps."
00:18:38,00:18:42,"But another layer of protection they've got is, and this is something we've mentioned a few years"
00:18:42,00:18:50,"ago, ancient Roman ingots of lead, which were found in a 2000 year old shipwreck. And they"
00:18:50,00:18:54,"gained the permission to use these for science rather than putting them in a museum, I guess"
00:18:54,00:18:58,"because they're 2000 year old lumps of lead, who cares. But they've been at the bottom of the"
00:18:58,00:19:02,"ocean all this time, so they haven't absorbed any cosmic bombardment. So they're relatively clean."
00:19:02,00:19:10,"And that has been, they've been melted down and formed into a shield to protect these towers of"
00:19:10,00:19:15,"fridge units, basically. Yeah. Crystals, which are making the place so cold. So it's surrounded by"
00:19:15,00:19:20,"2000 year old Roman lead shield. It's a pile, isn't it? It's just under a mountain in Italy,"
00:19:20,00:19:25,like it's mad. It's James Bond stuff. It is. And it's the coldest cubic meter in the universe.
00:19:25,00:19:29,"Like that's just, that is the final cherry on the top. It's just nuts. And the Romans helped"
00:19:29,00:19:34,"to build it as if they didn't take credit for everything else. I mean, neutrinos have been"
00:19:34,00:19:40,"causing problems for scientists for a while, haven't they? Since we imagine they might exist,"
00:19:40,00:19:45,"people tried to look for them for ages. And because they're so tiny and charge-less,"
00:19:45,00:19:49,"and they don't interact with anything at all, they're almost totally undetectable. So I think"
00:19:49,00:19:54,"Wolfgang Pauli in 1930, when he said, I think neutrinos must exist, immediately said,"
00:19:54,00:19:59,I've done a terrible thing. I have postulated a particle that cannot be detected. I felt really
00:19:59,00:20:05,bad about it. But they did find it 26 years later. And this was two scientists called Rains and Cowan
00:20:05,00:20:09,in 1956. Do you know what their original plan was for how to find a neutrino?
00:20:09,00:20:17,"Here, neutrino. Here, here, neutrino. It's a whistle. Yeah. What was happening in the 1950s?"
00:20:17,00:20:21,"So there were some big experiments going on in America. Yeah, nuclear bombs. Yeah."
00:20:21,00:20:26,"They were like, let's set off a nuclear bomb since it's happening anyway. And they went to the US"
00:20:26,00:20:30,"government and they said, do you mind if we set off a nuclear bomb about the same size as the one"
00:20:30,00:20:36,in Hiroshima? And then we'll plant a neutrino detector near it and it'll detect stuff. And
00:20:36,00:20:38,that was what they were going to do. And it was only at the last minute they thought actually a
00:20:38,00:20:45,"nuclear reactor would be easier. They used that. Yeah, Pauli, by the way, was in Friend of the"
00:20:45,00:20:54,"Podcast, the smartest ever photograph. He was one of those guys and he won a Nobel Prize a bit"
00:20:54,00:20:59,later for bombarding uranium with neutrons and creating two new elements called Ocenium and
00:20:59,00:21:06,"Hesperium. I mean, do you guys know those elements? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Well, they don't exist. It turns"
00:21:06,00:21:10,"out that he'd made a huge mistake. And even though he won Nobel Prize for it, those two elements"
00:21:10,00:21:14,"don't exist. Do they then take the Nobel Prize back? No, they didn't. Because all the work was"
00:21:14,00:21:19,"very important, what he was doing, what he'd actually done. And the only found out this way"
00:21:19,00:21:25,"later is that he'd actually split the atom. And what he'd made was not Ocenium and Hesperium,"
00:21:25,00:21:29,"but it was a mixture of barium, krypton, and a load of other elements that he got from splitting"
00:21:29,00:21:34,the atom. Really? Yeah. It turned out he'd done something even more important. I love these stories.
00:21:34,00:21:40,Turns out the atom was split by mistake. Someone was walking across the lab with a tray and they
00:21:40,00:21:48,"tried to cut some carrots in the kitchen. You know, so neutrinos are everywhere, as we've said."
00:21:48,00:21:53,"And they don't get, they don't change course. So they're good at being traced back. You can cut,"
00:21:53,00:21:57,"if you can trace the direction of a neutrino, which is obviously very hard to do, you can just say,"
00:21:57,00:22:02,"""Oh, look, it comes from that supernova over there."" Because they're not affected by like gravity or"
00:22:02,00:22:06,"anything like that. Like anything at all? They pass because they're so tiny. They pass through,"
00:22:06,00:22:09,"if they, like if they put a hundred million, no, sorry, hang on one second. Oh, I can tell you"
00:22:09,00:22:14,"how many. Okay, great. If you listen to the song ""Bound for the Reload"" by Oxide and Neutrino,"
00:22:14,00:22:20,"the garage act. Brilliant song. I love it. Number one, with a casualty theme tune in the background."
00:22:20,00:22:27,"Exactly. Yeah. In the time it takes you to listen to that song, 2.27 quadrillion neutrinos will have"
00:22:27,00:22:31,"passed through your body. Have you listened to that song? I've listened to half of it. Oh,"
00:22:31,00:22:35,"so how many neutrinos passed through your body before you gave up? Only about a quadrillion,"
00:22:35,00:22:41,"then I thought, you know what? It's not for me. But what's weird apparently is they're so tiny that"
00:22:41,00:22:45,"as they're passing through you, they don't make contact with the neutrinos that they're in the"
00:22:45,00:22:49,atoms of your body. It only happens like once or twice in your lifetime. But if you threw a golf
00:22:49,00:22:54,"ball through the solar system, it wouldn't hit another. So is that astonishing? A neutrino could"
00:22:54,00:23:02,"go through lead for a light year of distance and not hit a single atom on the way. Solid lead,"
00:23:02,00:23:08,crazy. It's just mad. It's just mad things. And there's an argument to say. What's the point
00:23:08,00:23:11,in studying them? Because they don't interact with anything. They don't bother anyone. But
00:23:11,00:23:18,"they were really, really essential in one specific period. And that was the lepton epoch. So they're"
00:23:18,00:23:23,"a type of lepton, just type of particle. Do you guys know how long the lepton epoch lasted? Again,"
00:23:23,00:23:29,it's either going to be an 18th of a millisecond or it's going to be five. I have a feeling it might
00:23:29,00:23:32,have been less than an 18th of a millisecond. Was it at the very start of the universe? It was
00:23:32,00:23:37,the start of the universe. It wasn't quite less than that. It lasted between one to 10 seconds
00:23:37,00:23:41,after the Big Bang. That was their moment of glory. That's longer than you managed to get through
00:23:41,00:23:48,"that UK garage sun. Yeah, that was when they were important. It was just them hanging out,"
00:23:48,00:23:53,establishing the structure of the universe. It is crazy. So these guys are looking for
00:23:53,00:24:00,"neutrino-less double-beta decay, as very well explained earlier on. But do you know who discovered"
00:24:00,00:24:07,"double-beta decay? Oh, gee. Oh. As in with all the neutrinos involved. Is it a friend of the podcast?"
00:24:07,00:24:15,"No, it's not. It's someone called Maria Gerpert-Meyer. Maria Gerpert-Meyer was, she basically took 30"
00:24:15,00:24:20,years to become a professor because she was at school and then her school closed down because
00:24:20,00:24:24,she was at school for girls and they just closed it. She was in Germany just before she was due
00:24:24,00:24:32,to graduate. When was this? This was in the middle of the 20th century. She was born in 190 something.
00:24:32,00:24:38,"And she basically, yeah, it took her ages and ages to get a professorship because basically"
00:24:38,00:24:42,"women couldn't really do it back then. And then three years after she got a professorship, she won"
00:24:42,00:24:48,"a Nobel Prize. And of all the people who were linked with the Manhattan Project, there were 30 men"
00:24:48,00:24:53,who got Nobel Prizes and she was the only woman to get a Nobel Prize for the Manhattan Project.
00:24:53,00:24:59,And she kind of came up with loads of ideas. One of them was something called spin orbit coupling.
00:24:59,00:25:06,And it's the way that particles go around orbit in atoms and stuff. And the way that she did it is
00:25:06,00:25:11,"she knew Enrico Fermi. She was like one of these people who, when she had an idea, she would just"
00:25:11,00:25:16,talk and talk and talk and talk. And it was almost like an avalanche coming over you and telling you
00:25:16,00:25:20,"what was happening. And then Enrico's like, look, it's too much. I don't understand. It's too complicated."
00:25:20,00:25:26,It's too many words. Just go away and think about it. And she came back and basically then started
00:25:26,00:25:30,dancing the waltz with him. And then her whole theory from then on was that these little things
00:25:30,00:25:35,move around the atom exactly the way that couples move when they're waltzing. And it means that
00:25:35,00:25:39,the ones on the outside move a bit slower. The ones on the inside move a bit faster and they all kind
00:25:39,00:25:43,of interact with each other in that way. Do you think it was that? Or did you just spend
00:25:43,00:25:47,"ages and ages studying it and then think, I've got to come up with some sort of romantic"
00:25:47,00:25:52,revelatory moment for Fermi. Maybe. Get on the dance floor. For the inevitable biopic.
00:25:52,00:25:57,"Yes. It kind of more felt like Fermi didn't really understand it. It was like, this is like the"
00:25:57,00:26:01,most advanced physics at the time and still is pretty advanced now. So it was her actually
00:26:01,00:26:06,"dumbing it down for him. I think so, yeah. Come on, Fermi. It's good that people were doing the waltz"
00:26:06,00:26:11,"at the time. As in, you know, modern dancers don't really rely on that kind of. If you were bouncing"
00:26:11,00:26:16,"to oxide a new tree, no. Just chaos. Yeah. We've never know. We've never discovered."
00:26:16,00:26:19,"Actually, on particle spin, this is something I don't think we've mentioned before, but it is"
00:26:19,00:26:25,amazing if people don't know it. The whole universe is left-handed. We're all on a massive gondola.
00:26:25,00:26:34,"So what does that mean? Which basically means that there are certain interactions,"
00:26:34,00:26:40,"weak interactions involving this weak force, which is what radioactive decay involves,"
00:26:40,00:26:46,"where all the neutrinos involved spin clockwise, which means they're left-handed and it's in lots"
00:26:46,00:26:52,"of stuff. So all proteins that create life, the amino acids are lefty. So the amino acids"
00:26:52,00:26:57,"that spin clockwise. Is there an advantage to it? Like with Teth Place? Oh, you think we're like the"
00:26:57,00:27:04,Nadal universe. Exactly. We don't know. About two-thirds of galaxies spin clockwise. We don't
00:27:04,00:27:13,"really know why. It's very, very weird. That principle of weak interactions is actually what"
00:27:13,00:27:26,"the Big Bang Theory sitcom was based on. Suck it, Big Bang."
00:27:26,00:27:33,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Anna. My fact is that Siegfried Sassoon's great"
00:27:33,00:27:40,grandfather once owned half the opium in India and China. It's a lot of opium. It's so much opium.
00:27:40,00:27:45,"It was like a lot of stuff. All personal use? Yeah, definitely intent to supply,"
00:27:45,00:27:50,"isn't it, when he's pulled over? He didn't bring it all over in his bum, though, did he?"
00:27:50,00:27:56,"It wasn't stuffed up his anus, no. No, they were classier than that. I don't think it was that"
00:27:56,00:28:01,"classy the opium was. Oh, look, don't twist my words, James, to make it sound like one of our"
00:28:01,00:28:07,"lowest colonial moments. I think it was at low points of the British Empire, personally speaking."
00:28:07,00:28:11,"So what was it? Britain was owning and trading opium, like growing it in India and then selling"
00:28:11,00:28:16,"it to China and basically getting China hooked on opium. Yes, exactly. Because it's for trade,"
00:28:16,00:28:19,"for money. And then China said, please don't do that. And Britain said, all right, well, we're"
00:28:19,00:28:23,going to go to war then. Right. Because we're going to make this up. And they had a big old war.
00:28:23,00:28:28,"Then Britain said, well, we're going to keep Hong Kong. And so then we kept Hong Kong. And then"
00:28:28,00:28:35,"Dan was born. That's the story. If you read my bio online, that's my origin story. Wow."
00:28:35,00:28:39,Do you feel guilty? Do you feel partially responsible for the subjugation of China?
00:28:39,00:28:44,Absolutely. It's why I don't make tea for anyone. I don't want to get any British tradition.
00:28:44,00:28:51,"That was a very good joke for anyone unfamiliar with the opium wars, because the whole point was"
00:28:51,00:28:55,China was exporting so much tea to us. And we needed to export something back to sort the
00:28:55,00:29:00,"trade deficit. And we found opium. Anyway, this assumes, were they responsible, weren't they?"
00:29:00,00:29:09,"Well, complicit. Yes. So they were a massive Jewish Iraqi family originally in the 18th century,"
00:29:09,00:29:15,"and much earlier. And there was this guy, Sheikh Sassoon Ben Salah, who was basically the treasurer"
00:29:15,00:29:18,to all the highest ranking politicians in Baghdad. He was like the treasurer of Baghdad.
00:29:18,00:29:25,And then Jews started being persecuted very badly in Iraq in the early 1800s. And so the family
00:29:25,00:29:31,"fled. And this guy called David Sassoon, his son, fled to Bombay with, I think he had something like"
00:29:31,00:29:36,"18 children, something like that. 14, 14 children, still quite a lot. So they got to Bombay, they"
00:29:36,00:29:40,were very successful. They traded lots of things. They allied with the British empire who were doing
00:29:40,00:29:46,"quite well in India back then, obviously. And it was around this time when the opium wars were"
00:29:46,00:29:50,happening. And Britain was realising how valuable opium was and how much money they could make
00:29:50,00:29:55,"trading with China. And the Sassoon's caught on to that. And they got so big, they literally owned"
00:29:55,00:29:59,"half of the opium, which I actually don't know who owned the other half, but yeah."
00:29:59,00:30:04,"Some other company, I guess. So that means Siegfried basically is a nepo baby, right?"
00:30:04,00:30:09,"Oh, 100%. Yeah. Yeah. Should we say who Siegfried Sassoon is?"
00:30:09,00:30:14,"Oh, we should. Yeah. Because not everyone will have had the same British education."
00:30:14,00:30:20,"So Siegfried Sassoon, one of Britain's great war poets. First World War, he was in the First"
00:30:20,00:30:27,"World War and he lived from 1886 to 1967. So he survived the war spoiler, but he wrote some"
00:30:27,00:30:31,"cracking poems along the way. And yeah, he's a pretty famous name in the UK."
00:30:31,00:30:34,"He's huge. Definitely. We all have to study him at school. Yeah, exactly."
00:30:34,00:30:37,"And all the other war poets like Wilfred Owen and... Exactly. Yeah, yeah."
00:30:37,00:30:42,"If you think of a famous war poem and you wonder who it's by, it's always by Wilfred Owen."
00:30:42,00:30:46,It is. Because Andy and I were talking before this about which Siegfried Sassoon poems we know.
00:30:46,00:30:51,"And everyone I listed, Andy was like, ""No, that's Wilfred Owen. He did the biggies."""
00:30:51,00:30:57,"Well, he was his mentor, wasn't he? They both met in a hospital that was looking after them,"
00:30:57,00:31:02,"after they suffered some major shock from the war. And Wilfred Owen came up and said,"
00:31:02,00:31:07,"""I write poetry as well. Would you have a look?"" And he saw potential and he was a mentor to him."
00:31:07,00:31:11,"And then now he's eclipsed him. And then a bit later, they met Robert Graves,"
00:31:11,00:31:16,"who was the other really, really big war poet. And we only recently found out where they met."
00:31:16,00:31:19,"We knew it was somewhere in Scotland, but we didn't know where. And the University of"
00:31:19,00:31:23,Aberdeen lecturer called Neil McLennan found out that it was actually at a place called
00:31:23,00:31:31,"Baberton Golf Club. Oh, gosh. Oh, gosh. The old James Google search. Insert word, insert golf."
00:31:31,00:31:35,"Siegfried Sassoon loved golf. It turned out, yeah."
00:31:35,00:31:40,"One of his poems called David Cleek Goes to Saint St. Angel's Hymn Forevermore,"
00:31:40,00:31:47,The Miracle of Yara Stounding Score. Not one of his best. Was this before or after
00:31:47,00:31:51,his war poetry? Do we know? He probably had shell shock at this stage.
00:31:51,00:31:56,"Well, he was writing poetry from before the war. You know, he grew up very affluent,"
00:31:56,00:32:00,obviously. But he was already a poet. He sent a lot of early poems to Cricket magazine.
00:32:00,00:32:06,"Oh, yeah. Just to Cricket as magazine. And in the war, so the first three years of the war,"
00:32:06,00:32:11,"when he got a commission as a lieutenant, he was extremely brave. He was recommended for"
00:32:11,00:32:16,"the Victoria Cross at one point. He won, I think, the Military Cross. But he did nearly"
00:32:16,00:32:22,"suicidal things to rescue wounded men who were left out in no man's land, things like that."
00:32:22,00:32:25,"Apparently, he single-handedly acquired a German trench."
00:32:25,00:32:29,"Yeah, crazy. And then he just sat there apparently reading poems. And then he came back."
00:32:29,00:32:35,"Well, Mad Jack was his name, right? Yeah, he was labelled that."
00:32:35,00:32:39,I couldn't see the point in the German trench thing. And I probably should have looked. But
00:32:39,00:32:42,"basically, he acquired this trench, as you say. And he did it with..."
00:32:42,00:32:47,"Captured. Yeah, drove away like 60 Germans so soon you were quiet."
00:32:47,00:32:50,"Anyway, my question is, when he got there, what was the point? Because then he went back to the"
00:32:50,00:32:54,trench. And I think all the Germans just came back into the trench that he scared them out of.
00:32:54,00:32:59,And his commanding officers were very annoyed because a bit of an attack had had to be delayed
00:32:59,00:33:02,"or called off because they said, oh, there's this weird bulge in the line because Sassoon has done"
00:33:02,00:33:05,something extremely brave. And I think that's why he didn't win the Victoria Cross.
00:33:05,00:33:09,"Because like you say, he was nominated and it was for this thing that he was nominated,"
00:33:09,00:33:13,"but he didn't win it. Actually, he did a quite pointless thing and jeopardised another operation."
00:33:13,00:33:19,"Incredibly brave. But he became very disillusioned with the war, as lots of soldiers did. And he"
00:33:19,00:33:23,wrote a letter saying that the war was being deliberately prolonged and really blaming the
00:33:23,00:33:29,"generals and politicians, the English generals and politicians, and that it was being conducted"
00:33:29,00:33:33,really badly. And I think some people suggested that he should be court-martialed.
00:33:33,00:33:36,"He certainly was meant to be court-martialed. He was meant to be court-martialed. But every time,"
00:33:36,00:33:42,"yeah, he was so gung-ho that he took a bullet to the neck, but it missed the main artery,"
00:33:42,00:33:47,"so he survived. He almost had his head blown off. I think his nihilism, when I was reading about it,"
00:33:47,00:33:52,"I was thinking that he's so pissed off, isn't he? He's just gone, ""Sod this. This is all meaningless"
00:33:52,00:33:57,"now."" Because a lot of his poems are like, ""This is all meaningless."" But he was basically, like we"
00:33:57,00:34:05,"said, a Nepo baby. Because he got all this money from his aunt, called Rachel Beer, who had married"
00:34:05,00:34:09,"well. I mean, it was a very rich family anyway, but she'd married this guy who was in charge of the"
00:34:09,00:34:14,"Observer, Frederick Beer, and she'd taken over as editor, becoming the first female editor of a"
00:34:14,00:34:19,national newspaper when she did that. But she was a Nepo editor? She was a Nepo editor. How deep does
00:34:19,00:34:24,"this Nepo thing go? Well, it goes all the way back to David Sassoon, we've established. But yeah,"
00:34:24,00:34:29,"she, and then she later purchased the Sunday Times, became editor of that as well."
00:34:29,00:34:33,Which is mad. She edited those at the same time. Really? Opposite ends of the spectrum.
00:34:33,00:34:38,"Now they are. Like in those days, the Sunday Times was just like a pamphlet, really."
00:34:38,00:34:45,"But yeah, and then she and her husband, well, basically her husband started getting these"
00:34:45,00:34:51,"headaches. I read one quote in the ODMB saying that, ""It suddenly made this mild man irritable,"
00:34:51,00:34:58,"or at times feverishly gay."" And he basically went mad. He insisted that he would have the family"
00:34:58,00:35:03,crest clipped out of his black poodles back and walk around with it all the time. And it seems
00:35:03,00:35:09,"that he probably had syphilis. And then he died, and as soon as he died, Rachel got really distraught,"
00:35:09,00:35:14,but also started succumbing from syphilis. And she started writing articles in the Observer
00:35:14,00:35:19,"and the Sunday Times about how great cannibalism is and stuff like that. Oh, really? Right. And"
00:35:19,00:35:23,"then she wrote one article in the Observer, which rambled on, rambled on. And then it just"
00:35:23,00:35:28,"said, ""Continued in the next."" And then we never heard from her again. She was committed to a"
00:35:28,00:35:34,"asylum. And that was her. But she had a shit ton of money, and she left it all to Siegfried."
00:35:34,00:35:39,"And Siegfried then could become a gentleman of pleasure, which meant he loved fox hunting."
00:35:39,00:35:45,"Yes. But he also loved golf. So pros and cons. Very interesting. His grandfather,"
00:35:45,00:35:50,so David Sassoon was his great-grandfather. His grandfather was called Sassoon Sassoon.
00:35:50,00:35:57,"No. But to be fair, he had 14 children. You're running out of ideas by then."
00:35:57,00:36:03,"It's so odd. It just feels like you put the word in the wrong box, doesn't it?"
00:36:03,00:36:05,Can I get another form? No.
00:36:05,00:36:09,"Okay. Well, can I put the first name in the surname? No."
00:36:09,00:36:15,"Well, I found a thing that was made a few years ago, which is slightly relevant to this. There's"
00:36:15,00:36:20,"an instrument maker called Steve Burnett, who a few years ago made the Sassoon violin."
00:36:20,00:36:23,I think you're going to say the Sassoon bassoon. I know.
00:36:23,00:36:24,A waste.
00:36:24,00:36:28,"In the missed opportunity of the century, he made the Sassoon violin."
00:36:28,00:36:35,It's so annoying. And it's because they'd made the Wilfred Owen violin a few years before.
00:36:35,00:36:39,"So it's a sort of well-known violin. It's beautifully made, and it's played all over"
00:36:39,00:36:44,"the world in famous orchestras and all of this kind of stuff. And rather nicely,"
00:36:44,00:36:49,the Sassoon violin was made from the same branch of the same tree as the Owen violin.
00:36:49,00:36:52,So that's kind of cool. They're united by these violins. Lovely. But I agree.
00:36:52,00:36:55,Bassoon. Sassoon bassoon. It's a no-brainer.
00:36:55,00:36:57,Owen works. You can say you're bowing with an Owen.
00:36:57,00:36:59,"Oh, very good."
00:36:59,00:37:03,Did you guys see that David Sassoon invented a pickle?
00:37:03,00:37:06,Did he? Which Sassoon is this now? Sorry.
00:37:06,00:37:09,This is the original Sassoon who fled to Bombay.
00:37:09,00:37:11,This is Captain Opium.
00:37:11,00:37:13,"Captain Opium, yeah, 1813."
00:37:13,00:37:16,"Just to give a little bit of, you know,"
00:37:16,00:37:20,"also he founded a lot of hospitals, libraries, museums, orphanages and schools."
00:37:20,00:37:23,"When you got that sweet, sweet drug money rolling in,"
00:37:23,00:37:25,"you're going to need to do some reputation laundry, aren't you?"
00:37:25,00:37:29,Yeah. So he invented a pickle before or after the opium.
00:37:29,00:37:32,"Was it like his passion project was to make a pickle, but, you know,"
00:37:32,00:37:34,he had to wait while he made loads of money off opium?
00:37:34,00:37:37,He had to earn the money. He had to earn the money to make the pickle.
00:37:37,00:37:39,"In meetings, he was like,"
00:37:39,00:37:41,so what I'm really interested in pitching is my pickle.
00:37:41,00:37:43,"And they were like, we're just like loads more opium, please."
00:37:43,00:37:48,What if we got the entirety of China addicted to pickles?
00:37:48,00:37:51,"It's a great idea, David."
00:37:51,00:37:56,We're going to continue with our order for another million kilos of opium.
00:37:56,00:38:01,"Okay. What if I say for your million kilos of opium, you get 10 free pickles?"
00:38:01,00:38:03,"Yeah, that's fine."
00:38:03,00:38:05,"We're not going to be very hungry after all that opium,"
00:38:05,00:38:07,but we will try to get around to them.
00:38:07,00:38:13,"No, this was just a thing he had on the side, and it was in fact a condiment."
00:38:13,00:38:19,"And it's amber, which is a huge deal in Iraqi cuisine and in Jewish Israeli cuisine."
00:38:19,00:38:21,It appears everywhere.
00:38:21,00:38:23,It's like the one of the national foods of Iraq.
00:38:23,00:38:28,"And basically he went to India and he thought, I love these Indian mangoes."
00:38:28,00:38:30,It was either him or a member of his family.
00:38:30,00:38:32,"And by the way, this is the story of the amber pickle."
00:38:32,00:38:34,"We don't know that this actually happened,"
00:38:34,00:38:37,but the story of the amber pickle is as soon as he invented it.
00:38:37,00:38:39,"Went to India, loved the mangoes, was like,"
00:38:39,00:38:42,"""Gotta send some of these back to my mates in Iraq, so I'm going to pickle them."""
00:38:42,00:38:46,And found a great way of pickling them that people love to this very day.
00:38:46,00:38:48,"And any Iraqi listeners we have, I'm sure,"
00:38:48,00:38:50,will be showering down on an amber right now.
00:38:50,00:38:51,"Yeah, very nice."
00:38:51,00:38:55,"Can I very quickly just mention the greatest Sassoon of them all,"
00:38:55,00:38:57,"which we've not mentioned, which is Siegfried."
00:38:57,00:38:59,"So most of his life, he was gay."
00:38:59,00:39:02,He had multiple relationships with men.
00:39:02,00:39:05,"And then out of nowhere, he gets married to a lady."
00:39:05,00:39:06,"They have a child, George Sassoon."
00:39:07,00:39:12,So George Sassoon was a guy who also became an author.
00:39:12,00:39:15,"He wrote three books, and he was quite well known"
00:39:15,00:39:17,because two of those books were pushing his belief
00:39:17,00:39:21,"that we were once visited by aliens in the ancient world,"
00:39:21,00:39:25,and that they had created a machine that invented food
00:39:25,00:39:29,that allowed for the Israelites to walk across their 40-year journey
00:39:29,00:39:31,"in the Sinai Desert, right?"
00:39:31,00:39:34,"Now, it's called ""The Manor Machine,"" his book."
00:39:34,00:39:35,"Yes, exactly."
00:39:36,00:39:38,"So according to George Sassoon,"
00:39:38,00:39:42,"there's a nuclear reactor that used to power the manor machine,"
00:39:42,00:39:45,and that was stored where else the Ark of the Covenant is.
00:39:45,00:39:48,I'm afraid we had to fade Dan out there
00:39:48,00:39:51,"because he carried on talking for another 20 minutes,"
00:39:51,00:39:52,and you really didn't need to hear that.
00:39:52,00:39:55,"Available in bookshops now, the manor machine."
00:39:55,00:40:05,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:40:05,00:40:06,and that is James.
00:40:06,00:40:09,"Okay, my fact this week is that no living person"
00:40:09,00:40:11,has ever seen Murray's plums.
00:40:11,00:40:13,Okay.
00:40:13,00:40:16,Let me carry on.
00:40:16,00:40:16,Okay.
00:40:16,00:40:19,"One man thought he saw them in 1997,"
00:40:19,00:40:21,"but they were much hairier than expected,"
00:40:21,00:40:23,so he probably saw something else.
00:40:23,00:40:28,I'm not sure how hairy my plums were in 1997 when I was 10.
00:40:28,00:40:32,That's why it was surprising.
00:40:32,00:40:33,Plums.
00:40:33,00:40:35,What about plums is a fruit?
00:40:35,00:40:36,Yes.
00:40:36,00:40:37,Andry.
00:40:37,00:40:40,So we shouldn't have researched Andy's tests for a couple of times.
00:40:40,00:40:42,I wondered what all those anonymous phone calls were.
00:40:42,00:40:46,Stop answering your wife's phone.
00:40:46,00:40:51,"Prunus Mariana, called the Murray's plum,"
00:40:51,00:40:55,"is a critically endangered shrub native to Texas,"
00:40:55,00:40:58,"and the fruits are supposedly red with white dots,"
00:40:58,00:41:00,"hairless, and with a waxy coating,"
00:41:01,00:41:04,but they're so rare that apparently no one's ever seen the fruit.
00:41:04,00:41:05,"No one living, I guess."
00:41:05,00:41:06,No one living.
00:41:06,00:41:11,"So I've read some reports saying that maybe when they were first scientifically described,"
00:41:11,00:41:12,"they were mentioned,"
00:41:12,00:41:14,"but I've looked for the first scientific description,"
00:41:14,00:41:17,"which was by Edward Palmer in 1929,"
00:41:17,00:41:18,"and he said,"
00:41:18,00:41:20,"""Although I have not seen the fruit,"
00:41:20,00:41:23,this species is so distinct in character of its inforescence
00:41:23,00:41:27,and in the pubescence from any of the plums with which I am acquainted
00:41:27,00:41:29,"that I venture to describe it as new."""
00:41:29,00:41:32,So even the guy who found it hadn't seen one.
00:41:32,00:41:35,"So maybe it might be that they don't exist,"
00:41:35,00:41:37,"but I've seen some places saying that they might exist,"
00:41:37,00:41:40,but definitely no one's seen one for a long old time.
00:41:40,00:41:42,"It could be that they reproduce with fruit suckers,"
00:41:42,00:41:45,"like underneath the roots, as in the clonal."
00:41:45,00:41:45,Right.
00:41:45,00:41:46,Could be that.
00:41:46,00:41:48,"And they're in Texas, you say."
00:41:48,00:41:48,They're in Texas.
00:41:48,00:41:50,Do we have a region of Texas?
00:41:50,00:41:51,"If we've got any listeners in Texas,"
00:41:51,00:41:53,should we ask them to look out?
00:41:53,00:41:54,"Because they must, you know, if we have a mess."
00:41:54,00:41:55,Is that going to solve it?
00:41:55,00:41:56,Is that...
00:41:56,00:41:58,I just think it's how it could be how we get ourselves on the map.
00:41:58,00:41:58,No one's looking.
00:41:58,00:41:59,"Yeah, yeah."
00:41:59,00:42:00,We've rediscovered a plum.
00:42:00,00:42:00,"Yeah, you know what?"
00:42:00,00:42:02,"There is, it is a certain place,"
00:42:02,00:42:03,but I'd never wrote down where it was.
00:42:03,00:42:04,"Okay, right."
00:42:04,00:42:06,And there was a guy called Marshall Enquist a bit later
00:42:06,00:42:08,"who wrote a paper about them,"
00:42:08,00:42:11,"and he said that he'd found this type of plum,"
00:42:11,00:42:13,and he thought it was prunus mariana.
00:42:13,00:42:18,But really what he wrote didn't sound to me like that.
00:42:18,00:42:18,Okay.
00:42:18,00:42:20,"Everywhere else, like most articles and textbooks today,"
00:42:20,00:42:23,they say mariana is its own species and no one's seen the fruit.
00:42:23,00:42:23,Wow.
00:42:23,00:42:26,"It's like the Bigfoot of the fruit world, isn't it?"
00:42:26,00:42:28,"It's sort of, it's people have claimed to have seen it,"
00:42:28,00:42:29,but we've got no solid evidence.
00:42:29,00:42:31,"If you're in Texas, how big can Texas be?"
00:42:31,00:42:32,"I'd be like, probably small."
00:42:32,00:42:33,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:42:33,00:42:35,And then have a look.
00:42:35,00:42:36,There is a place called Plum in Texas.
00:42:36,00:42:37,Is there?
00:42:37,00:42:40,"Yeah, but it's a very tiny unincorporated town,"
00:42:40,00:42:42,"and as far as I could tell, no plums."
00:42:42,00:42:43,Is there anywhere called Bridge?
00:42:43,00:42:46,"Yes, actually there is."
00:42:46,00:42:50,I think I started burying a very cold freezer
00:42:50,00:42:54,under a mountain range and bombarding it with atomic energy.
00:42:54,00:42:56,"Well, the plums unfortunately will shrink"
00:42:56,00:42:58,"under those circumstances, which makes them even harder to find."
00:42:58,00:42:59,At absolute zero.
00:42:59,00:43:02,I think your plums go to the size of a dot.
00:43:02,00:43:04,It's definitely improving at the very least.
00:43:04,00:43:05,It's blanks constant.
00:43:05,00:43:06,Plums are good.
00:43:06,00:43:07,"Yeah, they're good."
00:43:07,00:43:10,"It used to mean any kind of dried fruit, actually, plum."
00:43:10,00:43:11,Is that very odd?
00:43:11,00:43:13,"Yeah, raisins would be plums."
00:43:13,00:43:16,"Like plum pudding, which has got raisins and sultanas in,"
00:43:16,00:43:19,the plum part of that is referring to the old word for raisins.
00:43:19,00:43:22,"I always assumed that plum pudding used to contain plums,"
00:43:22,00:43:24,"and then just gradually people stopped making them,"
00:43:24,00:43:28,because all Christmas puddings used to be called plum puddings in the UK.
00:43:28,00:43:30,"And there's a food writer called Francesca Greeno,"
00:43:30,00:43:32,"who was writing about this,"
00:43:32,00:43:36,"and she reckons that when Little Jack Horner was first written,"
00:43:36,00:43:40,"which is in the 16th century, plums still meant raisin then."
00:43:40,00:43:43,"So when he stuck in his thumb and pulled out a plum,"
00:43:43,00:43:46,"apparently he pulled out a raisin, according to this writer."
00:43:46,00:43:47,Harder to get on your thumb.
00:43:47,00:43:49,"Well, you could pull out a raisin,"
00:43:49,00:43:50,but you're more like dragging it out
00:43:50,00:43:53,as opposed to shoving your thumb inside it.
00:43:53,00:43:55,"Well, I actually read that the plum wasn't a plum at all,"
00:43:55,00:43:59,it was the deeds to a mansion in a bun.
00:43:59,00:44:04,"I know, but I really like this, because there was a Jack Horner."
00:44:04,00:44:08,"I'm sorry, but the fact that James just said about a nursery rhyme,"
00:44:08,00:44:09,"""Oh, they're all made up of."""
00:44:09,00:44:16,"James was a boy who was constantly saying, ""Citation needed."""
00:44:16,00:44:21,"Well, the not real Jack Horner story,"
00:44:21,00:44:23,"which has been around for over 200 years,"
00:44:23,00:44:25,"is that there was a Jack Horner, which there really was,"
00:44:25,00:44:30,who was the steward to the abbot of Glastonbury called Richard Whiting.
00:44:30,00:44:35,"And basically, Henry VIII at the time was dissolving all the monasteries, famously."
00:44:35,00:44:40,"And Richard Whiting didn't want Henry VIII to dissolve his monastery,"
00:44:40,00:44:44,"and so he sent his steward, Jack Horner,"
00:44:44,00:44:49,to Henry VIII with a pie in which he'd hidden the deeds to 12 manor houses.
00:44:49,00:44:53,"I think it's a sort of a bribe, and on the way little Jack Horner"
00:44:53,00:44:57,"put his thumb into this pie and nicked one of those deeds for himself,"
00:44:57,00:45:01,which I believe the family did get Mel's manor.
00:45:01,00:45:04,"So that, and that's little Jack Horner popped his thumb in,"
00:45:04,00:45:07,"pulled out a plum of Mel's manor, and the family have it to this day."
00:45:07,00:45:09,"And he said, ""What a good boy am I?"""
00:45:09,00:45:10,"And he said, ""What a good boy am I?"""
00:45:10,00:45:12,"Yeah, no further questions."
00:45:12,00:45:14,"There we go with this, the story."
00:45:14,00:45:17,"A plum used to mean something desirable, like you've got a plum drop."
00:45:17,00:45:18,"Oh, that still means that."
00:45:18,00:45:19,"Yeah, yeah, exactly."
00:45:19,00:45:20,"Sorry, yeah, yeah, but it's sorry."
00:45:20,00:45:22,"What it used to mean was £100,000."
00:45:22,00:45:23,Oh.
00:45:23,00:45:26,There's a specific value in Victorian times.
00:45:26,00:45:28,"Oh, yeah, because that's a lot of money in Victorian times."
00:45:28,00:45:29,"A mega amount, yeah, yeah."
00:45:29,00:45:31,Why did it get that name?
00:45:31,00:45:32,Do we know?
00:45:32,00:45:32,I don't know.
00:45:32,00:45:35,"I think it's all connected to the plum thing being something desirable,"
00:45:35,00:45:38,but I don't know why it was exactly that value.
00:45:38,00:45:39,Yeah.
00:45:39,00:45:42,"It's nice that we've made, because we're always getting in trouble"
00:45:42,00:45:45,"for bastardising the English language, the wee modern people,"
00:45:45,00:45:48,"but we've made the word plum more pure,"
00:45:48,00:45:52,because it comes from the Latin prunus for a plum tree.
00:45:52,00:45:54,They screwed it up by the 1600s.
00:45:54,00:45:56,It meant raisins and whatever you have.
00:45:56,00:45:56,Yeah.
00:45:56,00:45:58,And now we've made it plum again.
00:45:58,00:45:59,So kind of well done us.
00:45:59,00:46:00,We've reclaimed the word plum.
00:46:00,00:46:01,"Well done, everyone."
00:46:01,00:46:01,Yeah.
00:46:01,00:46:02,Yeah.
00:46:02,00:46:03,Just do a part on the back sometime.
00:46:03,00:46:05,Pat yourself on the back if you're listening to this at home
00:46:05,00:46:07,and you've used the word plum correctly.
00:46:07,00:46:11,Plums in Japan used to be a very big thing.
00:46:11,00:46:12,"Oh, they still are."
00:46:12,00:46:14,They're like bento boxes and so on.
00:46:14,00:46:17,"But in wartime, as part of rations for soldiers,"
00:46:17,00:46:20,we're talking 1467 to 1615.
00:46:20,00:46:23,"This is what was known as the Senkoku Period, roughly."
00:46:23,00:46:24,Just roughly those numbers.
00:46:24,00:46:28,And so they got given these kind of bento boxes
00:46:28,00:46:29,and they would go out into war.
00:46:29,00:46:31,"And it had things like chili pepper,"
00:46:31,00:46:33,but they wouldn't eat the chili peppers.
00:46:33,00:46:35,"What they would do is, because it'd get really cold out there,"
00:46:35,00:46:37,they would just chew on the chili peppers
00:46:37,00:46:38,and then they would wipe it all over their butt
00:46:38,00:46:40,and all down their legs.
00:46:40,00:46:42,So they would keep them hot.
00:46:42,00:46:43,"Maybe it makes you move around, but hey,"
00:46:43,00:46:46,take it up with the Japanese from roughly 1467
00:46:46,00:46:47,to 1615.
00:46:47,00:46:49,"I just thought that like there are other parts of you,"
00:46:49,00:46:51,don't go first for the bum.
00:46:51,00:46:55,"No, chili peppers around the bum does not feel like a good."
00:46:55,00:46:57,It doesn't feel like a good idea.
00:46:57,00:47:01,I've touched my eyes after cutting chilies and it's awful
00:47:01,00:47:02,and I can only imagine.
00:47:02,00:47:05,Supposedly they would take these dried plums with them
00:47:05,00:47:08,and supposedly they'd get one each in their ration
00:47:08,00:47:10,and if they were out in the field
00:47:10,00:47:11,and they were sort of short of breath
00:47:11,00:47:13,"and they were having a pretty hard time,"
00:47:13,00:47:14,they would take it out of their lunchbox
00:47:14,00:47:16,and they wouldn't eat it.
00:47:16,00:47:17,They wouldn't taste it.
00:47:17,00:47:19,They would look at it for inspiration
00:47:19,00:47:20,because it was seen as something
00:47:20,00:47:22,that would give you hope to go on.
00:47:22,00:47:23,That's nice.
00:47:23,00:47:24,It's really interesting.
00:47:24,00:47:26,There's a lot of stuff about plums in this period
00:47:26,00:47:28,"where it's kind of, is this true?"
00:47:28,00:47:29,"Like for example, samurai swords,"
00:47:29,00:47:31,supposedly when they were being heated up
00:47:31,00:47:32,"to get the metal to the right heating,"
00:47:32,00:47:34,you would take out a dry plum
00:47:34,00:47:36,and to match the colouring of that
00:47:36,00:47:38,would show you that you've heated it to the right level.
00:47:38,00:47:40,This is all put out by big plum.
00:47:40,00:47:44,"It doesn't feel real, that's true."
00:47:44,00:47:45,Big plum is very powerful globally.
00:47:45,00:47:48,"So in the First World War,"
00:47:48,00:47:50,the Daily Telegraph ran a campaign
00:47:50,00:47:53,to get every single soldier fighting on the front.
00:47:53,00:47:55,"That was three million soldiers on the Western Front,"
00:47:55,00:47:57,a portion of plum pudding.
00:47:57,00:47:59,"Yeah, for Christmas, I guess."
00:47:59,00:48:00,"It was definitely for Christmas,"
00:48:00,00:48:02,but I do think Siegfried Sassoon
00:48:02,00:48:03,at some point would have received
00:48:03,00:48:06,his Daily Telegraph back plum pudding.
00:48:06,00:48:07,I wonder if that's where Rachel hid the deeds
00:48:07,00:48:09,to the inheritance that he got.
00:48:09,00:48:12,"Yeah, but they were a big,"
00:48:12,00:48:13,just plum pudding was so big.
00:48:14,00:48:17,The plum pudding riots of 1647 happened in Canterbury.
00:48:17,00:48:18,"That was a Christmasy thing,"
00:48:18,00:48:21,"because the Puritans were in charge at the time,"
00:48:21,00:48:23,"Oliver Cromwell and his gang,"
00:48:23,00:48:26,and their main thing was keeping shops open on Christmas Day.
00:48:26,00:48:27,"They said, you have to..."
00:48:27,00:48:29,"What, the Puritans at that?"
00:48:29,00:48:30,"Yeah, they were not celebrating it."
00:48:30,00:48:32,"It's a special day, it's not religious."
00:48:32,00:48:33,Exactly.
00:48:33,00:48:34,"And the Lord Mayor of Canterbury,"
00:48:34,00:48:37,whose name was William Bridge.
00:48:37,00:48:37,Oh.
00:48:37,00:48:38,"Yeah, William de Ponte,"
00:48:38,00:48:39,as he would have been known.
00:48:39,00:48:42,"We had a Canterbury Bridge fact earlier as well,"
00:48:42,00:48:42,and now it didn't leave.
00:48:42,00:48:44,There's a place near Canterbury called Bridge.
00:48:44,00:48:46,So maybe William Bridge was from Bridge.
00:48:46,00:48:46,Oh my God.
00:48:46,00:48:47,It's possible.
00:48:47,00:48:49,"That's likely, almost, you might say."
00:48:49,00:48:52,"Well, he was walking along the streets,"
00:48:52,00:48:55,trying to encourage shopkeepers to stay open and stay serving.
00:48:55,00:48:55,Yeah.
00:48:55,00:48:56,Because it was a Christmas Day.
00:48:56,00:48:59,They all wanted to close and go and party and all of that.
00:48:59,00:49:03,And he was thrown to the ground and muddied.
00:49:03,00:49:03,"Oh, no."
00:49:03,00:49:08,Riots were sometimes a bit gentle back in the day.
00:49:08,00:49:11,You never hear about the lighter riots.
00:49:11,00:49:12,It's so nice.
00:49:12,00:49:12,You've shared that.
00:49:12,00:49:14,Does that mean just made money?
00:49:14,00:49:15,It doesn't mean he shat himself.
00:49:15,00:49:15,Does it?
00:49:15,00:49:17,I don't believe so.
00:49:17,00:49:18,"I'm sure it was a scary time,"
00:49:18,00:49:19,but no one would blame him if he did.
00:49:19,00:49:21,Absolutely not.
00:49:21,00:49:26,"In 2001, Big Plum stepped up again"
00:49:26,00:49:30,and forced the US Food and Drug Administration
00:49:30,00:49:34,to allow them legally to call prunes dried plums.
00:49:34,00:49:36,"Prunes are dried plums, aren't they?"
00:49:36,00:49:38,"They are, yes."
00:49:38,00:49:41,"But until then, you could get a sense of prison for saying that."
00:49:41,00:49:43,"I mean, honestly, as soon as you say that,"
00:49:43,00:49:45,they'd be banging down the door.
00:49:45,00:49:47,The Plum Police.
00:49:47,00:49:50,"They've got very fetching outfits, though."
00:49:50,00:49:51,They're lovely.
00:49:51,00:49:53,"Yes, no, they are."
00:49:53,00:49:55,"So it was the truth, which is why they were allowed to do it."
00:49:55,00:49:57,But also because...
00:49:57,00:50:00,"So they were marketed as prunes, obviously,"
00:50:00,00:50:02,but prunes have a bad rep.
00:50:02,00:50:03,"Well, I think it's a good rep."
00:50:03,00:50:05,They're a great relief to many of us.
00:50:05,00:50:05,I would like to live.
00:50:05,00:50:07,"They're a bit of a sticky situation, yes."
00:50:08,00:50:10,"But their argument, what Big Plum's argument,"
00:50:10,00:50:11,"Big Prune's argument was,"
00:50:11,00:50:13,"now everyone just thinks if you're buying prunes,"
00:50:13,00:50:14,that it means you're constipated.
00:50:14,00:50:17,So they're reluctant to buy prunes.
00:50:17,00:50:19,We're going to rename them dried plums.
00:50:19,00:50:22,And did that masterful piece of disguise work?
00:50:22,00:50:24,"Yeah, but the entire country was constipated"
00:50:24,00:50:26,because they couldn't get hold of any prunes.
00:50:26,00:50:29,I don't need these dried plums.
00:50:29,00:50:32,"Do you guys remember that story of Ash,"
00:50:32,00:50:33,"who is the, for listeners,"
00:50:33,00:50:37,he's the rider of our theme tune for fish?
00:50:37,00:50:39,Which one? Which one of them any?
00:50:39,00:50:41,He was going out to a party in London
00:50:41,00:50:42,and he was really hungry
00:50:42,00:50:44,and he was nothing in the house to eat.
00:50:44,00:50:45,And so he opened up the cupboard
00:50:45,00:50:49,and there was a big bag of dried prunes.
00:50:49,00:50:53,"He ate the entire bag, got on the London Underground,"
00:50:53,00:50:56,was midway between stops
00:50:56,00:50:58,"when he felt a little ""woop"" in his tummy"
00:50:58,00:51:00,"and he went, ""That's a bit weird."""
00:51:00,00:51:01,"And then a second later,"
00:51:01,00:51:03,"shat himself completely, yeah."
00:51:03,00:51:04,"Just outside Mutshoot, wasn't it?"
00:51:06,00:51:08,That's the best.
00:51:08,00:51:10,That's the fastest London Underground diary
00:51:10,00:51:11,that I've ever heard.
00:51:11,00:51:15,"Oh dear, what happened?"
00:51:15,00:51:16,"Oh, he had to get off."
00:51:16,00:51:19,Did he go to the party still?
00:51:19,00:51:19,I'm not sure.
00:51:19,00:51:21,"No, he went into an alleyway"
00:51:21,00:51:23,"that was just outside of the station,"
00:51:23,00:51:24,called his dad.
00:51:24,00:51:25,"He said, ""Dad, I've shat myself."""
00:51:25,00:51:26,How old was he?
00:51:26,00:51:30,"He was 22, 23, called his brother Jazz"
00:51:30,00:51:31,and Jazz came with a bucket
00:51:31,00:51:34,and a cloth and some extra trousers.
00:51:34,00:51:35,"What, a bucket?"
00:51:35,00:51:36,"Yeah, because he just said it was everywhere."
00:51:36,00:51:38,Because Ash had to take off his shirt.
00:51:38,00:51:40,I think he was wearing shorts on the tube as well.
00:51:40,00:51:40,Oh no.
00:51:40,00:51:41,He took off his shirt.
00:51:41,00:51:42,Ash does wear shorts.
00:51:42,00:51:44,"I mean, you didn't used to wear on the pants either."
00:51:44,00:51:45,"Yeah, exactly."
00:51:45,00:51:50,"They probably had to close down that line for a day, I would say."
00:51:50,00:51:51,"Yeah, cross the line."
00:51:51,00:51:53,"Anyway, hey Ash, if you're listening."
00:51:53,00:51:55,"Yeah, did you authorise that story to go out?"
00:51:55,00:51:58,"So yeah, California prune bar did all this, didn't they?"
00:51:58,00:52:00,And they also came up with the idea
00:52:00,00:52:03,of adding prunes to all burgers in U.S. schools.
00:52:03,00:52:04,Really?
00:52:04,00:52:05,What? Weird.
00:52:05,00:52:06,"Yeah, so the idea was..."
00:52:06,00:52:08,"Sorry, as part of the mince mixture"
00:52:08,00:52:10,or a layer on top of the tomato.
00:52:10,00:52:12,"Oh, no, part of the mixture."
00:52:12,00:52:13,So the kids wouldn't know it was in there.
00:52:13,00:52:17,And the idea is it's a way to sort of get vegetables
00:52:17,00:52:20,into kids' diets without them knowing.
00:52:20,00:52:22,Sounds like you're trying to prank all the kids
00:52:22,00:52:24,"and make them all shit themselves in the lunch room,"
00:52:24,00:52:24,doesn't it?
00:52:24,00:52:26,"Well, you know, they did it."
00:52:26,00:52:26,They did it.
00:52:26,00:52:27,They did it.
00:52:27,00:52:28,"Yeah, it was a big thing."
00:52:28,00:52:30,"It was called prune the fat, they called it."
00:52:30,00:52:30,Nice.
00:52:30,00:52:34,And the USDA bought 10 million pounds worth of prunes.
00:52:35,00:52:38,In 2003 to put into school lunches.
00:52:38,00:52:39,Really? Wow.
00:52:39,00:52:42,And the whole project finished in about 2006
00:52:42,00:52:46,due to a sudden drop in plum production.
00:52:46,00:52:46,Right.
00:52:46,00:52:47,Wow.
00:52:47,00:52:48,So there was just some problem.
00:52:48,00:52:49,"There might have been a drought,"
00:52:49,00:52:52,or there might have been some disease or something.
00:52:52,00:52:54,And they just couldn't make enough plums
00:52:54,00:52:55,and so they stopped putting them in burgers.
00:52:55,00:52:59,Does anyone know why they have this laxative effect?
00:52:59,00:53:00,"Because plums, to plums in particular,"
00:53:00,00:53:02,is it just dried fruit in general?
00:53:02,00:53:03,It's just fibrous.
00:53:03,00:53:05,"No, it's partly fibrous."
00:53:05,00:53:06,I did happen to look into this
00:53:06,00:53:09,"because I'm particularly grateful to prunes, personally."
00:53:09,00:53:11,And I don't think it should be a source of shame.
00:53:11,00:53:11,Okay.
00:53:11,00:53:15,"So they are high in fibrous because they're dried fruit,"
00:53:15,00:53:16,which is very useful.
00:53:16,00:53:19,"But they also contain this thing called sorbetal,"
00:53:19,00:53:22,which has a laxative effect.
00:53:22,00:53:24,"And sorbetal, you may recognize the name."
00:53:24,00:53:25,I do.
00:53:25,00:53:26,It's not in chewing gum.
00:53:26,00:53:27,It's in chewing gum.
00:53:27,00:53:29,"It's the sweetener in sugar-free chewing gum,"
00:53:29,00:53:31,"which means that if you look at sugar-free chewing gum,"
00:53:31,00:53:33,there's often a warning on it.
00:53:33,00:53:35,"Apparently, saying if you have to..."
00:53:35,00:53:37,Don't eat two packs of this if you're on the tube.
00:53:37,00:53:41,It's along those lines and there's a picture of Ash.
00:53:41,00:53:45,"You know, I used to eat a lot of chewing gum."
00:53:45,00:53:47,And I stopped because I read the article about them
00:53:47,00:53:49,putting microplastics in your body.
00:53:49,00:53:50,"Oh, yeah, right."
00:53:50,00:53:51,"Ah, isn't that weird?"
00:53:51,00:53:52,Does it?
00:53:52,00:53:52,"Yeah, it does."
00:53:52,00:53:54,"And I don't think it does you any harm,"
00:53:54,00:53:56,but just something about that gave me the echo
00:53:56,00:53:57,and I just stopped using that.
00:53:57,00:53:59,"But you're meant to spit the chewing gum out, right?"
00:53:59,00:54:00,Have you been swallowing it?
00:54:00,00:54:00,"Like, you're swallowing it."
00:54:00,00:54:01,You are allowed.
00:54:01,00:54:02,"Well, you are allowed to swallow chewing gum."
00:54:02,00:54:03,"No, it's not that."
00:54:03,00:54:05,It's the crunchy bit on the outside.
00:54:05,00:54:07,"Okay, the shell kind of exits way in."
00:54:07,00:54:07,That makes sense.
00:54:07,00:54:09,"Oh, do you not cut yours open"
00:54:09,00:54:10,and knife and fork out the meat?
00:54:10,00:54:13,You're not meant to eat the shell.
00:54:13,00:54:15,"That's like, it's like a lobster."
00:54:15,00:54:17,You get your special chewing gum fork.
00:54:17,00:54:21,"Yeah, you were a bit, don't you, Andy,"
00:54:21,00:54:22,when you're eating chewing gum?
00:54:22,00:54:31,"Okay, that is it."
