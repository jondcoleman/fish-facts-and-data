00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Hi everybody, Anna and Andy here. We have a little bit of exciting news for you before

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,360
 this week's show starts.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:12,880
 Yes, we do. We are actually doing two live shows in the very near future. Very excited

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,720
 about both of them. So one of them is on the 7th of June and that's in Belgium.

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,280
 Yeah, it's lovely Belgium and it'll be even lovelier if you're at the Nerdland festival.

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,440
 This is run by long time friend of the podcast, Leven Skida. It's such a good festival. There's

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:34,000
 all sorts of amazing sciencey, nerdy, comedy, brilliant stuff there, including a show from

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,840
 us. We're going to be doing a show there on the 7th of June which is a Saturday and the

9
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,920
 whole festival is amazing. It's just an amazing weekend of wonderful things going on. It's

10
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,760
 so much fun. We highly recommend it if you haven't been already.

11
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:52,020
 We really do. So book yourself a trip there now and then book yourself a trip to Sheffield

12
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,840
 for the Crossed Wires Festival that's on the 6th of July and again we'll be performing

13
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:03,400
 there on the Sunday and to get tickets for either of these events you can go to knowsuchthingsofish.com.

14
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:10,240
 That's right. So do that now. Just do that now. Yeah. Do it. Do it now. knowsuchthingsofish.com

15
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,160
 and as I already said it, you know the address. It's the same as the show name. It's always

16
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,480
 the same. For God's sake, why do we keep saying it? Yeah. Alright, see you at those shows.

17
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,280
 On with the podcast. On with the show.

18
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:42,320
 Hello and welcome to another episode of knowsuchthingsofish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the

19
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,600
 QI offices in Hoburn. My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, James

20
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,880
 Harkin and Andrew Hunter Murray. And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

21
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,560
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days. And in no particular order, here

22
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,520
 we go. Starting with fact number one, that is Andy. My fact is that Venice's most famous

23
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:09,840
 bridge was built by a man named Antonio the Bridge. What's it? What's it? Yes. What's

24
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,240
 it? What's it? Is it Rialto? It's the Rialto Bridge, which is the biggie. Yeah. It's not

25
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:22,120
 the biggest, but it is the famous one, most venerable. And the builder was Antonio D'Aponte,

26
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,440
 which certain members of this podcast have pointed out might mean Antonio Orville from

27
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:31,160
 the bridge. It just doesn't mean Antonio the Bridge. Lame. Lame. Can't a fellow have a little

28
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,560
 flair on this podcast. We don't want to alienate the Italian listeners. Well, this was sent

29
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:41,080
 in by Marco Batuzzo as originally wanted. So I think he will be pretty alienated by you

30
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:49,720
 now. So thanks to Marco for sending us in. This is about Venice. La Serenissima, you know.

31
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:55,120
 City of canals. That doesn't sound very sexy, does it? Queen of the Adriatic. That sounds

32
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:02,080
 sexy. Yeah. The floating city. Yes. Scondolas. It smells quite like shit. Does it? For a

33
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,760
 lot of the year. Really? Yeah. Have you guys been to Venice? Yeah. Lots of pigeons, I seem

34
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,880
 to remember. There was in St. Mark's Square, is it? Pigeon St. Mark's Square. But yeah,

35
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:16,200
 for a lot of the year, the effluence sort of backs up and it does smell pretty whiffy.

36
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,200
 You and I should take charge of their tourist industry. You could really stole a lot of

37
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,700
 their properties. They're trying to put people off, aren't they? Yeah. Anyway, Antonio D'Aponte

38
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,480
 designed the Rialto and this actually gets to another fact. I've been trying to smuggle

39
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,360
 into this podcast for some months now, which is the Canaletto, the man most famous for

40
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:37,360
 painting all the canals in Venice, was born Giovanni Canal, John Canal was his name and

41
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,200
 then he painted canals for a living. And these guys didn't think that was a good fact. I

42
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,160
 think it's a good fact. I just thought he was more well known than Antonio off the

43
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,080
 bridge. Yeah, true. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's weird that we don't seem to know much

44
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:55,240
 about Mr. Bridge. We know his nephew had nepotism on his side because he built a bridge himself.

45
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:01,080
 This was the bridge of size. Oh, that's the second most famous one in Venice. We'll get

46
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,680
 back to your bridge, Andy, but that bridge was called that because it was the last site

47
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,920
 that prisoners would see before they would then put into a building. So the idea was

48
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:16,920
 the sigh would be, oh, this is it. Supposedly... What a shit bridge to end on. Supposedly Byron

49
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:21,000
 gave it the name, the bridge of size. Really? We don't know his nepotism. He might have

50
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,120
 just been a naturally good bridge builder like his uncle. Absolutely true. Can you tell

51
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,280
 us any more about Antonio or not? I've only got one thing about Antonio D'Aponte. So

52
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:33,880
 it was 1591. He's designing it. And there is a legend that he made a deal with the devil.

53
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,960
 Oh, is that true? It's one of those, is it? It's one of those. Wow. And the bridge would be a success,

54
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,640
 but in exchange, the devil would claim the soul of the first person who crossed the bridge.

55
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,480
 Actually, I would say that's quite a good deal for him because usually it's the person who designs

56
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:50,200
 it who has to give their soul away. Exactly, exactly that. And he tried to trick the devil

57
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,360
 by making a rooster walk over the bridge first. That never works. The devil sees through that

58
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,360
 kind of shit. The devil saw through it and then ensured that the first human to cross was D'Aponte's

59
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:04,760
 own wife. Uh-oh. Oh, he then died. He read it after the rooster. Do we know anything about her?

60
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:11,800
 No. Did she die? Did she die? She's not still alive. I mean, I don't think the story is...

61
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,080
 I don't think we need to... Not true. I don't think we need to dig into that story.

62
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,800
 There's quite a few legends about it, isn't there? So this was the fourth bridge that was

63
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,040
 built in this spot. It's not the fourth bridge. Is that an actual bridge? That's in Scotland.

64
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,760
 That's in Scotland, of course. So there were previous bridges and it was going to cost a lot,

65
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:34,120
 a lot of money. And there's a story that goes that a couple who were talking to the government

66
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,600
 who were financing it, they said, "This is an impossible feat. It's going to collapse. It's

67
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:45,960
 not going to work. If it happens, I, to God, let a nail grow out between my thighs," said the man.

68
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:52,440
 And the lady said, "Yes, and let a fire burn my vagina." And she said, "A fire should burn my

69
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,520
 nature." But that's what she was talking about. Now, if you look on the bridge, there are two

70
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,840
 facades where there is a lady with a fire in between her legs and there's a man with a sort

71
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,000
 of third leg that's coming out. And supposedly it's in connection to that legend. I think it is,

72
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,920
 isn't it? Yeah. Even though that probably didn't happen. But you know, it was a, like, screw you,

73
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:13,000
 middle finger to the people who said it would never happen. Because it took almost 100 years

74
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,760
 to be built from when it was promised. So the whole of Venice, it was a joke that no one was

75
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,920
 ever going to build it. So they did do that sculpture as a middle finger. But I feel like

76
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,600
 the man got off lightly because, A, he said, "Let a nail grow between my thighs." And it's not a

77
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,520
 nail, it's a leg. It's a leg. He got a third leg. So you just got a third leg. That's almost an asset.

78
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:33,400
 Well, I'm not sure. You wouldn't say no to a third leg, would you? I think I would, actually,

79
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:38,440
 because I think it's associated with certain entertainers from the 1970s that I wouldn't

80
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:45,720
 want to be associated with. Okay. Well, there's no good on that bridge. So can I ask the previous

81
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:51,080
 bridges? So this is the fourth one, the realtor, right? Yeah. Were they all wooden and burned down

82
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:57,880
 or something or what? A wolf came and huffed and huffed. They were kind of omitted. They were

83
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:04,680
 often replaced for reasons like we need to get ships along this bit of the lagoon or the lake

84
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,200
 or the canal or whatever. And actually, it's too tall. So one of the previous ones was the draw

85
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,440
 bridge. Oh, really? Great fun. But I think they wanted something a bit more permanent. So previous

86
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:17,160
 times that this bridge went down, one was it was burnt down as part of a revolt. And then the next

87
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:23,080
 time, the rebuilt one, which was in 1444, collapsed because a crowd of people were running to the

88
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:29,560
 marriage of the Marquis of Ferrara. And the weight couldn't take it. And so it just collapsed. Wow.

89
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:36,840
 Obviously the Marquis of it sounded like you were just clearing your throat at the double ARA.

90
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:41,720
 Ah, what famous thing about the bridges in Venice is they used to fight over them a lot,

91
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,520
 didn't they? And when I say fight over them, I mean, they were walking over them. It's mine! It's mine!

92
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:51,640
 It's mine! It was like families and they used to just have big old scraps over the bridges.

93
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:58,040
 Yeah, sounds like such a fun era. Yeah. It was a particular day. You'd go to a bridge on a day

94
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,400
 and there would be the day of fighting. You know what? I think it happened quite regularly.

95
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:06,440
 But yeah, like it would be an Easter thing or a special day of the year. It was just fistfights.

96
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,200
 Just fistfights. And they weren't really fighting over anything in particular. It wasn't like we

97
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:15,560
 want this bridge like Anna says. It was just like we want honour. So it'll make everyone in our family

98
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:21,560
 like us if we win this fight. Yeah, I think it was originally started with the two massive factions,

99
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,160
 which kind of split Venice, the Castellani, who were the shipbuilders and the sailors and the

100
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,560
 Niccolotti who were the fishermen. And you know, they just hated each other. So they came and

101
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:34,280
 they had some stick fights for a while. And then I think they decided to convert to fists.

102
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:40,120
 And it only ended in 1705. So it started in 14th century, happened all the time. Always a bridge

103
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:46,920
 you can find somewhere with a fight on it. And in 1705, when one fight got so big and so popular

104
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:52,600
 that the San Girolamo church somewhere else in the city caught fire and was going to burn down.

105
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,960
 And they relied on firemen volunteers to come and fix it. But all the firemen volunteers were

106
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:02,600
 watching this fight and refused. And so this amazing church burned down because these lazy

107
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,760
 firemen were too busy at the fight. You do wonder what happened in the past with it being fights

108
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:11,000
 between the shipbuilders and the fishermen. Because they must get together quite often for

109
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,640
 business, right? Oh, yeah, you're right. You want someone to build you a ship. Exactly. The fishermen

110
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:21,000
 depend on the shipbuilders. And the shipbuilders depend on the fishermen to buy their boats.

111
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,040
 Why are they alienating each other? It's not good business.

112
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:28,680
 That's just rivalry, isn't it? It's like us and the Big Bang Theory, you know? Like,

113
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,360
 we're all part of this great comedy world, but we're daggers drawn.

114
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,800
 Oh, yeah, they really care about us.

115
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,720
 With hindsight, I should have set off menu.

116
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,680
 Yeah, we say people who we've actually met and are still going.

117
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:51,160
 Dad, we won. We defeated the Big Bang Theory. So obvious. I was looking up other notable people

118
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:56,360
 from Venice. And specifically people whose names sounded like the thing that they did. Found an

119
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:04,760
 archaeologist called Iocomo Boni. Brilliant. Unfortunately, he was an archaeologist of

120
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,920
 Roman architecture, as opposed to finding bones. But he must have come across some bones when

121
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,280
 he was doing that stuff. He would have cleared some bones out the way, yeah. And that's the only one

122
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:16,680
 I found. That was really good. How long did that couple of days work?

123
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:22,120
 I actually lost a lot of time because Leonardo da Vinci is of Vinci. And I thought, okay,

124
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:27,160
 where is Antonio the bridge from? So I looked up bridge and there's a few places around the world

125
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:32,440
 called bridge, but none in Italy. And I thought, oh my God, so where is he from? Now, after about

126
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,680
 half an hour, I realized... You searched the word bridge, not ponte.

127
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,800
 So I've got a lot of facts about little villages called bridge around the UK.

128
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,040
 You didn't give us some of them, that's great. Well, there's one in Canterbury, near Canterbury,

129
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:53,000
 called bridge, population 1500. Its only cultural milestone for it is that it was once featured

130
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,880
 in a show called Robby the Car, in which bridges traffic congested roads were shown. That's the

131
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:02,760
 only popular cultural reference that it has ever had. And do we mean Robby the Car or Robby of the

132
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:09,480
 Car? Robby the Car. And don't fall for it. But ponte, there are lots of pantes, it turns out,

133
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:16,840
 when I re-googled it in Italy, but we also have a ponte in the UK. Ponte Pritt. We've got ponte

134
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:21,880
 Fract. Ponte Fract, which literally means broken bridge. Broken bridge. Yes, why does it mean that?

135
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:27,400
 I'm not talking about that. I stopped researching it, but it was... You'd gone off course at this point.

136
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:31,960
 Someone quite famous, there was a bridge that was broken and they rebuilt it. And so we got its

137
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:36,200
 name off the back of it a very long time ago. Nice. There we go. There's the detail you needed.

138
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:41,560
 I didn't know this, maybe it's very well known if you've been to Venice, but it's obviously in the

139
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:46,680
 middle of this lagoon. Do you know the average depth of the lagoon? It's going to be either 90

140
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,680
 centimetres or it's going to be too wild. I think it's really shallow. It's one meter,

141
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:55,160
 half fridge depth, one meter. Wow. And it varies quite a lot, but you have to, if you are in a

142
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,240
 boat, you really need to know the right route, otherwise you are going to get beach, but basically

143
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,320
 you could puddle across the time. Do people swim across? No, they don't. They really don't. And

144
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,840
 people say, you know, even foreigners are not recommended to boat across because you won't

145
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:11,640
 be able to navigate it. Because unlike the channel swim that people do, if you get tired,

146
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,400
 you drown, but in this one you could literally stand and just fake that you're still with the front

147
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:20,280
 floor. It's still going. That's how I swam till I was about 11 years old. When you were there,

148
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:25,080
 you've been there. I've been there a few times. Yeah, when I was very young. Did you go in the

149
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:31,880
 gondolas? Yeah. And did you have a maestro on board singing? Oh no. Because they don't sing,

150
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:36,440
 I believe, the gondolas. I always didn't. No. I think you have to. Actually, I was quite taciturn

151
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,680
 thinking about it. Right. Well, I think they are because they're really busy punting you along.

152
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:45,320
 It's really high effort. Like you'd have to be tailors. I was going to sing. Sing, damn it.

153
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,880
 They get a bit snippy when you ask them to sing. And I read an interview with a gondola who said,

154
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:58,360
 yes, we know if anyone sings just one connetto that they're British. But there are only about 430

155
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:04,040
 proper gondoliers in the city. The gondolas are a very specific kind of boat. And there are also

156
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:09,480
 the trageti, which are like bus gondolas, which go, there are more like ferries across waterways.

157
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,160
 I just remembered, I have been in a gondola where they were singing. Oh, really? Yeah. And they were

158
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:18,200
 singing, oh, so let me or not. Just one connetto. Just one connetto. Yeah. But the effect is the same.

159
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:24,840
 And that was in Las Vegas. Because there is like the, is it called the Venetian? Maybe it is.

160
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:29,800
 One of the hotels, they have like gondoliers on the outside. Yeah, yeah. They all lean a little

161
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,680
 bit to the right, don't they? The gondolas? The gondolas, yes. Politically, you mean? Yes,

162
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:40,840
 they're all very, very Republican. That's that. No, I don't know their political leanings,

163
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:45,240
 but their physical leanings to the right, every gondola is exactly 24 centimeters longer on its

164
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:50,200
 left hand side, so that the keel bends round to the right and it tilts a bit to the right.

165
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,360
 Why? It's because it's kind of like, if you imagine you're punting, but the gondoliers punt

166
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,800
 on one side, they row from the right side. And so if they were on the right side and it was straight,

167
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:04,680
 then it would keep veering to the left. Yeah, that's clever. That's clever. It's all wonky.

168
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:09,160
 We haven't even talked about the doge. Oh, that's the guy who ran it. Is it a charge?

169
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:14,520
 Yeah, or she, but mostly guys. Was there ever a female doge? I believe not. But the doge is

170
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:19,720
 they lasted for the Republic lasted a thousand years until Napoleon came along and just ended

171
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,760
 it like that. Yeah, we're sad. Do you know who was instrumental in the restoration of the doge

172
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:32,680
 palace? Iocomo Boni. Archaeologist, yeah. He was very much involved in that.

173
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:43,560
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact. My fact this week is that,

174
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:48,840
 for the last seven years, a science lab in Italy has continuously been looking for

175
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:55,800
 something that supposedly happens less than once every trillion trillion years. It's very cool.

176
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:02,280
 Is it you making the tea? What? I just, I thought one of us had to have come out

177
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,480
 with a joke in advance for that and none of us had. And I can see it hadn't happened.

178
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,160
 So that was a prepped joke as well. No, that was on the fly. I suddenly realized

179
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,520
 we should have prepped something. Got it. Guys, why didn't you prep anything?

180
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:18,280
 Yeah, what is this, Dan? This is the cryogenic underground observatory for rare events,

181
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:25,240
 also known as Cura, which is heart in the Italian language. Cool. It's a particle physics experiment.

182
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:30,760
 It's underground and it is trying to basically work out why it is that the universe is in the

183
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:35,400
 way it is. We are missing a lot of mass in the universe. Dark matter is not there. Scientists,

184
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,640
 it's one of the biggest problems. How can we not find it? I know this study. It's done by a guy

185
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:47,000
 called Giovanni Neutrino. I have a question, Dan. Yeah, yeah. If this only happens once every

186
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,160
 trillion trillion years, and they've been going for seven years, are they just hoping to get

187
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:55,480
 incredibly lucky? It's got to happen sometime, right? Even though we're living in a 14 billion

188
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,240
 year old universe. So what's the deal there? Are they trying to make it happen?

189
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:06,040
 What is the actual thing that they're looking for? What they're looking for is they're trying to work

190
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:11,800
 out whether or not neutrinos, which they're incredibly, incredibly tiny. There's a comparative

191
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:16,200
 which says that if an atom is the size of the solar system, the neutrino at the center is the

192
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,560
 size of a golf ball. So this is an extraordinarily... Oh, no, I'm interested.

193
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:27,080
 When radiation happens, isn't it right that neutrinos are created? When radioactive molecules

194
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:33,400
 decay? Yes. So I think basically what they're really excited about finding here is a decay that

195
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:38,440
 doesn't spit out neutrinos, right? Neutrino-less decay. So the idea is that when atoms decay,

196
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,200
 they spit out two electrons. Sometimes they spit out two electrons, two neutrinos,

197
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,840
 and scientists have gone for ages. We reckon that sometimes atoms decay, and the two neutrinos that

198
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:51,960
 would be spat out will actually erase each other, because one will be a neutrino, one will become

199
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,960
 an anti-neutrino, and nothing will be spat out. And this will answer all our questions about why

200
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,920
 there's so little antimatter in the universe. But I don't know if they found it yet.

201
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,280
 I think we would have heard if they had. No, they haven't found it yet.

202
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,600
 And the way that they can do it in seven years, or not do it yet in seven years,

203
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:14,040
 but they're hoping to do it sometime, is just they have a lot of stuff, right? So it would

204
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,520
 happen to an individual molecule once every trillion, trillion years. But if you've got a

205
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,200
 trillion, trillion molecules, then it'll happen every year. I understand. I mean...

206
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,720
 Oh, so it only happens less than once every trillion, trillion years to each molecule,

207
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:30,600
 kind of thing, right not ever in the universe. And so they're observing it in this incredible

208
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:35,480
 refrigerator that they've built. It's called the cryostat. And it basically...

209
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,080
 Would they keep milk in this refrigerator? You probably would know where milk is kept.

210
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:48,600
 Basically, the idea... Let's get back to the physics guys. So the refrigerator takes the

211
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:54,920
 temperature down to what is called 10 millikelvin, which is just barely above absolute zero.

212
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:59,960
 And the conditions are basically colder than the coldest spot of space. It went out to the

213
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,600
 coldest bit of the void of the space. This is colder. So it's a pretty amazing thing going on.

214
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,000
 It's amazing we can create the coldest spot in the universe.

215
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,040
 Yeah, it really is. And the other amazing thing about is about where this thing is,

216
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:16,680
 because if you're trying to study neutrinos, you want to avoid cosmic bombardment.

217
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,760
 Oh yeah. Because there's neutrinos going around all the time, right?

218
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,680
 Constantly. They're everywhere. So if you're looking for them, that's going to be tough,

219
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:29,160
 because they're everywhere. They're in you, they're in your cup of tea that Dan didn't make.

220
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,960
 They're everywhere. So you need to create an environment where they aren't.

221
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,200
 Exactly. And so what they do, they go beneath a mountain range, which helps.

222
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,360
 But another layer of protection they've got is, and this is something we've mentioned a few years

223
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:50,040
 ago, ancient Roman ingots of lead, which were found in a 2000 year old shipwreck. And they

224
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:54,680
 gained the permission to use these for science rather than putting them in a museum, I guess

225
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,680
 because they're 2000 year old lumps of lead, who cares. But they've been at the bottom of the

226
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,760
 ocean all this time, so they haven't absorbed any cosmic bombardment. So they're relatively clean.

227
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:10,120
 And that has been, they've been melted down and formed into a shield to protect these towers of

228
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:15,000
 fridge units, basically. Yeah. Crystals, which are making the place so cold. So it's surrounded by

229
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,200
 2000 year old Roman lead shield. It's a pile, isn't it? It's just under a mountain in Italy,

230
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:25,240
 like it's mad. It's James Bond stuff. It is. And it's the coldest cubic meter in the universe.

231
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,880
 Like that's just, that is the final cherry on the top. It's just nuts. And the Romans helped

232
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,920
 to build it as if they didn't take credit for everything else. I mean, neutrinos have been

233
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:40,440
 causing problems for scientists for a while, haven't they? Since we imagine they might exist,

234
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,240
 people tried to look for them for ages. And because they're so tiny and charge-less,

235
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,240
 and they don't interact with anything at all, they're almost totally undetectable. So I think

236
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:54,600
 Wolfgang Pauli in 1930, when he said, I think neutrinos must exist, immediately said,

237
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:59,720
 I've done a terrible thing. I have postulated a particle that cannot be detected. I felt really

238
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:05,960
 bad about it. But they did find it 26 years later. And this was two scientists called Rains and Cowan

239
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,880
 in 1956. Do you know what their original plan was for how to find a neutrino?

240
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:17,240
 Here, neutrino. Here, here, neutrino. It's a whistle. Yeah. What was happening in the 1950s?

241
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:21,000
 So there were some big experiments going on in America. Yeah, nuclear bombs. Yeah.

242
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:26,360
 They were like, let's set off a nuclear bomb since it's happening anyway. And they went to the US

243
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,360
 government and they said, do you mind if we set off a nuclear bomb about the same size as the one

244
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:36,200
 in Hiroshima? And then we'll plant a neutrino detector near it and it'll detect stuff. And

245
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,920
 that was what they were going to do. And it was only at the last minute they thought actually a

246
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:45,240
 nuclear reactor would be easier. They used that. Yeah, Pauli, by the way, was in Friend of the

247
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:54,120
 Podcast, the smartest ever photograph. He was one of those guys and he won a Nobel Prize a bit

248
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:59,800
 later for bombarding uranium with neutrons and creating two new elements called Ocenium and

249
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:06,920
 Hesperium. I mean, do you guys know those elements? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Well, they don't exist. It turns

250
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,600
 out that he'd made a huge mistake. And even though he won Nobel Prize for it, those two elements

251
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,920
 don't exist. Do they then take the Nobel Prize back? No, they didn't. Because all the work was

252
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:19,080
 very important, what he was doing, what he'd actually done. And the only found out this way

253
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:25,400
 later is that he'd actually split the atom. And what he'd made was not Ocenium and Hesperium,

254
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,080
 but it was a mixture of barium, krypton, and a load of other elements that he got from splitting

255
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:34,920
 the atom. Really? Yeah. It turned out he'd done something even more important. I love these stories.

256
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:40,440
 Turns out the atom was split by mistake. Someone was walking across the lab with a tray and they

257
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:48,360
 tried to cut some carrots in the kitchen. You know, so neutrinos are everywhere, as we've said.

258
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:53,800
 And they don't get, they don't change course. So they're good at being traced back. You can cut,

259
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,240
 if you can trace the direction of a neutrino, which is obviously very hard to do, you can just say,

260
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:02,600
 "Oh, look, it comes from that supernova over there." Because they're not affected by like gravity or

261
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,200
 anything like that. Like anything at all? They pass because they're so tiny. They pass through,

262
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,880
 if they, like if they put a hundred million, no, sorry, hang on one second. Oh, I can tell you

263
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:14,920
 how many. Okay, great. If you listen to the song "Bound for the Reload" by Oxide and Neutrino,

264
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:20,600
 the garage act. Brilliant song. I love it. Number one, with a casualty theme tune in the background.

265
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:27,400
 Exactly. Yeah. In the time it takes you to listen to that song, 2.27 quadrillion neutrinos will have

266
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,640
 passed through your body. Have you listened to that song? I've listened to half of it. Oh,

267
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,240
 so how many neutrinos passed through your body before you gave up? Only about a quadrillion,

268
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:41,720
 then I thought, you know what? It's not for me. But what's weird apparently is they're so tiny that

269
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,080
 as they're passing through you, they don't make contact with the neutrinos that they're in the

270
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:49,960
 atoms of your body. It only happens like once or twice in your lifetime. But if you threw a golf

271
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:54,680
 ball through the solar system, it wouldn't hit another. So is that astonishing? A neutrino could

272
00:22:54,680 --> 00:23:02,600
 go through lead for a light year of distance and not hit a single atom on the way. Solid lead,

273
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:08,360
 crazy. It's just mad. It's just mad things. And there's an argument to say. What's the point

274
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,880
 in studying them? Because they don't interact with anything. They don't bother anyone. But

275
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:18,680
 they were really, really essential in one specific period. And that was the lepton epoch. So they're

276
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:23,880
 a type of lepton, just type of particle. Do you guys know how long the lepton epoch lasted? Again,

277
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:29,160
 it's either going to be an 18th of a millisecond or it's going to be five. I have a feeling it might

278
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,920
 have been less than an 18th of a millisecond. Was it at the very start of the universe? It was

279
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:37,400
 the start of the universe. It wasn't quite less than that. It lasted between one to 10 seconds

280
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,400
 after the Big Bang. That was their moment of glory. That's longer than you managed to get through

281
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:48,120
 that UK garage sun. Yeah, that was when they were important. It was just them hanging out,

282
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:53,160
 establishing the structure of the universe. It is crazy. So these guys are looking for

283
00:23:53,160 --> 00:24:00,760
 neutrino-less double-beta decay, as very well explained earlier on. But do you know who discovered

284
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:07,320
 double-beta decay? Oh, gee. Oh. As in with all the neutrinos involved. Is it a friend of the podcast?

285
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:15,000
 No, it's not. It's someone called Maria Gerpert-Meyer. Maria Gerpert-Meyer was, she basically took 30

286
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,600
 years to become a professor because she was at school and then her school closed down because

287
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,920
 she was at school for girls and they just closed it. She was in Germany just before she was due

288
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:32,040
 to graduate. When was this? This was in the middle of the 20th century. She was born in 190 something.

289
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:38,120
 And she basically, yeah, it took her ages and ages to get a professorship because basically

290
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,520
 women couldn't really do it back then. And then three years after she got a professorship, she won

291
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:48,680
 a Nobel Prize. And of all the people who were linked with the Manhattan Project, there were 30 men

292
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:53,240
 who got Nobel Prizes and she was the only woman to get a Nobel Prize for the Manhattan Project.

293
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:59,640
 And she kind of came up with loads of ideas. One of them was something called spin orbit coupling.

294
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:06,920
 And it's the way that particles go around orbit in atoms and stuff. And the way that she did it is

295
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:11,480
 she knew Enrico Fermi. She was like one of these people who, when she had an idea, she would just

296
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:16,520
 talk and talk and talk and talk. And it was almost like an avalanche coming over you and telling you

297
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,680
 what was happening. And then Enrico's like, look, it's too much. I don't understand. It's too complicated.

298
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:26,120
 It's too many words. Just go away and think about it. And she came back and basically then started

299
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:30,760
 dancing the waltz with him. And then her whole theory from then on was that these little things

300
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:35,800
 move around the atom exactly the way that couples move when they're waltzing. And it means that

301
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,480
 the ones on the outside move a bit slower. The ones on the inside move a bit faster and they all kind

302
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,720
 of interact with each other in that way. Do you think it was that? Or did you just spend

303
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,480
 ages and ages studying it and then think, I've got to come up with some sort of romantic

304
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:52,040
 revelatory moment for Fermi. Maybe. Get on the dance floor. For the inevitable biopic.

305
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:57,000
 Yes. It kind of more felt like Fermi didn't really understand it. It was like, this is like the

306
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,400
 most advanced physics at the time and still is pretty advanced now. So it was her actually

307
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:06,440
 dumbing it down for him. I think so, yeah. Come on, Fermi. It's good that people were doing the waltz

308
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:11,000
 at the time. As in, you know, modern dancers don't really rely on that kind of. If you were bouncing

309
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,200
 to oxide a new tree, no. Just chaos. Yeah. We've never know. We've never discovered.

310
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,720
 Actually, on particle spin, this is something I don't think we've mentioned before, but it is

311
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:25,880
 amazing if people don't know it. The whole universe is left-handed. We're all on a massive gondola.

312
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:34,760
 So what does that mean? Which basically means that there are certain interactions,

313
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:40,680
 weak interactions involving this weak force, which is what radioactive decay involves,

314
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:46,680
 where all the neutrinos involved spin clockwise, which means they're left-handed and it's in lots

315
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:52,280
 of stuff. So all proteins that create life, the amino acids are lefty. So the amino acids

316
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:57,960
 that spin clockwise. Is there an advantage to it? Like with Teth Place? Oh, you think we're like the

317
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:04,920
 Nadal universe. Exactly. We don't know. About two-thirds of galaxies spin clockwise. We don't

318
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:13,240
 really know why. It's very, very weird. That principle of weak interactions is actually what

319
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:26,520
 the Big Bang Theory sitcom was based on. Suck it, Big Bang.

320
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:33,560
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Anna. My fact is that Siegfried Sassoon's great

321
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:40,680
 grandfather once owned half the opium in India and China. It's a lot of opium. It's so much opium.

322
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:45,640
 It was like a lot of stuff. All personal use? Yeah, definitely intent to supply,

323
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:50,280
 isn't it, when he's pulled over? He didn't bring it all over in his bum, though, did he?

324
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:56,600
 It wasn't stuffed up his anus, no. No, they were classier than that. I don't think it was that

325
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:01,400
 classy the opium was. Oh, look, don't twist my words, James, to make it sound like one of our

326
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:07,080
 lowest colonial moments. I think it was at low points of the British Empire, personally speaking.

327
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:11,480
 So what was it? Britain was owning and trading opium, like growing it in India and then selling

328
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:16,120
 it to China and basically getting China hooked on opium. Yes, exactly. Because it's for trade,

329
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:19,480
 for money. And then China said, please don't do that. And Britain said, all right, well, we're

330
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:23,960
 going to go to war then. Right. Because we're going to make this up. And they had a big old war.

331
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,280
 Then Britain said, well, we're going to keep Hong Kong. And so then we kept Hong Kong. And then

332
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:35,720
 Dan was born. That's the story. If you read my bio online, that's my origin story. Wow.

333
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:39,400
 Do you feel guilty? Do you feel partially responsible for the subjugation of China?

334
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:44,840
 Absolutely. It's why I don't make tea for anyone. I don't want to get any British tradition.

335
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:51,080
 That was a very good joke for anyone unfamiliar with the opium wars, because the whole point was

336
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:55,160
 China was exporting so much tea to us. And we needed to export something back to sort the

337
00:28:55,160 --> 00:29:00,280
 trade deficit. And we found opium. Anyway, this assumes, were they responsible, weren't they?

338
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:09,240
 Well, complicit. Yes. So they were a massive Jewish Iraqi family originally in the 18th century,

339
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:15,400
 and much earlier. And there was this guy, Sheikh Sassoon Ben Salah, who was basically the treasurer

340
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,680
 to all the highest ranking politicians in Baghdad. He was like the treasurer of Baghdad.

341
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:25,320
 And then Jews started being persecuted very badly in Iraq in the early 1800s. And so the family

342
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:31,320
 fled. And this guy called David Sassoon, his son, fled to Bombay with, I think he had something like

343
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:36,360
 18 children, something like that. 14, 14 children, still quite a lot. So they got to Bombay, they

344
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:40,600
 were very successful. They traded lots of things. They allied with the British empire who were doing

345
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:46,040
 quite well in India back then, obviously. And it was around this time when the opium wars were

346
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:50,280
 happening. And Britain was realising how valuable opium was and how much money they could make

347
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:55,080
 trading with China. And the Sassoon's caught on to that. And they got so big, they literally owned

348
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:59,480
 half of the opium, which I actually don't know who owned the other half, but yeah.

349
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:04,200
 Some other company, I guess. So that means Siegfried basically is a nepo baby, right?

350
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:09,160
 Oh, 100%. Yeah. Yeah. Should we say who Siegfried Sassoon is?

351
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:14,520
 Oh, we should. Yeah. Because not everyone will have had the same British education.

352
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:20,760
 So Siegfried Sassoon, one of Britain's great war poets. First World War, he was in the First

353
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:27,640
 World War and he lived from 1886 to 1967. So he survived the war spoiler, but he wrote some

354
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,640
 cracking poems along the way. And yeah, he's a pretty famous name in the UK.

355
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,520
 He's huge. Definitely. We all have to study him at school. Yeah, exactly.

356
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,800
 And all the other war poets like Wilfred Owen and... Exactly. Yeah, yeah.

357
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:42,120
 If you think of a famous war poem and you wonder who it's by, it's always by Wilfred Owen.

358
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:46,840
 It is. Because Andy and I were talking before this about which Siegfried Sassoon poems we know.

359
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:51,960
 And everyone I listed, Andy was like, "No, that's Wilfred Owen. He did the biggies."

360
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:57,560
 Well, he was his mentor, wasn't he? They both met in a hospital that was looking after them,

361
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:02,200
 after they suffered some major shock from the war. And Wilfred Owen came up and said,

362
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:07,160
 "I write poetry as well. Would you have a look?" And he saw potential and he was a mentor to him.

363
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:11,400
 And then now he's eclipsed him. And then a bit later, they met Robert Graves,

364
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:16,600
 who was the other really, really big war poet. And we only recently found out where they met.

365
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,960
 We knew it was somewhere in Scotland, but we didn't know where. And the University of

366
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,640
 Aberdeen lecturer called Neil McLennan found out that it was actually at a place called

367
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:31,400
 Baberton Golf Club. Oh, gosh. Oh, gosh. The old James Google search. Insert word, insert golf.

368
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,960
 Siegfried Sassoon loved golf. It turned out, yeah.

369
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:40,760
 One of his poems called David Cleek Goes to Saint St. Angel's Hymn Forevermore,

370
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:47,960
 The Miracle of Yara Stounding Score. Not one of his best. Was this before or after

371
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:51,160
 his war poetry? Do we know? He probably had shell shock at this stage.

372
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:56,600
 Well, he was writing poetry from before the war. You know, he grew up very affluent,

373
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:00,680
 obviously. But he was already a poet. He sent a lot of early poems to Cricket magazine.

374
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:06,360
 Oh, yeah. Just to Cricket as magazine. And in the war, so the first three years of the war,

375
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:11,240
 when he got a commission as a lieutenant, he was extremely brave. He was recommended for

376
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:16,840
 the Victoria Cross at one point. He won, I think, the Military Cross. But he did nearly

377
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:22,200
 suicidal things to rescue wounded men who were left out in no man's land, things like that.

378
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,240
 Apparently, he single-handedly acquired a German trench.

379
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:29,800
 Yeah, crazy. And then he just sat there apparently reading poems. And then he came back.

380
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:35,960
 Well, Mad Jack was his name, right? Yeah, he was labelled that.

381
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,480
 I couldn't see the point in the German trench thing. And I probably should have looked. But

382
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,280
 basically, he acquired this trench, as you say. And he did it with...

383
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:47,160
 Captured. Yeah, drove away like 60 Germans so soon you were quiet.

384
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,920
 Anyway, my question is, when he got there, what was the point? Because then he went back to the

385
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:54,360
 trench. And I think all the Germans just came back into the trench that he scared them out of.

386
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:59,000
 And his commanding officers were very annoyed because a bit of an attack had had to be delayed

387
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,520
 or called off because they said, oh, there's this weird bulge in the line because Sassoon has done

388
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,720
 something extremely brave. And I think that's why he didn't win the Victoria Cross.

389
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:09,400
 Because like you say, he was nominated and it was for this thing that he was nominated,

390
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:13,080
 but he didn't win it. Actually, he did a quite pointless thing and jeopardised another operation.

391
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:19,800
 Incredibly brave. But he became very disillusioned with the war, as lots of soldiers did. And he

392
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,960
 wrote a letter saying that the war was being deliberately prolonged and really blaming the

393
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:29,480
 generals and politicians, the English generals and politicians, and that it was being conducted

394
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,960
 really badly. And I think some people suggested that he should be court-martialed.

395
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,760
 He certainly was meant to be court-martialed. He was meant to be court-martialed. But every time,

396
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:42,680
 yeah, he was so gung-ho that he took a bullet to the neck, but it missed the main artery,

397
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:47,240
 so he survived. He almost had his head blown off. I think his nihilism, when I was reading about it,

398
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:52,120
 I was thinking that he's so pissed off, isn't he? He's just gone, "Sod this. This is all meaningless

399
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:57,400
 now." Because a lot of his poems are like, "This is all meaningless." But he was basically, like we

400
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:05,000
 said, a Nepo baby. Because he got all this money from his aunt, called Rachel Beer, who had married

401
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,080
 well. I mean, it was a very rich family anyway, but she'd married this guy who was in charge of the

402
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:14,840
 Observer, Frederick Beer, and she'd taken over as editor, becoming the first female editor of a

403
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:19,400
 national newspaper when she did that. But she was a Nepo editor? She was a Nepo editor. How deep does

404
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:24,920
 this Nepo thing go? Well, it goes all the way back to David Sassoon, we've established. But yeah,

405
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:29,960
 she, and then she later purchased the Sunday Times, became editor of that as well.

406
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:33,960
 Which is mad. She edited those at the same time. Really? Opposite ends of the spectrum.

407
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:38,440
 Now they are. Like in those days, the Sunday Times was just like a pamphlet, really.

408
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:45,800
 But yeah, and then she and her husband, well, basically her husband started getting these

409
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:51,400
 headaches. I read one quote in the ODMB saying that, "It suddenly made this mild man irritable,

410
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:58,520
 or at times feverishly gay." And he basically went mad. He insisted that he would have the family

411
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:03,960
 crest clipped out of his black poodles back and walk around with it all the time. And it seems

412
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:09,640
 that he probably had syphilis. And then he died, and as soon as he died, Rachel got really distraught,

413
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:14,520
 but also started succumbing from syphilis. And she started writing articles in the Observer

414
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:19,480
 and the Sunday Times about how great cannibalism is and stuff like that. Oh, really? Right. And

415
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:23,640
 then she wrote one article in the Observer, which rambled on, rambled on. And then it just

416
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:28,440
 said, "Continued in the next." And then we never heard from her again. She was committed to a

417
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:34,200
 asylum. And that was her. But she had a shit ton of money, and she left it all to Siegfried.

418
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:39,400
 And Siegfried then could become a gentleman of pleasure, which meant he loved fox hunting.

419
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:45,720
 Yes. But he also loved golf. So pros and cons. Very interesting. His grandfather,

420
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:50,600
 so David Sassoon was his great-grandfather. His grandfather was called Sassoon Sassoon.

421
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:57,000
 No. But to be fair, he had 14 children. You're running out of ideas by then.

422
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 It's so odd. It just feels like you put the word in the wrong box, doesn't it?

423
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,880
 Can I get another form? No.

424
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,880
 Okay. Well, can I put the first name in the surname? No.

425
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:15,240
 Well, I found a thing that was made a few years ago, which is slightly relevant to this. There's

426
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:20,600
 an instrument maker called Steve Burnett, who a few years ago made the Sassoon violin.

427
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,080
 I think you're going to say the Sassoon bassoon. I know.

428
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,520
 A waste.

429
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:28,040
 In the missed opportunity of the century, he made the Sassoon violin.

430
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:35,240
 It's so annoying. And it's because they'd made the Wilfred Owen violin a few years before.

431
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:39,800
 So it's a sort of well-known violin. It's beautifully made, and it's played all over

432
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:44,040
 the world in famous orchestras and all of this kind of stuff. And rather nicely,

433
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:49,000
 the Sassoon violin was made from the same branch of the same tree as the Owen violin.

434
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,360
 So that's kind of cool. They're united by these violins. Lovely. But I agree.

435
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:55,080
 Bassoon. Sassoon bassoon. It's a no-brainer.

436
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,640
 Owen works. You can say you're bowing with an Owen.

437
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,080
 Oh, very good.

438
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:03,960
 Did you guys see that David Sassoon invented a pickle?

439
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,360
 Did he? Which Sassoon is this now? Sorry.

440
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,960
 This is the original Sassoon who fled to Bombay.

441
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,400
 This is Captain Opium.

442
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,480
 Captain Opium, yeah, 1813.

443
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,040
 Just to give a little bit of, you know,

444
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:20,040
 also he founded a lot of hospitals, libraries, museums, orphanages and schools.

445
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:23,160
 When you got that sweet, sweet drug money rolling in,

446
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,480
 you're going to need to do some reputation laundry, aren't you?

447
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:29,160
 Yeah. So he invented a pickle before or after the opium.

448
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:32,120
 Was it like his passion project was to make a pickle, but, you know,

449
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,200
 he had to wait while he made loads of money off opium?

450
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,000
 He had to earn the money. He had to earn the money to make the pickle.

451
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,080
 In meetings, he was like,

452
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,240
 so what I'm really interested in pitching is my pickle.

453
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,320
 And they were like, we're just like loads more opium, please.

454
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:48,360
 What if we got the entirety of China addicted to pickles?

455
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,800
 It's a great idea, David.

456
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:56,440
 We're going to continue with our order for another million kilos of opium.

457
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:01,320
 Okay. What if I say for your million kilos of opium, you get 10 free pickles?

458
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,880
 Yeah, that's fine.

459
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,480
 We're not going to be very hungry after all that opium,

460
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,480
 but we will try to get around to them.

461
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:13,720
 No, this was just a thing he had on the side, and it was in fact a condiment.

462
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:19,560
 And it's amber, which is a huge deal in Iraqi cuisine and in Jewish Israeli cuisine.

463
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,000
 It appears everywhere.

464
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,480
 It's like the one of the national foods of Iraq.

465
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:28,360
 And basically he went to India and he thought, I love these Indian mangoes.

466
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,200
 It was either him or a member of his family.

467
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,760
 And by the way, this is the story of the amber pickle.

468
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,360
 We don't know that this actually happened,

469
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,400
 but the story of the amber pickle is as soon as he invented it.

470
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,320
 Went to India, loved the mangoes, was like,

471
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:42,520
 "Gotta send some of these back to my mates in Iraq, so I'm going to pickle them."

472
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:46,360
 And found a great way of pickling them that people love to this very day.

473
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,440
 And any Iraqi listeners we have, I'm sure,

474
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,520
 will be showering down on an amber right now.

475
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,880
 Yeah, very nice.

476
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:55,720
 Can I very quickly just mention the greatest Sassoon of them all,

477
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,880
 which we've not mentioned, which is Siegfried.

478
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,720
 So most of his life, he was gay.

479
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:02,520
 He had multiple relationships with men.

480
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,160
 And then out of nowhere, he gets married to a lady.

481
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,840
 They have a child, George Sassoon.

482
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:12,600
 So George Sassoon was a guy who also became an author.

483
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,080
 He wrote three books, and he was quite well known

484
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,720
 because two of those books were pushing his belief

485
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:21,320
 that we were once visited by aliens in the ancient world,

486
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:25,800
 and that they had created a machine that invented food

487
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,480
 that allowed for the Israelites to walk across their 40-year journey

488
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,400
 in the Sinai Desert, right?

489
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,120
 Now, it's called "The Manor Machine," his book.

490
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,080
 Yes, exactly.

491
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,920
 So according to George Sassoon,

492
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:42,040
 there's a nuclear reactor that used to power the manor machine,

493
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:45,800
 and that was stored where else the Ark of the Covenant is.

494
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,200
 I'm afraid we had to fade Dan out there

495
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,160
 because he carried on talking for another 20 minutes,

496
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,760
 and you really didn't need to hear that.

497
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,240
 Available in bookshops now, the manor machine.

498
00:39:55,240 --> 00:40:05,000
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

499
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,600
 and that is James.

500
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,480
 Okay, my fact this week is that no living person

501
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,480
 has ever seen Murray's plums.

502
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,160
 Okay.

503
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,120
 Let me carry on.

504
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:16,680
 Okay.

505
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,720
 One man thought he saw them in 1997,

506
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,800
 but they were much hairier than expected,

507
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,640
 so he probably saw something else.

508
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:28,200
 I'm not sure how hairy my plums were in 1997 when I was 10.

509
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:32,200
 That's why it was surprising.

510
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,880
 Plums.

511
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,960
 What about plums is a fruit?

512
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,280
 Yes.

513
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,000
 Andry.

514
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,520
 So we shouldn't have researched Andy's tests for a couple of times.

515
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,760
 I wondered what all those anonymous phone calls were.

516
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:46,600
 Stop answering your wife's phone.

517
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:51,800
 Prunus Mariana, called the Murray's plum,

518
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:55,240
 is a critically endangered shrub native to Texas,

519
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,600
 and the fruits are supposedly red with white dots,

520
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,520
 hairless, and with a waxy coating,

521
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,840
 but they're so rare that apparently no one's ever seen the fruit.

522
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,800
 No one living, I guess.

523
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,520
 No one living.

524
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:11,320
 So I've read some reports saying that maybe when they were first scientifically described,

525
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,440
 they were mentioned,

526
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,680
 but I've looked for the first scientific description,

527
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,560
 which was by Edward Palmer in 1929,

528
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,840
 and he said,

529
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,280
 "Although I have not seen the fruit,

530
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,880
 this species is so distinct in character of its inforescence

531
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:27,640
 and in the pubescence from any of the plums with which I am acquainted

532
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,880
 that I venture to describe it as new."

533
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,360
 So even the guy who found it hadn't seen one.

534
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,080
 So maybe it might be that they don't exist,

535
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,320
 but I've seen some places saying that they might exist,

536
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:40,200
 but definitely no one's seen one for a long old time.

537
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,520
 It could be that they reproduce with fruit suckers,

538
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,400
 like underneath the roots, as in the clonal.

539
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:45,880
 Right.

540
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,760
 Could be that.

541
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,120
 And they're in Texas, you say.

542
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:48,920
 They're in Texas.

543
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,120
 Do we have a region of Texas?

544
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,720
 If we've got any listeners in Texas,

545
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,160
 should we ask them to look out?

546
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,920
 Because they must, you know, if we have a mess.

547
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,720
 Is that going to solve it?

548
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,200
 Is that...

549
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,120
 I just think it's how it could be how we get ourselves on the map.

550
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:58,760
 No one's looking.

551
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,160
 Yeah, yeah.

552
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,200
 We've rediscovered a plum.

553
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:00,920
 Yeah, you know what?

554
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,440
 There is, it is a certain place,

555
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,720
 but I'd never wrote down where it was.

556
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,280
 Okay, right.

557
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,920
 And there was a guy called Marshall Enquist a bit later

558
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,520
 who wrote a paper about them,

559
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,480
 and he said that he'd found this type of plum,

560
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,800
 and he thought it was prunus mariana.

561
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:18,120
 But really what he wrote didn't sound to me like that.

562
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:18,120
 Okay.

563
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,680
 Everywhere else, like most articles and textbooks today,

564
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:23,400
 they say mariana is its own species and no one's seen the fruit.

565
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:23,720
 Wow.

566
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:26,200
 It's like the Bigfoot of the fruit world, isn't it?

567
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,360
 It's sort of, it's people have claimed to have seen it,

568
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,720
 but we've got no solid evidence.

569
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,480
 If you're in Texas, how big can Texas be?

570
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,600
 I'd be like, probably small.

571
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,720
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

572
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,240
 And then have a look.

573
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,920
 There is a place called Plum in Texas.

574
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:37,400
 Is there?

575
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,360
 Yeah, but it's a very tiny unincorporated town,

576
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,520
 and as far as I could tell, no plums.

577
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,800
 Is there anywhere called Bridge?

578
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,200
 Yes, actually there is.

579
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:50,680
 I think I started burying a very cold freezer

580
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:54,600
 under a mountain range and bombarding it with atomic energy.

581
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,200
 Well, the plums unfortunately will shrink

582
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,680
 under those circumstances, which makes them even harder to find.

583
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,640
 At absolute zero.

584
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,680
 I think your plums go to the size of a dot.

585
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,280
 It's definitely improving at the very least.

586
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,560
 It's blanks constant.

587
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,360
 Plums are good.

588
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,240
 Yeah, they're good.

589
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:10,440
 It used to mean any kind of dried fruit, actually, plum.

590
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,480
 Is that very odd?

591
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,400
 Yeah, raisins would be plums.

592
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:16,200
 Like plum pudding, which has got raisins and sultanas in,

593
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:19,240
 the plum part of that is referring to the old word for raisins.

594
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:22,120
 I always assumed that plum pudding used to contain plums,

595
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,440
 and then just gradually people stopped making them,

596
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:28,040
 because all Christmas puddings used to be called plum puddings in the UK.

597
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,440
 And there's a food writer called Francesca Greeno,

598
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,440
 who was writing about this,

599
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:36,040
 and she reckons that when Little Jack Horner was first written,

600
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:40,280
 which is in the 16th century, plums still meant raisin then.

601
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,000
 So when he stuck in his thumb and pulled out a plum,

602
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,040
 apparently he pulled out a raisin, according to this writer.

603
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,160
 Harder to get on your thumb.

604
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,320
 Well, you could pull out a raisin,

605
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,840
 but you're more like dragging it out

606
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:53,160
 as opposed to shoving your thumb inside it.

607
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,640
 Well, I actually read that the plum wasn't a plum at all,

608
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:59,320
 it was the deeds to a mansion in a bun.

609
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:04,360
 I know, but I really like this, because there was a Jack Horner.

610
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:08,600
 I'm sorry, but the fact that James just said about a nursery rhyme,

611
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,640
 "Oh, they're all made up of."

612
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:16,200
 James was a boy who was constantly saying, "Citation needed."

613
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:21,960
 Well, the not real Jack Horner story,

614
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,880
 which has been around for over 200 years,

615
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,880
 is that there was a Jack Horner, which there really was,

616
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:30,680
 who was the steward to the abbot of Glastonbury called Richard Whiting.

617
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:35,480
 And basically, Henry VIII at the time was dissolving all the monasteries, famously.

618
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:40,360
 And Richard Whiting didn't want Henry VIII to dissolve his monastery,

619
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:44,200
 and so he sent his steward, Jack Horner,

620
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:49,880
 to Henry VIII with a pie in which he'd hidden the deeds to 12 manor houses.

621
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:53,320
 I think it's a sort of a bribe, and on the way little Jack Horner

622
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:57,640
 put his thumb into this pie and nicked one of those deeds for himself,

623
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:01,880
 which I believe the family did get Mel's manor.

624
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:04,680
 So that, and that's little Jack Horner popped his thumb in,

625
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:07,640
 pulled out a plum of Mel's manor, and the family have it to this day.

626
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,080
 And he said, "What a good boy am I?"

627
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,200
 And he said, "What a good boy am I?"

628
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,680
 Yeah, no further questions.

629
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,200
 There we go with this, the story.

630
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:17,240
 A plum used to mean something desirable, like you've got a plum drop.

631
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:18,200
 Oh, that still means that.

632
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,160
 Yeah, yeah, exactly.

633
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,360
 Sorry, yeah, yeah, but it's sorry.

634
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,040
 What it used to mean was £100,000.

635
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:23,400
 Oh.

636
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,200
 There's a specific value in Victorian times.

637
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,360
 Oh, yeah, because that's a lot of money in Victorian times.

638
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,880
 A mega amount, yeah, yeah.

639
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,480
 Why did it get that name?

640
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,040
 Do we know?

641
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:32,680
 I don't know.

642
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:35,720
 I think it's all connected to the plum thing being something desirable,

643
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:38,920
 but I don't know why it was exactly that value.

644
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:39,960
 Yeah.

645
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,120
 It's nice that we've made, because we're always getting in trouble

646
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:45,320
 for bastardising the English language, the wee modern people,

647
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:48,520
 but we've made the word plum more pure,

648
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:52,200
 because it comes from the Latin prunus for a plum tree.

649
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,200
 They screwed it up by the 1600s.

650
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,280
 It meant raisins and whatever you have.

651
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:56,680
 Yeah.

652
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,200
 And now we've made it plum again.

653
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,160
 So kind of well done us.

654
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,520
 We've reclaimed the word plum.

655
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:01,320
 Well done, everyone.

656
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:01,640
 Yeah.

657
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:02,120
 Yeah.

658
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,640
 Just do a part on the back sometime.

659
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,720
 Pat yourself on the back if you're listening to this at home

660
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:07,320
 and you've used the word plum correctly.

661
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:11,880
 Plums in Japan used to be a very big thing.

662
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:12,520
 Oh, they still are.

663
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,120
 They're like bento boxes and so on.

664
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:17,240
 But in wartime, as part of rations for soldiers,

665
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:20,040
 we're talking 1467 to 1615.

666
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:23,320
 This is what was known as the Senkoku Period, roughly.

667
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,520
 Just roughly those numbers.

668
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:28,120
 And so they got given these kind of bento boxes

669
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,400
 and they would go out into war.

670
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,880
 And it had things like chili pepper,

671
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,560
 but they wouldn't eat the chili peppers.

672
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:35,640
 What they would do is, because it'd get really cold out there,

673
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,240
 they would just chew on the chili peppers

674
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,920
 and then they would wipe it all over their butt

675
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,120
 and all down their legs.

676
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,360
 So they would keep them hot.

677
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,640
 Maybe it makes you move around, but hey,

678
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:46,840
 take it up with the Japanese from roughly 1467

679
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:47,560
 to 1615.

680
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:49,880
 I just thought that like there are other parts of you,

681
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,240
 don't go first for the bum.

682
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:55,720
 No, chili peppers around the bum does not feel like a good.

683
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,000
 It doesn't feel like a good idea.

684
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,320
 I've touched my eyes after cutting chilies and it's awful

685
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,680
 and I can only imagine.

686
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:05,560
 Supposedly they would take these dried plums with them

687
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:08,680
 and supposedly they'd get one each in their ration

688
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:10,200
 and if they were out in the field

689
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,560
 and they were sort of short of breath

690
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,080
 and they were having a pretty hard time,

691
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,680
 they would take it out of their lunchbox

692
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,360
 and they wouldn't eat it.

693
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:17,080
 They wouldn't taste it.

694
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,160
 They would look at it for inspiration

695
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,600
 because it was seen as something

696
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,120
 that would give you hope to go on.

697
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,640
 That's nice.

698
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,440
 It's really interesting.

699
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,360
 There's a lot of stuff about plums in this period

700
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,360
 where it's kind of, is this true?

701
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:29,640
 Like for example, samurai swords,

702
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,320
 supposedly when they were being heated up

703
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,760
 to get the metal to the right heating,

704
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,440
 you would take out a dry plum

705
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:36,760
 and to match the colouring of that

706
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,840
 would show you that you've heated it to the right level.

707
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:40,440
 This is all put out by big plum.

708
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:44,040
 It doesn't feel real, that's true.

709
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,960
 Big plum is very powerful globally.

710
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,040
 So in the First World War,

711
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:50,600
 the Daily Telegraph ran a campaign

712
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:53,240
 to get every single soldier fighting on the front.

713
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,480
 That was three million soldiers on the Western Front,

714
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,160
 a portion of plum pudding.

715
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,800
 Yeah, for Christmas, I guess.

716
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:00,920
 It was definitely for Christmas,

717
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,360
 but I do think Siegfried Sassoon

718
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:03,480
 at some point would have received

719
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,200
 his Daily Telegraph back plum pudding.

720
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,800
 I wonder if that's where Rachel hid the deeds

721
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,560
 to the inheritance that he got.

722
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:12,120
 Yeah, but they were a big,

723
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,560
 just plum pudding was so big.

724
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:17,160
 The plum pudding riots of 1647 happened in Canterbury.

725
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,840
 That was a Christmasy thing,

726
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:21,240
 because the Puritans were in charge at the time,

727
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,720
 Oliver Cromwell and his gang,

728
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:26,920
 and their main thing was keeping shops open on Christmas Day.

729
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:27,720
 They said, you have to...

730
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,000
 What, the Puritans at that?

731
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,680
 Yeah, they were not celebrating it.

732
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:32,600
 It's a special day, it's not religious.

733
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:33,400
 Exactly.

734
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,760
 And the Lord Mayor of Canterbury,

735
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,000
 whose name was William Bridge.

736
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:37,640
 Oh.

737
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:38,920
 Yeah, William de Ponte,

738
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:39,880
 as he would have been known.

739
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:42,120
 We had a Canterbury Bridge fact earlier as well,

740
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:42,680
 and now it didn't leave.

741
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,520
 There's a place near Canterbury called Bridge.

742
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,120
 So maybe William Bridge was from Bridge.

743
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:46,520
 Oh my God.

744
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:47,800
 It's possible.

745
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,560
 That's likely, almost, you might say.

746
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:52,200
 Well, he was walking along the streets,

747
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:55,240
 trying to encourage shopkeepers to stay open and stay serving.

748
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:55,400
 Yeah.

749
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,360
 Because it was a Christmas Day.

750
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:59,720
 They all wanted to close and go and party and all of that.

751
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:03,320
 And he was thrown to the ground and muddied.

752
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:03,880
 Oh, no.

753
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:08,280
 Riots were sometimes a bit gentle back in the day.

754
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:11,160
 You never hear about the lighter riots.

755
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,360
 It's so nice.

756
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:12,840
 You've shared that.

757
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,360
 Does that mean just made money?

758
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:15,640
 It doesn't mean he shat himself.

759
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:15,880
 Does it?

760
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,080
 I don't believe so.

761
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,200
 I'm sure it was a scary time,

762
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,480
 but no one would blame him if he did.

763
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:21,640
 Absolutely not.

764
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:26,520
 In 2001, Big Plum stepped up again

765
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:30,360
 and forced the US Food and Drug Administration

766
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:34,440
 to allow them legally to call prunes dried plums.

767
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,360
 Prunes are dried plums, aren't they?

768
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,600
 They are, yes.

769
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,400
 But until then, you could get a sense of prison for saying that.

770
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,800
 I mean, honestly, as soon as you say that,

771
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,000
 they'd be banging down the door.

772
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,400
 The Plum Police.

773
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,680
 They've got very fetching outfits, though.

774
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:51,320
 They're lovely.

775
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:53,720
 Yes, no, they are.

776
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,720
 So it was the truth, which is why they were allowed to do it.

777
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:57,560
 But also because...

778
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:00,760
 So they were marketed as prunes, obviously,

779
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,440
 but prunes have a bad rep.

780
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:03,640
 Well, I think it's a good rep.

781
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:05,240
 They're a great relief to many of us.

782
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:05,560
 I would like to live.

783
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,080
 They're a bit of a sticky situation, yes.

784
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,040
 But their argument, what Big Plum's argument,

785
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,320
 Big Prune's argument was,

786
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,160
 now everyone just thinks if you're buying prunes,

787
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:14,840
 that it means you're constipated.

788
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:17,080
 So they're reluctant to buy prunes.

789
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,160
 We're going to rename them dried plums.

790
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:22,520
 And did that masterful piece of disguise work?

791
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,680
 Yeah, but the entire country was constipated

792
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,760
 because they couldn't get hold of any prunes.

793
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,240
 I don't need these dried plums.

794
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:32,600
 Do you guys remember that story of Ash,

795
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:33,960
 who is the, for listeners,

796
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:37,320
 he's the rider of our theme tune for fish?

797
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,160
 Which one? Which one of them any?

798
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:41,240
 He was going out to a party in London

799
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,680
 and he was really hungry

800
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,360
 and he was nothing in the house to eat.

801
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,960
 And so he opened up the cupboard

802
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:49,800
 and there was a big bag of dried prunes.

803
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:53,880
 He ate the entire bag, got on the London Underground,

804
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,680
 was midway between stops

805
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,920
 when he felt a little "woop" in his tummy

806
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,520
 and he went, "That's a bit weird."

807
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:01,560
 And then a second later,

808
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,160
 shat himself completely, yeah.

809
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,680
 Just outside Mutshoot, wasn't it?

810
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:08,040
 That's the best.

811
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:10,200
 That's the fastest London Underground diary

812
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,160
 that I've ever heard.

813
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:15,240
 Oh dear, what happened?

814
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:16,600
 Oh, he had to get off.

815
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:19,240
 Did he go to the party still?

816
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:19,800
 I'm not sure.

817
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,480
 No, he went into an alleyway

818
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,480
 that was just outside of the station,

819
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,280
 called his dad.

820
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:25,560
 He said, "Dad, I've shat myself."

821
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:26,920
 How old was he?

822
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:30,040
 He was 22, 23, called his brother Jazz

823
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:31,720
 and Jazz came with a bucket

824
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:34,280
 and a cloth and some extra trousers.

825
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:35,480
 What, a bucket?

826
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:36,760
 Yeah, because he just said it was everywhere.

827
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,200
 Because Ash had to take off his shirt.

828
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,120
 I think he was wearing shorts on the tube as well.

829
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:40,920
 Oh no.

830
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:41,640
 He took off his shirt.

831
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:42,840
 Ash does wear shorts.

832
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,760
 I mean, you didn't used to wear on the pants either.

833
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:45,480
 Yeah, exactly.

834
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:50,200
 They probably had to close down that line for a day, I would say.

835
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,160
 Yeah, cross the line.

836
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:53,080
 Anyway, hey Ash, if you're listening.

837
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:55,880
 Yeah, did you authorise that story to go out?

838
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,600
 So yeah, California prune bar did all this, didn't they?

839
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,840
 And they also came up with the idea

840
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:03,240
 of adding prunes to all burgers in U.S. schools.

841
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:04,600
 Really?

842
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:05,320
 What? Weird.

843
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:06,840
 Yeah, so the idea was...

844
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:08,920
 Sorry, as part of the mince mixture

845
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:10,520
 or a layer on top of the tomato.

846
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:12,360
 Oh, no, part of the mixture.

847
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:13,960
 So the kids wouldn't know it was in there.

848
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:17,720
 And the idea is it's a way to sort of get vegetables

849
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:20,360
 into kids' diets without them knowing.

850
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:22,360
 Sounds like you're trying to prank all the kids

851
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:24,120
 and make them all shit themselves in the lunch room,

852
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:24,760
 doesn't it?

853
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,040
 Well, you know, they did it.

854
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:26,840
 They did it.

855
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:27,320
 They did it.

856
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:28,200
 Yeah, it was a big thing.

857
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,360
 It was called prune the fat, they called it.

858
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:30,600
 Nice.

859
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:34,120
 And the USDA bought 10 million pounds worth of prunes.

860
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,520
 In 2003 to put into school lunches.

861
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:39,320
 Really? Wow.

862
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:42,920
 And the whole project finished in about 2006

863
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:46,440
 due to a sudden drop in plum production.

864
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:46,920
 Right.

865
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:47,640
 Wow.

866
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:48,840
 So there was just some problem.

867
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:49,960
 There might have been a drought,

868
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:52,040
 or there might have been some disease or something.

869
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:54,200
 And they just couldn't make enough plums

870
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,880
 and so they stopped putting them in burgers.

871
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:59,000
 Does anyone know why they have this laxative effect?

872
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,760
 Because plums, to plums in particular,

873
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,120
 is it just dried fruit in general?

874
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:03,320
 It's just fibrous.

875
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,400
 No, it's partly fibrous.

876
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,920
 I did happen to look into this

877
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:09,400
 because I'm particularly grateful to prunes, personally.

878
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,640
 And I don't think it should be a source of shame.

879
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:11,880
 Okay.

880
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:15,960
 So they are high in fibrous because they're dried fruit,

881
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:16,680
 which is very useful.

882
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:19,240
 But they also contain this thing called sorbetal,

883
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:22,280
 which has a laxative effect.

884
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,600
 And sorbetal, you may recognize the name.

885
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:25,240
 I do.

886
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,600
 It's not in chewing gum.

887
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:27,640
 It's in chewing gum.

888
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,720
 It's the sweetener in sugar-free chewing gum,

889
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,880
 which means that if you look at sugar-free chewing gum,

890
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:33,080
 there's often a warning on it.

891
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,000
 Apparently, saying if you have to...

892
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
 Don't eat two packs of this if you're on the tube.

893
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,560
 It's along those lines and there's a picture of Ash.

894
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:45,560
 You know, I used to eat a lot of chewing gum.

895
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:47,800
 And I stopped because I read the article about them

896
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,480
 putting microplastics in your body.

897
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:50,120
 Oh, yeah, right.

898
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:51,320
 Ah, isn't that weird?

899
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:52,120
 Does it?

900
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:52,840
 Yeah, it does.

901
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,360
 And I don't think it does you any harm,

902
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,120
 but just something about that gave me the echo

903
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,160
 and I just stopped using that.

904
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:59,080
 But you're meant to spit the chewing gum out, right?

905
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:00,040
 Have you been swallowing it?

906
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:00,680
 Like, you're swallowing it.

907
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:01,160
 You are allowed.

908
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,520
 Well, you are allowed to swallow chewing gum.

909
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:03,480
 No, it's not that.

910
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,400
 It's the crunchy bit on the outside.

911
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,080
 Okay, the shell kind of exits way in.

912
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:07,960
 That makes sense.

913
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:09,080
 Oh, do you not cut yours open

914
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,840
 and knife and fork out the meat?

915
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:13,240
 You're not meant to eat the shell.

916
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,400
 That's like, it's like a lobster.

917
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,880
 You get your special chewing gum fork.

918
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:21,240
 Yeah, you were a bit, don't you, Andy,

919
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,360
 when you're eating chewing gum?

920
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:31,000
 Okay, that is it.

921
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,040
 That is all of our facts.

922
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,400

00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:03,000
 I did hear you snigger when I said that.

939
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,160
 Yeah, so or head to our website.

940
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:06,840
 No such thing as a fish.com.

941
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,280
 Plenty of stuff up there for you to check out,

942
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,480
 all of our previous episodes.

943
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,160
 We have a link to an upcoming live show

944
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:13,240
 that we're doing in Sheffield in July

945
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,520
 at the CrossWires Festival.

946
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:17,000
 There's the portal, the gateway to Club Fish,

947
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,880
 the very exciting land where bonus episodes exist,

948
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:22,200
 the compilations, the mailbag episodes.

949
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,040
 Andy goes through all the emails that you send in

950
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:25,240
 and we pick out the best ones

951
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,400
 to talk about the facts you've sent in and so on.

952
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,560
 So do check that out if you're not already a member.

953
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,800
 There's also bits of merchandise you can find there

954
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,560
 or just come back here next week

955
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,800
 because we will have another episode waiting for you.

956
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,000
 We will see you then.

957
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:37,560
 Goodbye.

958
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:40,120
 (upbeat music)

959
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:42,700
 (upbeat music)

960
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:46,220
 (upbeat music)

961
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:48,800
 (upbeat music)
