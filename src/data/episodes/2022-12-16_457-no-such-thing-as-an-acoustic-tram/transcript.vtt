00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.300
 (upbeat music)

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.540
 - Hi everybody, just before we start this week's show,

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.380
 we know that Christmas is on the way

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.660
 and if you are hoping to do any Christmas shopping

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.260
 for the fish fan in your life,

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.860
 then we have some last minute recommendations

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.260
 that will save your bacon and save Christmas.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.500
 - Yes, my first bacon saving recommendation

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.260
 is that you buy two books immediately

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.540
 by the sanctuary by some random

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.100
 called Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.900
 - Yes, me. - That's this guy.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.540
 Look, it goes against all my principles

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.700
 to say this, I don't even necessarily like the guy,

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.060
 but it really is a brilliant book.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.900
 It's got amazing reviews.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.100
 It's gripping, it's about this remote island

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.140
 owned by a mysterious billionaire.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.420
 It's very twisty, turny, thriller.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.900
 It's fantastic and once you've done that,

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.780
 go and buy The Theory of Everything Else

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.060
 by a certain Dan Schreiber, very different kind of book.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.300
 It's like getting inside Dan Schreiber's head,

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.780
 but in a really fun way.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.220
 It's not as chaotic as you'd imagine.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.100
 It's full of the amazing theories

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.780
 that geniuses have come up with

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.580
 that you definitely won't have heard of.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.060
 It's a fascinating fact in every paragraph basically.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.280
 So get those.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.820
 - Absolutely, and alternatively,

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.380
 you can get Christmas goodies

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.220
 from no such thing as a fish.com.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.140
 We have just launched two new t-shirts

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.540
 along with lovely pin badges.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.540
 You can identify other fish listeners in the wild

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.620
 slash public by getting yourself one of these two things.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.100
 There's also a lovely tour book

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.380
 from the recent tour we've just finished

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.100
 which is a complete history and demonology

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.180
 and future guide to fish and all its iterations.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.500
 They're all so much fun

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.420
 and you can get them at nosuchthingasafish.com.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.340
 - Yep, that's right.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.780
 And now we will see this vlogging presence to you

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.060
 and say on with the show.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.220
 - On with the podcast.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.800
 (upbeat music)

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.540
 (upbeat music)

00:01:47.540 --> 00:02:01.620
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.240
 of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.220
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.360
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.480
 I'm sitting here with James Harkin,

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.880
 Anna Tyshinski and Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.720
 And once again,

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.360
 we have gathered around the microphones

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.200
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.680
 and in a particular order, here we go.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.760
 Starting with fact number one and that is Anna.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.520
 - My fact this week is that many of the Muppets

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.320
 were designed and created by someone called Kermit Love

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.640
 who had absolutely nothing to do with Kermit the Frog.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.160
 - When you say had nothing to do with Kermit the Frog,

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.040
 that's literal.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.000
 It's not figuratively,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 I will have nothing to do with Kermit the Frog.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.880
 - Had huge beef from the start.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.360
 Yeah, yeah, big falling out.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.960
 - I think huge beef was Mr. Snuffle Upchut, you see.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.840
 (laughing)

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.200
 - No, he just, he wasn't involved in the making of him.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.840
 So Kermit Love was a designer and builder of Muppets.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.400
 He was most famous probably for doing Big Bird.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.280
 Was his big hit.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.240
 But, you know, lots of the other ones.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.840
 Snuffle Upchut, I think.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.840
 Oscar the Grouch, the Cookie Monster.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.800
 But Kermit was created about 10 years

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.560
 before he even thought about joining the Muppets.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.040
 And they're just both called Kermit,

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.360
 which I think must have been a more common name.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.680
 - It was, Mark. - And it was.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.520
 - Yeah, definitely.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.680
 - 'Cause there was one of the presidents

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.960
 had a son called Kermit, didn't he?

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.320
 - Yeah, Kermit Rose.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.800
 - Three years old, I think, so.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.120
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.480
 - I don't think he designed Big Bird.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.480
 I think he helped to create the design.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.480
 So there was a sort of drawing and he was,

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.480
 they couldn't make it work.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.360
 And there are just so many design flaws in it.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.960
 So they needed Kermit to come in.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:36.800
 - Co-designed.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.640
 - Co-designed.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.480
 - Oh, what do you think?

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.240
 - It was manufactured, I guess, isn't it?

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.600
 - Basically, Jim Henson would draw what he wanted, I guess.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.960
 And then he'd give it to people like Kermit Love,

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.280
 who was the main person on Big Bird,

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.400
 and say, "Can you make this?"

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.040
 And then he'd try and make it as close as possible,

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.880
 I suppose.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.440
 - One thing about Kermit Love was that he had

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.280
 all this amazing experience of puppets

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.160
 and costumes before he joined the Muppet Show, obviously.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.480
 So one of the things he'd worked on

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.440
 was spangling the girls at the Paris Lido.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.600
 So, ballet.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.720
 - That's a euphemism, isn't it?

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.240
 (laughing)

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.320
 Where were you last night?

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.560
 Were you spangling the girls at the Paris Lido?

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.120
 (laughing)

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.960
 - Lido as well.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.720
 It's such a weird word in English, but.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.800
 - What about the Lido?

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.920
 - It's quite a common word.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.240
 - Yeah, Lido's a very common word.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.760
 - I don't think that it was an open-air swimming pool.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:19.960
 - No, that was the confusion.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:20.920
 (laughing)

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.040
 - So, all--

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.520
 - So he's not spangling girls who are paying

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.480
 five pounds for a swim?

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.600
 - No, no, no, exactly.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.680
 No, he was working with ballet dancers a lot of the time.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.600
 So he worked for the New York City Ballet,

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.560
 and he specialised there on turning humans

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.760
 into half puppets.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:33.600
 - Oh, did he?

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.440
 - That was a big part of his--

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.320
 - And of course, that's what Big Bird is, right?

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.160
 - Right, yeah.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.760
 - It's half human, half puppet,

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:39.800
 unlike the other Muppets

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.000
 that are kind of actual, classic puppets.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.840
 - Exactly.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.040
 Well, Big What 'cause there's a human inside, do you mean?

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.880
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:45.720
 - Wow. - Yeah, sorry.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.560
 (laughing)

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.400
 - No, you're right, sorry.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.040
 - I think when the character dies one day, Big Bird,

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.400
 they should do a live autopsy,

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.520
 and all the Muppets freak out

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.440
 when they find a human inside.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.640
 (laughing)

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.320
 - The design that Henson sent

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.880
 apparently didn't have feathers.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.600
 Kermit Love added those.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.420
 But that's weird, isn't it?

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:03.520
 To have a bird without any feathers.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.280
 - Yeah, don't try to think of any actual birds

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.120
 without feathers.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.960
 - I don't think there are any.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.640
 - A pterodactyl, I suppose, is the early, you know.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.200
 - A pterodactyl isn't a bird.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.280
 Dinosaurs are birds, and yet pterodactyls aren't.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.120
 - That's a weird thing.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.480
 - I guess think of Cookie Monster, right?

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.720
 Like, I know he's not feathered,

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.120
 but the material could look,

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.200
 I could imagine a Big Bird

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.600
 with that kind of felt material, or whatever it is.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.840
 - What I wondered is,

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.880
 the one birds that don't have feathers

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.600
 is really, really young, pre-fledgedlings,

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.120
 like little chicks, right?

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.760
 So maybe he's a really baby, that Big Bird,

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.240
 and he will grow up into something even bigger.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.080
 - Yeah, that's good.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.360
 - Does he seem quite immature?

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.200
 'Cause I've never actually seen--

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.560
 - He's actually six years old, isn't he?

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.120
 - Six years old, I love that.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.960
 But there's an amazing detail that Kermit Love

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.600
 went overseas to China for a filming,

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.960
 and they took Big Bird and Big Bird,

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.360
 like the costume, 'cause they were doing that,

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.880
 but Big Bird was given a seat on the plane,

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.600
 and because he's six years old,

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.520
 the Chinese airline charged him half price.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.360
 - Fair enough, yeah.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.640
 - Well, no, what's fascinating about that is,

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.040
 I can't believe that you used to get

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.200
 half price tickets for children,

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.640
 because I don't pay so much money.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.760
 Any time one of my million kids turns two years old.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.120
 - Why don't you put the child in a Big Bird costume?

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.600
 - Fly them to China and make it a big publicity thing,

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.880
 which is why they actually did this.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.800
 - Exactly, yeah, you need more publicity,

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.760
 that's what we're doing.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.680
 Big Bird is in a way the opposite of Tinky Winky.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.520
 - Oh, yeah.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.160
 - Okay, can you work out why?

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.800
 - Well, Tinky Winky, giant purple deli-tubby,

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.040
 famously gay, carries a handbag.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.480
 - TV on his stomach.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.320
 - Thank you.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.760
 - TV on his stomach.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.880
 - You did all the legwork, James,

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.080
 and Anna just came in, came in at the end.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.200
 - I think I know deli-tubby's too well,

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.600
 because they all have TVs on their stomachs,

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.480
 and I was going about what differentiates him

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.320
 from the other TV's.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.400
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm really sorry.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.440
 I should have said the opposite of a deli-tubby,

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.320
 but it's the, where Tinky Winky has a TV

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.480
 on the outside of his stomach,

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.480
 Big Bird has a TV on the inside of his stomach.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.320
 - Really?

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.880
 - For the puppeteer to see what he's doing.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:56.720
 - Wow.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.560
 - Oh, that makes sense.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.240
 - He just needs, basically, and it's below,

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.560
 it's a small TV monitor,

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.160
 and he just has to look down at what is going on

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.000
 on the monitor to see what's going on outside.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.080
 - 'Cause I read that as well,

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.160
 but what I read didn't go into any more details.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.280
 It said so he could see the set,

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.400
 and I couldn't work out whether the TV would be,

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.800
 give you a projection from Big Bird's eyes,

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.520
 in which case, have to have cameras in his eyes.

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:17.360
 - Yeah.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.480
 - Or you're seeing the actual set,

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.520
 as in you're seeing yourself from, like, the third person.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.360
 - Good call.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.680
 - And that must be difficult, right?

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.520
 - Yeah.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.720
 - To know where to walk if you're seeing yourself on TV.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.520
 - Yeah, you'd have to invert left and right, wouldn't you?

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.480
 - Yeah, that's probably the least of your problems.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.800
 I don't know, really.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.760
 - It's like being a ghost when you leave your own body

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.600
 after you die, and then you look back at it.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.920
 - Oh, yes.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.280
 - It's not like you have to control your body then,

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.120
 so you don't have the difficulty.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.080
 - That's why ghosts always walk through walls,

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.360
 'cause they don't know which way they're going,

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.720
 and they're like, "Oh, shit, I just walked through a wall."

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.560
 - Just very quickly back to Kermit Love.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.640
 So one of the innovations that he brought

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.320
 to the design of Big Bird was malting.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.760
 So he allowed for the feathers to drop off Big Bird,

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.200
 so it looked like, I don't know,

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.520
 like they were real feathers that could fall off,

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.120
 which was really, really nice.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:05.960
 - Absolutely look real.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.680
 - And he used 6,000 dyed feathers

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.280
 from a domestic white turkey, not a single one,

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.280
 in order to make the suit.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.280
 - Oh, the suit's made of actual turkey feathers.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.040
 - I think in the initial period,

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.560
 it's probably very different now.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:22.560
 - Kermit Love, he usually spoke with a fake English accent,

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.840
 sometimes with a fake French accent.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.160
 - I do the fake English accent thing.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.880
 I'm like, "Yeah, you're actually, where are you from?"

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:30.840
 - I'm from Guatemala.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.560
 (laughing)

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:33.800
 - And how do they speak, normally?

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.680
 - I can't, well, I'm not going to give up the accent now.

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:37.280
 - You can't break character.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.080
 (laughing)

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.160
 - He made Big Bird with a guy called Christopher Lyle,

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.800
 who he was in a relationship with for over 50 years.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.040
 So I think from before he,

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.520
 they started making Big Bird together, right?

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.240
 Until Kermit died in 2008.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.400
 - Yeah, Christopher Lyle was in the pilot for the Muppet Show.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.060
 - Yeah, so like right at the very, very start.

00:08:58.060 --> 00:08:59.600
 - I looked at his IMDb because I thought,

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.920
 "Oh, what a cool guy, he seems like Christopher Lyle."

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.840
 And it led me to a fact that I didn't know,

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.880
 which is there were two pilots for the Muppet Show.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.280
 So one, very kid-friendly.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:10.280
 The second pilot was called the Muppet Show,

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:11.440
 Sex and Violence.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.280
 (laughing)

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.960
 I was the second ever Muppet Pilot.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.240
 - And did you see what it was about?

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.000
 - I couldn't find too much information on it, actually.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.800
 - Well, it was a parody of the fact

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.240
 that there was starting to get lots of sex and violence

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.560
 on television, so people were complaining.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.480
 And so they were parodying lots of different things

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.720
 that were happening on TV at the time.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:29.560
 - Okay, right.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:30.400
 - So it's not fully, it's not-

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.960
 - It wasn't, there wasn't, yeah.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:32.800
 - Still on an sexy title.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:34.800
 - Still sounds like it's not for six-year-olds.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.240
 - Big Bird wasn't banging Mr. Snumpluffers.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.760
 - Yeah, exactly, that's what I'd expect.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.000
 - I thought it was just like, yeah.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.240
 The other thing is how physically injurious it is

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.320
 to be a Muppeteer, one of the men.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.880
 Yeah, yeah, and this is partly because of something.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.440
 Oh, oh, I've got another quiz link.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.280
 - Why did you just interrupt yourself then?

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.680
 - It's gonna be very hard to edit around that.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:56.520
 - You're absolutely right.

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:57.360
 - What's the quiz link?

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.800
 - What you need to know, so what we-

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.520
 - I feel like we missed a lot of steps in your head.

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.280
 - And you need to calm down.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.800
 - No, I'm so excited to be talking about Muppets.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:06.920
 I love the Muppets so much.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:07.760
 - Do you?

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.960
 - There's one link between Muppets

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.840
 and something that we covered recently,

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.520
 which is Disneyland, when Jamie was on,

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:15.720
 we mentioned Disneyland, right?

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.240
 And there's a link between Disneyland

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.080
 and the world of the Muppets.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.400
 - And the world of the Muppets, okay.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.680
 - I prefer that you don't mention shows

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:21.520
 when I wasn't there.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.840
 - Oh, is it something about the acknowledgement

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.000
 of characters in real life?

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.920
 You have to talk to them as if they're real?

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:27.760
 - No, that's not it.

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.520
 - I think you said, you started off that sentence

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:30.920
 before you had the stroke,

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.440
 and you were talking about the puppeteers.

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.280
 - Yes.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.120
 - So it's something to do with the puppeteers.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:34.960
 - Something to do with the puppeteers, yeah.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:35.800
 - Oh, okay.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.640
 Oh, they have a secret tunnels.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:38.760
 - I'm gonna say that's it.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:42.120
 Muppet filming land is actually on the first floor.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.160
 It's about eight feet above the ground

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.960
 so that the Muppeteers can stand upright.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.480
 But the problem is, some of the Muppeteers are quite short,

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.520
 so then they need to wear platform shoes

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.880
 to get them up to the level that they've been also up to.

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.120
 And this brings me back to the point

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.520
 about Muppeteers also being physically injured.

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.120
 So the guy who plays Gonzo the Great,

00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.440
 he's still going actually.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.640
 He's had to have four shoulder operations

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.200
 just due to holding up your hand all the time

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.520
 and doing a hip replacement.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.280
 And, you know, you're crimped.

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.160
 - The sacrifice people make is heroic.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.600
 Guys, when you're operating a Muppet mouth,

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.400
 imagine you're doing that with your arm up it.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.480
 Show me what you do.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:19.200
 I know you can't see this at home,

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.640
 but you've all got it wrong.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:21.880
 - You're choking.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:22.960
 - Whatever you are doing at home,

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.520
 we reckon that's probably wrong as well.

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.280
 - I think it's unlikely you've got it right.

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.880
 - I'm doing a mouth with my hand, we all are.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:31.720
 - But the key is, is that how mouth move, guys?

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.920
 What bit of your mouth do you move when you're talking?

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:34.840
 - Your lips.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.680
 - Which lip?

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:37.600
 - Is it the bottom?

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.160
 - Is it you're moving your jaw?

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.840
 - So you say you move only the bottom?

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.320
 - You move only your thumb.

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.960
 This is what one of the operators said,

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:45.800
 I was watching an interview with him,

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.720
 he said, you've got to keep your top of your hand still

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:48.880
 and you move only your thumb.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:49.880
 - That shit could have sweared.

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.600
 Hello, I'm a buyer.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.560
 - Yeah, that does not work.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:53.400
 - It's Pac-Man.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.480
 That's how Pac-Man moves, right?

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.120
 - Does Pac-Man have, yes, he uses the two.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:57.960
 - Because Pac-Man's going,

00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.200
 (mimics Pac-Man)

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.040
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:00.920
 - We've got an aerial view,

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:01.920
 most likely of Pac-Man's eyes.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.120
 - Well, why is he sideways?

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.200
 - Yeah, it doesn't make any sense.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.760
 - We're about to play this thing wider.

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:06.960
 - Is he grinding along the floor?

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.080
 - If we've got an aerial view,

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.920
 he's just on the floor sideways, isn't he?

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.480
 - Yeah, but he's a disembodied head, right?

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:12.320
 Like, he's not human.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:14.000
 - So why sideways? We shouldn't be able to see anything

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.080
 of his mouth movement from above.

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:15.920
 - He should just be a circle.

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:16.760
 - Yeah.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:18.880
 - No, unless he's from a species with a side with his mouth.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:19.720
 What are you talking about?

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.480
 - Oh, you think he has a mouth on the side of his head?

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.160
 - Possibly, he's an alien.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.000
 - He's an alien?

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:24.840
 - He's not an alien.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.640
 - Well, he's not a human.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:27.920
 - A man implies human.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.640
 - Wait, no, sorry.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:33.240
 In later illustrations, he has legs, shoes, arms and gloves.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.400
 So, yeah.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.480
 - Like the M&M's, like the Cartoon M&M's.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.760
 - Just like that.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.240
 - Also wearing gloves.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.080
 - Same universe?

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:41.920
 - Clearly they're related.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.640
 - Am I thinking of the yellow M&M?

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.680
 - Oh, bloody hell, Dan.

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:46.520
 - You are, aren't you?

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:47.360
 - It might be.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.680
 - No, I'm pretty sure Pac-Man has legs.

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:49.880
 - They do cartoons, as well, of Pac-Man.

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:50.720
 - Yeah.

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:51.560
 - In the '90s.

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:52.400
 - I didn't know that.

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:53.920
 - Is it because, do they have to have the gloves?

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:56.600
 Because it's weird seeing his hands.

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.400
 Like, the gloves are kind of effectively, it's sort of...

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.040
 - Well, the same as Mickey Mouse, right?

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:00.880
 - Yeah.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:01.720
 - Why do you have gloves?

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:02.560
 - Why are all these...

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:03.760
 - He's always at a prime scene.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.160
 (all laughing)

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.800
 - He's a snooker referee in his spare time.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.880
 Mickey Mouse is the lead.

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.880
 - Oh, boy! What a shot!

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.320
 - That's not what referees do.

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:16.160
 (all laughing)

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.000
 - That's why I just...

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.640
 They're not hype men.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:19.960
 Come on, you man!

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.540
 (upbeat music)

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:29.000
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.800
 - My fact is that the German army has just had to tear out

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.480
 some of the size labels from their new uniforms

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:38.080
 because they read small, short, or SS.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:38.920
 - Ooh.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:39.760
 - Yeah.

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:40.960
 - Oh.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:41.800
 - Oversight.

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:42.840
 (all laughing)

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.280
 - A lot of small, short people in the German army.

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:47.920
 - Well, not that many, but one is too many

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.080
 to have the SS label in their clothes.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:50.920
 - I agree.

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:53.000
 - So, yeah, most of them were small, medium, large,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.640
 and extra large, and that's fine.

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.680
 But the SS stands for the Schuttstaffel,

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.400
 who are the Nazi paramilitary organization

00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.720
 who largely ran the Holocaust.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.360
 And it is literally illegal to display their symbols

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:03.680
 in Germany.

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.080
 So the German defense ministry had ordered the soldiers

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.080
 to tear out the SS lettering.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.600
 I mean, they weren't on display either.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.360
 It was literally just a size label in some--

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.520
 - Unless you're wearing it inside out,

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.440
 which often, if you get up in the dark,

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.040
 put your clothes on, that's suddenly on display.

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.840
 - I think that's an offence on the parade ground, though,

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.080
 to have your uniform inside out.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.440
 I don't know much about military discipline,

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.280
 but I imagine--

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.040
 - I imagine they say, get down and give me 10

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.040
 if you do that.

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:25.680
 Yeah, pretty sure.

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:28.080
 - They said if you cut it out, that's one thing.

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.400
 But if it's got important information on it,

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:32.200
 what you should do is cut around the SS,

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.200
 so just lose the actual--

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.040
 - They didn't say that.

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:34.880
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:37.080
 - So it's still the shape of an S and an S.

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.320
 (all laughing)

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:41.400
 - Not important information is going to be on an S.

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.240
 - The washing instructions.

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:43.080
 - The washing, yeah.

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.960
 - You know, what if you accidentally put it in at 60?

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.880
 - No one's ever read those on any item of clothing.

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.600
 - Oh, excuse me, I'm not strong this way.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:50.880
 (all laughing)

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:52.680
 It's my regular reading.

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.360
 Regular reading.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.200
 You're getting a shirt.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.640
 Oh, I can't wait to read this.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.440
 - Can I ask, what is the German for small shorts?

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.520
 Presumably it's SS in German.

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:05.880
 - Well, that would be KK, which is Clyde, Clyde.

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:06.720
 - So how come--

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.560
 - Is it English?

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:08.680
 - I think the supplier would have been

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:11.600
 English language and that's why it was a problem.

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.840
 - KK is still, what isn't it?

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:15.320
 'Cause you do feel, you sense that lingering third K.

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.720
 - If you're a really, really small soldier

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:18.560
 (all laughing)

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:20.680
 and you're a KKK, that is a problem.

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:21.520
 - I didn't realize that though

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.960
 about the SS being a combination of words

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.520
 that is banned in certain places.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.360
 Like one of the things which was in the article

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:30.560
 that you sent around Andy was that SS on number plates

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.640
 is not allowed in most spots in Germany.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:33.480
 - Is that right?

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:36.640
 - Yes, you can't have SS, you can't have KZ

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.640
 because that references concentration camps.

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:41.040
 You can't have HJ because that's the Hitler youth,

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:41.880
 you can't have--

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:42.720
 - I'm sorry.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:43.600
 - Yeah, because there are German words.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.400
 Yeah, it doesn't sound like it makes sense,

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:46.240
 but--

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.640
 - HJ is also a rude thing.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.000
 - I like hand jobby sinking.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:50.840
 - Oh!

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.240
 - What's handjob in German though?

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.400
 - Actually testing my GCSE German now.

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:55.240
 (all laughing)

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.800
 It actually didn't come up either in the--

00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:58.640
 - Not in the aural.

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:01.440
 (all laughing)

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:02.800
 - I found some German military uniforms

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.360
 which are literally made of cardboard,

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.040
 which is an interesting thing.

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:07.320
 And it's not in Germany.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:10.560
 It's in Namibia, which was a German colony

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:13.040
 until after the First World War.

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.400
 And there is a group of people living there,

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.960
 the Herrero tribe.

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:19.360
 And I think though, like a lot of colonized people

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:20.640
 is treated pretty badly.

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:22.080
 - Genocide, I believe.

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:22.920
 - Right.

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:24.240
 - Yeah, all the way, all the way to genocide.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.600
 - One of the worst ways to be treated.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:29.080
 - Yes, well the Herrero people now

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.680
 wear a lot of Edwardian European,

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:35.720
 specifically German clothing for traditional rituals

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.360
 and for special days and things like that.

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.120
 So if you go to a Herrero funeral,

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.440
 the women will be wearing Edwardian dresses

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:44.720
 that were popular in Germany in 1910.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:47.040
 And the men will be wearing uniforms

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.320
 that are some of them made of cardboard

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:52.160
 because they've been replicated to be exactly like

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.320
 the fashions of that time.

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:55.840
 - And it's really similar to the Bolivian Cholitas

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.240
 that we talked about a few weeks ago.

00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:59.400
 And also it was the women who adopted this first

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:00.880
 by some way, I think they adopted

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.400
 the European style of dress,

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.160
 but then much like the Cholitas,

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:08.360
 they made it much more full of bright colors

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:09.840
 like the clothes that they wore.

00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:11.640
 So yeah, and they've got these beautiful hybrid

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:15.680
 Edwardian dresses with these colorful colors on them.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:16.520
 - That's awesome.

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:19.680
 - You know, Germany gave Namibia $1.35 billion

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.880
 in a couple of years ago, I think it was.

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:22.920
 I just thought that was very interesting

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:24.760
 when people talk about compensating.

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.040
 In compensation, they said this was a genocide

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:29.560
 and his $1.5 billion to develop.

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:30.880
 So 1.3 times.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.760
 - I wonder what you get in the Herrero embassy

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.080
 whenever you go there.

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:37.480
 (all laughing)

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:38.320
 - Wait, I don't get it.

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:41.840
 - So what do you get for a year at an embassy party?

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.480
 There's someone going around with a tray.

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.160
 - I get it, I get it, I get it.

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.160
 Yeah, yeah, it's a quality stream.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.440
 (all laughing)

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:52.960
 - Have we mentioned this about French military uniforms

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.760
 and Napoleon and the baguette?

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.840
 - Yeah, yeah, supposedly the baguette was invented

00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.160
 so you could hide it in your trousers.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.000
 - Oh, that's right.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:00.840
 Yeah, we have talked about that.

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:01.680
 - Hopefully, okay.

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:02.520
 - Sort of like hidden down the inside.

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:04.280
 - But it would just fit in the trouser pockets

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:05.120
 of the army uniform.

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:06.440
 I just couldn't remember if we'd--

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.560
 - Can I just say, well, we're talking about Napoleon

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.520
 and we might not keep all this in anyway

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:11.960
 'cause we have mentioned it before.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:15.160
 But this morning, I was reading a book about cannibalism

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:17.880
 and there was a nursery rhyme in it.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.880
 And apparently it was a genuine nursery rhyme.

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.640
 Baby, baby, naughty baby.

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.000
 Hush you, squalling thing, I say.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.080
 Peace this moment.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:30.040
 Peace, or maybe, Bonaparte will pass this way.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:32.560
 And he'll beat you, beat you, beat you.

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.680
 And he'll beat you all to pop.

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.720
 And he'll eat you, eat you, eat you.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:39.160
 Every morsel, snap, snap, snap.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.360
 - Not sure about this bedtime story

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:42.360
 when you're waiting for your daughter.

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:45.440
 - And I will be appearing on CBVs tomorrow evening

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.760
 for the bedtime story.

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.760
 - So yeah, they made the uniform

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.280
 so you could put a baguette in your pocket

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:52.480
 and then you could always do the joke.

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:54.480
 Is that a gun in your pocket or is it?

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.120
 - Or is that a hungry?

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:57.360
 - It's a sandwich, yeah.

00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:00.160
 - Have you read about how modern military uniforms

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.880
 in America are progressing at the moment?

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.760
 It's, they're turning them basically into computers,

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:08.800
 which means that anything that happens on your outfit

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:10.920
 can be reported back to base.

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:14.480
 So if you're shot, your suit will know with a spot

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:15.960
 because it can sense a change.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.840
 - Other computers good enough that they can,

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:18.840
 if the soldier's been shot,

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:21.800
 can the computer make the soldier keep running, basically?

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.120
 - Not yet, see that's like a Robocop.

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.200
 We haven't got to Robocop yet,

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:30.000
 but it can tell GPS, it can tell literally the liquid level

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.760
 of how much heat you're exerting

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:34.120
 and if you're in trouble or whatever.

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:35.640
 It's just got all the information,

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:37.400
 all the data is now being collected.

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:39.000
 - Yeah, yeah, nice.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.800
 - I don't know if they can send it right back overseas, I think.

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:44.160
 - I think if you can send it over the internet

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:45.640
 from one place to another,

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:47.680
 it could probably go all the way around the world.

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:49.800
 - That's not on the internet, right James?

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:50.960
 - It's on this guy.

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:54.960
 - If he wants attached to the Pentagon,

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.920
 it's like a massive cable, it's like a dolly.

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:57.920
 - Pull them out, pull them out,

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.800
 'cause someone literally pulls them all out.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.040
 - I don't know how reassuring it is

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.280
 if someone says to you, "Here's your suit,"

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.120
 and the good thing is,

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:05.120
 when you get shot multiple times in the chest,

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.560
 we'll have a computer back home

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:09.360
 that knows exactly where you've been shot.

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:10.840
 - 'Cause there's a thing called the golden hour

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:12.080
 after a soldier's been injured,

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.080
 which is the time to really,

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:16.080
 whereas you're most likely to save their life.

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:16.920
 And there's also a thing,

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:18.760
 I think, called something like the platinum five minutes,

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:20.720
 which is even more,

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.960
 you can do absolutely the most to save their life.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.920
 And then there's the diamond five seconds,

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:27.800
 where you just put your arm and pull the bullet out,

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:29.920
 and it's like, nothing happened.

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:36.240
 - So why do you think the SAS had so many condoms

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.120
 in the first Gulf War?

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:39.760
 - Okay.

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.840
 - Is it to do with burns?

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.240
 Only 'cause we were once told to bring condoms

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:45.760
 to stop burning, but Dan's got it.

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:47.800
 - It's water, it's water, yep.

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:48.640
 They took loads of condoms

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:50.240
 'cause they can hold about a liter of water each.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.360
 And if you're on the run, it's very useful.

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.200
 If you pass a stream,

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.880
 quickly fill up your condoms with water.

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:55.160
 You've got a liter of water there.

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.560
 - We'll taste quite spermicide-y.

00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:00.200
 - Might be one of the strawberry ones, might get lucky.

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:02.840
 (laughing)

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:04.840
 But then, so that kind of led me on to this.

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:09.840
 In 1991, the British army ordered half a million bespoke

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.120
 camouflage condoms.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:15.320
 - That's a great idea.

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:16.400
 - Can you tell me why?

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:17.240
 - Well.

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.080
 - Sand coloured.

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:18.900
 - Oh, sand coloured.

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:20.240
 - For the Gulf War, that was, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.640
 - If you forget to do up your flies

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:23.960
 after you've been to the Lou,

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:25.720
 you're always wearing a camouflage condom,

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:26.560
 so it doesn't matter.

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:30.880
 - You lie down in the sand with only your penis stick out,

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:32.680
 but you don't want anyone to shoot it.

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:33.520
 (laughing)

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:34.360
 So you have to cover it in a condom.

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.240
 - It's the periscope, it's the, yeah, yeah.

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:37.080
 - Right.

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:39.920
 - It's for the rifles.

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:42.560
 - To cover the rifles, to stop any water getting in.

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:44.800
 - Yeah, and sand did the tip.

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:48.280
 It can be seriously debilitating if you're firing a rifle.

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:50.720
 - At the end of World War I, in New York City,

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:55.720
 they had a tower of 12,000 pickle halbers,

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:59.600
 which are those kind of helmets with a spike on top,

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.680
 you know, like German helmets.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.280
 It was like a victory parade.

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.760
 They got a massive pyramid of these helmets

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:08.800
 in the middle of New York, and then they sold them off.

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:11.080
 But the idea was, look, we've won the war

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:13.280
 and we've got all these trophies and whatever.

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:16.000
 Now the thing is that the Germans

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.160
 didn't really use these helmets.

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:21.280
 They used them in the 19th century,

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:22.960
 but then they were really phased out

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.520
 during the start of the 20th century,

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:27.960
 and they were completely replaced in 1916 by steel helmets

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:29.400
 because they're made of leather,

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.760
 the ones with the spike on.

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:32.480
 They don't help you really in any way.

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:33.320
 - And they're conspicuous as well.

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:35.360
 If you're in a trench and just you can see a spike

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:36.200
 moving back and forth, yeah.

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.040
 - Yeah, they're no use.

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:39.200
 They were replaced by steel helmets,

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.520
 but they had all these old ones,

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.960
 so they put them in an old warehouse,

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:45.160
 and then the Americans captured the warehouse,

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.320
 took all the helmets out,

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.760
 and then showed them as these are our spoils of war,

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:50.400
 as if they'd taken them from the soldiers,

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.120
 but they didn't take them from an old thing.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:52.960
 - Wow, very clever.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:53.800
 - And the reason you had the spike

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:55.720
 is because it's from the older days

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.800
 you might have a big plume on the side,

00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.600
 like a ceremonial helmet,

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.480
 and that was kind of the spike would hold the plume.

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:03.320
 - I was wondering if it was

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:05.480
 the old Ben Franklin lightning rod hat.

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:07.360
 (laughing)

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.200
 - I didn't realize.

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:09.280
 Loads of other armies have them.

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.840
 - Oh yeah, today they have them.

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:14.720
 - Yeah, so the British household cavalry used to have a spike.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.000
 The US Marine Corps, Russian, Swedish.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.240
 - All for plume purposes, is that the--

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:19.800
 - I think almost all, yeah.

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:23.200
 But the Prussian army had changed theirs in 1844.

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:26.240
 They ended in a ball because people kept on

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:29.640
 injuring their horses or damaging equipment or whatever.

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:31.160
 - They think with the lightning rods

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.320
 was you had the spike versus the ball as well, didn't you?

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:34.160
 - Oh yeah.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:36.600
 And maybe lightning kept happening, exactly.

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:37.840
 (laughing)

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:38.680
 Yeah.

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:41.480
 - Interesting, yeah, today I think ceremonially only,

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:44.440
 but you would see them in South America, I think,

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:47.080
 or the Romanian army, maybe.

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:49.040
 - Oh, back in Guatemala, the Tenerpene,

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:50.600
 you'd see them every day.

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:51.640
 (laughing)

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:54.640
 - Have you guys ever seen the Landsknecht mercenaries,

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.640
 pictures of drawings of these?

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:57.480
 - Not sure.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.680
 - These were Germans who fought

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:01.320
 between the 1400s and the 1600s.

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:04.640
 They made up the majority of the Holy Roman Empire.

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:07.200
 They were like the elite fighting force.

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.960
 So they were using mostly pikes and crossbows,

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:13.080
 but they also used these things called zvi henders,

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.440
 which were swords that were way taller

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:16.520
 than the soldier himself.

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:19.520
 So they looked like they're carrying,

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.520
 I mean, you have to carry them over your shoulder

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:22.360
 and it looks ridiculous.

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:23.200
 - That's the point.

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.880
 It must be way too heavy to wheel.

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:25.960
 - I know, I know.

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:29.440
 I think the idea was you could basically get at your enemy

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:30.560
 'cause your sword was longer,

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.360
 but I think it wasn't that practical in the end.

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:35.120
 - You could think in the really early days of warfare,

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:37.200
 when all you had was a sword,

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:39.200
 having a slightly longer sword than your enemy

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:40.320
 would be an advantage.

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:42.240
 - Yeah, yeah, and then it's an arms race, yeah.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.760
 - Eventually you've got a mile long sword.

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:46.040
 - That was what the arms race was.

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:46.880
 It's not so sweet.

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:47.720
 Back in the day, the arms race

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.280
 was just adding a cent to me through our drinks.

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:50.320
 - To your arm, yeah.

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:51.720
 (laughing)

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:54.240
 You breed soldiers with super long arms of actually,

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:58.120
 you know, Mr. Tickle in his time was a ferocious warrior.

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:00.600
 - He had to donate sperm every month, didn't he,

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.080
 for this new legion.

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:04.880
 He was very good at donating sperm.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.960
 It was very easy for him, obviously.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.800
 - I would think it would be quite awkward

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:10.360
 if you're Mr. Tickle, 'cause it's easy

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.840
 to reach things a long way from you, but your own penis.

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:14.640
 - Yeah, you're saying you're so right.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:15.920
 - I don't think we've got any data

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:17.840
 about Mr. Tickle's penis though.

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:20.960
 Was it, you know, is everything that long and tickly?

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:22.180
 (laughing)

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:24.760
 (upbeat music)

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:28.560
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:29.720
 and that is my fact.

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:34.000
 My fact is that in 2015, the actor Vicky McClure

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.560
 was kicked off the Vicky McClure tram

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:37.800
 for not having a ticket.

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:41.240
 - So, I think she shouldn't have to have a ticket

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:42.400
 if the tram's named after her.

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.320
 - Turned out she didn't need to have a tram ticket.

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:46.440
 Just the ticket inspector didn't realize that

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:48.160
 and kicked her off for their evasion.

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:51.000
 So Nottingham is where this tram is,

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.640
 and it's the Nottingham Express Transit,

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.360
 and they have a lot of trams

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:58.120
 that have a lot of local hero names on it.

00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:59.440
 Vicky McClure and--

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:00.520
 - Who is she, sorry?

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:01.440
 - She's, oh yeah, sorry.

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.280
 So Vicky McClure is an actor.

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.000
 You might have seen her in line of duty.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.720
 You might have seen her in the replacement.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:07.560
 You might have seen her.

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:09.240
 - She's-- - The replacement bus journey?

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:11.760
 (laughing)

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:16.360
 - She's a very big British actor, yeah, huge deal.

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:19.800
 And yeah, so in 2015, she was offered this

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:21.360
 for it to be named after her.

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:22.960
 She accepted it, she's very excited.

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:24.880
 She brought her mother along to the ceremony.

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:27.040
 She sort of officially unveiled it,

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:29.800
 got onto the tram for the inaugural ride,

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:31.480
 and then the conductor said, "Where's your ticket?"

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:34.040
 And she said, "I don't have one on Vicky McClure."

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:36.120
 And he said, "Yeah, we're all Vicky McClure, get off."

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:39.360
 - And yeah. - Nottingham has a lot of

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:41.360
 trams named after people. - There's a lot of them.

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:42.760
 - There's a lot of them.

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:44.400
 So I'm gonna say a few names.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.240
 Martin Polyakov, scientist.

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.800
 - Yes. - Big deal scientist.

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:50.520
 D.H. Lawrence, sex writer.

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:55.040
 Krzysztof Brot, tour villain dean.

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:56.520
 I don't know if that's one tram or two, actually.

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.360
 - It's one, yeah. - Shame.

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:01.040
 - Who gets the front half and who gets the back half?

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:02.320
 - Trams, trams.

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.880
 Okay, did you know that there's an annual

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.560
 tram bowling competition every year?

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:08.560
 - We sure did.

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:09.720
 (laughing)

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.000
 - But tell us more. - Pretty exciting.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.320
 So every year there is the European

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:14.360
 tram driver competition, which is a competition

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:16.600
 which sees tram drivers from all over Europe

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:18.520
 gathering together to compete against each other

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:20.920
 to find the greatest tram driver of all.

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:22.840
 They do things like trams billiards.

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:24.000
 They do tram bowling.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.640
 So tram bowling would be, you've got giant pins

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:28.360
 that are at the end of a little track,

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:30.200
 and you've got a tram racing down,

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:31.680
 and two people are holding the ball,

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.440
 and it nudges the ball, and it tries to not.

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:34.920
 It's a huge inflatable ball.

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:36.120
 It's not your average bowling ball.

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:37.760
 - No. - I think what's interesting is

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.840
 that's quite obvious what that would be,

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:42.080
 but tram billiards on the other hand.

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:43.640
 - Good point. - Which you haven't explained.

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.120
 - No, I'm-- - Tram billiards,

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:47.000
 I couldn't tell you what tram billiards is.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.040
 Tram billiards doesn't bid that much

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:50.480
 relation to actual billiards,

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:54.200
 but it looks like a really boring spectator sport.

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:58.120
 It is where a tram goes very slowly and cautiously

00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:02.200
 towards a table, which has got lots of scores written on it,

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.600
 and coming out of the table is kind of a channel

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:06.240
 with a little ball at the end,

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:08.480
 and the tram nudges into the channel

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.280
 and knocks the ball onto the table,

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:12.320
 and whatever score the ball lands on.

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:13.840
 - Oh, so it's shuffleboard.

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:15.800
 Shuffleboard isn't-- - Yeah, or shove-hateney.

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:17.000
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I like that.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.400
 - But there are more exciting events than that,

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:19.240
 even more exciting.

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:22.360
 There's stopping within 20 centimetres of a cone

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:23.480
 without hitting it. - Yeah, pretty cool.

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:26.040
 - That's good. (laughing)

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:28.800
 - What does that entail? (laughing)

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:31.200
 - Accelerate to exactly 30 kilometres an hour

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:33.000
 without a speedometer.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:33.840
 That's pretty good.

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:36.560
 - How do they remove the speedometer from this?

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.480
 - I don't know if it's quite a technical thing.

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:40.280
 - I think you put some black masking tape

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:41.600
 over it or something. - That's not what it says.

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.200
 It says without the speedometer.

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.360
 - Yeah, yeah, they have to commission hundreds

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:48.280
 of new trams every year for this.

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:50.880
 - It's the most expensive sport in Europe.

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:53.360
 - Yeah, so trams, when I was reading about this,

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:55.800
 I realized trams were much more revolutionary

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:58.200
 than I had realised, and I think we said that a lot,

00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.320
 but it is true.

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:04.320
 So they were the way that you got around for about 100 years.

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:07.040
 - They still are in some places.

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:08.480
 - But there wasn't other options,

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.080
 or there weren't many other options.

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:13.120
 So they took over from horse and carts really.

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:14.840
 So the first trams were horse drawn, of course.

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:17.680
 The first horse car was 1807,

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:19.360
 the Swansea and Mumbles Railway.

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:21.200
 - So those are, just to be clear on what a tram is,

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:24.320
 it's on tracks, but it shares space with the road

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:25.160
 at some points. - Yes, yes.

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:26.200
 - Whereas the train is on tracks,

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.600
 but it has its own complete space.

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.600
 - Yeah, exactly, yeah, yeah.

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:31.880
 So the Swansea and Mumbles Railway

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:33.640
 actually was commissioned in 1804

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.120
 and just carried goods and freight,

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:37.760
 and lots of kids used to hitch rides on it

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:39.520
 to get from Swansea to Mumbles.

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:40.880
 And so they thought, well, maybe we should make

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.000
 this a passenger thing.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.440
 And so that became the first passenger one.

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:47.240
 And then there were still no other trams for about 50 years.

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:49.040
 - And then George Train came along.

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:52.120
 - George Train blinded in. - Brilliantly named George Train.

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:56.000
 He went into trams, and he made one in Birkenhead,

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.880
 and he invited all the crown heads of Europe

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:01.040
 to the ground opening and none of them came.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:02.640
 (all laughing)

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:03.640
 - Oh, really? - Wow.

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:05.440
 - It's Birkenhead, it's quite hard to get to.

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:06.760
 - Oh, okay, fair enough.

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:08.360
 - But we've invited all the crown heads of Europe

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:09.280
 to our Christmas show,

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:11.720
 which is coming up in a few days at the time of recording.

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:12.680
 I think they will be there.

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:13.880
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:15.080
 - And he founded the football team,

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:16.800
 didn't he, Train Merovers?

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:20.440
 - Brilliant, a Birkenhead joke, amazing.

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:21.280
 - What was it?

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:22.760
 - That's where Tranmiera from, Birkenhead.

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.160
 - I've got to be honest. - Okay.

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:25.280
 - I did not intend that.

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:28.240
 - That is an extraordinary coincidence.

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:29.080
 Well done.

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:31.200
 - Because it was such a shockingly bad joke

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:33.240
 that I thought there must have been something extra there.

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:34.400
 - So did I. - Wow.

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:35.240
 - And there was.

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:37.600
 - So James did all the work to make that work, that's great.

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:38.920
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:41.880
 - And then he started one in London, George Train.

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:44.000
 I went from Marble Arch to Bayswater,

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.040
 and it was very popular.

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:45.880
 Lots of people used it,

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:48.400
 apart from anyone who lived nearby,

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:50.520
 because there were lots of really, really posh houses

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:52.880
 around there, and anyone who lived there

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:55.480
 had to cross over the line to get to Hyde Park.

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:57.040
 They were just walking across,

00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:59.000
 now they had to get past the tram line,

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000
 and people would just smash it up.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.200
 - The tram lines were raised, weren't they?

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.440
 And it was a complete pain in the bum to walk around,

00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:06.160
 to walk over and all of this, yeah, yeah.

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:10.760
 In 1952, all the final trams left London,

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:12.680
 and the tracks were torn up and all of this.

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:14.120
 And this is a cool thing.

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:16.480
 The final journey of the trams went from Woolwich to New Cross,

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:19.240
 and it took three extra hours to normal,

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:21.760
 because of the crowds cheering it along the way.

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:25.160
 And the driver of the final tram, this is so nice.

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:26.240
 There's a guy called John Cliff,

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:28.320
 who was the deputy chairman of London Transport,

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:31.360
 and he had started his career as a tram driver

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:35.920
 52 years before, and he got to drive the final one,

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:38.400
 which is just like that, you know that Fraser thing?

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:41.240
 So in the first episode,

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:44.360
 someone brings in Martin's horrible chair,

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:46.280
 and when Fraser's dad is moving in,

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:49.280
 and then in the final ever episode, 11 years later,

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:52.000
 someone, a removal man, comes in to take the chair away,

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.400
 and it's the same removal man.

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:55.520
 And that's the best example you could think of

00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:57.320
 of someone going through their whole career doing that.

00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:58.640
 Well, it's the most relatable one, isn't it?

00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:02.840
 We all know it, it's going to be understood.

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:06.440
 Judge Train was later declared a lunatic and arrested

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:09.440
 for reading the scripture in support of Victoria Woodhull,

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:11.440
 the suffragette.

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:14.640
 When trams went electric, so that was a huge step.

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:15.840
 They were horse drawn for ages.

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:18.480
 Was it accepted, or was it like Dylan going electric?

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:21.400
 No, people prefer the acoustic trams for a long time.

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:23.520
 (laughing)

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:26.240
 They, yeah, they went electric in Britain

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:29.960
 in the sort of 1880s and 1890s.

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:33.200
 And so now we tend to have trams with the cables above,

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:36.560
 but they used to be under the ground.

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:38.200
 That was a bit of an issue because then the rails

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.880
 would be electrified, so if you stepped on them,

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:41.000
 that was a problem.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.640
 So they had this cool system called contact studs,

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:47.720
 which is where basically along the tram rail,

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:50.800
 you'd have these big metal studs

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:53.920
 and they were connected to an electricity supply underground,

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:56.520
 but they would be switched off and they would be triggered

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:58.440
 to switch on when the tram ran over them

00:32:58.440 --> 00:32:59.760
 by a magnet on the tram.

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:00.600
 Brilliant.

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:01.560
 It sounds brilliant.

00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:04.720
 They're really unreliable and they often stayed live.

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:07.400
 So what you had to do with the contact studs

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:12.800
 was employ street urchins often to go and stand on the rails

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:15.720
 and say, look, we think this is not live anymore,

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:17.880
 but could you just step on that rail?

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:19.080
 Are you joking?

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:19.920
 No.

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:21.240
 This is a complicated electrical job.

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:23.240
 We need an urchin to do it.

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.880
 No, no, because they were just testing it.

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:27.120
 They were literally there to see if they got electrified.

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:28.880
 And how badly would they be electrified?

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:29.520
 Pretty bad.

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:31.720
 Like horses would sometimes leap up

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:33.640
 and then drop down stone dead.

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:35.320
 I think they use a horse.

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:36.480
 Yeah, they should have used a horse.

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:37.240
 They're all out of work.

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:37.760
 Terrific.

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:38.920
 Yeah, it's pretty bad.

00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:42.120
 Let's say I grew up near Manchester and they have trams there

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:45.360
 and I was always worried that they might be electrified

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:49.120
 and didn't want to stand on the tracks the next they were.

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:50.600
 I'd see so many urchins go up.

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:55.000
 Can I tell you one cool thing about tram design?

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.120
 I don't need to guess why it exists.

00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:00.960
 So they would have spiral, old trams would have spiral staircases.

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:02.080
 So you get up to the top level.

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:03.120
 I've been on one.

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:04.880
 Yep, and you've got a driver.

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:05.560
 That's my clue.

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:06.440
 Picture the driver.

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:09.600
 Is the driver on the top like an old horse and cart

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:10.040
 where you'd have a--

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:11.040
 No, bottom.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.280
 He's at the bottom.

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:18.400
 And there was one step on the spiral that's full of little holes.

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:19.960
 Why do you think it's full of little holes?

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:22.800
 Did he have shoes which he could click in like a Lego,

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:24.840
 a piece of Lego into there?

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:27.480
 And then he's stuck fast and he wouldn't fall over

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:28.800
 when it went round the corner.

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.960
 But if he's driving, is that for the conductor, for example?

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:32.560
 I was thinking conductor's mode.

00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:34.520
 It's related to the conductor.

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:37.320
 But it's about if the conductor is a pervert.

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:39.920
 Oh, uh, oh, what?

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:41.080
 You were so excited.

00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:42.200
 I didn't know, but I just thought of--

00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:44.440
 A spiral staircase looking at women's skirts.

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:45.400
 You're bang on.

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:45.900
 Oh.

00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:50.840
 So this was-- well, you're sort of there,

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:52.440
 if I'd ask you a follow-up question.

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:54.600
 Basically, the holes are there because the driver needs

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:56.640
 to be able to see over his left shoulder

00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:59.640
 and the stairs block his view unless you put holes in.

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:02.440
 So there were holes in one step so he could look over his left

00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:03.080
 shoulder.

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:06.640
 But they always came with a screen that you could pull down.

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:08.880
 And that was because if the tram's going the other way

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:11.280
 and the conductor's at the stairs end,

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:14.440
 he can look through the holes at ladies' ankles.

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:15.640
 Ankles, oh no.

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:20.160
 Ankles, even worse than up the skirts in those days.

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:23.040
 I wonder if-- you know, if you're an urchin.

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:27.200
 And they wanted you to kind of stand on this electrical thing.

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.720
 Do you think they tricked you by saying,

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:30.280
 do you want to be a conductor?

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:34.840
 And you said, well, just stand on these--

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:39.520
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:41.920
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show.

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:43.360
 And that is James.

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:45.520
 OK, my fact this week is that because nobody

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:47.400
 can decide where it was invented,

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:51.400
 there's currently a split in the banana splits world.

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:53.040
 Brilliant.

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:55.320
 Some people say Croatia, don't they?

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:57.300
 Yes.

00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:03.360
 There was also the banana Zagreb and the Brovnik.

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:05.280
 So yeah, two places in America, basically.

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:06.600
 In fact, we might come on to it.

00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:08.760
 There was also a third pretender.

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:11.760
 But mainly two places in America,

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:16.400
 a place called Wilmington, Ohio, and La Trobe, Pennsylvania.

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:19.560
 And Wilmington say that it was invented by a guy

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:22.200
 called E.R. Hazard, who supposedly came up

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:24.600
 with banana splits, which is basically you take a banana,

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:27.360
 you split it in half, you put ice cream in the middle of it.

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:32.400
 He supposedly invented it to attract students to his shop.

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:35.200
 But they reckon that he did it in something

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.280
 like 1907 or 1908.

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:39.120
 And yet, there is a lot of evidence

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:40.520
 that they existed before that.

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:44.240
 So no one's having to go at Wilmington or anything.

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:46.960
 But it seems very unlikely that they are the real ones.

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:47.800
 You're taking the side here.

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:48.920
 You think it was the other one?

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:51.160
 I actually think that possibly it was neither.

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:53.320
 But certainly on these two, I think

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:57.160
 La Trobe, Pennsylvania definitely has the better claim

00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:59.240
 because they have evidence that there

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:01.800
 was a guy called David Strickler, sometimes William

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:02.560
 Strickler.

00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:04.880
 Different newspaper articles have different names.

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:09.400
 But he definitely was making them around 1904, 1905.

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:12.800
 We have evidence that he was buying these banana-shaped glass

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:13.560
 things.

00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:15.960
 I wonder if we know stuff because Strickler is really

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:16.800
 celebrated there.

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:17.160
 Oh, yeah.

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:19.000
 Why do we not know his first name?

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.120
 I think we probably do.

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:21.800
 And I think one person made a mistake.

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:24.160
 And then that mistake has kind of gone through because--

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:26.720
 But yeah, if you look, in fact, even like newspaper

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:28.520
 articles relatively close to the time,

00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:30.640
 some of them call him William and some of them call him David,

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:31.320
 it's so weird.

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:36.040
 So are they split over what his first name is?

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:38.520
 Yeah, so I read that basically he'd

00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:40.280
 made a special boat-shaped dish.

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:42.040
 He commissioned these glass-shaped dishes.

00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:44.600
 But that no one has actually got a receipt

00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:45.760
 that that hasn't turned up.

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.760
 But maybe I'm sure there are contemporary reports.

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:49.560
 I know for a fact that they were being

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:52.360
 sold close by in 1905.

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:53.120
 Oh, OK.

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:57.440
 So I found some newspaper adverts, one in Harrisburg,

00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:00.480
 Pennsylvania, which is fairly close to Littrow,

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:01.920
 was about 100 miles away.

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:04.760
 They were selling them in 1906, which was a year before they

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:07.520
 were supposedly invented in Wilmington.

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:11.120
 There was a-- yeah, some from 1904, 1905, 1906.

00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:13.480
 You can see they start popping up in newspapers

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:14.400
 as being advertised.

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:15.360
 Is it not possible?

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:18.200
 You know, with all great scientific discoveries,

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:20.720
 or a lot of them, society as a whole

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:22.360
 has progressed to a certain place,

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:25.160
 where it's inevitable that individuals come up

00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:27.040
 with things simultaneously, you know?

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:28.760
 And they'll be on the other side of the world.

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:29.960
 And is it possible that--

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:31.040
 This is morphic resonance.

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:33.440
 This is all cheap rolling across cattle grids

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:34.240
 around the planet.

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:36.560
 So like the Dennis the Menace thing of when they were

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:37.560
 individually invented into--

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:38.560
 It's not like that at all.

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:40.440
 This is the same banana pudding that we're talking about.

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:41.440
 It is kind of the same.

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:43.400
 So the Dennis the Menace thing, there

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:46.600
 had recently been a song called Dennis the Menace.

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.640
 It was like a music whole song.

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:50.720
 And kind of people came up with these characters,

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:52.640
 probably influenced by that.

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:54.920
 In America, in the late 19th century,

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:57.800
 they started importing bananas from different countries,

00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:58.920
 and they started selling them.

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:00.080
 So that was really big.

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:02.560
 They'd also started making ice cream more regularly,

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:05.040
 because they had much better ways of making ice cream.

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.480
 So ice cream was new.

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:07.880
 Bananas was new.

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:10.680
 It was the time for banana splits to be invented.

00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:15.000
 It's not rocket science, just merging them together.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.600
 Apology accepted, Izzy.

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:20.000
 Well, I don't think I've ever had a banana split.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:20.480
 Have you not?

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:21.880
 No, I've never had one.

00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:22.880
 No.

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:23.680
 You're not missing out.

00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:24.480
 I'd never choose one.

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:25.960
 It's one of the least good puddings.

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:28.120
 Yeah, but as a child, you must have been given them,

00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:30.760
 because it's a way to make you eat bananas.

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:33.400
 I read that in the UK they're known as the banana longboat,

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:34.320
 which I like as well.

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:34.720
 But apparently--

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:35.520
 I've never heard that.

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:36.120
 Me neither.

00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:40.640
 I think it was only in Wimpy, in the restaurant chain Wimpy.

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:42.600
 There was one other thing that I mentioned earlier.

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:45.320
 The Soda Fountain magazine reckoned

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:48.280
 that the banana split was invented in Boston.

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:50.920
 There was an ice cream convention in 1905,

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:52.680
 and there was a guy called Stinson Thomas,

00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:54.800
 who supposedly invented it.

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:59.720
 But Boston has since ceded its title to this place

00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:01.760
 in Pennsylvania.

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.680
 Very noble of Boston.

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:07.320
 There was even a claim I read that it was invented by someone

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:11.080
 called Letty Lally in 1904.

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:13.560
 I read this is a claim that she'd invented the banana split,

00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:15.600
 and people were claiming this back in the '50s.

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.320
 But historians have since concluded--

00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:19.520
 so don't panic at Wilmington and Trobe--

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:22.520
 that she actually invented the banana Royale, which

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:25.280
 I was not familiar with, but it's like a crap banana split

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:26.920
 where you chop the banana the wrong way.

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:29.040
 You chop the banana across the waist

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:32.560
 rather than dissecting it top to bottom.

00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:35.320
 But multiple times, like waist, neck, knees.

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:37.280
 And do you put ice cream in it still?

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:38.360
 Yeah, yeah, and you put ice cream.

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:40.880
 Otherwise, it's just a chopped banana.

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:42.040
 It seems pointless, right?

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.880
 Yeah, just seems mad.

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:45.960
 I tell you what, we love inventing words.

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:48.080
 I know, but you're not going to be in a restaurant going,

00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:49.200
 I see banana split on the menu.

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:51.200
 Do you do banana Royale?

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:52.320
 I'm sorry, the chef can't do it.

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:53.800
 We don't have the crockery for it.

00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:55.080
 I'm so sorry.

00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:57.920
 Reminds me of one.

00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:00.240
 So that could be the case if your bananas

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:01.920
 come ready split, couldn't it?

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:03.120
 Do you know what I mean?

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:04.640
 So I used to work in a restaurant,

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:07.960
 and we used to have scrambled eggs that came in a carton.

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:10.400
 And so we would make scrambled eggs in the morning,

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.640
 because you didn't have to scramble them yourself.

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:14.000
 They came ready scrambled.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.640
 But then people would come in and say,

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:16.920
 can I have a bile egg instead?

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:18.920
 And you'd have to say, we don't have any eggs.

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:22.280
 And they're like, well, what's this in front of you?

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:23.920
 That's so funny.

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:25.240
 Here's another variant of it.

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:26.960
 Have you heard of the human banana split?

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:28.120
 Oh, disgusting.

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:29.360
 You cut a human in half.

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:31.000
 That's correct.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.440
 Oh, I know what you're doing here.

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:33.000
 What?

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.680
 Is it the fact that we share 60% of our DNA with bananas?

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:39.280
 No, you've made a huge reach from the fact

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:41.200
 that I make huge reaches all the time.

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:43.480
 But that makes us a literal banana split, doesn't it?

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:44.760
 No, it doesn't.

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:45.880
 Doesn't that?

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:49.480
 Not unless you were to clone a human and a banana together.

00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:52.240
 That was the original draft of Jeff Goldblum's The Fly.

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:55.320
 A banana gets thrown into the machine at the last minute,

00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:57.360
 and he comes out in a banana costume.

00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:00.600
 No, this is-- it's a practice more than a dessert.

00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:02.680
 It's where some people throw bananas at you,

00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:05.000
 and then other people pour whipped cream and chocolate over you.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:05.840
 And it's kind of a--

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:06.840
 Is it a sex thing?

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:07.840
 No, not at all.

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:08.400
 Not at all.

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:10.720
 It's more of a prank than a--

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:12.440
 I've only found evidence of it happening twice.

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:15.680
 It feels like an only fans kind of thing, doesn't it?

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:19.800
 I'm sure it will be within half an hour of the show going out.

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:24.800
 We'll have hundreds of thousands of people watching.

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:27.560
 Once it happened to some guy who was raising money for charity,

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:30.040
 they sort of said, I'll send the videos of your human banana

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:32.240
 split being made, and another time it was Gordon Ramsay

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:33.880
 having to-- having to him.

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:36.400
 It's not-- so it's not like a franchise yet, is it?

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:38.720
 It hasn't become a universally known--

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:40.400
 It's not as popular as the banana split.

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:43.680
 No, no, I don't think it will be.

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:45.520
 So this-- I think the reason they came about

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:49.680
 was really because of the popularity of soda fountains.

00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:51.880
 Right, which is such an American thing

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:52.960
 that we don't really have.

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:55.440
 And they were basically there because people

00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:58.280
 would go to the drug store, and they wanted to cure

00:42:58.280 --> 00:42:59.560
 stuff that they had.

00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:03.000
 And people believed at the time that carbonated water--

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.000
 That's got to go.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.480
 Yeah, I'm just slipping in and out.

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:07.960
 I'm slipping in and out.

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:10.800
 And these from Guatemala, and it's from Boston.

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:13.520
 I've got some Bostonian blood.

00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:16.080
 People would go to the pharmacy, and they

00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:19.040
 had these fountains, which would give them fizzy water, which

00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:21.160
 people thought was very curative at the time.

00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:23.400
 Like Coca-Cola was a curative thing, wasn't it?

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:26.440
 Yeah, yeah, so they'd mix it up by giving them flavors,

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:28.040
 and the Coca-Cola and stuff.

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:31.160
 And then they'd start adding stuff to these

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:32.360
 to make them more appealing.

00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:34.800
 And that's where the Sundays came about,

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:36.560
 and that's where the banana split came about.

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:38.400
 And that's why Strickler was a pharmacist,

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:40.280
 because he worked in a pharmacy.

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:43.600
 And he thought, how do I get more people to my soda fountains?

00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:44.800
 He was a jerk, wasn't he?

00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:45.840
 He was a jerk.

00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:46.840
 Yeah, a soda jerk.

00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:48.600
 That's what they called them, soda jerks.

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:49.080
 Yeah.

00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:52.080
 Apparently, it was a pun on the word "clurk."

00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:54.080
 Clark, clerk.

00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:58.400
 So someone who works in a pharmacy might be a clerk.

00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:03.520
 And then your guy, who was jerking down the handle

00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:06.080
 to make the ice cream, he would be jerking that down,

00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:07.600
 so he would be a soda jerk.

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:09.800
 Yeah, I really-- I didn't know anything

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:11.360
 about soda fountains and soda jerks.

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:13.560
 We've seen them in a couple of films and things like this.

00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:15.560
 But there are so many--

00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:18.360
 yeah, Pepsi and Coca-Cola were the next stage,

00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:20.040
 where you got pre-made syrup.

00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:22.280
 Because before that, everyone had their own recipes,

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:25.840
 and individual soda jerks would have their own things.

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:29.040
 Cocaine was legal in these until about 1914.

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:31.560
 Yeah, often you just drop some cocaine in with your soda.

00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:32.760
 A small amount, obviously.

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:34.600
 It's like cocktails, weren't they, really?

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:35.240
 Yeah.

00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:36.160
 Bit like that.

00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:39.400
 And that was a kind of golden age of crazy different recipes

00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:43.840
 before the more uniform, really popular big drinks came in.

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:44.800
 But OK, I've got a few--

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:47.440
 It's like the Cambrian explosion of ice cream.

00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:48.400
 Yeah.

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:51.160
 Yeah, on a slightly smaller time frame.

00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:53.160
 That's the thing which happened in the Tree of Life, isn't it?

00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:55.080
 I'm only vaguely aware of the Cambrian explosion.

00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:57.720
 I just know a lot of animals came with lots of weird arms

00:44:57.720 --> 00:44:59.000
 coming off their heads and stuff.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.120
 It was exactly like that.

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:01.720
 OK, I wanted to tell you a few of the--

00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:03.600
 What animals have arms coming off their heads?

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:04.920
 Unsuccessful ones.

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:06.840
 OK, OK, the ones that died out.

00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:11.120
 Well, do you want to hear a few that have died out of the ice creams?

00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:14.200
 These are ice creams and ice creamy drinks.

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:17.800
 So the black cow was--

00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:19.000
 Milk.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:19.720
 Ice cream.

00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:20.800
 I'll give you that.

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:21.760
 Guinness.

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:23.280
 Chocolate syrup and root beer.

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:24.080
 Pretty close.

00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:24.680
 Yeah.

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:26.000
 That sounds good.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.600
 Twist it, choke it, and make it cackle.

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:32.440
 Well, I'd rather do it after the show.

00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:35.400
 Twist it, choke it, and make it cackle.

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:39.200
 You had to kill your own chicken, and then they'd put that in.

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:43.720
 Well, you had to put an egg in it, so kind of close.

00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:46.040
 OK, but they were also, for the winter, they were hot sodas.

00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:47.840
 Because obviously, selling cold, icy sodas

00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:49.200
 is very unpopular in the wintertime.

00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:50.440
 So they invented a load of hot drinks

00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:51.760
 to go with these machines.

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:54.120
 So there was hot eggnog, hot mint juleps,

00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:56.520
 and if you guys get any of the ingredients of this,

00:45:56.520 --> 00:46:01.760
 I'll give you a big smile and base.

00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:03.800
 You almost went for 1,000 points.

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:06.720
 But it's like, oh, I can't give them 1,000 imaginary points.

00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:07.720
 That would be terrible.

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:08.200
 Oh, points?

00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:09.880
 I thought pounds, I was hearing pounds.

00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:11.200
 I wavered between points of pounds

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:13.520
 and thought I don't want to give either away.

00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:16.160
 The reeking smash.

00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:16.840
 Reeking smash.

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:17.560
 What are the ingredients for?

00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:18.480
 Spinach.

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:20.000
 No.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.280
 Reek, so, kimchi.

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:24.560
 Oh, classic.

00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:27.960
 1950s American soda joking.

00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:29.800
 Korean import export.

00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:31.560
 OK, the reeking smash.

00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:33.720
 This sounds like the worst drink I could possibly imagine.

00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:35.880
 Water, some kind of water.

00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:38.480
 I'm not going to give you that, actually.

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:41.480
 Clam juice, cream and ginger.

00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:42.560
 Clam juice, cream and ginger.

00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:45.480
 So close with cinnamon.

00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:47.400
 It just sounds absolutely frank.

00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:49.640
 Yeah, that's not a good combination.

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:52.080
 So, it's so weird to think why Coca-Cola took off

00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:54.200
 in an environment where you could get a nice reeking smash.

00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:57.400
 Imagine if we were all drinking reeking smash now.

00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:00.280
 Just very quickly, I was looking into other kinds

00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:01.840
 of banana splits.

00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:04.520
 And one that I'd not actually ever heard of

00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:07.680
 was a Hannah Barbera cartoon.

00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:09.640
 The banana splits, you haven't heard of.

00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:12.560
 Yeah, it kind of like passed me by.

00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:15.360
 And it didn't last too long.

00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:17.200
 It was 1968 to 1970.

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:19.200
 There was a syndication that went on a bit later.

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:22.320
 Can I just say also, I wasn't alive in those years.

00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:24.280
 They did repeat it quite a bit.

00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:26.960
 Yeah, it was syndicated from '70 to '82,

00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:29.120
 but obviously it's been on TV ever since.

00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:30.680
 And who knows in this country when.

00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:32.200
 But it was cancelled.

00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:36.400
 So, they made a movie in 2019, the banana splits movie.

00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:39.600
 And it's amazing because this was a kids TV show.

00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:42.840
 The plotline of this movie is that the banana splits

00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:45.840
 are in studio and they're recording their show

00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:47.960
 where they discovered they were about to be cancelled.

00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:50.000
 The movie is about the murder spree

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.920
 that the banana splits go on,

00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:54.160
 killing everyone inside the studio

00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:56.320
 because they're furious about the upcoming cancellation.

00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:57.880
 Are they actually banana splits?

00:47:57.880 --> 00:47:59.440
 'Cause I don't know how they would murder anyone.

00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:02.680
 They were like huge sort of bear, were they bears?

00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:04.640
 Yeah, they were like big animals.

00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:06.080
 Big animals, exactly.

00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:07.000
 You played in a band.

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.600
 It sounds like Alpha Papa.

00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:11.840
 Yeah, it does sound like that, which is an amazingly good film.

00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:13.000
 It is, as I've seen that.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.920
 But yeah, it was rated R, I believe.

00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:17.120
 And this is, so a lot of people were furious

00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:19.240
 because their childhood classic had come back

00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:21.240
 and they couldn't take their kids to it.

00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:22.240
 Turn it to scream.

00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:23.840
 Yeah, exactly.

00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:27.160
 You know when Bob Barley was accused of plagiarizing that?

00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:28.000
 That TV show?

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.720
 Yeah, he was accused of plagiarizing it for Buffalo Soldier.

00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:35.640
 And it's the bit that in the theme tune that says

00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:40.720
 Tralalala, Tralalala, Tralalala.

00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:42.200
 Oh my days.

00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:43.200
 That's the banana splits.

00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:44.360
 I don't know anything about.

00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:45.520
 Who do you say, Bob Dylan?

00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:46.680
 Bob Barley.

00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:48.320
 I don't know any Bob Barley songs.

00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:52.080
 Buffalo Soldier, well, obviously it's exactly the same tune.

00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:53.640
 I mean, it's a very simple tune

00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:55.600
 and it's almost certainly didn't plagiarize it

00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:58.320
 and he has been, well, people who represent him

00:48:58.320 --> 00:48:59.480
 have been asked about it.

00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:01.640
 I mean, that sounded bang on, I gotta say.

00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:04.320
 I'm on the side of the banana splits on this one.

00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:08.960
 Well, a friend of Bob said he was a very serious man

00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:11.680
 and I doubt very much he had come across something like

00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:12.680
 a banana splits.

00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:14.520
 Well, a friend of Snorky from the banana splits said

00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:17.360
 that bastard stole our song.

00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:19.280
 I've got one final thing about Soda Fountains

00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:21.840
 and who killed the Soda Fountain, right?

00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:24.400
 So this is from a piece in the New York Times

00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:26.280
 talking about why this declined, you know,

00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:27.120
 because they were huge.

00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:28.600
 They were where people socialized,

00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:29.440
 they were where people hung out,

00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:31.240
 they were big business as well.

00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:32.400
 So there's a theory.

00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:34.840
 It was whoever invented the driving restaurant,

00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:37.440
 which then was the next huge thing.

00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:38.280
 There's a theory.

00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:42.600
 It was F.D. Roosevelt who repealed prohibition.

00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:43.520
 There's another theory.

00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:45.520
 And this is all from the New York Times piece about it.

00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:47.000
 There's a guy called William Painter.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:51.600
 Okay, William Painter was the person who patented

00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:54.200
 the crimped metal bottle cap.

00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:56.760
 - Oh, because I thought Willie Painter was the guy

00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:59.040
 who invented the camouflage gun.

00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:01.280
 (laughing)

00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:05.080
 (laughing)

00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:05.920
 Very good.

00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:08.760
 - As you would say.

00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:09.960
 - What's the word, sorry, what is that?

00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:11.240
 - You know the crimped metal bottle cap,

00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:12.360
 like on a glass bottle of Coke.

00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:13.400
 That bottle cap is metal,

00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:14.920
 but it's also got this kind of, you know,

00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:16.520
 like ruffles around the edge of the crimps.

00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:19.000
 So that made it possible to standardize drinks.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:19.840
 And he actually invented that

00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:21.480
 in around the like the early,

00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:22.480
 the first decade of the 20th century.

00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:25.520
 - And it meant that you could buy a thousand of them

00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:26.520
 and keep them in a warehouse.

00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:27.360
 - Exactly.

00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:28.840
 - Each time someone making a new one.

00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:29.680
 - Exactly, yeah.

00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:30.520
 - Interesting.

00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:32.480
 - The reason I mentioned this guy, William Painter,

00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:33.600
 is because I thought I'd try and find out

00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:35.520
 other stuff about his life and work.

00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:36.840
 He invented a load of different things,

00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:39.440
 including, and I can find no more details about this,

00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:41.440
 an ejector seat for trains.

00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:43.200
 (laughing)

00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:44.040
 - Brilliant.

00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:47.880
 - And it doesn't say whether it's for the driver

00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:49.160
 or for the passengers.

00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:51.120
 - Must be the driver.

00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:53.560
 - Every single passenger had,

00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:56.440
 you see them flying into the air, 300 people.

00:50:56.440 --> 00:50:59.600
 One last thing.

00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:00.840
 - Do you know that Liz Truss's mum

00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:03.320
 used to regularly dress up as a banana?

00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:04.880
 (laughing)

00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:05.720
 - No.

00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:07.680
 - Sorry, Amanda's a hoot, Liz Truss is.

00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:09.000
 - Yes, sorry.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.800
 For any international or British listeners,

00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:14.000
 Liz Truss was the person who was momentarily

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:17.160
 prime minister of the country a very short while ago.

00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:19.120
 - And she's the second most successful member

00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:21.640
 of her family by the sound of the chains.

00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:22.980
 - Wow.

00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:24.760
 - This actually came out in a book

00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:25.680
 that was famously released,

00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:28.360
 a book that's called Out of the Blue.

00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:29.880
 Well, it was called Out of the Blue,

00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:31.200
 the inside story of Liz Truss

00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:32.680
 and her explosive rise to power.

00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:35.880
 And it had to be re-titled that book Out of the Blue,

00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:37.640
 the inside story of the unexpected rise

00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:39.280
 and rapid fall of Liz Truss.

00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:44.560
 But yeah, her mum was a big campaigner for various things.

00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:46.560
 So she moved to Eastern Europe in the 1970s

00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:49.080
 to try out life under communism, for instance.

00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:49.920
 Yeah.

00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:52.800
 And she wanted to promote fair trade in leads

00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:54.560
 in the 1970s and she did this

00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:57.440
 by making herself a bright yellow banana costume.

00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:59.560
 And wandering around in it.

00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:00.400
 - Wow.

00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:02.520
 - And Liz Truss would say she'd go into the supermarket

00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:04.000
 and the kids would be like,

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:04.840
 - She's that amazing.

00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:06.160
 - So her mum just put on her again.

00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:07.000
 - Why did Liz Truss not bring this up?

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.320
 - If she brought that up, yeah, I would be more.

00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:10.080
 - 'Cause she kept saying she was from leads,

00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:12.380
 she couldn't stop saying she went to school in leads.

00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:14.200
 I think I'd be saying my mum used to dress as a man.

00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:15.040
 - Do you think you would?

00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:17.120
 I think that's really on the cusp of is it gonna work

00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:18.360
 or is it gonna ruin me?

00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:22.400
 - I suppose the Tory voters are not gonna love the idea

00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:25.640
 that she was going to live on the communist government

00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:26.920
 in Eastern Europe.

00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:28.360
 - You could leave out that part.

00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:29.860
 - Or entrusted in fair trade.

00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:34.040
 - Liz Truss, she admired Margaret Thatcher, didn't she?

00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:36.480
 Thatcher used to work in ice cream.

00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:38.680
 So if her mum got together with Thatcher,

00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:39.720
 we could have had a banana split.

00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:40.640
 - A human banana split?

00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:41.980
 - Yes.

00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:42.820
 - Oh my God.

00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:45.400
 (upbeat music)

00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:49.440
 - Okay, that's it, that is all of our facts.

00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:50.800
