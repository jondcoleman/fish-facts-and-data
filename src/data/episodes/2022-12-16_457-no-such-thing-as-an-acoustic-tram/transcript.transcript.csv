00:00:01,00:00:03,"- Hi everybody, just before we start this week's show,"
00:00:03,00:00:05,we know that Christmas is on the way
00:00:05,00:00:07,and if you are hoping to do any Christmas shopping
00:00:07,00:00:09,"for the fish fan in your life,"
00:00:09,00:00:11,then we have some last minute recommendations
00:00:11,00:00:15,that will save your bacon and save Christmas.
00:00:15,00:00:17,"- Yes, my first bacon saving recommendation"
00:00:17,00:00:20,is that you buy two books immediately
00:00:20,00:00:22,by the sanctuary by some random
00:00:22,00:00:24,called Andrew Hunter Murray.
00:00:24,00:00:26,"- Yes, me. - That's this guy."
00:00:26,00:00:29,"Look, it goes against all my principles"
00:00:29,00:00:31,"to say this, I don't even necessarily like the guy,"
00:00:31,00:00:33,but it really is a brilliant book.
00:00:33,00:00:34,It's got amazing reviews.
00:00:34,00:00:37,"It's gripping, it's about this remote island"
00:00:37,00:00:39,owned by a mysterious billionaire.
00:00:39,00:00:41,"It's very twisty, turny, thriller."
00:00:41,00:00:43,"It's fantastic and once you've done that,"
00:00:43,00:00:46,go and buy The Theory of Everything Else
00:00:46,00:00:50,"by a certain Dan Schreiber, very different kind of book."
00:00:50,00:00:52,"It's like getting inside Dan Schreiber's head,"
00:00:52,00:00:53,but in a really fun way.
00:00:53,00:00:55,It's not as chaotic as you'd imagine.
00:00:55,00:00:58,It's full of the amazing theories
00:00:58,00:00:59,that geniuses have come up with
00:00:59,00:01:01,that you definitely won't have heard of.
00:01:01,00:01:05,It's a fascinating fact in every paragraph basically.
00:01:05,00:01:06,So get those.
00:01:06,00:01:07,"- Absolutely, and alternatively,"
00:01:07,00:01:09,you can get Christmas goodies
00:01:09,00:01:11,from no such thing as a fish.com.
00:01:11,00:01:14,We have just launched two new t-shirts
00:01:14,00:01:16,along with lovely pin badges.
00:01:16,00:01:19,You can identify other fish listeners in the wild
00:01:19,00:01:22,slash public by getting yourself one of these two things.
00:01:22,00:01:24,There's also a lovely tour book
00:01:24,00:01:25,from the recent tour we've just finished
00:01:25,00:01:28,which is a complete history and demonology
00:01:28,00:01:31,and future guide to fish and all its iterations.
00:01:31,00:01:32,They're all so much fun
00:01:32,00:01:35,and you can get them at nosuchthingasafish.com.
00:01:35,00:01:36,"- Yep, that's right."
00:01:36,00:01:38,And now we will see this vlogging presence to you
00:01:38,00:01:41,and say on with the show.
00:01:41,00:01:42,- On with the podcast.
00:01:42,00:01:44,(upbeat music)
00:01:44,00:01:47,(upbeat music)
00:01:47,00:02:01,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:02:01,00:02:04,"of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast"
00:02:04,00:02:07,coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:02:07,00:02:08,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:02:08,00:02:10,"I'm sitting here with James Harkin,"
00:02:10,00:02:12,Anna Tyshinski and Andrew Hunter Murray.
00:02:12,00:02:13,"And once again,"
00:02:13,00:02:15,we have gathered around the microphones
00:02:15,00:02:18,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:02:18,00:02:21,"and in a particular order, here we go."
00:02:21,00:02:24,Starting with fact number one and that is Anna.
00:02:24,00:02:27,- My fact this week is that many of the Muppets
00:02:27,00:02:31,were designed and created by someone called Kermit Love
00:02:31,00:02:34,who had absolutely nothing to do with Kermit the Frog.
00:02:34,00:02:38,"- When you say had nothing to do with Kermit the Frog,"
00:02:38,00:02:39,that's literal.
00:02:39,00:02:40,"It's not figuratively,"
00:02:40,00:02:42,I will have nothing to do with Kermit the Frog.
00:02:42,00:02:43,- Had huge beef from the start.
00:02:43,00:02:45,"Yeah, yeah, big falling out."
00:02:45,00:02:47,"- I think huge beef was Mr. Snuffle Upchut, you see."
00:02:47,00:02:49,(laughing)
00:02:49,00:02:52,"- No, he just, he wasn't involved in the making of him."
00:02:52,00:02:55,So Kermit Love was a designer and builder of Muppets.
00:02:55,00:02:59,He was most famous probably for doing Big Bird.
00:02:59,00:03:01,Was his big hit.
00:03:01,00:03:03,"But, you know, lots of the other ones."
00:03:03,00:03:04,"Snuffle Upchut, I think."
00:03:04,00:03:06,"Oscar the Grouch, the Cookie Monster."
00:03:06,00:03:09,But Kermit was created about 10 years
00:03:09,00:03:12,before he even thought about joining the Muppets.
00:03:12,00:03:14,"And they're just both called Kermit,"
00:03:14,00:03:16,which I think must have been a more common name.
00:03:16,00:03:17,"- It was, Mark. - And it was."
00:03:17,00:03:18,"- Yeah, definitely."
00:03:18,00:03:19,- 'Cause there was one of the presidents
00:03:19,00:03:20,"had a son called Kermit, didn't he?"
00:03:20,00:03:22,"- Yeah, Kermit Rose."
00:03:22,00:03:23,"- Three years old, I think, so."
00:03:23,00:03:25,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:03:25,00:03:27,- I don't think he designed Big Bird.
00:03:27,00:03:29,I think he helped to create the design.
00:03:29,00:03:31,"So there was a sort of drawing and he was,"
00:03:31,00:03:32,they couldn't make it work.
00:03:32,00:03:34,And there are just so many design flaws in it.
00:03:34,00:03:35,So they needed Kermit to come in.
00:03:35,00:03:36,- Co-designed.
00:03:36,00:03:37,- Co-designed.
00:03:37,00:03:38,"- Oh, what do you think?"
00:03:38,00:03:40,"- It was manufactured, I guess, isn't it?"
00:03:40,00:03:43,"- Basically, Jim Henson would draw what he wanted, I guess."
00:03:43,00:03:45,"And then he'd give it to people like Kermit Love,"
00:03:45,00:03:47,"who was the main person on Big Bird,"
00:03:47,00:03:48,"and say, ""Can you make this?"""
00:03:48,00:03:50,"And then he'd try and make it as close as possible,"
00:03:50,00:03:50,I suppose.
00:03:50,00:03:52,- One thing about Kermit Love was that he had
00:03:52,00:03:55,all this amazing experience of puppets
00:03:55,00:03:58,"and costumes before he joined the Muppet Show, obviously."
00:03:58,00:03:59,So one of the things he'd worked on
00:03:59,00:04:02,was spangling the girls at the Paris Lido.
00:04:02,00:04:03,"So, ballet."
00:04:03,00:04:04,"- That's a euphemism, isn't it?"
00:04:04,00:04:06,(laughing)
00:04:06,00:04:07,Where were you last night?
00:04:07,00:04:09,Were you spangling the girls at the Paris Lido?
00:04:09,00:04:11,(laughing)
00:04:11,00:04:11,- Lido as well.
00:04:11,00:04:13,"It's such a weird word in English, but."
00:04:13,00:04:14,- What about the Lido?
00:04:14,00:04:15,- It's quite a common word.
00:04:15,00:04:17,"- Yeah, Lido's a very common word."
00:04:17,00:04:18,- I don't think that it was an open-air swimming pool.
00:04:18,00:04:19,"- No, that was the confusion."
00:04:19,00:04:20,(laughing)
00:04:20,00:04:22,"- So, all--"
00:04:22,00:04:23,- So he's not spangling girls who are paying
00:04:23,00:04:24,five pounds for a swim?
00:04:24,00:04:25,"- No, no, no, exactly."
00:04:25,00:04:27,"No, he was working with ballet dancers a lot of the time."
00:04:27,00:04:29,"So he worked for the New York City Ballet,"
00:04:29,00:04:31,and he specialised there on turning humans
00:04:31,00:04:32,into half puppets.
00:04:32,00:04:33,"- Oh, did he?"
00:04:33,00:04:34,- That was a big part of his--
00:04:34,00:04:36,"- And of course, that's what Big Bird is, right?"
00:04:36,00:04:37,"- Right, yeah."
00:04:37,00:04:38,"- It's half human, half puppet,"
00:04:38,00:04:39,unlike the other Muppets
00:04:39,00:04:42,"that are kind of actual, classic puppets."
00:04:42,00:04:42,- Exactly.
00:04:42,00:04:44,"Well, Big What 'cause there's a human inside, do you mean?"
00:04:44,00:04:44,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:04:44,00:04:45,"- Wow. - Yeah, sorry."
00:04:45,00:04:46,(laughing)
00:04:46,00:04:47,"- No, you're right, sorry."
00:04:47,00:04:49,"- I think when the character dies one day, Big Bird,"
00:04:49,00:04:50,"they should do a live autopsy,"
00:04:50,00:04:51,and all the Muppets freak out
00:04:51,00:04:53,when they find a human inside.
00:04:53,00:04:55,(laughing)
00:04:55,00:04:58,- The design that Henson sent
00:04:58,00:04:59,apparently didn't have feathers.
00:04:59,00:05:01,Kermit Love added those.
00:05:01,00:05:02,"But that's weird, isn't it?"
00:05:02,00:05:03,To have a bird without any feathers.
00:05:03,00:05:05,"- Yeah, don't try to think of any actual birds"
00:05:05,00:05:06,without feathers.
00:05:06,00:05:06,- I don't think there are any.
00:05:06,00:05:09,"- A pterodactyl, I suppose, is the early, you know."
00:05:09,00:05:11,- A pterodactyl isn't a bird.
00:05:11,00:05:13,"Dinosaurs are birds, and yet pterodactyls aren't."
00:05:13,00:05:14,- That's a weird thing.
00:05:14,00:05:15,"- I guess think of Cookie Monster, right?"
00:05:15,00:05:16,"Like, I know he's not feathered,"
00:05:16,00:05:18,"but the material could look,"
00:05:18,00:05:19,I could imagine a Big Bird
00:05:19,00:05:21,"with that kind of felt material, or whatever it is."
00:05:21,00:05:22,"- What I wondered is,"
00:05:22,00:05:24,the one birds that don't have feathers
00:05:24,00:05:27,"is really, really young, pre-fledgedlings,"
00:05:27,00:05:29,"like little chicks, right?"
00:05:29,00:05:31,"So maybe he's a really baby, that Big Bird,"
00:05:31,00:05:34,and he will grow up into something even bigger.
00:05:34,00:05:35,"- Yeah, that's good."
00:05:35,00:05:36,- Does he seem quite immature?
00:05:36,00:05:37,'Cause I've never actually seen--
00:05:37,00:05:38,"- He's actually six years old, isn't he?"
00:05:38,00:05:40,"- Six years old, I love that."
00:05:40,00:05:42,But there's an amazing detail that Kermit Love
00:05:42,00:05:45,"went overseas to China for a filming,"
00:05:45,00:05:47,"and they took Big Bird and Big Bird,"
00:05:47,00:05:49,"like the costume, 'cause they were doing that,"
00:05:49,00:05:51,"but Big Bird was given a seat on the plane,"
00:05:51,00:05:53,"and because he's six years old,"
00:05:53,00:05:56,the Chinese airline charged him half price.
00:05:56,00:05:57,"- Fair enough, yeah."
00:05:57,00:05:58,"- Well, no, what's fascinating about that is,"
00:05:58,00:06:00,I can't believe that you used to get
00:06:00,00:06:01,"half price tickets for children,"
00:06:01,00:06:03,because I don't pay so much money.
00:06:03,00:06:06,Any time one of my million kids turns two years old.
00:06:06,00:06:10,- Why don't you put the child in a Big Bird costume?
00:06:10,00:06:13,"- Fly them to China and make it a big publicity thing,"
00:06:13,00:06:14,which is why they actually did this.
00:06:14,00:06:16,"- Exactly, yeah, you need more publicity,"
00:06:16,00:06:18,that's what we're doing.
00:06:18,00:06:22,Big Bird is in a way the opposite of Tinky Winky.
00:06:22,00:06:23,"- Oh, yeah."
00:06:23,00:06:25,"- Okay, can you work out why?"
00:06:25,00:06:28,"- Well, Tinky Winky, giant purple deli-tubby,"
00:06:28,00:06:31,"famously gay, carries a handbag."
00:06:31,00:06:32,- TV on his stomach.
00:06:32,00:06:33,- Thank you.
00:06:33,00:06:34,- TV on his stomach.
00:06:34,00:06:35,"- You did all the legwork, James,"
00:06:35,00:06:38,"and Anna just came in, came in at the end."
00:06:38,00:06:40,"- I think I know deli-tubby's too well,"
00:06:40,00:06:42,"because they all have TVs on their stomachs,"
00:06:42,00:06:44,and I was going about what differentiates him
00:06:44,00:06:45,from the other TV's.
00:06:45,00:06:46,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm really sorry."
00:06:46,00:06:48,"I should have said the opposite of a deli-tubby,"
00:06:48,00:06:50,"but it's the, where Tinky Winky has a TV"
00:06:50,00:06:51,"on the outside of his stomach,"
00:06:51,00:06:53,Big Bird has a TV on the inside of his stomach.
00:06:53,00:06:54,- Really?
00:06:54,00:06:55,- For the puppeteer to see what he's doing.
00:06:55,00:06:56,- Wow.
00:06:56,00:06:57,"- Oh, that makes sense."
00:06:57,00:06:59,"- He just needs, basically, and it's below,"
00:06:59,00:07:00,"it's a small TV monitor,"
00:07:00,00:07:03,and he just has to look down at what is going on
00:07:03,00:07:05,on the monitor to see what's going on outside.
00:07:05,00:07:06,"- 'Cause I read that as well,"
00:07:06,00:07:08,but what I read didn't go into any more details.
00:07:08,00:07:10,"It said so he could see the set,"
00:07:10,00:07:12,"and I couldn't work out whether the TV would be,"
00:07:12,00:07:14,"give you a projection from Big Bird's eyes,"
00:07:14,00:07:16,"in which case, have to have cameras in his eyes."
00:07:16,00:07:17,- Yeah.
00:07:17,00:07:19,"- Or you're seeing the actual set,"
00:07:19,00:07:22,"as in you're seeing yourself from, like, the third person."
00:07:22,00:07:23,- Good call.
00:07:23,00:07:24,"- And that must be difficult, right?"
00:07:24,00:07:25,- Yeah.
00:07:25,00:07:27,- To know where to walk if you're seeing yourself on TV.
00:07:27,00:07:30,"- Yeah, you'd have to invert left and right, wouldn't you?"
00:07:30,00:07:32,"- Yeah, that's probably the least of your problems."
00:07:32,00:07:33,"I don't know, really."
00:07:33,00:07:36,- It's like being a ghost when you leave your own body
00:07:36,00:07:38,"after you die, and then you look back at it."
00:07:38,00:07:39,"- Oh, yes."
00:07:39,00:07:41,"- It's not like you have to control your body then,"
00:07:41,00:07:42,so you don't have the difficulty.
00:07:42,00:07:44,"- That's why ghosts always walk through walls,"
00:07:44,00:07:45,"'cause they don't know which way they're going,"
00:07:45,00:07:48,"and they're like, ""Oh, shit, I just walked through a wall."""
00:07:48,00:07:50,- Just very quickly back to Kermit Love.
00:07:50,00:07:52,So one of the innovations that he brought
00:07:52,00:07:56,to the design of Big Bird was malting.
00:07:56,00:07:59,"So he allowed for the feathers to drop off Big Bird,"
00:07:59,00:08:01,"so it looked like, I don't know,"
00:08:01,00:08:03,"like they were real feathers that could fall off,"
00:08:03,00:08:05,"which was really, really nice."
00:08:05,00:08:05,- Absolutely look real.
00:08:05,00:08:07,"- And he used 6,000 dyed feathers"
00:08:07,00:08:10,"from a domestic white turkey, not a single one,"
00:08:10,00:08:13,in order to make the suit.
00:08:13,00:08:15,"- Oh, the suit's made of actual turkey feathers."
00:08:15,00:08:17,"- I think in the initial period,"
00:08:17,00:08:18,it's probably very different now.
00:08:18,00:08:22,"- Kermit Love, he usually spoke with a fake English accent,"
00:08:22,00:08:24,sometimes with a fake French accent.
00:08:24,00:08:27,- I do the fake English accent thing.
00:08:27,00:08:29,"I'm like, ""Yeah, you're actually, where are you from?"""
00:08:29,00:08:30,- I'm from Guatemala.
00:08:30,00:08:32,(laughing)
00:08:32,00:08:33,"- And how do they speak, normally?"
00:08:33,00:08:35,"- I can't, well, I'm not going to give up the accent now."
00:08:35,00:08:37,- You can't break character.
00:08:37,00:08:40,(laughing)
00:08:40,00:08:43,"- He made Big Bird with a guy called Christopher Lyle,"
00:08:43,00:08:46,who he was in a relationship with for over 50 years.
00:08:46,00:08:49,"So I think from before he,"
00:08:49,00:08:50,"they started making Big Bird together, right?"
00:08:50,00:08:52,Until Kermit died in 2008.
00:08:52,00:08:55,"- Yeah, Christopher Lyle was in the pilot for the Muppet Show."
00:08:55,00:08:58,"- Yeah, so like right at the very, very start."
00:08:58,00:08:59,"- I looked at his IMDb because I thought,"
00:08:59,00:09:01,"""Oh, what a cool guy, he seems like Christopher Lyle."""
00:09:01,00:09:03,"And it led me to a fact that I didn't know,"
00:09:03,00:09:05,which is there were two pilots for the Muppet Show.
00:09:05,00:09:08,"So one, very kid-friendly."
00:09:08,00:09:10,"The second pilot was called the Muppet Show,"
00:09:10,00:09:11,Sex and Violence.
00:09:11,00:09:12,(laughing)
00:09:12,00:09:14,I was the second ever Muppet Pilot.
00:09:14,00:09:16,- And did you see what it was about?
00:09:16,00:09:19,"- I couldn't find too much information on it, actually."
00:09:19,00:09:20,"- Well, it was a parody of the fact"
00:09:20,00:09:23,that there was starting to get lots of sex and violence
00:09:23,00:09:25,"on television, so people were complaining."
00:09:25,00:09:27,And so they were parodying lots of different things
00:09:27,00:09:28,that were happening on TV at the time.
00:09:28,00:09:29,"- Okay, right."
00:09:29,00:09:30,"- So it's not fully, it's not-"
00:09:30,00:09:31,"- It wasn't, there wasn't, yeah."
00:09:31,00:09:32,- Still on an sexy title.
00:09:32,00:09:34,- Still sounds like it's not for six-year-olds.
00:09:34,00:09:37,- Big Bird wasn't banging Mr. Snumpluffers.
00:09:37,00:09:38,"- Yeah, exactly, that's what I'd expect."
00:09:38,00:09:41,"- I thought it was just like, yeah."
00:09:41,00:09:44,The other thing is how physically injurious it is
00:09:44,00:09:46,"to be a Muppeteer, one of the men."
00:09:46,00:09:48,"Yeah, yeah, and this is partly because of something."
00:09:48,00:09:51,"Oh, oh, I've got another quiz link."
00:09:51,00:09:54,- Why did you just interrupt yourself then?
00:09:54,00:09:55,- It's gonna be very hard to edit around that.
00:09:55,00:09:56,- You're absolutely right.
00:09:56,00:09:57,- What's the quiz link?
00:09:57,00:09:59,"- What you need to know, so what we-"
00:09:59,00:10:02,- I feel like we missed a lot of steps in your head.
00:10:02,00:10:04,- And you need to calm down.
00:10:04,00:10:05,"- No, I'm so excited to be talking about Muppets."
00:10:05,00:10:06,I love the Muppets so much.
00:10:06,00:10:07,- Do you?
00:10:07,00:10:10,- There's one link between Muppets
00:10:10,00:10:12,"and something that we covered recently,"
00:10:12,00:10:14,"which is Disneyland, when Jamie was on,"
00:10:14,00:10:15,"we mentioned Disneyland, right?"
00:10:15,00:10:17,And there's a link between Disneyland
00:10:17,00:10:18,and the world of the Muppets.
00:10:18,00:10:19,"- And the world of the Muppets, okay."
00:10:19,00:10:20,- I prefer that you don't mention shows
00:10:20,00:10:21,when I wasn't there.
00:10:21,00:10:23,"- Oh, is it something about the acknowledgement"
00:10:23,00:10:25,of characters in real life?
00:10:25,00:10:26,You have to talk to them as if they're real?
00:10:26,00:10:27,"- No, that's not it."
00:10:27,00:10:29,"- I think you said, you started off that sentence"
00:10:29,00:10:30,"before you had the stroke,"
00:10:30,00:10:32,and you were talking about the puppeteers.
00:10:32,00:10:33,- Yes.
00:10:33,00:10:34,- So it's something to do with the puppeteers.
00:10:34,00:10:34,"- Something to do with the puppeteers, yeah."
00:10:34,00:10:35,"- Oh, okay."
00:10:35,00:10:37,"Oh, they have a secret tunnels."
00:10:37,00:10:38,- I'm gonna say that's it.
00:10:38,00:10:42,Muppet filming land is actually on the first floor.
00:10:42,00:10:44,It's about eight feet above the ground
00:10:44,00:10:45,so that the Muppeteers can stand upright.
00:10:45,00:10:48,"But the problem is, some of the Muppeteers are quite short,"
00:10:48,00:10:50,so then they need to wear platform shoes
00:10:50,00:10:52,to get them up to the level that they've been also up to.
00:10:52,00:10:54,And this brings me back to the point
00:10:54,00:10:56,about Muppeteers also being physically injured.
00:10:56,00:10:58,"So the guy who plays Gonzo the Great,"
00:10:58,00:10:59,he's still going actually.
00:10:59,00:11:01,He's had to have four shoulder operations
00:11:01,00:11:04,just due to holding up your hand all the time
00:11:04,00:11:06,and doing a hip replacement.
00:11:06,00:11:08,"And, you know, you're crimped."
00:11:08,00:11:11,- The sacrifice people make is heroic.
00:11:11,00:11:13,"Guys, when you're operating a Muppet mouth,"
00:11:13,00:11:15,imagine you're doing that with your arm up it.
00:11:15,00:11:16,Show me what you do.
00:11:16,00:11:19,"I know you can't see this at home,"
00:11:19,00:11:20,but you've all got it wrong.
00:11:20,00:11:21,- You're choking.
00:11:21,00:11:22,"- Whatever you are doing at home,"
00:11:22,00:11:24,we reckon that's probably wrong as well.
00:11:24,00:11:26,- I think it's unlikely you've got it right.
00:11:26,00:11:27,"- I'm doing a mouth with my hand, we all are."
00:11:27,00:11:31,"- But the key is, is that how mouth move, guys?"
00:11:31,00:11:33,What bit of your mouth do you move when you're talking?
00:11:33,00:11:34,- Your lips.
00:11:34,00:11:36,- Which lip?
00:11:36,00:11:37,- Is it the bottom?
00:11:37,00:11:39,- Is it you're moving your jaw?
00:11:39,00:11:41,- So you say you move only the bottom?
00:11:41,00:11:43,- You move only your thumb.
00:11:43,00:11:44,"This is what one of the operators said,"
00:11:44,00:11:45,"I was watching an interview with him,"
00:11:45,00:11:47,"he said, you've got to keep your top of your hand still"
00:11:47,00:11:48,and you move only your thumb.
00:11:48,00:11:49,- That shit could have sweared.
00:11:49,00:11:51,"Hello, I'm a buyer."
00:11:51,00:11:52,"- Yeah, that does not work."
00:11:52,00:11:53,- It's Pac-Man.
00:11:53,00:11:55,"That's how Pac-Man moves, right?"
00:11:55,00:11:57,"- Does Pac-Man have, yes, he uses the two."
00:11:57,00:11:57,"- Because Pac-Man's going,"
00:11:57,00:11:59,(mimics Pac-Man)
00:11:59,00:12:00,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:12:00,00:12:00,"- We've got an aerial view,"
00:12:00,00:12:01,most likely of Pac-Man's eyes.
00:12:01,00:12:03,"- Well, why is he sideways?"
00:12:03,00:12:04,"- Yeah, it doesn't make any sense."
00:12:04,00:12:05,- We're about to play this thing wider.
00:12:05,00:12:06,- Is he grinding along the floor?
00:12:06,00:12:08,"- If we've got an aerial view,"
00:12:08,00:12:09,"he's just on the floor sideways, isn't he?"
00:12:09,00:12:11,"- Yeah, but he's a disembodied head, right?"
00:12:11,00:12:12,"Like, he's not human."
00:12:12,00:12:14,- So why sideways? We shouldn't be able to see anything
00:12:14,00:12:15,of his mouth movement from above.
00:12:15,00:12:15,- He should just be a circle.
00:12:15,00:12:16,- Yeah.
00:12:16,00:12:18,"- No, unless he's from a species with a side with his mouth."
00:12:18,00:12:19,What are you talking about?
00:12:19,00:12:21,"- Oh, you think he has a mouth on the side of his head?"
00:12:21,00:12:23,"- Possibly, he's an alien."
00:12:23,00:12:24,- He's an alien?
00:12:24,00:12:24,- He's not an alien.
00:12:24,00:12:26,"- Well, he's not a human."
00:12:26,00:12:27,- A man implies human.
00:12:27,00:12:29,"- Wait, no, sorry."
00:12:29,00:12:33,"In later illustrations, he has legs, shoes, arms and gloves."
00:12:33,00:12:34,"So, yeah."
00:12:34,00:12:36,"- Like the M&M's, like the Cartoon M&M's."
00:12:36,00:12:37,- Just like that.
00:12:37,00:12:39,- Also wearing gloves.
00:12:39,00:12:41,- Same universe?
00:12:41,00:12:41,- Clearly they're related.
00:12:41,00:12:43,- Am I thinking of the yellow M&M?
00:12:43,00:12:45,"- Oh, bloody hell, Dan."
00:12:45,00:12:46,"- You are, aren't you?"
00:12:46,00:12:47,- It might be.
00:12:47,00:12:48,"- No, I'm pretty sure Pac-Man has legs."
00:12:48,00:12:49,"- They do cartoons, as well, of Pac-Man."
00:12:49,00:12:50,- Yeah.
00:12:50,00:12:51,- In the '90s.
00:12:51,00:12:52,- I didn't know that.
00:12:52,00:12:53,"- Is it because, do they have to have the gloves?"
00:12:53,00:12:56,Because it's weird seeing his hands.
00:12:56,00:12:58,"Like, the gloves are kind of effectively, it's sort of..."
00:12:58,00:13:00,"- Well, the same as Mickey Mouse, right?"
00:13:00,00:13:00,- Yeah.
00:13:00,00:13:01,- Why do you have gloves?
00:13:01,00:13:02,- Why are all these...
00:13:02,00:13:03,- He's always at a prime scene.
00:13:03,00:13:05,(all laughing)
00:13:05,00:13:06,- He's a snooker referee in his spare time.
00:13:06,00:13:08,Mickey Mouse is the lead.
00:13:08,00:13:10,"- Oh, boy! What a shot!"
00:13:11,00:13:13,- That's not what referees do.
00:13:13,00:13:16,(all laughing)
00:13:16,00:13:17,- That's why I just...
00:13:17,00:13:18,They're not hype men.
00:13:18,00:13:19,"Come on, you man!"
00:13:19,00:13:22,(upbeat music)
00:13:22,00:13:29,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy."
00:13:29,00:13:31,- My fact is that the German army has just had to tear out
00:13:31,00:13:34,some of the size labels from their new uniforms
00:13:34,00:13:38,"because they read small, short, or SS."
00:13:38,00:13:38,- Ooh.
00:13:38,00:13:39,- Yeah.
00:13:39,00:13:40,- Oh.
00:13:40,00:13:41,- Oversight.
00:13:41,00:13:42,(all laughing)
00:13:42,00:13:45,"- A lot of small, short people in the German army."
00:13:45,00:13:47,"- Well, not that many, but one is too many"
00:13:47,00:13:50,to have the SS label in their clothes.
00:13:50,00:13:50,- I agree.
00:13:50,00:13:53,"- So, yeah, most of them were small, medium, large,"
00:13:53,00:13:54,"and extra large, and that's fine."
00:13:54,00:13:56,"But the SS stands for the Schuttstaffel,"
00:13:56,00:13:58,who are the Nazi paramilitary organization
00:13:58,00:13:59,who largely ran the Holocaust.
00:13:59,00:14:02,And it is literally illegal to display their symbols
00:14:02,00:14:03,in Germany.
00:14:03,00:14:06,So the German defense ministry had ordered the soldiers
00:14:06,00:14:08,to tear out the SS lettering.
00:14:08,00:14:09,"I mean, they weren't on display either."
00:14:09,00:14:11,It was literally just a size label in some--
00:14:11,00:14:12,"- Unless you're wearing it inside out,"
00:14:12,00:14:14,"which often, if you get up in the dark,"
00:14:14,00:14:16,"put your clothes on, that's suddenly on display."
00:14:16,00:14:17,"- I think that's an offence on the parade ground, though,"
00:14:17,00:14:19,to have your uniform inside out.
00:14:19,00:14:20,"I don't know much about military discipline,"
00:14:20,00:14:21,but I imagine--
00:14:21,00:14:23,"- I imagine they say, get down and give me 10"
00:14:23,00:14:24,if you do that.
00:14:24,00:14:25,"Yeah, pretty sure."
00:14:25,00:14:28,"- They said if you cut it out, that's one thing."
00:14:28,00:14:30,"But if it's got important information on it,"
00:14:30,00:14:32,"what you should do is cut around the SS,"
00:14:32,00:14:33,so just lose the actual--
00:14:33,00:14:34,- They didn't say that.
00:14:34,00:14:34,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:14:34,00:14:37,- So it's still the shape of an S and an S.
00:14:37,00:14:39,(all laughing)
00:14:39,00:14:41,- Not important information is going to be on an S.
00:14:41,00:14:42,- The washing instructions.
00:14:42,00:14:43,"- The washing, yeah."
00:14:43,00:14:44,"- You know, what if you accidentally put it in at 60?"
00:14:44,00:14:47,- No one's ever read those on any item of clothing.
00:14:47,00:14:49,"- Oh, excuse me, I'm not strong this way."
00:14:49,00:14:50,(all laughing)
00:14:50,00:14:52,It's my regular reading.
00:14:52,00:14:54,Regular reading.
00:14:54,00:14:55,You're getting a shirt.
00:14:55,00:14:57,"Oh, I can't wait to read this."
00:14:57,00:15:00,"- Can I ask, what is the German for small shorts?"
00:15:00,00:15:02,Presumably it's SS in German.
00:15:02,00:15:05,"- Well, that would be KK, which is Clyde, Clyde."
00:15:05,00:15:06,- So how come--
00:15:06,00:15:07,- Is it English?
00:15:07,00:15:08,- I think the supplier would have been
00:15:08,00:15:11,English language and that's why it was a problem.
00:15:11,00:15:12,"- KK is still, what isn't it?"
00:15:12,00:15:15,"'Cause you do feel, you sense that lingering third K."
00:15:15,00:15:17,"- If you're a really, really small soldier"
00:15:17,00:15:18,(all laughing)
00:15:18,00:15:20,"and you're a KKK, that is a problem."
00:15:20,00:15:21,- I didn't realize that though
00:15:21,00:15:23,about the SS being a combination of words
00:15:23,00:15:25,that is banned in certain places.
00:15:25,00:15:27,Like one of the things which was in the article
00:15:27,00:15:30,that you sent around Andy was that SS on number plates
00:15:30,00:15:32,is not allowed in most spots in Germany.
00:15:32,00:15:33,- Is that right?
00:15:33,00:15:36,"- Yes, you can't have SS, you can't have KZ"
00:15:36,00:15:38,because that references concentration camps.
00:15:38,00:15:41,"You can't have HJ because that's the Hitler youth,"
00:15:41,00:15:41,you can't have--
00:15:41,00:15:42,- I'm sorry.
00:15:42,00:15:43,"- Yeah, because there are German words."
00:15:43,00:15:45,"Yeah, it doesn't sound like it makes sense,"
00:15:45,00:15:46,but--
00:15:46,00:15:48,- HJ is also a rude thing.
00:15:48,00:15:50,- I like hand jobby sinking.
00:15:50,00:15:50,- Oh!
00:15:50,00:15:52,- What's handjob in German though?
00:15:52,00:15:54,- Actually testing my GCSE German now.
00:15:54,00:15:55,(all laughing)
00:15:55,00:15:57,It actually didn't come up either in the--
00:15:57,00:15:58,- Not in the aural.
00:15:58,00:16:01,(all laughing)
00:16:01,00:16:02,- I found some German military uniforms
00:16:02,00:16:04,"which are literally made of cardboard,"
00:16:04,00:16:06,which is an interesting thing.
00:16:06,00:16:07,And it's not in Germany.
00:16:07,00:16:10,"It's in Namibia, which was a German colony"
00:16:10,00:16:13,until after the First World War.
00:16:13,00:16:14,"And there is a group of people living there,"
00:16:14,00:16:15,the Herrero tribe.
00:16:15,00:16:19,"And I think though, like a lot of colonized people"
00:16:19,00:16:20,is treated pretty badly.
00:16:20,00:16:22,"- Genocide, I believe."
00:16:22,00:16:22,- Right.
00:16:22,00:16:24,"- Yeah, all the way, all the way to genocide."
00:16:24,00:16:25,- One of the worst ways to be treated.
00:16:25,00:16:29,"- Yes, well the Herrero people now"
00:16:29,00:16:32,"wear a lot of Edwardian European,"
00:16:32,00:16:35,specifically German clothing for traditional rituals
00:16:35,00:16:37,and for special days and things like that.
00:16:37,00:16:40,"So if you go to a Herrero funeral,"
00:16:40,00:16:42,the women will be wearing Edwardian dresses
00:16:42,00:16:44,that were popular in Germany in 1910.
00:16:44,00:16:47,And the men will be wearing uniforms
00:16:47,00:16:49,that are some of them made of cardboard
00:16:49,00:16:52,because they've been replicated to be exactly like
00:16:52,00:16:53,the fashions of that time.
00:16:53,00:16:55,- And it's really similar to the Bolivian Cholitas
00:16:55,00:16:57,that we talked about a few weeks ago.
00:16:57,00:16:59,And also it was the women who adopted this first
00:16:59,00:17:00,"by some way, I think they adopted"
00:17:00,00:17:02,"the European style of dress,"
00:17:02,00:17:05,"but then much like the Cholitas,"
00:17:05,00:17:08,they made it much more full of bright colors
00:17:08,00:17:09,like the clothes that they wore.
00:17:09,00:17:11,"So yeah, and they've got these beautiful hybrid"
00:17:11,00:17:15,Edwardian dresses with these colorful colors on them.
00:17:15,00:17:16,- That's awesome.
00:17:16,00:17:19,"- You know, Germany gave Namibia $1.35 billion"
00:17:19,00:17:21,"in a couple of years ago, I think it was."
00:17:21,00:17:22,I just thought that was very interesting
00:17:22,00:17:24,when people talk about compensating.
00:17:24,00:17:27,"In compensation, they said this was a genocide"
00:17:27,00:17:29,and his $1.5 billion to develop.
00:17:29,00:17:30,So 1.3 times.
00:17:30,00:17:32,- I wonder what you get in the Herrero embassy
00:17:32,00:17:34,whenever you go there.
00:17:34,00:17:37,(all laughing)
00:17:37,00:17:38,"- Wait, I don't get it."
00:17:38,00:17:41,- So what do you get for a year at an embassy party?
00:17:41,00:17:43,There's someone going around with a tray.
00:17:43,00:17:45,"- I get it, I get it, I get it."
00:17:45,00:17:47,"Yeah, yeah, it's a quality stream."
00:17:47,00:17:49,(all laughing)
00:17:49,00:17:52,- Have we mentioned this about French military uniforms
00:17:52,00:17:55,and Napoleon and the baguette?
00:17:55,00:17:57,"- Yeah, yeah, supposedly the baguette was invented"
00:17:57,00:17:59,so you could hide it in your trousers.
00:17:59,00:18:00,"- Oh, that's right."
00:18:00,00:18:00,"Yeah, we have talked about that."
00:18:00,00:18:01,"- Hopefully, okay."
00:18:01,00:18:02,- Sort of like hidden down the inside.
00:18:02,00:18:04,- But it would just fit in the trouser pockets
00:18:04,00:18:05,of the army uniform.
00:18:05,00:18:06,I just couldn't remember if we'd--
00:18:06,00:18:08,"- Can I just say, well, we're talking about Napoleon"
00:18:08,00:18:10,and we might not keep all this in anyway
00:18:10,00:18:11,'cause we have mentioned it before.
00:18:11,00:18:15,"But this morning, I was reading a book about cannibalism"
00:18:15,00:18:17,and there was a nursery rhyme in it.
00:18:17,00:18:20,And apparently it was a genuine nursery rhyme.
00:18:20,00:18:22,"Baby, baby, naughty baby."
00:18:22,00:18:25,"Hush you, squalling thing, I say."
00:18:25,00:18:26,Peace this moment.
00:18:26,00:18:30,"Peace, or maybe, Bonaparte will pass this way."
00:18:30,00:18:32,"And he'll beat you, beat you, beat you."
00:18:32,00:18:34,And he'll beat you all to pop.
00:18:34,00:18:36,"And he'll eat you, eat you, eat you."
00:18:36,00:18:39,"Every morsel, snap, snap, snap."
00:18:39,00:18:40,- Not sure about this bedtime story
00:18:40,00:18:42,when you're waiting for your daughter.
00:18:42,00:18:45,- And I will be appearing on CBVs tomorrow evening
00:18:45,00:18:46,for the bedtime story.
00:18:46,00:18:49,"- So yeah, they made the uniform"
00:18:49,00:18:51,so you could put a baguette in your pocket
00:18:51,00:18:52,and then you could always do the joke.
00:18:52,00:18:54,Is that a gun in your pocket or is it?
00:18:54,00:18:56,- Or is that a hungry?
00:18:56,00:18:57,"- It's a sandwich, yeah."
00:18:57,00:19:00,- Have you read about how modern military uniforms
00:19:00,00:19:02,in America are progressing at the moment?
00:19:02,00:19:05,"It's, they're turning them basically into computers,"
00:19:05,00:19:08,which means that anything that happens on your outfit
00:19:08,00:19:10,can be reported back to base.
00:19:10,00:19:14,"So if you're shot, your suit will know with a spot"
00:19:14,00:19:15,because it can sense a change.
00:19:15,00:19:17,"- Other computers good enough that they can,"
00:19:17,00:19:18,"if the soldier's been shot,"
00:19:18,00:19:21,"can the computer make the soldier keep running, basically?"
00:19:21,00:19:24,"- Not yet, see that's like a Robocop."
00:19:24,00:19:25,"We haven't got to Robocop yet,"
00:19:25,00:19:30,"but it can tell GPS, it can tell literally the liquid level"
00:19:30,00:19:31,of how much heat you're exerting
00:19:31,00:19:34,and if you're in trouble or whatever.
00:19:34,00:19:35,"It's just got all the information,"
00:19:35,00:19:37,all the data is now being collected.
00:19:37,00:19:39,"- Yeah, yeah, nice."
00:19:39,00:19:41,"- I don't know if they can send it right back overseas, I think."
00:19:41,00:19:44,- I think if you can send it over the internet
00:19:44,00:19:45,"from one place to another,"
00:19:45,00:19:47,it could probably go all the way around the world.
00:19:47,00:19:49,"- That's not on the internet, right James?"
00:19:49,00:19:50,- It's on this guy.
00:19:50,00:19:54,"- If he wants attached to the Pentagon,"
00:19:54,00:19:56,"it's like a massive cable, it's like a dolly."
00:19:56,00:19:57,"- Pull them out, pull them out,"
00:19:57,00:19:59,'cause someone literally pulls them all out.
00:19:59,00:20:01,- I don't know how reassuring it is
00:20:01,00:20:02,"if someone says to you, ""Here's your suit,"""
00:20:02,00:20:03,"and the good thing is,"
00:20:03,00:20:05,"when you get shot multiple times in the chest,"
00:20:05,00:20:06,we'll have a computer back home
00:20:06,00:20:09,that knows exactly where you've been shot.
00:20:09,00:20:10,- 'Cause there's a thing called the golden hour
00:20:10,00:20:12,"after a soldier's been injured,"
00:20:12,00:20:14,"which is the time to really,"
00:20:14,00:20:16,whereas you're most likely to save their life.
00:20:16,00:20:16,"And there's also a thing,"
00:20:16,00:20:18,"I think, called something like the platinum five minutes,"
00:20:18,00:20:20,"which is even more,"
00:20:20,00:20:23,you can do absolutely the most to save their life.
00:20:23,00:20:25,"And then there's the diamond five seconds,"
00:20:25,00:20:27,"where you just put your arm and pull the bullet out,"
00:20:27,00:20:29,"and it's like, nothing happened."
00:20:29,00:20:36,- So why do you think the SAS had so many condoms
00:20:36,00:20:38,in the first Gulf War?
00:20:38,00:20:39,- Okay.
00:20:39,00:20:41,- Is it to do with burns?
00:20:41,00:20:44,Only 'cause we were once told to bring condoms
00:20:44,00:20:45,"to stop burning, but Dan's got it."
00:20:45,00:20:47,"- It's water, it's water, yep."
00:20:47,00:20:48,They took loads of condoms
00:20:48,00:20:50,'cause they can hold about a liter of water each.
00:20:50,00:20:51,"And if you're on the run, it's very useful."
00:20:51,00:20:52,"If you pass a stream,"
00:20:52,00:20:53,quickly fill up your condoms with water.
00:20:53,00:20:55,You've got a liter of water there.
00:20:55,00:20:57,- We'll taste quite spermicide-y.
00:20:57,00:21:00,"- Might be one of the strawberry ones, might get lucky."
00:21:00,00:21:02,(laughing)
00:21:02,00:21:04,"But then, so that kind of led me on to this."
00:21:04,00:21:09,"In 1991, the British army ordered half a million bespoke"
00:21:09,00:21:12,camouflage condoms.
00:21:12,00:21:15,- That's a great idea.
00:21:15,00:21:16,- Can you tell me why?
00:21:16,00:21:17,- Well.
00:21:17,00:21:18,- Sand coloured.
00:21:18,00:21:18,"- Oh, sand coloured."
00:21:18,00:21:20,"- For the Gulf War, that was, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:21:20,00:21:22,- If you forget to do up your flies
00:21:22,00:21:23,"after you've been to the Lou,"
00:21:23,00:21:25,"you're always wearing a camouflage condom,"
00:21:25,00:21:26,so it doesn't matter.
00:21:26,00:21:30,"- You lie down in the sand with only your penis stick out,"
00:21:30,00:21:32,but you don't want anyone to shoot it.
00:21:32,00:21:33,(laughing)
00:21:33,00:21:34,So you have to cover it in a condom.
00:21:34,00:21:36,"- It's the periscope, it's the, yeah, yeah."
00:21:36,00:21:37,- Right.
00:21:37,00:21:39,- It's for the rifles.
00:21:39,00:21:42,"- To cover the rifles, to stop any water getting in."
00:21:42,00:21:44,"- Yeah, and sand did the tip."
00:21:44,00:21:48,It can be seriously debilitating if you're firing a rifle.
00:21:48,00:21:50,"- At the end of World War I, in New York City,"
00:21:50,00:21:55,"they had a tower of 12,000 pickle halbers,"
00:21:55,00:21:59,"which are those kind of helmets with a spike on top,"
00:21:59,00:22:01,"you know, like German helmets."
00:22:01,00:22:03,It was like a victory parade.
00:22:03,00:22:05,They got a massive pyramid of these helmets
00:22:05,00:22:08,"in the middle of New York, and then they sold them off."
00:22:08,00:22:11,"But the idea was, look, we've won the war"
00:22:11,00:22:13,and we've got all these trophies and whatever.
00:22:13,00:22:16,Now the thing is that the Germans
00:22:16,00:22:18,didn't really use these helmets.
00:22:18,00:22:21,"They used them in the 19th century,"
00:22:21,00:22:22,but then they were really phased out
00:22:22,00:22:24,"during the start of the 20th century,"
00:22:24,00:22:27,and they were completely replaced in 1916 by steel helmets
00:22:27,00:22:29,"because they're made of leather,"
00:22:29,00:22:30,the ones with the spike on.
00:22:30,00:22:32,They don't help you really in any way.
00:22:32,00:22:33,- And they're conspicuous as well.
00:22:33,00:22:35,If you're in a trench and just you can see a spike
00:22:35,00:22:36,"moving back and forth, yeah."
00:22:36,00:22:37,"- Yeah, they're no use."
00:22:37,00:22:39,"They were replaced by steel helmets,"
00:22:39,00:22:40,"but they had all these old ones,"
00:22:40,00:22:42,"so they put them in an old warehouse,"
00:22:42,00:22:45,"and then the Americans captured the warehouse,"
00:22:45,00:22:46,"took all the helmets out,"
00:22:46,00:22:48,"and then showed them as these are our spoils of war,"
00:22:48,00:22:50,"as if they'd taken them from the soldiers,"
00:22:50,00:22:52,but they didn't take them from an old thing.
00:22:52,00:22:52,"- Wow, very clever."
00:22:52,00:22:53,- And the reason you had the spike
00:22:53,00:22:55,is because it's from the older days
00:22:55,00:22:57,"you might have a big plume on the side,"
00:22:57,00:22:59,"like a ceremonial helmet,"
00:22:59,00:23:02,and that was kind of the spike would hold the plume.
00:23:02,00:23:03,- I was wondering if it was
00:23:03,00:23:05,the old Ben Franklin lightning rod hat.
00:23:05,00:23:07,(laughing)
00:23:07,00:23:08,- I didn't realize.
00:23:08,00:23:09,Loads of other armies have them.
00:23:09,00:23:10,"- Oh yeah, today they have them."
00:23:10,00:23:14,"- Yeah, so the British household cavalry used to have a spike."
00:23:14,00:23:17,"The US Marine Corps, Russian, Swedish."
00:23:17,00:23:18,"- All for plume purposes, is that the--"
00:23:18,00:23:19,"- I think almost all, yeah."
00:23:19,00:23:23,But the Prussian army had changed theirs in 1844.
00:23:23,00:23:26,They ended in a ball because people kept on
00:23:26,00:23:29,injuring their horses or damaging equipment or whatever.
00:23:29,00:23:31,- They think with the lightning rods
00:23:31,00:23:33,"was you had the spike versus the ball as well, didn't you?"
00:23:33,00:23:34,- Oh yeah.
00:23:34,00:23:36,"And maybe lightning kept happening, exactly."
00:23:36,00:23:37,(laughing)
00:23:37,00:23:38,Yeah.
00:23:38,00:23:41,"- Interesting, yeah, today I think ceremonially only,"
00:23:41,00:23:44,"but you would see them in South America, I think,"
00:23:44,00:23:47,"or the Romanian army, maybe."
00:23:47,00:23:49,"- Oh, back in Guatemala, the Tenerpene,"
00:23:49,00:23:50,you'd see them every day.
00:23:50,00:23:51,(laughing)
00:23:51,00:23:54,"- Have you guys ever seen the Landsknecht mercenaries,"
00:23:54,00:23:56,pictures of drawings of these?
00:23:56,00:23:57,- Not sure.
00:23:57,00:23:59,- These were Germans who fought
00:23:59,00:24:01,between the 1400s and the 1600s.
00:24:01,00:24:04,They made up the majority of the Holy Roman Empire.
00:24:04,00:24:07,They were like the elite fighting force.
00:24:07,00:24:09,"So they were using mostly pikes and crossbows,"
00:24:09,00:24:13,"but they also used these things called zvi henders,"
00:24:13,00:24:15,which were swords that were way taller
00:24:15,00:24:16,than the soldier himself.
00:24:16,00:24:19,"So they looked like they're carrying,"
00:24:19,00:24:21,"I mean, you have to carry them over your shoulder"
00:24:21,00:24:22,and it looks ridiculous.
00:24:22,00:24:23,- That's the point.
00:24:23,00:24:24,It must be way too heavy to wheel.
00:24:24,00:24:25,"- I know, I know."
00:24:25,00:24:29,I think the idea was you could basically get at your enemy
00:24:29,00:24:30,"'cause your sword was longer,"
00:24:30,00:24:32,but I think it wasn't that practical in the end.
00:24:32,00:24:35,"- You could think in the really early days of warfare,"
00:24:35,00:24:37,"when all you had was a sword,"
00:24:37,00:24:39,having a slightly longer sword than your enemy
00:24:39,00:24:40,would be an advantage.
00:24:40,00:24:42,"- Yeah, yeah, and then it's an arms race, yeah."
00:24:42,00:24:44,- Eventually you've got a mile long sword.
00:24:44,00:24:46,- That was what the arms race was.
00:24:46,00:24:46,It's not so sweet.
00:24:46,00:24:47,"Back in the day, the arms race"
00:24:47,00:24:49,was just adding a cent to me through our drinks.
00:24:49,00:24:50,"- To your arm, yeah."
00:24:50,00:24:51,(laughing)
00:24:51,00:24:54,"You breed soldiers with super long arms of actually,"
00:24:54,00:24:58,"you know, Mr. Tickle in his time was a ferocious warrior."
00:24:58,00:25:00,"- He had to donate sperm every month, didn't he,"
00:25:00,00:25:02,for this new legion.
00:25:02,00:25:04,He was very good at donating sperm.
00:25:04,00:25:06,"It was very easy for him, obviously."
00:25:06,00:25:08,- I would think it would be quite awkward
00:25:08,00:25:10,"if you're Mr. Tickle, 'cause it's easy"
00:25:10,00:25:12,"to reach things a long way from you, but your own penis."
00:25:12,00:25:14,"- Yeah, you're saying you're so right."
00:25:14,00:25:15,- I don't think we've got any data
00:25:15,00:25:17,about Mr. Tickle's penis though.
00:25:17,00:25:20,"Was it, you know, is everything that long and tickly?"
00:25:20,00:25:22,(laughing)
00:25:22,00:25:24,(upbeat music)
00:25:24,00:25:28,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:25:28,00:25:29,and that is my fact.
00:25:29,00:25:34,"My fact is that in 2015, the actor Vicky McClure"
00:25:34,00:25:36,was kicked off the Vicky McClure tram
00:25:36,00:25:37,for not having a ticket.
00:25:38,00:25:41,"- So, I think she shouldn't have to have a ticket"
00:25:41,00:25:42,if the tram's named after her.
00:25:42,00:25:44,- Turned out she didn't need to have a tram ticket.
00:25:44,00:25:46,Just the ticket inspector didn't realize that
00:25:46,00:25:48,and kicked her off for their evasion.
00:25:48,00:25:51,"So Nottingham is where this tram is,"
00:25:51,00:25:53,"and it's the Nottingham Express Transit,"
00:25:53,00:25:55,and they have a lot of trams
00:25:55,00:25:58,that have a lot of local hero names on it.
00:25:58,00:25:59,Vicky McClure and--
00:25:59,00:26:00,"- Who is she, sorry?"
00:26:00,00:26:01,"- She's, oh yeah, sorry."
00:26:01,00:26:03,So Vicky McClure is an actor.
00:26:03,00:26:05,You might have seen her in line of duty.
00:26:05,00:26:06,You might have seen her in the replacement.
00:26:06,00:26:07,You might have seen her.
00:26:07,00:26:09,- She's-- - The replacement bus journey?
00:26:09,00:26:11,(laughing)
00:26:11,00:26:16,"- She's a very big British actor, yeah, huge deal."
00:26:16,00:26:19,"And yeah, so in 2015, she was offered this"
00:26:19,00:26:21,for it to be named after her.
00:26:21,00:26:22,"She accepted it, she's very excited."
00:26:22,00:26:24,She brought her mother along to the ceremony.
00:26:24,00:26:27,"She sort of officially unveiled it,"
00:26:27,00:26:29,"got onto the tram for the inaugural ride,"
00:26:29,00:26:31,"and then the conductor said, ""Where's your ticket?"""
00:26:31,00:26:34,"And she said, ""I don't have one on Vicky McClure."""
00:26:34,00:26:36,"And he said, ""Yeah, we're all Vicky McClure, get off."""
00:26:36,00:26:39,- And yeah. - Nottingham has a lot of
00:26:39,00:26:41,trams named after people. - There's a lot of them.
00:26:41,00:26:42,- There's a lot of them.
00:26:42,00:26:44,So I'm gonna say a few names.
00:26:44,00:26:46,"Martin Polyakov, scientist."
00:26:46,00:26:47,- Yes. - Big deal scientist.
00:26:47,00:26:50,"D.H. Lawrence, sex writer."
00:26:50,00:26:55,"Krzysztof Brot, tour villain dean."
00:26:55,00:26:56,"I don't know if that's one tram or two, actually."
00:26:56,00:26:58,"- It's one, yeah. - Shame."
00:26:58,00:27:01,- Who gets the front half and who gets the back half?
00:27:01,00:27:02,"- Trams, trams."
00:27:02,00:27:04,"Okay, did you know that there's an annual"
00:27:04,00:27:07,tram bowling competition every year?
00:27:07,00:27:08,- We sure did.
00:27:08,00:27:09,(laughing)
00:27:09,00:27:11,- But tell us more. - Pretty exciting.
00:27:11,00:27:12,So every year there is the European
00:27:12,00:27:14,"tram driver competition, which is a competition"
00:27:14,00:27:16,which sees tram drivers from all over Europe
00:27:16,00:27:18,gathering together to compete against each other
00:27:18,00:27:20,to find the greatest tram driver of all.
00:27:20,00:27:22,They do things like trams billiards.
00:27:22,00:27:24,They do tram bowling.
00:27:24,00:27:26,"So tram bowling would be, you've got giant pins"
00:27:26,00:27:28,"that are at the end of a little track,"
00:27:28,00:27:30,"and you've got a tram racing down,"
00:27:30,00:27:31,"and two people are holding the ball,"
00:27:31,00:27:33,"and it nudges the ball, and it tries to not."
00:27:33,00:27:34,It's a huge inflatable ball.
00:27:34,00:27:36,It's not your average bowling ball.
00:27:36,00:27:37,- No. - I think what's interesting is
00:27:37,00:27:39,"that's quite obvious what that would be,"
00:27:39,00:27:42,but tram billiards on the other hand.
00:27:42,00:27:43,- Good point. - Which you haven't explained.
00:27:43,00:27:45,"- No, I'm-- - Tram billiards,"
00:27:45,00:27:47,I couldn't tell you what tram billiards is.
00:27:47,00:27:49,Tram billiards doesn't bid that much
00:27:49,00:27:50,"relation to actual billiards,"
00:27:50,00:27:54,but it looks like a really boring spectator sport.
00:27:54,00:27:58,It is where a tram goes very slowly and cautiously
00:27:58,00:28:02,"towards a table, which has got lots of scores written on it,"
00:28:02,00:28:04,and coming out of the table is kind of a channel
00:28:04,00:28:06,"with a little ball at the end,"
00:28:06,00:28:08,and the tram nudges into the channel
00:28:08,00:28:10,"and knocks the ball onto the table,"
00:28:10,00:28:12,and whatever score the ball lands on.
00:28:12,00:28:13,"- Oh, so it's shuffleboard."
00:28:13,00:28:15,"Shuffleboard isn't-- - Yeah, or shove-hateney."
00:28:15,00:28:17,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I like that."
00:28:17,00:28:18,"- But there are more exciting events than that,"
00:28:18,00:28:19,even more exciting.
00:28:19,00:28:22,There's stopping within 20 centimetres of a cone
00:28:22,00:28:23,"without hitting it. - Yeah, pretty cool."
00:28:23,00:28:26,- That's good. (laughing)
00:28:26,00:28:28,- What does that entail? (laughing)
00:28:28,00:28:31,- Accelerate to exactly 30 kilometres an hour
00:28:31,00:28:33,without a speedometer.
00:28:33,00:28:33,That's pretty good.
00:28:33,00:28:36,- How do they remove the speedometer from this?
00:28:36,00:28:38,- I don't know if it's quite a technical thing.
00:28:38,00:28:40,- I think you put some black masking tape
00:28:40,00:28:41,over it or something. - That's not what it says.
00:28:41,00:28:43,It says without the speedometer.
00:28:43,00:28:45,"- Yeah, yeah, they have to commission hundreds"
00:28:45,00:28:48,of new trams every year for this.
00:28:48,00:28:50,- It's the most expensive sport in Europe.
00:28:50,00:28:53,"- Yeah, so trams, when I was reading about this,"
00:28:53,00:28:55,I realized trams were much more revolutionary
00:28:55,00:28:58,"than I had realised, and I think we said that a lot,"
00:28:58,00:28:59,but it is true.
00:28:59,00:29:04,So they were the way that you got around for about 100 years.
00:29:04,00:29:07,- They still are in some places.
00:29:07,00:29:08,"- But there wasn't other options,"
00:29:08,00:29:10,or there weren't many other options.
00:29:10,00:29:13,So they took over from horse and carts really.
00:29:13,00:29:14,"So the first trams were horse drawn, of course."
00:29:14,00:29:17,"The first horse car was 1807,"
00:29:17,00:29:19,the Swansea and Mumbles Railway.
00:29:19,00:29:21,"- So those are, just to be clear on what a tram is,"
00:29:21,00:29:24,"it's on tracks, but it shares space with the road"
00:29:24,00:29:25,"at some points. - Yes, yes."
00:29:25,00:29:26,"- Whereas the train is on tracks,"
00:29:26,00:29:27,but it has its own complete space.
00:29:27,00:29:29,"- Yeah, exactly, yeah, yeah."
00:29:29,00:29:31,So the Swansea and Mumbles Railway
00:29:31,00:29:33,actually was commissioned in 1804
00:29:33,00:29:35,"and just carried goods and freight,"
00:29:35,00:29:37,and lots of kids used to hitch rides on it
00:29:37,00:29:39,to get from Swansea to Mumbles.
00:29:39,00:29:40,"And so they thought, well, maybe we should make"
00:29:40,00:29:42,this a passenger thing.
00:29:42,00:29:44,And so that became the first passenger one.
00:29:44,00:29:47,And then there were still no other trams for about 50 years.
00:29:47,00:29:49,- And then George Train came along.
00:29:49,00:29:52,- George Train blinded in. - Brilliantly named George Train.
00:29:52,00:29:56,"He went into trams, and he made one in Birkenhead,"
00:29:56,00:29:58,and he invited all the crown heads of Europe
00:29:58,00:30:01,to the ground opening and none of them came.
00:30:01,00:30:02,(all laughing)
00:30:02,00:30:03,"- Oh, really? - Wow."
00:30:03,00:30:05,"- It's Birkenhead, it's quite hard to get to."
00:30:05,00:30:06,"- Oh, okay, fair enough."
00:30:06,00:30:08,- But we've invited all the crown heads of Europe
00:30:08,00:30:09,"to our Christmas show,"
00:30:09,00:30:11,which is coming up in a few days at the time of recording.
00:30:11,00:30:12,I think they will be there.
00:30:12,00:30:13,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:30:13,00:30:15,"- And he founded the football team,"
00:30:15,00:30:16,"didn't he, Train Merovers?"
00:30:16,00:30:20,"- Brilliant, a Birkenhead joke, amazing."
00:30:20,00:30:21,- What was it?
00:30:21,00:30:22,"- That's where Tranmiera from, Birkenhead."
00:30:22,00:30:24,- I've got to be honest. - Okay.
00:30:24,00:30:25,- I did not intend that.
00:30:25,00:30:28,- That is an extraordinary coincidence.
00:30:28,00:30:29,Well done.
00:30:29,00:30:31,- Because it was such a shockingly bad joke
00:30:31,00:30:33,that I thought there must have been something extra there.
00:30:33,00:30:34,- So did I. - Wow.
00:30:34,00:30:35,- And there was.
00:30:35,00:30:37,"- So James did all the work to make that work, that's great."
00:30:37,00:30:38,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:30:38,00:30:41,"- And then he started one in London, George Train."
00:30:41,00:30:44,"I went from Marble Arch to Bayswater,"
00:30:44,00:30:45,and it was very popular.
00:30:45,00:30:45,"Lots of people used it,"
00:30:45,00:30:48,"apart from anyone who lived nearby,"
00:30:48,00:30:50,"because there were lots of really, really posh houses"
00:30:50,00:30:52,"around there, and anyone who lived there"
00:30:52,00:30:55,had to cross over the line to get to Hyde Park.
00:30:55,00:30:57,"They were just walking across,"
00:30:57,00:30:59,"now they had to get past the tram line,"
00:30:59,00:31:01,and people would just smash it up.
00:31:01,00:31:02,"- The tram lines were raised, weren't they?"
00:31:02,00:31:04,"And it was a complete pain in the bum to walk around,"
00:31:04,00:31:06,"to walk over and all of this, yeah, yeah."
00:31:06,00:31:10,"In 1952, all the final trams left London,"
00:31:10,00:31:12,and the tracks were torn up and all of this.
00:31:12,00:31:14,And this is a cool thing.
00:31:14,00:31:16,"The final journey of the trams went from Woolwich to New Cross,"
00:31:16,00:31:19,"and it took three extra hours to normal,"
00:31:19,00:31:21,because of the crowds cheering it along the way.
00:31:21,00:31:25,"And the driver of the final tram, this is so nice."
00:31:25,00:31:26,"There's a guy called John Cliff,"
00:31:26,00:31:28,"who was the deputy chairman of London Transport,"
00:31:28,00:31:31,and he had started his career as a tram driver
00:31:31,00:31:35,"52 years before, and he got to drive the final one,"
00:31:35,00:31:38,"which is just like that, you know that Fraser thing?"
00:31:38,00:31:41,"So in the first episode,"
00:31:41,00:31:44,"someone brings in Martin's horrible chair,"
00:31:44,00:31:46,"and when Fraser's dad is moving in,"
00:31:46,00:31:49,"and then in the final ever episode, 11 years later,"
00:31:49,00:31:52,"someone, a removal man, comes in to take the chair away,"
00:31:52,00:31:53,and it's the same removal man.
00:31:53,00:31:55,And that's the best example you could think of
00:31:55,00:31:57,of someone going through their whole career doing that.
00:31:57,00:31:58,"Well, it's the most relatable one, isn't it?"
00:31:58,00:32:02,"We all know it, it's going to be understood."
00:32:02,00:32:06,Judge Train was later declared a lunatic and arrested
00:32:06,00:32:09,"for reading the scripture in support of Victoria Woodhull,"
00:32:09,00:32:11,the suffragette.
00:32:11,00:32:14,"When trams went electric, so that was a huge step."
00:32:14,00:32:15,They were horse drawn for ages.
00:32:15,00:32:18,"Was it accepted, or was it like Dylan going electric?"
00:32:18,00:32:21,"No, people prefer the acoustic trams for a long time."
00:32:21,00:32:23,(laughing)
00:32:23,00:32:26,"They, yeah, they went electric in Britain"
00:32:26,00:32:29,in the sort of 1880s and 1890s.
00:32:29,00:32:33,"And so now we tend to have trams with the cables above,"
00:32:33,00:32:36,but they used to be under the ground.
00:32:36,00:32:38,That was a bit of an issue because then the rails
00:32:38,00:32:39,"would be electrified, so if you stepped on them,"
00:32:39,00:32:41,that was a problem.
00:32:41,00:32:44,"So they had this cool system called contact studs,"
00:32:44,00:32:47,"which is where basically along the tram rail,"
00:32:47,00:32:50,you'd have these big metal studs
00:32:50,00:32:53,"and they were connected to an electricity supply underground,"
00:32:53,00:32:56,but they would be switched off and they would be triggered
00:32:56,00:32:58,to switch on when the tram ran over them
00:32:58,00:32:59,by a magnet on the tram.
00:32:59,00:33:00,Brilliant.
00:33:00,00:33:01,It sounds brilliant.
00:33:01,00:33:04,They're really unreliable and they often stayed live.
00:33:04,00:33:07,So what you had to do with the contact studs
00:33:07,00:33:12,was employ street urchins often to go and stand on the rails
00:33:12,00:33:15,"and say, look, we think this is not live anymore,"
00:33:15,00:33:17,but could you just step on that rail?
00:33:17,00:33:19,Are you joking?
00:33:19,00:33:19,No.
00:33:19,00:33:21,This is a complicated electrical job.
00:33:21,00:33:23,We need an urchin to do it.
00:33:23,00:33:24,"No, no, because they were just testing it."
00:33:24,00:33:27,They were literally there to see if they got electrified.
00:33:27,00:33:28,And how badly would they be electrified?
00:33:28,00:33:29,Pretty bad.
00:33:29,00:33:31,Like horses would sometimes leap up
00:33:31,00:33:33,and then drop down stone dead.
00:33:33,00:33:35,I think they use a horse.
00:33:35,00:33:36,"Yeah, they should have used a horse."
00:33:36,00:33:37,They're all out of work.
00:33:37,00:33:37,Terrific.
00:33:37,00:33:38,"Yeah, it's pretty bad."
00:33:38,00:33:42,Let's say I grew up near Manchester and they have trams there
00:33:42,00:33:45,and I was always worried that they might be electrified
00:33:45,00:33:49,and didn't want to stand on the tracks the next they were.
00:33:49,00:33:50,I'd see so many urchins go up.
00:33:50,00:33:55,Can I tell you one cool thing about tram design?
00:33:55,00:33:57,I don't need to guess why it exists.
00:33:57,00:34:00,"So they would have spiral, old trams would have spiral staircases."
00:34:00,00:34:02,So you get up to the top level.
00:34:02,00:34:03,I've been on one.
00:34:03,00:34:04,"Yep, and you've got a driver."
00:34:04,00:34:05,That's my clue.
00:34:05,00:34:06,Picture the driver.
00:34:06,00:34:09,Is the driver on the top like an old horse and cart
00:34:09,00:34:10,where you'd have a--
00:34:10,00:34:11,"No, bottom."
00:34:11,00:34:12,He's at the bottom.
00:34:12,00:34:18,And there was one step on the spiral that's full of little holes.
00:34:18,00:34:19,Why do you think it's full of little holes?
00:34:19,00:34:22,"Did he have shoes which he could click in like a Lego,"
00:34:22,00:34:24,a piece of Lego into there?
00:34:24,00:34:27,And then he's stuck fast and he wouldn't fall over
00:34:27,00:34:28,when it went round the corner.
00:34:28,00:34:30,"But if he's driving, is that for the conductor, for example?"
00:34:30,00:34:32,I was thinking conductor's mode.
00:34:32,00:34:34,It's related to the conductor.
00:34:34,00:34:37,But it's about if the conductor is a pervert.
00:34:37,00:34:39,"Oh, uh, oh, what?"
00:34:39,00:34:41,You were so excited.
00:34:41,00:34:42,"I didn't know, but I just thought of--"
00:34:42,00:34:44,A spiral staircase looking at women's skirts.
00:34:44,00:34:45,You're bang on.
00:34:45,00:34:45,Oh.
00:34:45,00:34:50,"So this was-- well, you're sort of there,"
00:34:50,00:34:52,if I'd ask you a follow-up question.
00:34:52,00:34:54,"Basically, the holes are there because the driver needs"
00:34:54,00:34:56,to be able to see over his left shoulder
00:34:56,00:34:59,and the stairs block his view unless you put holes in.
00:34:59,00:35:02,So there were holes in one step so he could look over his left
00:35:02,00:35:03,shoulder.
00:35:03,00:35:06,But they always came with a screen that you could pull down.
00:35:06,00:35:08,And that was because if the tram's going the other way
00:35:08,00:35:11,"and the conductor's at the stairs end,"
00:35:11,00:35:14,he can look through the holes at ladies' ankles.
00:35:14,00:35:15,"Ankles, oh no."
00:35:15,00:35:20,"Ankles, even worse than up the skirts in those days."
00:35:20,00:35:23,"I wonder if-- you know, if you're an urchin."
00:35:23,00:35:24,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:35:24,00:35:27,And they wanted you to kind of stand on this electrical thing.
00:35:27,00:35:28,"Do you think they tricked you by saying,"
00:35:28,00:35:30,do you want to be a conductor?
00:35:30,00:35:34,"And you said, well, just stand on these--"
00:35:34,00:35:39,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:35:39,00:35:41,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show."
00:35:41,00:35:43,And that is James.
00:35:43,00:35:45,"OK, my fact this week is that because nobody"
00:35:45,00:35:47,"can decide where it was invented,"
00:35:47,00:35:51,there's currently a split in the banana splits world.
00:35:51,00:35:53,Brilliant.
00:35:53,00:35:55,"Some people say Croatia, don't they?"
00:35:55,00:35:57,Yes.
00:35:57,00:36:03,There was also the banana Zagreb and the Brovnik.
00:36:03,00:36:05,"So yeah, two places in America, basically."
00:36:05,00:36:06,"In fact, we might come on to it."
00:36:06,00:36:08,There was also a third pretender.
00:36:08,00:36:11,"But mainly two places in America,"
00:36:11,00:36:16,"a place called Wilmington, Ohio, and La Trobe, Pennsylvania."
00:36:16,00:36:19,And Wilmington say that it was invented by a guy
00:36:19,00:36:22,"called E.R. Hazard, who supposedly came up"
00:36:22,00:36:24,"with banana splits, which is basically you take a banana,"
00:36:24,00:36:27,"you split it in half, you put ice cream in the middle of it."
00:36:27,00:36:32,He supposedly invented it to attract students to his shop.
00:36:32,00:36:35,But they reckon that he did it in something
00:36:35,00:36:37,like 1907 or 1908.
00:36:37,00:36:39,"And yet, there is a lot of evidence"
00:36:39,00:36:40,that they existed before that.
00:36:40,00:36:44,So no one's having to go at Wilmington or anything.
00:36:44,00:36:46,But it seems very unlikely that they are the real ones.
00:36:46,00:36:47,You're taking the side here.
00:36:47,00:36:48,You think it was the other one?
00:36:48,00:36:51,I actually think that possibly it was neither.
00:36:51,00:36:53,"But certainly on these two, I think"
00:36:53,00:36:57,"La Trobe, Pennsylvania definitely has the better claim"
00:36:57,00:36:59,because they have evidence that there
00:36:59,00:37:01,"was a guy called David Strickler, sometimes William"
00:37:01,00:37:02,Strickler.
00:37:02,00:37:04,Different newspaper articles have different names.
00:37:04,00:37:09,"But he definitely was making them around 1904, 1905."
00:37:09,00:37:12,We have evidence that he was buying these banana-shaped glass
00:37:12,00:37:13,things.
00:37:13,00:37:15,I wonder if we know stuff because Strickler is really
00:37:15,00:37:16,celebrated there.
00:37:16,00:37:17,"Oh, yeah."
00:37:17,00:37:19,Why do we not know his first name?
00:37:19,00:37:20,I think we probably do.
00:37:20,00:37:21,And I think one person made a mistake.
00:37:21,00:37:24,And then that mistake has kind of gone through because--
00:37:24,00:37:26,"But yeah, if you look, in fact, even like newspaper"
00:37:26,00:37:28,"articles relatively close to the time,"
00:37:28,00:37:30,"some of them call him William and some of them call him David,"
00:37:30,00:37:31,it's so weird.
00:37:31,00:37:36,So are they split over what his first name is?
00:37:36,00:37:38,"Yeah, so I read that basically he'd"
00:37:38,00:37:40,made a special boat-shaped dish.
00:37:40,00:37:42,He commissioned these glass-shaped dishes.
00:37:42,00:37:44,But that no one has actually got a receipt
00:37:44,00:37:45,that that hasn't turned up.
00:37:45,00:37:47,But maybe I'm sure there are contemporary reports.
00:37:47,00:37:49,I know for a fact that they were being
00:37:49,00:37:52,sold close by in 1905.
00:37:52,00:37:53,"Oh, OK."
00:37:53,00:37:57,"So I found some newspaper adverts, one in Harrisburg,"
00:37:57,00:38:00,"Pennsylvania, which is fairly close to Littrow,"
00:38:00,00:38:01,was about 100 miles away.
00:38:01,00:38:04,"They were selling them in 1906, which was a year before they"
00:38:04,00:38:07,were supposedly invented in Wilmington.
00:38:07,00:38:11,"There was a-- yeah, some from 1904, 1905, 1906."
00:38:11,00:38:13,You can see they start popping up in newspapers
00:38:13,00:38:14,as being advertised.
00:38:14,00:38:15,Is it not possible?
00:38:15,00:38:18,"You know, with all great scientific discoveries,"
00:38:18,00:38:20,"or a lot of them, society as a whole"
00:38:20,00:38:22,"has progressed to a certain place,"
00:38:22,00:38:25,where it's inevitable that individuals come up
00:38:25,00:38:27,"with things simultaneously, you know?"
00:38:27,00:38:28,And they'll be on the other side of the world.
00:38:28,00:38:29,And is it possible that--
00:38:29,00:38:31,This is morphic resonance.
00:38:31,00:38:33,This is all cheap rolling across cattle grids
00:38:33,00:38:34,around the planet.
00:38:34,00:38:36,So like the Dennis the Menace thing of when they were
00:38:36,00:38:37,individually invented into--
00:38:37,00:38:38,It's not like that at all.
00:38:38,00:38:40,This is the same banana pudding that we're talking about.
00:38:40,00:38:41,It is kind of the same.
00:38:41,00:38:43,"So the Dennis the Menace thing, there"
00:38:43,00:38:46,had recently been a song called Dennis the Menace.
00:38:46,00:38:48,It was like a music whole song.
00:38:48,00:38:50,"And kind of people came up with these characters,"
00:38:50,00:38:52,probably influenced by that.
00:38:52,00:38:54,"In America, in the late 19th century,"
00:38:54,00:38:57,"they started importing bananas from different countries,"
00:38:57,00:38:58,and they started selling them.
00:38:58,00:39:00,So that was really big.
00:39:00,00:39:02,"They'd also started making ice cream more regularly,"
00:39:02,00:39:05,because they had much better ways of making ice cream.
00:39:05,00:39:06,So ice cream was new.
00:39:06,00:39:07,Bananas was new.
00:39:07,00:39:10,It was the time for banana splits to be invented.
00:39:10,00:39:15,"It's not rocket science, just merging them together."
00:39:15,00:39:17,"Apology accepted, Izzy."
00:39:17,00:39:20,"Well, I don't think I've ever had a banana split."
00:39:20,00:39:20,Have you not?
00:39:20,00:39:21,"No, I've never had one."
00:39:21,00:39:22,No.
00:39:22,00:39:23,You're not missing out.
00:39:23,00:39:24,I'd never choose one.
00:39:24,00:39:25,It's one of the least good puddings.
00:39:25,00:39:28,"Yeah, but as a child, you must have been given them,"
00:39:28,00:39:30,because it's a way to make you eat bananas.
00:39:30,00:39:33,"I read that in the UK they're known as the banana longboat,"
00:39:33,00:39:34,which I like as well.
00:39:34,00:39:34,But apparently--
00:39:34,00:39:35,I've never heard that.
00:39:35,00:39:36,Me neither.
00:39:36,00:39:40,"I think it was only in Wimpy, in the restaurant chain Wimpy."
00:39:40,00:39:42,There was one other thing that I mentioned earlier.
00:39:42,00:39:45,The Soda Fountain magazine reckoned
00:39:45,00:39:48,that the banana split was invented in Boston.
00:39:48,00:39:50,"There was an ice cream convention in 1905,"
00:39:50,00:39:52,"and there was a guy called Stinson Thomas,"
00:39:52,00:39:54,who supposedly invented it.
00:39:54,00:39:59,But Boston has since ceded its title to this place
00:39:59,00:40:01,in Pennsylvania.
00:40:01,00:40:03,Very noble of Boston.
00:40:03,00:40:07,There was even a claim I read that it was invented by someone
00:40:07,00:40:11,called Letty Lally in 1904.
00:40:11,00:40:13,"I read this is a claim that she'd invented the banana split,"
00:40:13,00:40:15,and people were claiming this back in the '50s.
00:40:15,00:40:17,But historians have since concluded--
00:40:17,00:40:19,so don't panic at Wilmington and Trobe--
00:40:19,00:40:22,"that she actually invented the banana Royale, which"
00:40:22,00:40:25,"I was not familiar with, but it's like a crap banana split"
00:40:25,00:40:26,where you chop the banana the wrong way.
00:40:26,00:40:29,You chop the banana across the waist
00:40:29,00:40:32,rather than dissecting it top to bottom.
00:40:32,00:40:35,"But multiple times, like waist, neck, knees."
00:40:35,00:40:37,And do you put ice cream in it still?
00:40:37,00:40:38,"Yeah, yeah, and you put ice cream."
00:40:38,00:40:40,"Otherwise, it's just a chopped banana."
00:40:40,00:40:42,"It seems pointless, right?"
00:40:42,00:40:43,"Yeah, just seems mad."
00:40:43,00:40:45,"I tell you what, we love inventing words."
00:40:45,00:40:48,"I know, but you're not going to be in a restaurant going,"
00:40:48,00:40:49,I see banana split on the menu.
00:40:49,00:40:51,Do you do banana Royale?
00:40:51,00:40:52,"I'm sorry, the chef can't do it."
00:40:52,00:40:53,We don't have the crockery for it.
00:40:53,00:40:55,I'm so sorry.
00:40:55,00:40:57,Reminds me of one.
00:40:57,00:41:00,So that could be the case if your bananas
00:41:00,00:41:01,"come ready split, couldn't it?"
00:41:01,00:41:03,Do you know what I mean?
00:41:03,00:41:04,"So I used to work in a restaurant,"
00:41:04,00:41:07,and we used to have scrambled eggs that came in a carton.
00:41:07,00:41:10,"And so we would make scrambled eggs in the morning,"
00:41:10,00:41:12,because you didn't have to scramble them yourself.
00:41:12,00:41:14,They came ready scrambled.
00:41:14,00:41:15,"But then people would come in and say,"
00:41:15,00:41:16,can I have a bile egg instead?
00:41:16,00:41:18,"And you'd have to say, we don't have any eggs."
00:41:18,00:41:22,"And they're like, well, what's this in front of you?"
00:41:22,00:41:23,That's so funny.
00:41:23,00:41:25,Here's another variant of it.
00:41:25,00:41:26,Have you heard of the human banana split?
00:41:26,00:41:28,"Oh, disgusting."
00:41:28,00:41:29,You cut a human in half.
00:41:29,00:41:31,That's correct.
00:41:31,00:41:32,"Oh, I know what you're doing here."
00:41:32,00:41:33,What?
00:41:33,00:41:36,Is it the fact that we share 60% of our DNA with bananas?
00:41:36,00:41:39,"No, you've made a huge reach from the fact"
00:41:39,00:41:41,that I make huge reaches all the time.
00:41:41,00:41:43,"But that makes us a literal banana split, doesn't it?"
00:41:43,00:41:44,"No, it doesn't."
00:41:44,00:41:45,Doesn't that?
00:41:45,00:41:49,Not unless you were to clone a human and a banana together.
00:41:49,00:41:52,That was the original draft of Jeff Goldblum's The Fly.
00:41:52,00:41:55,"A banana gets thrown into the machine at the last minute,"
00:41:55,00:41:57,and he comes out in a banana costume.
00:41:57,00:42:00,"No, this is-- it's a practice more than a dessert."
00:42:00,00:42:02,"It's where some people throw bananas at you,"
00:42:02,00:42:05,and then other people pour whipped cream and chocolate over you.
00:42:05,00:42:05,And it's kind of a--
00:42:05,00:42:06,Is it a sex thing?
00:42:06,00:42:07,"No, not at all."
00:42:07,00:42:08,Not at all.
00:42:08,00:42:10,It's more of a prank than a--
00:42:10,00:42:12,I've only found evidence of it happening twice.
00:42:12,00:42:15,"It feels like an only fans kind of thing, doesn't it?"
00:42:15,00:42:19,I'm sure it will be within half an hour of the show going out.
00:42:19,00:42:24,We'll have hundreds of thousands of people watching.
00:42:24,00:42:27,"Once it happened to some guy who was raising money for charity,"
00:42:27,00:42:30,"they sort of said, I'll send the videos of your human banana"
00:42:30,00:42:32,"split being made, and another time it was Gordon Ramsay"
00:42:32,00:42:33,having to-- having to him.
00:42:33,00:42:36,"It's not-- so it's not like a franchise yet, is it?"
00:42:36,00:42:38,It hasn't become a universally known--
00:42:38,00:42:40,It's not as popular as the banana split.
00:42:40,00:42:43,"No, no, I don't think it will be."
00:42:43,00:42:45,So this-- I think the reason they came about
00:42:45,00:42:49,was really because of the popularity of soda fountains.
00:42:49,00:42:51,"Right, which is such an American thing"
00:42:51,00:42:52,that we don't really have.
00:42:52,00:42:55,And they were basically there because people
00:42:55,00:42:58,"would go to the drug store, and they wanted to cure"
00:42:58,00:42:59,stuff that they had.
00:42:59,00:43:03,And people believed at the time that carbonated water--
00:43:03,00:43:04,That's got to go.
00:43:04,00:43:06,"Yeah, I'm just slipping in and out."
00:43:06,00:43:07,I'm slipping in and out.
00:43:07,00:43:10,"And these from Guatemala, and it's from Boston."
00:43:10,00:43:13,I've got some Bostonian blood.
00:43:13,00:43:16,"People would go to the pharmacy, and they"
00:43:16,00:43:19,"had these fountains, which would give them fizzy water, which"
00:43:19,00:43:21,people thought was very curative at the time.
00:43:21,00:43:23,"Like Coca-Cola was a curative thing, wasn't it?"
00:43:23,00:43:26,"Yeah, yeah, so they'd mix it up by giving them flavors,"
00:43:26,00:43:28,and the Coca-Cola and stuff.
00:43:28,00:43:31,And then they'd start adding stuff to these
00:43:31,00:43:32,to make them more appealing.
00:43:32,00:43:34,"And that's where the Sundays came about,"
00:43:34,00:43:36,and that's where the banana split came about.
00:43:36,00:43:38,"And that's why Strickler was a pharmacist,"
00:43:38,00:43:40,because he worked in a pharmacy.
00:43:40,00:43:43,"And he thought, how do I get more people to my soda fountains?"
00:43:43,00:43:44,"He was a jerk, wasn't he?"
00:43:44,00:43:45,He was a jerk.
00:43:45,00:43:46,"Yeah, a soda jerk."
00:43:46,00:43:48,"That's what they called them, soda jerks."
00:43:48,00:43:49,Yeah.
00:43:49,00:43:52,"Apparently, it was a pun on the word ""clurk."""
00:43:52,00:43:54,"Clark, clerk."
00:43:54,00:43:58,So someone who works in a pharmacy might be a clerk.
00:43:58,00:44:03,"And then your guy, who was jerking down the handle"
00:44:03,00:44:06,"to make the ice cream, he would be jerking that down,"
00:44:06,00:44:07,so he would be a soda jerk.
00:44:07,00:44:09,"Yeah, I really-- I didn't know anything"
00:44:09,00:44:11,about soda fountains and soda jerks.
00:44:11,00:44:13,We've seen them in a couple of films and things like this.
00:44:13,00:44:15,But there are so many--
00:44:15,00:44:18,"yeah, Pepsi and Coca-Cola were the next stage,"
00:44:18,00:44:20,where you got pre-made syrup.
00:44:20,00:44:22,"Because before that, everyone had their own recipes,"
00:44:22,00:44:25,and individual soda jerks would have their own things.
00:44:25,00:44:29,Cocaine was legal in these until about 1914.
00:44:29,00:44:31,"Yeah, often you just drop some cocaine in with your soda."
00:44:31,00:44:32,"A small amount, obviously."
00:44:32,00:44:34,"It's like cocktails, weren't they, really?"
00:44:34,00:44:35,Yeah.
00:44:35,00:44:36,Bit like that.
00:44:36,00:44:39,And that was a kind of golden age of crazy different recipes
00:44:39,00:44:43,"before the more uniform, really popular big drinks came in."
00:44:43,00:44:44,"But OK, I've got a few--"
00:44:44,00:44:47,It's like the Cambrian explosion of ice cream.
00:44:47,00:44:48,Yeah.
00:44:48,00:44:51,"Yeah, on a slightly smaller time frame."
00:44:51,00:44:53,"That's the thing which happened in the Tree of Life, isn't it?"
00:44:53,00:44:55,I'm only vaguely aware of the Cambrian explosion.
00:44:55,00:44:57,I just know a lot of animals came with lots of weird arms
00:44:57,00:44:59,coming off their heads and stuff.
00:44:59,00:45:00,It was exactly like that.
00:45:00,00:45:01,"OK, I wanted to tell you a few of the--"
00:45:01,00:45:03,What animals have arms coming off their heads?
00:45:03,00:45:04,Unsuccessful ones.
00:45:04,00:45:06,"OK, OK, the ones that died out."
00:45:06,00:45:11,"Well, do you want to hear a few that have died out of the ice creams?"
00:45:11,00:45:14,These are ice creams and ice creamy drinks.
00:45:14,00:45:17,So the black cow was--
00:45:17,00:45:19,Milk.
00:45:19,00:45:19,Ice cream.
00:45:19,00:45:20,I'll give you that.
00:45:20,00:45:21,Guinness.
00:45:21,00:45:23,Chocolate syrup and root beer.
00:45:23,00:45:24,Pretty close.
00:45:24,00:45:24,Yeah.
00:45:24,00:45:26,That sounds good.
00:45:26,00:45:28,"Twist it, choke it, and make it cackle."
00:45:28,00:45:32,"Well, I'd rather do it after the show."
00:45:32,00:45:35,"Twist it, choke it, and make it cackle."
00:45:35,00:45:39,"You had to kill your own chicken, and then they'd put that in."
00:45:39,00:45:43,"Well, you had to put an egg in it, so kind of close."
00:45:43,00:45:46,"OK, but they were also, for the winter, they were hot sodas."
00:45:46,00:45:47,"Because obviously, selling cold, icy sodas"
00:45:47,00:45:49,is very unpopular in the wintertime.
00:45:49,00:45:50,So they invented a load of hot drinks
00:45:50,00:45:51,to go with these machines.
00:45:51,00:45:54,"So there was hot eggnog, hot mint juleps,"
00:45:54,00:45:56,"and if you guys get any of the ingredients of this,"
00:45:56,00:46:01,I'll give you a big smile and base.
00:46:01,00:46:03,"You almost went for 1,000 points."
00:46:03,00:46:06,"But it's like, oh, I can't give them 1,000 imaginary points."
00:46:06,00:46:07,That would be terrible.
00:46:07,00:46:08,"Oh, points?"
00:46:08,00:46:09,"I thought pounds, I was hearing pounds."
00:46:09,00:46:11,I wavered between points of pounds
00:46:11,00:46:13,and thought I don't want to give either away.
00:46:13,00:46:16,The reeking smash.
00:46:16,00:46:16,Reeking smash.
00:46:16,00:46:17,What are the ingredients for?
00:46:17,00:46:18,Spinach.
00:46:18,00:46:20,No.
00:46:20,00:46:23,"Reek, so, kimchi."
00:46:23,00:46:24,"Oh, classic."
00:46:24,00:46:27,1950s American soda joking.
00:46:27,00:46:29,Korean import export.
00:46:29,00:46:31,"OK, the reeking smash."
00:46:31,00:46:33,This sounds like the worst drink I could possibly imagine.
00:46:33,00:46:35,"Water, some kind of water."
00:46:35,00:46:38,"I'm not going to give you that, actually."
00:46:38,00:46:41,"Clam juice, cream and ginger."
00:46:41,00:46:42,"Clam juice, cream and ginger."
00:46:42,00:46:45,So close with cinnamon.
00:46:45,00:46:47,It just sounds absolutely frank.
00:46:47,00:46:49,"Yeah, that's not a good combination."
00:46:49,00:46:52,"So, it's so weird to think why Coca-Cola took off"
00:46:52,00:46:54,in an environment where you could get a nice reeking smash.
00:46:54,00:46:57,Imagine if we were all drinking reeking smash now.
00:46:57,00:47:00,"Just very quickly, I was looking into other kinds"
00:47:00,00:47:01,of banana splits.
00:47:01,00:47:04,And one that I'd not actually ever heard of
00:47:04,00:47:07,was a Hannah Barbera cartoon.
00:47:07,00:47:09,"The banana splits, you haven't heard of."
00:47:09,00:47:12,"Yeah, it kind of like passed me by."
00:47:12,00:47:15,And it didn't last too long.
00:47:15,00:47:17,It was 1968 to 1970.
00:47:17,00:47:19,There was a syndication that went on a bit later.
00:47:19,00:47:22,"Can I just say also, I wasn't alive in those years."
00:47:22,00:47:24,They did repeat it quite a bit.
00:47:24,00:47:26,"Yeah, it was syndicated from '70 to '82,"
00:47:26,00:47:29,but obviously it's been on TV ever since.
00:47:29,00:47:30,And who knows in this country when.
00:47:30,00:47:32,But it was cancelled.
00:47:32,00:47:36,"So, they made a movie in 2019, the banana splits movie."
00:47:36,00:47:39,And it's amazing because this was a kids TV show.
00:47:39,00:47:42,The plotline of this movie is that the banana splits
00:47:42,00:47:45,are in studio and they're recording their show
00:47:45,00:47:47,where they discovered they were about to be cancelled.
00:47:47,00:47:50,The movie is about the murder spree
00:47:50,00:47:51,"that the banana splits go on,"
00:47:51,00:47:54,killing everyone inside the studio
00:47:54,00:47:56,because they're furious about the upcoming cancellation.
00:47:56,00:47:57,Are they actually banana splits?
00:47:57,00:47:59,'Cause I don't know how they would murder anyone.
00:47:59,00:48:02,"They were like huge sort of bear, were they bears?"
00:48:02,00:48:04,"Yeah, they were like big animals."
00:48:04,00:48:06,"Big animals, exactly."
00:48:06,00:48:07,You played in a band.
00:48:07,00:48:08,It sounds like Alpha Papa.
00:48:08,00:48:11,"Yeah, it does sound like that, which is an amazingly good film."
00:48:11,00:48:13,"It is, as I've seen that."
00:48:13,00:48:14,"But yeah, it was rated R, I believe."
00:48:14,00:48:17,"And this is, so a lot of people were furious"
00:48:17,00:48:19,because their childhood classic had come back
00:48:19,00:48:21,and they couldn't take their kids to it.
00:48:21,00:48:22,Turn it to scream.
00:48:22,00:48:23,"Yeah, exactly."
00:48:23,00:48:27,You know when Bob Barley was accused of plagiarizing that?
00:48:27,00:48:28,That TV show?
00:48:28,00:48:32,"Yeah, he was accused of plagiarizing it for Buffalo Soldier."
00:48:32,00:48:35,And it's the bit that in the theme tune that says
00:48:35,00:48:40,"Tralalala, Tralalala, Tralalala."
00:48:40,00:48:42,Oh my days.
00:48:42,00:48:43,That's the banana splits.
00:48:43,00:48:44,I don't know anything about.
00:48:44,00:48:45,"Who do you say, Bob Dylan?"
00:48:45,00:48:46,Bob Barley.
00:48:46,00:48:48,I don't know any Bob Barley songs.
00:48:48,00:48:52,"Buffalo Soldier, well, obviously it's exactly the same tune."
00:48:52,00:48:53,"I mean, it's a very simple tune"
00:48:53,00:48:55,and it's almost certainly didn't plagiarize it
00:48:55,00:48:58,"and he has been, well, people who represent him"
00:48:58,00:48:59,have been asked about it.
00:48:59,00:49:01,"I mean, that sounded bang on, I gotta say."
00:49:01,00:49:04,I'm on the side of the banana splits on this one.
00:49:04,00:49:08,"Well, a friend of Bob said he was a very serious man"
00:49:08,00:49:11,and I doubt very much he had come across something like
00:49:11,00:49:12,a banana splits.
00:49:12,00:49:14,"Well, a friend of Snorky from the banana splits said"
00:49:14,00:49:17,that bastard stole our song.
00:49:17,00:49:19,I've got one final thing about Soda Fountains
00:49:19,00:49:21,"and who killed the Soda Fountain, right?"
00:49:21,00:49:24,So this is from a piece in the New York Times
00:49:24,00:49:26,"talking about why this declined, you know,"
00:49:26,00:49:27,because they were huge.
00:49:27,00:49:28,"They were where people socialized,"
00:49:28,00:49:29,"they were where people hung out,"
00:49:29,00:49:31,they were big business as well.
00:49:31,00:49:32,So there's a theory.
00:49:32,00:49:34,"It was whoever invented the driving restaurant,"
00:49:34,00:49:37,which then was the next huge thing.
00:49:37,00:49:38,There's a theory.
00:49:38,00:49:42,It was F.D. Roosevelt who repealed prohibition.
00:49:42,00:49:43,There's another theory.
00:49:43,00:49:45,And this is all from the New York Times piece about it.
00:49:45,00:49:47,There's a guy called William Painter.
00:49:47,00:49:51,"Okay, William Painter was the person who patented"
00:49:51,00:49:54,the crimped metal bottle cap.
00:49:54,00:49:56,"- Oh, because I thought Willie Painter was the guy"
00:49:56,00:49:59,who invented the camouflage gun.
00:49:59,00:50:01,(laughing)
00:50:02,00:50:05,(laughing)
00:50:05,00:50:05,Very good.
00:50:05,00:50:08,- As you would say.
00:50:08,00:50:09,"- What's the word, sorry, what is that?"
00:50:09,00:50:11,"- You know the crimped metal bottle cap,"
00:50:11,00:50:12,like on a glass bottle of Coke.
00:50:12,00:50:13,"That bottle cap is metal,"
00:50:13,00:50:14,"but it's also got this kind of, you know,"
00:50:14,00:50:16,like ruffles around the edge of the crimps.
00:50:16,00:50:19,So that made it possible to standardize drinks.
00:50:19,00:50:19,And he actually invented that
00:50:19,00:50:21,"in around the like the early,"
00:50:21,00:50:22,the first decade of the 20th century.
00:50:22,00:50:25,- And it meant that you could buy a thousand of them
00:50:25,00:50:26,and keep them in a warehouse.
00:50:26,00:50:27,- Exactly.
00:50:27,00:50:28,- Each time someone making a new one.
00:50:28,00:50:29,"- Exactly, yeah."
00:50:29,00:50:30,- Interesting.
00:50:30,00:50:32,"- The reason I mentioned this guy, William Painter,"
00:50:32,00:50:33,is because I thought I'd try and find out
00:50:33,00:50:35,other stuff about his life and work.
00:50:35,00:50:36,"He invented a load of different things,"
00:50:36,00:50:39,"including, and I can find no more details about this,"
00:50:39,00:50:41,an ejector seat for trains.
00:50:41,00:50:43,(laughing)
00:50:43,00:50:44,- Brilliant.
00:50:44,00:50:47,- And it doesn't say whether it's for the driver
00:50:47,00:50:49,or for the passengers.
00:50:49,00:50:51,- Must be the driver.
00:50:51,00:50:53,"- Every single passenger had,"
00:50:53,00:50:56,"you see them flying into the air, 300 people."
00:50:56,00:50:59,One last thing.
00:50:59,00:51:00,- Do you know that Liz Truss's mum
00:51:00,00:51:03,used to regularly dress up as a banana?
00:51:03,00:51:04,(laughing)
00:51:04,00:51:05,- No.
00:51:05,00:51:07,"- Sorry, Amanda's a hoot, Liz Truss is."
00:51:07,00:51:09,"- Yes, sorry."
00:51:09,00:51:11,"For any international or British listeners,"
00:51:11,00:51:14,Liz Truss was the person who was momentarily
00:51:14,00:51:17,prime minister of the country a very short while ago.
00:51:17,00:51:19,- And she's the second most successful member
00:51:19,00:51:21,of her family by the sound of the chains.
00:51:21,00:51:22,- Wow.
00:51:22,00:51:24,- This actually came out in a book
00:51:24,00:51:25,"that was famously released,"
00:51:25,00:51:28,a book that's called Out of the Blue.
00:51:28,00:51:29,"Well, it was called Out of the Blue,"
00:51:29,00:51:31,the inside story of Liz Truss
00:51:31,00:51:32,and her explosive rise to power.
00:51:32,00:51:35,"And it had to be re-titled that book Out of the Blue,"
00:51:35,00:51:37,the inside story of the unexpected rise
00:51:37,00:51:39,and rapid fall of Liz Truss.
00:51:39,00:51:44,"But yeah, her mum was a big campaigner for various things."
00:51:44,00:51:46,So she moved to Eastern Europe in the 1970s
00:51:46,00:51:49,"to try out life under communism, for instance."
00:51:49,00:51:49,Yeah.
00:51:49,00:51:52,And she wanted to promote fair trade in leads
00:51:52,00:51:54,in the 1970s and she did this
00:51:54,00:51:57,by making herself a bright yellow banana costume.
00:51:57,00:51:59,And wandering around in it.
00:51:59,00:52:00,- Wow.
00:52:00,00:52:02,- And Liz Truss would say she'd go into the supermarket
00:52:02,00:52:04,"and the kids would be like,"
00:52:04,00:52:04,- She's that amazing.
00:52:04,00:52:06,- So her mum just put on her again.
00:52:06,00:52:07,- Why did Liz Truss not bring this up?
00:52:07,00:52:08,"- If she brought that up, yeah, I would be more."
00:52:08,00:52:10,"- 'Cause she kept saying she was from leads,"
00:52:10,00:52:12,she couldn't stop saying she went to school in leads.
00:52:12,00:52:14,I think I'd be saying my mum used to dress as a man.
00:52:14,00:52:15,- Do you think you would?
00:52:15,00:52:17,I think that's really on the cusp of is it gonna work
00:52:17,00:52:18,or is it gonna ruin me?
00:52:18,00:52:22,- I suppose the Tory voters are not gonna love the idea
00:52:22,00:52:25,that she was going to live on the communist government
00:52:25,00:52:26,in Eastern Europe.
00:52:26,00:52:28,- You could leave out that part.
00:52:28,00:52:29,- Or entrusted in fair trade.
00:52:29,00:52:34,"- Liz Truss, she admired Margaret Thatcher, didn't she?"
00:52:34,00:52:36,Thatcher used to work in ice cream.
00:52:36,00:52:38,"So if her mum got together with Thatcher,"
00:52:38,00:52:39,we could have had a banana split.
00:52:39,00:52:40,- A human banana split?
00:52:40,00:52:41,- Yes.
00:52:41,00:52:42,- Oh my God.
00:52:42,00:52:45,(upbeat music)
00:52:45,00:52:49,"- Okay, that's it, that is all of our facts."
