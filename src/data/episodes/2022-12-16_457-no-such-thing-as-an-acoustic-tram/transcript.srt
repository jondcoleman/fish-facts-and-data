1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,300
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:03,540
 - Hi everybody, just before we start this week's show,

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,380
 we know that Christmas is on the way

4
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,660
 and if you are hoping to do any Christmas shopping

5
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:09,260
 for the fish fan in your life,

6
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,860
 then we have some last minute recommendations

7
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:15,260
 that will save your bacon and save Christmas.

8
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,500
 - Yes, my first bacon saving recommendation

9
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,260
 is that you buy two books immediately

10
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,540
 by the sanctuary by some random

11
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,100
 called Andrew Hunter Murray.

12
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,900
 - Yes, me. - That's this guy.

13
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,540
 Look, it goes against all my principles

14
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,700
 to say this, I don't even necessarily like the guy,

15
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,060
 but it really is a brilliant book.

16
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,900
 It's got amazing reviews.

17
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,100
 It's gripping, it's about this remote island

18
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,140
 owned by a mysterious billionaire.

19
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,420
 It's very twisty, turny, thriller.

20
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,900
 It's fantastic and once you've done that,

21
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,780
 go and buy The Theory of Everything Else

22
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:50,060
 by a certain Dan Schreiber, very different kind of book.

23
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,300
 It's like getting inside Dan Schreiber's head,

24
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,780
 but in a really fun way.

25
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,220
 It's not as chaotic as you'd imagine.

26
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,100
 It's full of the amazing theories

27
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,780
 that geniuses have come up with

28
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,580
 that you definitely won't have heard of.

29
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:05,060
 It's a fascinating fact in every paragraph basically.

30
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,280
 So get those.

31
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,820
 - Absolutely, and alternatively,

32
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,380
 you can get Christmas goodies

33
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,220
 from no such thing as a fish.com.

34
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,140
 We have just launched two new t-shirts

35
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,540
 along with lovely pin badges.

36
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,540
 You can identify other fish listeners in the wild

37
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,620
 slash public by getting yourself one of these two things.

38
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,100
 There's also a lovely tour book

39
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,380
 from the recent tour we've just finished

40
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,100
 which is a complete history and demonology

41
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,180
 and future guide to fish and all its iterations.

42
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,500
 They're all so much fun

43
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,420
 and you can get them at nosuchthingasafish.com.

44
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,340
 - Yep, that's right.

45
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,780
 And now we will see this vlogging presence to you

46
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,060
 and say on with the show.

47
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,220
 - On with the podcast.

48
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,800
 (upbeat music)

49
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,540
 (upbeat music)

50
00:01:47,540 --> 00:02:01,620
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

51
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,240
 of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast

52
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,220
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

53
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,360
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

54
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,480
 I'm sitting here with James Harkin,

55
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,880
 Anna Tyshinski and Andrew Hunter Murray.

56
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,720
 And once again,

57
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,360
 we have gathered around the microphones

58
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,200
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

59
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,680
 and in a particular order, here we go.

60
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,760
 Starting with fact number one and that is Anna.

61
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,520
 - My fact this week is that many of the Muppets

62
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,320
 were designed and created by someone called Kermit Love

63
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,640
 who had absolutely nothing to do with Kermit the Frog.

64
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,160
 - When you say had nothing to do with Kermit the Frog,

65
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,040
 that's literal.

66
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,000
 It's not figuratively,

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 I will have nothing to do with Kermit the Frog.

68
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,880
 - Had huge beef from the start.

69
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,360
 Yeah, yeah, big falling out.

70
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,960
 - I think huge beef was Mr. Snuffle Upchut, you see.

71
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,840
 (laughing)

72
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,200
 - No, he just, he wasn't involved in the making of him.

73
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,840
 So Kermit Love was a designer and builder of Muppets.

74
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,400
 He was most famous probably for doing Big Bird.

75
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,280
 Was his big hit.

76
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,240
 But, you know, lots of the other ones.

77
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,840
 Snuffle Upchut, I think.

78
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,840
 Oscar the Grouch, the Cookie Monster.

79
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,800
 But Kermit was created about 10 years

80
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,560
 before he even thought about joining the Muppets.

81
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,040
 And they're just both called Kermit,

82
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,360
 which I think must have been a more common name.

83
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,680
 - It was, Mark. - And it was.

84
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,520
 - Yeah, definitely.

85
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,680
 - 'Cause there was one of the presidents

86
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,960
 had a son called Kermit, didn't he?

87
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,320
 - Yeah, Kermit Rose.

88
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,800
 - Three years old, I think, so.

89
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,120
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

90
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,480
 - I don't think he designed Big Bird.

91
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,480
 I think he helped to create the design.

92
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,480
 So there was a sort of drawing and he was,

93
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,480
 they couldn't make it work.

94
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,360
 And there are just so many design flaws in it.

95
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,960
 So they needed Kermit to come in.

96
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,800
 - Co-designed.

97
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,640
 - Co-designed.

98
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,480
 - Oh, what do you think?

99
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,240
 - It was manufactured, I guess, isn't it?

100
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,600
 - Basically, Jim Henson would draw what he wanted, I guess.

101
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,960
 And then he'd give it to people like Kermit Love,

102
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,280
 who was the main person on Big Bird,

103
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,400
 and say, "Can you make this?"

104
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,040
 And then he'd try and make it as close as possible,

105
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,880
 I suppose.

106
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,440
 - One thing about Kermit Love was that he had

107
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,280
 all this amazing experience of puppets

108
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,160
 and costumes before he joined the Muppet Show, obviously.

109
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,480
 So one of the things he'd worked on

110
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,440
 was spangling the girls at the Paris Lido.

111
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,600
 So, ballet.

112
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,720
 - That's a euphemism, isn't it?

113
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,240
 (laughing)

114
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,320
 Where were you last night?

115
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,560
 Were you spangling the girls at the Paris Lido?

116
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,120
 (laughing)

117
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,960
 - Lido as well.

118
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,720
 It's such a weird word in English, but.

119
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,800
 - What about the Lido?

120
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,920
 - It's quite a common word.

121
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,240
 - Yeah, Lido's a very common word.

122
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,760
 - I don't think that it was an open-air swimming pool.

123
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,960
 - No, that was the confusion.

124
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,920
 (laughing)

125
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,040
 - So, all--

126
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,520
 - So he's not spangling girls who are paying

127
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,480
 five pounds for a swim?

128
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,600
 - No, no, no, exactly.

129
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,680
 No, he was working with ballet dancers a lot of the time.

130
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,600
 So he worked for the New York City Ballet,

131
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,560
 and he specialised there on turning humans

132
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,760
 into half puppets.

133
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,600
 - Oh, did he?

134
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,440
 - That was a big part of his--

135
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,320
 - And of course, that's what Big Bird is, right?

136
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,160
 - Right, yeah.

137
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,760
 - It's half human, half puppet,

138
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,800
 unlike the other Muppets

139
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,000
 that are kind of actual, classic puppets.

140
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,840
 - Exactly.

141
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,040
 Well, Big What 'cause there's a human inside, do you mean?

142
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,880
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

143
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,720
 - Wow. - Yeah, sorry.

144
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,560
 (laughing)

145
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,400
 - No, you're right, sorry.

146
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,040
 - I think when the character dies one day, Big Bird,

147
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,400
 they should do a live autopsy,

148
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,520
 and all the Muppets freak out

149
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,440
 when they find a human inside.

150
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,640
 (laughing)

151
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,320
 - The design that Henson sent

152
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,880
 apparently didn't have feathers.

153
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,600
 Kermit Love added those.

154
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,420
 But that's weird, isn't it?

155
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,520
 To have a bird without any feathers.

156
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,280
 - Yeah, don't try to think of any actual birds

157
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,120
 without feathers.

158
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,960
 - I don't think there are any.

159
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,640
 - A pterodactyl, I suppose, is the early, you know.

160
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,200
 - A pterodactyl isn't a bird.

161
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,280
 Dinosaurs are birds, and yet pterodactyls aren't.

162
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,120
 - That's a weird thing.

163
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,480
 - I guess think of Cookie Monster, right?

164
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,720
 Like, I know he's not feathered,

165
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,120
 but the material could look,

166
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,200
 I could imagine a Big Bird

167
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,600
 with that kind of felt material, or whatever it is.

168
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,840
 - What I wondered is,

169
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,880
 the one birds that don't have feathers

170
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,600
 is really, really young, pre-fledgedlings,

171
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,120
 like little chicks, right?

172
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,760
 So maybe he's a really baby, that Big Bird,

173
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,240
 and he will grow up into something even bigger.

174
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,080
 - Yeah, that's good.

175
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,360
 - Does he seem quite immature?

176
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,200
 'Cause I've never actually seen--

177
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,560
 - He's actually six years old, isn't he?

178
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,120
 - Six years old, I love that.

179
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,960
 But there's an amazing detail that Kermit Love

180
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,600
 went overseas to China for a filming,

181
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,960
 and they took Big Bird and Big Bird,

182
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,360
 like the costume, 'cause they were doing that,

183
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,880
 but Big Bird was given a seat on the plane,

184
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,600
 and because he's six years old,

185
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,520
 the Chinese airline charged him half price.

186
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,360
 - Fair enough, yeah.

187
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,640
 - Well, no, what's fascinating about that is,

188
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,040
 I can't believe that you used to get

189
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,200
 half price tickets for children,

190
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,640
 because I don't pay so much money.

191
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,760
 Any time one of my million kids turns two years old.

192
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,120
 - Why don't you put the child in a Big Bird costume?

193
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,600
 - Fly them to China and make it a big publicity thing,

194
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,880
 which is why they actually did this.

195
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,800
 - Exactly, yeah, you need more publicity,

196
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,760
 that's what we're doing.

197
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,680
 Big Bird is in a way the opposite of Tinky Winky.

198
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,520
 - Oh, yeah.

199
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,160
 - Okay, can you work out why?

200
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,800
 - Well, Tinky Winky, giant purple deli-tubby,

201
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,040
 famously gay, carries a handbag.

202
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,480
 - TV on his stomach.

203
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,320
 - Thank you.

204
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,760
 - TV on his stomach.

205
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,880
 - You did all the legwork, James,

206
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,080
 and Anna just came in, came in at the end.

207
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,200
 - I think I know deli-tubby's too well,

208
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,600
 because they all have TVs on their stomachs,

209
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,480
 and I was going about what differentiates him

210
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,320
 from the other TV's.

211
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,400
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm really sorry.

212
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,440
 I should have said the opposite of a deli-tubby,

213
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,320
 but it's the, where Tinky Winky has a TV

214
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,480
 on the outside of his stomach,

215
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,480
 Big Bird has a TV on the inside of his stomach.

216
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,320
 - Really?

217
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,880
 - For the puppeteer to see what he's doing.

218
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,720
 - Wow.

219
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,560
 - Oh, that makes sense.

220
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,240
 - He just needs, basically, and it's below,

221
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,560
 it's a small TV monitor,

222
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,160
 and he just has to look down at what is going on

223
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,000
 on the monitor to see what's going on outside.

224
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,080
 - 'Cause I read that as well,

225
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,160
 but what I read didn't go into any more details.

226
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,280
 It said so he could see the set,

227
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,400
 and I couldn't work out whether the TV would be,

228
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,800
 give you a projection from Big Bird's eyes,

229
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,520
 in which case, have to have cameras in his eyes.

230
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,360
 - Yeah.

231
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,480
 - Or you're seeing the actual set,

232
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,520
 as in you're seeing yourself from, like, the third person.

233
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,360
 - Good call.

234
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,680
 - And that must be difficult, right?

235
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,520
 - Yeah.

236
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,720
 - To know where to walk if you're seeing yourself on TV.

237
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,520
 - Yeah, you'd have to invert left and right, wouldn't you?

238
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,480
 - Yeah, that's probably the least of your problems.

239
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,800
 I don't know, really.

240
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,760
 - It's like being a ghost when you leave your own body

241
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,600
 after you die, and then you look back at it.

242
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,920
 - Oh, yes.

243
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,280
 - It's not like you have to control your body then,

244
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,120
 so you don't have the difficulty.

245
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,080
 - That's why ghosts always walk through walls,

246
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,360
 'cause they don't know which way they're going,

247
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,720
 and they're like, "Oh, shit, I just walked through a wall."

248
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,560
 - Just very quickly back to Kermit Love.

249
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,640
 So one of the innovations that he brought

250
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,320
 to the design of Big Bird was malting.

251
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,760
 So he allowed for the feathers to drop off Big Bird,

252
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,200
 so it looked like, I don't know,

253
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,520
 like they were real feathers that could fall off,

254
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,120
 which was really, really nice.

255
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,960
 - Absolutely look real.

256
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,680
 - And he used 6,000 dyed feathers

257
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,280
 from a domestic white turkey, not a single one,

258
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,280
 in order to make the suit.

259
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,280
 - Oh, the suit's made of actual turkey feathers.

260
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,040
 - I think in the initial period,

261
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,560
 it's probably very different now.

262
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,560
 - Kermit Love, he usually spoke with a fake English accent,

263
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,840
 sometimes with a fake French accent.

264
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,160
 - I do the fake English accent thing.

265
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,880
 I'm like, "Yeah, you're actually, where are you from?"

266
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,840
 - I'm from Guatemala.

267
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,560
 (laughing)

268
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,800
 - And how do they speak, normally?

269
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,680
 - I can't, well, I'm not going to give up the accent now.

270
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,280
 - You can't break character.

271
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,080
 (laughing)

272
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,160
 - He made Big Bird with a guy called Christopher Lyle,

273
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,800
 who he was in a relationship with for over 50 years.

274
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,040
 So I think from before he,

275
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,520
 they started making Big Bird together, right?

276
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,240
 Until Kermit died in 2008.

277
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,400
 - Yeah, Christopher Lyle was in the pilot for the Muppet Show.

278
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,060
 - Yeah, so like right at the very, very start.

279
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,600
 - I looked at his IMDb because I thought,

280
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,920
 "Oh, what a cool guy, he seems like Christopher Lyle."

281
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,840
 And it led me to a fact that I didn't know,

282
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,880
 which is there were two pilots for the Muppet Show.

283
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,280
 So one, very kid-friendly.

284
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,280
 The second pilot was called the Muppet Show,

285
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,440
 Sex and Violence.

286
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,280
 (laughing)

287
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,960
 I was the second ever Muppet Pilot.

288
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,240
 - And did you see what it was about?

289
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,000
 - I couldn't find too much information on it, actually.

290
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,800
 - Well, it was a parody of the fact

291
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,240
 that there was starting to get lots of sex and violence

292
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,560
 on television, so people were complaining.

293
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,480
 And so they were parodying lots of different things

294
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,720
 that were happening on TV at the time.

295
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,560
 - Okay, right.

296
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,400
 - So it's not fully, it's not-

297
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,960
 - It wasn't, there wasn't, yeah.

298
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,800
 - Still on an sexy title.

299
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,800
 - Still sounds like it's not for six-year-olds.

300
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,240
 - Big Bird wasn't banging Mr. Snumpluffers.

301
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,760
 - Yeah, exactly, that's what I'd expect.

302
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,000
 - I thought it was just like, yeah.

303
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,240
 The other thing is how physically injurious it is

304
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,320
 to be a Muppeteer, one of the men.

305
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,880
 Yeah, yeah, and this is partly because of something.

306
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,440
 Oh, oh, I've got another quiz link.

307
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,280
 - Why did you just interrupt yourself then?

308
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,680
 - It's gonna be very hard to edit around that.

309
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,520
 - You're absolutely right.

310
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,360
 - What's the quiz link?

311
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,800
 - What you need to know, so what we-

312
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,520
 - I feel like we missed a lot of steps in your head.

313
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,280
 - And you need to calm down.

314
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,800
 - No, I'm so excited to be talking about Muppets.

315
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,920
 I love the Muppets so much.

316
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,760
 - Do you?

317
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,960
 - There's one link between Muppets

318
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,840
 and something that we covered recently,

319
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,520
 which is Disneyland, when Jamie was on,

320
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,720
 we mentioned Disneyland, right?

321
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,240
 And there's a link between Disneyland

322
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,080
 and the world of the Muppets.

323
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,400
 - And the world of the Muppets, okay.

324
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,680
 - I prefer that you don't mention shows

325
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,520
 when I wasn't there.

326
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,840
 - Oh, is it something about the acknowledgement

327
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,000
 of characters in real life?

328
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,920
 You have to talk to them as if they're real?

329
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,760
 - No, that's not it.

330
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,520
 - I think you said, you started off that sentence

331
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,920
 before you had the stroke,

332
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,440
 and you were talking about the puppeteers.

333
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,280
 - Yes.

334
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,120
 - So it's something to do with the puppeteers.

335
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,960
 - Something to do with the puppeteers, yeah.

336
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,800
 - Oh, okay.

337
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,640
 Oh, they have a secret tunnels.

338
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,760
 - I'm gonna say that's it.

339
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,120
 Muppet filming land is actually on the first floor.

340
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,160
 It's about eight feet above the ground

341
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,960
 so that the Muppeteers can stand upright.

342
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,480
 But the problem is, some of the Muppeteers are quite short,

343
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,520
 so then they need to wear platform shoes

344
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,880
 to get them up to the level that they've been also up to.

345
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,120
 And this brings me back to the point

346
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,520
 about Muppeteers also being physically injured.

347
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,120
 So the guy who plays Gonzo the Great,

348
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,440
 he's still going actually.

349
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,640
 He's had to have four shoulder operations

350
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,200
 just due to holding up your hand all the time

351
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,520
 and doing a hip replacement.

352
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,280
 And, you know, you're crimped.

353
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,160
 - The sacrifice people make is heroic.

354
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,600
 Guys, when you're operating a Muppet mouth,

355
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,400
 imagine you're doing that with your arm up it.

356
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,480
 Show me what you do.

357
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,200
 I know you can't see this at home,

358
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,640
 but you've all got it wrong.

359
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,880
 - You're choking.

360
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,960
 - Whatever you are doing at home,

361
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,520
 we reckon that's probably wrong as well.

362
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,280
 - I think it's unlikely you've got it right.

363
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,880
 - I'm doing a mouth with my hand, we all are.

364
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,720
 - But the key is, is that how mouth move, guys?

365
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,920
 What bit of your mouth do you move when you're talking?

366
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,840
 - Your lips.

367
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,680
 - Which lip?

368
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,600
 - Is it the bottom?

369
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,160
 - Is it you're moving your jaw?

370
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,840
 - So you say you move only the bottom?

371
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,320
 - You move only your thumb.

372
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,960
 This is what one of the operators said,

373
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,800
 I was watching an interview with him,

374
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,720
 he said, you've got to keep your top of your hand still

375
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,880
 and you move only your thumb.

376
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,880
 - That shit could have sweared.

377
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,600
 Hello, I'm a buyer.

378
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,560
 - Yeah, that does not work.

379
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,400
 - It's Pac-Man.

380
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,480
 That's how Pac-Man moves, right?

381
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,120
 - Does Pac-Man have, yes, he uses the two.

382
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,960
 - Because Pac-Man's going,

383
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,200
 (mimics Pac-Man)

384
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,040
 - Yeah, yeah.

385
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,920
 - We've got an aerial view,

386
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,920
 most likely of Pac-Man's eyes.

387
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,120
 - Well, why is he sideways?

388
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,200
 - Yeah, it doesn't make any sense.

389
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,760
 - We're about to play this thing wider.

390
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,960
 - Is he grinding along the floor?

391
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,080
 - If we've got an aerial view,

392
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,920
 he's just on the floor sideways, isn't he?

393
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,480
 - Yeah, but he's a disembodied head, right?

394
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,320
 Like, he's not human.

395
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,000
 - So why sideways? We shouldn't be able to see anything

396
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,080
 of his mouth movement from above.

397
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,920
 - He should just be a circle.

398
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,760
 - Yeah.

399
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,880
 - No, unless he's from a species with a side with his mouth.

400
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,720
 What are you talking about?

401
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,480
 - Oh, you think he has a mouth on the side of his head?

402
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,160
 - Possibly, he's an alien.

403
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,000
 - He's an alien?

404
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,840
 - He's not an alien.

405
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,640
 - Well, he's not a human.

406
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,920
 - A man implies human.

407
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,640
 - Wait, no, sorry.

408
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,240
 In later illustrations, he has legs, shoes, arms and gloves.

409
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,400
 So, yeah.

410
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,480
 - Like the M&M's, like the Cartoon M&M's.

411
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,760
 - Just like that.

412
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,240
 - Also wearing gloves.

413
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,080
 - Same universe?

414
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,920
 - Clearly they're related.

415
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,640
 - Am I thinking of the yellow M&M?

416
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,680
 - Oh, bloody hell, Dan.

417
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,520
 - You are, aren't you?

418
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,360
 - It might be.

419
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,680
 - No, I'm pretty sure Pac-Man has legs.

420
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,880
 - They do cartoons, as well, of Pac-Man.

421
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,720
 - Yeah.

422
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,560
 - In the '90s.

423
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,400
 - I didn't know that.

424
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,920
 - Is it because, do they have to have the gloves?

425
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,600
 Because it's weird seeing his hands.

426
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,400
 Like, the gloves are kind of effectively, it's sort of...

427
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,040
 - Well, the same as Mickey Mouse, right?

428
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:00,880
 - Yeah.

429
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,720
 - Why do you have gloves?

430
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,560
 - Why are all these...

431
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,760
 - He's always at a prime scene.

432
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,160
 (all laughing)

433
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,800
 - He's a snooker referee in his spare time.

434
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,880
 Mickey Mouse is the lead.

435
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,880
 - Oh, boy! What a shot!

436
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,320
 - That's not what referees do.

437
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,160
 (all laughing)

438
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,000
 - That's why I just...

439
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,640
 They're not hype men.

440
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,960
 Come on, you man!

441
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,540
 (upbeat music)

442
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:29,000
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

443
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,800
 - My fact is that the German army has just had to tear out

444
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,480
 some of the size labels from their new uniforms

445
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,080
 because they read small, short, or SS.

446
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,920
 - Ooh.

447
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,760
 - Yeah.

448
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,960
 - Oh.

449
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,800
 - Oversight.

450
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,840
 (all laughing)

451
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,280
 - A lot of small, short people in the German army.

452
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,920
 - Well, not that many, but one is too many

453
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,080
 to have the SS label in their clothes.

454
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,920
 - I agree.

455
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,000
 - So, yeah, most of them were small, medium, large,

456
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,640
 and extra large, and that's fine.

457
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,680
 But the SS stands for the Schuttstaffel,

458
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,400
 who are the Nazi paramilitary organization

459
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,720
 who largely ran the Holocaust.

460
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,360
 And it is literally illegal to display their symbols

461
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,680
 in Germany.

462
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,080
 So the German defense ministry had ordered the soldiers

463
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,080
 to tear out the SS lettering.

464
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,600
 I mean, they weren't on display either.

465
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,360
 It was literally just a size label in some--

466
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,520
 - Unless you're wearing it inside out,

467
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,440
 which often, if you get up in the dark,

468
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,040
 put your clothes on, that's suddenly on display.

469
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,840
 - I think that's an offence on the parade ground, though,

470
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,080
 to have your uniform inside out.

471
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,440
 I don't know much about military discipline,

472
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,280
 but I imagine--

473
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,040
 - I imagine they say, get down and give me 10

474
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,040
 if you do that.

475
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,680
 Yeah, pretty sure.

476
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,080
 - They said if you cut it out, that's one thing.

477
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,400
 But if it's got important information on it,

478
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,200
 what you should do is cut around the SS,

479
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,200
 so just lose the actual--

480
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,040
 - They didn't say that.

481
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,880
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

482
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,080
 - So it's still the shape of an S and an S.

483
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,320
 (all laughing)

484
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,400
 - Not important information is going to be on an S.

485
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,240
 - The washing instructions.

486
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,080
 - The washing, yeah.

487
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,960
 - You know, what if you accidentally put it in at 60?

488
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,880
 - No one's ever read those on any item of clothing.

489
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,600
 - Oh, excuse me, I'm not strong this way.

490
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,880
 (all laughing)

491
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,680
 It's my regular reading.

492
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,360
 Regular reading.

493
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,200
 You're getting a shirt.

494
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,640
 Oh, I can't wait to read this.

495
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,440
 - Can I ask, what is the German for small shorts?

496
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,520
 Presumably it's SS in German.

497
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,880
 - Well, that would be KK, which is Clyde, Clyde.

498
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,720
 - So how come--

499
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,560
 - Is it English?

500
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,680
 - I think the supplier would have been

501
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,600
 English language and that's why it was a problem.

502
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,840
 - KK is still, what isn't it?

503
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,320
 'Cause you do feel, you sense that lingering third K.

504
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,720
 - If you're a really, really small soldier

505
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,560
 (all laughing)

506
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,680
 and you're a KKK, that is a problem.

507
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,520
 - I didn't realize that though

508
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,960
 about the SS being a combination of words

509
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,520
 that is banned in certain places.

510
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,360
 Like one of the things which was in the article

511
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,560
 that you sent around Andy was that SS on number plates

512
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,640
 is not allowed in most spots in Germany.

513
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,480
 - Is that right?

514
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,640
 - Yes, you can't have SS, you can't have KZ

515
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,640
 because that references concentration camps.

516
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,040
 You can't have HJ because that's the Hitler youth,

517
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,880
 you can't have--

518
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,720
 - I'm sorry.

519
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,600
 - Yeah, because there are German words.

520
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,400
 Yeah, it doesn't sound like it makes sense,

521
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,240
 but--

522
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,640
 - HJ is also a rude thing.

523
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,000
 - I like hand jobby sinking.

524
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,840
 - Oh!

525
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,240
 - What's handjob in German though?

526
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,400
 - Actually testing my GCSE German now.

527
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,240
 (all laughing)

528
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,800
 It actually didn't come up either in the--

529
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,640
 - Not in the aural.

530
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,440
 (all laughing)

531
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,800
 - I found some German military uniforms

532
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,360
 which are literally made of cardboard,

533
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,040
 which is an interesting thing.

534
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,320
 And it's not in Germany.

535
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,560
 It's in Namibia, which was a German colony

536
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,040
 until after the First World War.

537
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,400
 And there is a group of people living there,

538
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,960
 the Herrero tribe.

539
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,360
 And I think though, like a lot of colonized people

540
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,640
 is treated pretty badly.

541
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,080
 - Genocide, I believe.

542
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,920
 - Right.

543
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,240
 - Yeah, all the way, all the way to genocide.

544
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,600
 - One of the worst ways to be treated.

545
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,080
 - Yes, well the Herrero people now

546
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,680
 wear a lot of Edwardian European,

547
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,720
 specifically German clothing for traditional rituals

548
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,360
 and for special days and things like that.

549
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,120
 So if you go to a Herrero funeral,

550
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,440
 the women will be wearing Edwardian dresses

551
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,720
 that were popular in Germany in 1910.

552
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,040
 And the men will be wearing uniforms

553
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,320
 that are some of them made of cardboard

554
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,160
 because they've been replicated to be exactly like

555
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,320
 the fashions of that time.

556
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,840
 - And it's really similar to the Bolivian Cholitas

557
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,240
 that we talked about a few weeks ago.

558
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,400
 And also it was the women who adopted this first

559
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,880
 by some way, I think they adopted

560
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,400
 the European style of dress,

561
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,160
 but then much like the Cholitas,

562
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,360
 they made it much more full of bright colors

563
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,840
 like the clothes that they wore.

564
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,640
 So yeah, and they've got these beautiful hybrid

565
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,680
 Edwardian dresses with these colorful colors on them.

566
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,520
 - That's awesome.

567
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,680
 - You know, Germany gave Namibia $1.35 billion

568
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,880
 in a couple of years ago, I think it was.

569
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,920
 I just thought that was very interesting

570
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,760
 when people talk about compensating.

571
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,040
 In compensation, they said this was a genocide

572
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,560
 and his $1.5 billion to develop.

573
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,880
 So 1.3 times.

574
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,760
 - I wonder what you get in the Herrero embassy

575
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,080
 whenever you go there.

576
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,480
 (all laughing)

577
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,320
 - Wait, I don't get it.

578
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,840
 - So what do you get for a year at an embassy party?

579
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,480
 There's someone going around with a tray.

580
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,160
 - I get it, I get it, I get it.

581
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,160
 Yeah, yeah, it's a quality stream.

582
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,440
 (all laughing)

583
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,960
 - Have we mentioned this about French military uniforms

584
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,760
 and Napoleon and the baguette?

585
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,840
 - Yeah, yeah, supposedly the baguette was invented

586
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,160
 so you could hide it in your trousers.

587
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,000
 - Oh, that's right.

588
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,840
 Yeah, we have talked about that.

589
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,680
 - Hopefully, okay.

590
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,520
 - Sort of like hidden down the inside.

591
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,280
 - But it would just fit in the trouser pockets

592
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,120
 of the army uniform.

593
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,440
 I just couldn't remember if we'd--

594
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,560
 - Can I just say, well, we're talking about Napoleon

595
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,520
 and we might not keep all this in anyway

596
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,960
 'cause we have mentioned it before.

597
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,160
 But this morning, I was reading a book about cannibalism

598
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,880
 and there was a nursery rhyme in it.

599
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,880
 And apparently it was a genuine nursery rhyme.

600
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,640
 Baby, baby, naughty baby.

601
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,000
 Hush you, squalling thing, I say.

602
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,080
 Peace this moment.

603
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,040
 Peace, or maybe, Bonaparte will pass this way.

604
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,560
 And he'll beat you, beat you, beat you.

605
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,680
 And he'll beat you all to pop.

606
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,720
 And he'll eat you, eat you, eat you.

607
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,160
 Every morsel, snap, snap, snap.

608
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,360
 - Not sure about this bedtime story

609
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,360
 when you're waiting for your daughter.

610
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,440
 - And I will be appearing on CBVs tomorrow evening

611
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,760
 for the bedtime story.

612
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,760
 - So yeah, they made the uniform

613
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,280
 so you could put a baguette in your pocket

614
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,480
 and then you could always do the joke.

615
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,480
 Is that a gun in your pocket or is it?

616
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,120
 - Or is that a hungry?

617
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,360
 - It's a sandwich, yeah.

618
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,160
 - Have you read about how modern military uniforms

619
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,880
 in America are progressing at the moment?

620
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,760
 It's, they're turning them basically into computers,

621
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,800
 which means that anything that happens on your outfit

622
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,920
 can be reported back to base.

623
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,480
 So if you're shot, your suit will know with a spot

624
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,960
 because it can sense a change.

625
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,840
 - Other computers good enough that they can,

626
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,840
 if the soldier's been shot,

627
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,800
 can the computer make the soldier keep running, basically?

628
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,120
 - Not yet, see that's like a Robocop.

629
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,200
 We haven't got to Robocop yet,

630
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,000
 but it can tell GPS, it can tell literally the liquid level

631
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,760
 of how much heat you're exerting

632
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,120
 and if you're in trouble or whatever.

633
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,640
 It's just got all the information,

634
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,400
 all the data is now being collected.

635
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,000
 - Yeah, yeah, nice.

636
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,800
 - I don't know if they can send it right back overseas, I think.

637
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,160
 - I think if you can send it over the internet

638
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,640
 from one place to another,

639
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,680
 it could probably go all the way around the world.

640
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,800
 - That's not on the internet, right James?

641
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,960
 - It's on this guy.

642
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,960
 - If he wants attached to the Pentagon,

643
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,920
 it's like a massive cable, it's like a dolly.

644
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,920
 - Pull them out, pull them out,

645
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,800
 'cause someone literally pulls them all out.

646
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,040
 - I don't know how reassuring it is

647
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,280
 if someone says to you, "Here's your suit,"

648
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,120
 and the good thing is,

649
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,120
 when you get shot multiple times in the chest,

650
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,560
 we'll have a computer back home

651
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,360
 that knows exactly where you've been shot.

652
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,840
 - 'Cause there's a thing called the golden hour

653
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,080
 after a soldier's been injured,

654
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,080
 which is the time to really,

655
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,080
 whereas you're most likely to save their life.

656
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,920
 And there's also a thing,

657
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,760
 I think, called something like the platinum five minutes,

658
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,720
 which is even more,

659
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,960
 you can do absolutely the most to save their life.

660
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,920
 And then there's the diamond five seconds,

661
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,800
 where you just put your arm and pull the bullet out,

662
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,920
 and it's like, nothing happened.

663
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:36,240
 - So why do you think the SAS had so many condoms

664
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,120
 in the first Gulf War?

665
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,760
 - Okay.

666
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,840
 - Is it to do with burns?

667
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,240
 Only 'cause we were once told to bring condoms

668
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,760
 to stop burning, but Dan's got it.

669
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,800
 - It's water, it's water, yep.

670
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,640
 They took loads of condoms

671
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,240
 'cause they can hold about a liter of water each.

672
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,360
 And if you're on the run, it's very useful.

673
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,200
 If you pass a stream,

674
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,880
 quickly fill up your condoms with water.

675
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,160
 You've got a liter of water there.

676
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,560
 - We'll taste quite spermicide-y.

677
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,200
 - Might be one of the strawberry ones, might get lucky.

678
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,840
 (laughing)

679
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,840
 But then, so that kind of led me on to this.

680
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:09,840
 In 1991, the British army ordered half a million bespoke

681
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,120
 camouflage condoms.

682
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,320
 - That's a great idea.

683
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,400
 - Can you tell me why?

684
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,240
 - Well.

685
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,080
 - Sand coloured.

686
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:18,900
 - Oh, sand coloured.

687
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,240
 - For the Gulf War, that was, yeah, yeah, yeah.

688
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,640
 - If you forget to do up your flies

689
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,960
 after you've been to the Lou,

690
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,720
 you're always wearing a camouflage condom,

691
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,560
 so it doesn't matter.

692
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:30,880
 - You lie down in the sand with only your penis stick out,

693
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,680
 but you don't want anyone to shoot it.

694
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,520
 (laughing)

695
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,360
 So you have to cover it in a condom.

696
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,240
 - It's the periscope, it's the, yeah, yeah.

697
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,080
 - Right.

698
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,920
 - It's for the rifles.

699
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,560
 - To cover the rifles, to stop any water getting in.

700
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,800
 - Yeah, and sand did the tip.

701
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,280
 It can be seriously debilitating if you're firing a rifle.

702
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,720
 - At the end of World War I, in New York City,

703
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,720
 they had a tower of 12,000 pickle halbers,

704
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,600
 which are those kind of helmets with a spike on top,

705
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,680
 you know, like German helmets.

706
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,280
 It was like a victory parade.

707
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,760
 They got a massive pyramid of these helmets

708
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,800
 in the middle of New York, and then they sold them off.

709
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,080
 But the idea was, look, we've won the war

710
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,280
 and we've got all these trophies and whatever.

711
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,000
 Now the thing is that the Germans

712
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,160
 didn't really use these helmets.

713
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,280
 They used them in the 19th century,

714
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,960
 but then they were really phased out

715
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,520
 during the start of the 20th century,

716
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,960
 and they were completely replaced in 1916 by steel helmets

717
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,400
 because they're made of leather,

718
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,760
 the ones with the spike on.

719
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,480
 They don't help you really in any way.

720
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,320
 - And they're conspicuous as well.

721
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,360
 If you're in a trench and just you can see a spike

722
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,200
 moving back and forth, yeah.

723
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,040
 - Yeah, they're no use.

724
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,200
 They were replaced by steel helmets,

725
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,520
 but they had all these old ones,

726
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,960
 so they put them in an old warehouse,

727
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,160
 and then the Americans captured the warehouse,

728
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,320
 took all the helmets out,

729
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,760
 and then showed them as these are our spoils of war,

730
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,400
 as if they'd taken them from the soldiers,

731
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,120
 but they didn't take them from an old thing.

732
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:52,960
 - Wow, very clever.

733
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,800
 - And the reason you had the spike

734
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,720
 is because it's from the older days

735
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,800
 you might have a big plume on the side,

736
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,600
 like a ceremonial helmet,

737
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,480
 and that was kind of the spike would hold the plume.

738
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,320
 - I was wondering if it was

739
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,480
 the old Ben Franklin lightning rod hat.

740
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,360
 (laughing)

741
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,200
 - I didn't realize.

742
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,280
 Loads of other armies have them.

743
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,840
 - Oh yeah, today they have them.

744
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,720
 - Yeah, so the British household cavalry used to have a spike.

745
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,000
 The US Marine Corps, Russian, Swedish.

746
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,240
 - All for plume purposes, is that the--

747
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,800
 - I think almost all, yeah.

748
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,200
 But the Prussian army had changed theirs in 1844.

749
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,240
 They ended in a ball because people kept on

750
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,640
 injuring their horses or damaging equipment or whatever.

751
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,160
 - They think with the lightning rods

752
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,320
 was you had the spike versus the ball as well, didn't you?

753
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,160
 - Oh yeah.

754
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,600
 And maybe lightning kept happening, exactly.

755
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,840
 (laughing)

756
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,680
 Yeah.

757
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,480
 - Interesting, yeah, today I think ceremonially only,

758
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,440
 but you would see them in South America, I think,

759
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,080
 or the Romanian army, maybe.

760
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,040
 - Oh, back in Guatemala, the Tenerpene,

761
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,600
 you'd see them every day.

762
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,640
 (laughing)

763
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,640
 - Have you guys ever seen the Landsknecht mercenaries,

764
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,640
 pictures of drawings of these?

765
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,480
 - Not sure.

766
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,680
 - These were Germans who fought

767
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,320
 between the 1400s and the 1600s.

768
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,640
 They made up the majority of the Holy Roman Empire.

769
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,200
 They were like the elite fighting force.

770
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,960
 So they were using mostly pikes and crossbows,

771
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,080
 but they also used these things called zvi henders,

772
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,440
 which were swords that were way taller

773
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,520
 than the soldier himself.

774
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,520
 So they looked like they're carrying,

775
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,520
 I mean, you have to carry them over your shoulder

776
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,360
 and it looks ridiculous.

777
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,200
 - That's the point.

778
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,880
 It must be way too heavy to wheel.

779
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,960
 - I know, I know.

780
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:29,440
 I think the idea was you could basically get at your enemy

781
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,560
 'cause your sword was longer,

782
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,360
 but I think it wasn't that practical in the end.

783
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,120
 - You could think in the really early days of warfare,

784
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,200
 when all you had was a sword,

785
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,200
 having a slightly longer sword than your enemy

786
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,320
 would be an advantage.

787
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,240
 - Yeah, yeah, and then it's an arms race, yeah.

788
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,760
 - Eventually you've got a mile long sword.

789
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,040
 - That was what the arms race was.

790
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,880
 It's not so sweet.

791
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,720
 Back in the day, the arms race

792
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,280
 was just adding a cent to me through our drinks.

793
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,320
 - To your arm, yeah.

794
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,720
 (laughing)

795
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,240
 You breed soldiers with super long arms of actually,

796
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,120
 you know, Mr. Tickle in his time was a ferocious warrior.

797
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,600
 - He had to donate sperm every month, didn't he,

798
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,080
 for this new legion.

799
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,880
 He was very good at donating sperm.

800
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,960
 It was very easy for him, obviously.

801
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,800
 - I would think it would be quite awkward

802
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,360
 if you're Mr. Tickle, 'cause it's easy

803
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,840
 to reach things a long way from you, but your own penis.

804
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,640
 - Yeah, you're saying you're so right.

805
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,920
 - I don't think we've got any data

806
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,840
 about Mr. Tickle's penis though.

807
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,960
 Was it, you know, is everything that long and tickly?

808
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,180
 (laughing)

809
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,760
 (upbeat music)

810
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:28,560
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

811
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,720
 and that is my fact.

812
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:34,000
 My fact is that in 2015, the actor Vicky McClure

813
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,560
 was kicked off the Vicky McClure tram

814
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,800
 for not having a ticket.

815
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,240
 - So, I think she shouldn't have to have a ticket

816
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,400
 if the tram's named after her.

817
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,320
 - Turned out she didn't need to have a tram ticket.

818
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,440
 Just the ticket inspector didn't realize that

819
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,160
 and kicked her off for their evasion.

820
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,000
 So Nottingham is where this tram is,

821
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,640
 and it's the Nottingham Express Transit,

822
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,360
 and they have a lot of trams

823
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,120
 that have a lot of local hero names on it.

824
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,440
 Vicky McClure and--

825
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,520
 - Who is she, sorry?

826
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,440
 - She's, oh yeah, sorry.

827
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,280
 So Vicky McClure is an actor.

828
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,000
 You might have seen her in line of duty.

829
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,720
 You might have seen her in the replacement.

830
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,560
 You might have seen her.

831
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,240
 - She's-- - The replacement bus journey?

832
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,760
 (laughing)

833
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,360
 - She's a very big British actor, yeah, huge deal.

834
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,800
 And yeah, so in 2015, she was offered this

835
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,360
 for it to be named after her.

836
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,960
 She accepted it, she's very excited.

837
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,880
 She brought her mother along to the ceremony.

838
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,040
 She sort of officially unveiled it,

839
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,800
 got onto the tram for the inaugural ride,

840
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,480
 and then the conductor said, "Where's your ticket?"

841
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,040
 And she said, "I don't have one on Vicky McClure."

842
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,120
 And he said, "Yeah, we're all Vicky McClure, get off."

843
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,360
 - And yeah. - Nottingham has a lot of

844
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,360
 trams named after people. - There's a lot of them.

845
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,760
 - There's a lot of them.

846
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,400
 So I'm gonna say a few names.

847
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,240
 Martin Polyakov, scientist.

848
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,800
 - Yes. - Big deal scientist.

849
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,520
 D.H. Lawrence, sex writer.

850
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:55,040
 Krzysztof Brot, tour villain dean.

851
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,520
 I don't know if that's one tram or two, actually.

852
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,360
 - It's one, yeah. - Shame.

853
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,040
 - Who gets the front half and who gets the back half?

854
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,320
 - Trams, trams.

855
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,880
 Okay, did you know that there's an annual

856
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,560
 tram bowling competition every year?

857
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,560
 - We sure did.

858
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,720
 (laughing)

859
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,000
 - But tell us more. - Pretty exciting.

860
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,320
 So every year there is the European

861
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,360
 tram driver competition, which is a competition

862
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,600
 which sees tram drivers from all over Europe

863
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,520
 gathering together to compete against each other

864
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,920
 to find the greatest tram driver of all.

865
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,840
 They do things like trams billiards.

866
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,000
 They do tram bowling.

867
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,640
 So tram bowling would be, you've got giant pins

868
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,360
 that are at the end of a little track,

869
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,200
 and you've got a tram racing down,

870
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,680
 and two people are holding the ball,

871
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,440
 and it nudges the ball, and it tries to not.

872
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,920
 It's a huge inflatable ball.

873
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,120
 It's not your average bowling ball.

874
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,760
 - No. - I think what's interesting is

875
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,840
 that's quite obvious what that would be,

876
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,080
 but tram billiards on the other hand.

877
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,640
 - Good point. - Which you haven't explained.

878
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,120
 - No, I'm-- - Tram billiards,

879
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,000
 I couldn't tell you what tram billiards is.

880
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,040
 Tram billiards doesn't bid that much

881
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,480
 relation to actual billiards,

882
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,200
 but it looks like a really boring spectator sport.

883
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:58,120
 It is where a tram goes very slowly and cautiously

884
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:02,200
 towards a table, which has got lots of scores written on it,

885
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,600
 and coming out of the table is kind of a channel

886
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,240
 with a little ball at the end,

887
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,480
 and the tram nudges into the channel

888
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,280
 and knocks the ball onto the table,

889
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,320
 and whatever score the ball lands on.

890
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,840
 - Oh, so it's shuffleboard.

891
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,800
 Shuffleboard isn't-- - Yeah, or shove-hateney.

892
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,000
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I like that.

893
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,400
 - But there are more exciting events than that,

894
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,240
 even more exciting.

895
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,360
 There's stopping within 20 centimetres of a cone

896
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,480
 without hitting it. - Yeah, pretty cool.

897
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,040
 - That's good. (laughing)

898
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,800
 - What does that entail? (laughing)

899
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,200
 - Accelerate to exactly 30 kilometres an hour

900
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,000
 without a speedometer.

901
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,840
 That's pretty good.

902
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,560
 - How do they remove the speedometer from this?

903
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,480
 - I don't know if it's quite a technical thing.

904
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,280
 - I think you put some black masking tape

905
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,600
 over it or something. - That's not what it says.

906
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,200
 It says without the speedometer.

907
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,360
 - Yeah, yeah, they have to commission hundreds

908
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,280
 of new trams every year for this.

909
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,880
 - It's the most expensive sport in Europe.

910
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,360
 - Yeah, so trams, when I was reading about this,

911
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,800
 I realized trams were much more revolutionary

912
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,200
 than I had realised, and I think we said that a lot,

913
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,320
 but it is true.

914
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:04,320
 So they were the way that you got around for about 100 years.

915
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,040
 - They still are in some places.

916
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,480
 - But there wasn't other options,

917
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,080
 or there weren't many other options.

918
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,120
 So they took over from horse and carts really.

919
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,840
 So the first trams were horse drawn, of course.

920
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,680
 The first horse car was 1807,

921
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,360
 the Swansea and Mumbles Railway.

922
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,200
 - So those are, just to be clear on what a tram is,

923
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,320
 it's on tracks, but it shares space with the road

924
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,160
 at some points. - Yes, yes.

925
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,200
 - Whereas the train is on tracks,

926
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,600
 but it has its own complete space.

927
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,600
 - Yeah, exactly, yeah, yeah.

928
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,880
 So the Swansea and Mumbles Railway

929
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,640
 actually was commissioned in 1804

930
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,120
 and just carried goods and freight,

931
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,760
 and lots of kids used to hitch rides on it

932
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,520
 to get from Swansea to Mumbles.

933
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,880
 And so they thought, well, maybe we should make

934
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,000
 this a passenger thing.

935
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,440
 And so that became the first passenger one.

936
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,240
 And then there were still no other trams for about 50 years.

937
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,040
 - And then George Train came along.

938
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:52,120
 - George Train blinded in. - Brilliantly named George Train.

939
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:56,000
 He went into trams, and he made one in Birkenhead,

940
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,880
 and he invited all the crown heads of Europe

941
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,040
 to the ground opening and none of them came.

942
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,640
 (all laughing)

943
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,640
 - Oh, really? - Wow.

944
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,440
 - It's Birkenhead, it's quite hard to get to.

945
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,760
 - Oh, okay, fair enough.

946
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,360
 - But we've invited all the crown heads of Europe

947
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,280
 to our Christmas show,

948
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,720
 which is coming up in a few days at the time of recording.

949
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,680
 I think they will be there.

950
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,880
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

951
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,080
 - And he founded the football team,

952
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,800
 didn't he, Train Merovers?

953
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,440
 - Brilliant, a Birkenhead joke, amazing.

954
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,280
 - What was it?

955
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,760
 - That's where Tranmiera from, Birkenhead.

956
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,160
 - I've got to be honest. - Okay.

957
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,280
 - I did not intend that.

958
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,240
 - That is an extraordinary coincidence.

959
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,080
 Well done.

960
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,200
 - Because it was such a shockingly bad joke

961
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,240
 that I thought there must have been something extra there.

962
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,400
 - So did I. - Wow.

963
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,240
 - And there was.

964
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,600
 - So James did all the work to make that work, that's great.

965
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,920
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

966
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,880
 - And then he started one in London, George Train.

967
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,000
 I went from Marble Arch to Bayswater,

968
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,040
 and it was very popular.

969
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:45,880
 Lots of people used it,

970
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,400
 apart from anyone who lived nearby,

971
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,520
 because there were lots of really, really posh houses

972
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,880
 around there, and anyone who lived there

973
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,480
 had to cross over the line to get to Hyde Park.

974
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,040
 They were just walking across,

975
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,000
 now they had to get past the tram line,

976
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 and people would just smash it up.

977
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,200
 - The tram lines were raised, weren't they?

978
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,440
 And it was a complete pain in the bum to walk around,

979
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,160
 to walk over and all of this, yeah, yeah.

980
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:10,760
 In 1952, all the final trams left London,

981
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,680
 and the tracks were torn up and all of this.

982
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,120
 And this is a cool thing.

983
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,480
 The final journey of the trams went from Woolwich to New Cross,

984
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,240
 and it took three extra hours to normal,

985
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,760
 because of the crowds cheering it along the way.

986
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,160
 And the driver of the final tram, this is so nice.

987
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,240
 There's a guy called John Cliff,

988
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,320
 who was the deputy chairman of London Transport,

989
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,360
 and he had started his career as a tram driver

990
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,920
 52 years before, and he got to drive the final one,

991
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,400
 which is just like that, you know that Fraser thing?

992
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,240
 So in the first episode,

993
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:44,360
 someone brings in Martin's horrible chair,

994
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,280
 and when Fraser's dad is moving in,

995
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,280
 and then in the final ever episode, 11 years later,

996
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,000
 someone, a removal man, comes in to take the chair away,

997
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,400
 and it's the same removal man.

998
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,520
 And that's the best example you could think of

999
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,320
 of someone going through their whole career doing that.

1000
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,640
 Well, it's the most relatable one, isn't it?

1001
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,840
 We all know it, it's going to be understood.

1002
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,440
 Judge Train was later declared a lunatic and arrested

1003
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,440
 for reading the scripture in support of Victoria Woodhull,

1004
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,440
 the suffragette.

1005
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,640
 When trams went electric, so that was a huge step.

1006
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,840
 They were horse drawn for ages.

1007
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,480
 Was it accepted, or was it like Dylan going electric?

1008
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,400
 No, people prefer the acoustic trams for a long time.

1009
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,520
 (laughing)

1010
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,240
 They, yeah, they went electric in Britain

1011
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,960
 in the sort of 1880s and 1890s.

1012
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:33,200
 And so now we tend to have trams with the cables above,

1013
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,560
 but they used to be under the ground.

1014
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,200
 That was a bit of an issue because then the rails

1015
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,880
 would be electrified, so if you stepped on them,

1016
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,000
 that was a problem.

1017
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,640
 So they had this cool system called contact studs,

1018
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,720
 which is where basically along the tram rail,

1019
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,800
 you'd have these big metal studs

1020
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,920
 and they were connected to an electricity supply underground,

1021
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,520
 but they would be switched off and they would be triggered

1022
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,440
 to switch on when the tram ran over them

1023
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,760
 by a magnet on the tram.

1024
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,600
 Brilliant.

1025
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,560
 It sounds brilliant.

1026
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,720
 They're really unreliable and they often stayed live.

1027
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,400
 So what you had to do with the contact studs

1028
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:12,800
 was employ street urchins often to go and stand on the rails

1029
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,720
 and say, look, we think this is not live anymore,

1030
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,880
 but could you just step on that rail?

1031
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,080
 Are you joking?

1032
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:19,920
 No.

1033
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,240
 This is a complicated electrical job.

1034
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,240
 We need an urchin to do it.

1035
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,880
 No, no, because they were just testing it.

1036
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,120
 They were literally there to see if they got electrified.

1037
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,880
 And how badly would they be electrified?

1038
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,520
 Pretty bad.

1039
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,720
 Like horses would sometimes leap up

1040
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,640
 and then drop down stone dead.

1041
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,320
 I think they use a horse.

1042
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,480
 Yeah, they should have used a horse.

1043
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,240
 They're all out of work.

1044
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:37,760
 Terrific.

1045
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,920
 Yeah, it's pretty bad.

1046
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:42,120
 Let's say I grew up near Manchester and they have trams there

1047
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,360
 and I was always worried that they might be electrified

1048
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,120
 and didn't want to stand on the tracks the next they were.

1049
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,600
 I'd see so many urchins go up.

1050
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:55,000
 Can I tell you one cool thing about tram design?

1051
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,120
 I don't need to guess why it exists.

1052
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,960
 So they would have spiral, old trams would have spiral staircases.

1053
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,080
 So you get up to the top level.

1054
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,120
 I've been on one.

1055
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,880
 Yep, and you've got a driver.

1056
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,560
 That's my clue.

1057
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,440
 Picture the driver.

1058
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,600
 Is the driver on the top like an old horse and cart

1059
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,040
 where you'd have a--

1060
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,040
 No, bottom.

1061
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,280
 He's at the bottom.

1062
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:18,400
 And there was one step on the spiral that's full of little holes.

1063
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,960
 Why do you think it's full of little holes?

1064
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,800
 Did he have shoes which he could click in like a Lego,

1065
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,840
 a piece of Lego into there?

1066
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,480
 And then he's stuck fast and he wouldn't fall over

1067
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,800
 when it went round the corner.

1068
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,960
 But if he's driving, is that for the conductor, for example?

1069
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,560
 I was thinking conductor's mode.

1070
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,520
 It's related to the conductor.

1071
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,320
 But it's about if the conductor is a pervert.

1072
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,920
 Oh, uh, oh, what?

1073
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,080
 You were so excited.

1074
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,200
 I didn't know, but I just thought of--

1075
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,440
 A spiral staircase looking at women's skirts.

1076
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,400
 You're bang on.

1077
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:45,900
 Oh.

1078
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:50,840
 So this was-- well, you're sort of there,

1079
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,440
 if I'd ask you a follow-up question.

1080
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,600
 Basically, the holes are there because the driver needs

1081
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,640
 to be able to see over his left shoulder

1082
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,640
 and the stairs block his view unless you put holes in.

1083
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,440
 So there were holes in one step so he could look over his left

1084
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,080
 shoulder.

1085
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:06,640
 But they always came with a screen that you could pull down.

1086
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,880
 And that was because if the tram's going the other way

1087
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,280
 and the conductor's at the stairs end,

1088
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,440
 he can look through the holes at ladies' ankles.

1089
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,640
 Ankles, oh no.

1090
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:20,160
 Ankles, even worse than up the skirts in those days.

1091
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,040
 I wonder if-- you know, if you're an urchin.

1092
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1093
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,200
 And they wanted you to kind of stand on this electrical thing.

1094
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,720
 Do you think they tricked you by saying,

1095
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,280
 do you want to be a conductor?

1096
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:34,840
 And you said, well, just stand on these--

1097
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:39,520
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

1098
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,920
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show.

1099
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,360
 And that is James.

1100
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,520
 OK, my fact this week is that because nobody

1101
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,400
 can decide where it was invented,

1102
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:51,400
 there's currently a split in the banana splits world.

1103
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,040
 Brilliant.

1104
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,320
 Some people say Croatia, don't they?

1105
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,300
 Yes.

1106
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:03,360
 There was also the banana Zagreb and the Brovnik.

1107
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,280
 So yeah, two places in America, basically.

1108
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,600
 In fact, we might come on to it.

1109
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,760
 There was also a third pretender.

1110
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,760
 But mainly two places in America,

1111
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,400
 a place called Wilmington, Ohio, and La Trobe, Pennsylvania.

1112
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,560
 And Wilmington say that it was invented by a guy

1113
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,200
 called E.R. Hazard, who supposedly came up

1114
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,600
 with banana splits, which is basically you take a banana,

1115
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,360
 you split it in half, you put ice cream in the middle of it.

1116
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:32,400
 He supposedly invented it to attract students to his shop.

1117
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,200
 But they reckon that he did it in something

1118
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,280
 like 1907 or 1908.

1119
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,120
 And yet, there is a lot of evidence

1120
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,520
 that they existed before that.

1121
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:44,240
 So no one's having to go at Wilmington or anything.

1122
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,960
 But it seems very unlikely that they are the real ones.

1123
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,800
 You're taking the side here.

1124
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,920
 You think it was the other one?

1125
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,160
 I actually think that possibly it was neither.

1126
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,320
 But certainly on these two, I think

1127
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:57,160
 La Trobe, Pennsylvania definitely has the better claim

1128
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,240
 because they have evidence that there

1129
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,800
 was a guy called David Strickler, sometimes William

1130
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,560
 Strickler.

1131
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,880
 Different newspaper articles have different names.

1132
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,400
 But he definitely was making them around 1904, 1905.

1133
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,800
 We have evidence that he was buying these banana-shaped glass

1134
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,560
 things.

1135
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,960
 I wonder if we know stuff because Strickler is really

1136
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,800
 celebrated there.

1137
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,160
 Oh, yeah.

1138
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,000
 Why do we not know his first name?

1139
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,120
 I think we probably do.

1140
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,800
 And I think one person made a mistake.

1141
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,160
 And then that mistake has kind of gone through because--

1142
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,720
 But yeah, if you look, in fact, even like newspaper

1143
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,520
 articles relatively close to the time,

1144
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,640
 some of them call him William and some of them call him David,

1145
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,320
 it's so weird.

1146
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:36,040
 So are they split over what his first name is?

1147
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,520
 Yeah, so I read that basically he'd

1148
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,280
 made a special boat-shaped dish.

1149
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,040
 He commissioned these glass-shaped dishes.

1150
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,600
 But that no one has actually got a receipt

1151
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,760
 that that hasn't turned up.

1152
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,760
 But maybe I'm sure there are contemporary reports.

1153
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,560
 I know for a fact that they were being

1154
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,360
 sold close by in 1905.

1155
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,120
 Oh, OK.

1156
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:57,440
 So I found some newspaper adverts, one in Harrisburg,

1157
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,480
 Pennsylvania, which is fairly close to Littrow,

1158
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,920
 was about 100 miles away.

1159
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,760
 They were selling them in 1906, which was a year before they

1160
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,520
 were supposedly invented in Wilmington.

1161
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,120
 There was a-- yeah, some from 1904, 1905, 1906.

1162
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,480
 You can see they start popping up in newspapers

1163
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,400
 as being advertised.

1164
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,360
 Is it not possible?

1165
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,200
 You know, with all great scientific discoveries,

1166
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,720
 or a lot of them, society as a whole

1167
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,360
 has progressed to a certain place,

1168
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:25,160
 where it's inevitable that individuals come up

1169
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,040
 with things simultaneously, you know?

1170
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,760
 And they'll be on the other side of the world.

1171
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,960
 And is it possible that--

1172
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,040
 This is morphic resonance.

1173
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,440
 This is all cheap rolling across cattle grids

1174
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,240
 around the planet.

1175
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,560
 So like the Dennis the Menace thing of when they were

1176
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,560
 individually invented into--

1177
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,560
 It's not like that at all.

1178
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,440
 This is the same banana pudding that we're talking about.

1179
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,440
 It is kind of the same.

1180
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,400
 So the Dennis the Menace thing, there

1181
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,600
 had recently been a song called Dennis the Menace.

1182
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,640
 It was like a music whole song.

1183
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,720
 And kind of people came up with these characters,

1184
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,640
 probably influenced by that.

1185
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,920
 In America, in the late 19th century,

1186
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,800
 they started importing bananas from different countries,

1187
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,920
 and they started selling them.

1188
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,080
 So that was really big.

1189
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,560
 They'd also started making ice cream more regularly,

1190
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,040
 because they had much better ways of making ice cream.

1191
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,480
 So ice cream was new.

1192
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,880
 Bananas was new.

1193
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,680
 It was the time for banana splits to be invented.

1194
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:15,000
 It's not rocket science, just merging them together.

1195
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,600
 Apology accepted, Izzy.

1196
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,000
 Well, I don't think I've ever had a banana split.

1197
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,480
 Have you not?

1198
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,880
 No, I've never had one.

1199
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,880
 No.

1200
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,680
 You're not missing out.

1201
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,480
 I'd never choose one.

1202
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,960
 It's one of the least good puddings.

1203
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,120
 Yeah, but as a child, you must have been given them,

1204
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,760
 because it's a way to make you eat bananas.

1205
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,400
 I read that in the UK they're known as the banana longboat,

1206
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,320
 which I like as well.

1207
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:34,720
 But apparently--

1208
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,520
 I've never heard that.

1209
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,120
 Me neither.

1210
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:40,640
 I think it was only in Wimpy, in the restaurant chain Wimpy.

1211
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,600
 There was one other thing that I mentioned earlier.

1212
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,320
 The Soda Fountain magazine reckoned

1213
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:48,280
 that the banana split was invented in Boston.

1214
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,920
 There was an ice cream convention in 1905,

1215
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,680
 and there was a guy called Stinson Thomas,

1216
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,800
 who supposedly invented it.

1217
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,720
 But Boston has since ceded its title to this place

1218
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,760
 in Pennsylvania.

1219
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,680
 Very noble of Boston.

1220
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,320
 There was even a claim I read that it was invented by someone

1221
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:11,080
 called Letty Lally in 1904.

1222
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,560
 I read this is a claim that she'd invented the banana split,

1223
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,600
 and people were claiming this back in the '50s.

1224
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,320
 But historians have since concluded--

1225
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,520
 so don't panic at Wilmington and Trobe--

1226
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,520
 that she actually invented the banana Royale, which

1227
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,280
 I was not familiar with, but it's like a crap banana split

1228
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,920
 where you chop the banana the wrong way.

1229
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,040
 You chop the banana across the waist

1230
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,560
 rather than dissecting it top to bottom.

1231
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,320
 But multiple times, like waist, neck, knees.

1232
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,280
 And do you put ice cream in it still?

1233
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,360
 Yeah, yeah, and you put ice cream.

1234
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,880
 Otherwise, it's just a chopped banana.

1235
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,040
 It seems pointless, right?

1236
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,880
 Yeah, just seems mad.

1237
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,960
 I tell you what, we love inventing words.

1238
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,080
 I know, but you're not going to be in a restaurant going,

1239
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,200
 I see banana split on the menu.

1240
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,200
 Do you do banana Royale?

1241
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,320
 I'm sorry, the chef can't do it.

1242
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,800
 We don't have the crockery for it.

1243
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,080
 I'm so sorry.

1244
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,920
 Reminds me of one.

1245
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,240
 So that could be the case if your bananas

1246
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,920
 come ready split, couldn't it?

1247
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,120
 Do you know what I mean?

1248
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,640
 So I used to work in a restaurant,

1249
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,960
 and we used to have scrambled eggs that came in a carton.

1250
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,400
 And so we would make scrambled eggs in the morning,

1251
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,640
 because you didn't have to scramble them yourself.

1252
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,000
 They came ready scrambled.

1253
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,640
 But then people would come in and say,

1254
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,920
 can I have a bile egg instead?

1255
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,920
 And you'd have to say, we don't have any eggs.

1256
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:22,280
 And they're like, well, what's this in front of you?

1257
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,920
 That's so funny.

1258
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,240
 Here's another variant of it.

1259
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,960
 Have you heard of the human banana split?

1260
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,120
 Oh, disgusting.

1261
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,360
 You cut a human in half.

1262
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,000
 That's correct.

1263
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,440
 Oh, I know what you're doing here.

1264
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,000
 What?

1265
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,680
 Is it the fact that we share 60% of our DNA with bananas?

1266
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:39,280
 No, you've made a huge reach from the fact

1267
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,200
 that I make huge reaches all the time.

1268
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,480
 But that makes us a literal banana split, doesn't it?

1269
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,760
 No, it doesn't.

1270
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,880
 Doesn't that?

1271
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:49,480
 Not unless you were to clone a human and a banana together.

1272
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:52,240
 That was the original draft of Jeff Goldblum's The Fly.

1273
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,320
 A banana gets thrown into the machine at the last minute,

1274
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,360
 and he comes out in a banana costume.

1275
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:00,600
 No, this is-- it's a practice more than a dessert.

1276
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,680
 It's where some people throw bananas at you,

1277
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,000
 and then other people pour whipped cream and chocolate over you.

1278
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:05,840
 And it's kind of a--

1279
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,840
 Is it a sex thing?

1280
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,840
 No, not at all.

1281
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,400
 Not at all.

1282
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,720
 It's more of a prank than a--

1283
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,440
 I've only found evidence of it happening twice.

1284
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,680
 It feels like an only fans kind of thing, doesn't it?

1285
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:19,800
 I'm sure it will be within half an hour of the show going out.

1286
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:24,800
 We'll have hundreds of thousands of people watching.

1287
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,560
 Once it happened to some guy who was raising money for charity,

1288
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:30,040
 they sort of said, I'll send the videos of your human banana

1289
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,240
 split being made, and another time it was Gordon Ramsay

1290
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,880
 having to-- having to him.

1291
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,400
 It's not-- so it's not like a franchise yet, is it?

1292
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,720
 It hasn't become a universally known--

1293
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,400
 It's not as popular as the banana split.

1294
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,680
 No, no, I don't think it will be.

1295
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,520
 So this-- I think the reason they came about

1296
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,680
 was really because of the popularity of soda fountains.

1297
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,880
 Right, which is such an American thing

1298
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:52,960
 that we don't really have.

1299
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,440
 And they were basically there because people

1300
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,280
 would go to the drug store, and they wanted to cure

1301
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,560
 stuff that they had.

1302
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:03,000
 And people believed at the time that carbonated water--

1303
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
 That's got to go.

1304
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,480
 Yeah, I'm just slipping in and out.

1305
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,960
 I'm slipping in and out.

1306
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,800
 And these from Guatemala, and it's from Boston.

1307
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,520
 I've got some Bostonian blood.

1308
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,080
 People would go to the pharmacy, and they

1309
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:19,040
 had these fountains, which would give them fizzy water, which

1310
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,160
 people thought was very curative at the time.

1311
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,400
 Like Coca-Cola was a curative thing, wasn't it?

1312
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,440
 Yeah, yeah, so they'd mix it up by giving them flavors,

1313
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,040
 and the Coca-Cola and stuff.

1314
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:31,160
 And then they'd start adding stuff to these

1315
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,360
 to make them more appealing.

1316
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,800
 And that's where the Sundays came about,

1317
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,560
 and that's where the banana split came about.

1318
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,400
 And that's why Strickler was a pharmacist,

1319
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,280
 because he worked in a pharmacy.

1320
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,600
 And he thought, how do I get more people to my soda fountains?

1321
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,800
 He was a jerk, wasn't he?

1322
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,840
 He was a jerk.

1323
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:46,840
 Yeah, a soda jerk.

1324
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,600
 That's what they called them, soda jerks.

1325
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,080
 Yeah.

1326
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:52,080
 Apparently, it was a pun on the word "clurk."

1327
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,080
 Clark, clerk.

1328
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:58,400
 So someone who works in a pharmacy might be a clerk.

1329
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:03,520
 And then your guy, who was jerking down the handle

1330
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,080
 to make the ice cream, he would be jerking that down,

1331
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,600
 so he would be a soda jerk.

1332
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,800
 Yeah, I really-- I didn't know anything

1333
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,360
 about soda fountains and soda jerks.

1334
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,560
 We've seen them in a couple of films and things like this.

1335
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,560
 But there are so many--

1336
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:18,360
 yeah, Pepsi and Coca-Cola were the next stage,

1337
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,040
 where you got pre-made syrup.

1338
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,280
 Because before that, everyone had their own recipes,

1339
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,840
 and individual soda jerks would have their own things.

1340
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:29,040
 Cocaine was legal in these until about 1914.

1341
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,560
 Yeah, often you just drop some cocaine in with your soda.

1342
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,760
 A small amount, obviously.

1343
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,600
 It's like cocktails, weren't they, really?

1344
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,240
 Yeah.

1345
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,160
 Bit like that.

1346
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,400
 And that was a kind of golden age of crazy different recipes

1347
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:43,840
 before the more uniform, really popular big drinks came in.

1348
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:44,800
 But OK, I've got a few--

1349
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,440
 It's like the Cambrian explosion of ice cream.

1350
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,400
 Yeah.

1351
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,160
 Yeah, on a slightly smaller time frame.

1352
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,160
 That's the thing which happened in the Tree of Life, isn't it?

1353
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,080
 I'm only vaguely aware of the Cambrian explosion.

1354
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,720
 I just know a lot of animals came with lots of weird arms

1355
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,000
 coming off their heads and stuff.

1356
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,120
 It was exactly like that.

1357
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,720
 OK, I wanted to tell you a few of the--

1358
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,600
 What animals have arms coming off their heads?

1359
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,920
 Unsuccessful ones.

1360
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,840
 OK, OK, the ones that died out.

1361
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:11,120
 Well, do you want to hear a few that have died out of the ice creams?

1362
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:14,200
 These are ice creams and ice creamy drinks.

1363
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:17,800
 So the black cow was--

1364
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,000
 Milk.

1365
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:19,720
 Ice cream.

1366
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:20,800
 I'll give you that.

1367
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:21,760
 Guinness.

1368
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,280
 Chocolate syrup and root beer.

1369
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,080
 Pretty close.

1370
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:24,680
 Yeah.

1371
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,000
 That sounds good.

1372
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,600
 Twist it, choke it, and make it cackle.

1373
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:32,440
 Well, I'd rather do it after the show.

1374
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:35,400
 Twist it, choke it, and make it cackle.

1375
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:39,200
 You had to kill your own chicken, and then they'd put that in.

1376
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:43,720
 Well, you had to put an egg in it, so kind of close.

1377
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:46,040
 OK, but they were also, for the winter, they were hot sodas.

1378
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,840
 Because obviously, selling cold, icy sodas

1379
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,200
 is very unpopular in the wintertime.

1380
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,440
 So they invented a load of hot drinks

1381
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,760
 to go with these machines.

1382
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,120
 So there was hot eggnog, hot mint juleps,

1383
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,520
 and if you guys get any of the ingredients of this,

1384
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:01,760
 I'll give you a big smile and base.

1385
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,800
 You almost went for 1,000 points.

1386
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,720
 But it's like, oh, I can't give them 1,000 imaginary points.

1387
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:07,720
 That would be terrible.

1388
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:08,200
 Oh, points?

1389
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,880
 I thought pounds, I was hearing pounds.

1390
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,200
 I wavered between points of pounds

1391
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,520
 and thought I don't want to give either away.

1392
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,160
 The reeking smash.

1393
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:16,840
 Reeking smash.

1394
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:17,560
 What are the ingredients for?

1395
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:18,480
 Spinach.

1396
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,000
 No.

1397
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,280
 Reek, so, kimchi.

1398
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,560
 Oh, classic.

1399
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,960
 1950s American soda joking.

1400
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,800
 Korean import export.

1401
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,560
 OK, the reeking smash.

1402
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,720
 This sounds like the worst drink I could possibly imagine.

1403
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,880
 Water, some kind of water.

1404
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,480
 I'm not going to give you that, actually.

1405
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,480
 Clam juice, cream and ginger.

1406
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:42,560
 Clam juice, cream and ginger.

1407
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,480
 So close with cinnamon.

1408
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,400
 It just sounds absolutely frank.

1409
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,640
 Yeah, that's not a good combination.

1410
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,080
 So, it's so weird to think why Coca-Cola took off

1411
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,200
 in an environment where you could get a nice reeking smash.

1412
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:57,400
 Imagine if we were all drinking reeking smash now.

1413
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:00,280
 Just very quickly, I was looking into other kinds

1414
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,840
 of banana splits.

1415
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:04,520
 And one that I'd not actually ever heard of

1416
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:07,680
 was a Hannah Barbera cartoon.

1417
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,640
 The banana splits, you haven't heard of.

1418
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:12,560
 Yeah, it kind of like passed me by.

1419
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:15,360
 And it didn't last too long.

1420
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,200
 It was 1968 to 1970.

1421
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,200
 There was a syndication that went on a bit later.

1422
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,320
 Can I just say also, I wasn't alive in those years.

1423
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,280
 They did repeat it quite a bit.

1424
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:26,960
 Yeah, it was syndicated from '70 to '82,

1425
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,120
 but obviously it's been on TV ever since.

1426
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,680
 And who knows in this country when.

1427
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,200
 But it was cancelled.

1428
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:36,400
 So, they made a movie in 2019, the banana splits movie.

1429
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,600
 And it's amazing because this was a kids TV show.

1430
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,840
 The plotline of this movie is that the banana splits

1431
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:45,840
 are in studio and they're recording their show

1432
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,960
 where they discovered they were about to be cancelled.

1433
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:50,000
 The movie is about the murder spree

1434
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,920
 that the banana splits go on,

1435
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,160
 killing everyone inside the studio

1436
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,320
 because they're furious about the upcoming cancellation.

1437
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,880
 Are they actually banana splits?

1438
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,440
 'Cause I don't know how they would murder anyone.

1439
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,680
 They were like huge sort of bear, were they bears?

1440
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,640
 Yeah, they were like big animals.

1441
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,080
 Big animals, exactly.

1442
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:07,000
 You played in a band.

1443
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,600
 It sounds like Alpha Papa.

1444
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:11,840
 Yeah, it does sound like that, which is an amazingly good film.

1445
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,000
 It is, as I've seen that.

1446
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,920
 But yeah, it was rated R, I believe.

1447
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:17,120
 And this is, so a lot of people were furious

1448
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:19,240
 because their childhood classic had come back

1449
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:21,240
 and they couldn't take their kids to it.

1450
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:22,240
 Turn it to scream.

1451
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,840
 Yeah, exactly.

1452
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:27,160
 You know when Bob Barley was accused of plagiarizing that?

1453
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:28,000
 That TV show?

1454
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,720
 Yeah, he was accused of plagiarizing it for Buffalo Soldier.

1455
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,640
 And it's the bit that in the theme tune that says

1456
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:40,720
 Tralalala, Tralalala, Tralalala.

1457
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,200
 Oh my days.

1458
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,200
 That's the banana splits.

1459
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,360
 I don't know anything about.

1460
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,520
 Who do you say, Bob Dylan?

1461
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:46,680
 Bob Barley.

1462
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:48,320
 I don't know any Bob Barley songs.

1463
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:52,080
 Buffalo Soldier, well, obviously it's exactly the same tune.

1464
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,640
 I mean, it's a very simple tune

1465
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,600
 and it's almost certainly didn't plagiarize it

1466
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,320
 and he has been, well, people who represent him

1467
00:48:58,320 --> 00:48:59,480
 have been asked about it.

1468
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:01,640
 I mean, that sounded bang on, I gotta say.

1469
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:04,320
 I'm on the side of the banana splits on this one.

1470
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:08,960
 Well, a friend of Bob said he was a very serious man

1471
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,680
 and I doubt very much he had come across something like

1472
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:12,680
 a banana splits.

1473
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:14,520
 Well, a friend of Snorky from the banana splits said

1474
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:17,360
 that bastard stole our song.

1475
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,280
 I've got one final thing about Soda Fountains

1476
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,840
 and who killed the Soda Fountain, right?

1477
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:24,400
 So this is from a piece in the New York Times

1478
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,280
 talking about why this declined, you know,

1479
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,120
 because they were huge.

1480
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,600
 They were where people socialized,

1481
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:29,440
 they were where people hung out,

1482
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,240
 they were big business as well.

1483
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,400
 So there's a theory.

1484
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,840
 It was whoever invented the driving restaurant,

1485
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,440
 which then was the next huge thing.

1486
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,280
 There's a theory.

1487
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:42,600
 It was F.D. Roosevelt who repealed prohibition.

1488
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:43,520
 There's another theory.

1489
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,520
 And this is all from the New York Times piece about it.

1490
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,000
 There's a guy called William Painter.

1491
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,600
 Okay, William Painter was the person who patented

1492
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:54,200
 the crimped metal bottle cap.

1493
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,760
 - Oh, because I thought Willie Painter was the guy

1494
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:59,040
 who invented the camouflage gun.

1495
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,280
 (laughing)

1496
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:05,080
 (laughing)

1497
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:05,920
 Very good.

1498
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,760
 - As you would say.

1499
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:09,960
 - What's the word, sorry, what is that?

1500
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,240
 - You know the crimped metal bottle cap,

1501
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,360
 like on a glass bottle of Coke.

1502
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,400
 That bottle cap is metal,

1503
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:14,920
 but it's also got this kind of, you know,

1504
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,520
 like ruffles around the edge of the crimps.

1505
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:19,000
 So that made it possible to standardize drinks.

1506
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:19,840
 And he actually invented that

1507
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,480
 in around the like the early,

1508
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:22,480
 the first decade of the 20th century.

1509
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:25,520
 - And it meant that you could buy a thousand of them

1510
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,520
 and keep them in a warehouse.

1511
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:27,360
 - Exactly.

1512
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,840
 - Each time someone making a new one.

1513
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:29,680
 - Exactly, yeah.

1514
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:30,520
 - Interesting.

1515
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,480
 - The reason I mentioned this guy, William Painter,

1516
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,600
 is because I thought I'd try and find out

1517
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,520
 other stuff about his life and work.

1518
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:36,840
 He invented a load of different things,

1519
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:39,440
 including, and I can find no more details about this,

1520
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,440
 an ejector seat for trains.

1521
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,200
 (laughing)

1522
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,040
 - Brilliant.

1523
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:47,880
 - And it doesn't say whether it's for the driver

1524
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,160
 or for the passengers.

1525
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,120
 - Must be the driver.

1526
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:53,560
 - Every single passenger had,

1527
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:56,440
 you see them flying into the air, 300 people.

1528
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:59,600
 One last thing.

1529
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:00,840
 - Do you know that Liz Truss's mum

1530
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:03,320
 used to regularly dress up as a banana?

1531
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:04,880
 (laughing)

1532
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:05,720
 - No.

1533
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,680
 - Sorry, Amanda's a hoot, Liz Truss is.

1534
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,000
 - Yes, sorry.

1535
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,800
 For any international or British listeners,

1536
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:14,000
 Liz Truss was the person who was momentarily

1537
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,160
 prime minister of the country a very short while ago.

1538
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,120
 - And she's the second most successful member

1539
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:21,640
 of her family by the sound of the chains.

1540
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:22,980
 - Wow.

1541
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:24,760
 - This actually came out in a book

1542
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:25,680
 that was famously released,

1543
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,360
 a book that's called Out of the Blue.

1544
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:29,880
 Well, it was called Out of the Blue,

1545
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,200
 the inside story of Liz Truss

1546
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,680
 and her explosive rise to power.

1547
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:35,880
 And it had to be re-titled that book Out of the Blue,

1548
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,640
 the inside story of the unexpected rise

1549
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,280
 and rapid fall of Liz Truss.

1550
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:44,560
 But yeah, her mum was a big campaigner for various things.

1551
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,560
 So she moved to Eastern Europe in the 1970s

1552
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:49,080
 to try out life under communism, for instance.

1553
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:49,920
 Yeah.

1554
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,800
 And she wanted to promote fair trade in leads

1555
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,560
 in the 1970s and she did this

1556
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:57,440
 by making herself a bright yellow banana costume.

1557
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,560
 And wandering around in it.

1558
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:00,400
 - Wow.

1559
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,520
 - And Liz Truss would say she'd go into the supermarket

1560
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,000
 and the kids would be like,

1561
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:04,840
 - She's that amazing.

1562
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,160
 - So her mum just put on her again.

1563
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,000
 - Why did Liz Truss not bring this up?

1564
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,320
 - If she brought that up, yeah, I would be more.

1565
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:10,080
 - 'Cause she kept saying she was from leads,

1566
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:12,380
 she couldn't stop saying she went to school in leads.

1567
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:14,200
 I think I'd be saying my mum used to dress as a man.

1568
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:15,040
 - Do you think you would?

1569
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,120
 I think that's really on the cusp of is it gonna work

1570
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,360
 or is it gonna ruin me?

1571
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:22,400
 - I suppose the Tory voters are not gonna love the idea

1572
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,640
 that she was going to live on the communist government

1573
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:26,920
 in Eastern Europe.

1574
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,360
 - You could leave out that part.

1575
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:29,860
 - Or entrusted in fair trade.

1576
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:34,040
 - Liz Truss, she admired Margaret Thatcher, didn't she?

1577
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:36,480
 Thatcher used to work in ice cream.

1578
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,680
 So if her mum got together with Thatcher,

1579
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:39,720
 we could have had a banana split.

1580
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:40,640
 - A human banana split?

1581
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:41,980
 - Yes.

1582
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:42,820
 - Oh my God.

1583
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:45,400
 (upbeat music)

1584
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:49,440
 - Okay, that's it, that is all of our facts.

00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,800
