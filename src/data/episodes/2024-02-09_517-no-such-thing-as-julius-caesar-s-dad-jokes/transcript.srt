00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:17,040
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,720
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

4
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,360
 coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

5
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,040
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,600
 with Anna Tyshensky, James Harkin, and Andrew Hunter Murray,

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,720
 and once again, we have gathered around the microphones

8
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,520
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,720
 and in no particular order, here we go.

10
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,280
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy.

11
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,560
 My fact is that thousands of soldiers who died

12
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,720
 at Waterloo were turned into sugar.

13
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,200
 - Incredible.

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,360
 - It's a horrible fact about a horrible battle.

15
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,800
 - Wow. - It's incredible.

16
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,160
 - It's really bad. - I'm mad this one.

17
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,620
 - Yeah, how do you turn a person into sugar?

18
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,040
 That seems very unlikely.

19
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,200
 - Well, firstly-- - I'll ask you for a friend.

20
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,200
 - You have to lure them to Waterloo in 1815, kill them.

21
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,320
 - Oh, so I have to be French?

22
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,560
 - Well, oh, I'm so glad we got onto this already.

23
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,960
 There are so many nationalities who fought at Waterloo.

24
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,800
 - Oh yeah.

25
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,680
 - Actually, most of the English army was German.

26
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,240
 - Isn't that nice? - Yeah, I didn't realize that.

27
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,680
 - Two thirds were German speaking as a first language,

28
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,120
 lots of Dutch soldiers as well.

29
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,520
 - Belgian, yeah, they were just brought in, weren't they?

30
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,760
 Sort of, we don't have enough, can you fight?

31
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,880
 - If you're listening to this in Europe,

32
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,560
 probably your nationality was represented at Waterloo

33
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,560
 in some capacity or another.

34
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,960
 - Yeah, yeah. - And more than the Brits,

35
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,800
 who constituted about 12% of the British led army.

36
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,280
 - Oh, it was about a third, it was about a third.

37
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,400
 - Estimates may vary.

38
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,640
 - Oh, they do, they vary-- - I think at the lower end,

39
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,440
 we think maybe only, you know.

40
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,440
 - So what are we saying in case you don't like

41
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,720
 British sugar, don't worry.

42
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,360
 There is multinational sugar in it.

43
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,560
 - Well, it was, they set up a sugar factory

44
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,800
 pretty much on the battlefield.

45
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,200
 I mean, it was all a bit--

46
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,680
 - Can I refer you to my earlier question?

47
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,200
 - How does one turn a human into some sugar?

48
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,040
 - All right, thank you.

49
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,640
 - Because sugar is a thing that grows in the ground

50
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,400
 in sugar beet or sugar cane, and then you harvest it,

51
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,840
 and there are no humans involved.

52
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,320
 - That's true, that's true.

53
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,360
 But what you do need to do is filter sugar syrup

54
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,960
 when you're making the sugar.

55
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,320
 So this was something, basically,

56
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,800
 very, very few bodies have been found

57
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,480
 on the battlefield at Waterloo.

58
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,080
 Like, suspiciously few.

59
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,120
 - Isn't it just, yeah. - Two full skeletons,

60
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,280
 of 20,000 of them.

61
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:29,280
 - Are we sure it wasn't just Napoleon and Wellington?

62
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,840
 Just coming at it.

63
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,080
 - And they just really over-engaged,

64
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,440
 like, whoever won really told the much bigger lie

65
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,760
 about what had happened there.

66
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,480
 - It's the greatest prank in history.

67
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,360
 Let's really pull the wool over those 21st century idiots eyes.

68
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,560
 - No, so there were lots of graves,

69
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,400
 and there were huge graves,

70
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,600
 but only a few bones have been found.

71
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,680
 Like, as you say, two full skeletons,

72
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,520
 they found three legs relatively recently,

73
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,400
 as well recently, which was near one of the hospitals.

74
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,520
 So those were probably amputated legs on the day.

75
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,680
 - Oh, right, so it's not that it was Napoleon versus Wellington,

76
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,080
 and one of them had three legs.

77
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,320
 - Yeah, that's what I was hoping.

78
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,400
 One of the skeletons was a tripod.

79
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,920
 - But you're right, there should have been huge numbers

80
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,200
 of dead people, or bodies in the ground.

81
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,160
 And the theory is, and this is quite a recent theory

82
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,560
 that's been developed, is that in the aftermath of the battle,

83
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,760
 the local residents, or the sort of local peasants,

84
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,560
 they dug up the corpses, and they sold the bones

85
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,960
 to people working in the sugar beet industry,

86
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,600
 because the bones were really valuable at the time,

87
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,080
 and normally animal bones were used.

88
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,080
 You would cook the bones.

89
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,200
 That made a powder called noir animal,

90
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,000
 which you could use to filter the sugar syrup

91
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,600
 and make lovely, clean sugar.

92
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,440
 So these days, noir animal is still used,

93
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,960
 but animal bones, and also not in sugar,

94
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,480
 it's used for other products and things.

95
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,000
 So sugar these days hasn't been in any bones.

96
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,360
 - Sugar is vegan.

97
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,040
 - Don't worry, yeah, vegetarians worldwide.

98
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,880
 - Sugar is vegan.

99
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,520
 But the theory is that local peasants

100
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,360
 just dug up the bodies and used the bones

101
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,320
 for this industry, and it's a pretty

102
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,160
 compelling theory at the moment.

103
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,320
 - 'Cause we've known for ages

104
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,720
 that they took the teeth out of people, didn't they?

105
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,560
 - Yeah.

106
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,840
 - And they used them for false teeth,

107
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,000
 and so false teeth were known as waterloo teeth.

108
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,600
 - Yeah, waterloo ivory. - For hundreds of years.

109
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,440
 - Such a, yeah, it's so dark.

110
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,280
 - Very macabre, yeah.

111
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,960
 - And they did write about the sugar thing

112
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,360
 back in the 1800s, or it was a German newspaper

113
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,280
 that actually wrote, you should be using honey to sweeten food

114
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,040
 and avoid risk of having your great-grandfather's atoms

115
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,200
 dissolved in your coffee one fine morning.

116
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,040
 - Wow.

117
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,960
 - I like that, I quite like that idea

118
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,760
 of recycling your grandparents into your body.

119
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,960
 - Absolutely, yeah, yeah.

120
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,760
 - And in 1822, there was an article in The Observer

121
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,080
 that said, "It is now ascertained beyond the doubt

122
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,880
 by actual experiments on an extensive scale

123
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,480
 that a dead soldier is a most valuable article of commerce."

124
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,680
 And they were talking about the fact

125
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,360
 that they were ground up and used as fertilizer.

126
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,320
 - Yes, they were, weren't they?

127
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,040
 They covered the fields of Europe.

128
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,720
 - I suppose, in a way, it's recycling.

129
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,000
 - Yeah, good on them. - Isn't it?

130
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,440
 - Like, once you're dead, like, do you really care?

131
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,440
 - Exactly.

132
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,400
 - A controversial question.

133
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,120
 - Wow, it's not that controversial.

134
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,240
 Once you're dead, I'm pretty sure you don't care.

135
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,960
 Unless you're a ghost, I suppose.

136
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,800
 - A woman does one care.

137
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,640
 Some people care what happens to, you know, the dead.

138
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,040
 - There was a single-- - Uncontroversial.

139
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,960
 - There was a single, The Bone Rush.

140
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,400
 And it was partly because, it was actually partly

141
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,600
 because of Britain, because Britain blockaded sugar.

142
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,040
 Right, 'cause most sugar came from places

143
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,280
 like the West Indies, which were British colonies

144
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,720
 at the time, and Britain had blockaded that,

145
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,360
 so not much sugar could get to Europe.

146
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,760
 So Europe set up a big sugar beet industry

147
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,960
 that was a kind of way of making sugar

148
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,680
 that didn't rely on shipping.

149
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,400
 So that, and then that needed the bones.

150
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,640
 So, in a sense-- - So thank God for Waterloo.

151
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,480
 - In a sense, it's our fault.

152
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,560
 - Yeah, yeah. - In a sense.

153
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,360
 - In a sense. - In a sense.

154
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,080
 Waterloo, I can't believe,

155
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,000
 I can't believe we've hardly talked about Waterloo before.

156
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,960
 I'm so excited.

157
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,560
 I can't believe we're only gonna do one section on it.

158
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,960
 Like, the rest is history, guys.

159
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,600
 They would get eight episodes out of the Battle of Waterloo.

160
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,080
 And we have to cram it into 15 minutes.

161
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,920
 It's not fair.

162
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,000
 - I think you're optimistic about 15 minutes,

163
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 I'll be honest. - Yeah.

164
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,560
 - I'm looking at some of the other facts coming up,

165
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,000
 and I reckon they might be a bit longer.

166
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,560
 - Oh no, it's so interesting. - You're allowed one fact, Andy.

167
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,040
 - No, we've gotta go through the whole--

168
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,880
 - What's your fave?

169
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,320
 What's your fave Waterloo fact?

170
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,160
 Apart from the headline, obviously, which--

171
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,920
 - Oh, man. - My definition is.

172
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,240
 - I'm quite interested in the cavalry charges and stuff,

173
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,520
 and the farmhouse at the centre of it all,

174
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,360
 and all that.

175
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,680
 And the stuff that doesn't make very good stuff for our show,

176
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,960
 I suppose. - You have brought a lot of

177
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,720
 toy soldiers onto the table today.

178
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,080
 (laughing)

179
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,360
 - Well, there is.

180
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,640
 Have you heard of the Siborn model?

181
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,480
 - No. - No.

182
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,320
 - This is so cool.

183
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,120
 This is like, I tried to stick to mostly the aftermath

184
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,120
 of the battle, rather than in-depth troop movements.

185
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,680
 You're welcome.

186
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,160
 But there was a captain called William Siborn,

187
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,680
 who made a huge model of the Battle of Waterloo,

188
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,440
 15 years after it had happened.

189
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,960
 And he spent eight weeks on the battlefield itself,

190
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,800
 just researching.

191
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,680
 He took seven years to make it.

192
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,080
 He made, well, he certainly put 80,000 model soldiers

193
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,160
 on this 400-square-foot model.

194
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,000
 It's massive.

195
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,840
 - In a way, though, what we've got is one guy going

196
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,000
 to the battlefield saying, "Okay, I need to know

197
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,800
 where everyone was so I can make the model."

198
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,280
 But at the same time, all of the locals are coming in,

199
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,760
 moving all the bodies around and taking all the bodies

200
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,600
 and stuff.

201
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,440
 That must have been really awkward.

202
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,280
 - Yeah, I'm sure he was very--

203
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,240
 And actually, 15 years afterwards was around the time

204
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,320
 they were doing the sugar harvesting.

205
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,680
 And he interviewed dozens of soldiers saying,

206
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,600
 "Where were you at 7 p.m. on the 18th of June, 1815?"

207
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,280
 But he really went into detail.

208
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,360
 And then he assumed the government was gonna pay for it

209
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,040
 'cause it was his life's work.

210
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,000
 And the government kind of had said we'll pay for it,

211
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,360
 but kind of didn't.

212
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,320
 And Wellington was annoyed 'cause the model had

213
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,320
 too many Prussians is the theory.

214
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:33,680
 So he died poor and broke just with this 400-square-foot model

215
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,720
 of the Battle of Waterloo at 7 p.m.

216
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,560
 - Do we still have it?

217
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,080
 - It's in the National Army Museum now,

218
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,080
 which is in Chelsea.

219
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,320
 So it does still exist.

220
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,160
 Yeah, yeah.

221
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,000
 - It's incredible.

222
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,800
 - It's awesome, but it kind of ruined his life.

223
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,840
 - Yeah, wow.

224
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,120
 - We should probably say Waterloo happened

225
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,160
 because Napoleon had been dealt with,

226
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,640
 defeated by the combined Allied powers,

227
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,560
 and he'd been sent away to Elba,

228
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,640
 where he was given, which is a little island off Italy,

229
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,080
 where he was given command of the island.

230
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,880
 He was also given a small army and navy.

231
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,440
 What are you thinking?

232
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,400
 This is the best military commander in history.

233
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,880
 He's got a small army and navy.

234
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,720
 He can't possibly--

235
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,280
 - Who gave that to him, the British?

236
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,360
 - I don't, I think it was like a sort of Allied decision.

237
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,480
 Like they just said, we'll just, it's fine.

238
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,400
 He'll step down.

239
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,760
 He won't want to come back.

240
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,520
 - What a weird, like a desert island disk luxury island.

241
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,720
 - Elba is not that far away.

242
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,680
 That's the crazy thing.

243
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,520
 Like it's quite close.

244
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,360
 I've been there.

245
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,400
 It's quite close to Italy.

246
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,720
 It's really easy to get back.

247
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,680
 So obviously he does a few, like he improves Elba a bit,

248
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,960
 just sort of fixes it in various ways.

249
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,920
 Then he comes back, like straight back,

250
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,240
 but only with a small army.

251
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,560
 - Only with a small army.

252
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,400
 - And then, so this is in 1815.

253
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,960
 It's called the Hundred Days between him,

254
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,200
 like leaving Elba and getting to where he's eventually defeated

255
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,800
 because everyone has suddenly scrambled back into action.

256
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,720
 But, and the Bourbon monarchy has been restored.

257
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,840
 It's Louis the 18th, I think,

258
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,320
 who's been put on the throne of France.

259
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,120
 Slightly embarrassing, obviously.

260
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,240
 He's just sort of sidled back onto the throne.

261
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,560
 And as soon as Napoleon lands in France,

262
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,560
 Louis the 18th sends two big forces led by two marshals

263
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,000
 who like Napoleon's generals were all called marshals.

264
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,840
 Sends two marshals.

265
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,040
 As soon as they meet Napoleon, they change sides.

266
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,960
 Like instantly, he just says, look, it's me.

267
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,480
 It's Napoleon, Bonie's back.

268
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,320
 Let's go. - Come on, guys.

269
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,160
 - And they just change sides.

270
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,320
 And he's in charge of France again.

271
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,520
 And the monarchy flees again.

272
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,880
 And then all of Europe has to wake up and scramble and,

273
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,760
 you know, draw him to Waterloo and try and defeat him.

274
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,520
 - And they're basically led by a duo of Wellington and Blucher.

275
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,200
 And they were really different characters.

276
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,040
 - How are they?

277
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,080
 - So Wellington sounds like a bit of a dick, maybe,

278
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,280
 to hang out with, but really good general.

279
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,800
 So his forces didn't really love him

280
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,840
 because he was quite cold, quite arrogant.

281
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,880
 - The iron duke.

282
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,360
 - The iron duke, yes.

283
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,320
 You're never going to love someone called the iron duke

284
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,720
 go to parties with him.

285
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,640
 Whereas Blucher was more very brave,

286
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,680
 not a good strategist, didn't plan ahead.

287
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,520
 - He was the disco bald duke.

288
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,840
 - Exactly, yes.

289
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:57,600
 So, and he was called Papa Blucher by his men.

290
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,280
 And they loved and trusted him.

291
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,000
 But yeah, Wellington quite cocky, apparently.

292
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,560
 - And the interesting thing about Blucher,

293
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,520
 one of the interesting things is he invented a type of boot.

294
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,360
 Didn't he?

295
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,240
 So just like Wellington did.

296
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,880
 So Wellington had his boot.

297
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,200
 - Hang on, that's not his boot, is it?

298
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,400
 The Wellington boot?

299
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,240
 - It's named after him.

300
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,080
 Yeah, and he was--

301
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,920
 - But he didn't invent it.

302
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,520
 - Well, yeah, I'm sure he wanted--

303
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,920
 - He wanted people to have a special kind of boot

304
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,240
 to go into battle with.

305
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,080
 - Yeah, right, yeah.

306
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,320
 - And it was two boots each.

307
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,160
 - Yeah.

308
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,160
 - One of us had three.

309
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,400
 (all laughing)

310
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,400
 - And he, yeah, he didn't do the designing

311
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,200
 or the making of it or anything like that,

312
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,360
 but it was his idea, I think.

313
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,200
 - Yeah.

314
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,040
 - And there were wellies.

315
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,880
 - Yeah, yeah.

316
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,240
 - They were proper boots.

317
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,880
 - Yeah, it wasn't like a farmer.

318
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,640
 - Yeah, that's what I'm thinking of, but yeah, yeah.

319
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,080
 - Imagine squelching into--

320
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,160
 (all laughing)

321
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,480
 - Or like some shiny ones,

322
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,680
 like with rainbows on like you get in Glastonbury.

323
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,520
 (all laughing)

324
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,720
 - Napoleon actually lost

325
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,840
 'cause he wore his kitten heels on the day of the battle

326
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,440
 and he got stuck in some mud.

327
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,400
 - So he was in Crocs.

328
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,320
 - Blucher had a boot, too.

329
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,760
 - Yeah, so Wellington had his boot,

330
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,760
 but they weren't, that hadn't been invented

331
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,560
 at the Battle of Waterloo, but Blucher's boot had been.

332
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,040
 So the Blucher army went in in Blucher's boots,

333
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,160
 but the Wellington army didn't go out in Wellington boots

334
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,440
 'cause they hadn't been invented.

335
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,400
 - The idea of generals having their kind of their merch.

336
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,240
 - It's a good idea.

337
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,520
 - You can imagine the final speech

338
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,560
 on the morning of the battle.

339
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,080
 And if you put in the offer code Blucher,

340
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,640
 you'll get 10 marks off the price of your first pair.

341
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,720
 (all laughing)

342
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,840
 - But no, it was this huge,

343
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,680
 like it was 200,000 men crammed into about five square miles.

344
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,840
 Like it was a very, very, very deadly battle,

345
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,520
 like lots of casualties, hence all the bodies.

346
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,400
 I think 50,000 were killed or seriously injured.

347
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,720
 It was really sort of bloody.

348
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,480
 - It took place over about four days.

349
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,480
 Waterloo was on the final day

350
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,640
 and there were three small battles leading up

351
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,960
 to the big final confrontation.

352
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,760
 - And not in Waterloo as well, we should say.

353
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,600
 - No, nearby, yeah.

354
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,560
 - It's like with Roswell, with the alien incident.

355
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,400
 - All right.

356
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,480
 - It was because the aliens were brought back to Roswell,

357
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,320
 it's called Roswell.

358
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,160
 - Oh my gosh.

359
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,440
 - This was the information was sent from Waterloo.

360
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,280
 - I thought it was safe from you.

361
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,040
 I thought this fact was, like this is a damn proof fact.

362
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,440
 There's no way he's gonna be able to get onto yesterday.

363
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,800
 - So the tripod came down onto the battlefield.

364
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,680
 That's interesting.

365
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,480
 So that was where his office was.

366
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,840
 - That's where they were stationed, yeah.

367
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,720
 And basically, as it says, it's like the official report

368
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,600
 had the date line and the location on it

369
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,360
 and Waterloo was the location and so forth, yeah.

370
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,200
 - Which was close.

371
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,040
 - It was super close.

372
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,880
 - It was super close.

373
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,760
 - Roswell was right next door to Corona, you know.

374
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,600
 - Corona?

375
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,440
 - That's where, yeah.

376
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,280
 - What?

377
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,240
 - I know, right?

378
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,080
 - Get out.

379
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,040
 - No one else has been pushing this conspiracy

380
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,080
 like I have, so I'm glad we're all aboard.

381
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,560
 - But yes, aliens gave us the Corona virus.

382
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,400
 - Wow.

383
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:39,040
 - This was the end of the Napoleonic War, or was it?

384
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,000
 There was actually another battle afterwards

385
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,440
 which France won in the Napoleonic War.

386
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,280
 So France won the last battle of the Napoleonic War.

387
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,120
 - Get out.

388
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,680
 - The Battle of Wavre.

389
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,400
 And what happened was it was French reinforcements

390
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,160
 coming to Waterloo and they met up with the Prussians

391
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,320
 and there was a big battle, but what they didn't realize

392
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,640
 is the Battle of Waterloo had already finished.

393
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:03,160
 And so Napoleon had lost, but there was another battle

394
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,800
 going on to bring reinforcements.

395
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,160
 France won that.

396
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,440
 Brilliant, let's go.

397
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,400
 Oh, it's finished.

398
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,480
 - Wow, so that is so interesting.

399
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,320
 I didn't know that.

400
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,160
 - Yeah.

401
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,080
 - So technically, if you win the last battle of the war,

402
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,600
 does it mean that you win the whole war?

403
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,200
 - I reckon if it's like winner stays on.

404
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,120
 - It's last goal wins.

405
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,480
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

406
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,520
 - Are we trying to get more Frenchness for this war?

407
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,200
 It's good, isn't it?

408
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,360
 - I'm not counting it.

409
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,120
 - Andy, you've probably got a few more minutes.

410
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,960
 - Stop, stop, stop.

411
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,680
 - I'll never talk about Waterloo ever again.

412
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,880
 - There are a few Joan of Arc types at Waterloo,

413
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,160
 a few women, yes.

414
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,440
 They seem to be mostly on the Prussian side actually.

415
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,360
 There was a woman called Eleanor Prochaska

416
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,280
 and Friederike, I think she called herself Frederick,

417
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,200
 wasn't her actual name, Kruger.

418
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,240
 And they just cut their hair.

419
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,240
 - Freddy Kruger.

420
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,080
 (laughing)

421
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,420
 - Did I not?

422
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,260
 - Oh my God.

423
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,240
 - Wow.

424
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,600
 - Oh my God.

425
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,440
 - Is that real?

426
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,840
 - I'm trying to welcome Dan back into the conversation.

427
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,920
 - Yeah, Freddy Kruger, that was where he got famous.

428
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,080
 - That's so good, 'cause there's also a famous water skier

429
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,920
 called Freddy Kruger.

430
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,760
 - Really?

431
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,600
 - There's this person at the battle.

432
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,480
 We're only one away from an only connect question.

433
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,320
 (laughing)

434
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,160
 - Oh, wow.

435
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,840
 Well, there you go, Victoria Corrin, if you're listening.

436
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,440
 Frederick Kruger cut her hair, went and fought at Waterloo,

437
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,680
 gave herself away, apparently one account said

438
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,060
 when she spoke in a particularly high voice suddenly.

439
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:23,520
 - I'll find you in your dreams, I'm coming for you.

440
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,360
 - My God.

441
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,700
 - Don't go for it.

442
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,280
 (upbeat music)

443
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:33,760
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

444
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,280
 - Okay, my fact this week is that puffer fish

445
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,720
 don't have a functioning stomach,

446
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,680
 so they digest food in their rectum.

447
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,640
 Much like President Garfield.

448
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,040
 - Yes. - Oh, wow.

449
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,000
 - I hadn't made that connection.

450
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 - Or those people on a boat one time, you know,

451
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,400
 who like put food up the bum.

452
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,240
 - Did they?

453
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,080
 - I don't remember this.

454
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,920
 - Do you remember?

455
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,220
 - I don't think Hannah was there.

456
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,880
 - This is one of your yacht parties, isn't it?

457
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,180
 (all laughing)

458
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:02,180
 - It was they put turtle blood up their anus.

459
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:05,740
 - Oh, yes, the shipwrecked family.

460
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,820
 - That's right, the enemas, the total enemas.

461
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,300
 - So we've got President Garfield, those guys,

462
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,640
 the puffer fish were just one away

463
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:15,540
 from an only connect question, if you're listening, Victoria.

464
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,860
 - So do they like President Garfield

465
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,740
 put the food up their bums?

466
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,580
 - No, they do not.

467
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,420
 - Okay.

468
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,540
 - Um, puffer fish get the name because they puff up.

469
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,380
 - Yeah.

470
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,200
 - If they're in danger, they make themselves much bigger

471
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,960
 by sucking in a load of water and just becoming a big ball.

472
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,360
 Now, in order to do that, they've lost their stomach

473
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,200
 because the stomach would get in the way of this skill.

474
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,560
 - You mean evolutionarily or just every time they pop up

475
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,960
 their stomach disappears.

476
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,000
 - Evolutionarily or by design from God.

477
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,800
 They have lost their stomach.

478
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,080
 And so the way that they eat is they get the food

479
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,160
 into their body and they absorb the nutrients

480
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,540
 when it's going down their throat,

481
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,060
 when it's going in their intestines

482
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,740
 and also when it's going into their rectum.

483
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,020
 They have enzymes that break down the food.

484
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,860
 They have, you know, they have an acidic mucus

485
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,900
 all the way down the digestive system.

486
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,360
 But the reason that they don't have a stomach

487
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,660
 is to have a stomach you need to have a sphincter

488
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,160
 on either side and it to be a bag.

489
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,820
 And they don't have that particular thing.

490
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,180
 - They've only got one sphincter.

491
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,500
 - They only have one sphincter.

492
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,540
 - In that system.

493
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,080
 - And then the mouth is the other one.

494
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,100
 - It's really interesting when you think, you know,

495
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,600
 we're all just a bag with two sphincters.

496
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,120
 - We are, really.

497
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,000
 Yeah, we're a Chutira stone.

498
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,560
 As in the mouth comes first and then the anus comes

499
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,600
 and then all the other bits come.

500
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,480
 - And there's the tube stuff.

501
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,320
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

502
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,140
 - There's humbling stuff, isn't it?

503
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,480
 - It is, yeah.

504
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,640
 But they're very, I didn't really, they're awesome.

505
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,480
 I really like puff fish.

506
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,320
 - Puff fish are awesome.

507
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,160
 - Yeah, they're great.

508
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,000
 - That's so cool.

509
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,400
 - They're quite silly, I think.

510
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,320
 - They're very silly.

511
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,920
 - I think as a defense mechanism,

512
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,200
 I think inflating yourself like a balloon rather.

513
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,000
 And I think basically they had to evolve that

514
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,740
 because they're not very good swimmers.

515
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,980
 And so instead they just puff themselves up to this

516
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,260
 too big to eat, like a comedy animal.

517
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:00,180
 - They're the only fish that my daughter can recognize,

518
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,500
 the only species of fish.

519
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,340
 - Oh, really?

520
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,180
 - Oh, wow.

521
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,020
 - That's a fact.

522
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:04,860
 - That's a good fact.

523
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,260
 - As in if you give her a picture of loads of fish,

524
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,660
 she'll recognize that they're fish,

525
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,860
 but if puff fish will go puff a fish.

526
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:10,700
 Pfft.

527
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,760
 - Oh, nice.

528
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,900
 - I used to have a puff a fish as a kid as a pet.

529
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,740
 - No.

530
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,580
 - Yeah.

531
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:16,420
 - Really?

532
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:19,300
 - I was dead, but I was given it in Hong Kong on the--

533
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,380
 - Was it inflated?

534
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,680
 - Yeah, it was.

535
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,840
 It was inflated and a guy had caught it

536
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,880
 and I went, it was a fishing village in Hong Kong

537
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,840
 and he gave it to me.

538
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,680
 It was dead.

539
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,520
 He gave it to me in a bag.

540
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,280
 And I brought it home and I kept it in it.

541
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,800
 We had a fridge for some reason in the hallway

542
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,280
 of the building that we lived in.

543
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,240
 So it was like on the group staircase.

544
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,920
 So I used to go every day and visit my puff a fish

545
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,760
 and just open it and see it.

546
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,600
 - What the hell?

547
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,800
 - Does it count as a pet if it's dead?

548
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,440
 - I think I, because I visited it, that's how I count it.

549
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,960
 I kind of like, yeah.

550
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,640
 And it's stunk out the whole building.

551
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,720
 I didn't recognize 'cause I was so used to the smell

552
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,220
 and no one could locate it

553
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,060
 where the smell was coming from.

554
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,460
 - How could they not locate it if it was in the fridge?

555
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,420
 When someone else opened the fridge, didn't they say?

556
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,340
 - Well, I guess no one did.

557
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,340
 No one opened the fridge.

558
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,180
 - No one ever opened the fridge.

559
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,020
 - 'Cause it was our fridge.

560
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:00,860
 No one touched our fridge.

561
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,700
 - Right, right, right.

562
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,340
 - So how old were you?

563
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,780
 - I was about eight.

564
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,980
 - So how come your parents opened the fridge, right?

565
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,380
 Did your parents never say, you know what, Dan?

566
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,460
 I think it's time you threw out this dead puff a fish.

567
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,300
 - They just didn't tell them.

568
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,300
 So they just didn't know where this thing was coming from.

569
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,140
 - Probably after a while it would have got a load

570
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,540
 of flies and worms and stuff in it, right?

571
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,380
 - It was pretty rotten, yeah.

572
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,980
 - So your parents would have to, after a while go,

573
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,500
 "Dan, I've got bad news.

574
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,240
 Your dead puff a fish is alive."

575
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,340
 (all laughing)

576
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,220
 - Yeah, so true.

577
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,240
 - Anna, William, I've actually got a puff a fish anecdote.

578
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,280
 It's not as good as these twos.

579
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,900
 My daughter can recognize/I used to have a dead pet one.

580
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,220
 But I was at an antiques market a couple of months ago.

581
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:42,720
 And one of the items on sale there was a puff a fish lamp

582
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,240
 where someone had inflated puff a fish

583
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,100
 and then, I don't know how, got a light bulb into it.

584
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,120
 - Oh, one of the sphinxes probably opened together.

585
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,300
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

586
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,340
 But I didn't buy it.

587
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,180
 - Did you not?

588
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,020
 - I don't regret not buying it

589
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,420
 'cause it was a pretty macabre thing.

590
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,260
 - Wow, this is amazing.

591
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,500
 So Andy's got a puff a fish story.

592
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,220
 You've got one, I've got one.

593
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,580
 If we can get Anna one, we'll have another question.

594
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,660
 (all laughing)

595
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,980
 - This is gonna be the most esoteric episode

596
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,500
 of an already quite esoteric show.

597
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,820
 - All right, tune in for my spin-off documentary.

598
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,860
 Anna finds a puff a fish story.

599
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,140
 - Anna and the blowfish.

600
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,420
 Is the blowfish the same as a puff a fish?

601
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,580
 - Yes.

602
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:20,160
 - And they're the same as Fugu.

603
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,420
 - Yeah, I think the Fugu are traditionally dead as well,

604
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,180
 but less rotten than Dan.

605
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,780
 - 'Cause this is one of their defenses, the puffing up,

606
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,020
 but it's not their only defense

607
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,900
 because they're incredibly poisonous.

608
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,260
 - Is it a defense though, if you can't use,

609
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,180
 they can't shoot their livers out of themselves, right?

610
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,400
 Which is what is most of the toxins.

611
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,220
 - I believe not.

612
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,220
 - Yeah, but it's a defense.

613
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,340
 - The advertiser that you're poisonous

614
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,300
 with what you look like, I suppose.

615
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,540
 - Yeah, okay, right.

616
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:44,020
 - You know, there's a thing in Japan where,

617
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,260
 so puff a fish and Fugu,

618
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,100
 there's different species of puff a fish, right?

619
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,900
 I think there's like 200 species

620
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,540
 and they all look a bit different.

621
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,060
 Fugu is a big one in Japan.

622
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,300
 It's a delicacy.

623
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,020
 We all know it to be dangerous,

624
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,580
 if not prepared by the correct chef

625
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,300
 because of all these toxins and poisons.

626
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,580
 And you do get trained as a chef.

627
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,860
 You've got to be over 20,

628
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,500
 you've got to spend years in an academy doing it.

629
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,820
 - Can I just quickly say?

630
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,660
 You don't.

631
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,980
 - Exactly, this is the problem.

632
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,780
 - It's regionally specific.

633
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:12,140
 So in some areas of Japan, you have to, as Dan says,

634
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,820
 you do a written test, you do a practical test,

635
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,020
 you do all sorts of stuff.

636
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,260
 Another bit of Japan, just go to a lecture.

637
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,820
 - Yeah, you can do it within an hour.

638
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,980
 - Can you do it on Zoom?

639
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:21,820
 - Yeah.

640
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,660
 (laughing)

641
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,500
 - You can get a license.

642
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,020
 - 'Cause that'd be great, 'cause you could just watch it

643
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,540
 and then put your camera so no one can see you

644
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,300
 and then you can just go to the pub.

645
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,940
 - Yeah, so chefs keep wanting to have regulations put in place.

646
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,220
 So I read an article, 2009,

647
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,700
 hundreds of people were poisoned

648
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,900
 by badly prepared Fugu, 34 of them died.

649
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,740
 - Wow.

650
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,780
 - Yeah, there was one guy,

651
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,740
 sorry, there was a group of men in Northern Japan

652
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,740
 who, when they ate grilled blowfish testicles,

653
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,980
 found themselves very, very ill

654
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,860
 because of unlicensed chefs.

655
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:52,700
 - Wow.

656
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,540
 - Yeah.

657
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,380
 - But what?

658
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,220
 - I just realized I've made a mistake.

659
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,740
 That was before the new license system in 2019.

660
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,580
 - Yeah, so yes.

661
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,300
 - It used to be regionally specific.

662
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,340
 I believe maybe now you can no longer

663
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,740
 just go to the Zoom lecture.

664
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,860
 - And that was for a long time

665
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,860
 and thousands of people were dying.

666
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,020
 - What's wrong with us though?

667
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,980
 It can't, is it curiosity?

668
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:11,940
 It can't be that good.

669
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,340
 What's wrong with us that we want to eat it?

670
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,180
 - I think it's tasty.

671
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,020
 - It can be that tasty.

672
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,380
 - Gives you a bit of a buzz.

673
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,380
 It makes your mouth tingle.

674
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,340
 - But I think, and the liver's the best bit

675
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,100
 and you're not allowed to eat that, I don't think.

676
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:22,940
 Odal, are you?

677
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,180
 Even if you're serving Fugu.

678
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,580
 - I think you have to remove the,

679
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,420
 well, it's meant to be.

680
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,820
 - 'Cause they serve, so like in 2011,

681
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,820
 there was a woman in a restaurant

682
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,620
 who specifically said to the chef,

683
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,820
 please give me the liver.

684
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,300
 I know you're not supposed to, but do it.

685
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,740
 And I think they do, so he did.

686
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,260
 And then she ended up going to hospital.

687
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,180
 - And there was a famous actor,

688
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,260
 a Japanese Kabuki theater actor

689
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,420
 called Mitsuguro Bando, the eighth.

690
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,580
 And in 1975, he went to a Fugu restaurant

691
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,980
 and he persuaded one of the chefs

692
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,260
 that he had developed a natural resistance to the toxin.

693
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,100
 He built it up and he asked the chef,

694
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,220
 can you do me some Fugu livers?

695
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,500
 And he got the plate, he ate four Fugu livers,

696
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,340
 then he died.

697
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,180
 - Yeah, right.

698
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,020
 - So I don't think he had,

699
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,940
 whether he thought he had built up a resistance or not,

700
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:01,780
 he hadn't.

701
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,260
 - The other thing is that these days

702
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,820
 you can make harmless Fugu.

703
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:09,260
 So they get the poison by eating the special bacteria.

704
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:13,220
 So if you can make your Fugu fish grow up in a place

705
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,660
 where this bacteria doesn't exist,

706
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,860
 then it's not gonna be poisonous.

707
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,260
 - It's amazing. - It's not the same.

708
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,100
 It's not the same.

709
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,460
 - Well, as chefs say, it seems insane.

710
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,940
 We can now breed Fugu that tastes the same,

711
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:24,780
 but don't poison you.

712
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,780
 And one chef was asked about it and said,

713
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,820
 no, I'm not gonna serve it.

714
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,780
 It's obviously more than a little exciting

715
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,380
 to go to a restaurant knowing it might be

716
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,060
 the last meal you ever eat.

717
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,580
 Where's the enjoyment in eating something

718
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,420
 with no risk in it?

719
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,260
 - Yeah, I completely agree.

720
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,420
 You know how you said it's different regionally

721
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:43,420
 in some places, in Shimono-Seki area,

722
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,940
 it's not called Fugu, it's called Fuku.

723
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,700
 - Oh. - Whoa.

724
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,660
 - Seems not appropriate.

725
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,500
 - Yeah.

726
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,500
 - 'Cause that's actually your last words

727
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,340
 to the chef when you're done.

728
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,260
 (all laughing)

729
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,460
 I don't think you know that you've been poisoned

730
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,380
 until about 25 minutes later.

731
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,220
 - Yep.

732
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,700
 - So I think you've got time to get the bill.

733
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,540
 You have to pay it.

734
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,300
 And then you realize, as you're leaving,

735
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,540
 hang on a second.

736
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,380
 - As someone who's been to a puff fish restaurant,

737
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,980
 they are very quick with the bill.

738
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,900
 (all laughing)

739
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,500
 - So you only had a starter 'cause there was nothing

740
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,980
 that wasn't Fugu on the menu.

741
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,860
 I think I've mentioned this before.

742
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,500
 - And you thought you were gonna have the chicken nuggets

743
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,580
 and they were the testicles?

744
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,900
 - It was the testicles.

745
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,420
 But now that I've heard that the testicles

746
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,660
 are poisonous and killed someone,

747
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,740
 I'm kind of glad that I didn't.

748
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,260
 - They're served separately often.

749
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,580
 They often have like a soul Fugu meal.

750
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,420
 - Yeah. - Right.

751
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:29,540
 - And it starts off with some sashimi slices.

752
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:32,860
 So just little raw slices arranged to look like a crane

753
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:36,860
 about to take flight, which is a symbol of longevity.

754
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,180
 - How I run it.

755
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,340
 (all laughing)

756
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,620
 - And then you get some Fugu stew,

757
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,300
 Fugu and rice porridge and hot sake

758
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,380
 with grilled Fugu fin in it and the testicles on the side.

759
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,140
 - And Fugu jelly and Fugu ice cream.

760
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:47,980
 - Oh, lovely.

761
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,420
 It was the Fugu hundreds of thousands

762
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,700
 and then a Fugu mint.

763
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,060
 (all laughing)

764
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,700
 - Have you ever tried puffer fish semen,

765
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,460
 which is another delicacy?

766
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,300
 - Okay.

767
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,140
 - No.

768
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:58,980
 - No.

769
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,820
 - Do you not have mayonnaise with your nuggets?

770
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:03,140
 (all laughing)

771
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,260
 - Is it poisonous?

772
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,340
 - Probably.

773
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,180
 - I don't have no idea.

774
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,020
 No, I think that--

775
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,940
 - It's milk in the UK, milk on toast.

776
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,300
 - Yeah, it was delicious.

777
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,140
 - What?

778
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,460
 - Milks is a relatively common, not these days.

779
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,300
 - No.

780
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,140
 - Like a hundred years ago

781
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,300
 in the northeast of England, you would eat milk for sure.

782
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,140
 - Stop it.

783
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:18,980
 - No, definitely.

784
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,580
 - So I think my mom always eats and then goes,

785
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,980
 it's ridiculous that people don't have this

786
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,940
 every day these days.

787
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,860
 (all laughing)

788
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,420
 - Come by actually, in my testicle in Metro.

789
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,420
 - Come by.

790
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,780
 - You know, Milton Keynes,

791
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:34,540
 that was named after the economist Keynes, John Keynes.

792
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,420
 - He was ejaculated on by a fish.

793
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,260
 (all laughing)

794
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,020
 - And named the town after him.

795
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,620
 - Oh, God.

796
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,700
 - That is torture.

797
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,980
 (all laughing)

798
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,100
 - I feel like we should talk about live pufferfish.

799
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:46,940
 - Yeah, okay.

800
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:49,220
 - 'Cause they're quite nice when they're alive

801
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,780
 and they make crop circles.

802
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,620
 - Oh, yes.

803
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,540
 - Which are stunning and worth looking at.

804
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,380
 And we only realized this recently.

805
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,220
 So we found these--

806
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,660
 - It's amazing they can get that far in land.

807
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,500
 It's stunning.

808
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,340
 (all laughing)

809
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,060
 - Well, there is a theory that the Roswell aliens

810
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,940
 actually were pufferfish.

811
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,780
 - Yeah.

812
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,140
 - Yeah, there's not.

813
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,180
 But they do make these extraordinary,

814
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,940
 they look like perfect fossils.

815
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,580
 You know, you get the typical--

816
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,420
 - Like ammonites.

817
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,420
 - Like ammonite fossils.

818
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,140
 Yeah, on the floor of the ocean,

819
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,260
 they're perfectly symmetrical.

820
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:18,420
 They're concentric rings with kind of spokes

821
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:21,420
 coming out from them and beautiful patterns.

822
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,140
 And they were discovered in 1995

823
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,540
 and no one knew what they were.

824
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,820
 They were just these mysterious things

825
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,060
 on the floor of the ocean.

826
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,780
 And it was only in 2013 that someone was down there

827
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,900
 doing a dive off the coast of Japan somewhere

828
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,260
 and went, hey, there's this pufferfish

829
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:36,380
 flapping its fins with the, and making this pattern.

830
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,340
 - Was it a mating thing,

831
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,180
 or is that a different situation?

832
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,020
 - Oh, yeah.

833
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:39,780
 - Yeah, 'cause there was an amazing answer

834
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,340
 for a piece on it, wasn't it?

835
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,980
 - So the female gets to sit

836
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,780
 in the middle of these concentric circles

837
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:47,820
 and if she likes it, she gives an egg up

838
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,740
 and he gives a sperm up.

839
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,340
 And in about one second, that's mating done.

840
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,180
 - Yeah.

841
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,020
 - And if not, she doesn't.

842
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:55,260
 - There is one theory that all she cares about

843
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,380
 is how much sand is there.

844
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,220
 - Yeah, right.

845
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,700
 - And she doesn't care about all these beautiful

846
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,340
 kind of circles and that.

847
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:02,740
 And the fact is that the circles are a byproduct

848
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,580
 of the fact that you have to do that

849
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,740
 to get all the sand into the middle.

850
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,900
 You just have to do it in a certain order.

851
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,220
 - So is it like, it's like the equivalent of,

852
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,860
 actually, my wife isn't interested in my model railway.

853
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,220
 It's that I've got a nice home,

854
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,860
 which the model railway is in.

855
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,940
 - It's a really good fight.

856
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,340
 Yeah, yeah, that's almost.

857
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,700
 - Foolish analogy.

858
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,420
 - I've got some questions to ask.

859
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,300
 I've got to go home, actually.

860
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,880
 (upbeat music)

861
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,180
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

862
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,500
 and that is my fact.

863
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,180
 My fact this week is, as there used to be no way

864
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,780
 of duplicating a record,

865
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:39,220
 one of the best selling songs of the 1890s

866
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:44,220
 had to be recorded over 10,000 times by the same singer.

867
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,140
 - That's amazing.

868
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:47,100
 - What is air in the recording studio, it must have been.

869
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,940
 - Well, days, eight days, eight days,

870
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,060
 and weeks and months,

871
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,540
 because basically every single record

872
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:56,860
 that you used to make back in the day was a master copy.

873
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,940
 That's what got sold.

874
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,660
 There was no way of then recording that

875
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,060
 into being another record.

876
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,420
 In the way that we have now, yeah.

877
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,140
 - So it's quite nice in a way

878
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,260
 because your record's different to everyone else's.

879
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,220
 - Yeah, exactly.

880
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,820
 You literally have a bespoke record.

881
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,380
 - If there's a little fart in the background,

882
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,300
 that's just for you.

883
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,820
 - Yeah, so there were no mics or no amplifiers.

884
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:17,180
 You had to just yell into the horn of the phonograph.

885
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:19,540
 And if you were particularly wealthy,

886
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:22,100
 you were able to get four or five horns around you.

887
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,900
 And so you could make up to five copies of a single song.

888
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:30,860
 So it's thought that the best selling single of the 1890s

889
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:33,140
 was sung by a guy who was an African-American

890
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:36,020
 called George Washington Johnson.

891
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:38,260
 And he was a street singer on the New York streets.

892
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,580
 He was just doing it for pennies.

893
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,580
 And he used to sing a couple of songs

894
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,660
 which were very, very backward and racist.

895
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,540
 And I think that's why people didn't mind

896
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:48,780
 a black singer being that well distributed.

897
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,940
 It was called, you know, one was, what were they called?

898
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,060
 - You don't need to read that out.

899
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:52,900
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

900
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,100
 - They did some lyrics.

901
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,180
 Yeah.

902
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,420
 No, but there was a lot of,

903
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,740
 it was a lot of taking himself down within the song.

904
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:01,420
 But one of the songs, which was the laughing song,

905
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,180
 that was the biggest song of the time.

906
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,300
 It sold 50,000 copies.

907
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,820
 So it said that he did copies

908
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:11,380
 that were like four to five horns in one go.

909
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,580
 And it sold 50,000.

910
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:15,060
 So at minimum, he sang it 10,000 times.

911
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:15,900
 - Amazing.

912
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,420
 - But it was probably more than, yeah.

913
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,420
 - Was the laughing song just laughing?

914
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,780
 - No, that was the chorus.

915
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,460
 - So people might know it actually.

916
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,660
 I reckon people listen to this, some of them will know it

917
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,220
 because it was covered loads of times,

918
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:31,700
 especially in the UK, a slightly different version called "The Laughing Policeman" song.

919
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,860
 - Oh yeah! - Which I love as a child.

920
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,060
 - Me too! - Well, it's exactly the same.

921
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:38,660
 It's the same song, but obviously they removed all of the racist stuff

922
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:47,460
 and replaced it with a fat policeman who goes, "Wah! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha."

923
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,460
 And that's the song. - It's great. - Yeah.

924
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:58,580
 - But when I was reading about this, I thought, "How... I can't believe the things that entertained people in the 1890s, and now you're right. We found that very entertaining in our childhood. Good on him."

925
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:09,220
 - Yeah, Johnson, George Washington Johnson, he had quite a sad end because they worked out how to replicate music, and he no longer had a job for life, basically.

926
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,380
 - Yeah, because there were no royalties. - No, exactly.

927
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:17,780
 - So you got paid for doing your recording, but once they managed to just copy stuff, then you'd never got any money anymore.

928
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:20,900
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Like Spotify of its day. - Yeah.

929
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:47,460
 - Ooh, controversial for our largest distribution outlet. - Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. - Yeah, he had a... He had a... The middle bit where he was singing the song might have been the only kind of peaceful bit of his life, really, because he was born in 1846 into slavery. He was made to be the best friend of the child of the family, so he sort of had...

930
00:29:47,780 --> 00:30:16,460
 - The playmate thing for the white family. - Yeah, so he then was freed, and he went to New York, where he lived in Hell's Kitchen, and he was doing all this stuff where he was sort of, you know, on the street singing. Then this big moment happens where he gets to sing all these songs, as James points out, then they work out how to duplicate it. So his career is dead after, you know, sitting in a booth 20,000 times, minimum, singing this stuff. And then life gets really weird for him, as Andy points out. He was charged with murder. He was never convicted, but he was brought onto it.

931
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,900
 - Yeah. - He was brought onto him.

932
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:37,420
 - Both of his wives died suddenly when living with him, and yeah, he was charged with trying to murder one of them, well, actually murdering one of them. I did read a report of an altercation he had with his wife, and this was in the Earth newspaper in 1899, and its headline was "Too Much Whistling," because his main thing was whistling, right?

933
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:46,420
 - Yeah. - And he was famous on the streets of New York for whistling. And it said, "George Rottington Johnson is in trouble," because he couldn't restrain his disposition to whistle at all times.

934
00:30:47,380 --> 00:31:01,380
 He crawled with his wife, because she got tired of him whistling all over the house, so she shot him, and he thumped her, and died the next night. So that was a story in what I assume was a tabloid equivalent. He whistled too much. She shot him. He hit her.

935
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,380
 - And then she died. - And then she died.

936
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:07,380
 - Right. - In the olden days, you could just make a living from being really good at whistling.

937
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:11,380
 - I was just thinking that. - Yeah, but you don't have to code or anything. - No.

938
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:26,380
 - You could just whistle. - There was a guy called Freeman Davis, who was known as Brother Bones, who was a shoeshine boy, and people noticed how good he was at whistling. And he would also play his shoeshine instruments, like the spoons you might do.

939
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:31,380
 And he became really famous, and his whistling became the theme song of the Harlem Club Trotters.

940
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:45,380
 There was Sibyl Sanderson Fagan, who was one of the most famous whistlers in America in the 1920s, and she would do whistling of birdsong, so you would buy a vinyl and it would just be her pretending to be a thrush or a mockingbird or something.

941
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:57,380
 She left her husband, who was a playwright called Eugene P. Bardin, because she claimed that he had drugged her on her wedding day. And so she got married because she said that she'd been drugged into getting married.

942
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:02,380
 - He drugged her into the marriage? I thought he meant after the wedding had happened, then he drugged her. Oh my goodness.

943
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:15,380
 - There was Fred Lowry, who was a professional whistler in the 40s and 50s, who was blinded by Scala Fever at the age of two, then became a whistler, and then he later went away from pop music and became a religious whistler.

944
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:22,380
 - Oh, religious whistler. - Yeah, he would go to churches and whistle hymns instead of whistling pop songs. - Nice.

945
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:30,380
 - But yeah, it's just amazing that you've got all these people who, all they could do was whistle. I'm not all we could do is podcast, so it's... - Exactly, yeah, yeah.

946
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:38,380
 - I can whistle. - Oh yeah? Let's hear your thrush. - Oh my thrush. Oh shit, I've got thrush.

947
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:45,380
 - Well, there wasn't the first Eurovision. The Half Time Act was a troop of whistlers called the Rossignols, I think, yeah.

948
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:50,380
 - Oh, that means Nightingale in French. - Oh, there we go. Okay, well, that is all coming together.

949
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:58,380
 - Yeah, yeah, so it's a big deal. - If you say in French "J'ai les Rossignols", which I think means "I have Rossignols",

950
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:04,380
 it means there's a problem with your car, because it's like you have Nightingales in your engine and it's making a weird tweeting noise.

951
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:12,380
 - Nice. - The earliest sound recording we have, we actually only heard a few years ago, but it was from way earlier than we thought.

952
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:22,380
 It was like 20 years before Edison in 1857, and it was a French guy called Edouard-Léon Scott de Matam V, and he basically recorded sound,

953
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:30,380
 but he didn't know how to play it back. He hadn't invented the instrument to transmit it in, so he just recorded it onto a bit of paper.

954
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:37,380
 - That takes a lot of trust when you go to the dragons. Not honestly, I have recorded sound, just can't hear it. It's fine.

955
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:45,380
 - You can show them the paper and give it, this would sound amazing if you try to imagine it, and we managed to engineer it in 2008 to play.

956
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:49,380
 - Wow, his piece of paper. - His piece of paper is 1860 piece of paper.

957
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:55,380
 - Indicated. - Yeah, it was covered in soot and the sound waves were etched in.

958
00:33:55,380 --> 00:34:13,380
 - Vinyl is PVC, and that was invented or first synthesized by a guy, a German chemist called Eugene Bauman in 1872, and he had been making some vinyl chloride in a flask and had just left it on a shelf for a few days,

959
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:21,380
 maybe a few weeks, the sunlight had got on it, and then there was a white compound in there, and he thought, I wonder what this is, and that turned out to be PVC.

960
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:37,380
 - Wow. - Did he then stick his arm in the flask to try and get it out, and it formed a sexy PVC glove, and he realized this has huge implications for the erotic clothing industry.

961
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:53,380
 - Well, that is the story, that's really what happened. Eugene Bauman also identified the sauce for the smells in urine, and proved the active ingredients in your thyroid gland, which is what stops you from getting goiters.

962
00:34:53,380 --> 00:35:01,380
 - Oh. - So just a few things about him. - Wow, what a range. - It's all chemistry. - What do you lead with, though? - On the CV.

963
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:15,380
 - Oh, I know why Pee smells, I know why Piss smells. - If you're sat next to someone at a wedding, and they say, what do you do? You say, I'm a chemist, and they go, oh, have you chemisted anything that I might know, then what is for a smell?

964
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:25,380
 - Have you ever smelled some piss? I know why. - Your best man is very rude. - Oh, dear.

965
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:35,380
 - I don't think we've ever mentioned Chichester Bell before, because I didn't know about him anyway. - Is that person? - He's Alexander Graham Bell's brother. - Stop it.

966
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:54,380
 - Really? - He's also a phonograph pioneer. - Chichester Bell, what a name. - He invented the earliest voicemail. Round about the time his brother, Alex, was working on phones. Yeah, he invented voicemail, and the way it worked was, it was a phonograph cylinder that you recorded your voice onto.

967
00:35:54,380 --> 00:36:15,380
 - So the grooves are all in the right place, and then you just posted it to your friend. - The problem is that they would get it, and they'd be like, oh, who's it from? And they go, Chichester Bell, and they go, fuck off. That's just spam, mate.

968
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:20,380
 - OK, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Anna.

969
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:27,380
 - My fact this week is that the US government maintains a database of dad jokes.

970
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:34,380
 - What an excellent fact. - There we are, we're off the blocks again. - There we go.

971
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:42,380
 - Three guys absolutely straining for a dad joke there. - I don't know why I presented this fact, because there's promises to be held in the next 20 minutes with you guys.

972
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:57,380
 But this is on a website that's run by the Office of Family Assistance, which is a government resource for fathers, basically, for families, and they have a website within that called the National Responsible Fatherhood Clearinghouse.

973
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:10,380
 And if you go to that website, which I would recommend, then you can click on dad resources, and you can submit your own dad jokes, and you can click, give me a joke, and they'll give you a dad joke.

974
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:14,380
 You can click, give me another, they'll give you another. I don't know how long it goes on for, or I sat there for about half an hour.

975
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:23,380
 - If you go to the mum section of this website, is it all practical stuff? Like how to feed a baby, how to change a baby, how to keep a baby alive.

976
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:29,380
 - It's a load of your mum jokes.

977
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:38,380
 - And yeah, I thought that was really interesting. And I guess the idea is that being a father is perhaps something people need help with, of course, as they do with all the bits of parenting.

978
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:47,380
 And it's a useful skill to have in your back pocket as a dad, being able to whip out a really bad, really inoffensive joke, which seems to basically be the definition is that they're bad and they're not offensive.

979
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:55,380
 - Yeah, so they give you a bunch of the jokes with the reveals on the site. All right, so here's the first one that came up that I saw. What do you call a man with a rubber toe?

980
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,380
 - Ah, Roberto.

981
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,380
 - Roberto, yes.

982
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:13,380
 - I don't think that's a dad joke, actually. I would say, so my definition of a dad joke is a joke where it is in response to something a child often says, and you always repeat it all the time, all the time, all the time.

983
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:21,380
 So for instance, Anna's mum joke, which is, can you turn on the light and then your mum goes and flirts with the light and she's like, are you turned on yet?

984
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,380
 - Yes.

985
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:25,380
 - I think that's a dad joke because it's something that kids will always say.

986
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:34,380
 - I have an actual dad joke that I do, and I've been doing for six years now, every single time it's said, and it's whenever it's kind of getting to the evening and Fenella says, can you draw the curtains?

987
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,380
 - Okay.

988
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,380
 - I always say.

989
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,380
 - Can I have a pencil?

990
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:40,380
 - I'd love to, but I don't have a pencil.

991
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:42,380
 - Yeah, that's a dad joke, I think.

992
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:56,380
 - Interesting, I think they're two strounds of dad-jokism, which is a complex being, I agree that is one, but then I think, I remember, you know, my dad's whole jokes and they seem to very much fall into the dad-joke category of what does a dog call the thing on top of a house?

993
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,380
 - Ruff.

994
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:59,380
 - Would he regularly say it?

995
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:03,380
 - Yeah, I think these are things that you regularly say.

996
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,380
 - I kind of feel like they're more cracker jokes, like Christmas cracker jokes.

997
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:11,380
 - Well, there's a thin line, there's a really nice theory about why dad jokes are good. This is great.

998
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,380
 - Why, they're good?

999
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:15,380
 - Well, no, not, sorry, why they happen.

1000
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,380
 - They are good.

1001
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:20,380
 - Well, no, I mean your one about the curtains was amazing.

1002
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,380
 - Another pencil, please.

1003
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,380
 - Brilliant.

1004
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:23,380
 - Gets a laugh every time.

1005
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:28,380
 - So the idea is that, this is from the British Psychological Society. I personally, I'm not sure I buy it, but I like it.

1006
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:36,380
 It's that by continually telling their children jokes that are so bad they're embarrassing, fathers may be pushing their children's limits of how much embarrassment they can handle.

1007
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,380
 - That's great.

1008
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:42,380
 - Showing your child that embarrassment isn't fatal because the child is mortified here.

1009
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:50,380
 And if you're, you know, your child is adolescent, which feels again a bit like the ship has sailed in terms of, you know, dad jokes normally when a child is five or five.

1010
00:39:50,380 --> 00:40:01,380
 But there's a, the sort of theory builds because the theory is if your child has been exposed to years of awful jokes by this point and has shown that dad can cope with people not caring that people think dad is an idiot,

1011
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,380
 the children will be able to be themselves better.

1012
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,380
 - How interesting.

1013
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:08,380
 - But it's more for the benefit of the dad.

1014
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:14,380
 - I don't know. I feel like, well, James, I feel like you wrote this up in a book for one of the QI books.

1015
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:18,380
 - I did, yeah, QI books. So I read quite a few theories, that one included.

1016
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:27,380
 Another one about why they happen is when you have a kid who's two years old, like I do almost, basically they'll laugh at anything, like literally anything.

1017
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:35,380
 If I say to my daughter, like she wants to read Mogg, and I say, do you want to read Moog? She will piss herself laughing.

1018
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:39,380
 And then if I'm like, oh, do you want to read the very hurri-coud-de-poudre?

1019
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,380
 She'll just find it the funniest thing in the world, right?

1020
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:42,380
 And the idea being-

1021
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,380
 - You're making her racist against buildings.

1022
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:48,380
 - I'm still not over water leaving.

1023
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,380
 - It's very true.

1024
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:53,380
 - The thing is, the kids will laugh at almost anything.

1025
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:59,380
 And then as a dad, that kind of builds your confidence. And then as you get older, you're like, this idiot will laugh at everything.

1026
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:02,380
 And she always laughed at whatever I said, Moog instead of Mogg.

1027
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:05,380
 So I'm going to keep doing it. And you just keep doing it and keep doing it.

1028
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:08,380
 And then as the kids get older, they realize this isn't funny at all.

1029
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:11,380
 And that's when they realize that they're dad jokes.

1030
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:15,380
 - Wow. Does the dadness of the joke depend on the child understanding it's not funny?

1031
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:19,380
 - I think someone has to be on the outside knowing that it's not funny. It might be my wife.

1032
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:26,380
 - She would know it's a dad joke. But the other thing is like quite often they're kind of wordplay-ish.

1033
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:31,380
 And there's a theory that by doing this wordplay again and again and again, it helps to teach language skills.

1034
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,380
 - Yeah.

1035
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,380
 - I'll buy that.

1036
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:34,380
 - Yeah, exactly that.

1037
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:40,380
 And I think also it teaches them a joke structure and it just brings funniness to the house.

1038
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:43,380
 It's just a great way to keep things funny in the house.

1039
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,380
 - I still think that I really like them. I'm very fond of them.

1040
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:48,380
 I think by definition, a dad joke isn't funny.

1041
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,380
 That's what it is. It's a joke that's kind of predictable.

1042
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:53,380
 So I read an article by a linguist about dad jokes.

1043
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:57,380
 And I thought the example that she used was not a dad joke for me because I thought it was actually funny.

1044
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:59,380
 - It wasn't the Bunga Bunga one, was it?

1045
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:04,380
 We can't have that again. The left is the last time.

1046
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:07,380
 - Oh, it's privately inoffensive, okay? It doesn't cross that boundary.

1047
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:13,380
 But the joke is that a man comes up to a widow at the funeral of his old friend and he says to the widow,

1048
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:18,380
 "Do you mind if I say a word?" And she nods and the man clears his throat and says gently,

1049
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:22,380
 "Plethora." And the wife smiles sadly and replies,

1050
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:24,380
 "Thanks. That means a lot."

1051
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,380
 - I think that's a very good joke.

1052
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:29,380
 - It's a good joke. It's too good. It's too good.

1053
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,380
 - Can I give you some examples of dad jokes?

1054
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:37,380
 When I was writing this article for the QI book, I asked my followers on Twitter for some dad jokes.

1055
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:42,380
 So I'll give you the kid saying something and you have to say what the dad says as a joke.

1056
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:44,380
 - Oh, yeah, okay.

1057
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:48,380
 - So Adam Sear said that he would say, "Are you all right, dad?"

1058
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:52,380
 - No, I've got a left-hand side as well.

1059
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,380
 - No, I'm half left.

1060
00:42:54,380 --> 00:43:00,380
 - Chris Emerson, our friend Chris Emerson, said he would say to his dad, "I'm off."

1061
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:02,380
 - Off what?

1062
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,380
 - Off com.

1063
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:08,380
 - And the dad would reply, "I wondered what that smell was."

1064
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:10,380
 - Oh, that's good.

1065
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:14,380
 - And Cardinal Grumpy, I think perhaps not his real name.

1066
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:18,380
 - Senior prelate in the Catholic Church.

1067
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:22,380
 - If they said, "I'm thirsty," so their dad, what would be the reply?

1068
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:24,380
 - I'm dad. Nice to meet you.

1069
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:25,380
 - Pretty close.

1070
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:27,380
 - Oh, no, it's Wednesday.

1071
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:28,380
 - Oh, put them together.

1072
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:31,380
 - Hi, I'm Wednesday. Chased the date.

1073
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:34,380
 - Friday. No, you're not. You're Friday.

1074
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:36,380
 - You're pretty much that. Who else is Friday?

1075
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:40,380
 Okay, I'm going to give it you. So he says, "Dad, I'm thirsty."

1076
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:45,380
 Dad says, "Please to meet you Thursday. I'm Friday, and he's Robin St. Crusoe."

1077
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:46,380
 - Oh.

1078
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:49,380
 - Wow, that's a really well-read kid.

1079
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:53,380
 - Do you want to hear one of the first-ever "Your Mum" jokes?

1080
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,380
 - Yeah, go on.

1081
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,380
 - Was it like Babylonian? Is it like as far back as that?

1082
00:43:56,380 --> 00:44:03,380
 - There is one, and it's from a partial bit of text.

1083
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:07,380
 - So it's not really clear what the entire joke is.

1084
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:08,380
 - Right.

1085
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:13,380
 - But there is another one from 100AD, which is Rabbi Eliezer,

1086
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:17,380
 was said to have gone and interrupted a man who had been reading a banned text,

1087
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:20,380
 which was Ezekiel 23, by asking him,

1088
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:25,380
 "Why don't you go out and proclaim the abominations of your mother?"

1089
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:27,380
 - Is that a "Your Mum" joke?

1090
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:28,380
 - It's a prototype.

1091
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:30,380
 - Yeah, absolutely a "Your Mum" joke.

1092
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:34,380
 - Did you find it extremely funny? Judging by the look on your face.

1093
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,380
 - The sad thing is, I'm afraid, for the listeners,

1094
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:40,380
 is that you'll all now remember all of these really bad jokes that we've told,

1095
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:42,380
 more than you remember a good joke,

1096
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:45,380
 because studies show that you remember bad jokes more than good jokes

1097
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:48,380
 because of the way they work, because they are predictable.

1098
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:52,380
 The reason that we can kind of guess the endings to the dad jokes that James asked for

1099
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:56,380
 is that they are formulaic, good for teaching kids how these patterns work,

1100
00:44:56,380 --> 00:45:00,380
 but the definition of good humor that makes you actually laugh is that you subvert that,

1101
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:02,380
 like pull the rug out from under someone's feet.

1102
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:04,380
 It's unexpected. So you never remember them.

1103
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:07,380
 So it's so annoying. You'll only ever remember shit jokes.

1104
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:09,380
 - So it's like, are you all right, dad?

1105
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:11,380
 No, I have a terrible, incurable disease,

1106
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:14,380
 and I won't be with you in a week's time.

1107
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:18,380
 You got that from the new Ricky Gervais special, didn't you?

1108
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:21,380
 That subverts the non.

1109
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:23,380
 - It does. I think it does still have to be funny.

1110
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:25,380
 - All right, OK.

1111
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:27,380
 They exist in other languages.

1112
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:31,380
 In France, as a child, if you say what, what, what, what,

1113
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:33,380
 they wouldn't understand you because they're French.

1114
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:36,380
 But if they say it in French, they say "quoi".

1115
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:40,380
 And any self-respecting dad will reply "foi",

1116
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:44,380
 "quoi", "foi", "foi", "foi", which means hairdresser, "quoi", "foi".

1117
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:48,380
 And in Spain, if a dad sees some soy milk,

1118
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:51,380
 he might say "holla milk, soy papi".

1119
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:53,380
 - Lovely. - Yes, very good.

1120
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:56,380
 Because "soy" means "I am", so it means "hi, milk", "I'm dad".

1121
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:58,380
 - Nice, very nice. - Very nice.

1122
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,380
 That's the "I'm hungry, hi, hungry, I'm dad"

1123
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:05,380
 is in nine states of America the most ticked as used dad joke.

1124
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:07,380
 - Oh, nice. - That's a proper dad joke.

1125
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:09,380
 OK, this is like the parenting test you get

1126
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:12,380
 after your kid's one or something, you're back to the GP.

1127
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:14,380
 Please check this box. Can they walk? Can they talk?

1128
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:17,380
 How many times have you told this joke?

1129
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:19,380
 I nearly got got researching this fact.

1130
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:23,380
 It was a report on NPR, obviously really well-respected radio station

1131
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:25,380
 and great source of lots of stuff.

1132
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:28,380
 And it was about a list of Roman jokes,

1133
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:31,380
 ancient Roman jokes that have been found.

1134
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:34,380
 And it was a scroll found in an amphitheatre

1135
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:37,380
 and they'd done some amazing analysis.

1136
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,380
 You know the X-ray of scroll and they managed

1137
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:42,380
 without unrolling it to scan what's inside.

1138
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:44,380
 And it was all these phrases found in Latin

1139
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:47,380
 and like a translation was, "Did you hear the rumour about butter?"

1140
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:49,380
 "Oh, well, I'm not going to spread it."

1141
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:52,380
 I thought you were going to say, "Butter? I hardly knew her."

1142
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:57,380
 It was a bit more PG than that, this scroll.

1143
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:00,380
 And then I got really far into this article

1144
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:03,380
 and then eventually I got to the claim that Caesar had turned up

1145
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:06,380
 and addressed a crowd of senators who were angry with him

1146
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:09,380
 by asking them, "What did the cucumber say to the pickle?"

1147
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:12,380
 And I realised, I looked at the day, it was an April the first article.

1148
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:14,380
 And what did he say?

1149
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:16,380
 "You mean a great deal to me."

1150
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,380
 "Oh, good grief."

1151
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:20,380
 "Why are you getting your knives out?"

1152
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:25,380
 So he did deserve it after all.

1153
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:28,380
 It is weird that these exist all around the world though,

1154
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:30,380
 this stereotype, or in so many different countries.

1155
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:34,380
 Like Japan has old man jokes, which are oyaji,

1156
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:36,380
 old man, then gyagu joke.

1157
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:38,380
 -Gyagu, like gag? -Yeah, like gag.

1158
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:41,380
 That's how they make a lot of words in Japanese,

1159
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:43,380
 don't they? They take an English word.

1160
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:45,380
 So at the end, in Japanese,

1161
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:47,380
 every word has to end with a vowel or an N.

1162
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:50,380
 Like very new, yeah, so it's like a new word.

1163
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:54,380
 T-shirt too, is T-shirt.

1164
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:56,380
 Okay, very easy to guess.

1165
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:58,380
 This is like an extremely easy test.

1166
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:00,380
 It's not much of a quiz, is it?

1167
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:03,380
 Korea, they have middle-aged man jokes,

1168
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,380
 literally middle-aged man jokes.

1169
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:07,380
 Danish has various different versions.

1170
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:09,380
 They've got uncle humor, onkel humor.

1171
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:15,380
 I would say we've been advertising Babel for quite a long time,

1172
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:19,380
 but it seems like you could just say words slightly

1173
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:21,380
 in an accent, and that works.

1174
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:23,380
 What's the Danish one though?

1175
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:25,380
 Because my step-grandfather's Danish,

1176
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:27,380
 and he always used to do whatever their version is.

1177
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:29,380
 Oh, well, uncle humor is onkel humor,

1178
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:32,380
 but for him, I think he would be more far vittagede,

1179
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:34,380
 which is grandfather humor.

1180
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:36,380
 Father humor, so at the end of every meal,

1181
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:38,380
 whenever the waiter came over to get our plates,

1182
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:39,380
 they'd say, "Are you finished?"

1183
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:41,380
 And he'd say, "No, I'm Danish."

1184
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:43,380
 Wow, that is very good.

1185
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:46,380
 Would you like some water? No, fish fucking it.

1186
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:48,380
 I was a bit young for that, I was eight.

1187
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:51,380
 That's a WC Fields joke, isn't it?

1188
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:53,380
 Yeah, that's all right.

1189
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:55,380
 Guys, do you know what a BJ joke is?

1190
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:58,380
 Dude, yeah, I do.

1191
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:00,380
 I don't think you do.

1192
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:04,380
 BJ joke, so what could it be?

1193
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:07,380
 Boris Johnson?

1194
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:09,380
 Yeah, it is technically one of those as well, I suppose.

1195
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:11,380
 Just shot for bad joke?

1196
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:13,380
 It's one of those, it's none of those.

1197
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:15,380
 This is in one study, at least,

1198
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:18,380
 which seemed to use the officially accepted academic terms for jokes.

1199
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:21,380
 This is a 2016 study, because I was looking at whether men and women

1200
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:23,380
 do find different jokes funny,

1201
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:27,380
 because it's such a gender-based concept, the dad joke.

1202
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:29,380
 And so there's a study that looked at whether they did,

1203
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:33,380
 and they divided jokes into EJs, AJs and BJs, which are...

1204
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:35,380
 Excellent adequate in bed.

1205
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:37,380
 It should be that.

1206
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:40,380
 It's exaggeration jokes, ambiguity jokes,

1207
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:42,380
 and bridging inference jokes.

1208
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:44,380
 And so BJs are the bridging inference,

1209
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:48,380
 and that basically means that they require you to actually get the joke.

1210
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:51,380
 So when you listen to the joke, you have to attribute an intention to another.

1211
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:53,380
 So an example would be,

1212
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:57,380
 Jack's dream of becoming a writer comes true when his books finally publish.

1213
00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:00,380
 He asks his friend, "Have you read my book yet?"

1214
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:02,380
 His friend said, "Yes, and I bought one."

1215
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:05,380
 And Jack happily responded, "Oh, that was you!"

1216
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:07,380
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, right.

1217
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:10,380
 Yeah, it's kind of a bad joke that we've sort of all made about the rest books.

1218
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:12,380
 That's how you tell them.

1219
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:14,380
 You really didn't sell that one at all.

1220
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:18,380
 I think even Will would have been like, "I'm sorry, auntie Anna, no."

1221
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:20,380
 It wasn't good, was it? I'm sorry.

1222
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:22,380
 Why is that a BJ?

1223
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:26,380
 Because we're inferring from the joke that he doesn't sell many of his books.

1224
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:27,380
 That he's only told one.

1225
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:29,380
 And you so thankfully gave him a blowjob.

1226
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:34,380
 You did that with every book that you sold.

1227
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:36,380
 Didn't you? 10,000 blowjabs.

1228
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:38,380
 A bit like George Washington Johnson.

1229
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:42,380
 You could do five at the same time. That's the impressive thing.

1230
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:54,380
 OK, that's it. That is all of our facts.

1231
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:55,380
