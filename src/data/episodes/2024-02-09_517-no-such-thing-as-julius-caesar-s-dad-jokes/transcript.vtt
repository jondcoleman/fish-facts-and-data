00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:17.040
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.720
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.360
 coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.040
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.600
 with Anna Tyshensky, James Harkin, and Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.720
 and once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.520
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.720
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.280
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.560
 My fact is that thousands of soldiers who died

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.720
 at Waterloo were turned into sugar.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.200
 - Incredible.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.360
 - It's a horrible fact about a horrible battle.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.800
 - Wow. - It's incredible.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.160
 - It's really bad. - I'm mad this one.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.620
 - Yeah, how do you turn a person into sugar?

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.040
 That seems very unlikely.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.200
 - Well, firstly-- - I'll ask you for a friend.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.200
 - You have to lure them to Waterloo in 1815, kill them.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.320
 - Oh, so I have to be French?

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.560
 - Well, oh, I'm so glad we got onto this already.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.960
 There are so many nationalities who fought at Waterloo.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:11.800
 - Oh yeah.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.680
 - Actually, most of the English army was German.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.240
 - Isn't that nice? - Yeah, I didn't realize that.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.680
 - Two thirds were German speaking as a first language,

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.120
 lots of Dutch soldiers as well.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.520
 - Belgian, yeah, they were just brought in, weren't they?

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.760
 Sort of, we don't have enough, can you fight?

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.880
 - If you're listening to this in Europe,

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.560
 probably your nationality was represented at Waterloo

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.560
 in some capacity or another.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.960
 - Yeah, yeah. - And more than the Brits,

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.800
 who constituted about 12% of the British led army.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.280
 - Oh, it was about a third, it was about a third.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.400
 - Estimates may vary.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.640
 - Oh, they do, they vary-- - I think at the lower end,

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.440
 we think maybe only, you know.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.440
 - So what are we saying in case you don't like

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.720
 British sugar, don't worry.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.360
 There is multinational sugar in it.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.560
 - Well, it was, they set up a sugar factory

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.800
 pretty much on the battlefield.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.200
 I mean, it was all a bit--

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.680
 - Can I refer you to my earlier question?

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.200
 - How does one turn a human into some sugar?

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.040
 - All right, thank you.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.640
 - Because sugar is a thing that grows in the ground

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.400
 in sugar beet or sugar cane, and then you harvest it,

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.840
 and there are no humans involved.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.320
 - That's true, that's true.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.360
 But what you do need to do is filter sugar syrup

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.960
 when you're making the sugar.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.320
 So this was something, basically,

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.800
 very, very few bodies have been found

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.480
 on the battlefield at Waterloo.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.080
 Like, suspiciously few.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.120
 - Isn't it just, yeah. - Two full skeletons,

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.280
 of 20,000 of them.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.280
 - Are we sure it wasn't just Napoleon and Wellington?

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.840
 Just coming at it.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.080
 - And they just really over-engaged,

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.440
 like, whoever won really told the much bigger lie

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.760
 about what had happened there.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.480
 - It's the greatest prank in history.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.360
 Let's really pull the wool over those 21st century idiots eyes.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.560
 - No, so there were lots of graves,

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.400
 and there were huge graves,

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.600
 but only a few bones have been found.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.680
 Like, as you say, two full skeletons,

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.520
 they found three legs relatively recently,

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.400
 as well recently, which was near one of the hospitals.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.520
 So those were probably amputated legs on the day.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.680
 - Oh, right, so it's not that it was Napoleon versus Wellington,

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.080
 and one of them had three legs.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.320
 - Yeah, that's what I was hoping.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.400
 One of the skeletons was a tripod.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.920
 - But you're right, there should have been huge numbers

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.200
 of dead people, or bodies in the ground.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.160
 And the theory is, and this is quite a recent theory

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.560
 that's been developed, is that in the aftermath of the battle,

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.760
 the local residents, or the sort of local peasants,

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.560
 they dug up the corpses, and they sold the bones

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.960
 to people working in the sugar beet industry,

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.600
 because the bones were really valuable at the time,

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.080
 and normally animal bones were used.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.080
 You would cook the bones.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.200
 That made a powder called noir animal,

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.000
 which you could use to filter the sugar syrup

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.600
 and make lovely, clean sugar.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.440
 So these days, noir animal is still used,

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.960
 but animal bones, and also not in sugar,

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.480
 it's used for other products and things.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.000
 So sugar these days hasn't been in any bones.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.360
 - Sugar is vegan.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.040
 - Don't worry, yeah, vegetarians worldwide.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.880
 - Sugar is vegan.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.520
 But the theory is that local peasants

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.360
 just dug up the bodies and used the bones

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.320
 for this industry, and it's a pretty

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.160
 compelling theory at the moment.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.320
 - 'Cause we've known for ages

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.720
 that they took the teeth out of people, didn't they?

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.560
 - Yeah.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.840
 - And they used them for false teeth,

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.000
 and so false teeth were known as waterloo teeth.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.600
 - Yeah, waterloo ivory. - For hundreds of years.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.440
 - Such a, yeah, it's so dark.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.280
 - Very macabre, yeah.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.960
 - And they did write about the sugar thing

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.360
 back in the 1800s, or it was a German newspaper

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.280
 that actually wrote, you should be using honey to sweeten food

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.040
 and avoid risk of having your great-grandfather's atoms

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.200
 dissolved in your coffee one fine morning.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.040
 - Wow.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.960
 - I like that, I quite like that idea

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.760
 of recycling your grandparents into your body.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.960
 - Absolutely, yeah, yeah.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.760
 - And in 1822, there was an article in The Observer

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.080
 that said, "It is now ascertained beyond the doubt

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.880
 by actual experiments on an extensive scale

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.480
 that a dead soldier is a most valuable article of commerce."

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.680
 And they were talking about the fact

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.360
 that they were ground up and used as fertilizer.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.320
 - Yes, they were, weren't they?

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.040
 They covered the fields of Europe.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.720
 - I suppose, in a way, it's recycling.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.000
 - Yeah, good on them. - Isn't it?

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.440
 - Like, once you're dead, like, do you really care?

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.440
 - Exactly.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.400
 - A controversial question.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.120
 - Wow, it's not that controversial.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.240
 Once you're dead, I'm pretty sure you don't care.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.960
 Unless you're a ghost, I suppose.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.800
 - A woman does one care.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.640
 Some people care what happens to, you know, the dead.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.040
 - There was a single-- - Uncontroversial.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.960
 - There was a single, The Bone Rush.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.400
 And it was partly because, it was actually partly

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.600
 because of Britain, because Britain blockaded sugar.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.040
 Right, 'cause most sugar came from places

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.280
 like the West Indies, which were British colonies

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.720
 at the time, and Britain had blockaded that,

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.360
 so not much sugar could get to Europe.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.760
 So Europe set up a big sugar beet industry

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.960
 that was a kind of way of making sugar

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.680
 that didn't rely on shipping.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.400
 So that, and then that needed the bones.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.640
 So, in a sense-- - So thank God for Waterloo.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:35.480
 - In a sense, it's our fault.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.560
 - Yeah, yeah. - In a sense.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.360
 - In a sense. - In a sense.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.080
 Waterloo, I can't believe,

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.000
 I can't believe we've hardly talked about Waterloo before.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.960
 I'm so excited.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.560
 I can't believe we're only gonna do one section on it.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.960
 Like, the rest is history, guys.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.600
 They would get eight episodes out of the Battle of Waterloo.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.080
 And we have to cram it into 15 minutes.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.920
 It's not fair.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.000
 - I think you're optimistic about 15 minutes,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 I'll be honest. - Yeah.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.560
 - I'm looking at some of the other facts coming up,

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.000
 and I reckon they might be a bit longer.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.560
 - Oh no, it's so interesting. - You're allowed one fact, Andy.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.040
 - No, we've gotta go through the whole--

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.880
 - What's your fave?

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.320
 What's your fave Waterloo fact?

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.160
 Apart from the headline, obviously, which--

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.920
 - Oh, man. - My definition is.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.240
 - I'm quite interested in the cavalry charges and stuff,

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.520
 and the farmhouse at the centre of it all,

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.360
 and all that.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.680
 And the stuff that doesn't make very good stuff for our show,

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.960
 I suppose. - You have brought a lot of

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.720
 toy soldiers onto the table today.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.080
 (laughing)

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.360
 - Well, there is.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.640
 Have you heard of the Siborn model?

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:23.480
 - No. - No.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.320
 - This is so cool.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.120
 This is like, I tried to stick to mostly the aftermath

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.120
 of the battle, rather than in-depth troop movements.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.680
 You're welcome.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.160
 But there was a captain called William Siborn,

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.680
 who made a huge model of the Battle of Waterloo,

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.440
 15 years after it had happened.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.960
 And he spent eight weeks on the battlefield itself,

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:42.800
 just researching.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.680
 He took seven years to make it.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.080
 He made, well, he certainly put 80,000 model soldiers

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.160
 on this 400-square-foot model.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.000
 It's massive.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.840
 - In a way, though, what we've got is one guy going

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.000
 to the battlefield saying, "Okay, I need to know

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.800
 where everyone was so I can make the model."

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.280
 But at the same time, all of the locals are coming in,

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.760
 moving all the bodies around and taking all the bodies

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.600
 and stuff.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.440
 That must have been really awkward.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.280
 - Yeah, I'm sure he was very--

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.240
 And actually, 15 years afterwards was around the time

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.320
 they were doing the sugar harvesting.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.680
 And he interviewed dozens of soldiers saying,

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.600
 "Where were you at 7 p.m. on the 18th of June, 1815?"

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.280
 But he really went into detail.

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.360
 And then he assumed the government was gonna pay for it

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.040
 'cause it was his life's work.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.000
 And the government kind of had said we'll pay for it,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.360
 but kind of didn't.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.320
 And Wellington was annoyed 'cause the model had

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.320
 too many Prussians is the theory.

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:33.680
 So he died poor and broke just with this 400-square-foot model

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.720
 of the Battle of Waterloo at 7 p.m.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.560
 - Do we still have it?

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.080
 - It's in the National Army Museum now,

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.080
 which is in Chelsea.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.320
 So it does still exist.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.160
 Yeah, yeah.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.000
 - It's incredible.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.800
 - It's awesome, but it kind of ruined his life.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:44.840
 - Yeah, wow.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.120
 - We should probably say Waterloo happened

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.160
 because Napoleon had been dealt with,

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.640
 defeated by the combined Allied powers,

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.560
 and he'd been sent away to Elba,

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.640
 where he was given, which is a little island off Italy,

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.080
 where he was given command of the island.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.880
 He was also given a small army and navy.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.440
 What are you thinking?

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.400
 This is the best military commander in history.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.880
 He's got a small army and navy.

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:05.720
 He can't possibly--

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.280
 - Who gave that to him, the British?

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.360
 - I don't, I think it was like a sort of Allied decision.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.480
 Like they just said, we'll just, it's fine.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.400
 He'll step down.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.760
 He won't want to come back.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:18.520
 - What a weird, like a desert island disk luxury island.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:19.720
 - Elba is not that far away.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:20.680
 That's the crazy thing.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:21.520
 Like it's quite close.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.360
 I've been there.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.400
 It's quite close to Italy.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.720
 It's really easy to get back.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.680
 So obviously he does a few, like he improves Elba a bit,

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.960
 just sort of fixes it in various ways.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.920
 Then he comes back, like straight back,

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:34.240
 but only with a small army.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.560
 - Only with a small army.

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:37.400
 - And then, so this is in 1815.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.960
 It's called the Hundred Days between him,

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:42.200
 like leaving Elba and getting to where he's eventually defeated

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.800
 because everyone has suddenly scrambled back into action.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.720
 But, and the Bourbon monarchy has been restored.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:47.840
 It's Louis the 18th, I think,

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.320
 who's been put on the throne of France.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.120
 Slightly embarrassing, obviously.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.240
 He's just sort of sidled back onto the throne.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.560
 And as soon as Napoleon lands in France,

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.560
 Louis the 18th sends two big forces led by two marshals

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:02.000
 who like Napoleon's generals were all called marshals.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:02.840
 Sends two marshals.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.040
 As soon as they meet Napoleon, they change sides.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.960
 Like instantly, he just says, look, it's me.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.480
 It's Napoleon, Bonie's back.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.320
 Let's go. - Come on, guys.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.160
 - And they just change sides.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.320
 And he's in charge of France again.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.520
 And the monarchy flees again.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.880
 And then all of Europe has to wake up and scramble and,

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.760
 you know, draw him to Waterloo and try and defeat him.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:24.520
 - And they're basically led by a duo of Wellington and Blucher.

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.200
 And they were really different characters.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.040
 - How are they?

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:31.080
 - So Wellington sounds like a bit of a dick, maybe,

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.280
 to hang out with, but really good general.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.800
 So his forces didn't really love him

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.840
 because he was quite cold, quite arrogant.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:38.880
 - The iron duke.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.360
 - The iron duke, yes.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.320
 You're never going to love someone called the iron duke

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.720
 go to parties with him.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.640
 Whereas Blucher was more very brave,

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.680
 not a good strategist, didn't plan ahead.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.520
 - He was the disco bald duke.

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.840
 - Exactly, yes.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:57.600
 So, and he was called Papa Blucher by his men.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.280
 And they loved and trusted him.

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.000
 But yeah, Wellington quite cocky, apparently.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.560
 - And the interesting thing about Blucher,

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.520
 one of the interesting things is he invented a type of boot.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:08.360
 Didn't he?

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.240
 So just like Wellington did.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.880
 So Wellington had his boot.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:14.200
 - Hang on, that's not his boot, is it?

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.400
 The Wellington boot?

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.240
 - It's named after him.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.080
 Yeah, and he was--

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:17.920
 - But he didn't invent it.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.520
 - Well, yeah, I'm sure he wanted--

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.920
 - He wanted people to have a special kind of boot

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.240
 to go into battle with.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.080
 - Yeah, right, yeah.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.320
 - And it was two boots each.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.160
 - Yeah.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.160
 - One of us had three.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.400
 (all laughing)

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.400
 - And he, yeah, he didn't do the designing

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.200
 or the making of it or anything like that,

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.360
 but it was his idea, I think.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.200
 - Yeah.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.040
 - And there were wellies.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:37.880
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.240
 - They were proper boots.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.880
 - Yeah, it wasn't like a farmer.

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.640
 - Yeah, that's what I'm thinking of, but yeah, yeah.

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.080
 - Imagine squelching into--

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.160
 (all laughing)

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.480
 - Or like some shiny ones,

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.680
 like with rainbows on like you get in Glastonbury.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:49.520
 (all laughing)

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:50.720
 - Napoleon actually lost

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.840
 'cause he wore his kitten heels on the day of the battle

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.440
 and he got stuck in some mud.

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.400
 - So he was in Crocs.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.320
 - Blucher had a boot, too.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.760
 - Yeah, so Wellington had his boot,

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.760
 but they weren't, that hadn't been invented

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.560
 at the Battle of Waterloo, but Blucher's boot had been.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:06.040
 So the Blucher army went in in Blucher's boots,

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.160
 but the Wellington army didn't go out in Wellington boots

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.440
 'cause they hadn't been invented.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.400
 - The idea of generals having their kind of their merch.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:13.240
 - It's a good idea.

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.520
 - You can imagine the final speech

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:15.560
 on the morning of the battle.

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:18.080
 And if you put in the offer code Blucher,

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.640
 you'll get 10 marks off the price of your first pair.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.720
 (all laughing)

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:23.840
 - But no, it was this huge,

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.680
 like it was 200,000 men crammed into about five square miles.

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:28.840
 Like it was a very, very, very deadly battle,

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.520
 like lots of casualties, hence all the bodies.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.400
 I think 50,000 were killed or seriously injured.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.720
 It was really sort of bloody.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.480
 - It took place over about four days.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.480
 Waterloo was on the final day

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:41.640
 and there were three small battles leading up

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:42.960
 to the big final confrontation.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.760
 - And not in Waterloo as well, we should say.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.600
 - No, nearby, yeah.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.560
 - It's like with Roswell, with the alien incident.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:49.400
 - All right.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.480
 - It was because the aliens were brought back to Roswell,

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.320
 it's called Roswell.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.160
 - Oh my gosh.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.440
 - This was the information was sent from Waterloo.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.280
 - I thought it was safe from you.

00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:00.040
 I thought this fact was, like this is a damn proof fact.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.440
 There's no way he's gonna be able to get onto yesterday.

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:05.800
 - So the tripod came down onto the battlefield.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:06.680
 That's interesting.

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:08.480
 So that was where his office was.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.840
 - That's where they were stationed, yeah.

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:12.720
 And basically, as it says, it's like the official report

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.600
 had the date line and the location on it

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.360
 and Waterloo was the location and so forth, yeah.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.200
 - Which was close.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.040
 - It was super close.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:19.880
 - It was super close.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.760
 - Roswell was right next door to Corona, you know.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:23.600
 - Corona?

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:24.440
 - That's where, yeah.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.280
 - What?

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:26.240
 - I know, right?

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.080
 - Get out.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.040
 - No one else has been pushing this conspiracy

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.080
 like I have, so I'm glad we're all aboard.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.560
 - But yes, aliens gave us the Corona virus.

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:34.400
 - Wow.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:39.040
 - This was the end of the Napoleonic War, or was it?

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.000
 There was actually another battle afterwards

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.440
 which France won in the Napoleonic War.

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.280
 So France won the last battle of the Napoleonic War.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:47.120
 - Get out.

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.680
 - The Battle of Wavre.

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.400
 And what happened was it was French reinforcements

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:55.160
 coming to Waterloo and they met up with the Prussians

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.320
 and there was a big battle, but what they didn't realize

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.640
 is the Battle of Waterloo had already finished.

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:03.160
 And so Napoleon had lost, but there was another battle

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.800
 going on to bring reinforcements.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.160
 France won that.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.440
 Brilliant, let's go.

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.400
 Oh, it's finished.

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.480
 - Wow, so that is so interesting.

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.320
 I didn't know that.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.160
 - Yeah.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.080
 - So technically, if you win the last battle of the war,

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.600
 does it mean that you win the whole war?

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.200
 - I reckon if it's like winner stays on.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.120
 - It's last goal wins.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.480
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.520
 - Are we trying to get more Frenchness for this war?

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.200
 It's good, isn't it?

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.360
 - I'm not counting it.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.120
 - Andy, you've probably got a few more minutes.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:26.960
 - Stop, stop, stop.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.680
 - I'll never talk about Waterloo ever again.

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:32.880
 - There are a few Joan of Arc types at Waterloo,

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.160
 a few women, yes.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.440
 They seem to be mostly on the Prussian side actually.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:40.360
 There was a woman called Eleanor Prochaska

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:43.280
 and Friederike, I think she called herself Frederick,

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.200
 wasn't her actual name, Kruger.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.240
 And they just cut their hair.

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:47.240
 - Freddy Kruger.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.080
 (laughing)

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:50.420
 - Did I not?

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:51.260
 - Oh my God.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:52.240
 - Wow.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.600
 - Oh my God.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.440
 - Is that real?

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.840
 - I'm trying to welcome Dan back into the conversation.

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:59.920
 - Yeah, Freddy Kruger, that was where he got famous.

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.080
 - That's so good, 'cause there's also a famous water skier

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:02.920
 called Freddy Kruger.

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:03.760
 - Really?

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:04.600
 - There's this person at the battle.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.480
 We're only one away from an only connect question.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.320
 (laughing)

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.160
 - Oh, wow.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.840
 Well, there you go, Victoria Corrin, if you're listening.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:14.440
 Frederick Kruger cut her hair, went and fought at Waterloo,

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.680
 gave herself away, apparently one account said

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:20.060
 when she spoke in a particularly high voice suddenly.

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:23.520
 - I'll find you in your dreams, I'm coming for you.

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:24.360
 - My God.

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.700
 - Don't go for it.

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:28.280
 (upbeat music)

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:33.760
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.280
 - Okay, my fact this week is that puffer fish

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.720
 don't have a functioning stomach,

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.680
 so they digest food in their rectum.

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:44.640
 Much like President Garfield.

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.040
 - Yes. - Oh, wow.

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:47.000
 - I hadn't made that connection.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 - Or those people on a boat one time, you know,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.400
 who like put food up the bum.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.240
 - Did they?

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.080
 - I don't remember this.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:54.920
 - Do you remember?

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:56.220
 - I don't think Hannah was there.

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:57.880
 - This is one of your yacht parties, isn't it?

00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:59.180
 (all laughing)

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:02.180
 - It was they put turtle blood up their anus.

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:05.740
 - Oh, yes, the shipwrecked family.

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:07.820
 - That's right, the enemas, the total enemas.

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:10.300
 - So we've got President Garfield, those guys,

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:11.640
 the puffer fish were just one away

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:15.540
 from an only connect question, if you're listening, Victoria.

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:17.860
 - So do they like President Garfield

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.740
 put the food up their bums?

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:20.580
 - No, they do not.

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:21.420
 - Okay.

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:24.540
 - Um, puffer fish get the name because they puff up.

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:25.380
 - Yeah.

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:27.200
 - If they're in danger, they make themselves much bigger

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:30.960
 by sucking in a load of water and just becoming a big ball.

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:34.360
 Now, in order to do that, they've lost their stomach

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.200
 because the stomach would get in the way of this skill.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.560
 - You mean evolutionarily or just every time they pop up

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:40.960
 their stomach disappears.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:45.000
 - Evolutionarily or by design from God.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.800
 They have lost their stomach.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:50.080
 And so the way that they eat is they get the food

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:53.160
 into their body and they absorb the nutrients

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.540
 when it's going down their throat,

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:56.060
 when it's going in their intestines

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:58.740
 and also when it's going into their rectum.

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:01.020
 They have enzymes that break down the food.

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:03.860
 They have, you know, they have an acidic mucus

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:05.900
 all the way down the digestive system.

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:07.360
 But the reason that they don't have a stomach

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:09.660
 is to have a stomach you need to have a sphincter

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:12.160
 on either side and it to be a bag.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:13.820
 And they don't have that particular thing.

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:15.180
 - They've only got one sphincter.

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:16.500
 - They only have one sphincter.

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:17.540
 - In that system.

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:19.080
 - And then the mouth is the other one.

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.100
 - It's really interesting when you think, you know,

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:23.600
 we're all just a bag with two sphincters.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.120
 - We are, really.

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:28.000
 Yeah, we're a Chutira stone.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.560
 As in the mouth comes first and then the anus comes

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:32.600
 and then all the other bits come.

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:33.480
 - And there's the tube stuff.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:34.320
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.140
 - There's humbling stuff, isn't it?

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:36.480
 - It is, yeah.

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:38.640
 But they're very, I didn't really, they're awesome.

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:39.480
 I really like puff fish.

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.320
 - Puff fish are awesome.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.160
 - Yeah, they're great.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:42.000
 - That's so cool.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.400
 - They're quite silly, I think.

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:44.320
 - They're very silly.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:45.920
 - I think as a defense mechanism,

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.200
 I think inflating yourself like a balloon rather.

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:51.000
 And I think basically they had to evolve that

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.740
 because they're not very good swimmers.

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:54.980
 And so instead they just puff themselves up to this

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:57.260
 too big to eat, like a comedy animal.

00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:00.180
 - They're the only fish that my daughter can recognize,

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:01.500
 the only species of fish.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:02.340
 - Oh, really?

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:03.180
 - Oh, wow.

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:04.020
 - That's a fact.

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:04.860
 - That's a good fact.

00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:06.260
 - As in if you give her a picture of loads of fish,

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:07.660
 she'll recognize that they're fish,

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.860
 but if puff fish will go puff a fish.

00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:10.700
 Pfft.

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:11.760
 - Oh, nice.

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.900
 - I used to have a puff a fish as a kid as a pet.

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:14.740
 - No.

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:15.580
 - Yeah.

00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:16.420
 - Really?

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:19.300
 - I was dead, but I was given it in Hong Kong on the--

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:20.380
 - Was it inflated?

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:21.680
 - Yeah, it was.

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.840
 It was inflated and a guy had caught it

00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:25.880
 and I went, it was a fishing village in Hong Kong

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:26.840
 and he gave it to me.

00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:27.680
 It was dead.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:28.520
 He gave it to me in a bag.

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.280
 And I brought it home and I kept it in it.

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.800
 We had a fridge for some reason in the hallway

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.280
 of the building that we lived in.

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:36.240
 So it was like on the group staircase.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.920
 So I used to go every day and visit my puff a fish

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:38.760
 and just open it and see it.

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:39.600
 - What the hell?

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:40.800
 - Does it count as a pet if it's dead?

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:44.440
 - I think I, because I visited it, that's how I count it.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:45.960
 I kind of like, yeah.

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.640
 And it's stunk out the whole building.

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.720
 I didn't recognize 'cause I was so used to the smell

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.220
 and no one could locate it

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:52.060
 where the smell was coming from.

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:54.460
 - How could they not locate it if it was in the fridge?

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:56.420
 When someone else opened the fridge, didn't they say?

00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:57.340
 - Well, I guess no one did.

00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:58.340
 No one opened the fridge.

00:17:58.340 --> 00:17:59.180
 - No one ever opened the fridge.

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:00.020
 - 'Cause it was our fridge.

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:00.860
 No one touched our fridge.

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:01.700
 - Right, right, right.

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:03.340
 - So how old were you?

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:04.780
 - I was about eight.

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:06.980
 - So how come your parents opened the fridge, right?

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:09.380
 Did your parents never say, you know what, Dan?

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.460
 I think it's time you threw out this dead puff a fish.

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:12.300
 - They just didn't tell them.

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.300
 So they just didn't know where this thing was coming from.

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:17.140
 - Probably after a while it would have got a load

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:19.540
 of flies and worms and stuff in it, right?

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:20.380
 - It was pretty rotten, yeah.

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:22.980
 - So your parents would have to, after a while go,

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:24.500
 "Dan, I've got bad news.

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:26.240
 Your dead puff a fish is alive."

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.340
 (all laughing)

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:30.220
 - Yeah, so true.

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:32.240
 - Anna, William, I've actually got a puff a fish anecdote.

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.280
 It's not as good as these twos.

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.900
 My daughter can recognize/I used to have a dead pet one.

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:39.220
 But I was at an antiques market a couple of months ago.

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:42.720
 And one of the items on sale there was a puff a fish lamp

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:45.240
 where someone had inflated puff a fish

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:48.100
 and then, I don't know how, got a light bulb into it.

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:51.120
 - Oh, one of the sphinxes probably opened together.

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.300
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:53.340
 But I didn't buy it.

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:54.180
 - Did you not?

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:55.020
 - I don't regret not buying it

00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:56.420
 'cause it was a pretty macabre thing.

00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:57.260
 - Wow, this is amazing.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:58.500
 So Andy's got a puff a fish story.

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:00.220
 You've got one, I've got one.

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:02.580
 If we can get Anna one, we'll have another question.

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:04.660
 (all laughing)

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:06.980
 - This is gonna be the most esoteric episode

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:09.500
 of an already quite esoteric show.

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:11.820
 - All right, tune in for my spin-off documentary.

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:13.860
 Anna finds a puff a fish story.

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:15.140
 - Anna and the blowfish.

00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:16.420
 Is the blowfish the same as a puff a fish?

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:17.580
 - Yes.

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:20.160
 - And they're the same as Fugu.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.420
 - Yeah, I think the Fugu are traditionally dead as well,

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:24.180
 but less rotten than Dan.

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:26.780
 - 'Cause this is one of their defenses, the puffing up,

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:28.020
 but it's not their only defense

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:29.900
 because they're incredibly poisonous.

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:32.260
 - Is it a defense though, if you can't use,

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.180
 they can't shoot their livers out of themselves, right?

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:36.400
 Which is what is most of the toxins.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.220
 - I believe not.

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:38.220
 - Yeah, but it's a defense.

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:39.340
 - The advertiser that you're poisonous

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:40.300
 with what you look like, I suppose.

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:41.540
 - Yeah, okay, right.

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:44.020
 - You know, there's a thing in Japan where,

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:45.260
 so puff a fish and Fugu,

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.100
 there's different species of puff a fish, right?

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:48.900
 I think there's like 200 species

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:50.540
 and they all look a bit different.

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:52.060
 Fugu is a big one in Japan.

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:53.300
 It's a delicacy.

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:55.020
 We all know it to be dangerous,

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:56.580
 if not prepared by the correct chef

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:58.300
 because of all these toxins and poisons.

00:19:58.300 --> 00:19:59.580
 And you do get trained as a chef.

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:00.860
 You've got to be over 20,

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:03.500
 you've got to spend years in an academy doing it.

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:04.820
 - Can I just quickly say?

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:05.660
 You don't.

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:06.980
 - Exactly, this is the problem.

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:08.780
 - It's regionally specific.

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:12.140
 So in some areas of Japan, you have to, as Dan says,

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:13.820
 you do a written test, you do a practical test,

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:15.020
 you do all sorts of stuff.

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:17.260
 Another bit of Japan, just go to a lecture.

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:19.820
 - Yeah, you can do it within an hour.

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:20.980
 - Can you do it on Zoom?

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:21.820
 - Yeah.

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:22.660
 (laughing)

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:23.500
 - You can get a license.

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:25.020
 - 'Cause that'd be great, 'cause you could just watch it

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:27.540
 and then put your camera so no one can see you

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:29.300
 and then you can just go to the pub.

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:32.940
 - Yeah, so chefs keep wanting to have regulations put in place.

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:35.220
 So I read an article, 2009,

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:36.700
 hundreds of people were poisoned

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:39.900
 by badly prepared Fugu, 34 of them died.

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:40.740
 - Wow.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.780
 - Yeah, there was one guy,

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:44.740
 sorry, there was a group of men in Northern Japan

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:47.740
 who, when they ate grilled blowfish testicles,

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:49.980
 found themselves very, very ill

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:51.860
 because of unlicensed chefs.

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:52.700
 - Wow.

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:53.540
 - Yeah.

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:54.380
 - But what?

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:55.220
 - I just realized I've made a mistake.

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:57.740
 That was before the new license system in 2019.

00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:58.580
 - Yeah, so yes.

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:00.300
 - It used to be regionally specific.

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:02.340
 I believe maybe now you can no longer

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:03.740
 just go to the Zoom lecture.

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:05.860
 - And that was for a long time

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:07.860
 and thousands of people were dying.

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:09.020
 - What's wrong with us though?

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:10.980
 It can't, is it curiosity?

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:11.940
 It can't be that good.

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:13.340
 What's wrong with us that we want to eat it?

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:14.180
 - I think it's tasty.

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:15.020
 - It can be that tasty.

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:16.380
 - Gives you a bit of a buzz.

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:18.380
 It makes your mouth tingle.

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:20.340
 - But I think, and the liver's the best bit

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:22.100
 and you're not allowed to eat that, I don't think.

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:22.940
 Odal, are you?

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:24.180
 Even if you're serving Fugu.

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:26.580
 - I think you have to remove the,

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:27.420
 well, it's meant to be.

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:28.820
 - 'Cause they serve, so like in 2011,

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:29.820
 there was a woman in a restaurant

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:31.620
 who specifically said to the chef,

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:32.820
 please give me the liver.

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:34.300
 I know you're not supposed to, but do it.

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:35.740
 And I think they do, so he did.

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:37.260
 And then she ended up going to hospital.

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:39.180
 - And there was a famous actor,

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:41.260
 a Japanese Kabuki theater actor

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:43.420
 called Mitsuguro Bando, the eighth.

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:46.580
 And in 1975, he went to a Fugu restaurant

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:47.980
 and he persuaded one of the chefs

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:50.260
 that he had developed a natural resistance to the toxin.

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:52.100
 He built it up and he asked the chef,

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:54.220
 can you do me some Fugu livers?

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:56.500
 And he got the plate, he ate four Fugu livers,

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:57.340
 then he died.

00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:58.180
 - Yeah, right.

00:21:58.180 --> 00:21:59.020
 - So I don't think he had,

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:00.940
 whether he thought he had built up a resistance or not,

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:01.780
 he hadn't.

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:03.260
 - The other thing is that these days

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:05.820
 you can make harmless Fugu.

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:09.260
 So they get the poison by eating the special bacteria.

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:13.220
 So if you can make your Fugu fish grow up in a place

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:14.660
 where this bacteria doesn't exist,

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:15.860
 then it's not gonna be poisonous.

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:17.260
 - It's amazing. - It's not the same.

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:18.100
 It's not the same.

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:21.460
 - Well, as chefs say, it seems insane.

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:23.940
 We can now breed Fugu that tastes the same,

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:24.780
 but don't poison you.

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:26.780
 And one chef was asked about it and said,

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:27.820
 no, I'm not gonna serve it.

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:29.780
 It's obviously more than a little exciting

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:31.380
 to go to a restaurant knowing it might be

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:33.060
 the last meal you ever eat.

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:34.580
 Where's the enjoyment in eating something

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:35.420
 with no risk in it?

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:37.260
 - Yeah, I completely agree.

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:39.420
 You know how you said it's different regionally

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:43.420
 in some places, in Shimono-Seki area,

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:45.940
 it's not called Fugu, it's called Fuku.

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:47.700
 - Oh. - Whoa.

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:48.660
 - Seems not appropriate.

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:49.500
 - Yeah.

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:50.500
 - 'Cause that's actually your last words

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:51.340
 to the chef when you're done.

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:53.260
 (all laughing)

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:55.460
 I don't think you know that you've been poisoned

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:57.380
 until about 25 minutes later.

00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:58.220
 - Yep.

00:22:58.220 --> 00:22:59.700
 - So I think you've got time to get the bill.

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:00.540
 You have to pay it.

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:02.300
 And then you realize, as you're leaving,

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:03.540
 hang on a second.

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:05.380
 - As someone who's been to a puff fish restaurant,

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:06.980
 they are very quick with the bill.

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:08.900
 (all laughing)

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:10.500
 - So you only had a starter 'cause there was nothing

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:11.980
 that wasn't Fugu on the menu.

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:13.860
 I think I've mentioned this before.

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:15.500
 - And you thought you were gonna have the chicken nuggets

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:16.580
 and they were the testicles?

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:17.900
 - It was the testicles.

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:19.420
 But now that I've heard that the testicles

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:20.660
 are poisonous and killed someone,

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:21.740
 I'm kind of glad that I didn't.

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:23.260
 - They're served separately often.

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:25.580
 They often have like a soul Fugu meal.

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:26.420
 - Yeah. - Right.

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:29.540
 - And it starts off with some sashimi slices.

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:32.860
 So just little raw slices arranged to look like a crane

00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:36.860
 about to take flight, which is a symbol of longevity.

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:38.180
 - How I run it.

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:39.340
 (all laughing)

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:40.620
 - And then you get some Fugu stew,

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:42.300
 Fugu and rice porridge and hot sake

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:45.380
 with grilled Fugu fin in it and the testicles on the side.

00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:47.140
 - And Fugu jelly and Fugu ice cream.

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:47.980
 - Oh, lovely.

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:49.420
 It was the Fugu hundreds of thousands

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:50.700
 and then a Fugu mint.

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:53.060
 (all laughing)

00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:54.700
 - Have you ever tried puffer fish semen,

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:56.460
 which is another delicacy?

00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:57.300
 - Okay.

00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:58.140
 - No.

00:23:58.140 --> 00:23:58.980
 - No.

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:00.820
 - Do you not have mayonnaise with your nuggets?

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:03.140
 (all laughing)

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:04.260
 - Is it poisonous?

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:05.340
 - Probably.

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:06.180
 - I don't have no idea.

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:07.020
 No, I think that--

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:08.940
 - It's milk in the UK, milk on toast.

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:10.300
 - Yeah, it was delicious.

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:11.140
 - What?

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:13.460
 - Milks is a relatively common, not these days.

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:14.300
 - No.

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:15.140
 - Like a hundred years ago

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.300
 in the northeast of England, you would eat milk for sure.

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:18.140
 - Stop it.

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:18.980
 - No, definitely.

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:20.580
 - So I think my mom always eats and then goes,

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:21.980
 it's ridiculous that people don't have this

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:22.940
 every day these days.

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:24.860
 (all laughing)

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:27.420
 - Come by actually, in my testicle in Metro.

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:28.420
 - Come by.

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:30.780
 - You know, Milton Keynes,

00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:34.540
 that was named after the economist Keynes, John Keynes.

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:36.420
 - He was ejaculated on by a fish.

00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:37.260
 (all laughing)

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:39.020
 - And named the town after him.

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:40.620
 - Oh, God.

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:41.700
 - That is torture.

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:43.980
 (all laughing)

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:46.100
 - I feel like we should talk about live pufferfish.

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:46.940
 - Yeah, okay.

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:49.220
 - 'Cause they're quite nice when they're alive

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:50.780
 and they make crop circles.

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:51.620
 - Oh, yes.

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:53.540
 - Which are stunning and worth looking at.

00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:55.380
 And we only realized this recently.

00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:56.220
 So we found these--

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:57.660
 - It's amazing they can get that far in land.

00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:58.500
 It's stunning.

00:24:58.500 --> 00:24:59.340
 (all laughing)

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:01.060
 - Well, there is a theory that the Roswell aliens

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:02.940
 actually were pufferfish.

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:03.780
 - Yeah.

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:05.140
 - Yeah, there's not.

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:07.180
 But they do make these extraordinary,

00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:08.940
 they look like perfect fossils.

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:10.580
 You know, you get the typical--

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:11.420
 - Like ammonites.

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:12.420
 - Like ammonite fossils.

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:14.140
 Yeah, on the floor of the ocean,

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:15.260
 they're perfectly symmetrical.

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:18.420
 They're concentric rings with kind of spokes

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:21.420
 coming out from them and beautiful patterns.

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:23.140
 And they were discovered in 1995

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:24.540
 and no one knew what they were.

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:25.820
 They were just these mysterious things

00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:27.060
 on the floor of the ocean.

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:29.780
 And it was only in 2013 that someone was down there

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:31.900
 doing a dive off the coast of Japan somewhere

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:33.260
 and went, hey, there's this pufferfish

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:36.380
 flapping its fins with the, and making this pattern.

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:37.340
 - Was it a mating thing,

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:38.180
 or is that a different situation?

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:39.020
 - Oh, yeah.

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:39.780
 - Yeah, 'cause there was an amazing answer

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:41.340
 for a piece on it, wasn't it?

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:42.980
 - So the female gets to sit

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:44.780
 in the middle of these concentric circles

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:47.820
 and if she likes it, she gives an egg up

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:48.740
 and he gives a sperm up.

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:51.340
 And in about one second, that's mating done.

00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:52.180
 - Yeah.

00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:53.020
 - And if not, she doesn't.

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:55.260
 - There is one theory that all she cares about

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:56.380
 is how much sand is there.

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:57.220
 - Yeah, right.

00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:58.700
 - And she doesn't care about all these beautiful

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:00.340
 kind of circles and that.

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:02.740
 And the fact is that the circles are a byproduct

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:04.580
 of the fact that you have to do that

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:06.740
 to get all the sand into the middle.

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:08.900
 You just have to do it in a certain order.

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:11.220
 - So is it like, it's like the equivalent of,

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:13.860
 actually, my wife isn't interested in my model railway.

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:15.220
 It's that I've got a nice home,

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:16.860
 which the model railway is in.

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:17.940
 - It's a really good fight.

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:19.340
 Yeah, yeah, that's almost.

00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:20.700
 - Foolish analogy.

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:22.420
 - I've got some questions to ask.

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:24.300
 I've got to go home, actually.

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:26.880
 (upbeat music)

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:31.180
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:32.500
 and that is my fact.

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:35.180
 My fact this week is, as there used to be no way

00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:36.780
 of duplicating a record,

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:39.220
 one of the best selling songs of the 1890s

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:44.220
 had to be recorded over 10,000 times by the same singer.

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:45.140
 - That's amazing.

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:47.100
 - What is air in the recording studio, it must have been.

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:49.940
 - Well, days, eight days, eight days,

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:51.060
 and weeks and months,

00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:53.540
 because basically every single record

00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:56.860
 that you used to make back in the day was a master copy.

00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:57.940
 That's what got sold.

00:26:57.940 --> 00:26:59.660
 There was no way of then recording that

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:01.060
 into being another record.

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:02.420
 In the way that we have now, yeah.

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:04.140
 - So it's quite nice in a way

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:06.260
 because your record's different to everyone else's.

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:07.220
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:08.820
 You literally have a bespoke record.

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:10.380
 - If there's a little fart in the background,

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:11.300
 that's just for you.

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:13.820
 - Yeah, so there were no mics or no amplifiers.

00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:17.180
 You had to just yell into the horn of the phonograph.

00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:19.540
 And if you were particularly wealthy,

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:22.100
 you were able to get four or five horns around you.

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:25.900
 And so you could make up to five copies of a single song.

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:30.860
 So it's thought that the best selling single of the 1890s

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:33.140
 was sung by a guy who was an African-American

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:36.020
 called George Washington Johnson.

00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:38.260
 And he was a street singer on the New York streets.

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:39.580
 He was just doing it for pennies.

00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:41.580
 And he used to sing a couple of songs

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:43.660
 which were very, very backward and racist.

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:45.540
 And I think that's why people didn't mind

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:48.780
 a black singer being that well distributed.

00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:50.940
 It was called, you know, one was, what were they called?

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:52.060
 - You don't need to read that out.

00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:52.900
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:54.100
 - They did some lyrics.

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:55.180
 Yeah.

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:56.420
 No, but there was a lot of,

00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:58.740
 it was a lot of taking himself down within the song.

00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:01.420
 But one of the songs, which was the laughing song,

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:03.180
 that was the biggest song of the time.

00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:05.300
 It sold 50,000 copies.

00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:07.820
 So it said that he did copies

00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:11.380
 that were like four to five horns in one go.

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:12.580
 And it sold 50,000.

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:15.060
 So at minimum, he sang it 10,000 times.

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:15.900
 - Amazing.

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:17.420
 - But it was probably more than, yeah.

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:19.420
 - Was the laughing song just laughing?

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:20.780
 - No, that was the chorus.

00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:22.460
 - So people might know it actually.

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:24.660
 I reckon people listen to this, some of them will know it

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:27.220
 because it was covered loads of times,

00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:31.700
 especially in the UK, a slightly different version called "The Laughing Policeman" song.

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:33.860
 - Oh yeah! - Which I love as a child.

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:35.060
 - Me too! - Well, it's exactly the same.

00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:38.660
 It's the same song, but obviously they removed all of the racist stuff

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:47.460
 and replaced it with a fat policeman who goes, "Wah! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha."

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:49.460
 And that's the song. - It's great. - Yeah.

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:58.580
 - But when I was reading about this, I thought, "How... I can't believe the things that entertained people in the 1890s, and now you're right. We found that very entertaining in our childhood. Good on him."

00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:09.220
 - Yeah, Johnson, George Washington Johnson, he had quite a sad end because they worked out how to replicate music, and he no longer had a job for life, basically.

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:11.380
 - Yeah, because there were no royalties. - No, exactly.

00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:17.780
 - So you got paid for doing your recording, but once they managed to just copy stuff, then you'd never got any money anymore.

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:20.900
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Like Spotify of its day. - Yeah.

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:47.460
 - Ooh, controversial for our largest distribution outlet. - Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. - Yeah, he had a... He had a... The middle bit where he was singing the song might have been the only kind of peaceful bit of his life, really, because he was born in 1846 into slavery. He was made to be the best friend of the child of the family, so he sort of had...

00:29:47.780 --> 00:30:16.460
 - The playmate thing for the white family. - Yeah, so he then was freed, and he went to New York, where he lived in Hell's Kitchen, and he was doing all this stuff where he was sort of, you know, on the street singing. Then this big moment happens where he gets to sing all these songs, as James points out, then they work out how to duplicate it. So his career is dead after, you know, sitting in a booth 20,000 times, minimum, singing this stuff. And then life gets really weird for him, as Andy points out. He was charged with murder. He was never convicted, but he was brought onto it.

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:17.900
 - Yeah. - He was brought onto him.

00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:37.420
 - Both of his wives died suddenly when living with him, and yeah, he was charged with trying to murder one of them, well, actually murdering one of them. I did read a report of an altercation he had with his wife, and this was in the Earth newspaper in 1899, and its headline was "Too Much Whistling," because his main thing was whistling, right?

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:46.420
 - Yeah. - And he was famous on the streets of New York for whistling. And it said, "George Rottington Johnson is in trouble," because he couldn't restrain his disposition to whistle at all times.

00:30:47.380 --> 00:31:01.380
 He crawled with his wife, because she got tired of him whistling all over the house, so she shot him, and he thumped her, and died the next night. So that was a story in what I assume was a tabloid equivalent. He whistled too much. She shot him. He hit her.

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:03.380
 - And then she died. - And then she died.

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:07.380
 - Right. - In the olden days, you could just make a living from being really good at whistling.

00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:11.380
 - I was just thinking that. - Yeah, but you don't have to code or anything. - No.

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:26.380
 - You could just whistle. - There was a guy called Freeman Davis, who was known as Brother Bones, who was a shoeshine boy, and people noticed how good he was at whistling. And he would also play his shoeshine instruments, like the spoons you might do.

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:31.380
 And he became really famous, and his whistling became the theme song of the Harlem Club Trotters.

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:45.380
 There was Sibyl Sanderson Fagan, who was one of the most famous whistlers in America in the 1920s, and she would do whistling of birdsong, so you would buy a vinyl and it would just be her pretending to be a thrush or a mockingbird or something.

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:57.380
 She left her husband, who was a playwright called Eugene P. Bardin, because she claimed that he had drugged her on her wedding day. And so she got married because she said that she'd been drugged into getting married.

00:31:57.380 --> 00:32:02.380
 - He drugged her into the marriage? I thought he meant after the wedding had happened, then he drugged her. Oh my goodness.

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:15.380
 - There was Fred Lowry, who was a professional whistler in the 40s and 50s, who was blinded by Scala Fever at the age of two, then became a whistler, and then he later went away from pop music and became a religious whistler.

00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:22.380
 - Oh, religious whistler. - Yeah, he would go to churches and whistle hymns instead of whistling pop songs. - Nice.

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:30.380
 - But yeah, it's just amazing that you've got all these people who, all they could do was whistle. I'm not all we could do is podcast, so it's... - Exactly, yeah, yeah.

00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:38.380
 - I can whistle. - Oh yeah? Let's hear your thrush. - Oh my thrush. Oh shit, I've got thrush.

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:45.380
 - Well, there wasn't the first Eurovision. The Half Time Act was a troop of whistlers called the Rossignols, I think, yeah.

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:50.380
 - Oh, that means Nightingale in French. - Oh, there we go. Okay, well, that is all coming together.

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:58.380
 - Yeah, yeah, so it's a big deal. - If you say in French "J'ai les Rossignols", which I think means "I have Rossignols",

00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:04.380
 it means there's a problem with your car, because it's like you have Nightingales in your engine and it's making a weird tweeting noise.

00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:12.380
 - Nice. - The earliest sound recording we have, we actually only heard a few years ago, but it was from way earlier than we thought.

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:22.380
 It was like 20 years before Edison in 1857, and it was a French guy called Edouard-Léon Scott de Matam V, and he basically recorded sound,

00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:30.380
 but he didn't know how to play it back. He hadn't invented the instrument to transmit it in, so he just recorded it onto a bit of paper.

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:37.380
 - That takes a lot of trust when you go to the dragons. Not honestly, I have recorded sound, just can't hear it. It's fine.

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:45.380
 - You can show them the paper and give it, this would sound amazing if you try to imagine it, and we managed to engineer it in 2008 to play.

00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:49.380
 - Wow, his piece of paper. - His piece of paper is 1860 piece of paper.

00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:55.380
 - Indicated. - Yeah, it was covered in soot and the sound waves were etched in.

00:33:55.380 --> 00:34:13.380
 - Vinyl is PVC, and that was invented or first synthesized by a guy, a German chemist called Eugene Bauman in 1872, and he had been making some vinyl chloride in a flask and had just left it on a shelf for a few days,

00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:21.380
 maybe a few weeks, the sunlight had got on it, and then there was a white compound in there, and he thought, I wonder what this is, and that turned out to be PVC.

00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:37.380
 - Wow. - Did he then stick his arm in the flask to try and get it out, and it formed a sexy PVC glove, and he realized this has huge implications for the erotic clothing industry.

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:53.380
 - Well, that is the story, that's really what happened. Eugene Bauman also identified the sauce for the smells in urine, and proved the active ingredients in your thyroid gland, which is what stops you from getting goiters.

00:34:53.380 --> 00:35:01.380
 - Oh. - So just a few things about him. - Wow, what a range. - It's all chemistry. - What do you lead with, though? - On the CV.

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:15.380
 - Oh, I know why Pee smells, I know why Piss smells. - If you're sat next to someone at a wedding, and they say, what do you do? You say, I'm a chemist, and they go, oh, have you chemisted anything that I might know, then what is for a smell?

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:25.380
 - Have you ever smelled some piss? I know why. - Your best man is very rude. - Oh, dear.

00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:35.380
 - I don't think we've ever mentioned Chichester Bell before, because I didn't know about him anyway. - Is that person? - He's Alexander Graham Bell's brother. - Stop it.

00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:54.380
 - Really? - He's also a phonograph pioneer. - Chichester Bell, what a name. - He invented the earliest voicemail. Round about the time his brother, Alex, was working on phones. Yeah, he invented voicemail, and the way it worked was, it was a phonograph cylinder that you recorded your voice onto.

00:35:54.380 --> 00:36:15.380
 - So the grooves are all in the right place, and then you just posted it to your friend. - The problem is that they would get it, and they'd be like, oh, who's it from? And they go, Chichester Bell, and they go, fuck off. That's just spam, mate.

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:20.380
 - OK, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Anna.

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:27.380
 - My fact this week is that the US government maintains a database of dad jokes.

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:34.380
 - What an excellent fact. - There we are, we're off the blocks again. - There we go.

00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:42.380
 - Three guys absolutely straining for a dad joke there. - I don't know why I presented this fact, because there's promises to be held in the next 20 minutes with you guys.

00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:57.380
 But this is on a website that's run by the Office of Family Assistance, which is a government resource for fathers, basically, for families, and they have a website within that called the National Responsible Fatherhood Clearinghouse.

00:36:57.380 --> 00:37:10.380
 And if you go to that website, which I would recommend, then you can click on dad resources, and you can submit your own dad jokes, and you can click, give me a joke, and they'll give you a dad joke.

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:14.380
 You can click, give me another, they'll give you another. I don't know how long it goes on for, or I sat there for about half an hour.

00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:23.380
 - If you go to the mum section of this website, is it all practical stuff? Like how to feed a baby, how to change a baby, how to keep a baby alive.

00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:29.380
 - It's a load of your mum jokes.

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:38.380
 - And yeah, I thought that was really interesting. And I guess the idea is that being a father is perhaps something people need help with, of course, as they do with all the bits of parenting.

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:47.380
 And it's a useful skill to have in your back pocket as a dad, being able to whip out a really bad, really inoffensive joke, which seems to basically be the definition is that they're bad and they're not offensive.

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:55.380
 - Yeah, so they give you a bunch of the jokes with the reveals on the site. All right, so here's the first one that came up that I saw. What do you call a man with a rubber toe?

00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:57.380
 - Ah, Roberto.

00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:59.380
 - Roberto, yes.

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:13.380
 - I don't think that's a dad joke, actually. I would say, so my definition of a dad joke is a joke where it is in response to something a child often says, and you always repeat it all the time, all the time, all the time.

00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:21.380
 So for instance, Anna's mum joke, which is, can you turn on the light and then your mum goes and flirts with the light and she's like, are you turned on yet?

00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:22.380
 - Yes.

00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:25.380
 - I think that's a dad joke because it's something that kids will always say.

00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:34.380
 - I have an actual dad joke that I do, and I've been doing for six years now, every single time it's said, and it's whenever it's kind of getting to the evening and Fenella says, can you draw the curtains?

00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:35.380
 - Okay.

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:36.380
 - I always say.

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:37.380
 - Can I have a pencil?

00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:40.380
 - I'd love to, but I don't have a pencil.

00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:42.380
 - Yeah, that's a dad joke, I think.

00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:56.380
 - Interesting, I think they're two strounds of dad-jokism, which is a complex being, I agree that is one, but then I think, I remember, you know, my dad's whole jokes and they seem to very much fall into the dad-joke category of what does a dog call the thing on top of a house?

00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:57.380
 - Ruff.

00:38:57.380 --> 00:38:59.380
 - Would he regularly say it?

00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:03.380
 - Yeah, I think these are things that you regularly say.

00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:05.380
 - I kind of feel like they're more cracker jokes, like Christmas cracker jokes.

00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:11.380
 - Well, there's a thin line, there's a really nice theory about why dad jokes are good. This is great.

00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:12.380
 - Why, they're good?

00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:15.380
 - Well, no, not, sorry, why they happen.

00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:17.380
 - They are good.

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:20.380
 - Well, no, I mean your one about the curtains was amazing.

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:21.380
 - Another pencil, please.

00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:22.380
 - Brilliant.

00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:23.380
 - Gets a laugh every time.

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:28.380
 - So the idea is that, this is from the British Psychological Society. I personally, I'm not sure I buy it, but I like it.

00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:36.380
 It's that by continually telling their children jokes that are so bad they're embarrassing, fathers may be pushing their children's limits of how much embarrassment they can handle.

00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:38.380
 - That's great.

00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:42.380
 - Showing your child that embarrassment isn't fatal because the child is mortified here.

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:50.380
 And if you're, you know, your child is adolescent, which feels again a bit like the ship has sailed in terms of, you know, dad jokes normally when a child is five or five.

00:39:50.380 --> 00:40:01.380
 But there's a, the sort of theory builds because the theory is if your child has been exposed to years of awful jokes by this point and has shown that dad can cope with people not caring that people think dad is an idiot,

00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:04.380
 the children will be able to be themselves better.

00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:05.380
 - How interesting.

00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:08.380
 - But it's more for the benefit of the dad.

00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:14.380
 - I don't know. I feel like, well, James, I feel like you wrote this up in a book for one of the QI books.

00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:18.380
 - I did, yeah, QI books. So I read quite a few theories, that one included.

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:27.380
 Another one about why they happen is when you have a kid who's two years old, like I do almost, basically they'll laugh at anything, like literally anything.

00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:35.380
 If I say to my daughter, like she wants to read Mogg, and I say, do you want to read Moog? She will piss herself laughing.

00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:39.380
 And then if I'm like, oh, do you want to read the very hurri-coud-de-poudre?

00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:41.380
 She'll just find it the funniest thing in the world, right?

00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:42.380
 And the idea being-

00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:44.380
 - You're making her racist against buildings.

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:48.380
 - I'm still not over water leaving.

00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:49.380
 - It's very true.

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:53.380
 - The thing is, the kids will laugh at almost anything.

00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:59.380
 And then as a dad, that kind of builds your confidence. And then as you get older, you're like, this idiot will laugh at everything.

00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:02.380
 And she always laughed at whatever I said, Moog instead of Mogg.

00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:05.380
 So I'm going to keep doing it. And you just keep doing it and keep doing it.

00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:08.380
 And then as the kids get older, they realize this isn't funny at all.

00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:11.380
 And that's when they realize that they're dad jokes.

00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:15.380
 - Wow. Does the dadness of the joke depend on the child understanding it's not funny?

00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:19.380
 - I think someone has to be on the outside knowing that it's not funny. It might be my wife.

00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:26.380
 - She would know it's a dad joke. But the other thing is like quite often they're kind of wordplay-ish.

00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:31.380
 And there's a theory that by doing this wordplay again and again and again, it helps to teach language skills.

00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:32.380
 - Yeah.

00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:33.380
 - I'll buy that.

00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:34.380
 - Yeah, exactly that.

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:40.380
 And I think also it teaches them a joke structure and it just brings funniness to the house.

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:43.380
 It's just a great way to keep things funny in the house.

00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:45.380
 - I still think that I really like them. I'm very fond of them.

00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:48.380
 I think by definition, a dad joke isn't funny.

00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:50.380
 That's what it is. It's a joke that's kind of predictable.

00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:53.380
 So I read an article by a linguist about dad jokes.

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:57.380
 And I thought the example that she used was not a dad joke for me because I thought it was actually funny.

00:41:57.380 --> 00:41:59.380
 - It wasn't the Bunga Bunga one, was it?

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:04.380
 We can't have that again. The left is the last time.

00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:07.380
 - Oh, it's privately inoffensive, okay? It doesn't cross that boundary.

00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:13.380
 But the joke is that a man comes up to a widow at the funeral of his old friend and he says to the widow,

00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:18.380
 "Do you mind if I say a word?" And she nods and the man clears his throat and says gently,

00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:22.380
 "Plethora." And the wife smiles sadly and replies,

00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:24.380
 "Thanks. That means a lot."

00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:26.380
 - I think that's a very good joke.

00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:29.380
 - It's a good joke. It's too good. It's too good.

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:31.380
 - Can I give you some examples of dad jokes?

00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:37.380
 When I was writing this article for the QI book, I asked my followers on Twitter for some dad jokes.

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:42.380
 So I'll give you the kid saying something and you have to say what the dad says as a joke.

00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:44.380
 - Oh, yeah, okay.

00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:48.380
 - So Adam Sear said that he would say, "Are you all right, dad?"

00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:52.380
 - No, I've got a left-hand side as well.

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:54.380
 - No, I'm half left.

00:42:54.380 --> 00:43:00.380
 - Chris Emerson, our friend Chris Emerson, said he would say to his dad, "I'm off."

00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:02.380
 - Off what?

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:04.380
 - Off com.

00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:08.380
 - And the dad would reply, "I wondered what that smell was."

00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:10.380
 - Oh, that's good.

00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:14.380
 - And Cardinal Grumpy, I think perhaps not his real name.

00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:18.380
 - Senior prelate in the Catholic Church.

00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:22.380
 - If they said, "I'm thirsty," so their dad, what would be the reply?

00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:24.380
 - I'm dad. Nice to meet you.

00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:25.380
 - Pretty close.

00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:27.380
 - Oh, no, it's Wednesday.

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:28.380
 - Oh, put them together.

00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:31.380
 - Hi, I'm Wednesday. Chased the date.

00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:34.380
 - Friday. No, you're not. You're Friday.

00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:36.380
 - You're pretty much that. Who else is Friday?

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:40.380
 Okay, I'm going to give it you. So he says, "Dad, I'm thirsty."

00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:45.380
 Dad says, "Please to meet you Thursday. I'm Friday, and he's Robin St. Crusoe."

00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:46.380
 - Oh.

00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:49.380
 - Wow, that's a really well-read kid.

00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:53.380
 - Do you want to hear one of the first-ever "Your Mum" jokes?

00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:54.380
 - Yeah, go on.

00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:56.380
 - Was it like Babylonian? Is it like as far back as that?

00:43:56.380 --> 00:44:03.380
 - There is one, and it's from a partial bit of text.

00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:07.380
 - So it's not really clear what the entire joke is.

00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:08.380
 - Right.

00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:13.380
 - But there is another one from 100AD, which is Rabbi Eliezer,

00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:17.380
 was said to have gone and interrupted a man who had been reading a banned text,

00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:20.380
 which was Ezekiel 23, by asking him,

00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:25.380
 "Why don't you go out and proclaim the abominations of your mother?"

00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:27.380
 - Is that a "Your Mum" joke?

00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:28.380
 - It's a prototype.

00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:30.380
 - Yeah, absolutely a "Your Mum" joke.

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:34.380
 - Did you find it extremely funny? Judging by the look on your face.

00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:37.380
 - The sad thing is, I'm afraid, for the listeners,

00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:40.380
 is that you'll all now remember all of these really bad jokes that we've told,

00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:42.380
 more than you remember a good joke,

00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:45.380
 because studies show that you remember bad jokes more than good jokes

00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:48.380
 because of the way they work, because they are predictable.

00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:52.380
 The reason that we can kind of guess the endings to the dad jokes that James asked for

00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:56.380
 is that they are formulaic, good for teaching kids how these patterns work,

00:44:56.380 --> 00:45:00.380
 but the definition of good humor that makes you actually laugh is that you subvert that,

00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:02.380
 like pull the rug out from under someone's feet.

00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:04.380
 It's unexpected. So you never remember them.

00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:07.380
 So it's so annoying. You'll only ever remember shit jokes.

00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:09.380
 - So it's like, are you all right, dad?

00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:11.380
 No, I have a terrible, incurable disease,

00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:14.380
 and I won't be with you in a week's time.

00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:18.380
 You got that from the new Ricky Gervais special, didn't you?

00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:21.380
 That subverts the non.

00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:23.380
 - It does. I think it does still have to be funny.

00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:25.380
 - All right, OK.

00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:27.380
 They exist in other languages.

00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:31.380
 In France, as a child, if you say what, what, what, what,

00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:33.380
 they wouldn't understand you because they're French.

00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:36.380
 But if they say it in French, they say "quoi".

00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:40.380
 And any self-respecting dad will reply "foi",

00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:44.380
 "quoi", "foi", "foi", "foi", which means hairdresser, "quoi", "foi".

00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:48.380
 And in Spain, if a dad sees some soy milk,

00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:51.380
 he might say "holla milk, soy papi".

00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:53.380
 - Lovely. - Yes, very good.

00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:56.380
 Because "soy" means "I am", so it means "hi, milk", "I'm dad".

00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:58.380
 - Nice, very nice. - Very nice.

00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:01.380
 That's the "I'm hungry, hi, hungry, I'm dad"

00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:05.380
 is in nine states of America the most ticked as used dad joke.

00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:07.380
 - Oh, nice. - That's a proper dad joke.

00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:09.380
 OK, this is like the parenting test you get

00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:12.380
 after your kid's one or something, you're back to the GP.

00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:14.380
 Please check this box. Can they walk? Can they talk?

00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:17.380
 How many times have you told this joke?

00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:19.380
 I nearly got got researching this fact.

00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:23.380
 It was a report on NPR, obviously really well-respected radio station

00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:25.380
 and great source of lots of stuff.

00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:28.380
 And it was about a list of Roman jokes,

00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:31.380
 ancient Roman jokes that have been found.

00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:34.380
 And it was a scroll found in an amphitheatre

00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:37.380
 and they'd done some amazing analysis.

00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:39.380
 You know the X-ray of scroll and they managed

00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:42.380
 without unrolling it to scan what's inside.

00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:44.380
 And it was all these phrases found in Latin

00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:47.380
 and like a translation was, "Did you hear the rumour about butter?"

00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:49.380
 "Oh, well, I'm not going to spread it."

00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:52.380
 I thought you were going to say, "Butter? I hardly knew her."

00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:57.380
 It was a bit more PG than that, this scroll.

00:46:57.380 --> 00:47:00.380
 And then I got really far into this article

00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:03.380
 and then eventually I got to the claim that Caesar had turned up

00:47:03.380 --> 00:47:06.380
 and addressed a crowd of senators who were angry with him

00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:09.380
 by asking them, "What did the cucumber say to the pickle?"

00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:12.380
 And I realised, I looked at the day, it was an April the first article.

00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:14.380
 And what did he say?

00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:16.380
 "You mean a great deal to me."

00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:18.380
 "Oh, good grief."

00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:20.380
 "Why are you getting your knives out?"

00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:25.380
 So he did deserve it after all.

00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:28.380
 It is weird that these exist all around the world though,

00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:30.380
 this stereotype, or in so many different countries.

00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:34.380
 Like Japan has old man jokes, which are oyaji,

00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:36.380
 old man, then gyagu joke.

00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:38.380
 -Gyagu, like gag? -Yeah, like gag.

00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:41.380
 That's how they make a lot of words in Japanese,

00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:43.380
 don't they? They take an English word.

00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:45.380
 So at the end, in Japanese,

00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:47.380
 every word has to end with a vowel or an N.

00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:50.380
 Like very new, yeah, so it's like a new word.

00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:54.380
 T-shirt too, is T-shirt.

00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:56.380
 Okay, very easy to guess.

00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:58.380
 This is like an extremely easy test.

00:47:58.380 --> 00:48:00.380
 It's not much of a quiz, is it?

00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:03.380
 Korea, they have middle-aged man jokes,

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:05.380
 literally middle-aged man jokes.

00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:07.380
 Danish has various different versions.

00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:09.380
 They've got uncle humor, onkel humor.

00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:15.380
 I would say we've been advertising Babel for quite a long time,

00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:19.380
 but it seems like you could just say words slightly

00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:21.380
 in an accent, and that works.

00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:23.380
 What's the Danish one though?

00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:25.380
 Because my step-grandfather's Danish,

00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:27.380
 and he always used to do whatever their version is.

00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:29.380
 Oh, well, uncle humor is onkel humor,

00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:32.380
 but for him, I think he would be more far vittagede,

00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:34.380
 which is grandfather humor.

00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:36.380
 Father humor, so at the end of every meal,

00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:38.380
 whenever the waiter came over to get our plates,

00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:39.380
 they'd say, "Are you finished?"

00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:41.380
 And he'd say, "No, I'm Danish."

00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:43.380
 Wow, that is very good.

00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:46.380
 Would you like some water? No, fish fucking it.

00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:48.380
 I was a bit young for that, I was eight.

00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:51.380
 That's a WC Fields joke, isn't it?

00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:53.380
 Yeah, that's all right.

00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:55.380
 Guys, do you know what a BJ joke is?

00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:58.380
 Dude, yeah, I do.

00:48:58.380 --> 00:49:00.380
 I don't think you do.

00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:04.380
 BJ joke, so what could it be?

00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:07.380
 Boris Johnson?

00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:09.380
 Yeah, it is technically one of those as well, I suppose.

00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:11.380
 Just shot for bad joke?

00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:13.380
 It's one of those, it's none of those.

00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:15.380
 This is in one study, at least,

00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:18.380
 which seemed to use the officially accepted academic terms for jokes.

00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:21.380
 This is a 2016 study, because I was looking at whether men and women

00:49:21.380 --> 00:49:23.380
 do find different jokes funny,

00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:27.380
 because it's such a gender-based concept, the dad joke.

00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:29.380
 And so there's a study that looked at whether they did,

00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:33.380
 and they divided jokes into EJs, AJs and BJs, which are...

00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:35.380
 Excellent adequate in bed.

00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:37.380
 It should be that.

00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:40.380
 It's exaggeration jokes, ambiguity jokes,

00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:42.380
 and bridging inference jokes.

00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:44.380
 And so BJs are the bridging inference,

00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:48.380
 and that basically means that they require you to actually get the joke.

00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:51.380
 So when you listen to the joke, you have to attribute an intention to another.

00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:53.380
 So an example would be,

00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:57.380
 Jack's dream of becoming a writer comes true when his books finally publish.

00:49:57.380 --> 00:50:00.380
 He asks his friend, "Have you read my book yet?"

00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:02.380
 His friend said, "Yes, and I bought one."

00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:05.380
 And Jack happily responded, "Oh, that was you!"

00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:07.380
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, right.

00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:10.380
 Yeah, it's kind of a bad joke that we've sort of all made about the rest books.

00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:12.380
 That's how you tell them.

00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:14.380
 You really didn't sell that one at all.

00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:18.380
 I think even Will would have been like, "I'm sorry, auntie Anna, no."

00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:20.380
 It wasn't good, was it? I'm sorry.

00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:22.380
 Why is that a BJ?

00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:26.380
 Because we're inferring from the joke that he doesn't sell many of his books.

00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:27.380
 That he's only told one.

00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:29.380
 And you so thankfully gave him a blowjob.

00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:34.380
 You did that with every book that you sold.

00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:36.380
 Didn't you? 10,000 blowjabs.

00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:38.380
 A bit like George Washington Johnson.

00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:42.380
 You could do five at the same time. That's the impressive thing.

00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:54.380
 OK, that's it. That is all of our facts.

00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:55.380
 Thank you so much for listening.
