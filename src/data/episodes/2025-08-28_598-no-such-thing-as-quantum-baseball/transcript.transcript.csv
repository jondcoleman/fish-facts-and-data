00:02:20,00:02:24,"Hi everybody, welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish"
00:02:24,00:02:27,This is one of our audience facts specials when we're going to talk about your facts
00:02:27,00:02:29,My name is Andrew Hunter Murray
00:02:29,00:02:34,I'm here in the qi offices in Hoban with Dan tribe at Anna Tashinsky and James Harkin
00:02:34,00:02:36,We have gathered around the table with
00:02:36,00:02:38,three months worth of
00:02:38,00:02:40,crisp fresh hot
00:02:40,00:02:45,good audience facts and we're going to be sharing them with you and
00:02:46,00:02:53,We've had some cracking stuff in the inbox as we always do we have a new circulated round to the three of us the choicest cuts
00:02:53,00:03:00,"Absolutely, but I haven't verified the stuff. I've sent you or done any extra research"
00:03:00,00:03:03,This is mostly audience emails without that filtration system
00:03:03,00:03:08,"Well, you never know we might have verified or done extra research depends how diligent we are"
00:03:08,00:03:16,Also listener listen out to what we're all saying and work out for yourselves if Andy has kept the choicest cuts to himself
00:03:16,00:03:21,"Yeah, why don't you give us a fact to start off with Andy? Okay. Here's here's a fun one"
00:03:21,00:03:28,This is from Pete Nissen who says a computer engineer for the astronomy department at a prestigious US university
00:03:28,00:03:31,"Sorry, that's who he is"
00:03:31,00:03:38,Works we've got the answer if he's kept the choices cuts
00:03:38,00:03:45,Pete Pete works at a prestigious US University and as a computer engineer for the astronomy department
00:03:45,00:03:50,He says every single faculty member firmly believes that alien life probably exists
00:03:50,00:03:54,But the distances are too big and the laws of physics too rated for aliens to ever visit earth
00:03:54,00:04:01,"Yeah, that's what I think as well. Okay, however, I've recently come into possession of hard evidence that contradicts this"
00:04:01,00:04:12,"I'm so annoyed that I put my cards on the tables anyway, so here's Pete's evidence the first"
00:04:13,00:04:19,Human in quotes to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong. I agree with that. Okay
00:04:19,00:04:22,"James. Oh, you've done it again"
00:04:22,00:04:26,Neil Armstrong spelled backwards is
00:04:26,00:04:29,"Oh, yeah, it's mr. Alien"
00:04:29,00:04:34,"That's right apart from that word gnawts, which doesn't mean anything in our languages"
00:04:34,00:04:40,Mr. Alien is is irrefutable proof as Pete calls it and he's going to be presenting that at the next faculty meeting
00:04:40,00:04:44,I've got to say I'm quite glad that I put my cards on the table nice and early now
00:04:44,00:04:52,Sounds like damn was well-versed in this age old alien backwards. We heard that one. I knew Neil a is alien backwards
00:04:52,00:04:56,"Yeah, I didn't have people talked about that before is this all over there. Yeah. Yeah, that's a big thing"
00:04:56,00:05:00,"I but it's not used in terms of a conspiracy theory. It's just used as like oh, what a nice coincidence like"
00:05:00,00:05:03,Buzz Aldrin's mother's maiden name was moon. Yeah
00:05:06,00:05:10,"One Michael Collins, yes, probably can do something with that dude at home"
00:05:10,00:05:18,snilock I read a while ago that the reason we haven't had aliens here yet is because any
00:05:18,00:05:26,Civilization that can travel throughout a space will necessarily have also created technology that can wipe itself out
00:05:26,00:05:31,"Yeah, interesting and then there's another theory which is that we always talk about the distance of space"
00:05:31,00:05:37,But we sometimes forget how much time there has been since the beginning of the universe
00:05:37,00:05:39,So you might have had a civilization
00:05:39,00:05:44,They got to where we've got to ready to go out space-faring and then as James says they wipe themselves out
00:05:44,00:05:49,We've just lived two billion years distant from them when they were active and they were ready and they were sending
00:05:49,00:05:53,So it's like a rom-com sort of meet cute missing out on each other
00:05:53,00:05:57,"Yeah, exactly Michael Collins does contain all the letters of the word alien just so you know"
00:05:57,00:06:00,I wondered why you weren't paying attention when I said all that stuff
00:06:00,00:06:07,"Also cock mills alien cock mills. So okay, that's interesting. Are they making bread out of them?"
00:06:07,00:06:12,My research hasn't revealed that yet. Wow. I'll do some more anagrams and work it out. Let's have another fact
00:06:12,00:06:24,"Okay, this one is from Jorge Murillo or George Murillo and they say that 10 million people in South America can understand Jabba the Hutt"
00:06:26,00:06:32,That's so interesting. I assume that was a made-up language. So has it been a language that's been adopted
00:06:32,00:06:38,It's a made-up language called hutties and it's in Star Wars of course for anyone doesn't know Star Wars
00:06:38,00:06:44,But it was invented by it was based on a language called quetua
00:06:44,00:06:50,Which is spoken in South America and there is enough words in quetua that if you're
00:06:50,00:06:56,Well-versed in that language you can listen to Star Wars and you pick little bits up. That's so good
00:06:56,00:07:00,So it's like a dialect. I guess so or it's a bit like a Portuguese person in Spain
00:07:00,00:07:07,Can sort of piece a lot of it together maybe yes a bit like that a bit like how if we hear sort of a Dutch person talking
00:07:07,00:07:10,"We can kind of pick up bits of it, but it's a different language. I have no idea"
00:07:10,00:07:21,Some of the words from quetua in English alpaca condor guano Lima has in the beans
00:07:21,00:07:26,"It's all quite that part of the world related stuff, isn't it? They haven't given us the word for chow main"
00:07:26,00:07:40,There's quite a few quetua languages as in there it's like a language group and one of them is called the wanker language
00:07:40,00:07:49,"Feels like your bonus research it does yeah, that's from my own files because I actually I was there in South America a while ago"
00:07:49,00:07:53,And I bought a football jersey from the team the party for wanker
00:07:53,00:08:00,These people I thought you're gonna say and I kept hearing people call
00:08:00,00:08:05,Your guy told you nurse so local language
00:08:05,00:08:08,Did always say something about his grandparents?
00:08:08,00:08:10,He said that they were having lunch one day
00:08:10,00:08:16,He and his sister and his family and they got to a bit where and the reason I didn't read this out is because these are people
00:08:16,00:08:20,I'd never heard of grido holds hands solo at gunpoint and
00:08:20,00:08:26,Almost immediately they kind of looked at each other because they recognized what they were saying as crazy. Isn't that crazy?
00:08:26,00:08:31,"That's amazing, you know I'm Star Wars. I read about the other day"
00:08:31,00:08:36,So the planet where Obi-Wan Kenobi comes from do you know what it's called? I thought it was called Tatooine
00:08:36,00:08:39,"No, so that's where he was based. That's where he lived"
00:08:42,00:08:45,It's a crossover we didn't know existed. It's called Stu John
00:08:45,00:08:50,It's called Stu John because George Lucas was being interviewed by John Stewart who asked the question
00:08:50,00:08:56,Where is Obi-Wan Kenobi from and he said no no Stu John and so it's officially canon and I don't like that
00:08:56,00:09:02,Because George Lucas can just say anything in an interview. So it's not in the movies. Exactly. Yeah
00:09:02,00:09:06,Exactly the hence the question. That's a bit like papal infallibility
00:09:06,00:09:11,"But it's a bit of a curse as in if anything you say becomes canon. Yeah, you know, he's gonna be watch his mouth"
00:09:11,00:09:16,"It's like Nixon's argument, you know, if the president does it it isn't illegal if I say it, it's true"
00:09:16,00:09:20,"Well, be careful what you say. Oh God, Nixon was the last person to think that"
00:09:20,00:09:27,Do you remember I don't know if we did it but there was a Jedi because there's a big encyclopedia of
00:09:27,00:09:32,Peripheral characters and they put them all together and someone came up with a new character and called him Bates
00:09:32,00:09:38,And so it got officially put in as master Bates and they missed it the person missed the joke
00:09:38,00:09:45,"And so that's an official Jedi according to the other type of music called jizz. Oh, yeah, that's that space. Yes, space jazz"
00:09:45,00:09:52,Master Bates doing space jazz the Pugwash crossover sounds like it's imminent
00:09:52,00:09:57,"Klingon is a language from not Star Wars Star Trek. Yeah, the other one indeed"
00:09:57,00:10:02,And I found out the other day that they filmed the first Klingon scenes before they'd written the language
00:10:02,00:10:04,"So, you know, it's quite a complex one of those"
00:10:05,00:10:10,"Developed languages. Yeah, so they film the scenes and they just mouth random stuff for the scenes"
00:10:10,00:10:14,And then the guy who was one of these special linguists who they bring on to actually write the language afterwards
00:10:14,00:10:19,I had to make the language match the mouth movements of the initial
00:10:19,00:10:22,Really? Wow first language ever based on
00:10:22,00:10:28,"Mouthing nonsense. That's really clever. That's really good. Anna, you got a fact. Yep"
00:10:28,00:10:35,This is from Hannah Biddle who says that she's sending in a particularly Harkinian fact and I strongly agree and I don't know if I approve of it
00:10:35,00:10:38,But here it is during his career
00:10:38,00:10:42,Raphael Nadal used 300 kilometers of string in
00:10:42,00:10:45,1250 babelette rackets
00:10:45,00:10:50,Now she's added those two together for no reason. That's really explained. So she's got
00:10:50,00:10:55,1550 and then she says as we know Raphael's from Mallorca
00:10:55,00:10:58,Mallorca to the French open in Paris is
00:10:58,00:11:02,1208 kilometers and then Paris to Wimbledon is
00:11:02,00:11:05,1440 making the total trip length basically
00:11:05,00:11:08,1550 kilometers
00:11:08,00:11:14,So that if you add up the she'd be multiplying them together. She shouldn't be doing any of this
00:11:14,00:11:18,And that's what we say to you James after your fence
00:11:18,00:11:24,There's no logic to why she's added the number of babelette rackets to the kilometers of string
00:11:24,00:11:28,She's used and then just use a distance from Mallorca to the French open to Wimbledon
00:11:28,00:11:32,So the amount of string is the total amount of string as well. Yes the full length of string
00:11:32,00:11:36,So that makes a perfect sense Hannah because once you've taken out all the string to measure
00:11:36,00:11:41,Then what are you left with the racket so you just have to count the rackets and then you measure out the string end to end
00:11:41,00:11:44,And then why is Raphael just going from Mallorca to the French open to Wimbledon?
00:11:44,00:11:48,What happens to the Australian open? You need to give her a whole lot more rackets to get to the Australian open
00:11:48,00:11:55,"Yeah, Hannah, I appreciate it. It's very sweet. It's very good. I go on here from Becken Nelson"
00:11:56,00:12:02,Says hope you haven't come across this before the first female dentist in England was called Dr. Payne
00:12:02,00:12:05,Uh middle name Fanny
00:12:05,00:12:11,Nice. So Dr. Lily Fanny Payne does sound like gynecology was the area that she should have gone into but yeah
00:12:11,00:12:15,"Well, I did I did uh google to find out more about her a little heads up for anyone wanting to do the same"
00:12:15,00:12:17,Put quote marks around the name
00:12:17,00:12:21,Because you do come up with some interesting stuff. She's uh 1895
00:12:21,00:12:25,She was studying to become a dentist and it wasn't allowed in England
00:12:25,00:12:29,So she went to Scotland and everyone was saying you can't become a dentist
00:12:29,00:12:32,You're taking the bread out of some good man's mouth. You can't do this
00:12:32,00:12:36,That's where she was looking for the bread in the first place. So like
00:12:36,00:12:42,"So yeah, so she she studied there. She built up a huge debt came back to England was allowed to become uh doctor"
00:12:42,00:12:47,So Dr. Lily Fanny Payne and she spent the first number of years of her
00:12:47,00:12:54,Job paying off the debt that she accrued from going to Scotland. Welcome to being a student and then getting a job Fanny
00:12:55,00:12:57,That's what happens
00:12:57,00:13:01,If you didn't want the debt don't take the course you just reminded me dad
00:13:01,00:13:07,There was a famous British educationalist and feminist and what year was fanny payne 1895 is when I think she
00:13:07,00:13:10,Became this woman was alive too. She was called fanny hurts
00:13:10,00:13:18,"Oh fanny pain and fanny hurts is a good Edinburgh friend show. Yes waiting. Oh buddy cops. Oh, they're cops"
00:13:18,00:13:21,"Oh, they're cops"
00:13:21,00:13:23,What are they?
00:13:23,00:13:25,They always go for the crotch
00:13:25,00:13:27,Fly kick you
00:13:27,00:13:35,"Can I give you guys another? Yeah, this is from Jacob wool who starts off possibly too sad, but it is funny"
00:13:35,00:13:41,"Okay, so a mixed message coming in at the top. I assumed that if you're killing a highly endangered pangolin"
00:13:41,00:13:47,"You know those things they're kind of they're covered in amazing scales. They're yeah, yeah, they're almost like armadillos"
00:13:47,00:13:54,"Yeah, an armadillo anteater cross. Yeah. They're amazing. They're the most trafficked animal in the world. Yes"
00:13:54,00:13:55,And they're very they're
00:13:55,00:13:59,For that reason increasingly rare. So I assume that if you're killing a pangolin
00:13:59,00:14:02,"You're doing it because the scales are used in traditional Chinese medicine, which they are"
00:14:02,00:14:07,But a survey of more than 800 hunters and meat traders in Nigeria
00:14:07,00:14:12,Found that the pangolin is considered to be the most delicious of all the animals
00:14:12,00:14:18,Is it now in addition to being extremely tasty 89 of them were captured by simply picking them up off the ground
00:14:18,00:14:25,"Yeah, that's the problem. They're naive aren't they that's what you call them an animal who'll just let you pick them up naive animal"
00:14:25,00:14:28,That was too sad. That was actually too sad to cover. Sorry. Where's the funny bit?
00:14:28,00:14:33,I'm still waiting for that punch line. Is that they're so tasty. I think that's the funny bit
00:14:33,00:14:39,Do you remember turtles really tasty as well the giant giant tortoises of the Galapagos?
00:14:39,00:14:43,That's the problem with these animals. They need to evolve some bitterness
00:14:43,00:14:48,Do you think what's made us so successful as the human race is just we'd actually taste gross?
00:14:48,00:14:51,"Well, there's a lewis leaky theory isn't there that that's why we have bo"
00:14:51,00:14:52,So that other animals won't eat us
00:14:52,00:14:57,"Yeah, he thinks that we became the dominant species because lions basically came up to us smelt us went no way"
00:14:57,00:15:02,And and he said that you would often find that if there was a dead human
00:15:02,00:15:06,The animal wouldn't start eating it until it had rotted and it had maggots and so on. That's when we were
00:15:07,00:15:12,"Nicest. Yeah, exactly. So we could be ruining our chances of survival by inventing perfume at this point"
00:15:12,00:15:18,"Lions are coming up and going young. Yeah, links Africa. Yeah, don't wear that in the jungle"
00:15:18,00:15:22,Do you remember a few weeks ago? We were talking about why people have beards
00:15:22,00:15:28,"Yeah, and we're like, well, it could only be either to attract women or to sort of get other men"
00:15:28,00:15:35,Or what if it is to make you unpalatable to animals like they get a little hair stuck in their teeth
00:15:35,00:15:38,"Yeah, really annoying to eat and it's right at the top. It's probably your head is the first bit. They're going to eat"
00:15:38,00:15:41,Especially lion tamers
00:15:41,00:15:45,Interesting good theory. That's a good theory
00:15:45,00:15:51,"Um, when the quakers founded the new city in pennsylvania, they decided to call it philadelphia"
00:15:51,00:15:54,"Yeah, uh, after the egyptian city because they thought it meant brotherly love"
00:15:54,00:15:58,"Uh, unfortunately their translation was a bit off and it meant sibling love"
00:15:58,00:16:04,To honor the practice of brother sister marriage in the Ptolemaic thinnesty. I did not know that
00:16:04,00:16:08,I thought it was just brotherly love. That's what I thought as well
00:16:08,00:16:12,So it turns out that the quakers inadvertently named their city incest bill
00:16:12,00:16:15,According to joe brooksmith
00:16:15,00:16:18,That is a good fact
00:16:18,00:16:29,"Um, we now to mention facts that actually aren't correct"
00:16:29,00:16:32,But I think it's a useful thing to know if you sent one in right what you got
00:16:32,00:16:39,"So, um, steven corcoran, I'm afraid you've sent in the fact saying carl marx's great great grandson does parkour"
00:16:39,00:16:43,And has a youtube video called exclamation marks terrific fact
00:16:43,00:16:47,"I thought we might have even said that on this podcast. Wait, no, do you remember what happened with this fact?"
00:16:47,00:16:53,"What happened with it? Okay, so I submitted this as a fact and we were going for it as a headline fact"
00:16:53,00:16:58,And I found the parkour guy and I got in contact with him and we had a chat and he's not
00:16:58,00:17:03,Either he said it jokingly in an interview once or it was just put in an interview and it spreads
00:17:03,00:17:07,"Yeah, so it's not so that's not true. But I just happened upon car marx's daughter's names. He had three daughters"
00:17:07,00:17:09,Do you know what they were called? uh quotation
00:17:09,00:17:12,"um, um, very good stretch"
00:17:12,00:17:15,and
00:17:15,00:17:17,skid
00:17:17,00:17:22,"No, they were all called jenny"
00:17:22,00:17:24,"Oh, okay"
00:17:24,00:17:29,"That's why yeah, I thought they were going to be called like capital and labor and"
00:17:29,00:17:33,"Combine harvester. Yeah, he didn't we wouldn't wish that upon them"
00:17:33,00:17:39,Speaking of marx and names just reminds me of a fact that I submitted to you guys for a headline and we
00:17:39,00:17:44,Turned down which is that there is a brazilian footballer called marx lenin and he's a left winger
00:17:44,00:17:46,Oh
00:17:46,00:17:51,"That's great. There's another car marx fact, which is not true, but it gets peddled around as a truth"
00:17:51,00:17:56,"Which is you know, how he's buried in high gate cemetery. So he has a giant huge"
00:17:56,00:18:01,Gravestone with his head on top and apparently some statue a statue of his head
00:18:01,00:18:07,"There's not a big gravestone and then car marx's decomposing head sitting there. Oh, I see. Yes. Yeah"
00:18:07,00:18:15,it's a huge statue of his head and um supposedly some anarchists wanted to get rid of it and they put a bomb underneath it and
00:18:15,00:18:18,It blew up but it it malfunctioned so only blew up a tiny bit
00:18:18,00:18:23,And if anything the only damage to it is that the graves has slightly shifted to the left
00:18:23,00:18:27,And that's that's been peddled around everywhere and there's no evidence for it
00:18:27,00:18:31,There's some not true car marx facts actually though speaking of car marx. They did find out something quite funny last week
00:18:31,00:18:38,listening to the diana abbot interview so for international listeners diana abbot one of rmp's got herself in trouble
00:18:38,00:18:40,Um in the last couple of weeks
00:18:40,00:18:44,But she got herself in trouble on a podcast where she was being interviewed about her life
00:18:44,00:18:49,And she went out with jeremy corbin and she was talking about the early days of their relationship
00:18:49,00:18:54,"And she said that um, she used to whine and whine and whine saying you never you never take me out"
00:18:54,00:18:59,"We never go anywhere. We never do anything and so he said, okay, I'll treat you fine. Finally"
00:18:59,00:19:02,And she really she probably got all dressed up doled up
00:19:02,00:19:08,"I got really excited, you know cancel the plans for that evening and he took her to high gate cemetery to look at car marx's grave"
00:19:08,00:19:10,Wow
00:19:10,00:19:15,"That was when she thought how you would have liked that, wouldn't you? You would have missed nothing"
00:19:15,00:19:21,"I've had grave dates. Yeah, I've done those. I went to see uh, william mcgonagles grave on a date once"
00:19:21,00:19:23,Did you where is he buried edinburgh?
00:19:23,00:19:27,"See yeah, long way to go for a date. Oh, yeah, it was a cost of time"
00:19:27,00:19:31,Did the other person appreciate it? She actually got off the train at about
00:19:31,00:19:35,I'm the tape rich
00:19:35,00:19:37,Please fall again
00:19:37,00:19:40,Quite an esoteric joke that
00:19:40,00:19:41,Perfect
00:19:41,00:19:43,Internationalists have all turned off at this point
00:19:43,00:19:50,"Interesting. Is it true about car marx's grave that um, is it herbert spencer who he really hated is buried right next to him?"
00:19:50,00:19:55,"Yeah, it's on the opposite side. So they're basically looking at each other. I'm smelling sitcom. Yeah, marx and spencer"
00:19:55,00:20:05,"Uh, I've got another fact here. This is sent in by daniel atkinson who's recently got into watching sumo"
00:20:05,00:20:13,"And so has consumed a ton of sumo information. Uh, so he says sumo wrestlers have to take taxis and ride bikes everywhere"
00:20:13,00:20:19,This is because there are so many sumo related car accidents that the sumo federation has banned them
00:20:19,00:20:21,So they're banned because they're terrible at driving
00:20:21,00:20:25,"Well, what the problem is is that when one sumo wrestler in a car hits another one"
00:20:25,00:20:29,They then just will keep driving until they've driven the other one off the road. Like that's the really sad bit
00:20:29,00:20:33,Those sorry they get bikes
00:20:33,00:20:37,That's gotta look silly those tires have got to withstand quite the pressure
00:20:37,00:20:41,That's a good point. I've never seen a sumo on a bike. Have you? No
00:20:41,00:20:47,"But we don't live in japan. Maybe in japan they're telling plenty. Yeah, um, it's possible"
00:20:47,00:20:52,"I um, I've been to the yearly final of sumo in tokyo"
00:20:52,00:20:58,"Uh, and I reckon that they all turn because they're all I think they're all quite rich aren't they sumo wrestlers these days"
00:20:58,00:21:01,They all had cars that were taken them in because we saw some of them arrive
00:21:02,00:21:05,"Oh, okay. If you didn't see anyone wobbling along, I'm like stabilizers"
00:21:05,00:21:08,We've done so many good facts about sumo over the years
00:21:08,00:21:13,Do you remember the one about the guy who had the top of his head altered because he needed to get the height requirement
00:21:13,00:21:18,"In order to become a sumo. Do you have stuff put in? Yeah, it's like it was like basically like a lump of fat"
00:21:18,00:21:23,"It was like a yeah, like a breast implant basically just put in the top of his skull and then"
00:21:23,00:21:25,Sexy. Yeah
00:21:25,00:21:28,And then there was the um the fact that the
00:21:29,00:21:33,The judges all carry a knife on them in case they make a wrong call out of honor
00:21:33,00:21:38,"They have to kill themselves on the spot. Yeah, I just wasn't having that often anymore"
00:21:38,00:21:43,And what how wrong does the call have to be is it like I give him a four for that? No a three
00:21:43,00:21:47,Here's a good fact from matt fischer
00:21:47,00:21:50,After serving a four-year prison term for forging the hitler diaries
00:21:50,00:21:54,Conrad kujou began selling authentic forgeries under his own name
00:21:55,00:22:00,He often had to authenticate his forgeries because other fordgers were selling forged authentic comrad kujou forgeries
00:22:00,00:22:02,Wow
00:22:02,00:22:04,And I did a bit more digging on this and basically
00:22:04,00:22:10,He came out of prison. He did a little bit of time and then he set up a shop selling forged
00:22:10,00:22:18,"Is it uh horn mirror paintings and maybe some fake darlings as well, but he was acknowledging they were fake"
00:22:18,00:22:21,"Um, it's pretty easy to fake a mirror. Is it?"
00:22:21,00:22:24,It's just circles and triangles aren't they? Miro Miro on the wall
00:22:24,00:22:30,Not relevant
00:22:30,00:22:34,"But basically I found out how he got into forging the hitler diaries. Okay, that's quite a thing to do, isn't it? He"
00:22:34,00:22:41,Collected a lot of Nazi memorabilia. Okay. He was an avid collector of Nazi memorabilia. Hmm. Always a good sign
00:22:41,00:22:49,He bought and the prices in the west were way higher than they were in east germany or west germany because obviously there's
00:22:49,00:22:53,You know demand overseas and it wasn't legal. So he often got his stuff confiscated
00:22:53,00:22:57,"And I guess there was more available in on the german market, you know, than there wasn't in the west"
00:22:57,00:23:01,So he then started forging authentication details for his stuff to make it more valuable
00:23:01,00:23:04,So like he got a first world war helmet which was a real first world war helmet
00:23:04,00:23:07,"And he said oh, this was hitler's helmet and here's a certificate saying it interesting"
00:23:07,00:23:13,And then he started doing stationary and letters and they were really primitive. They were aged with tea
00:23:13,00:23:17,"And you know, they were like children's school projects, but he was getting better and better"
00:23:17,00:23:22,"And then he started doing um, I don't really remember much about that story, but like people fell for it"
00:23:22,00:23:25,"Did they yeah, they were published for it. Somebody times bought them"
00:23:25,00:23:30,Really the hitler diary was embarrassing. It was one of the most embarrassing things
00:23:30,00:23:33,To ever happen to a newspaper
00:23:33,00:23:39,But they were partly full because there were 61 volumes available. Whoa. I know he did a lot of writing
00:23:39,00:23:44,"Why did that make it the more easily fooled? I would have thought it was sunny times, but hitler was a busy man"
00:23:44,00:23:48,How did he have time to write all this? I think if you just give them one page that goes
00:23:48,00:23:54,"Oh, can we invade Poland tomorrow? Yeah, then they might think oh, yeah, this is just been knocked up by someone"
00:23:54,00:23:58,Exactly that. But if it's 60 volumes of him saying bloody Stalin
00:23:58,00:24:03,"But 61, that's a hell of an investment of time if you suddenly hand it over and someone goes this is a fake"
00:24:03,00:24:08,Nine years writing those
00:24:08,00:24:11,I was born with a tiny mustache
00:24:11,00:24:13,[Laughter]
00:24:13,00:24:22,For at least 300 years one common insult against a king was that they had pooed in the font while being baptised
00:24:22,00:24:28,This is according to Cass L and they read it in a book called The Anglo-Saxons by Matt Morris
00:24:28,00:24:31,And they're referring to Ethel Red the Unready
00:24:31,00:24:32,Right
00:24:32,00:24:38,"So yeah, people didn't really rate him very much and they thought we're just gonna make this up about him as far as I know"
00:24:38,00:24:41,He didn't poo in the font. What was the nappy situation back then?
00:24:41,00:24:46,"Great question. Well, Sumo hadn't been invented"
00:24:46,00:24:49,"What were they wearing? Cloth, I guess"
00:24:49,00:24:53,I think a lot of kids would just go without
00:24:53,00:24:57,"It would be cold, wouldn't it? The king, I would think, would have a royal diaper"
00:24:57,00:25:04,"Yeah, swaddling cloths? I think that was a person like you are you just carry get shadow and get pissed on"
00:25:04,00:25:07,I'm the royal diaper
00:25:08,00:25:13,So would they dunk the whole baby in I'm just thinking of the baptisms that my kids have had and it's very much water over the head
00:25:13,00:25:15,"Oh, they often would dunk in"
00:25:15,00:25:16,"Right, so you go full"
00:25:16,00:25:19,Traditionally a proper baptism your head should go under really
00:25:19,00:25:22,"Is that your head? Yeah, like a water body"
00:25:22,00:25:25,This is not precisely how water body works
00:25:25,00:25:27,You're not demanding information from them
00:25:27,00:25:31,Do you know what? I've never been to a baptism and I've never touched wood. I've never been water-boarded
00:25:31,00:25:35,Do you deny the devil?
00:25:36,00:25:38,At all his penions screw you copper
00:25:38,00:25:45,Do you remember I told you guys that thing of when willful was being baptised what happened to me?
00:25:45,00:25:49,"So I was I was handed to him. Oh, you shattered the photo"
00:25:49,00:25:51,Wife I got to pull my nappy
00:25:51,00:25:56,So I was I was holding him and I had to read a piece out
00:25:56,00:25:58,So I was holding will reading a piece out from a bit of paper
00:25:58,00:26:03,And I then had to put the paper down behind me on the table and then hold willful two hands
00:26:03,00:26:05,So I put the paper down behind me and I came back
00:26:05,00:26:09,"And the guy started reading the prayers and I just suddenly was like, oh my god"
00:26:09,00:26:10,Something's on fire
00:26:10,00:26:15,What the hell is on fire and I turned around to see and the paper wasn't touching and there were a few candles there
00:26:15,00:26:20,And I looked down and my arm hair was lit up because I'd gone over a candle as I did it. Yeah
00:26:20,00:26:25,"I was on fire. I mean it was you know slowly going out, but I had to I mean it does feel like the devils had"
00:26:25,00:26:32,"Something to do with that doesn't it? So mr. Shriver, do you believe in god? I do why you want fire?"
00:26:32,00:26:34,Then
00:26:34,00:26:37,Can someone cover that crucifix please?
00:26:37,00:26:47,There's a species of finch
00:26:47,00:26:52,That's named after a guy called finch. What a great fact. Lovely great little fact from
00:26:52,00:26:55,"Well, and you've said it's from someone called Colin sir name"
00:26:57,00:27:04,"Wow, and the surname was named after Colin's mother, yeah, I think Colin signed his email Colin sir name"
00:27:04,00:27:11,"He must have so that's odd from you Colin. Uh, but great fact nonetheless. It is correct. Maybe he's from Surinab and it just"
00:27:11,00:27:19,"So there's a finch called the finch, but no one knows it's named after them because it's just called the finch"
00:27:19,00:27:26,"Is it called the finch finch? Uh, well that it's called finch's euphonia. In fact, um, and it's in the finch family"
00:27:27,00:27:30,I've got one of the name fact. This is from hannah wallis of florida
00:27:30,00:27:34,"Uh, the discography of 98 year old jazz musician dick hyman"
00:27:34,00:27:38,Includes the 1966 album. I'll never be the same
00:27:38,00:27:42,Some of hyman's other albums include the sensuous piano of d
00:27:42,00:27:46,and the man from or g an
00:27:46,00:27:51,The man from organ. We've met him before haven't we? Have we friend of the podcast?
00:27:51,00:27:57,"I'm sure, I'm sure we have a dick hyman. My friends used to have a comedy double act called dick and hyman"
00:27:57,00:28:01,"But that was that was their names really? Yeah, it makes me because a dick hyman like you don't know what that would be"
00:28:01,00:28:04,They didn't normally have them
00:28:04,00:28:13,"No, molly macanerni writes that um an engineer refurbishing and installing old cine-operated pay phones"
00:28:13,00:28:16,That person's name is patrick schlott
00:28:17,00:28:22,"However, the coring slots will not actually be used because the public phone service will be free"
00:28:22,00:28:25,"Oh, okay, but I assume he's worked on other schlottes"
00:28:25,00:28:32,100% schlott. It's such a good surname. It's really good. Schlott. Her name is schlott. You go for casino afterwards. That's what I do
00:28:32,00:28:36,"Yeah, pat schlott is what jane fond would do at a casino"
00:28:36,00:28:39,Pat schlott. Pat the schlott. It's a Sean Connery joke
00:28:39,00:28:45,"Yeah, but what's the pat? Well, you have to you have to you have to you have to test all electronic items"
00:28:45,00:28:47,You have to pat test them
00:28:47,00:28:49,I'm just gonna pat the schlott
00:28:49,00:28:54,Shaky so she's chasing absolutely poor boys not so satisfied with it
00:28:54,00:28:57,I'm not sure about this Bond movie
00:28:57,00:29:01,Why should I said no there again?
00:29:01,00:29:11,Mark Weldon Low says that the granddaughter a famous artist david shepherd is a lamb and that's her married name. She's called lamb
00:29:11,00:29:14,And her grandfather was shepherd
00:29:15,00:29:19,"That's very good. Uh, I go on here from jake from illinois. Yeah"
00:29:19,00:29:25,Who says when the ferris wheel debuted at the columbian world exposition in 1893 in chicago?
00:29:25,00:29:30,They needed to expedite the painting process supposedly francis davis millett. What?
00:29:30,00:29:37,Was it that they just held a paintbrush at the bottom and let the wheel go around so they didn't have to move?
00:29:37,00:29:40,That's how I would do it. That makes total sense. Yeah
00:29:40,00:29:45,"Uh, well supposedly what actually happened was francis davids millett"
00:29:45,00:29:47,Who was the decorations director?
00:29:47,00:29:49,Invented spray paint
00:29:49,00:29:56,Specifically so that the ferris wheel could be done in time. Oh really? Yeah here is quite a nice one
00:29:56,00:30:03,It's from john o'connell jr. And it's a little like the nadal tennis racket stretching fact
00:30:03,00:30:06,In that it's got a distance in it. It's also a stretch
00:30:06,00:30:13,"Well, this is a this one is true though. I have I've followed it up. So john says since french guiana is part of france"
00:30:13,00:30:19,I don't really know much about french guiana. I know it's in south america. I know it's near the top and I know it's um
00:30:19,00:30:24,I saw you really need to know what else do you expect to know what it's exactly the number of dogs living there
00:30:24,00:30:28,"Like, you know, it's main export chief exports. I don't know the chief export"
00:30:28,00:30:32,Cain sugar probably maybe but 41% of it is amazonian
00:30:32,00:30:37,"Rainforest, uh-huh. It's very rain foresty. Anyway, it is but it is part of france"
00:30:37,00:30:41,"In legal terms. Uh-huh. Yeah, it's one of the departement, right?"
00:30:42,00:30:44,"Well, I didn't know that even really"
00:30:44,00:30:48,So since french guiana is part of france john writes and france is part of the european union
00:30:48,00:30:53,"The largest national park in the eu is in south america not in europe, which I like"
00:30:53,00:30:56,It's the biggest national park is
00:30:56,00:31:01,Is there uh following on from this brazil is the country with which france shares its longest land border
00:31:01,00:31:07,"Yeah, I did not I thought what about germany and spain. They're massive and they're both shorter than the brazil french guiana border"
00:31:07,00:31:12,"Yeah, that's a really great fact. It's kind of a little bit. It comes up in quizzes a fair bit that one"
00:31:12,00:31:19,"I once went to a reunion, which is an island in the is in the pacific or the south atlantic or somewhere"
00:31:19,00:31:23,"No, it's in the indian ocean"
00:31:23,00:31:29,Isn't it it's just in the east of africa it's just in the east of africa
00:31:29,00:31:31,But that's also a french departement
00:31:31,00:31:37,So you don't need to go through any security to go between them or any passport control
00:31:37,00:31:42,And I think it's the world's longest domestic flight that goes from charles to go
00:31:42,00:31:47,It was something like 14 hours and does that come up in quizzes
00:31:47,00:31:51,That one i'm not so sure. I'd never heard it before in a quiz
00:31:51,00:31:56,Do you ever worry that going to lots of quizzes as you do blunts your sense of wonder at the most amazing facts in the world?
00:31:56,00:31:58,I'm not sure. I ever had a sense of wonder
00:31:58,00:32:04,"Um, although this really shook me to the core a message from jake"
00:32:04,00:32:10,"Uh, who had been to the kelvin grove museum in glasgo and learned that people would chisel off"
00:32:10,00:32:13,Penises of the gods to use as aphrodisiacs
00:32:13,00:32:16,Hmm in ancient egypt
00:32:16,00:32:22,"Ah, okay. Okay. They eat them or snort them or it's it's not clear"
00:32:22,00:32:26,"To be honest, but I think you would use sprinkler on your ice cream round and sprinkled. Yeah"
00:32:26,00:32:32,At first I thought he was saying that they use them as dildos and I thought that would be interesting
00:32:32,00:32:34,"I do certainly did. Yeah, very interesting"
00:32:34,00:32:42,That explains why you got kicked out of looking at the elke marbles
00:32:42,00:32:46,Penises of the gods is a very evocative phrase
00:32:46,00:32:52,"Yeah, there's something about it feels well. It's like eric von danakins. Um, what's this book chariots of the gods chariots of the gods"
00:32:52,00:32:55,"Yeah, it's a sequel"
00:32:55,00:33:00,"And they were quite small then so actually maybe it wouldn't I think I think because there wasn't this big, um"
00:33:00,00:33:04,"Owners on penis size. Were they big statues? Oh, would you mean there were tiny statues?"
00:33:04,00:33:06,penis size
00:33:06,00:33:09,I actually think like there are some egyptian gods that had quite large penises
00:33:09,00:33:14,"Oh, the egyptian gods had really big penises. I'm sorry. Did you say barbie?"
00:33:14,00:33:16,B-a-b-i
00:33:16,00:33:21,It was like a the monkey god who would take you across to the underworld
00:33:21,00:33:24,And he had a a penis that could be used as a sail
00:33:25,00:33:31,"So kens or an or to hold up the sail so or mast. I've asked. Yeah, because a ken doesn't get a penis, but barbie does"
00:33:31,00:33:36,That's there we go. Very good. Did we talk about the destruction of the herms?
00:33:36,00:33:40,"Because the herms were all they were greek statues, I think and they were"
00:33:40,00:33:45,"A bust of a head and shoulders, but then they did have a little willy sticking out in front"
00:33:45,00:33:48,And they were fertility things and I'm sure there was a period in greece which was the
00:33:48,00:33:54,The demolition of the herms when athens was invaded by someone or other all the herms got chiseled off. Yeah
00:33:55,00:33:59,"Well, I think that was quite common that you would if you went to a place and you wanted to"
00:33:59,00:34:00,disfigure their gods
00:34:00,00:34:03,"You would kind of disfigure the faces, but you would also cut off the genitals"
00:34:03,00:34:06,But that's just what you do today as well. Listen. I mean that's a lot
00:34:06,00:34:10,"It's like the obvious thing to do you see a statue with genitals, which bit you're gonna take"
00:34:10,00:34:15,You'll take the willy. No fair enough. Yeah. What were the herms? I've never heard of these things
00:34:15,00:34:18,What were they attached to if it was just a head and shoulders and then was it sticking out with the neck?
00:34:18,00:34:20,"It was like a column of marble, you know, it was like a column of marble"
00:34:21,00:34:23,Shoulders penis flaw penis flaw
00:34:23,00:34:29,"Uh, yeah, it's a column and then they had like a tiny little willy like as if you were"
00:34:29,00:34:33,Using it to get water out of like a water cooler kind of thing. I see
00:34:33,00:34:37,"Yeah, like a stick man. They just couldn't be asked to draw the rest of the body. Look, it looks like that"
00:34:37,00:34:39,"Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah"
00:34:39,00:34:43,So it is the only it's really the only prominent bit that you can remove
00:34:43,00:34:46,"So it's an obvious target for vandals and hooligans like you, Anna. Yeah"
00:34:46,00:34:49,I've done I've got 20 of them
00:34:49,00:34:54,"Um, I have a very long email"
00:34:54,00:34:57,"Uh, not all of which I'm going to read which actually it doesn't seem to have come"
00:34:57,00:35:00,Signed off by anyone
00:35:00,00:35:04,Which is a shame because they've discovered something amazing. I might not have copied. Does it say Andy Murray at the top there?
00:35:04,00:35:09,"Yeah, it's from some no, that's from someone else called Andy Murray. Well, that's very confusing"
00:35:09,00:35:11,Did they happen to have the same email address as you?
00:35:11,00:35:16,"Let's move on. What are they saying? They're long, but I doubt not fascinating email"
00:35:17,00:35:25,"This person's brandy called Andy Murray has worked out how to get rid of hiccups. So, um, he said skipping out the first nine paragraphs"
00:35:25,00:35:29,"No, it's very good. He said that when he was 13 in school biology"
00:35:29,00:35:34,He learned what causes hiccups and he thought he hypothesized a way to stop it
00:35:34,00:35:39,Should be doing a burp as you feel the first hiccup coming
00:35:39,00:35:42,And he can report that after 45 years of doing that
00:35:42,00:35:45,He's only ever hiccups once
00:35:45,00:35:49,But I never feel my first hiccup coming. You've got to be on the lookout all the time
00:35:49,00:35:55,"It was vigilance. It does. Yeah, it does. But then he did say he lost his concentration"
00:35:55,00:35:59,once on the 28th of november 1990
00:35:59,00:36:03,This was also in the Hitler time. This is kind of detail
00:36:03,00:36:11,I think it was a memorable day for anyone who was an adult at the time because it was the joyful day as he describes it
00:36:11,00:36:16,That thatch resigned and he said he was part of a small group of archaeologists digging this Salisbury
00:36:16,00:36:20,And when they found out they started celebrating got incredibly drunk
00:36:20,00:36:24,He was so happy so drunk on cider that he forgot to burp in time
00:36:24,00:36:30,And he proceeded to hiccup non-stop for 24 hours having obviously saved up all these hiccups
00:36:30,00:36:33,"A lifetime. Yeah, lifetime swimming. Yeah"
00:36:33,00:36:36,"That whole thing sounds like a cautionary tale, doesn't it?"
00:36:37,00:36:43,Of the man who suppressed his hiccups and then hiccups forever. You're so right
00:36:43,00:36:49,That's a that's a Grimm's fairy tale or an esoph's fable or something. I would definitely be up for 61 more volumes of this guy's diary
00:36:49,00:36:52,This is awesome stuff
00:36:52,00:36:55,Here's something from Kate Evans
00:36:55,00:37:02,She tells us that when Leeds became a city for the first time so Leeds and Yorkshire
00:37:02,00:37:04,They didn't have any celebrations
00:37:05,00:37:10,And that is because they only applied because they heard that Sheffield was planning to apply as well
00:37:10,00:37:16,"And thought well since we're the largest city in Yorkshire, we should be a city before Sheffield are so they quickly applied"
00:37:16,00:37:20,They won and then they didn't have any time to prepare the celebrations
00:37:20,00:37:27,"Or maybe they're from Yorkshire, so they're so tight they decided they didn't want to have any parties"
00:37:29,00:37:35,"Um, that's good. I like a I like a city rivalry. Yeah, I'm a big fan of that. What's your favourite?"
00:37:35,00:37:39,"Um, I don't have any really local to me because I'm from London"
00:37:39,00:37:44,Where's the rivalry? London and the entire rest of the UK. You're Oxbridge though
00:37:44,00:37:50,So you were part of like a major the Cambridge Oxbridge library people don't really care about that not properly
00:37:50,00:37:55,"No, unless you're it may shock you to know that Andy's not a rower if you're listening and so I don't think"
00:37:56,00:38:00,Why would that why would listeners not think I was a rower? They think you're a cox
00:38:00,00:38:09,Sox on them I rode on the coxless force and that was a very painful team to get into I must say good lord
00:38:09,00:38:16,Andy is so much of a cox that he got destroyed by the Phoenician empire. Wow
00:38:16,00:38:18,Okay
00:38:18,00:38:21,"Um, no do rowers care about that really? I mean they do for the boat race"
00:38:22,00:38:26,Let's move on let's move on. I'd love our UK version of roast shows
00:38:26,00:38:33,I don't think Jimmy Carr will be signing on to hope this one
00:38:33,00:38:36,Oh dear
00:38:36,00:38:46,"Um, I've got a fact about Wieners. This is from Ralph Lynn Sangon"
00:38:47,00:38:52,And it says in brackets repeat. I don't know if that means repeat the name Ralph Lynn Sangon Lynn Sangon
00:38:52,00:38:54,Or if it means the email is repeated
00:38:54,00:39:00,"But anyway, he headlines it by saying cybernetic Wieners are only possible because of dr. Wiener"
00:39:00,00:39:05,Quite confusing because I'm always a bit confused about the word cybernetic and what it actually doesn't mean anything does it?
00:39:05,00:39:11,"No, well, so I looked up and it doesn't doesn't really I'm out cybernetics is a study of automatic control and information exchange"
00:39:11,00:39:14,Sort of between machines and living things
00:39:14,00:39:19,So that so I think it's related to prosthetics. So if you've got a prosthetic penis that can be remote controlled or something
00:39:19,00:39:23,"I'll do something it's in remote control. Wow. Yeah, that would be cool, wouldn't it?"
00:39:23,00:39:27,"Sorry, I just need to pull the batteries out and rub them a few times"
00:39:27,00:39:34,"This guy's called Norbert Wiener Dr. Norbert Wiener. Oh, I've heard of him. Yeah, I think he's quite a big deal"
00:39:34,00:39:39,"so he was the he was the founder of cybernetics, which is a big deal and um"
00:39:39,00:39:41,That was the runner-up name that lost out to James Bond
00:39:42,00:39:45,But it was going to be the names of wiener norbert wiener
00:39:45,00:39:51,It's a fun fun trivia fact and it would be sexy if that would happen that would be a sexy name right now
00:39:51,00:39:53,Norbert wiener and patch lot
00:39:53,00:40:02,"He sounds he sounds very cool norbert wiener and worth more than uh, we're making it sound like he learned 34 languages apparently"
00:40:02,00:40:06,"Um, uh, graduated college 14 got phd at 17"
00:40:06,00:40:10,He was known as the most remarkable boy in the world in 1906
00:40:10,00:40:14,But maybe the reason you've heard of him James is that he came up with the wiener sausage
00:40:14,00:40:16,So he was a mathematician
00:40:16,00:40:23,Oh and in the and i'm just going to read this out and good luck ever grasping it get a phd in the mathematical field of probability
00:40:23,00:40:31,The wiener sausage is something that can be visualized as a sausage of fixed radius whose centerline is brownie in motion
00:40:31,00:40:33,"Uh, we have talked a bit about brownie emotion on the show"
00:40:33,00:40:38,"But anyway, he he came up with this mathematical concept that was named after him"
00:40:38,00:40:43,"So it looks like a sausage in maths. Yeah, and it's named after him. So it's called the wiener sausage. Got it"
00:40:43,00:40:45,You know math. I'm just a fun too. Yeah
00:40:45,00:40:49,And he was responsible for the cybernetic
00:40:49,00:40:56,"and he he founded cybernetics and so uh, um machine human interfaces and stuff like that of which"
00:40:56,00:41:00,Prosthetic penises could be seen as an extension. I think is what the person is saying
00:41:00,00:41:03,"Okay, so he wasn't a penis technician himself"
00:41:03,00:41:06,No more than any of us are
00:41:06,00:41:11,"Yeah, uh, I got I got something here from jessica cluckus. I think that's how you pronounce it"
00:41:11,00:41:16,"Uh, she's from the island man and she says I am surprises not come up more on the pod"
00:41:16,00:41:23,"So here are some facts that I love pilates were invented in patrick, which is a local town in the island man"
00:41:23,00:41:25,Is that true? I didn't know that
00:41:25,00:41:27,Halloween does not exist there
00:41:27,00:41:29,"Well, I guess you don't have to do everything quite right too"
00:41:29,00:41:33,But it also doesn't exist in the Murray household
00:41:33,00:41:37,"Yeah, because I'm I've turned off the lights and I'm lying on the floor"
00:41:37,00:41:42,Which actually would be a great position to spook people from but I don't I don't do that in case local kids come around and
00:41:42,00:41:43,You know alarm me
00:41:43,00:41:48,She says we were the first to give women the vote and have the oldest continuing running parliament in the world
00:41:48,00:41:50,How ironic of the isle of man
00:41:50,00:41:57,What about jeff the talking mongoose he is from the island man. Yes
00:41:57,00:42:02,The ghostly mongoose is that why they don't have halloween because he scared everyone
00:42:02,00:42:05,It's too real. It's too many bad memories. Yeah
00:42:05,00:42:11,That was like a young teenage girl or something who pretended that she was talking to a ghostly mongoose
00:42:11,00:42:17,And then got all of the newspapers involved and everyone believed it and probably cone and dial did or someone like that
00:42:17,00:42:21,"Oh, yeah, yeah, I think all the biggest like ghost hunters of the time went to investigate it as well"
00:42:21,00:42:23,"So it was yeah, it's quite there's a great biog on it"
00:42:23,00:42:27,It was quite a big scandal we covered it ages ago and the bbc got involved in a way that meant they had to change
00:42:27,00:42:30,All their regulations when it turned out it was fake or something
00:42:30,00:42:33,That's right bbc scandals used to be certainly more wholesome
00:42:33,00:42:39,"Yeah, they were more fun. Actually jeff the talking mongoose also used to get his penis out at parties. Oh"
00:42:39,00:42:42,jeff jeff
00:42:42,00:42:47,"Um, do you said pilates was invented on the isle of man? I'm really surprised about that"
00:42:47,00:42:53,What am I remembering this right or wrong that it was invented by someone called like tony pilates
00:42:53,00:42:56,It was it was invented by mr. Pilates who I don't think was from the isle of man
00:42:56,00:43:03,"Like bitcrame yoga was invented by he wasn't tony, but mr. Bitcrame. Yeah. Yeah. I just think that's I love those things"
00:43:03,00:43:06,Unexpected things named after people german
00:43:06,00:43:10,"Um, chocolate cake is named after a guy called german"
00:43:10,00:43:13,Brilliant brilliant that kind of stuff. Yeah
00:43:13,00:43:18,So according to just a super quick google while you guys were chatting pilates was developed by joseph pilates
00:43:18,00:43:19,He was from germany
00:43:19,00:43:25,His father was a gymnast and his mother a naturopath pilates said the inspiration for his method came to him during world war one
00:43:26,00:43:28,While he was being held at a camp in the isle of man
00:43:28,00:43:33,Can I just say that I don't think it's really fair for the isle of man to claim that as one of their
00:43:33,00:43:37,When the person who invented it was being held prisoner there. I think
00:43:37,00:43:39,That's fair
00:43:39,00:43:41,We're torturing it out of him in the end
00:43:41,00:43:46,Maybe he was coming up with those positions to try and escape. We don't know
00:43:46,00:43:50,That was the only way he could get under the fence was by blanking for seven minutes
00:43:50,00:43:54,"Um, here's a great one. This is from nat edwards"
00:43:55,00:44:01,Who is master of the armories at the royal armories in leeds. Very cool. What a cool thing
00:44:01,00:44:04,So here we go. This is the fact in the late 19th and early 20th centuries
00:44:04,00:44:11,"Special guns were popular among cyclists, especially in france belgium and spain for shooting bothersome dogs"
00:44:11,00:44:13,"Oh, yeah"
00:44:13,00:44:16,Cyclists would have guns marketed to them and this was invented
00:44:16,00:44:18,"Uh, the velo dog"
00:44:18,00:44:22,A new kind of ammunition that could be fired from small lightweight powerful revolvers
00:44:23,00:44:26,"Allowing that they were not very accurate. Uh, and they were called dog revolvers"
00:44:26,00:44:32,One of them was even used in an attempt to assassinate king alfonso the 13th who survived possibly on account of not being a dog
00:44:32,00:44:39,"Um, because we've um been researching this for qi weirdly this year or last year and water pistols were invented"
00:44:39,00:44:44,For scaring dogs as well the first adverts you see for water pistols in the newspapers were
00:44:44,00:44:47,Use this to get rid of dogs and it was for cyclists
00:44:47,00:44:50,So that make water pistol makes sense to me like you've got a troublesome dog
00:44:50,00:44:55,You're on your bike. You don't want to you know an actual gun for a dog feels a bit
00:44:55,00:44:59,Do you shoot it or do you try and scare it or do you pistol whip it?
00:44:59,00:45:03,"And when I say whip it, I mean that's the type of dog you're"
00:45:03,00:45:06,I think the idea was to shoot them
00:45:06,00:45:09,I think it's dogs like water so the water pistols probably not that successful
00:45:09,00:45:12,They probably just went for more and more if I splurged the water pistol at my mum's dog
00:45:12,00:45:14,It would just want to eat the water
00:45:14,00:45:15,So
00:45:15,00:45:17,Mum's dog is very stupid though
00:45:17,00:45:19,You need to grade up
00:45:19,00:45:25,To machine gun. Yeah. There's a good fact here from luka from isli. I'm going to do it as a riddle
00:45:25,00:45:31,There's a golf course where you can hit the ball and it stays in the air for an hour and three seconds
00:45:31,00:45:34,nuclear quantum
00:45:34,00:45:37,um
00:45:37,00:45:39,Intangley
00:45:39,00:45:43,"No, no, no go on the intangrel thing"
00:45:43,00:45:48,It's very simple it lands in the higgs bosons. Have you hit it around?
00:45:49,00:45:51,Yeah
00:45:51,00:45:55,"It's time zones. Yeah, do you know this one? Oh, that's cool. I haven't heard of it. No, it's a green zone"
00:45:55,00:46:01,Golf course and it straddles finland and sweden and there are seven holes in finland and 11 in sweden
00:46:01,00:46:05,So on hole six you hit the ball and it stays in the air for an hour
00:46:05,00:46:10,"That's great. You know what I have heard of that golf course, but I haven't thought of the time zone part of it"
00:46:10,00:46:14,That's so good. That's good for a crime. So I'm just going to say it for an alibi
00:46:15,00:46:20,Where were you? I was here for an hour wait for the ball to come down. So I couldn't have killed him
00:46:20,00:46:22,Obvious
00:46:22,00:46:24,I think it was the quantum physicist
00:46:24,00:46:30,Funny pain and funny. That was a kick of a crap out of a quantum physicist over here
00:46:30,00:46:39,"Um, I wasn't going to mention this one, but I will because it's related to james bond. We've been mentioning uh that bit"
00:46:39,00:46:41,Andy coming has sent this in uh two facts
00:46:42,00:46:46,William stevensson the man james bond was fashioned after who was from winnipeg
00:46:46,00:46:51,So I think andy coming's from canada once escaped prison using a can opener
00:46:51,00:46:54,"Yes, and says this only bends the truth a touch"
00:46:54,00:46:57,Now I didn't look into that because I wasn't going to read that
00:46:57,00:47:00,I thought james bond was modelled after quite a few other people as well
00:47:00,00:47:04,"Um, I think there's a few different people isn't there like for instance james bond the"
00:47:04,00:47:07,Ornithologist yes in fleming had a cool older brother
00:47:07,00:47:11,"Oh, I think did lots of expeditions and travel and big game hunting and stuff like that. Yeah, that's right"
00:47:11,00:47:12,I might have been part of it
00:47:12,00:47:15,But do we know what happened with the tin up there because I wasn't going to read it
00:47:15,00:47:19,"I was going to bring in his next fact, which I thought was quite a far one"
00:47:19,00:47:22,So he sent two two fun facts the city of regina
00:47:22,00:47:25,Briefly had the slogan the city that rhymes with fun
00:47:25,00:47:29,As you might imagine people were fired
00:47:29,00:47:34,That's really good
00:47:34,00:47:40,"I actually I have another one from uh, steven corcoran of exclamation marks fact fame. Oh, yeah, okay"
00:47:40,00:47:43,"Non fact fame. Yes. Well, this is this is a good one"
00:47:43,00:47:47,It's that a british officer captured during the first world war was granted leave
00:47:47,00:47:51,To visit his dying mother on one condition that he returned
00:47:51,00:47:58,This is about a captain called robert cambell. He was captured really early in the first world war august 1914
00:47:58,00:48:00,I mean just such bad luck
00:48:00,00:48:03,You know you got to set out the whole thing and he got word when he was in a prisoner of war camp
00:48:03,00:48:07,That his mum was dying and he wrote to the kaiser saying look can I please go and visit my mother?
00:48:07,00:48:11,"I will come back and the kaiser said yes, but you got to come back"
00:48:11,00:48:15,"And he went he went home. He went to kent, which must have been such a weird experience"
00:48:15,00:48:18,Spend a week with his mum
00:48:18,00:48:22,Kind of saying goodbye and then he went back to prison voluntarily
00:48:22,00:48:26,Then as soon as he got back he started digging a tunnel for the next nine months
00:48:26,00:48:32,"Then escaped via and then was recaptured again. Anyway, good on him. He wanted to escape the uh the honorable way, yeah"
00:48:32,00:48:37,"Oh, yeah, completely. Yeah, yeah, and I'm sorry. It's good back though because you just seem they just chase you down"
00:48:37,00:48:40,"They know where your mum lives. They know where you live. Yeah, but you're left with Germans"
00:48:40,00:48:42,They're at war with the place where you are
00:48:42,00:48:49,"Yeah, I've overestimated how easy it was to just send one of them then over to kent for a point"
00:48:49,00:48:50,Per point
00:48:50,00:48:54,I think he thought that if he didn't go back other prisoner exchanges might not happen
00:48:54,00:48:58,"That they just end the whole system and anyway, he lived until 1966"
00:48:58,00:49:01,"Did he yeah? Yeah, what month?"
00:49:02,00:49:05,Just wondering if he saw the world cup. What month was the world cup? It was in the summer
00:49:05,00:49:11,The report I found said he died in the isle of wight in july 1966 age 81
00:49:11,00:49:17,That would have been tight. It would have been tight. He might have seen the qualifying the earlier rounds in the tournament
00:49:17,00:49:20,They think it's all of oh it is
00:49:20,00:49:26,"Who did england be in that match? West Germany. Oh, so it would have been. What a beautiful"
00:49:27,00:49:34,"I've got to find out if he saw the world cup. I mean, he saw the victory in the first world war and the second which was arguably"
00:49:34,00:49:38,"You know, he'll have cared more about we don't even know if he liked football. We know he liked war"
00:49:38,00:49:43,Did he like war? Was that why they altered it?
00:49:43,00:49:47,Um from ana ridpath
00:49:47,00:49:52,That's just a nice bit of trivia. She says my friend Nathan is a big fan of baseball. So this is credited to Nathan
00:49:53,00:49:58,There was a single baseball player called danny Janssen who played for two teams in a single game. How?
00:49:58,00:50:01,"Oh, this is uh, very simple quantum"
00:50:01,00:50:10,Do you want to carry on or shall I answer please the game was postponed halfway through any move between teams?
00:50:10,00:50:15,I'm really sorry that jamesy's on killing all of your scientific theorising. I'll get at one of these days
00:50:15,00:50:17,One of these days is going to be quantum
00:50:17,00:50:20,"Still another alibi to you, Andy"
00:50:20,00:50:22,I wasn't even on that team. I couldn't have killed him
00:50:22,00:50:30,"Yeah, you're absolutely correct. Uh, the it was postponed because uh in clement weather"
00:50:30,00:50:34,And he was traded from the toronto blue jay to the boston red socks
00:50:34,00:50:35,Wow
00:50:35,00:50:37,"And then uh, he was put in a particle accelerator"
00:50:37,00:50:49,"Right, that's it. That's all of your facts. Thank you so much for sending them in"
00:50:49,00:50:57,"Uh, if you'd like to send in more facts, then please do the email is podcast@qi.com and we'll do another one of these before too long"
00:50:57,00:51:02,They all get read. They all get read even the very long ones. So that's
