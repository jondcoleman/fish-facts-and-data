 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing. As a fish we have a very exciting announcement for you if you live in London or

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:14.480
 If you live anywhere else in the world that should cover most of you, I think. Yeah, that's it. If you're on the ISS

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.600
 I'm sorry. This is not for you

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.920
 Click forward

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.480
 We are doing a couple of live shows at the fantastic London podcast festival

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.000
 We're doing them next week if you're listening to this as it goes out. It's the 5th and 6th of September

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.920
 It's going to be so much fun. We have two unbelievably special guests. Do you want to say who they are James?

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.680
 Yeah, they are Titans of podcasting. I would say yeah, Diane's of podcasting

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:46.600
 Grand-dam the podcasting absolutely. They are Richard Osman of the rest is entertainment podcast and

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:53.200
 It's only blimming Jamie Martin from my dad wrote a porno the greatest of all the podcasts

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.640
 That's right. Richard and Jamie are going to be joining us live on stage

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.520
 and it's going to be so much fun and it's going to be especially fun if you're either in the room or

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.600
 Watching the live stream of it because and this is one for everyone around the world

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.080
 We're doing a live stream and you get to see all the bits that we edit out of the final show because they're just too

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.760
 Darn funny or too rude or too exciting

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.720
 Absolutely, and if you are on the ISS, but you're coming down the seven days

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.400
 Subsequent to the shows that we're doing then don't worry because the streams will be available to watch for seven days after the live event

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.240
 Absolutely, absolutely. So really this is an entire human species experience

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.720
 And if you're an animal listening to this if you're a chicken or a monkey or an alligator

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.880
 Just ask the nearest human to set you up with a live streaming ticket and they will be able to do that

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.880
 Absolutely, so for details about those shows which are on Friday the fifth of September and Saturday the 6th of September

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:52.000

 You can get tickets to the festival if there's any left and all those lovely lovely live stream tickets brilliant

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:04.880
 I think I think I think that's it. Isn't it? That's all I have on my list. It's me too. Let's do the show up with the podcast

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.040
 Hi everybody, welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.960
 This is one of our audience facts specials when we're going to talk about your facts

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.240
 My name is Andrew Hunter Murray

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.000
 I'm here in the qi offices in Hoban with Dan tribe at Anna Tashinsky and James Harkin

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.040
 We have gathered around the table with

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.400
 three months worth of

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.880
 crisp fresh hot

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.560
 good audience facts and we're going to be sharing them with you and

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:53.880
 We've had some cracking stuff in the inbox as we always do we have a new circulated round to the three of us the choicest cuts

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:00.160
 Absolutely, but I haven't verified the stuff. I've sent you or done any extra research

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.880
 This is mostly audience emails without that filtration system

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.760
 Well, you never know we might have verified or done extra research depends how diligent we are

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:16.080
 Also listener listen out to what we're all saying and work out for yourselves if Andy has kept the choicest cuts to himself

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.760
 Yeah, why don't you give us a fact to start off with Andy? Okay. Here's here's a fun one

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:28.600
 This is from Pete Nissen who says a computer engineer for the astronomy department at a prestigious US university

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.120
 Sorry, that's who he is

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:38.480
 Works we've got the answer if he's kept the choices cuts

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:45.440
 Pete Pete works at a prestigious US University and as a computer engineer for the astronomy department

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.280
 He says every single faculty member firmly believes that alien life probably exists

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.440
 But the distances are too big and the laws of physics too rated for aliens to ever visit earth

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:01.620
 Yeah, that's what I think as well. Okay, however, I've recently come into possession of hard evidence that contradicts this

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:12.520
 I'm so annoyed that I put my cards on the tables anyway, so here's Pete's evidence the first

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:19.040
 Human in quotes to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong. I agree with that. Okay

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.640
 James. Oh, you've done it again

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.280
 Neil Armstrong spelled backwards is

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.400
 Oh, yeah, it's mr. Alien

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.680
 That's right apart from that word gnawts, which doesn't mean anything in our languages

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:40.440
 Mr. Alien is is irrefutable proof as Pete calls it and he's going to be presenting that at the next faculty meeting

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.060
 I've got to say I'm quite glad that I put my cards on the table nice and early now

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:52.520
 Sounds like damn was well-versed in this age old alien backwards. We heard that one. I knew Neil a is alien backwards

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.000
 Yeah, I didn't have people talked about that before is this all over there. Yeah. Yeah, that's a big thing

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.260
 I but it's not used in terms of a conspiracy theory. It's just used as like oh, what a nice coincidence like

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.240
 Buzz Aldrin's mother's maiden name was moon. Yeah

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.200
 One Michael Collins, yes, probably can do something with that dude at home

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:18.160
 snilock I read a while ago that the reason we haven't had aliens here yet is because any

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:26.620
 Civilization that can travel throughout a space will necessarily have also created technology that can wipe itself out

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.920
 Yeah, interesting and then there's another theory which is that we always talk about the distance of space

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:37.320
 But we sometimes forget how much time there has been since the beginning of the universe

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.560
 So you might have had a civilization

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.640
 They got to where we've got to ready to go out space-faring and then as James says they wipe themselves out

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.200
 We've just lived two billion years distant from them when they were active and they were ready and they were sending

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.440
 So it's like a rom-com sort of meet cute missing out on each other

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.360
 Yeah, exactly Michael Collins does contain all the letters of the word alien just so you know

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.160
 I wondered why you weren't paying attention when I said all that stuff

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:07.600
 Also cock mills alien cock mills. So okay, that's interesting. Are they making bread out of them?

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.680
 My research hasn't revealed that yet. Wow. I'll do some more anagrams and work it out. Let's have another fact

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:24.520
 Okay, this one is from Jorge Murillo or George Murillo and they say that 10 million people in South America can understand Jabba the Hutt

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:32.080
 That's so interesting. I assume that was a made-up language. So has it been a language that's been adopted

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:38.920
 It's a made-up language called hutties and it's in Star Wars of course for anyone doesn't know Star Wars

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:44.460
 But it was invented by it was based on a language called quetua

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:50.440
 Which is spoken in South America and there is enough words in quetua that if you're

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:56.040
 Well-versed in that language you can listen to Star Wars and you pick little bits up. That's so good

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:00.840
 So it's like a dialect. I guess so or it's a bit like a Portuguese person in Spain

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:07.080
 Can sort of piece a lot of it together maybe yes a bit like that a bit like how if we hear sort of a Dutch person talking

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.680
 We can kind of pick up bits of it, but it's a different language. I have no idea

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:21.720
 Some of the words from quetua in English alpaca condor guano Lima has in the beans

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:26.440
 It's all quite that part of the world related stuff, isn't it? They haven't given us the word for chow main

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:40.080
 There's quite a few quetua languages as in there it's like a language group and one of them is called the wanker language

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:49.800
 Feels like your bonus research it does yeah, that's from my own files because I actually I was there in South America a while ago

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.960
 And I bought a football jersey from the team the party for wanker

00:07:53.960 --> 00:08:00.580
 These people I thought you're gonna say and I kept hearing people call

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:05.120
 Your guy told you nurse so local language

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.360
 Did always say something about his grandparents?

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.600
 He said that they were having lunch one day

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:16.680
 He and his sister and his family and they got to a bit where and the reason I didn't read this out is because these are people

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.620
 I'd never heard of grido holds hands solo at gunpoint and

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:26.600
 Almost immediately they kind of looked at each other because they recognized what they were saying as crazy. Isn't that crazy?

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:31.120
 That's amazing, you know I'm Star Wars. I read about the other day

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:36.580
 So the planet where Obi-Wan Kenobi comes from do you know what it's called? I thought it was called Tatooine

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:39.280
 No, so that's where he was based. That's where he lived

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:45.080
 It's a crossover we didn't know existed. It's called Stu John

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:50.560
 It's called Stu John because George Lucas was being interviewed by John Stewart who asked the question

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:56.820
 Where is Obi-Wan Kenobi from and he said no no Stu John and so it's officially canon and I don't like that

00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:02.040
 Because George Lucas can just say anything in an interview. So it's not in the movies. Exactly. Yeah

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:06.280
 Exactly the hence the question. That's a bit like papal infallibility

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:11.720
 But it's a bit of a curse as in if anything you say becomes canon. Yeah, you know, he's gonna be watch his mouth

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:16.680
 It's like Nixon's argument, you know, if the president does it it isn't illegal if I say it, it's true

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:20.880
 Well, be careful what you say. Oh God, Nixon was the last person to think that

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:27.880
 Do you remember I don't know if we did it but there was a Jedi because there's a big encyclopedia of

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:32.800
 Peripheral characters and they put them all together and someone came up with a new character and called him Bates

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:38.560
 And so it got officially put in as master Bates and they missed it the person missed the joke

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:45.840
 And so that's an official Jedi according to the other type of music called jizz. Oh, yeah, that's that space. Yes, space jazz

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:52.320
 Master Bates doing space jazz the Pugwash crossover sounds like it's imminent

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:57.280
 Klingon is a language from not Star Wars Star Trek. Yeah, the other one indeed

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:02.760
 And I found out the other day that they filmed the first Klingon scenes before they'd written the language

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.760
 So, you know, it's quite a complex one of those

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:10.200
 Developed languages. Yeah, so they film the scenes and they just mouth random stuff for the scenes

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.640
 And then the guy who was one of these special linguists who they bring on to actually write the language afterwards

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:19.080
 I had to make the language match the mouth movements of the initial

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.260
 Really? Wow first language ever based on

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:28.000
 Mouthing nonsense. That's really clever. That's really good. Anna, you got a fact. Yep

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:35.520
 This is from Hannah Biddle who says that she's sending in a particularly Harkinian fact and I strongly agree and I don't know if I approve of it

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.240
 But here it is during his career

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:42.200
 Raphael Nadal used 300 kilometers of string in

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.120
 1250 babelette rackets

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:50.920
 Now she's added those two together for no reason. That's really explained. So she's got

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:55.600
 1550 and then she says as we know Raphael's from Mallorca

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.000
 Mallorca to the French open in Paris is

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.040
 1208 kilometers and then Paris to Wimbledon is

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:05.240
 1440 making the total trip length basically

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:08.400
 1550 kilometers

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:14.400
 So that if you add up the she'd be multiplying them together. She shouldn't be doing any of this

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.720
 And that's what we say to you James after your fence

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:24.640
 There's no logic to why she's added the number of babelette rackets to the kilometers of string

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:28.520
 She's used and then just use a distance from Mallorca to the French open to Wimbledon

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:32.760
 So the amount of string is the total amount of string as well. Yes the full length of string

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.040
 So that makes a perfect sense Hannah because once you've taken out all the string to measure

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:41.240
 Then what are you left with the racket so you just have to count the rackets and then you measure out the string end to end

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:44.840
 And then why is Raphael just going from Mallorca to the French open to Wimbledon?

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:48.680
 What happens to the Australian open? You need to give her a whole lot more rackets to get to the Australian open

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:55.960
 Yeah, Hannah, I appreciate it. It's very sweet. It's very good. I go on here from Becken Nelson

00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:02.520
 Says hope you haven't come across this before the first female dentist in England was called Dr. Payne

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:05.080
 Uh middle name Fanny

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:11.400
 Nice. So Dr. Lily Fanny Payne does sound like gynecology was the area that she should have gone into but yeah

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:15.800
 Well, I did I did uh google to find out more about her a little heads up for anyone wanting to do the same

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:17.880
 Put quote marks around the name

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:21.400
 Because you do come up with some interesting stuff. She's uh 1895

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:25.640
 She was studying to become a dentist and it wasn't allowed in England

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:29.640
 So she went to Scotland and everyone was saying you can't become a dentist

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.680
 You're taking the bread out of some good man's mouth. You can't do this

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:36.360
 That's where she was looking for the bread in the first place. So like

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:42.680
 So yeah, so she she studied there. She built up a huge debt came back to England was allowed to become uh doctor

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:47.720
 So Dr. Lily Fanny Payne and she spent the first number of years of her

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:54.760
 Job paying off the debt that she accrued from going to Scotland. Welcome to being a student and then getting a job Fanny

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.240
 That's what happens

00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:01.080
 If you didn't want the debt don't take the course you just reminded me dad

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:07.640
 There was a famous British educationalist and feminist and what year was fanny payne 1895 is when I think she

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.760
 Became this woman was alive too. She was called fanny hurts

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:18.280
 Oh fanny pain and fanny hurts is a good Edinburgh friend show. Yes waiting. Oh buddy cops. Oh, they're cops

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:21.000
 Oh, they're cops

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.240
 What are they?

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.240
 They always go for the crotch

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.720
 Fly kick you

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:35.320
 Can I give you guys another? Yeah, this is from Jacob wool who starts off possibly too sad, but it is funny

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:41.560
 Okay, so a mixed message coming in at the top. I assumed that if you're killing a highly endangered pangolin

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:47.480
 You know those things they're kind of they're covered in amazing scales. They're yeah, yeah, they're almost like armadillos

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:54.200
 Yeah, an armadillo anteater cross. Yeah. They're amazing. They're the most trafficked animal in the world. Yes

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.880
 And they're very they're

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:59.080
 For that reason increasingly rare. So I assume that if you're killing a pangolin

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:02.520
 You're doing it because the scales are used in traditional Chinese medicine, which they are

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:07.000
 But a survey of more than 800 hunters and meat traders in Nigeria

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.200
 Found that the pangolin is considered to be the most delicious of all the animals

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:18.600
 Is it now in addition to being extremely tasty 89 of them were captured by simply picking them up off the ground

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:25.080
 Yeah, that's the problem. They're naive aren't they that's what you call them an animal who'll just let you pick them up naive animal

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:28.840
 That was too sad. That was actually too sad to cover. Sorry. Where's the funny bit?

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:33.320
 I'm still waiting for that punch line. Is that they're so tasty. I think that's the funny bit

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:39.640
 Do you remember turtles really tasty as well the giant giant tortoises of the Galapagos?

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:43.400
 That's the problem with these animals. They need to evolve some bitterness

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:48.040
 Do you think what's made us so successful as the human race is just we'd actually taste gross?

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:51.400
 Well, there's a lewis leaky theory isn't there that that's why we have bo

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:52.840
 So that other animals won't eat us

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:57.800
 Yeah, he thinks that we became the dominant species because lions basically came up to us smelt us went no way

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:02.200
 And and he said that you would often find that if there was a dead human

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:06.920
 The animal wouldn't start eating it until it had rotted and it had maggots and so on. That's when we were

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:12.920
 Nicest. Yeah, exactly. So we could be ruining our chances of survival by inventing perfume at this point

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:18.360
 Lions are coming up and going young. Yeah, links Africa. Yeah, don't wear that in the jungle

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:22.520
 Do you remember a few weeks ago? We were talking about why people have beards

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:28.760
 Yeah, and we're like, well, it could only be either to attract women or to sort of get other men

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:35.080
 Or what if it is to make you unpalatable to animals like they get a little hair stuck in their teeth

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:38.680
 Yeah, really annoying to eat and it's right at the top. It's probably your head is the first bit. They're going to eat

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.080
 Especially lion tamers

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:45.960
 Interesting good theory. That's a good theory

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:51.240
 Um, when the quakers founded the new city in pennsylvania, they decided to call it philadelphia

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:54.840
 Yeah, uh, after the egyptian city because they thought it meant brotherly love

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:58.600
 Uh, unfortunately their translation was a bit off and it meant sibling love

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:04.200
 To honor the practice of brother sister marriage in the Ptolemaic thinnesty. I did not know that

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:08.200
 I thought it was just brotherly love. That's what I thought as well

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:12.440
 So it turns out that the quakers inadvertently named their city incest bill

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:15.560
 According to joe brooksmith

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:18.760
 That is a good fact

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:29.080
 Um, we now to mention facts that actually aren't correct

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.200
 But I think it's a useful thing to know if you sent one in right what you got

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:39.320
 So, um, steven corcoran, I'm afraid you've sent in the fact saying carl marx's great great grandson does parkour

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:43.080
 And has a youtube video called exclamation marks terrific fact

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:47.800
 I thought we might have even said that on this podcast. Wait, no, do you remember what happened with this fact?

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:53.320
 What happened with it? Okay, so I submitted this as a fact and we were going for it as a headline fact

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:58.280
 And I found the parkour guy and I got in contact with him and we had a chat and he's not

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:03.080
 Either he said it jokingly in an interview once or it was just put in an interview and it spreads

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:07.960
 Yeah, so it's not so that's not true. But I just happened upon car marx's daughter's names. He had three daughters

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.960
 Do you know what they were called? uh quotation

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:12.760
 um, um, very good stretch

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:15.560
 and

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.560
 skid

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:22.760
 No, they were all called jenny

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:24.680
 Oh, okay

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:29.320
 That's why yeah, I thought they were going to be called like capital and labor and

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:33.480
 Combine harvester. Yeah, he didn't we wouldn't wish that upon them

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:39.480
 Speaking of marx and names just reminds me of a fact that I submitted to you guys for a headline and we

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:44.600
 Turned down which is that there is a brazilian footballer called marx lenin and he's a left winger

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.920
 Oh

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:51.560
 That's great. There's another car marx fact, which is not true, but it gets peddled around as a truth

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:56.280
 Which is you know, how he's buried in high gate cemetery. So he has a giant huge

00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:01.560
 Gravestone with his head on top and apparently some statue a statue of his head

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:07.560
 There's not a big gravestone and then car marx's decomposing head sitting there. Oh, I see. Yes. Yeah

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:15.240
 it's a huge statue of his head and um supposedly some anarchists wanted to get rid of it and they put a bomb underneath it and

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.520
 It blew up but it it malfunctioned so only blew up a tiny bit

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:23.160
 And if anything the only damage to it is that the graves has slightly shifted to the left

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:27.080
 And that's that's been peddled around everywhere and there's no evidence for it

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:31.800
 There's some not true car marx facts actually though speaking of car marx. They did find out something quite funny last week

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:38.440
 listening to the diana abbot interview so for international listeners diana abbot one of rmp's got herself in trouble

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:40.520
 Um in the last couple of weeks

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:44.040
 But she got herself in trouble on a podcast where she was being interviewed about her life

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:49.320
 And she went out with jeremy corbin and she was talking about the early days of their relationship

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:54.680
 And she said that um, she used to whine and whine and whine saying you never you never take me out

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:59.160
 We never go anywhere. We never do anything and so he said, okay, I'll treat you fine. Finally

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:02.840
 And she really she probably got all dressed up doled up

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:08.280
 I got really excited, you know cancel the plans for that evening and he took her to high gate cemetery to look at car marx's grave

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:10.600
 Wow

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:15.320
 That was when she thought how you would have liked that, wouldn't you? You would have missed nothing

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:21.400
 I've had grave dates. Yeah, I've done those. I went to see uh, william mcgonagles grave on a date once

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:23.720
 Did you where is he buried edinburgh?

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:27.400
 See yeah, long way to go for a date. Oh, yeah, it was a cost of time

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:31.720
 Did the other person appreciate it? She actually got off the train at about

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:35.160
 I'm the tape rich

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.160
 Please fall again

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:40.120
 Quite an esoteric joke that

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.320
 Perfect

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:43.320
 Internationalists have all turned off at this point

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:50.280
 Interesting. Is it true about car marx's grave that um, is it herbert spencer who he really hated is buried right next to him?

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:55.640
 Yeah, it's on the opposite side. So they're basically looking at each other. I'm smelling sitcom. Yeah, marx and spencer

00:19:55.640 --> 00:20:05.640
 Uh, I've got another fact here. This is sent in by daniel atkinson who's recently got into watching sumo

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:13.720
 And so has consumed a ton of sumo information. Uh, so he says sumo wrestlers have to take taxis and ride bikes everywhere

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:19.240
 This is because there are so many sumo related car accidents that the sumo federation has banned them

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.800
 So they're banned because they're terrible at driving

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:25.400
 Well, what the problem is is that when one sumo wrestler in a car hits another one

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:29.960
 They then just will keep driving until they've driven the other one off the road. Like that's the really sad bit

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:33.240
 Those sorry they get bikes

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:37.800
 That's gotta look silly those tires have got to withstand quite the pressure

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:41.480
 That's a good point. I've never seen a sumo on a bike. Have you? No

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:47.480
 But we don't live in japan. Maybe in japan they're telling plenty. Yeah, um, it's possible

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:52.360
 I um, I've been to the yearly final of sumo in tokyo

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:58.200
 Uh, and I reckon that they all turn because they're all I think they're all quite rich aren't they sumo wrestlers these days

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:01.800
 They all had cars that were taken them in because we saw some of them arrive

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:05.720
 Oh, okay. If you didn't see anyone wobbling along, I'm like stabilizers

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:08.920
 We've done so many good facts about sumo over the years

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:13.320
 Do you remember the one about the guy who had the top of his head altered because he needed to get the height requirement

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:18.600
 In order to become a sumo. Do you have stuff put in? Yeah, it's like it was like basically like a lump of fat

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:23.080
 It was like a yeah, like a breast implant basically just put in the top of his skull and then

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.720
 Sexy. Yeah

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.440
 And then there was the um the fact that the

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:33.480
 The judges all carry a knife on them in case they make a wrong call out of honor

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:38.120
 They have to kill themselves on the spot. Yeah, I just wasn't having that often anymore

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:43.080
 And what how wrong does the call have to be is it like I give him a four for that? No a three

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:47.400
 Here's a good fact from matt fischer

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.600
 After serving a four-year prison term for forging the hitler diaries

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:54.680
 Conrad kujou began selling authentic forgeries under his own name

00:21:55.080 --> 00:22:00.520
 He often had to authenticate his forgeries because other fordgers were selling forged authentic comrad kujou forgeries

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.520
 Wow

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.520
 And I did a bit more digging on this and basically

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:10.840
 He came out of prison. He did a little bit of time and then he set up a shop selling forged

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:18.120
 Is it uh horn mirror paintings and maybe some fake darlings as well, but he was acknowledging they were fake

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:21.560
 Um, it's pretty easy to fake a mirror. Is it?

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:24.920
 It's just circles and triangles aren't they? Miro Miro on the wall

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:30.120
 Not relevant

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:34.600
 But basically I found out how he got into forging the hitler diaries. Okay, that's quite a thing to do, isn't it? He

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:41.080
 Collected a lot of Nazi memorabilia. Okay. He was an avid collector of Nazi memorabilia. Hmm. Always a good sign

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:49.400
 He bought and the prices in the west were way higher than they were in east germany or west germany because obviously there's

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:53.400
 You know demand overseas and it wasn't legal. So he often got his stuff confiscated

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:57.080
 And I guess there was more available in on the german market, you know, than there wasn't in the west

00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:01.480
 So he then started forging authentication details for his stuff to make it more valuable

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:04.280
 So like he got a first world war helmet which was a real first world war helmet

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:07.880
 And he said oh, this was hitler's helmet and here's a certificate saying it interesting

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:13.320
 And then he started doing stationary and letters and they were really primitive. They were aged with tea

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:17.160
 And you know, they were like children's school projects, but he was getting better and better

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:22.760
 And then he started doing um, I don't really remember much about that story, but like people fell for it

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:25.480
 Did they yeah, they were published for it. Somebody times bought them

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:30.280
 Really the hitler diary was embarrassing. It was one of the most embarrassing things

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:33.720
 To ever happen to a newspaper

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:39.720
 But they were partly full because there were 61 volumes available. Whoa. I know he did a lot of writing

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:44.760
 Why did that make it the more easily fooled? I would have thought it was sunny times, but hitler was a busy man

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:48.920
 How did he have time to write all this? I think if you just give them one page that goes

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:54.120
 Oh, can we invade Poland tomorrow? Yeah, then they might think oh, yeah, this is just been knocked up by someone

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:58.280
 Exactly that. But if it's 60 volumes of him saying bloody Stalin

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:03.640
 But 61, that's a hell of an investment of time if you suddenly hand it over and someone goes this is a fake

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:08.760
 Nine years writing those

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:11.400
 I was born with a tiny mustache

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.480
 [Laughter]

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:22.840
 For at least 300 years one common insult against a king was that they had pooed in the font while being baptised

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:28.520
 This is according to Cass L and they read it in a book called The Anglo-Saxons by Matt Morris

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:31.000
 And they're referring to Ethel Red the Unready

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.600
 Right

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:38.760
 So yeah, people didn't really rate him very much and they thought we're just gonna make this up about him as far as I know

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:41.560
 He didn't poo in the font. What was the nappy situation back then?

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:46.280
 Great question. Well, Sumo hadn't been invented

00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:49.960
 What were they wearing? Cloth, I guess

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:53.080
 I think a lot of kids would just go without

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:57.800
 It would be cold, wouldn't it? The king, I would think, would have a royal diaper

00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:04.520
 Yeah, swaddling cloths? I think that was a person like you are you just carry get shadow and get pissed on

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:07.480
 I'm the royal diaper

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:13.720
 So would they dunk the whole baby in I'm just thinking of the baptisms that my kids have had and it's very much water over the head

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.160
 Oh, they often would dunk in

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:16.440
 Right, so you go full

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:19.640
 Traditionally a proper baptism your head should go under really

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:22.520
 Is that your head? Yeah, like a water body

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:25.560
 This is not precisely how water body works

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:27.240
 You're not demanding information from them

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:31.560
 Do you know what? I've never been to a baptism and I've never touched wood. I've never been water-boarded

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:35.560
 Do you deny the devil?

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:38.840
 At all his penions screw you copper

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:45.560
 Do you remember I told you guys that thing of when willful was being baptised what happened to me?

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:49.080
 So I was I was handed to him. Oh, you shattered the photo

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:51.960
 Wife I got to pull my nappy

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:56.120
 So I was I was holding him and I had to read a piece out

00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:58.520
 So I was holding will reading a piece out from a bit of paper

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:03.080
 And I then had to put the paper down behind me on the table and then hold willful two hands

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.160
 So I put the paper down behind me and I came back

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:09.080
 And the guy started reading the prayers and I just suddenly was like, oh my god

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:10.680
 Something's on fire

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:15.080
 What the hell is on fire and I turned around to see and the paper wasn't touching and there were a few candles there

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:20.360
 And I looked down and my arm hair was lit up because I'd gone over a candle as I did it. Yeah

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:25.880
 I was on fire. I mean it was you know slowly going out, but I had to I mean it does feel like the devils had

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:32.280
 Something to do with that doesn't it? So mr. Shriver, do you believe in god? I do why you want fire?

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.280
 Then

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:37.800
 Can someone cover that crucifix please?

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:47.480
 There's a species of finch

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:52.360
 That's named after a guy called finch. What a great fact. Lovely great little fact from

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:55.480
 Well, and you've said it's from someone called Colin sir name

00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:04.200
 Wow, and the surname was named after Colin's mother, yeah, I think Colin signed his email Colin sir name

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:11.960
 He must have so that's odd from you Colin. Uh, but great fact nonetheless. It is correct. Maybe he's from Surinab and it just

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:19.960
 So there's a finch called the finch, but no one knows it's named after them because it's just called the finch

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:26.840
 Is it called the finch finch? Uh, well that it's called finch's euphonia. In fact, um, and it's in the finch family

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.200
 I've got one of the name fact. This is from hannah wallis of florida

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:34.520
 Uh, the discography of 98 year old jazz musician dick hyman

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:38.200
 Includes the 1966 album. I'll never be the same

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:42.680
 Some of hyman's other albums include the sensuous piano of d

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:46.280
 and the man from or g an

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:51.080
 The man from organ. We've met him before haven't we? Have we friend of the podcast?

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:57.160
 I'm sure, I'm sure we have a dick hyman. My friends used to have a comedy double act called dick and hyman

00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:01.960
 But that was that was their names really? Yeah, it makes me because a dick hyman like you don't know what that would be

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.360
 They didn't normally have them

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:13.000
 No, molly macanerni writes that um an engineer refurbishing and installing old cine-operated pay phones

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.360
 That person's name is patrick schlott

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:22.200
 However, the coring slots will not actually be used because the public phone service will be free

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:25.720
 Oh, okay, but I assume he's worked on other schlottes

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:32.520
 100% schlott. It's such a good surname. It's really good. Schlott. Her name is schlott. You go for casino afterwards. That's what I do

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:36.040
 Yeah, pat schlott is what jane fond would do at a casino

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:39.960
 Pat schlott. Pat the schlott. It's a Sean Connery joke

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:45.720
 Yeah, but what's the pat? Well, you have to you have to you have to you have to test all electronic items

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.800
 You have to pat test them

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:49.800
 I'm just gonna pat the schlott

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:54.200
 Shaky so she's chasing absolutely poor boys not so satisfied with it

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:57.320
 I'm not sure about this Bond movie

00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:01.560
 Why should I said no there again?

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:11.880
 Mark Weldon Low says that the granddaughter a famous artist david shepherd is a lamb and that's her married name. She's called lamb

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:14.840
 And her grandfather was shepherd

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:19.080
 That's very good. Uh, I go on here from jake from illinois. Yeah

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:25.080
 Who says when the ferris wheel debuted at the columbian world exposition in 1893 in chicago?

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:30.840
 They needed to expedite the painting process supposedly francis davis millett. What?

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:37.560
 Was it that they just held a paintbrush at the bottom and let the wheel go around so they didn't have to move?

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:40.120
 That's how I would do it. That makes total sense. Yeah

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:45.240
 Uh, well supposedly what actually happened was francis davids millett

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:47.400
 Who was the decorations director?

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.480
 Invented spray paint

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:56.440
 Specifically so that the ferris wheel could be done in time. Oh really? Yeah here is quite a nice one

00:29:56.440 --> 00:30:03.720
 It's from john o'connell jr. And it's a little like the nadal tennis racket stretching fact

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:06.600
 In that it's got a distance in it. It's also a stretch

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:13.880
 Well, this is a this one is true though. I have I've followed it up. So john says since french guiana is part of france

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:19.080
 I don't really know much about french guiana. I know it's in south america. I know it's near the top and I know it's um

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:24.680
 I saw you really need to know what else do you expect to know what it's exactly the number of dogs living there

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:28.760
 Like, you know, it's main export chief exports. I don't know the chief export

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:32.680
 Cain sugar probably maybe but 41% of it is amazonian

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:37.240
 Rainforest, uh-huh. It's very rain foresty. Anyway, it is but it is part of france

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:41.640
 In legal terms. Uh-huh. Yeah, it's one of the departement, right?

00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:44.040
 Well, I didn't know that even really

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:48.440
 So since french guiana is part of france john writes and france is part of the european union

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:53.400
 The largest national park in the eu is in south america not in europe, which I like

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:56.040
 It's the biggest national park is

00:30:56.040 --> 00:31:01.480
 Is there uh following on from this brazil is the country with which france shares its longest land border

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:07.800
 Yeah, I did not I thought what about germany and spain. They're massive and they're both shorter than the brazil french guiana border

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:12.200
 Yeah, that's a really great fact. It's kind of a little bit. It comes up in quizzes a fair bit that one

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:19.240
 I once went to a reunion, which is an island in the is in the pacific or the south atlantic or somewhere

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:23.880
 No, it's in the indian ocean

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:29.240
 Isn't it it's just in the east of africa it's just in the east of africa

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:31.880
 But that's also a french departement

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:37.480
 So you don't need to go through any security to go between them or any passport control

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:42.600
 And I think it's the world's longest domestic flight that goes from charles to go

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:47.640
 It was something like 14 hours and does that come up in quizzes

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:51.080
 That one i'm not so sure. I'd never heard it before in a quiz

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:56.200
 Do you ever worry that going to lots of quizzes as you do blunts your sense of wonder at the most amazing facts in the world?

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:58.280
 I'm not sure. I ever had a sense of wonder

00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:04.280
 Um, although this really shook me to the core a message from jake

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:10.600
 Uh, who had been to the kelvin grove museum in glasgo and learned that people would chisel off

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:13.720
 Penises of the gods to use as aphrodisiacs

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:16.360
 Hmm in ancient egypt

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:22.040
 Ah, okay. Okay. They eat them or snort them or it's it's not clear

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:26.600
 To be honest, but I think you would use sprinkler on your ice cream round and sprinkled. Yeah

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:32.120
 At first I thought he was saying that they use them as dildos and I thought that would be interesting

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:34.600
 I do certainly did. Yeah, very interesting

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:42.280
 That explains why you got kicked out of looking at the elke marbles

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:46.600
 Penises of the gods is a very evocative phrase

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:52.680
 Yeah, there's something about it feels well. It's like eric von danakins. Um, what's this book chariots of the gods chariots of the gods

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:55.400
 Yeah, it's a sequel

00:32:55.400 --> 00:33:00.120
 And they were quite small then so actually maybe it wouldn't I think I think because there wasn't this big, um

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:04.280
 Owners on penis size. Were they big statues? Oh, would you mean there were tiny statues?

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:06.840
 penis size

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:09.960
 I actually think like there are some egyptian gods that had quite large penises

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:14.040
 Oh, the egyptian gods had really big penises. I'm sorry. Did you say barbie?

00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:16.920
 B-a-b-i

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:21.080
 It was like a the monkey god who would take you across to the underworld

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:24.600
 And he had a a penis that could be used as a sail

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:31.320
 So kens or an or to hold up the sail so or mast. I've asked. Yeah, because a ken doesn't get a penis, but barbie does

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:36.200
 That's there we go. Very good. Did we talk about the destruction of the herms?

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:40.520
 Because the herms were all they were greek statues, I think and they were

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:45.080
 A bust of a head and shoulders, but then they did have a little willy sticking out in front

00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:48.680
 And they were fertility things and I'm sure there was a period in greece which was the

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:54.520
 The demolition of the herms when athens was invaded by someone or other all the herms got chiseled off. Yeah

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.240
 Well, I think that was quite common that you would if you went to a place and you wanted to

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:00.440
 disfigure their gods

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:03.560
 You would kind of disfigure the faces, but you would also cut off the genitals

00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:06.120
 But that's just what you do today as well. Listen. I mean that's a lot

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:10.760
 It's like the obvious thing to do you see a statue with genitals, which bit you're gonna take

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:15.000
 You'll take the willy. No fair enough. Yeah. What were the herms? I've never heard of these things

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.360
 What were they attached to if it was just a head and shoulders and then was it sticking out with the neck?

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:20.600
 It was like a column of marble, you know, it was like a column of marble

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:23.080
 Shoulders penis flaw penis flaw

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:29.480
 Uh, yeah, it's a column and then they had like a tiny little willy like as if you were

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:33.480
 Using it to get water out of like a water cooler kind of thing. I see

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:37.800
 Yeah, like a stick man. They just couldn't be asked to draw the rest of the body. Look, it looks like that

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.560
 Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah

00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:43.400
 So it is the only it's really the only prominent bit that you can remove

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:46.760
 So it's an obvious target for vandals and hooligans like you, Anna. Yeah

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:49.800
 I've done I've got 20 of them

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:54.440
 Um, I have a very long email

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:57.880
 Uh, not all of which I'm going to read which actually it doesn't seem to have come

00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:00.040
 Signed off by anyone

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:04.600
 Which is a shame because they've discovered something amazing. I might not have copied. Does it say Andy Murray at the top there?

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:09.160
 Yeah, it's from some no, that's from someone else called Andy Murray. Well, that's very confusing

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:11.560
 Did they happen to have the same email address as you?

00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:16.920
 Let's move on. What are they saying? They're long, but I doubt not fascinating email

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:25.720
 This person's brandy called Andy Murray has worked out how to get rid of hiccups. So, um, he said skipping out the first nine paragraphs

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:29.800
 No, it's very good. He said that when he was 13 in school biology

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:34.360
 He learned what causes hiccups and he thought he hypothesized a way to stop it

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:39.160
 Should be doing a burp as you feel the first hiccup coming

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:42.760
 And he can report that after 45 years of doing that

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:45.240
 He's only ever hiccups once

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:49.320
 But I never feel my first hiccup coming. You've got to be on the lookout all the time

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:55.720
 It was vigilance. It does. Yeah, it does. But then he did say he lost his concentration

00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:59.000
 once on the 28th of november 1990

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.560
 This was also in the Hitler time. This is kind of detail

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:11.320
 I think it was a memorable day for anyone who was an adult at the time because it was the joyful day as he describes it

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:16.680
 That thatch resigned and he said he was part of a small group of archaeologists digging this Salisbury

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:20.760
 And when they found out they started celebrating got incredibly drunk

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:24.120
 He was so happy so drunk on cider that he forgot to burp in time

00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:30.680
 And he proceeded to hiccup non-stop for 24 hours having obviously saved up all these hiccups

00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:33.560
 A lifetime. Yeah, lifetime swimming. Yeah

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:36.680
 That whole thing sounds like a cautionary tale, doesn't it?

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:43.240
 Of the man who suppressed his hiccups and then hiccups forever. You're so right

00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:49.960
 That's a that's a Grimm's fairy tale or an esoph's fable or something. I would definitely be up for 61 more volumes of this guy's diary

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:52.200
 This is awesome stuff

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:55.960
 Here's something from Kate Evans

00:36:55.960 --> 00:37:02.440
 She tells us that when Leeds became a city for the first time so Leeds and Yorkshire

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:04.920
 They didn't have any celebrations

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:10.520
 And that is because they only applied because they heard that Sheffield was planning to apply as well

00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:16.680
 And thought well since we're the largest city in Yorkshire, we should be a city before Sheffield are so they quickly applied

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:20.120
 They won and then they didn't have any time to prepare the celebrations

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:27.400
 Or maybe they're from Yorkshire, so they're so tight they decided they didn't want to have any parties

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:35.320
 Um, that's good. I like a I like a city rivalry. Yeah, I'm a big fan of that. What's your favourite?

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:39.640
 Um, I don't have any really local to me because I'm from London

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:44.920
 Where's the rivalry? London and the entire rest of the UK. You're Oxbridge though

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:50.200
 So you were part of like a major the Cambridge Oxbridge library people don't really care about that not properly

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:55.720
 No, unless you're it may shock you to know that Andy's not a rower if you're listening and so I don't think

00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:00.040
 Why would that why would listeners not think I was a rower? They think you're a cox

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:09.000
 Sox on them I rode on the coxless force and that was a very painful team to get into I must say good lord

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:16.200
 Andy is so much of a cox that he got destroyed by the Phoenician empire. Wow

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:18.920
 Okay

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:21.960
 Um, no do rowers care about that really? I mean they do for the boat race

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:26.600
 Let's move on let's move on. I'd love our UK version of roast shows

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:33.320
 I don't think Jimmy Carr will be signing on to hope this one

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:36.840
 Oh dear

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:46.920
 Um, I've got a fact about Wieners. This is from Ralph Lynn Sangon

00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:52.760
 And it says in brackets repeat. I don't know if that means repeat the name Ralph Lynn Sangon Lynn Sangon

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:54.920
 Or if it means the email is repeated

00:38:54.920 --> 00:39:00.280
 But anyway, he headlines it by saying cybernetic Wieners are only possible because of dr. Wiener

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:05.640
 Quite confusing because I'm always a bit confused about the word cybernetic and what it actually doesn't mean anything does it?

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:11.800
 No, well, so I looked up and it doesn't doesn't really I'm out cybernetics is a study of automatic control and information exchange

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:14.120
 Sort of between machines and living things

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:19.880
 So that so I think it's related to prosthetics. So if you've got a prosthetic penis that can be remote controlled or something

00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:23.880
 I'll do something it's in remote control. Wow. Yeah, that would be cool, wouldn't it?

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:27.160
 Sorry, I just need to pull the batteries out and rub them a few times

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:34.360
 This guy's called Norbert Wiener Dr. Norbert Wiener. Oh, I've heard of him. Yeah, I think he's quite a big deal

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:39.000
 so he was the he was the founder of cybernetics, which is a big deal and um

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.640
 That was the runner-up name that lost out to James Bond

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:45.400
 But it was going to be the names of wiener norbert wiener

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:51.320
 It's a fun fun trivia fact and it would be sexy if that would happen that would be a sexy name right now

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:53.560
 Norbert wiener and patch lot

00:39:53.560 --> 00:40:02.200
 He sounds he sounds very cool norbert wiener and worth more than uh, we're making it sound like he learned 34 languages apparently

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:06.520
 Um, uh, graduated college 14 got phd at 17

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:10.360
 He was known as the most remarkable boy in the world in 1906

00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:14.360
 But maybe the reason you've heard of him James is that he came up with the wiener sausage

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:16.200
 So he was a mathematician

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:23.000
 Oh and in the and i'm just going to read this out and good luck ever grasping it get a phd in the mathematical field of probability

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:31.000
 The wiener sausage is something that can be visualized as a sausage of fixed radius whose centerline is brownie in motion

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.720
 Uh, we have talked a bit about brownie emotion on the show

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:38.600
 But anyway, he he came up with this mathematical concept that was named after him

00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:43.400
 So it looks like a sausage in maths. Yeah, and it's named after him. So it's called the wiener sausage. Got it

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:45.880
 You know math. I'm just a fun too. Yeah

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:49.240
 And he was responsible for the cybernetic

00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:56.040
 and he he founded cybernetics and so uh, um machine human interfaces and stuff like that of which

00:40:56.040 --> 00:41:00.680
 Prosthetic penises could be seen as an extension. I think is what the person is saying

00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:03.480
 Okay, so he wasn't a penis technician himself

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:06.520
 No more than any of us are

00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:11.000
 Yeah, uh, I got I got something here from jessica cluckus. I think that's how you pronounce it

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:16.120
 Uh, she's from the island man and she says I am surprises not come up more on the pod

00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:23.080
 So here are some facts that I love pilates were invented in patrick, which is a local town in the island man

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:25.080
 Is that true? I didn't know that

00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:27.320
 Halloween does not exist there

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:29.800
 Well, I guess you don't have to do everything quite right too

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:33.560
 But it also doesn't exist in the Murray household

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:37.000
 Yeah, because I'm I've turned off the lights and I'm lying on the floor

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.360
 Which actually would be a great position to spook people from but I don't I don't do that in case local kids come around and

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:43.800
 You know alarm me

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:48.520
 She says we were the first to give women the vote and have the oldest continuing running parliament in the world

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:50.680
 How ironic of the isle of man

00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:57.320
 What about jeff the talking mongoose he is from the island man. Yes

00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:02.120
 The ghostly mongoose is that why they don't have halloween because he scared everyone

00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:05.240
 It's too real. It's too many bad memories. Yeah

00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:11.960
 That was like a young teenage girl or something who pretended that she was talking to a ghostly mongoose

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:17.560
 And then got all of the newspapers involved and everyone believed it and probably cone and dial did or someone like that

00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:21.560
 Oh, yeah, yeah, I think all the biggest like ghost hunters of the time went to investigate it as well

00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:23.400
 So it was yeah, it's quite there's a great biog on it

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:27.640
 It was quite a big scandal we covered it ages ago and the bbc got involved in a way that meant they had to change

00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:30.120
 All their regulations when it turned out it was fake or something

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:33.720
 That's right bbc scandals used to be certainly more wholesome

00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:39.640
 Yeah, they were more fun. Actually jeff the talking mongoose also used to get his penis out at parties. Oh

00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:42.680
 jeff jeff

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:47.640
 Um, do you said pilates was invented on the isle of man? I'm really surprised about that

00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:53.400
 What am I remembering this right or wrong that it was invented by someone called like tony pilates

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:56.520
 It was it was invented by mr. Pilates who I don't think was from the isle of man

00:42:56.680 --> 00:43:03.880
 Like bitcrame yoga was invented by he wasn't tony, but mr. Bitcrame. Yeah. Yeah. I just think that's I love those things

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:06.920
 Unexpected things named after people german

00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:10.120
 Um, chocolate cake is named after a guy called german

00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:13.240
 Brilliant brilliant that kind of stuff. Yeah

00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:18.520
 So according to just a super quick google while you guys were chatting pilates was developed by joseph pilates

00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:19.640
 He was from germany

00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:25.960
 His father was a gymnast and his mother a naturopath pilates said the inspiration for his method came to him during world war one

00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:28.680
 While he was being held at a camp in the isle of man

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:33.400
 Can I just say that I don't think it's really fair for the isle of man to claim that as one of their

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:37.800
 When the person who invented it was being held prisoner there. I think

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:39.880
 That's fair

00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:41.880
 We're torturing it out of him in the end

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:46.360
 Maybe he was coming up with those positions to try and escape. We don't know

00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:50.440
 That was the only way he could get under the fence was by blanking for seven minutes

00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:54.440
 Um, here's a great one. This is from nat edwards

00:43:55.160 --> 00:44:01.480
 Who is master of the armories at the royal armories in leeds. Very cool. What a cool thing

00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:04.680
 So here we go. This is the fact in the late 19th and early 20th centuries

00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:11.720
 Special guns were popular among cyclists, especially in france belgium and spain for shooting bothersome dogs

00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:13.240
 Oh, yeah

00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:16.280
 Cyclists would have guns marketed to them and this was invented

00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:18.440
 Uh, the velo dog

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:22.760
 A new kind of ammunition that could be fired from small lightweight powerful revolvers

00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:26.440
 Allowing that they were not very accurate. Uh, and they were called dog revolvers

00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:32.520
 One of them was even used in an attempt to assassinate king alfonso the 13th who survived possibly on account of not being a dog

00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:39.240
 Um, because we've um been researching this for qi weirdly this year or last year and water pistols were invented

00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:44.600
 For scaring dogs as well the first adverts you see for water pistols in the newspapers were

00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:47.240
 Use this to get rid of dogs and it was for cyclists

00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:50.760
 So that make water pistol makes sense to me like you've got a troublesome dog

00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:55.400
 You're on your bike. You don't want to you know an actual gun for a dog feels a bit

00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:59.560
 Do you shoot it or do you try and scare it or do you pistol whip it?

00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:03.800
 And when I say whip it, I mean that's the type of dog you're

00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:06.440
 I think the idea was to shoot them

00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:09.320
 I think it's dogs like water so the water pistols probably not that successful

00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:12.920
 They probably just went for more and more if I splurged the water pistol at my mum's dog

00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:14.920
 It would just want to eat the water

00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:15.640
 So

00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:17.640
 Mum's dog is very stupid though

00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:19.800
 You need to grade up

00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:25.000
 To machine gun. Yeah. There's a good fact here from luka from isli. I'm going to do it as a riddle

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:31.960
 There's a golf course where you can hit the ball and it stays in the air for an hour and three seconds

00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:34.920
 nuclear quantum

00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:37.000
 um

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000
 Intangley

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.000
 No, no, no go on the intangrel thing

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:48.600
 It's very simple it lands in the higgs bosons. Have you hit it around?

00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:51.320
 Yeah

00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:55.960
 It's time zones. Yeah, do you know this one? Oh, that's cool. I haven't heard of it. No, it's a green zone

00:45:55.960 --> 00:46:01.320
 Golf course and it straddles finland and sweden and there are seven holes in finland and 11 in sweden

00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:05.320
 So on hole six you hit the ball and it stays in the air for an hour

00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:10.360
 That's great. You know what I have heard of that golf course, but I haven't thought of the time zone part of it

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:14.440
 That's so good. That's good for a crime. So I'm just going to say it for an alibi

00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:20.120
 Where were you? I was here for an hour wait for the ball to come down. So I couldn't have killed him

00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:22.440
 Obvious

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:24.440
 I think it was the quantum physicist

00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:30.200
 Funny pain and funny. That was a kick of a crap out of a quantum physicist over here

00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:39.000
 Um, I wasn't going to mention this one, but I will because it's related to james bond. We've been mentioning uh that bit

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.720
 Andy coming has sent this in uh two facts

00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:46.280
 William stevensson the man james bond was fashioned after who was from winnipeg

00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:51.080
 So I think andy coming's from canada once escaped prison using a can opener

00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:54.360
 Yes, and says this only bends the truth a touch

00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:57.000
 Now I didn't look into that because I wasn't going to read that

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.120
 I thought james bond was modelled after quite a few other people as well

00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:04.680
 Um, I think there's a few different people isn't there like for instance james bond the

00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:07.800
 Ornithologist yes in fleming had a cool older brother

00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:11.960
 Oh, I think did lots of expeditions and travel and big game hunting and stuff like that. Yeah, that's right

00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:12.520
 I might have been part of it

00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:15.640
 But do we know what happened with the tin up there because I wasn't going to read it

00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:19.000
 I was going to bring in his next fact, which I thought was quite a far one

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.200
 So he sent two two fun facts the city of regina

00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:25.320
 Briefly had the slogan the city that rhymes with fun

00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:29.960
 As you might imagine people were fired

00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:34.040
 That's really good

00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:40.200
 I actually I have another one from uh, steven corcoran of exclamation marks fact fame. Oh, yeah, okay

00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:43.720
 Non fact fame. Yes. Well, this is this is a good one

00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:47.720
 It's that a british officer captured during the first world war was granted leave

00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:51.720
 To visit his dying mother on one condition that he returned

00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:58.440
 This is about a captain called robert cambell. He was captured really early in the first world war august 1914

00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:00.040
 I mean just such bad luck

00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:03.560
 You know you got to set out the whole thing and he got word when he was in a prisoner of war camp

00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:07.800
 That his mum was dying and he wrote to the kaiser saying look can I please go and visit my mother?

00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:11.560
 I will come back and the kaiser said yes, but you got to come back

00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:15.800
 And he went he went home. He went to kent, which must have been such a weird experience

00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:18.120
 Spend a week with his mum

00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:22.040
 Kind of saying goodbye and then he went back to prison voluntarily

00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:26.040
 Then as soon as he got back he started digging a tunnel for the next nine months

00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:32.120
 Then escaped via and then was recaptured again. Anyway, good on him. He wanted to escape the uh the honorable way, yeah

00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:37.080
 Oh, yeah, completely. Yeah, yeah, and I'm sorry. It's good back though because you just seem they just chase you down

00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:40.360
 They know where your mum lives. They know where you live. Yeah, but you're left with Germans

00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:42.440
 They're at war with the place where you are

00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:49.560
 Yeah, I've overestimated how easy it was to just send one of them then over to kent for a point

00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:50.280
 Per point

00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:54.760
 I think he thought that if he didn't go back other prisoner exchanges might not happen

00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:58.520
 That they just end the whole system and anyway, he lived until 1966

00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:01.240
 Did he yeah? Yeah, what month?

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:05.880
 Just wondering if he saw the world cup. What month was the world cup? It was in the summer

00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:11.000
 The report I found said he died in the isle of wight in july 1966 age 81

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:17.240
 That would have been tight. It would have been tight. He might have seen the qualifying the earlier rounds in the tournament

00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:20.760
 They think it's all of oh it is

00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:26.760
 Who did england be in that match? West Germany. Oh, so it would have been. What a beautiful

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:34.920
 I've got to find out if he saw the world cup. I mean, he saw the victory in the first world war and the second which was arguably

00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:38.520
 You know, he'll have cared more about we don't even know if he liked football. We know he liked war

00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:43.800
 Did he like war? Was that why they altered it?

00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:47.080
 Um from ana ridpath

00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:52.520
 That's just a nice bit of trivia. She says my friend Nathan is a big fan of baseball. So this is credited to Nathan

00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:58.040
 There was a single baseball player called danny Janssen who played for two teams in a single game. How?

00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:01.240
 Oh, this is uh, very simple quantum

00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:10.120
 Do you want to carry on or shall I answer please the game was postponed halfway through any move between teams?

00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:15.560
 I'm really sorry that jamesy's on killing all of your scientific theorising. I'll get at one of these days

00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:17.800
 One of these days is going to be quantum

00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:20.040
 Still another alibi to you, Andy

00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:22.920
 I wasn't even on that team. I couldn't have killed him

00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:30.840
 Yeah, you're absolutely correct. Uh, the it was postponed because uh in clement weather

00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:34.360
 And he was traded from the toronto blue jay to the boston red socks

00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:35.560
 Wow

00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:37.820
 And then uh, he was put in a particle accelerator
