 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

3
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,160
 from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with James

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,520
 Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and Anna Tushinsky and once again we have gathered around the microphones

5
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:37,280
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go. Starting

6
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,920
 with you, Anna. My fact this week is that during out-of-hours periods hospital CT scanners are

7
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:53,360
 sometimes used to scan Egyptian mummies. Wow, so cool. It's so weird this is um because mummies

8
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,880
 need scanning sometimes to find out what's inside them so it's much less invasive as you can imagine

9
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:04,080
 than actually unwrapping a mummy which can sort of cause the mummies to disintegrate as you do it

10
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,600
 and you want to know what jewels they've got in them or what state their bones are in stuff like that

11
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,200
 and about well actually almost since the dawn of x-rays they realized this would be really useful

12
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,240
 for scanning mummies and since the year 2000 apparently it's been a routine use for hospital

13
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,760
 CT scanners is to use them on mummies there are various hospitals in the UK that do it I think

14
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,320
 Manchester Children's Hospital does a very strong line in loaning its CT scanners out.

15
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,800
 I remember I think it was Leeds Hospital I can't remember exactly but I read one of them saying

16
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,360
 that they did it in the night or out of hours because they didn't want to scare the patients

17
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,480
 which I think makes sense doesn't it? I love the idea of seeing the previous patient coming out

18
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,840
 and then being desiccated and they're 2000 years old I'm not going in there.

19
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:55,120
 I think it looks a bit late for that one to be honest so the scounds necessary.

20
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:00,640
 So this one was in Spain right the specific story that you sent around to us because I found this

21
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,760
 very specific one very fascinating the fact that this was a project that was done between

22
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,560
 the Spanish National Museum of Archaeology and one of the university hospitals and they wanted to

23
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,600
 scan three of the mummies that they had trying to identify who they were and really cool thing about

24
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:21,920
 it is that they had to map out a specific route from the museum to the hospital so that they

25
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,160
 went on roads that had no bumps on them so that they didn't damage the mum you know you don't want

26
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,280
 to hit a speed bump break your mummy in half on the way. That's pretty sweet I once broke a rib

27
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,080
 and I got a taxi home because I didn't realize I broke my rib and it's the most pain that I've ever

28
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,320
 been in because the speed bumps everywhere in London isn't there yeah and tax drivers don't seem

29
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:45,360
 to care about them and it was just every time you went over one it killed and then I read a bit later

30
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,760
 that they thought they might use speed bumps as a way of telling if you've got appendicitis

31
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,440
 so it's a really good way of telling because the speed bumps hurt you so much if you've got

32
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,800
 something like appendicitis that it's almost as good a way of diagnosing it as almost any other

33
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,840
 non-invasive way. Wow I think these are great though we should release these as part of GPS

34
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,520
 sort of like Egyptologists should release the routes that have no bumps so that like not just

35
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:18,880
 people with broken ribs but mummies to be you know pregnant women they can't go over bumps as well

36
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,560
 you know we should be using this for a footage well no I mean it's not good for you it's not good

37
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,280
 for you to go but it's so funny because you've got a bump and yet you can't go over a bump the bump

38
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,400
 is within you already that is funny you should only have one one bump should never meet another

39
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,480
 that's the rule the Spanish ones are really cool because they there were some Egyptian mummies and

40
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,920
 there were some guanchi mummies which are ancient people from Tenerife and I didn't know that people

41
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,240
 from Tenerife got turned into mummies they were buried in caves and the naturally dry air desiccated

42
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:53,360
 them and dried them out so yeah and the Egyptian one they got when they scanned they discovered

43
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,840
 that it was the Pharaoh Imhotep's high priest like what a score what a that's like to me that's like

44
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,600
 panini stickers like you're like oh yes it's like a shiny priest yeah exactly it's a shiny

45
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:11,200
 how did they tell that from a scan was he wearing a badge he was actually like weirdly he was wearing

46
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,720
 a lot of amulets and there were lots of adornments where they could piece together who he was uh

47
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,160
 from what he was wearing okay make sense because yeah they're often wrapped up with you know

48
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,320
 possessions like rubies and jewels and sapphires and things like that aren't they so the scan

49
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,400
 actually serves two purposes with the mummy you can see what they were buried with and so learn

50
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,880
 a lot about the rituals and then you can see into their bones and see kind of what injuries they had

51
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,880
 and so what sort of lives they led and also quite often you can see what it actually is so it turns

52
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,840
 out when things are mummified and we find them we don't always know even whether it's a human or an

53
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,800
 animal they brought one into the Kent Institute of Medicine and Surgery in 2018 which they all

54
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,040
 thought was a mummified bird and put it through the scanner and it turned out that it was a miscarried

55
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:01,360
 baby but that actually makes it the youngest mummy ever to be discovered that's amazing so it

56
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,800
 tells you a lot have you heard about the crocodile shaped mummy that they found no no this was brought

57
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,440
 in and it was i mean it was very clearly the shape of a crocodile it couldn't it was if it was a

58
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:17,200
 Christmas present under the tree you would think oh i'm getting a crocodile basically but they looked

59
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,280
 into it they scanned it right in the CT scanner and they discovered that it was not a crocodile

60
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:29,920
 can you guess what it was oh an alligator no um a human sticking their arms out in a crocodile

61
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:35,280
 mouth fashion oh yeah like an old school baby baby shark kind of like a baby shark impersonation

62
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:42,320
 yes yeah it was actually eight crocodiles it was eight small crocodiles which had been mummified

63
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,720
 in the shape of a big crocodile and i think this is where we get the cultural trope of the like

64
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,920
 three small people in an overcoat yeah exactly but they're trying to get into an adult crocodile

65
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:58,720
 movie crocodiles were hunted to be mummified as well weren't they which we didn't realize we

66
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,640
 kind of thought that they just mummified dead crocodiles as and when they came upon them

67
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:08,800
 but they've realized from CT scanning the mummified crocs they've realized that you

68
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,600
 you must have had sort of crocodile hunters who would have to go out and beat crocodiles to death

69
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:19,200
 and they smashed it the CT scan shows that their skulls have been smashed in and then rebuilt

70
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,320
 so you kill it by smashing in its skull but then you kind of need to make it look like a proper

71
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:27,760
 skull again it's not surprising they went for eight baby crocodiles they just came back saying oh

72
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:32,240
 yeah i got another crocodile here i've actually pre-mummified it so there's no need to examine

73
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:42,320
 very good um so CT scanners the the object themselves um a british invention at least

74
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:50,720
 half so from a guy called godfrey and houndsfield who in the 70s was awarded a Nobel prize for it

75
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:57,440
 and EMI were the people who developed the CT scanner and EMI is the very same EMI that is the

76
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:03,040
 music company and when they yeah when they were developing this they needed more money to sort

77
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:09,760
 of help the company to do this stuff and it just so happened that in 1957 EMI acquired capital

78
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:16,400
 records which allowed them to distribute british music into america and it's 1957 the beetles

79
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:22,000
 are about to arrive in 1962 a few years later and that is that helped raise the money for CT

80
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,200
 scanners so the beetles are partially responsible for the reason that we have CT scanners i've read

81
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:33,760
 quite a few places saying that's a myth and there's a paper which is called do we really need to thank

82
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:40,800
 the beetles for financing the development of the computed tomography scanner i don't know if that's

83
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:48,400
 the kind of tone that they had in mind when they wrote the title but they say um that EMI only paid

84
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:54,720
 about 100 000 pounds into the into the development of the CT scanner whereas the government paid

85
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,680
 in a lot more than that and so they say accordingly british taxpayers and officials of the british

86
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:05,280
 dhss are to be thanked for the CT scanner the beetles input into the world's culture is valuable

87
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,880
 but it does not require decoration by non-existent connection to the development of CT

88
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:16,480
 i don't know hear me out hear me out hear me out who was paying a lot of tax due to very very

89
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:22,320
 high government tax rates in the 1960s and 70s the beetles right the rod of stone's all they went

90
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:28,160
 to france it was the beetles i've got to say i do i do agree with them that i think these guys are

91
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,480
 being a little bit uppity in it and i think that the beetles you know it's 100 000 pounds and it

92
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,720
 was at the start as well they gave houndsfield the money at the top and then the government came

93
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,800
 in and gave them a lot more money later so i think it's kind of fair that the beetles had something

94
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:47,280
 to say but sorry what it was a record label investing in CT scanners well because EMI stands for

95
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:52,640
 electric and music industries and they originally an electrical and music company so they made

96
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:58,160
 electrics and they made music and so this was like the electrical side of their brand and they

97
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,800
 also did music stuff as well okay sounds legit yeah it sounds almost it's still loose i reckon but

98
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:11,120
 yeah good on them thank you beetles for saving so many lives rockets get CT scanned and that's to

99
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:17,440
 check that all their stuff is working so nasa and the navy use this system called actist systems

100
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:23,200
 which are special rocket CT scanners and they are specially rigged up to spot floors in like the

101
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:30,240
 engine parts and stuff like that and they doubled up as whale scanners very cool this guy called

102
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,880
 ted cranford who's a whale expert and he became obsessed with the idea that he really wanted

103
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:40,880
 to CT scan a whale and most whales don't fit into most conventional CT scanners and you could get

104
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:48,720
 six tiny whales and put them in a big whale suit doesn't make any sense you've got to go the other

105
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,000
 way round chop a whale into six parts uh anyway so first of all he needed to get hold of a whale

106
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,320
 so apparently his mates knew that he was looking for a big old whale head to scan and they found

107
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:04,240
 a dead sperm whale on a california beach and so these two friends of his borrowed a front end

108
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,600
 loader like one of those trucks from a construction company nearby cut the head off this whale carried

109
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,560
 it to a massive freezer somewhere in a marine laboratory in california called ted was like

110
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,440
 well look we've got your whale head what now and then ted was like okay cool we need to find a

111
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:25,840
 CT scanner and he convinced the navy to loan him their massive rocket scanner and it's revealed

112
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:31,280
 lots of cool stuff so the whole point is to find out about whale vocalization so sperm whale clicks

113
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:36,080
 are incredibly loud so he wants to look at how they make them and then how they hear and yeah

114
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:41,040
 now he just shoves marine animals through CT scanners all the time he said the um i was really

115
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:47,040
 an interview with him and he was saying he once was trying to dissect a dolphin head and he had to

116
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,160
 do it in a deep freezer so he has to wear freezer gear and go into the deep freezer to dissect this

117
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:58,960
 head uh but at the time the deep freeze was being shared by a giant skewer uh sort of swan-sized bird

118
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:04,800
 from antarctica oh skewer i thought yeah we're having a giant kebab at the end of the day

119
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,840
 no a skewer this this massive bird from the antarctic they just kept attacking him and

120
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:15,440
 vomiting on him for four days as he tried to dissect this oh it was alive why was it live

121
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,960
 in the freezer well it's from antarctic it's used to life exactly it wouldn't like it in the oven

122
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:28,480
 but what it was okay the dolphin's dead i thought the dolphin was alive the dolphin no dolphin's

123
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,280
 dead and it's not in water it's not in the wrong way around dolphin's dead in the freezer if you

124
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:38,720
 put a dolphin in the freezer it will die if it's not already uh skewer's life yeah but yeah he's

125
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,040
 a bit of a hero was the skewer kind of tied up do you think it must have been right that kind of

126
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:49,200
 just been what kind of sick messed up scientist ties up a skewer in a freezer i was thinking you

127
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,760
 know what i was thinking and yeah what i was thinking is and this won't go in but do you remember

128
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,160
 on your stag do when we did the escape room with the zombie who was tied up oh yeah i was just

129
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:04,560
 thinking that as well yes with the chain and he only gets so far i can imagine even more exciting

130
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:11,040
 if it was a skewer yeah yeah and then if the key is hidden inside the head of a dead dolphin but

131
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:22,560
 you have to get it into a c2 scanner to see where it is okay it's time for fact number two and that

132
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:29,120
 is my fact my fact this week is that in 1973 british rail successfully designed and patented

133
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:37,680
 a flying saucer wow that sounds awesome so um this was uh the late 1960s british rail commissioned

134
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:43,040
 an engineer who was called charles osmond frederick and they does they commissioned him to design

135
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:49,760
 a lifting platform uh for use and he took some time to develop it and then he came back to them

136
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:56,400
 he lifted things too far it's exactly in 1973 he came back with what he claimed was a fully

137
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:03,200
 functional flying fusion powered spinning flying saucer so it's uh it was a very exciting thing

138
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,640
 he handed it in and not only did they not send him away and say he was crazy but they submitted it

139
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:14,720
 to be patented and the government granted it it was successfully patented and it was given a number

140
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:21,680
 and everything and it should still in theory be patented but they overran on the on the license

141
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:27,840
 and they didn't renew um so unfortunately why on earth would you not renew a patent for a nuclear

142
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:33,680
 fusion powered flying saucer yeah can i just when when you say they wanted a lifting platform what

143
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,640
 did that mean i think you know when when you see construction workers outside and they go on that

144
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,720
 little platform that looks like a cross ladder that raises up and up i think it's like one of those

145
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,840
 they they obviously had a need for it somewhere in what they do got it and he decided a fusion

146
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:52,400
 power because it's fusion powered wasn't it which is yeah fascinatingly ambitious given that what

147
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:57,680
 humans have been trying to do for almost a century is create something that can be powered by fusion

148
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:03,440
 based energy yeah he just thought sort it i reckon i'm on to it yeah to be honest i mean it was it was

149
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:10,640
 fusion powered right it was ignited by laser beams uh and the lasers were energized by a homopolar

150
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:14,800
 generator and it kind of feels like he's just been reading a load of science fiction books and

151
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,520
 picked up a few words a gun owl you know that's a kind of thing isn't it why don't we say that i

152
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:24,640
 mean well was incredibly detailed i think he i think he thought he knew that the science didn't

153
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:29,440
 exist i think he was trying to predict the future of where science would go and the idea i think

154
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:35,200
 british rail saw this this was a time when there was a lot of interest in space and they thought maybe

155
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,760
 let's get ahead of the game here and make sure if if we suddenly discover all the things that he's

156
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,480
 predicted sorry not predicted but needs that are not yet around if they suddenly come to

157
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,360
 this this might actually work it feels a bit like patent trolling doesn't it because if i

158
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:56,000
 tomorrow managed to come up with a way of making nuclear fusion work so it can power things i don't

159
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,760
 want to have to pay 20 percent to british rail because they speculatively said that oh we invented

160
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,560
 this thing that is going to be in the future james if you do that and i am not saying you will i'm

161
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,120
 saying in fact that you won't but if you did do that you infuse like a hundred years from now

162
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,120
 sorry to cross your dreams i feel like you should believe in me okay look as a physics

163
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,120
 graduate i'm saying you are the most likely of the four of us to produce nuclear fusion however

164
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,800
 but even if you did do that in a podcast a hundred years from now they would be able to say

165
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,840
 did you know that actually we have british rail to thank for nuclear fusion it would be like

166
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:33,680
 emi and the ct scan all over again yes they're the beetles yeah or what we'd be saying it's thanks

167
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,680
 to a podcast wait a minute are we the beetles in this case i don't think we can say that i think

168
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,600
 british rail is the beetles and we're sort of einstein

169
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:48,080
 and people are going did you know it's not actually james harkin who we have to thank for fusion

170
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:54,400
 it's british rail very good yeah and one of the reasons that we didn't know this until quite recently

171
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:59,520
 so it was some like patent fans found it didn't they yeah but one of the reasons that we didn't

172
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:04,320
 find it is because it contained the word nuclear in the patent and when you put the word nuclear in

173
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,120
 your patent it kind of often gets given a secrecy order and so you need to go through an extra hoop

174
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,760
 to look at those patents really yeah it looked really cool though um if you look at the drawings

175
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,920
 on the patent it does look like a proper flying saucer and there's drawings on the inside there's

176
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:23,840
 not proper descriptions of what the inside um how it would fully function it was more trying to focus

177
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:29,120
 on the engineering side of it but it looks to some people who've who've sort of analyzed what

178
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,920
 were drawn it looks like it could carry 60 people inside it the way that it looked like they would

179
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:39,280
 be inside it is that if you picture like when you go to a fairground and there's that gravity tunnel

180
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:43,600
 thing where you all stand against the wall and as it spins you get sucked to the wall it's sort of

181
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,880
 like that the seats are the seats are arranged around the edge of the inside of the circular

182
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,120
 saucer that's an uncomfortable way to travel if you're going by british rail and you have to be

183
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,400
 stuck up against the side how are you going to get to the buffet car exactly also they don't work

184
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:03,920
 on me genuinely it doesn't work on me genuinely doesn't work on me i've been on i've been on them

185
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,160
 twice and i wouldn't go on again because everyone had to hold my hand as i slid down the wall and

186
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,960
 everyone else is stuck up there i was just i just stayed on the floor the floor drops away

187
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,800
 this is an even bigger claim than james saying he's going to invent nuclear fusion is that i'm

188
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:23,040
 saying just the laws don't apply to him just this one law isn't it like so the coolest british rail

189
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:31,120
 invention that i came across was uh did you guys know about the pub cars no i know so this is in

190
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:37,520
 1949 british rail decided to launch carriages that were pubs and they were properly decked out like

191
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:43,760
 well they went for moctuda design lovely and the outside of the carriage was all fake brick so it

192
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:50,960
 looked like an idyllic village bricked up to the pub but they put pub signs up i think uh there are

193
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:57,280
 a few of them made no they have names like the white horse the jolly tar the green man thomas the

194
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:03,520
 tanked engine would be an awesome name for one very nice very good very very good but yeah this

195
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:09,760
 happened you could go board your train and sit down have a bite insane yeah and it was it was

196
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:15,600
 discontinued because everyone thought it was really tacky oh they're wrong i went to um i went to

197
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:21,680
 universal studios in america right which is like a theme park isn't it and they have the harry potter

198
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:29,600
 world there and you can get on the um is it called the hogwarts the hogwarts express uh and you can

199
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,960
 pretend that you're going across the scottish countryside to get to hogwarts okay um but first

200
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:41,280
 of all you have to queue up in an exact replica of king's cross and then um they have a shop which

201
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:47,520
 is supposed to be exactly the same as a uk railway shop and they're so accurate they sold cans of

202
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:55,280
 strongbow isn't that amazing they sold they had loads of like british brands of like i don't know

203
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,320
 what british brands are but like candies and stuff like that round trees but they had cans of strongbow

204
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:06,720
 i've never felt so at home in my life drunk eight-year-olds everywhere yeah running desperately

205
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:13,680
 at platform nine and three quarters so many concussed children since you mentioned harry potter

206
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,040
 i just want to say something about king's cross station because you know platform nine and three

207
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:21,120
 quarters the thing that really pisses off harry potter fans about it when you go to king's cross

208
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:26,720
 no where is it it's between platforms eight and nine so basically jk rowling guy station's confused

209
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,480
 she meant houston she said king's cross and so they couldn't actually put platform nine and

210
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,560
 three quarters between platforms nine and ten so it's between eight and nine and a harry potter

211
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:38,800
 fan goes to king's cross is like oh my god this doesn't make any sense it's not eight and three

212
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:47,360
 quarters wow king's cross could resolve this quite pressing problem because they have 13 platforms

213
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:52,320
 they've got but they've got they've got 13 platforms but their platforms only go up to 11 so one of

214
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,880
 them is nine and three quarters which is like a fake one but the other one they needed to add an

215
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,520
 extra platform a few years ago and they needed to add it to the left hand side to the opposite side

216
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,440
 of platform one and they didn't want to call it platform 12 because they thought that'll confuse

217
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,640
 people because it's at the opposite end to like platform 10 11 etc so they called it platform zero

218
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:16,400
 right so what king's cross can do is they rename platform zero platform one yeah as you would rename

219
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:22,000
 platform one platform two etc etc etc you get to platform eight and nine and suddenly platform

220
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,440
 nine and three quarters is in the right place it's a great idea i mean you only have one week

221
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:32,400
 probably of people wanting to go to lutan and ended up in glasgow but then once that's happened

222
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,880
 a few times people will get wise to it to be honest what's one week more of lost economic

223
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:44,960
 activity for the uk at this point exactly should we talk about ufo's let's do it they're illegal

224
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:51,040
 in chateau nerf de pape you are right will they disturb the grapes don't they that is actually

225
00:20:51,040 --> 00:21:00,400
 exactly why it is a really really well kind of yeah so chateau nerf de pape it's a town in southeast

226
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:06,800
 france and they obviously make very good red wine and all the winemakers are quite protective of

227
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:13,120
 their brand and then in the 1950s there was a load of reports in france of these what they called

228
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:19,600
 cigar valance which means flying cigars and there were these kind of ufo's going around and people

229
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,160
 saying that they'd seen martians and stuff like that it's just like one of these normal mass hysteria

230
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:28,800
 things where everyone thought they saw ufo's but when that happened all the wine growers were

231
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:35,440
 like well we can't have ufo's around here so they made a law saying that no ufo is allowed to land

232
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,560
 in chateau nerf de pape and they're not even allowed to fly over and if any alien lands then

233
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:46,160
 they will be arrested immediately and actually only a few years ago the mayor of chateau nerf de

234
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:50,880
 pape said that they will keep the law on the books so it definitely does exist he said that they

235
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,400
 want to keep it because it kind of gives them a little bit of publicity and stuff and it gets them

236
00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:00,400
 in the news every now and again when people realize this is the thing but yes if you're an alien then

237
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,880
 you like your wine you can't go to chateau nerf de pape do you think do you think there are aliens

238
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,560
 in alien air traffic control somewhere going oh we've really need to land in the sort of south

239
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:14,240
 of france region oh but we you remember we can't do it in the pape area because of course

240
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,440
 into planetary law i don't know how much they respect into planetary law i think it's a french

241
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,080
 law isn't it question is have you ever heard of a ufo landing there Anna that is a good question

242
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:31,520
 and i haven't done point proven point proven they respect it greatly um do you guys know that a

243
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:38,880
 decline in christianity is directly responsible for a massive rise in flying sources in an interesting

244
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:48,720
 way um so this is because in the 1940s there's a there was a belgian company called belgica

245
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:54,240
 and it made communion wafers for church and a decline in christianity meant that there was

246
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,160
 suddenly a lot less demand for communion wafers and so they were like well what do we do we've

247
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:02,880
 got this technology but people aren't really buying it anymore and then what they realized was

248
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:09,760
 they could take that paper in communion wafers sandwich some sherbet in between two bits of it

249
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:16,400
 and what you've got there is a flying saucer no the confectionery left by all so hitting so flying

250
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:22,480
 saucers are made from communion wafers same stuff i guess originate yeah yeah that is amazing and i've

251
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:30,640
 got to say the church is really missing out on a way of getting the youth in isn't it yeah if those

252
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:36,000
 wafers exploded in your mouth in the same way that flying sources do i might convert that is cool

253
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:48,560
 okay it is time for fact number three and that is andy my fact is that in 2017 the u.s defense

254
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:54,080
 secretary had a light installed in his bathroom which would turn on if north korea launched a

255
00:23:54,080 --> 00:24:03,520
 nuclear missile how stressful wow how stressful who was it that was james when james mattis that's

256
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:09,360
 right jim mattis and this was at the time when north korea was launching it was the big sort of

257
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:16,400
 north korean missile huha of 2017 and it needed urgent response obviously if they launched another

258
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,520
 missile although detected doing another nuclear test and this light was installed in his bathroom

259
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,920
 so he could see it from the shower if he was having a shower he would be able to immediately

260
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:30,800
 jump out of the shower go downstairs get in the car and go and did he always have to shower in

261
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:37,120
 the dark so that he'd be able to see this light really well i don't know what he had basically

262
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,440
 his whole home was rigged up like this huge korean missile booby trap so there was a bell in his

263
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:47,440
 kitchen that was one in his bedroom and i should say this is all from a new book called rage by

264
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:54,880
 bob woodward who is an incredible veteran u.s reporter and these these bells went off on more

265
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:01,760
 than one occasion and he had a car which had to be followed by an suv and inside the suv there was

266
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,960
 a team plotting the flight path of any potential incoming nuclear missile and this was just his

267
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,280
 life he had a very very stressful life and he slept he slept in his gym clothes didn't he he

268
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:15,360
 had just had to be at the ready yeah time i don't think he should have showered in his clothes as

269
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:23,200
 well otherwise we'll see how often did he end up naked in the emergency vehicles just on on missiles

270
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:29,440
 generally it's astonishing when you look into the history of missile and missile alerts in

271
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:35,680
 the last 70 years and you realize how many times we've come to the brink of essentially nuclear war

272
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:39,760
 based on a what should have been a minor cock up isn't it so there have just been so many

273
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:47,520
 false missile alarms and i think my favorite ones are well one of them was in 1960 when there was

274
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,800
 so mid-cold war everyone is very tense to be fair there was radar u.s radar in greenland

275
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:57,680
 which suddenly reported that there were dozens of soviet missiles coming over the horizon exactly

276
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:02,560
 where they'd be expected to be coming from and they were attacking and so the u.s defense command

277
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:09,040
 went into maximum alert um you know things were they were getting ready to retaliate and it turned

278
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:16,880
 out to be the moon so it was all right it was a moon rise over norway which it happened that the

279
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:23,040
 moon reflected back the radar uh in the same way the missile attack might have wow and it came back

280
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:29,840
 with 99.9 percent certainty that they were under soviet attack and that's amazing that's poor

281
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,160
 programming isn't it it's because you would think that the moon sometimes rises over norway

282
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:38,560
 and you'd think there would be some kind of anti-moon protocol built into this program yeah

283
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:44,640
 there was another one in 1979 where they believed that they were on the brink of of death as well

284
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:50,720
 and it was um this one guy who was the national security advisor to president corridor so this

285
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,920
 is in america where this happened um he woke up with the phone call saying that the soviets had

286
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:02,560
 just launched 250 missiles and it was headed straight for them and he had this weird reaction

287
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:06,720
 where he was in a house full of his family and he didn't bother to wake his wife up because he

288
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,360
 assumed that there was no point in troubling her with the fear they were all going to be dead

289
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:16,960
 in the next half hour or so so just leave them and um he sort of casually just accepted that death

290
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:22,880
 was coming and then just waited in all the systems again sort of showed that this was a big mistake

291
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:28,160
 and they couldn't work out what it was turns out it was a video game that had been put accidentally

292
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:34,240
 into the system at norad and they were doing a simulation of what it would be like if they were

293
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,560
 attacked but the system thought it was real and it was just a complete cock up yeah so this war

294
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:42,320
 game was playing out and they all thought this was a real thing and they eventually worked that out

295
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:47,920
 and carter never found out until years or at least months down the line that this had in fact happened

296
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:53,840
 I can't imagine not waking up one spouse at a time when you think nuclear war is coming

297
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,960
 well that's just your typical selfish attitude isn't it you're suffering you want her to suffer too

298
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:06,640
 you want to be screaming with someone I guess he had a job to do though right like he had

299
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,560
 he was the guy who was meant to check in on this you wouldn't want your whole family screaming

300
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:16,560
 around you go as you try to remain calm one of the really scary things is that one of the things

301
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:22,080
 he thought to do in that moment was and this was supposedly the quote I want to make sure that we'd

302
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:27,040
 have company and the idea was he wanted to press a button of retaliation on the Soviets

303
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:32,880
 before they all died so that that was wiped out as well so like like this misfire thing that could

304
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:38,400
 have led to something real as well well that's why there's a lot of controversy still about the

305
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:43,280
 fact that we still have all those cold war things in place which mean that they can retaliate within

306
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:48,400
 minutes and but I think the terrifying thing about that one Dan was that it must have seemed so

307
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:54,400
 perfect right because the the tape I think it was a technician accidentally put this tape into one of

308
00:28:54,400 --> 00:29:02,400
 the machines at NORAD which is the North American Aerospace Defense Command and it the whole point

309
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,400
 of the simulation was to make it seem like the Soviets had launched the worst possible attack

310
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:10,320
 you know every single nuclear facility was targeted every single missile was targeted

311
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:16,400
 so it must have been like wow they've really got us this time yeah yeah they do have um it's not

312
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:22,560
 just one person presses the button and then the missile goes they have a few safeguards so at any

313
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:28,160
 time in America they have 90 what are called missile ears who are sitting on alert somewhere in the

314
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:35,200
 desert wow they're all underground kind of in these silo places and they work in teams of two

315
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:42,400
 and they each sit together in like on the wall it says a no-lone zone as in you're not allowed to

316
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:47,120
 be alone because if you're on your own you might accidentally start World War 3 without you know

317
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:51,920
 someone telling you not to yeah and you sit two of you in a room and there's an A side and a B

318
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:57,840
 side and you each have a code which you're supposed to put in and if your codes match then that sets

319
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:03,760
 off the bomb but also I think five of the people in the whole thing need to do it at the same time

320
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:10,560
 in order for them to go off and there's 90 of them and in the US military it's mostly men who are

321
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:16,560
 obviously in the in the military um but in that particular one there's a disproportionately high

322
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:22,800
 number of women in that role and the US Air Force um did a big sort of press release in March 2016

323
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:28,560
 because they had the first time that it was an all-female alert so all 90 people who were like in

324
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:32,800
 charge of whether America sends missiles to its enemies were women and that was the first time

325
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:38,160
 that happened all 90 yeah wow so they have an all together they have a team of quite a few hundred

326
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:43,200
 and so normally it would be a mix but on this particular occasion they had the first ever

327
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:49,040
 all-female team obviously you wouldn't want nuclear war to happen ever yeah it does happen then it

328
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:56,720
 would be a nice win for equality if it was the last if it was yeah if I don't know but would it

329
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:03,360
 that I mean some naysayers would say that if the one time when we actually started a nuclear war

330
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,600
 was the first time it was all women working up that's a very good point it would I think it would

331
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:12,960
 set back the cause of women working in missile silos across the world well fortunately there

332
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,920
 would be no humans around to uh have that problem if there would be some man there was some man would

333
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:25,840
 pop up saying ah if you remember we did try this yes some male cockroach there's that really sweet

334
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:30,800
 story which I think is quite famous I didn't actually know it so I feel like I should mention it

335
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:37,760
 but before norad was called norad it was called konad and konad was the continental air defense

336
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:44,720
 command and one day the air force colonel harry shoup sitting in his office and he gets a phone

337
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,360
 call which is on a line which basically suggests that the russians are attacking if this phone

338
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:54,320
 rings the russians are attacking and at the end of the line which he grabs it up nervously expecting

339
00:31:54,320 --> 00:32:00,640
 the worse he hears a tiny little voice which says is this santa claus and he thinks what what the

340
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:05,840
 hell's going on here and he barks into the phone back at them say we know what's going on and the

341
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:10,640
 voice is crying he's going is this one of santa's elves and what had happened was there was a huge

342
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:17,120
 mistake there was an advert that was placed in sears catalogue the sears advert which gave out the

343
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:22,080
 number to call santa claus but they put the wrong number in there and the number they ended up giving

344
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:30,880
 was this classified line that was dedicated to a russian missile attack and it's so funny it's

345
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:36,400
 extraordinary that that happens what were the chances it's not just a random person in america

346
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:43,200
 yeah and um what's wonderful about it though is that they decided to embrace it and that is a thing

347
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:49,120
 now that you can call norad and ask them to track where santa is oh in the period of crisis so you

348
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,240
 are going to say you can ask them to drop a bomb any way you like for christmas that's what you want

349
00:32:54,240 --> 00:33:00,080
 have you been good yes the naughty list consists of vladimir vladimirovich putin

350
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:11,920
 okay and it's time for our final fact of the show and that is james my fact this week is that fashion

351
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:18,080
 historian hillary davidson has invented the bill and ted test which judges the historical accuracy

352
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:23,680
 of movie costumes by comparing them against the surprisingly accurate movie bill and ted's

353
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:29,360
 excellent adventure so i did wonder why everyone in pride and prejudice is wearing backwards caps

354
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:38,080
 well this is really interesting because um this historian um hillary davidson she was actually

355
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:44,720
 writing a book about dress in the age of jane austin uh and when she was writing it there's a lot of

356
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,040
 quite boring bits that you have to do of copy editing and indexing and stuff like that and

357
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:54,000
 when she was doing her copy editing of the index as it happens um she was watching movies at the

358
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,120
 same time because it was just such a boring tedious job uh and so she was watching bill and ted and

359
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:05,440
 she got to the bit where they kidnapped baithoven and they she kind of looked at the extras and thought

360
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:10,960
 wow they are actually really good they look just like they're supposed to look and so she thought

361
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,600
 well that's it i'm a fashion historian i need a benchmark i need to decide what's good and what's

362
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:20,560
 bad so this is my benchmark if you're making a proper regency production and you can't get

363
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:26,320
 it as good as bill and ted then there's something wrong and so now on twitter she has @ bill and ted

364
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:31,760
 test um where whenever she sees a new movie she rates it against bill and ted and sees whether it

365
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:37,760
 passes or fails are there films which uh you know have failed the bill and ted test oh i didn't write

366
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:45,520
 them down um i'm sorry i can't remember star wars star wars big fail but basically she she says there's

367
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,680
 a few things you need to look forward the fab ring for instance so if they're wearing something that's

368
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:54,960
 obviously polyester or something like that um then it just looks wrong and you can tell it but the

369
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:03,200
 other thing is the hair so if your hair is um down and you're an adult woman then unless you are

370
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:08,720
 unmarried and a virgin or you're a prostitute or you're mad then you would not have your hair down

371
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:14,720
 for a woman in that kind of period that's a big risk in a singles bar isn't it i mean i think she's

372
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:22,720
 unmarried and a virgin but it's possible she's a mad prostitute yeah and she wants to she does

373
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:28,240
 say in um this interview in slate she she's stressing that she's not saying everyone has to be completely

374
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:33,520
 historically accurate for everything um but sometimes it can if you're an expert it can put

375
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:38,480
 you off a little bit by seeing you know someone wearing a like you say a baseball cap in the

376
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:43,200
 middle of pride and prejudice yeah it might be worth saying for the one person who is not totally

377
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,280
 familiar with bill and ted that the reason that it's a good benchmark is because they travel

378
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,320
 in time right to lots of different yes um yeah lots of different time periods where they're wearing

379
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,840
 the clothes of that period is that right i mean they're not wearing the clothes of that period

380
00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:00,240
 they stay in their own mufti throughout but they go and visit people like Beethoven and Socrates

381
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:05,600
 and Napoleon and yeah they must really stand out yeah they do that's kind of where some of the comedy

382
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:11,120
 comes in yeah i mean it is one of the greatest movies ever made in my opinion and it's one of

383
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:16,080
 the probably half a dozen films before 2010 that i've actually seen i think that might be why you

384
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:19,680
 think it's one of the greatest movies ever made if you compare them with the overall number of movies

385
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:24,640
 made um it's so good but they do spend a portion of the movie in the future is that why you've allowed

386
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:31,920
 that to be part of the movies you can watch james yes exactly i love that we have to thank for giving

387
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:39,520
 us bill and ted the thriller post-apocalyptic author richard matheson uh so if you don't know

388
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:45,600
 richard matheson he is the author of i am legend he is an author who steven king said is the greatest

389
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:51,760
 influence uh that steven king has had by another author that is richard matheson he's he's the master

390
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,880
 and sorry and if you don't know what i am legend is it's basically 2020 in a book

391
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:04,640
 it's basically a worldwide apocalypse due to disease isn't it yeah exactly it's exactly that

392
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:10,160
 and so richard matheson happens to be the father of chris matheson who is the co-writer and co-creator

393
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:15,280
 along with um his partner solomon of bill and ted and bill and ted was meant to be just a throw

394
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:19,920
 away sketch they had this idea they were going to play the characters live on stage and they

395
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,240
 happened to just mention it to richard matheson saying this is the idea that we have for this

396
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,880
 sketch and he said i actually think there's a whole movie in this and they thought oh god okay

397
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,480
 that's interesting never thought to do that and they wrote up the movie and that's why we have the

398
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:38,160
 most excellent in bogus adventures wasn't it wasn't it almost the most excellent bogus adventures

399
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:43,200
 um or the most excellent adventures of bill ted and bob because initially in their improv group

400
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:48,480
 and the hot it was like constant improvise wasn't it and uh there were three of them but the character

401
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:53,040
 who was playing bob sort of lost interest in the whole concept and disappeared and so ended up just

402
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:57,680
 being the two of them but it's also they were committed to the bill and ted conceit for years

403
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:03,040
 before it materialized into a film they sort of used to like always like keep the improv going

404
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,480
 they would write letters to each other in the characters of bill and ted i don't know if that's

405
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:13,600
 a standard improv behaviour andy it's not okay i'm not constantly writing regency themed letters

406
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:18,640
 to my buddies in the group it's a shame a lot of the things with bill and ted how it's come into

407
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:24,080
 the culture is obviously through its language right so um anna if you haven't seen it they

408
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:30,720
 speak in this real kind of surferish slang of saying like bodacious and triumphant and stuff

409
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:35,200
 like that um and i looked in the oxford english dictionary and they're referenced about a dozen

410
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:41,760
 times uh in the oxford english dictionary so they're referenced for um the phrase yes way

411
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:47,600
 as in the opposite of no way oh wow yes way uh they're referenced in dude in the entry for dude

412
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:53,040
 and also in the entry for second base and they're not first citations they're just kind of examples

413
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:59,600
 but they are the first citation of party on so we don't know anyone else who said party on

414
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:04,640
 before bill and ted did and they're the first citation outside of dictionaries of the word

415
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:10,880
 dickweed um so it's it was mentioned outside dictionaries did you say yeah so sometimes

416
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:16,000
 did a lexicographer invent the word dickweed sneak it in hope it would take off and then

417
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:22,720
 sometimes the oed takes like words from slang dictionaries and puts it into the oed but they

418
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:27,200
 didn't have the citation from there but they do have the citation from bill and ted which is

419
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:34,880
 the first one where um bill says you killed ted you medieval dickweed and that's the first example

420
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:40,000
 we have of someone using that in real life so bill and ted is back in the cinemas uh right now

421
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,560
 as we speak face the music the third and i thought they'd been this ginormous gap between the last

422
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:48,640
 movie and now that's all the bill and ted that we have but it turns out underneath there's been

423
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:54,480
 so much there was an animated series which had kianu and alex winter and george carlin voicing

424
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:59,120
 it can i just say that was one of the best cartoons i used to love as a kid i used to love

425
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:02,640
 that so much that show didn't know it existed that's the only version of bill and ted that i've

426
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:07,280
 seen is occasionally what really yeah it had an amazing theme tune as well you're gonna find the

427
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:12,000
 theme tune did you see the live series then there was an action series live action series and they

428
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 cast people who when you look at the pictures look exactly like the guys but they also went into

429
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,160
 theater there was bill and ted's excellent halloween adventure and musical adventure there were

430
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:26,000
 board games there was the excellent board game and riff in time r i f f riff in time um and then

431
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,680
 there was a whole comic book series that has been run for years which were written and drawn by a

432
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:36,720
 guy called evan dorkin really yeah and i basically just said all of that so that i can say the word

433
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:41,840
 evan dorkin i was thinking these are standard brand extensions i don't know where dan's going

434
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:48,160
 with this it's always heading to the name dorkin i did find one fact about the comic book which is

435
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:52,800
 that because they use a time traveling phone booth which people might think is a bit a bit of a rip

436
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:59,120
 off from dr who they use the comic book to explain that actually um due to the way time travel works

437
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:04,880
 dr who ripped off bill and ted despite having started in 1960 something that's a brilliant way

438
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:10,320
 to get around the patents problem we had earlier i live the episode absolutely yeah but dr who is

439
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:14,400
 also a time traveler and i would say a more adept time traveler than bill and ted though i haven't

440
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,800
 seen it but he is very good at it so i would imagine he can always have claimed to have gone

441
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,360
 back he's been to the beginning of the universe yes you know one place that dr who's never been

442
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:29,280
 because he's an alien shat on earth the pap yes i want to see the episode of dr who where he lands

443
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:37,920
 in shat on earth the pap and gets immediately arrested i wrote a such an endearing interview

444
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:42,240
 with um kyana reeves which actually just came out recently but was an interview that he did

445
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:46,560
 in 1987 which is when they were making bill and ted but i think no one knew who he was then

446
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:51,680
 and then the film got delayed so the interview was never released at the time and uh it was for

447
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:57,360
 the rap and he admitted that he wasn't a good actor in fact in it he said uh so i think the

448
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:03,280
 interviewer who was steve steve pond asked him how long have you been acting and kyana reeves said

449
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:09,680
 i don't really know if i'm acting now i'm pretty bad i mean i hate acting most of the time i do

450
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:16,240
 it it's a god awful job just on old awesome movies um this isn't to do with bill and ted um

451
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:22,080
 but our friend are you just using the word awesome as a connectively kind of is but you'll

452
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:27,680
 see where i'm going because they kind of in the same um in the same genre ish so um our friend

453
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:32,240
 justin gayner sent me an article which i'd missed from the guardian which a few people will have seen

454
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:36,560
 about cool runnings then you obviously see this article it's absolutely brilliant it was an interview

455
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:43,280
 with a few people including john turtletown who was the director and he gave some bits of trivia

456
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:48,720
 about cool runnings which are amazing so it was translated around the world and in norway it was

457
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:56,000
 translated as cold buttocks cool runnings and he said that after cool runnings he got sent

458
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:02,240
 lots of similar kind of screenplays about sports uh and they were all kind of almost identical

459
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:07,040
 and he said it got so bad that at one point i received a script called amanda without reading

460
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:11,120
 a word i picked up the phone and said to my agent what kind of animal is it and what's wrong with

461
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:23,360
 the kid there was a long pause before the reply came it's a horse and a brain tube okay that's it
