00:00:14,00:00:20,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:00:20,00:00:26,"from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with James"
00:00:26,00:00:31,"Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and Anna Tushinsky and once again we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:31,00:00:37,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go. Starting
00:00:37,00:00:43,"with you, Anna. My fact this week is that during out-of-hours periods hospital CT scanners are"
00:00:43,00:00:53,"sometimes used to scan Egyptian mummies. Wow, so cool. It's so weird this is um because mummies"
00:00:53,00:00:58,need scanning sometimes to find out what's inside them so it's much less invasive as you can imagine
00:00:58,00:01:04,than actually unwrapping a mummy which can sort of cause the mummies to disintegrate as you do it
00:01:04,00:01:09,and you want to know what jewels they've got in them or what state their bones are in stuff like that
00:01:09,00:01:15,and about well actually almost since the dawn of x-rays they realized this would be really useful
00:01:15,00:01:20,for scanning mummies and since the year 2000 apparently it's been a routine use for hospital
00:01:20,00:01:25,CT scanners is to use them on mummies there are various hospitals in the UK that do it I think
00:01:25,00:01:30,Manchester Children's Hospital does a very strong line in loaning its CT scanners out.
00:01:30,00:01:34,I remember I think it was Leeds Hospital I can't remember exactly but I read one of them saying
00:01:34,00:01:39,that they did it in the night or out of hours because they didn't want to scare the patients
00:01:39,00:01:44,which I think makes sense doesn't it? I love the idea of seeing the previous patient coming out
00:01:44,00:01:47,and then being desiccated and they're 2000 years old I'm not going in there.
00:01:47,00:01:55,I think it looks a bit late for that one to be honest so the scounds necessary.
00:01:55,00:02:00,So this one was in Spain right the specific story that you sent around to us because I found this
00:02:00,00:02:05,very specific one very fascinating the fact that this was a project that was done between
00:02:05,00:02:10,the Spanish National Museum of Archaeology and one of the university hospitals and they wanted to
00:02:10,00:02:15,scan three of the mummies that they had trying to identify who they were and really cool thing about
00:02:15,00:02:21,it is that they had to map out a specific route from the museum to the hospital so that they
00:02:21,00:02:26,went on roads that had no bumps on them so that they didn't damage the mum you know you don't want
00:02:26,00:02:31,to hit a speed bump break your mummy in half on the way. That's pretty sweet I once broke a rib
00:02:31,00:02:36,and I got a taxi home because I didn't realize I broke my rib and it's the most pain that I've ever
00:02:36,00:02:40,been in because the speed bumps everywhere in London isn't there yeah and tax drivers don't seem
00:02:40,00:02:45,to care about them and it was just every time you went over one it killed and then I read a bit later
00:02:45,00:02:51,that they thought they might use speed bumps as a way of telling if you've got appendicitis
00:02:51,00:02:57,so it's a really good way of telling because the speed bumps hurt you so much if you've got
00:02:57,00:03:02,something like appendicitis that it's almost as good a way of diagnosing it as almost any other
00:03:02,00:03:07,non-invasive way. Wow I think these are great though we should release these as part of GPS
00:03:07,00:03:13,sort of like Egyptologists should release the routes that have no bumps so that like not just
00:03:13,00:03:18,people with broken ribs but mummies to be you know pregnant women they can't go over bumps as well
00:03:18,00:03:22,you know we should be using this for a footage well no I mean it's not good for you it's not good
00:03:22,00:03:27,for you to go but it's so funny because you've got a bump and yet you can't go over a bump the bump
00:03:27,00:03:32,is within you already that is funny you should only have one one bump should never meet another
00:03:32,00:03:38,that's the rule the Spanish ones are really cool because they there were some Egyptian mummies and
00:03:38,00:03:43,there were some guanchi mummies which are ancient people from Tenerife and I didn't know that people
00:03:43,00:03:48,from Tenerife got turned into mummies they were buried in caves and the naturally dry air desiccated
00:03:48,00:03:53,them and dried them out so yeah and the Egyptian one they got when they scanned they discovered
00:03:53,00:03:59,that it was the Pharaoh Imhotep's high priest like what a score what a that's like to me that's like
00:03:59,00:04:05,panini stickers like you're like oh yes it's like a shiny priest yeah exactly it's a shiny
00:04:05,00:04:11,how did they tell that from a scan was he wearing a badge he was actually like weirdly he was wearing
00:04:11,00:04:16,a lot of amulets and there were lots of adornments where they could piece together who he was uh
00:04:16,00:04:22,from what he was wearing okay make sense because yeah they're often wrapped up with you know
00:04:22,00:04:26,possessions like rubies and jewels and sapphires and things like that aren't they so the scan
00:04:26,00:04:30,actually serves two purposes with the mummy you can see what they were buried with and so learn
00:04:30,00:04:34,a lot about the rituals and then you can see into their bones and see kind of what injuries they had
00:04:34,00:04:40,and so what sort of lives they led and also quite often you can see what it actually is so it turns
00:04:40,00:04:45,out when things are mummified and we find them we don't always know even whether it's a human or an
00:04:45,00:04:50,animal they brought one into the Kent Institute of Medicine and Surgery in 2018 which they all
00:04:50,00:04:55,thought was a mummified bird and put it through the scanner and it turned out that it was a miscarried
00:04:55,00:05:01,baby but that actually makes it the youngest mummy ever to be discovered that's amazing so it
00:05:01,00:05:06,tells you a lot have you heard about the crocodile shaped mummy that they found no no this was brought
00:05:06,00:05:11,in and it was i mean it was very clearly the shape of a crocodile it couldn't it was if it was a
00:05:11,00:05:17,Christmas present under the tree you would think oh i'm getting a crocodile basically but they looked
00:05:17,00:05:21,into it they scanned it right in the CT scanner and they discovered that it was not a crocodile
00:05:21,00:05:29,can you guess what it was oh an alligator no um a human sticking their arms out in a crocodile
00:05:29,00:05:35,mouth fashion oh yeah like an old school baby baby shark kind of like a baby shark impersonation
00:05:35,00:05:42,yes yeah it was actually eight crocodiles it was eight small crocodiles which had been mummified
00:05:42,00:05:46,in the shape of a big crocodile and i think this is where we get the cultural trope of the like
00:05:46,00:05:51,three small people in an overcoat yeah exactly but they're trying to get into an adult crocodile
00:05:51,00:05:58,movie crocodiles were hunted to be mummified as well weren't they which we didn't realize we
00:05:58,00:06:02,kind of thought that they just mummified dead crocodiles as and when they came upon them
00:06:02,00:06:08,but they've realized from CT scanning the mummified crocs they've realized that you
00:06:08,00:06:13,you must have had sort of crocodile hunters who would have to go out and beat crocodiles to death
00:06:13,00:06:19,and they smashed it the CT scan shows that their skulls have been smashed in and then rebuilt
00:06:19,00:06:22,so you kill it by smashing in its skull but then you kind of need to make it look like a proper
00:06:22,00:06:27,skull again it's not surprising they went for eight baby crocodiles they just came back saying oh
00:06:27,00:06:32,yeah i got another crocodile here i've actually pre-mummified it so there's no need to examine
00:06:34,00:06:42,very good um so CT scanners the the object themselves um a british invention at least
00:06:42,00:06:50,half so from a guy called godfrey and houndsfield who in the 70s was awarded a Nobel prize for it
00:06:50,00:06:57,and EMI were the people who developed the CT scanner and EMI is the very same EMI that is the
00:06:57,00:07:03,music company and when they yeah when they were developing this they needed more money to sort
00:07:03,00:07:09,of help the company to do this stuff and it just so happened that in 1957 EMI acquired capital
00:07:09,00:07:16,records which allowed them to distribute british music into america and it's 1957 the beetles
00:07:16,00:07:22,are about to arrive in 1962 a few years later and that is that helped raise the money for CT
00:07:22,00:07:27,scanners so the beetles are partially responsible for the reason that we have CT scanners i've read
00:07:27,00:07:33,quite a few places saying that's a myth and there's a paper which is called do we really need to thank
00:07:33,00:07:40,the beetles for financing the development of the computed tomography scanner i don't know if that's
00:07:40,00:07:48,the kind of tone that they had in mind when they wrote the title but they say um that EMI only paid
00:07:48,00:07:54,about 100 000 pounds into the into the development of the CT scanner whereas the government paid
00:07:54,00:07:59,in a lot more than that and so they say accordingly british taxpayers and officials of the british
00:07:59,00:08:05,dhss are to be thanked for the CT scanner the beetles input into the world's culture is valuable
00:08:05,00:08:10,but it does not require decoration by non-existent connection to the development of CT
00:08:10,00:08:16,i don't know hear me out hear me out hear me out who was paying a lot of tax due to very very
00:08:16,00:08:22,high government tax rates in the 1960s and 70s the beetles right the rod of stone's all they went
00:08:22,00:08:28,to france it was the beetles i've got to say i do i do agree with them that i think these guys are
00:08:28,00:08:32,being a little bit uppity in it and i think that the beetles you know it's 100 000 pounds and it
00:08:32,00:08:36,was at the start as well they gave houndsfield the money at the top and then the government came
00:08:36,00:08:40,in and gave them a lot more money later so i think it's kind of fair that the beetles had something
00:08:40,00:08:47,to say but sorry what it was a record label investing in CT scanners well because EMI stands for
00:08:47,00:08:52,electric and music industries and they originally an electrical and music company so they made
00:08:52,00:08:58,electrics and they made music and so this was like the electrical side of their brand and they
00:08:58,00:09:04,also did music stuff as well okay sounds legit yeah it sounds almost it's still loose i reckon but
00:09:04,00:09:11,yeah good on them thank you beetles for saving so many lives rockets get CT scanned and that's to
00:09:11,00:09:17,check that all their stuff is working so nasa and the navy use this system called actist systems
00:09:17,00:09:23,which are special rocket CT scanners and they are specially rigged up to spot floors in like the
00:09:23,00:09:30,engine parts and stuff like that and they doubled up as whale scanners very cool this guy called
00:09:30,00:09:34,ted cranford who's a whale expert and he became obsessed with the idea that he really wanted
00:09:34,00:09:40,to CT scan a whale and most whales don't fit into most conventional CT scanners and you could get
00:09:40,00:09:48,six tiny whales and put them in a big whale suit doesn't make any sense you've got to go the other
00:09:48,00:09:54,way round chop a whale into six parts uh anyway so first of all he needed to get hold of a whale
00:09:54,00:09:58,so apparently his mates knew that he was looking for a big old whale head to scan and they found
00:09:58,00:10:04,a dead sperm whale on a california beach and so these two friends of his borrowed a front end
00:10:04,00:10:09,loader like one of those trucks from a construction company nearby cut the head off this whale carried
00:10:09,00:10:14,it to a massive freezer somewhere in a marine laboratory in california called ted was like
00:10:14,00:10:19,well look we've got your whale head what now and then ted was like okay cool we need to find a
00:10:19,00:10:25,CT scanner and he convinced the navy to loan him their massive rocket scanner and it's revealed
00:10:25,00:10:31,lots of cool stuff so the whole point is to find out about whale vocalization so sperm whale clicks
00:10:31,00:10:36,are incredibly loud so he wants to look at how they make them and then how they hear and yeah
00:10:36,00:10:41,now he just shoves marine animals through CT scanners all the time he said the um i was really
00:10:41,00:10:47,an interview with him and he was saying he once was trying to dissect a dolphin head and he had to
00:10:47,00:10:52,do it in a deep freezer so he has to wear freezer gear and go into the deep freezer to dissect this
00:10:52,00:10:58,head uh but at the time the deep freeze was being shared by a giant skewer uh sort of swan-sized bird
00:10:58,00:11:04,from antarctica oh skewer i thought yeah we're having a giant kebab at the end of the day
00:11:04,00:11:09,no a skewer this this massive bird from the antarctic they just kept attacking him and
00:11:09,00:11:15,vomiting on him for four days as he tried to dissect this oh it was alive why was it live
00:11:15,00:11:20,in the freezer well it's from antarctic it's used to life exactly it wouldn't like it in the oven
00:11:20,00:11:28,but what it was okay the dolphin's dead i thought the dolphin was alive the dolphin no dolphin's
00:11:28,00:11:33,dead and it's not in water it's not in the wrong way around dolphin's dead in the freezer if you
00:11:33,00:11:38,put a dolphin in the freezer it will die if it's not already uh skewer's life yeah but yeah he's
00:11:38,00:11:43,a bit of a hero was the skewer kind of tied up do you think it must have been right that kind of
00:11:43,00:11:49,just been what kind of sick messed up scientist ties up a skewer in a freezer i was thinking you
00:11:49,00:11:53,know what i was thinking and yeah what i was thinking is and this won't go in but do you remember
00:11:53,00:11:58,on your stag do when we did the escape room with the zombie who was tied up oh yeah i was just
00:11:58,00:12:04,thinking that as well yes with the chain and he only gets so far i can imagine even more exciting
00:12:04,00:12:11,if it was a skewer yeah yeah and then if the key is hidden inside the head of a dead dolphin but
00:12:11,00:12:22,you have to get it into a c2 scanner to see where it is okay it's time for fact number two and that
00:12:22,00:12:29,is my fact my fact this week is that in 1973 british rail successfully designed and patented
00:12:29,00:12:37,a flying saucer wow that sounds awesome so um this was uh the late 1960s british rail commissioned
00:12:37,00:12:43,an engineer who was called charles osmond frederick and they does they commissioned him to design
00:12:43,00:12:49,a lifting platform uh for use and he took some time to develop it and then he came back to them
00:12:49,00:12:56,he lifted things too far it's exactly in 1973 he came back with what he claimed was a fully
00:12:56,00:13:03,functional flying fusion powered spinning flying saucer so it's uh it was a very exciting thing
00:13:03,00:13:08,he handed it in and not only did they not send him away and say he was crazy but they submitted it
00:13:08,00:13:14,to be patented and the government granted it it was successfully patented and it was given a number
00:13:14,00:13:21,and everything and it should still in theory be patented but they overran on the on the license
00:13:21,00:13:27,and they didn't renew um so unfortunately why on earth would you not renew a patent for a nuclear
00:13:27,00:13:33,fusion powered flying saucer yeah can i just when when you say they wanted a lifting platform what
00:13:33,00:13:38,did that mean i think you know when when you see construction workers outside and they go on that
00:13:38,00:13:42,little platform that looks like a cross ladder that raises up and up i think it's like one of those
00:13:42,00:13:47,they they obviously had a need for it somewhere in what they do got it and he decided a fusion
00:13:47,00:13:52,power because it's fusion powered wasn't it which is yeah fascinatingly ambitious given that what
00:13:52,00:13:57,humans have been trying to do for almost a century is create something that can be powered by fusion
00:13:57,00:14:03,based energy yeah he just thought sort it i reckon i'm on to it yeah to be honest i mean it was it was
00:14:03,00:14:10,fusion powered right it was ignited by laser beams uh and the lasers were energized by a homopolar
00:14:10,00:14:14,generator and it kind of feels like he's just been reading a load of science fiction books and
00:14:14,00:14:19,picked up a few words a gun owl you know that's a kind of thing isn't it why don't we say that i
00:14:19,00:14:24,mean well was incredibly detailed i think he i think he thought he knew that the science didn't
00:14:24,00:14:29,exist i think he was trying to predict the future of where science would go and the idea i think
00:14:29,00:14:35,british rail saw this this was a time when there was a lot of interest in space and they thought maybe
00:14:35,00:14:39,let's get ahead of the game here and make sure if if we suddenly discover all the things that he's
00:14:39,00:14:44,predicted sorry not predicted but needs that are not yet around if they suddenly come to
00:14:44,00:14:49,this this might actually work it feels a bit like patent trolling doesn't it because if i
00:14:49,00:14:56,tomorrow managed to come up with a way of making nuclear fusion work so it can power things i don't
00:14:56,00:15:01,want to have to pay 20 percent to british rail because they speculatively said that oh we invented
00:15:01,00:15:06,this thing that is going to be in the future james if you do that and i am not saying you will i'm
00:15:06,00:15:11,saying in fact that you won't but if you did do that you infuse like a hundred years from now
00:15:11,00:15:15,sorry to cross your dreams i feel like you should believe in me okay look as a physics
00:15:15,00:15:19,graduate i'm saying you are the most likely of the four of us to produce nuclear fusion however
00:15:19,00:15:22,but even if you did do that in a podcast a hundred years from now they would be able to say
00:15:22,00:15:27,did you know that actually we have british rail to thank for nuclear fusion it would be like
00:15:27,00:15:33,emi and the ct scan all over again yes they're the beetles yeah or what we'd be saying it's thanks
00:15:33,00:15:37,to a podcast wait a minute are we the beetles in this case i don't think we can say that i think
00:15:37,00:15:41,british rail is the beetles and we're sort of einstein
00:15:41,00:15:48,and people are going did you know it's not actually james harkin who we have to thank for fusion
00:15:48,00:15:54,it's british rail very good yeah and one of the reasons that we didn't know this until quite recently
00:15:54,00:15:59,so it was some like patent fans found it didn't they yeah but one of the reasons that we didn't
00:15:59,00:16:04,find it is because it contained the word nuclear in the patent and when you put the word nuclear in
00:16:04,00:16:09,your patent it kind of often gets given a secrecy order and so you need to go through an extra hoop
00:16:09,00:16:13,to look at those patents really yeah it looked really cool though um if you look at the drawings
00:16:13,00:16:17,on the patent it does look like a proper flying saucer and there's drawings on the inside there's
00:16:17,00:16:23,not proper descriptions of what the inside um how it would fully function it was more trying to focus
00:16:23,00:16:29,on the engineering side of it but it looks to some people who've who've sort of analyzed what
00:16:29,00:16:33,were drawn it looks like it could carry 60 people inside it the way that it looked like they would
00:16:33,00:16:39,be inside it is that if you picture like when you go to a fairground and there's that gravity tunnel
00:16:39,00:16:43,thing where you all stand against the wall and as it spins you get sucked to the wall it's sort of
00:16:43,00:16:48,like that the seats are the seats are arranged around the edge of the inside of the circular
00:16:48,00:16:53,saucer that's an uncomfortable way to travel if you're going by british rail and you have to be
00:16:53,00:16:58,stuck up against the side how are you going to get to the buffet car exactly also they don't work
00:16:58,00:17:03,on me genuinely it doesn't work on me genuinely doesn't work on me i've been on i've been on them
00:17:03,00:17:08,twice and i wouldn't go on again because everyone had to hold my hand as i slid down the wall and
00:17:08,00:17:12,everyone else is stuck up there i was just i just stayed on the floor the floor drops away
00:17:12,00:17:16,this is an even bigger claim than james saying he's going to invent nuclear fusion is that i'm
00:17:16,00:17:23,saying just the laws don't apply to him just this one law isn't it like so the coolest british rail
00:17:23,00:17:31,invention that i came across was uh did you guys know about the pub cars no i know so this is in
00:17:31,00:17:37,1949 british rail decided to launch carriages that were pubs and they were properly decked out like
00:17:37,00:17:43,well they went for moctuda design lovely and the outside of the carriage was all fake brick so it
00:17:43,00:17:50,looked like an idyllic village bricked up to the pub but they put pub signs up i think uh there are
00:17:50,00:17:57,a few of them made no they have names like the white horse the jolly tar the green man thomas the
00:17:57,00:18:03,tanked engine would be an awesome name for one very nice very good very very good but yeah this
00:18:03,00:18:09,happened you could go board your train and sit down have a bite insane yeah and it was it was
00:18:09,00:18:15,discontinued because everyone thought it was really tacky oh they're wrong i went to um i went to
00:18:15,00:18:21,universal studios in america right which is like a theme park isn't it and they have the harry potter
00:18:21,00:18:29,world there and you can get on the um is it called the hogwarts the hogwarts express uh and you can
00:18:29,00:18:34,pretend that you're going across the scottish countryside to get to hogwarts okay um but first
00:18:34,00:18:41,of all you have to queue up in an exact replica of king's cross and then um they have a shop which
00:18:41,00:18:47,is supposed to be exactly the same as a uk railway shop and they're so accurate they sold cans of
00:18:47,00:18:55,strongbow isn't that amazing they sold they had loads of like british brands of like i don't know
00:18:55,00:19:00,what british brands are but like candies and stuff like that round trees but they had cans of strongbow
00:19:00,00:19:06,i've never felt so at home in my life drunk eight-year-olds everywhere yeah running desperately
00:19:06,00:19:13,at platform nine and three quarters so many concussed children since you mentioned harry potter
00:19:13,00:19:17,i just want to say something about king's cross station because you know platform nine and three
00:19:17,00:19:21,quarters the thing that really pisses off harry potter fans about it when you go to king's cross
00:19:21,00:19:26,no where is it it's between platforms eight and nine so basically jk rowling guy station's confused
00:19:26,00:19:30,she meant houston she said king's cross and so they couldn't actually put platform nine and
00:19:30,00:19:34,three quarters between platforms nine and ten so it's between eight and nine and a harry potter
00:19:34,00:19:38,fan goes to king's cross is like oh my god this doesn't make any sense it's not eight and three
00:19:38,00:19:47,quarters wow king's cross could resolve this quite pressing problem because they have 13 platforms
00:19:47,00:19:52,they've got but they've got they've got 13 platforms but their platforms only go up to 11 so one of
00:19:52,00:19:56,them is nine and three quarters which is like a fake one but the other one they needed to add an
00:19:56,00:20:01,extra platform a few years ago and they needed to add it to the left hand side to the opposite side
00:20:01,00:20:05,of platform one and they didn't want to call it platform 12 because they thought that'll confuse
00:20:05,00:20:10,people because it's at the opposite end to like platform 10 11 etc so they called it platform zero
00:20:10,00:20:16,right so what king's cross can do is they rename platform zero platform one yeah as you would rename
00:20:16,00:20:22,platform one platform two etc etc etc you get to platform eight and nine and suddenly platform
00:20:22,00:20:25,nine and three quarters is in the right place it's a great idea i mean you only have one week
00:20:25,00:20:32,probably of people wanting to go to lutan and ended up in glasgow but then once that's happened
00:20:32,00:20:36,a few times people will get wise to it to be honest what's one week more of lost economic
00:20:36,00:20:44,activity for the uk at this point exactly should we talk about ufo's let's do it they're illegal
00:20:44,00:20:51,in chateau nerf de pape you are right will they disturb the grapes don't they that is actually
00:20:51,00:21:00,exactly why it is a really really well kind of yeah so chateau nerf de pape it's a town in southeast
00:21:00,00:21:06,france and they obviously make very good red wine and all the winemakers are quite protective of
00:21:06,00:21:13,their brand and then in the 1950s there was a load of reports in france of these what they called
00:21:13,00:21:19,cigar valance which means flying cigars and there were these kind of ufo's going around and people
00:21:19,00:21:24,saying that they'd seen martians and stuff like that it's just like one of these normal mass hysteria
00:21:24,00:21:28,things where everyone thought they saw ufo's but when that happened all the wine growers were
00:21:28,00:21:35,like well we can't have ufo's around here so they made a law saying that no ufo is allowed to land
00:21:35,00:21:40,in chateau nerf de pape and they're not even allowed to fly over and if any alien lands then
00:21:40,00:21:46,they will be arrested immediately and actually only a few years ago the mayor of chateau nerf de
00:21:46,00:21:50,pape said that they will keep the law on the books so it definitely does exist he said that they
00:21:50,00:21:54,want to keep it because it kind of gives them a little bit of publicity and stuff and it gets them
00:21:54,00:22:00,in the news every now and again when people realize this is the thing but yes if you're an alien then
00:22:00,00:22:04,you like your wine you can't go to chateau nerf de pape do you think do you think there are aliens
00:22:04,00:22:08,in alien air traffic control somewhere going oh we've really need to land in the sort of south
00:22:08,00:22:14,of france region oh but we you remember we can't do it in the pape area because of course
00:22:14,00:22:19,into planetary law i don't know how much they respect into planetary law i think it's a french
00:22:19,00:22:24,law isn't it question is have you ever heard of a ufo landing there Anna that is a good question
00:22:24,00:22:31,and i haven't done point proven point proven they respect it greatly um do you guys know that a
00:22:31,00:22:38,decline in christianity is directly responsible for a massive rise in flying sources in an interesting
00:22:38,00:22:48,way um so this is because in the 1940s there's a there was a belgian company called belgica
00:22:48,00:22:54,and it made communion wafers for church and a decline in christianity meant that there was
00:22:54,00:22:58,suddenly a lot less demand for communion wafers and so they were like well what do we do we've
00:22:58,00:23:02,got this technology but people aren't really buying it anymore and then what they realized was
00:23:02,00:23:09,they could take that paper in communion wafers sandwich some sherbet in between two bits of it
00:23:09,00:23:16,and what you've got there is a flying saucer no the confectionery left by all so hitting so flying
00:23:16,00:23:22,saucers are made from communion wafers same stuff i guess originate yeah yeah that is amazing and i've
00:23:22,00:23:30,got to say the church is really missing out on a way of getting the youth in isn't it yeah if those
00:23:30,00:23:36,wafers exploded in your mouth in the same way that flying sources do i might convert that is cool
00:23:36,00:23:48,okay it is time for fact number three and that is andy my fact is that in 2017 the u.s defense
00:23:48,00:23:54,secretary had a light installed in his bathroom which would turn on if north korea launched a
00:23:54,00:24:03,nuclear missile how stressful wow how stressful who was it that was james when james mattis that's
00:24:03,00:24:09,right jim mattis and this was at the time when north korea was launching it was the big sort of
00:24:09,00:24:16,north korean missile huha of 2017 and it needed urgent response obviously if they launched another
00:24:16,00:24:21,missile although detected doing another nuclear test and this light was installed in his bathroom
00:24:21,00:24:25,so he could see it from the shower if he was having a shower he would be able to immediately
00:24:25,00:24:30,jump out of the shower go downstairs get in the car and go and did he always have to shower in
00:24:30,00:24:37,the dark so that he'd be able to see this light really well i don't know what he had basically
00:24:37,00:24:41,his whole home was rigged up like this huge korean missile booby trap so there was a bell in his
00:24:41,00:24:47,kitchen that was one in his bedroom and i should say this is all from a new book called rage by
00:24:47,00:24:54,bob woodward who is an incredible veteran u.s reporter and these these bells went off on more
00:24:54,00:25:01,than one occasion and he had a car which had to be followed by an suv and inside the suv there was
00:25:01,00:25:06,a team plotting the flight path of any potential incoming nuclear missile and this was just his
00:25:06,00:25:11,life he had a very very stressful life and he slept he slept in his gym clothes didn't he he
00:25:11,00:25:15,had just had to be at the ready yeah time i don't think he should have showered in his clothes as
00:25:15,00:25:23,well otherwise we'll see how often did he end up naked in the emergency vehicles just on on missiles
00:25:23,00:25:29,generally it's astonishing when you look into the history of missile and missile alerts in
00:25:29,00:25:35,the last 70 years and you realize how many times we've come to the brink of essentially nuclear war
00:25:35,00:25:39,based on a what should have been a minor cock up isn't it so there have just been so many
00:25:39,00:25:47,false missile alarms and i think my favorite ones are well one of them was in 1960 when there was
00:25:47,00:25:52,so mid-cold war everyone is very tense to be fair there was radar u.s radar in greenland
00:25:52,00:25:57,which suddenly reported that there were dozens of soviet missiles coming over the horizon exactly
00:25:57,00:26:02,where they'd be expected to be coming from and they were attacking and so the u.s defense command
00:26:02,00:26:09,went into maximum alert um you know things were they were getting ready to retaliate and it turned
00:26:09,00:26:16,out to be the moon so it was all right it was a moon rise over norway which it happened that the
00:26:16,00:26:23,moon reflected back the radar uh in the same way the missile attack might have wow and it came back
00:26:23,00:26:29,with 99.9 percent certainty that they were under soviet attack and that's amazing that's poor
00:26:29,00:26:34,programming isn't it it's because you would think that the moon sometimes rises over norway
00:26:34,00:26:38,and you'd think there would be some kind of anti-moon protocol built into this program yeah
00:26:38,00:26:44,there was another one in 1979 where they believed that they were on the brink of of death as well
00:26:44,00:26:50,and it was um this one guy who was the national security advisor to president corridor so this
00:26:50,00:26:55,is in america where this happened um he woke up with the phone call saying that the soviets had
00:26:55,00:27:02,just launched 250 missiles and it was headed straight for them and he had this weird reaction
00:27:02,00:27:06,where he was in a house full of his family and he didn't bother to wake his wife up because he
00:27:06,00:27:11,assumed that there was no point in troubling her with the fear they were all going to be dead
00:27:11,00:27:16,in the next half hour or so so just leave them and um he sort of casually just accepted that death
00:27:16,00:27:22,was coming and then just waited in all the systems again sort of showed that this was a big mistake
00:27:22,00:27:28,and they couldn't work out what it was turns out it was a video game that had been put accidentally
00:27:28,00:27:34,into the system at norad and they were doing a simulation of what it would be like if they were
00:27:34,00:27:38,attacked but the system thought it was real and it was just a complete cock up yeah so this war
00:27:38,00:27:42,game was playing out and they all thought this was a real thing and they eventually worked that out
00:27:42,00:27:47,and carter never found out until years or at least months down the line that this had in fact happened
00:27:47,00:27:53,I can't imagine not waking up one spouse at a time when you think nuclear war is coming
00:27:53,00:27:58,well that's just your typical selfish attitude isn't it you're suffering you want her to suffer too
00:27:58,00:28:06,you want to be screaming with someone I guess he had a job to do though right like he had
00:28:06,00:28:10,he was the guy who was meant to check in on this you wouldn't want your whole family screaming
00:28:10,00:28:16,around you go as you try to remain calm one of the really scary things is that one of the things
00:28:16,00:28:22,he thought to do in that moment was and this was supposedly the quote I want to make sure that we'd
00:28:22,00:28:27,have company and the idea was he wanted to press a button of retaliation on the Soviets
00:28:27,00:28:32,before they all died so that that was wiped out as well so like like this misfire thing that could
00:28:32,00:28:38,have led to something real as well well that's why there's a lot of controversy still about the
00:28:38,00:28:43,fact that we still have all those cold war things in place which mean that they can retaliate within
00:28:43,00:28:48,minutes and but I think the terrifying thing about that one Dan was that it must have seemed so
00:28:48,00:28:54,perfect right because the the tape I think it was a technician accidentally put this tape into one of
00:28:54,00:29:02,the machines at NORAD which is the North American Aerospace Defense Command and it the whole point
00:29:02,00:29:06,of the simulation was to make it seem like the Soviets had launched the worst possible attack
00:29:06,00:29:10,you know every single nuclear facility was targeted every single missile was targeted
00:29:10,00:29:16,so it must have been like wow they've really got us this time yeah yeah they do have um it's not
00:29:16,00:29:22,just one person presses the button and then the missile goes they have a few safeguards so at any
00:29:22,00:29:28,time in America they have 90 what are called missile ears who are sitting on alert somewhere in the
00:29:28,00:29:35,desert wow they're all underground kind of in these silo places and they work in teams of two
00:29:35,00:29:42,and they each sit together in like on the wall it says a no-lone zone as in you're not allowed to
00:29:42,00:29:47,be alone because if you're on your own you might accidentally start World War 3 without you know
00:29:47,00:29:51,someone telling you not to yeah and you sit two of you in a room and there's an A side and a B
00:29:51,00:29:57,side and you each have a code which you're supposed to put in and if your codes match then that sets
00:29:57,00:30:03,off the bomb but also I think five of the people in the whole thing need to do it at the same time
00:30:03,00:30:10,in order for them to go off and there's 90 of them and in the US military it's mostly men who are
00:30:10,00:30:16,obviously in the in the military um but in that particular one there's a disproportionately high
00:30:16,00:30:22,number of women in that role and the US Air Force um did a big sort of press release in March 2016
00:30:22,00:30:28,because they had the first time that it was an all-female alert so all 90 people who were like in
00:30:28,00:30:32,charge of whether America sends missiles to its enemies were women and that was the first time
00:30:32,00:30:38,that happened all 90 yeah wow so they have an all together they have a team of quite a few hundred
00:30:38,00:30:43,and so normally it would be a mix but on this particular occasion they had the first ever
00:30:43,00:30:49,all-female team obviously you wouldn't want nuclear war to happen ever yeah it does happen then it
00:30:49,00:30:56,would be a nice win for equality if it was the last if it was yeah if I don't know but would it
00:30:56,00:31:03,that I mean some naysayers would say that if the one time when we actually started a nuclear war
00:31:03,00:31:07,was the first time it was all women working up that's a very good point it would I think it would
00:31:07,00:31:12,set back the cause of women working in missile silos across the world well fortunately there
00:31:12,00:31:17,would be no humans around to uh have that problem if there would be some man there was some man would
00:31:17,00:31:25,pop up saying ah if you remember we did try this yes some male cockroach there's that really sweet
00:31:25,00:31:30,story which I think is quite famous I didn't actually know it so I feel like I should mention it
00:31:30,00:31:37,but before norad was called norad it was called konad and konad was the continental air defense
00:31:37,00:31:44,command and one day the air force colonel harry shoup sitting in his office and he gets a phone
00:31:44,00:31:49,call which is on a line which basically suggests that the russians are attacking if this phone
00:31:49,00:31:54,rings the russians are attacking and at the end of the line which he grabs it up nervously expecting
00:31:54,00:32:00,the worse he hears a tiny little voice which says is this santa claus and he thinks what what the
00:32:00,00:32:05,hell's going on here and he barks into the phone back at them say we know what's going on and the
00:32:05,00:32:10,voice is crying he's going is this one of santa's elves and what had happened was there was a huge
00:32:10,00:32:17,mistake there was an advert that was placed in sears catalogue the sears advert which gave out the
00:32:17,00:32:22,number to call santa claus but they put the wrong number in there and the number they ended up giving
00:32:22,00:32:30,was this classified line that was dedicated to a russian missile attack and it's so funny it's
00:32:30,00:32:36,extraordinary that that happens what were the chances it's not just a random person in america
00:32:36,00:32:43,yeah and um what's wonderful about it though is that they decided to embrace it and that is a thing
00:32:43,00:32:49,now that you can call norad and ask them to track where santa is oh in the period of crisis so you
00:32:49,00:32:54,are going to say you can ask them to drop a bomb any way you like for christmas that's what you want
00:32:54,00:33:00,have you been good yes the naughty list consists of vladimir vladimirovich putin
00:33:00,00:33:11,okay and it's time for our final fact of the show and that is james my fact this week is that fashion
00:33:11,00:33:18,historian hillary davidson has invented the bill and ted test which judges the historical accuracy
00:33:18,00:33:23,of movie costumes by comparing them against the surprisingly accurate movie bill and ted's
00:33:23,00:33:29,excellent adventure so i did wonder why everyone in pride and prejudice is wearing backwards caps
00:33:29,00:33:38,well this is really interesting because um this historian um hillary davidson she was actually
00:33:38,00:33:44,writing a book about dress in the age of jane austin uh and when she was writing it there's a lot of
00:33:44,00:33:49,quite boring bits that you have to do of copy editing and indexing and stuff like that and
00:33:49,00:33:54,when she was doing her copy editing of the index as it happens um she was watching movies at the
00:33:54,00:33:59,same time because it was just such a boring tedious job uh and so she was watching bill and ted and
00:33:59,00:34:05,she got to the bit where they kidnapped baithoven and they she kind of looked at the extras and thought
00:34:05,00:34:10,wow they are actually really good they look just like they're supposed to look and so she thought
00:34:10,00:34:15,well that's it i'm a fashion historian i need a benchmark i need to decide what's good and what's
00:34:15,00:34:20,bad so this is my benchmark if you're making a proper regency production and you can't get
00:34:20,00:34:26,it as good as bill and ted then there's something wrong and so now on twitter she has @ bill and ted
00:34:26,00:34:31,test um where whenever she sees a new movie she rates it against bill and ted and sees whether it
00:34:31,00:34:37,passes or fails are there films which uh you know have failed the bill and ted test oh i didn't write
00:34:37,00:34:45,them down um i'm sorry i can't remember star wars star wars big fail but basically she she says there's
00:34:45,00:34:49,a few things you need to look forward the fab ring for instance so if they're wearing something that's
00:34:49,00:34:54,obviously polyester or something like that um then it just looks wrong and you can tell it but the
00:34:54,00:35:03,other thing is the hair so if your hair is um down and you're an adult woman then unless you are
00:35:03,00:35:08,unmarried and a virgin or you're a prostitute or you're mad then you would not have your hair down
00:35:08,00:35:14,for a woman in that kind of period that's a big risk in a singles bar isn't it i mean i think she's
00:35:14,00:35:22,unmarried and a virgin but it's possible she's a mad prostitute yeah and she wants to she does
00:35:22,00:35:28,say in um this interview in slate she she's stressing that she's not saying everyone has to be completely
00:35:28,00:35:33,historically accurate for everything um but sometimes it can if you're an expert it can put
00:35:33,00:35:38,you off a little bit by seeing you know someone wearing a like you say a baseball cap in the
00:35:38,00:35:43,middle of pride and prejudice yeah it might be worth saying for the one person who is not totally
00:35:43,00:35:47,familiar with bill and ted that the reason that it's a good benchmark is because they travel
00:35:47,00:35:52,in time right to lots of different yes um yeah lots of different time periods where they're wearing
00:35:52,00:35:55,the clothes of that period is that right i mean they're not wearing the clothes of that period
00:35:55,00:36:00,they stay in their own mufti throughout but they go and visit people like Beethoven and Socrates
00:36:00,00:36:05,and Napoleon and yeah they must really stand out yeah they do that's kind of where some of the comedy
00:36:05,00:36:11,comes in yeah i mean it is one of the greatest movies ever made in my opinion and it's one of
00:36:11,00:36:16,the probably half a dozen films before 2010 that i've actually seen i think that might be why you
00:36:16,00:36:19,think it's one of the greatest movies ever made if you compare them with the overall number of movies
00:36:19,00:36:24,made um it's so good but they do spend a portion of the movie in the future is that why you've allowed
00:36:24,00:36:31,that to be part of the movies you can watch james yes exactly i love that we have to thank for giving
00:36:31,00:36:39,us bill and ted the thriller post-apocalyptic author richard matheson uh so if you don't know
00:36:39,00:36:45,richard matheson he is the author of i am legend he is an author who steven king said is the greatest
00:36:45,00:36:51,influence uh that steven king has had by another author that is richard matheson he's he's the master
00:36:51,00:36:56,and sorry and if you don't know what i am legend is it's basically 2020 in a book
00:36:56,00:37:04,it's basically a worldwide apocalypse due to disease isn't it yeah exactly it's exactly that
00:37:04,00:37:10,and so richard matheson happens to be the father of chris matheson who is the co-writer and co-creator
00:37:10,00:37:15,along with um his partner solomon of bill and ted and bill and ted was meant to be just a throw
00:37:15,00:37:19,away sketch they had this idea they were going to play the characters live on stage and they
00:37:19,00:37:24,happened to just mention it to richard matheson saying this is the idea that we have for this
00:37:24,00:37:28,sketch and he said i actually think there's a whole movie in this and they thought oh god okay
00:37:28,00:37:32,that's interesting never thought to do that and they wrote up the movie and that's why we have the
00:37:32,00:37:38,most excellent in bogus adventures wasn't it wasn't it almost the most excellent bogus adventures
00:37:38,00:37:43,um or the most excellent adventures of bill ted and bob because initially in their improv group
00:37:43,00:37:48,and the hot it was like constant improvise wasn't it and uh there were three of them but the character
00:37:48,00:37:53,who was playing bob sort of lost interest in the whole concept and disappeared and so ended up just
00:37:53,00:37:57,being the two of them but it's also they were committed to the bill and ted conceit for years
00:37:57,00:38:03,before it materialized into a film they sort of used to like always like keep the improv going
00:38:03,00:38:06,they would write letters to each other in the characters of bill and ted i don't know if that's
00:38:06,00:38:13,a standard improv behaviour andy it's not okay i'm not constantly writing regency themed letters
00:38:13,00:38:18,to my buddies in the group it's a shame a lot of the things with bill and ted how it's come into
00:38:18,00:38:24,the culture is obviously through its language right so um anna if you haven't seen it they
00:38:24,00:38:30,speak in this real kind of surferish slang of saying like bodacious and triumphant and stuff
00:38:30,00:38:35,like that um and i looked in the oxford english dictionary and they're referenced about a dozen
00:38:35,00:38:41,times uh in the oxford english dictionary so they're referenced for um the phrase yes way
00:38:41,00:38:47,as in the opposite of no way oh wow yes way uh they're referenced in dude in the entry for dude
00:38:47,00:38:53,and also in the entry for second base and they're not first citations they're just kind of examples
00:38:53,00:38:59,but they are the first citation of party on so we don't know anyone else who said party on
00:38:59,00:39:04,before bill and ted did and they're the first citation outside of dictionaries of the word
00:39:04,00:39:10,dickweed um so it's it was mentioned outside dictionaries did you say yeah so sometimes
00:39:10,00:39:16,did a lexicographer invent the word dickweed sneak it in hope it would take off and then
00:39:16,00:39:22,sometimes the oed takes like words from slang dictionaries and puts it into the oed but they
00:39:22,00:39:27,didn't have the citation from there but they do have the citation from bill and ted which is
00:39:27,00:39:34,the first one where um bill says you killed ted you medieval dickweed and that's the first example
00:39:34,00:39:40,we have of someone using that in real life so bill and ted is back in the cinemas uh right now
00:39:40,00:39:44,as we speak face the music the third and i thought they'd been this ginormous gap between the last
00:39:44,00:39:48,movie and now that's all the bill and ted that we have but it turns out underneath there's been
00:39:48,00:39:54,so much there was an animated series which had kianu and alex winter and george carlin voicing
00:39:54,00:39:59,it can i just say that was one of the best cartoons i used to love as a kid i used to love
00:39:59,00:40:02,that so much that show didn't know it existed that's the only version of bill and ted that i've
00:40:02,00:40:07,seen is occasionally what really yeah it had an amazing theme tune as well you're gonna find the
00:40:07,00:40:12,theme tune did you see the live series then there was an action series live action series and they
00:40:12,00:40:16,cast people who when you look at the pictures look exactly like the guys but they also went into
00:40:16,00:40:20,theater there was bill and ted's excellent halloween adventure and musical adventure there were
00:40:20,00:40:26,board games there was the excellent board game and riff in time r i f f riff in time um and then
00:40:26,00:40:29,there was a whole comic book series that has been run for years which were written and drawn by a
00:40:29,00:40:36,guy called evan dorkin really yeah and i basically just said all of that so that i can say the word
00:40:36,00:40:41,evan dorkin i was thinking these are standard brand extensions i don't know where dan's going
00:40:41,00:40:48,with this it's always heading to the name dorkin i did find one fact about the comic book which is
00:40:48,00:40:52,that because they use a time traveling phone booth which people might think is a bit a bit of a rip
00:40:52,00:40:59,off from dr who they use the comic book to explain that actually um due to the way time travel works
00:40:59,00:41:04,dr who ripped off bill and ted despite having started in 1960 something that's a brilliant way
00:41:04,00:41:10,to get around the patents problem we had earlier i live the episode absolutely yeah but dr who is
00:41:10,00:41:14,also a time traveler and i would say a more adept time traveler than bill and ted though i haven't
00:41:14,00:41:18,seen it but he is very good at it so i would imagine he can always have claimed to have gone
00:41:18,00:41:23,back he's been to the beginning of the universe yes you know one place that dr who's never been
00:41:23,00:41:29,because he's an alien shat on earth the pap yes i want to see the episode of dr who where he lands
00:41:29,00:41:37,in shat on earth the pap and gets immediately arrested i wrote a such an endearing interview
00:41:37,00:41:42,with um kyana reeves which actually just came out recently but was an interview that he did
00:41:42,00:41:46,in 1987 which is when they were making bill and ted but i think no one knew who he was then
00:41:46,00:41:51,and then the film got delayed so the interview was never released at the time and uh it was for
00:41:51,00:41:57,the rap and he admitted that he wasn't a good actor in fact in it he said uh so i think the
00:41:57,00:42:03,interviewer who was steve steve pond asked him how long have you been acting and kyana reeves said
00:42:03,00:42:09,i don't really know if i'm acting now i'm pretty bad i mean i hate acting most of the time i do
00:42:09,00:42:16,it it's a god awful job just on old awesome movies um this isn't to do with bill and ted um
00:42:16,00:42:22,but our friend are you just using the word awesome as a connectively kind of is but you'll
00:42:22,00:42:27,see where i'm going because they kind of in the same um in the same genre ish so um our friend
00:42:27,00:42:32,justin gayner sent me an article which i'd missed from the guardian which a few people will have seen
00:42:32,00:42:36,about cool runnings then you obviously see this article it's absolutely brilliant it was an interview
00:42:36,00:42:43,with a few people including john turtletown who was the director and he gave some bits of trivia
00:42:43,00:42:48,about cool runnings which are amazing so it was translated around the world and in norway it was
00:42:48,00:42:56,translated as cold buttocks cool runnings and he said that after cool runnings he got sent
00:42:56,00:43:02,lots of similar kind of screenplays about sports uh and they were all kind of almost identical
00:43:02,00:43:07,and he said it got so bad that at one point i received a script called amanda without reading
00:43:07,00:43:11,a word i picked up the phone and said to my agent what kind of animal is it and what's wrong with
00:43:11,00:43:23,the kid there was a long pause before the reply came it's a horse and a brain tube okay that's it
