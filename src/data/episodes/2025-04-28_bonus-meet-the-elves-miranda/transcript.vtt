00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.600
 [Music]

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.520
 Welcome to the latest bit of bonus material just for you!

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.600
 What have we got for you this week? It is an episode of Meet the Elves!

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.960
 And it's someone, one of our one of our researchers who

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.000
 really we should have gotten a long long time ago.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.960
 But every time we ask her she's always too busy making the actual TV show of QI.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.960
 But we have Miranda Brennan! Hello! Hello Miranda!

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.600
 Welcome to the show! Oh what a delight to be here!

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.680
 It's delightful to have you! Top floor of the building!

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.040
 I love it! Welcome, welcome! Welcome out from the engine room!

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.840
 Here we are! It's exciting! We haven't done a Meet the Elf in a while.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.640
 This is one of my favourite things to do. Who are you?

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.080
 Who am I? Well get to that, Dan. It's a question that plagues me daily.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.640
 Let me explain the format very quickly. Miranda's come from downstairs.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.480
 She's got a question for us that she's been researching.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.880
 She's going to ask us a question and we're going to flounder around to try and find the answer.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.400
 Probably fail miserably and eventually she'll put us out of our misery.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.360
 But in the meantime hopefully we'll get to know you a little bit better.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.800
 So why don't we first of all just do the question itself?

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.320
 All right so the question I have brought to you today is,

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.960
 why did long capes and wide brimmed hats go out of fashion in Spain in 1766?

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.880
 Okay, that's a good question and I don't know the answer.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.560
 And I'm sure we'll get, I know we're going to get to the answer, that's the point of this,

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.640
 but we're going to, I'm looking forward to a lengthy stroll to award this answer.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.720
 Okay here's a question first of all. Is fashion one of your kind of

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.800
 things that you like to talk about?

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.720
 It is, I love fashion and costume history, a huge amount.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.960
 I've got a question, are you Spanish?

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.520
 I am not Spanish, I haven't even done Spanish at school and there are going to be some names

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.240
 in this that I am going to mess up the pronunciation of.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.040
 Miranda.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.800
 Is it a Spanish name or is it a Roman language name?

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.920
 It originates from Shakespeare, he coined it in the Tempest.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.840
 No, that's very cool.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.960
 If I get out, well that's it, you won't never find out about the case.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:15.760
 Stay, stay.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:22.560
 When people watch Shakespeare and these like they brought in the character Miranda,

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.920
 and everyone go what the fuck's that?

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:31.760
 Yeah, well he got it from, he adapted a Latin gerund, which who here knows Latin because

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.440
 I did not go to a school that did Latin.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.000
 I think a gerund is like a verb where you...

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.120
 Turns into a noun kind of thing.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.720
 Yeah, so Mirare is to admire, Miranda is she who is admirable.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.920
 Okay, I wonder if Shakespeare's Miranda broke the fourth wall as well,

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.360
 you know, whenever something silly happened.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.680
 When she fell over, whenever she fell over, yeah.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.400
 I love that you brought up falling over because I have quite bad dyspraxia,

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.360
 means I'm quite clumsy.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.360
 I fell off the QI set when we were filming the last series and it was really embarrassing.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.920
 You fell off, I mean there's only were you on the table?

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.280
 Yeah, shaped like a giant Q and there's a tail bit,

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.600
 which is the handle of the magnifying glass in the QI logo and I just stacked it

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.520
 right off that and I just went absolutely posterior over from...

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.960
 An interesting fact, by the way, from then on for the rest of the series,

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.320
 we had to have one of those yellow signs on the set the entire time.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.360
 Yeah, it was like...

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.520
 It's been green screened out in the final roller.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.680
 It's a little yellow gate like you get on a building site, kind of plastic barrier

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.840
 and every time the audience came in, Sandy would say,

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.600
 please mind the barrier.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.040
 We've had a few mishaps and there'd be this ripple if I was in the auditorium.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.880
 All the other elves just turning and looking at me

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.720
 because the mishap is me.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.880
 Wow, but that's, do you know what?

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.320
 You're not the first person to do that.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.720
 I remember James, you were definitely there.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.480
 Andy, I can't remember if you were there at this point.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.240
 We were doing the group photo at the end of the season and the photographer himself

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.400
 as he was walking backwards from the inside,

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.840
 tripped over and absolutely like somersaulted over the set.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.920
 And we've mentioned before that I still have a scarf falling over the set.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.680
 Dressed as a chicken.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.720
 When I was dressed as a chicken.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.760
 Iconic.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.440
 Yeah? Well, I'm also into fashion.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.120
 You're also a fashion icon.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.840
 You actually are.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.280
 You have some great shirts.

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.880
 Dan has something about Spain.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.240
 Do I?

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.480
 Yeah.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.480
 You really like the Spanish accent.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.960
 Jesus.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.480
 Particularly the lisp.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.760
 How does it sound, Dan?

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:28.960
 I'm trying to imagine it.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.080
 No, my mind's here.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.680
 Well, is it a lisp?

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.240
 I'm saying it's an affectation of a cultural way of speaking, right?

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.000
 Yeah, speaking.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.760
 So I am officially... Oh, God.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.360
 You'll get a picture of a nice...

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.480
 We'll move on from that.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.360
 But the reason I bring it up is not just to embarrass Dan,

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.520
 but because there is a theory.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.640
 I'm not sure how true it is that people did the lisp

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.080
 because they were copying a member of the Spanish royalty.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.960
 So I wonder, and there's been lots of stuff in history about people

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.120
 taking on fashion because the royals have taken on that kind of fashion.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.920
 Is this... Am I going in the right direction?

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.080
 Well, the Spanish royal family do come into this a bit.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.720
 So the king at the time is Carlos III.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.680
 Well, Charles III.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.280
 What do we know about Carlos III?

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.800
 I don't know anything about previous kings of Spain.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.320
 Before Franco, I'm a bit of a grey area, to be honest.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.840
 He was the king of the sort.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.120
 Wide brim tats, you said.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.840
 Wide brim tats and long capes.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:28.800
 So...

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.680
 Long capes.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.320
 It'll be...

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.160
 You cut quite a dashing figure.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.200
 Yes, but it's not that it was fashionable

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.800
 because someone was wearing it.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.160
 No. Well, I'm asking why it went out of fashion.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:40.720
 Why it went out of fashion.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.720
 I thought then that king then went out of fashion himself.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.800
 He wasn't known for being wildly fashionable.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:49.040
 Okay.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.600
 Oh, okay.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.000
 Okay.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.080
 Well, let's go in a different direction.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.520
 So we're in Spain.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.400
 We are.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.280
 Why would you wear it?

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.440
 It's hot, but like a big rimmed hat

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.240
 would be good for keeping you in the shade.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.880
 It would.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.120
 And the cape wouldn't, but...

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:06.240
 It's fat.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.640
 Why does the fashion change?

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.240
 Like, we did a big thing on QA ages ago

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.840
 about why American men stop wearing hats.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.920
 And in fact, all men stop wearing hats.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.360
 And right now, only one of the three men

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.720
 of this room is wearing a hat next to Dan,

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.080
 and it's a baseball cap that's on backwards.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.720
 It's not...

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.360
 It is true.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.320
 I went on, I went on a honeymoon to New Orleans

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.680
 and I kind of bullied my husband into buying

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.360
 like a jazz pork pie hat.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.400
 Yeah. Oh, nice.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.760
 And he looks so good in it,

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.080
 but he doesn't really wear it now.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.200
 We're back home.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.720
 Alastair, when you listen to this...

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.160
 Wear the hat.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:36.880
 No, it's...

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.160
 I think that our pot pie hat does look cooler,

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.600
 you know, in context.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.480
 In context.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.200
 On the gangster.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:43.600
 Yeah.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.160
 I've got a fedora or two knocking about at home.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:46.560
 Have you?

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:46.800
 Yeah.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.520
 I've never seen you wear a hat.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.400
 No, you wouldn't.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.120
 They just...

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.320
 I just look like I'm sort of in a production of Bugsy Malone.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.720
 That's not been very well resolved in the costume department.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.720
 It's a change that's rarely seen without a hat.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.240
 I wear hats a lot.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.560
 Yeah, but that's because I'm mostly balding these days.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.920
 But also because I cycle and I think when you've been cycling all day,

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.680
 especially when my hair's long,

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.840
 it just gets such a mess that I just want to cover it up.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.920
 But...

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:14.480
 This is going up definitely, man.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.680
 Like, definitely shade.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.880
 I think shade has got a bit...

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.000
 And I think capes.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.640
 There was a study once that was done

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.360
 that if you make children dress like superheroes,

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.080
 then they get better at doing...

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:26.480
 Flying.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:32.560
 They stood in 200 children that pushed them off a building.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.200
 And the ones that came to the ground later.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.440
 No, they have...

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:42.800
 It gives them more confidence and they do better in like puzzles and...

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:43.600
 Really?

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:44.560
 That's interesting.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.560
 Do they swagger about more, though?

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.440
 I don't know, really.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.920
 I mean, there's probably a case for up to a certain age,

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.600
 all children being dressed as superheroes.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.000
 I think so.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.160
 If that, you know, does help their confidence.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:54.640
 Yeah.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:54.880
 Yeah?

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.400
 Perhaps, essentially, if everyone's dressed as a superhero,

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.440
 then it doesn't work.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:07:59.840
 That's true.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.440
 Because you don't feel special anymore.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.120
 You're all just Spider-Man pointing at each other.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:03.920
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.840
 Well, okay, but then that's a good point.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.040
 Is it the fact that, like, you know,

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.440
 if Jack the Ripper, say, had sort of an attire,

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.240
 you wouldn't want to wear it

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.800
 because you might be identified for something criminal,

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.320
 was everyone pointing at each other

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.320
 because they were wearing a cape and a hat?

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.720
 And there was a villain.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.040
 Dan is on to something here.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:23.760
 Dan is on to something.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.000
 Oh, so the clothes are associated with something negative

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.280
 or someone negative.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:27.680
 Is that it?

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.080
 Or a group of people who were kicked out of Spain.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:30.560
 I'm going to...

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.320
 I'm going for a solve.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.400
 But it won't be a solve.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.520
 Shall I just go for a solve?

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:35.840
 Shall I?

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:36.160
 Shall I?

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:36.320
 Come on.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:36.320
 Shall I?

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:36.320
 Come on.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.600
 Shall I just go for a solve?

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.400
 Shall I just go for a solve?

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.800
 I'm going off Monty Python here.

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.720
 Was it that they looked like the Spanish Inquisition?

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:46.880
 In fairness, Spanish Inquisition is a good call.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.880
 They did have the big white hats.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.480
 Yeah, certainly in the sketch.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.960
 Yeah, that's what I said.

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.480
 That's what I'm going off.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.520
 I don't know what year they were.

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.240
 I was immediately...

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:56.960
 They were around.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:57.440
 Right.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.800
 They lost its entries, I suppose.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:08:59.680
 Yeah, yeah.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.920
 You are on to something with the crime link.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:02.320
 Okay.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:02.800
 Okay.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.600
 Can I go for a solve which I know already is wrong

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.200
 because you've just said about the crime link?

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.160
 So what I'm thinking of is Adora Duncan.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.360
 Goodness.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.600
 The 1920s ballet dancer.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.760
 Which shot forward in time with a violence

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.120
 that was not anticipating.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.880
 Well, there is violence coming then.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:19.600
 Absolutely.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.480
 Just for any lessons you don't know.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:24.000
 The TARDIS is just hurtling for around the 20s.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.520
 Adora Duncan was a dancer.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.400
 She's a famous ballet dancer, a wonderful dancer.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.560
 And she used to love these long flowing scarves.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:30.880
 She did.

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.640
 And one day she was getting in a car

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:33.760
 or she wasn't getting in a car.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:34.720
 She was near a car

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.960
 and her long flowing scarf got caught in the wheel of the car

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.560
 and it went round and round and round

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.000
 and she was killed by it.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:40.800
 By her own scarf.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.240
 She was strangled to death by her scarf.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:42.960
 Crazy.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.120
 All that I'm thinking of when you say floppy

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.400
 wide-brim hats and long capes

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.400
 is that there was some terrible workplace accident

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.360
 which meant that...

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.320
 All of Madrid.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.280
 Well, pretty much, I mean, I can't imagine what that would be.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.880
 But something which then meant,

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.040
 oh, maybe we should wear safer clothing.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.480
 This is a very Edna mode

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.320
 from the Incredibles moment that you're having

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.040
 if you've seen that.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.000
 No kiss.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:02.480
 Exactly.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:02.960
 Exactly.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.160
 So it's not that.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.160
 It's not a health and safety concern.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:08.960
 OK.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:09.920
 Let's go back to the clue around

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.600
 and give us some money to get before I start to talk about it.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.320
 OK, so maybe...

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.360
 Is Carlos III involved?

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.240
 Carlos III appoints someone else who's involved

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.200
 in a ferrure about hats and capes.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.320
 Was there a group of criminals

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.000
 who wore wide-brim hats and long capes?

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.040
 So in the opinion of the finance minister

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.280
 that Carlos III put in charge,

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.200
 there was a problem with criminality

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.600
 in Madrid in particular, but across Spain.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.720
 And he felt that people who could disguise themselves

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:44.000
 in these big hats and big capes were a problem.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:44.960
 Like wearing hoodies.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.360
 Exactly, like wearing hoodies.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.440
 So he introduced some sumptuary laws,

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:54.240
 which I know you have covered before.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.160
 But this is not why they went out to fashion.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.280
 Just to say, in sumptuary law

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:59.360
 is where only certain members of society

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.880
 are allowed to wear certain clothes

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.440
 and it all goes off your class or, you know...

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.600
 You can only wear red trousers if you're...

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.480
 Michael Portillo.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.640
 Yeah, exactly.

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.960
 But as you may know, we haven't solved this yet,

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.480
 because as you probably know, if you ban something,

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.240
 it does not go out of fashion.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.080
 The opposite usually happens.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.120
 Oh, OK.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.680
 So is it Spain's biggest nerd in the 18th century

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.040
 started wearing these clothes?

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.960
 I can't think of who that would be.

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.560
 It's not a nerd, but this is...

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:29.280
 Executioner.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.280
 Oh, my God, I got it.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.120
 James has got it.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.800
 So shall I tell the story now?

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:35.440
 Yeah.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.080
 So there was a guy called Leopoldo de Gregorio,

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.480
 who was the Marques de Escalache,

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:45.600
 who was a Sicilian guy who, King Carlos III,

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.040
 made the Minister for Finance.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:51.760
 And he was very into bringing the Enlightenment to Spain.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.320
 He installed loads of oil lamps,

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.840
 and put all these thousands of lamp-boosts.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:56.720
 Literally enlightened.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:57.440
 Genuinely.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:57.920
 He was like,

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.920
 "There's not going to be any dark corners anymore for crime."

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.720
 And nobody's going to wear a wide-brimmed hat,

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.560
 and nobody's going to wear a long clink.

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:07.120
 You're all going to wear the fashions of the French court,

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.320
 which I greatly admire.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:12.240
 Little tricorns, short wigs, no giant capes.

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.840
 And the French court...

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.520
 Sorry, the Spanish court all went,

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:16.160
 "Oh, yes, of course,"

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.200
 and immediately ditched their massive hats and capes.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.640
 But the general public,

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:25.760
 who were quite cross with Escalache's other reforms,

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.760
 which had driven up the prices of food,

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:28.800
 this was the last straw.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.480
 They were not happy about it.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:32.240
 And they absolutely lost it,

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.240
 and they all popped off in Madrid.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.440
 Right, it was amazing.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.800
 Did they have a riot or something?

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.040
 They had the Hat and Cloak Revolt,

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.960
 which is my favourite thing ever.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.200
 Also known as the Escalache riots.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.640
 But it's brilliant because the story goes

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.840
 that Escalache eschewed all the bailiffs of the city

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.520
 with pairs of shears.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:53.600
 And if they saw someone in a massive hat,

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.560
 they were licensed to forcibly trim the hat

00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:00.240
 and lop off a foot off the cloak.

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.040
 I got a question.

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:04.880
 If you could ban any ice muckloving

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.120
 from people in modern-day London.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.120
 Oh, that's so...

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.320
 I'm so glad you've asked James

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.400
 because I've been preparing a list for some years now.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.040
 Here we go.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:18.560
 Well, the trousers that show your pants?

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:19.040
 Oh, yeah.

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:20.400
 Very, very low slung.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.480
 Very low slung.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.640
 I think any trousers that goes more than three

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.040
 and just below the nipple is basically a crime.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:31.520
 You struggled in the year 2002, then, did you?

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.040
 Oh, it wasn't an easy time for me.

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:34.320
 It wasn't an easy time.

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.160
 That was really the year of the builders' Burmese day.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:36.640
 Absolutely.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:40.000
 And my braces were not, in both senses, did not fit in.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.240
 Have you heard of the Lemon Test in Revolutionary Cuba?

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:44.800
 No, that's that.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:45.200
 No.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.560
 The Lemon Test was where, again,

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.280
 there was kind of a rough justice-sumtry-law thing.

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:52.000
 And there would be gangs of guys on the street.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:52.960
 And if your hair was too long,

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.440
 they'd give you a quick trim to make it shorter.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:59.760
 But also, if your trousers couldn't fit,

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:02.400
 if they dropped a lemon at the top of your trousers,

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.360
 and your trousers were too tight because you were a hippie,

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.800
 you know, those sort of hippie trousers

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.480
 that were very tight around the waist and the bum

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.760
 but flared at the leg.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.400
 And if you couldn't easily get a lemon from top to bottom,

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:15.200
 there'd be a bit of on-the-spot tailoring.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.480
 From bottom to bottom.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:17.280
 Brilliant.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:17.840
 Brilliant.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:18.800
 Bottom to bottom.

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:21.280
 You get a little, get the shears out,

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.040
 and they'd, you know, free a path for the lemon.

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:27.360
 How would you decently proceed upon your merry way?

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.000
 I don't think you could.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.760
 I think part of the point was the intimidation.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.120
 Yeah, yeah.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:31.920
 That's amazing.

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:32.880
 I know.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:33.440
 That's a good one.

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.440
 But then, actually, what you're saying, Andy,

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.920
 is almost the reverse of what you think in the modern day

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.600
 because you don't like the baggy trousers.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.160
 I love baggy trousers by madness.

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:45.440
 I actually really struggled when jeggings

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.640
 were the only thing you could buy.

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:47.200
 Jeggings.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:47.920
 All the jeans.

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:48.160
 Yes.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:48.800
 What were they again?

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:49.920
 They're like jean leggings.

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:51.760
 They're very tight pull-on jeans.

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:52.320
 They're denim.

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.560
 Sometimes.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.760
 They were sort of very stretchy.

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:56.960
 They're definitely denim colour.

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:57.920
 Right, right, right, right.

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.320
 And I didn't hate them, but there was a while

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.440
 when you'd try and buy trousers

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.520
 and everything would be really tight

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:04.800
 and I was sitting there going,

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.120
 "Bring back the bell bottoms of 2002."

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.040
 I'm wearing them around it.

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:10.320
 I think they're just black denim.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.560
 Well, you're working it, you know?

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:13.280
 Well, thank you.

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:13.520
 Good.

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:16.800
 You could come back.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.760
 Lemons in my trousers.

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:23.040
 I just love this image.

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.240
 It's like 11s.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:28.480
 Run from the shears.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:31.360
 Yeah, I mean, I love the image of these bailiffs

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.520
 and I read this biography of the artist Goya,

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:34.720
 who was alive at the time,

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.480
 which is by the art critic Robert Hughes.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.600
 And he has this great line,

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.680
 "Before long the jails of Madrid

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:42.960
 were crammed with indignant and capeless men."

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:48.720
 And I think that line just really made me catapult.

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.240
 So we've had the revolt.

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.680
 Well, the revolt, it kicks off

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:52.720
 because these two gentlemen,

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:54.560
 they whistle provocatively at some guards

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.960
 while wearing enormous capes and hats

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.400
 and it kicks off.

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:01.360
 4,400 of those fancy lamp posts I mentioned, smashed.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.960
 Yeah.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:03.440
 No.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.240
 No, I know.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.840
 What are they going to string people up from now?

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:09.520
 Eskwilash's portrait is burned in the Plaza Maya.

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:10.160
 Oh.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:13.120
 They send a priest to explain their demands to the king

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.320
 and the priest says, you know,

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:16.000
 "They're going to reduce your palace to rubble

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.560
 if you don't let them have their hats and capes."

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:21.200
 And so the king says, "All right, I will comply."

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.920
 It was all Eskwilash's idea anyway.

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.760
 And Eskwilash goes into exile.

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:28.320
 And now everyone in Spain was hats and capes.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.760
 Except that they fall out of fashion.

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:30.480
 The execution.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:30.960
 The execution.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:32.640
 So what happens is everybody says,

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.640
 "Right, hats and capes for life."

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.640
 And then Eskwilash's successor

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:42.000
 is a man named Pedro Pablo Abarca de Bolaia y Jimenez de Urea.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.600
 We're just going to call him Aranda

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.440
 because he's the 10th count of Aranda.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.000
 Aranda.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.240
 He's considerably more thoughtful and charming

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.560
 in his approach than Eskwilash.

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:53.040
 And so rather than pushing any more sumptuary laws,

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:56.480
 he just says, "This is now the uniform of the executioners."

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:59.040
 And everyone goes,

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.600
 "Oh my God, I do not want to look like an executioner

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:04.240
 because that is not a job you want to be associated with."

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:05.760
 Yeah, it's not just that you didn't want to look

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:07.280
 like your executioner, right?

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:10.320
 They were like proper outcasts of the whole city.

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:13.600
 I remember I went to the executioner's house in Nuremberg,

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:14.720
 which you can go and visit.

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:17.920
 And yeah, in all of Europe around that time,

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:20.480
 if you were an executioner, people couldn't touch you.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:21.600
 They couldn't go near you.

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:23.440
 Your whole family were outcasts.

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.920
 And it's why your family, it was why it was a family job.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:29.680
 Because only your children would be the ones,

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:32.240
 sort of the untouchable cast that we're in.

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:34.880
 And you get like, you know, you'd be paid okay,

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:35.920
 but you wouldn't be able to spend it

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:37.280
 because you weren't allowed to go to any shops

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:38.160
 that anyone else was in.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.160
 You get paid okay, and you get a house,

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.640
 which was always in the middle of town and stuff like that.

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.160
 I'm sorry, I've just had a thought, James.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.240
 If I was sentenced to death,

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:48.240
 I would absolutely want to be just exactly the same

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:50.240
 as the executioner because then there would be a chance

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.960
 in the confusion that I could end up executing him

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:53.920
 and make good by escape.

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:54.560
 Very good.

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:55.360
 That's a great idea.

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:57.040
 I am the real executioner.

00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:57.360
 Yeah.

00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:58.320
 I am the real executioner.

00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:58.880
 That's like one of those ways.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:00.000
 There goes the executioner.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.360
 He's running away very fast.

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.920
 Clear path!

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:05.120
 I forgot my accent.

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:06.720
 I don't want to associate with that guy.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:07.440
 Clear the road.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.720
 There he goes.

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:09.200
 Get out!

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:12.560
 Don't executioners, is it or is it only a few countries

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.160
 where they have to cover their heads

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.440
 so no one put the hood?

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:16.960
 Yeah, so that no one knows their face?

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.160
 Some of them.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.000
 I think that was relatively common.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:20.240
 Yeah.

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.560
 But it's the same thing to do as well

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.640
 because your job does require some technical skill

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.160
 and physical finesse.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.440
 I just don't know how you swing a hat.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:27.760
 Exactly.

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:29.920
 How do you swing an axe in a big hat?

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:30.800
 Maybe you're hanging people.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:31.680
 Maybe that's what the executioner is.

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:33.360
 But if you've got a hood on, you can't see what you're doing.

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:34.640
 No, but they've got great peripheral vision.

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:36.280
 - They're like, "The cat eye's out, Andy."

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.760
 - They're a little bit like, "It's still big."

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.560
 - Maybe the hat and cape is day wear, you know?

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:42.880
 It's when you're just walking around town.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:43.720
 - Casual.

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.800
 - Or maybe when they're about to do the execution,

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:49.280
 they turn their big hat backwards like Dan's baseball cap.

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.480
 - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:52.320
 - Cowabunga.

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:56.280
 - That's the last thing you heard before you were killed.

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.860
 (all laughing)

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:01.680
 - Okay, well, did we get the answer?

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:02.960
 - You did get the answer.

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.360
 - Somehow, I don't know how we did it.

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.360
 But thank you very much for joining us, Miranda.

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:08.840
 It's been very nice to meet you.

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.160
 I hope everyone at home has enjoyed meeting you.

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.960
 - We should say, we do know Miranda.

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.240
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.040
 - It's not with us on the top floor.

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.080
 (all laughing)

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.600
 - Who are you all and why am I here?

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.680
 We've worked together for many years, yeah.

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:22.520
 - All right.

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:23.600
 - But yeah, thanks very much for listening.

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.600
 And we'll be back again in a couple of weeks time

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.400
 with some more bonus material.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.320
 If you wanna get in contact with any of us,

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.360
 Miranda, are you on social media or on YouTube?

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:36.800
 - Blue Sky, I'm troublerabbit.bsky.app, but that's it.

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:40.480
 I don't really do anything except post about falling over.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:41.320
 - I do it a lot.

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:44.120
 - All right, if you love the old Bolly Nova content.

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:44.960
 - Yep.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.320
 - You're sad that you've been framed,

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:49.360
 isn't on TV anymore, then follow Miranda.

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.680
 And you're also on Blue Sky.

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.240
 - I am, I'm @andruhunderem.

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:53.080
 - Dan.

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:54.520
 - Instagram @shruggerland.

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:56.520
 - My Instagram is @noseshingersjamesharkin.

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:57.640
 Thank you very much for listening.

00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:58.840
 We'll see you soon.

00:19:58.840 --> 00:19:59.680
 Bye.

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:00.520
 - Bye.

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:01.360
 - Bye.

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:03.940
 (upbeat music)

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:06.520
 (upbeat music)

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:09.100
 (upbeat music)

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:11.680
 (upbeat music)

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:21.680
