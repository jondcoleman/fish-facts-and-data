2
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,520
 Welcome to the latest bit of bonus material just for you!

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,600
 What have we got for you this week? It is an episode of Meet the Elves!

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,960
 And it's someone, one of our one of our researchers who

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,000
 really we should have gotten a long long time ago.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,960
 But every time we ask her she's always too busy making the actual TV show of QI.

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,960
 But we have Miranda Brennan! Hello! Hello Miranda!

8
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,600
 Welcome to the show! Oh what a delight to be here!

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,680
 It's delightful to have you! Top floor of the building!

10
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,040
 I love it! Welcome, welcome! Welcome out from the engine room!

11
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,840
 Here we are! It's exciting! We haven't done a Meet the Elf in a while.

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,640
 This is one of my favourite things to do. Who are you?

13
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,080
 Who am I? Well get to that, Dan. It's a question that plagues me daily.

14
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,640
 Let me explain the format very quickly. Miranda's come from downstairs.

15
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,480
 She's got a question for us that she's been researching.

16
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,880
 She's going to ask us a question and we're going to flounder around to try and find the answer.

17
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,400
 Probably fail miserably and eventually she'll put us out of our misery.

18
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,360
 But in the meantime hopefully we'll get to know you a little bit better.

19
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,800
 So why don't we first of all just do the question itself?

20
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,320
 All right so the question I have brought to you today is,

21
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,960
 why did long capes and wide brimmed hats go out of fashion in Spain in 1766?

22
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,880
 Okay, that's a good question and I don't know the answer.

23
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,560
 And I'm sure we'll get, I know we're going to get to the answer, that's the point of this,

24
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,640
 but we're going to, I'm looking forward to a lengthy stroll to award this answer.

25
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,720
 Okay here's a question first of all. Is fashion one of your kind of

26
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,800
 things that you like to talk about?

27
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,720
 It is, I love fashion and costume history, a huge amount.

28
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,960
 I've got a question, are you Spanish?

29
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,520
 I am not Spanish, I haven't even done Spanish at school and there are going to be some names

30
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,240
 in this that I am going to mess up the pronunciation of.

31
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,040
 Miranda.

32
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,800
 Is it a Spanish name or is it a Roman language name?

33
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,920
 It originates from Shakespeare, he coined it in the Tempest.

34
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,840
 No, that's very cool.

35
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,960
 If I get out, well that's it, you won't never find out about the case.

36
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,760
 Stay, stay.

37
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:22,560
 When people watch Shakespeare and these like they brought in the character Miranda,

38
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,920
 and everyone go what the fuck's that?

39
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:31,760
 Yeah, well he got it from, he adapted a Latin gerund, which who here knows Latin because

40
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,440
 I did not go to a school that did Latin.

41
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,000
 I think a gerund is like a verb where you...

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,120
 Turns into a noun kind of thing.

43
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,720
 Yeah, so Mirare is to admire, Miranda is she who is admirable.

44
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,920
 Okay, I wonder if Shakespeare's Miranda broke the fourth wall as well,

45
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,360
 you know, whenever something silly happened.

46
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,680
 When she fell over, whenever she fell over, yeah.

47
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,400
 I love that you brought up falling over because I have quite bad dyspraxia,

48
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,360
 means I'm quite clumsy.

49
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,360
 I fell off the QI set when we were filming the last series and it was really embarrassing.

50
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,920
 You fell off, I mean there's only were you on the table?

51
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,280
 Yeah, shaped like a giant Q and there's a tail bit,

52
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,600
 which is the handle of the magnifying glass in the QI logo and I just stacked it

53
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,520
 right off that and I just went absolutely posterior over from...

54
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,960
 An interesting fact, by the way, from then on for the rest of the series,

55
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,320
 we had to have one of those yellow signs on the set the entire time.

56
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,360
 Yeah, it was like...

57
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,520
 It's been green screened out in the final roller.

58
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,680
 It's a little yellow gate like you get on a building site, kind of plastic barrier

59
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,840
 and every time the audience came in, Sandy would say,

60
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,600
 please mind the barrier.

61
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:41,040
 We've had a few mishaps and there'd be this ripple if I was in the auditorium.

62
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,880
 All the other elves just turning and looking at me

63
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,720
 because the mishap is me.

64
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,880
 Wow, but that's, do you know what?

65
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,320
 You're not the first person to do that.

66
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,720
 I remember James, you were definitely there.

67
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,480
 Andy, I can't remember if you were there at this point.

68
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:58,240
 We were doing the group photo at the end of the season and the photographer himself

69
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,400
 as he was walking backwards from the inside,

70
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,840
 tripped over and absolutely like somersaulted over the set.

71
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,920
 And we've mentioned before that I still have a scarf falling over the set.

72
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,680
 Dressed as a chicken.

73
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,720
 When I was dressed as a chicken.

74
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,760
 Iconic.

75
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,440
 Yeah? Well, I'm also into fashion.

76
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,120
 You're also a fashion icon.

77
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,840
 You actually are.

78
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,280
 You have some great shirts.

79
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,880
 Dan has something about Spain.

80
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,240
 Do I?

81
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:20,480
 Yeah.

82
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,480
 You really like the Spanish accent.

83
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:22,960
 Jesus.

84
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,480
 Particularly the lisp.

85
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,760
 How does it sound, Dan?

86
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,960
 I'm trying to imagine it.

87
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,080
 No, my mind's here.

88
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,680
 Well, is it a lisp?

89
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,240
 I'm saying it's an affectation of a cultural way of speaking, right?

90
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,000
 Yeah, speaking.

91
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,760
 So I am officially... Oh, God.

92
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,360
 You'll get a picture of a nice...

93
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,480
 We'll move on from that.

94
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,360
 But the reason I bring it up is not just to embarrass Dan,

95
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,520
 but because there is a theory.

96
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,640
 I'm not sure how true it is that people did the lisp

97
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,080
 because they were copying a member of the Spanish royalty.

98
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,960
 So I wonder, and there's been lots of stuff in history about people

99
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,120
 taking on fashion because the royals have taken on that kind of fashion.

100
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,920
 Is this... Am I going in the right direction?

101
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,080
 Well, the Spanish royal family do come into this a bit.

102
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,720
 So the king at the time is Carlos III.

103
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,680
 Well, Charles III.

104
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,280
 What do we know about Carlos III?

105
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,800
 I don't know anything about previous kings of Spain.

106
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,320
 Before Franco, I'm a bit of a grey area, to be honest.

107
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,840
 He was the king of the sort.

108
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,120
 Wide brim tats, you said.

109
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,840
 Wide brim tats and long capes.

110
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,800
 So...

111
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,680
 Long capes.

112
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,320
 It'll be...

113
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,160
 You cut quite a dashing figure.

114
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,200
 Yes, but it's not that it was fashionable

115
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,800
 because someone was wearing it.

116
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,160
 No. Well, I'm asking why it went out of fashion.

117
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:40,720
 Why it went out of fashion.

118
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,720
 I thought then that king then went out of fashion himself.

119
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,800
 He wasn't known for being wildly fashionable.

120
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,040
 Okay.

121
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,600
 Oh, okay.

122
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,000
 Okay.

123
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,080
 Well, let's go in a different direction.

124
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,520
 So we're in Spain.

125
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,400
 We are.

126
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,280
 Why would you wear it?

127
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,440
 It's hot, but like a big rimmed hat

128
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,240
 would be good for keeping you in the shade.

129
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:00,880
 It would.

130
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,120
 And the cape wouldn't, but...

131
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,240
 It's fat.

132
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,640
 Why does the fashion change?

133
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,240
 Like, we did a big thing on QA ages ago

134
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,840
 about why American men stop wearing hats.

135
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,920
 And in fact, all men stop wearing hats.

136
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,360
 And right now, only one of the three men

137
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,720
 of this room is wearing a hat next to Dan,

138
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,080
 and it's a baseball cap that's on backwards.

139
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,720
 It's not...

140
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,360
 It is true.

141
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,320
 I went on, I went on a honeymoon to New Orleans

142
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,680
 and I kind of bullied my husband into buying

143
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,360
 like a jazz pork pie hat.

144
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,400
 Yeah. Oh, nice.

145
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,760
 And he looks so good in it,

146
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,080
 but he doesn't really wear it now.

147
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,200
 We're back home.

148
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,720
 Alastair, when you listen to this...

149
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,160
 Wear the hat.

150
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,880
 No, it's...

151
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,160
 I think that our pot pie hat does look cooler,

152
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,600
 you know, in context.

153
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,480
 In context.

154
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,200
 On the gangster.

155
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,600
 Yeah.

156
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,160
 I've got a fedora or two knocking about at home.

157
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:46,560
 Have you?

158
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:46,800
 Yeah.

159
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,520
 I've never seen you wear a hat.

160
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,400
 No, you wouldn't.

161
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,120
 They just...

162
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,320
 I just look like I'm sort of in a production of Bugsy Malone.

163
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,720
 That's not been very well resolved in the costume department.

164
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,720
 It's a change that's rarely seen without a hat.

165
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,240
 I wear hats a lot.

166
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,560
 Yeah, but that's because I'm mostly balding these days.

167
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,920
 But also because I cycle and I think when you've been cycling all day,

168
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,680
 especially when my hair's long,

169
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,840
 it just gets such a mess that I just want to cover it up.

170
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,920
 But...

171
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,480
 This is going up definitely, man.

172
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,680
 Like, definitely shade.

173
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,880
 I think shade has got a bit...

174
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,000
 And I think capes.

175
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,640
 There was a study once that was done

176
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,360
 that if you make children dress like superheroes,

177
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,080
 then they get better at doing...

178
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,480
 Flying.

179
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:32,560
 They stood in 200 children that pushed them off a building.

180
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,200
 And the ones that came to the ground later.

181
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,440
 No, they have...

182
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,800
 It gives them more confidence and they do better in like puzzles and...

183
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,600
 Really?

184
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,560
 That's interesting.

185
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,560
 Do they swagger about more, though?

186
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,440
 I don't know, really.

187
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,920
 I mean, there's probably a case for up to a certain age,

188
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,600
 all children being dressed as superheroes.

189
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,000
 I think so.

190
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,160
 If that, you know, does help their confidence.

191
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,640
 Yeah.

192
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:54,880
 Yeah?

193
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,400
 Perhaps, essentially, if everyone's dressed as a superhero,

194
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,440
 then it doesn't work.

195
00:07:59,440 --> 00:07:59,840
 That's true.

196
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,440
 Because you don't feel special anymore.

197
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,120
 You're all just Spider-Man pointing at each other.

198
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,920
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

199
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,840
 Well, okay, but then that's a good point.

200
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,040
 Is it the fact that, like, you know,

201
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,440
 if Jack the Ripper, say, had sort of an attire,

202
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,240
 you wouldn't want to wear it

203
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,800
 because you might be identified for something criminal,

204
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,320
 was everyone pointing at each other

205
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,320
 because they were wearing a cape and a hat?

206
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,720
 And there was a villain.

207
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,040
 Dan is on to something here.

208
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,760
 Dan is on to something.

209
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,000
 Oh, so the clothes are associated with something negative

210
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,280
 or someone negative.

211
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:27,680
 Is that it?

212
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,080
 Or a group of people who were kicked out of Spain.

213
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:30,560
 I'm going to...

214
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,320
 I'm going for a solve.

215
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,400
 But it won't be a solve.

216
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,520
 Shall I just go for a solve?

217
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:35,840
 Shall I?

218
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,160
 Shall I?

219
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:36,320
 Come on.

220
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:36,320
 Shall I?

221
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:36,320
 Come on.

222
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,600
 Shall I just go for a solve?

223
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,400
 Shall I just go for a solve?

224
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,800
 I'm going off Monty Python here.

225
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,720
 Was it that they looked like the Spanish Inquisition?

226
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,880
 In fairness, Spanish Inquisition is a good call.

227
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,880
 They did have the big white hats.

228
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,480
 Yeah, certainly in the sketch.

229
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,960
 Yeah, that's what I said.

230
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,480
 That's what I'm going off.

231
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,520
 I don't know what year they were.

232
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,240
 I was immediately...

233
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:56,960
 They were around.

234
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,440
 Right.

235
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,800
 They lost its entries, I suppose.

236
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,680
 Yeah, yeah.

237
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,920
 You are on to something with the crime link.

238
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,320
 Okay.

239
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:02,800
 Okay.

240
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,600
 Can I go for a solve which I know already is wrong

241
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,200
 because you've just said about the crime link?

242
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,160
 So what I'm thinking of is Adora Duncan.

243
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,360
 Goodness.

244
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,600
 The 1920s ballet dancer.

245
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,760
 Which shot forward in time with a violence

246
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,120
 that was not anticipating.

247
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,880
 Well, there is violence coming then.

248
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,600
 Absolutely.

249
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,480
 Just for any lessons you don't know.

250
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,000
 The TARDIS is just hurtling for around the 20s.

251
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,520
 Adora Duncan was a dancer.

252
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,400
 She's a famous ballet dancer, a wonderful dancer.

253
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,560
 And she used to love these long flowing scarves.

254
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:30,880
 She did.

255
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,640
 And one day she was getting in a car

256
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,760
 or she wasn't getting in a car.

257
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,720
 She was near a car

258
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,960
 and her long flowing scarf got caught in the wheel of the car

259
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,560
 and it went round and round and round

260
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,000
 and she was killed by it.

261
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,800
 By her own scarf.

262
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,240
 She was strangled to death by her scarf.

263
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:42,960
 Crazy.

264
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,120
 All that I'm thinking of when you say floppy

265
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,400
 wide-brim hats and long capes

266
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,400
 is that there was some terrible workplace accident

267
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,360
 which meant that...

268
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,320
 All of Madrid.

269
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,280
 Well, pretty much, I mean, I can't imagine what that would be.

270
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,880
 But something which then meant,

271
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,040
 oh, maybe we should wear safer clothing.

272
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,480
 This is a very Edna mode

273
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,320
 from the Incredibles moment that you're having

274
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,040
 if you've seen that.

275
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,000
 No kiss.

276
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,480
 Exactly.

277
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:02,960
 Exactly.

278
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,160
 So it's not that.

279
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,160
 It's not a health and safety concern.

280
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,960
 OK.

281
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,920
 Let's go back to the clue around

282
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,600
 and give us some money to get before I start to talk about it.

283
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,320
 OK, so maybe...

284
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,360
 Is Carlos III involved?

285
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,240
 Carlos III appoints someone else who's involved

286
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,200
 in a ferrure about hats and capes.

287
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,320
 Was there a group of criminals

288
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,000
 who wore wide-brim hats and long capes?

289
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,040
 So in the opinion of the finance minister

290
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,280
 that Carlos III put in charge,

291
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,200
 there was a problem with criminality

292
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,600
 in Madrid in particular, but across Spain.

293
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,720
 And he felt that people who could disguise themselves

294
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:44,000
 in these big hats and big capes were a problem.

295
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,960
 Like wearing hoodies.

296
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,360
 Exactly, like wearing hoodies.

297
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,440
 So he introduced some sumptuary laws,

298
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,240
 which I know you have covered before.

299
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,160
 But this is not why they went out to fashion.

300
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,280
 Just to say, in sumptuary law

301
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,360
 is where only certain members of society

302
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,880
 are allowed to wear certain clothes

303
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,440
 and it all goes off your class or, you know...

304
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,600
 You can only wear red trousers if you're...

305
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,480
 Michael Portillo.

306
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,640
 Yeah, exactly.

307
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,960
 But as you may know, we haven't solved this yet,

308
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,480
 because as you probably know, if you ban something,

309
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,240
 it does not go out of fashion.

310
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,080
 The opposite usually happens.

311
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,120
 Oh, OK.

312
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,680
 So is it Spain's biggest nerd in the 18th century

313
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,040
 started wearing these clothes?

314
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,960
 I can't think of who that would be.

315
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,560
 It's not a nerd, but this is...

316
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,280
 Executioner.

317
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,280
 Oh, my God, I got it.

318
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,120
 James has got it.

319
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,800
 So shall I tell the story now?

320
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,440
 Yeah.

321
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,080
 So there was a guy called Leopoldo de Gregorio,

322
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,480
 who was the Marques de Escalache,

323
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,600
 who was a Sicilian guy who, King Carlos III,

324
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,040
 made the Minister for Finance.

325
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,760
 And he was very into bringing the Enlightenment to Spain.

326
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,320
 He installed loads of oil lamps,

327
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,840
 and put all these thousands of lamp-boosts.

328
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,720
 Literally enlightened.

329
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,440
 Genuinely.

330
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:57,920
 He was like,

331
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,920
 "There's not going to be any dark corners anymore for crime."

332
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,720
 And nobody's going to wear a wide-brimmed hat,

333
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,560
 and nobody's going to wear a long clink.

334
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,120
 You're all going to wear the fashions of the French court,

335
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,320
 which I greatly admire.

336
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,240
 Little tricorns, short wigs, no giant capes.

337
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,840
 And the French court...

338
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,520
 Sorry, the Spanish court all went,

339
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,160
 "Oh, yes, of course,"

340
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,200
 and immediately ditched their massive hats and capes.

341
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,640
 But the general public,

342
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,760
 who were quite cross with Escalache's other reforms,

343
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,760
 which had driven up the prices of food,

344
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,800
 this was the last straw.

345
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,480
 They were not happy about it.

346
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,240
 And they absolutely lost it,

347
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,240
 and they all popped off in Madrid.

348
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,440
 Right, it was amazing.

349
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,800
 Did they have a riot or something?

350
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,040
 They had the Hat and Cloak Revolt,

351
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,960
 which is my favourite thing ever.

352
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,200
 Also known as the Escalache riots.

353
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,640
 But it's brilliant because the story goes

354
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,840
 that Escalache eschewed all the bailiffs of the city

355
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,520
 with pairs of shears.

356
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,600
 And if they saw someone in a massive hat,

357
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,560
 they were licensed to forcibly trim the hat

358
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,240
 and lop off a foot off the cloak.

359
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,040
 I got a question.

360
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,880
 If you could ban any ice muckloving

361
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,120
 from people in modern-day London.

362
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,120
 Oh, that's so...

363
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,320
 I'm so glad you've asked James

364
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,400
 because I've been preparing a list for some years now.

365
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,040
 Here we go.

366
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,560
 Well, the trousers that show your pants?

367
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,040
 Oh, yeah.

368
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,400
 Very, very low slung.

369
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,480
 Very low slung.

370
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,640
 I think any trousers that goes more than three

371
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,040
 and just below the nipple is basically a crime.

372
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,520
 You struggled in the year 2002, then, did you?

373
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,040
 Oh, it wasn't an easy time for me.

374
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,320
 It wasn't an easy time.

375
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,160
 That was really the year of the builders' Burmese day.

376
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:36,640
 Absolutely.

377
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,000
 And my braces were not, in both senses, did not fit in.

378
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,240
 Have you heard of the Lemon Test in Revolutionary Cuba?

379
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:44,800
 No, that's that.

380
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,200
 No.

381
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,560
 The Lemon Test was where, again,

382
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,280
 there was kind of a rough justice-sumtry-law thing.

383
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,000
 And there would be gangs of guys on the street.

384
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,960
 And if your hair was too long,

385
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,440
 they'd give you a quick trim to make it shorter.

386
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,760
 But also, if your trousers couldn't fit,

387
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,400
 if they dropped a lemon at the top of your trousers,

388
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,360
 and your trousers were too tight because you were a hippie,

389
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,800
 you know, those sort of hippie trousers

390
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,480
 that were very tight around the waist and the bum

391
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,760
 but flared at the leg.

392
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,400
 And if you couldn't easily get a lemon from top to bottom,

393
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,200
 there'd be a bit of on-the-spot tailoring.

394
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,480
 From bottom to bottom.

395
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,280
 Brilliant.

396
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:17,840
 Brilliant.

397
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,800
 Bottom to bottom.

398
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,280
 You get a little, get the shears out,

399
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,040
 and they'd, you know, free a path for the lemon.

400
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,360
 How would you decently proceed upon your merry way?

401
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,000
 I don't think you could.

402
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,760
 I think part of the point was the intimidation.

403
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,120
 Yeah, yeah.

404
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,920
 That's amazing.

405
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,880
 I know.

406
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,440
 That's a good one.

407
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,440
 But then, actually, what you're saying, Andy,

408
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,920
 is almost the reverse of what you think in the modern day

409
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,600
 because you don't like the baggy trousers.

410
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,160
 I love baggy trousers by madness.

411
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,440
 I actually really struggled when jeggings

412
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,640
 were the only thing you could buy.

413
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,200
 Jeggings.

414
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:47,920
 All the jeans.

415
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,160
 Yes.

416
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:48,800
 What were they again?

417
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,920
 They're like jean leggings.

418
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,760
 They're very tight pull-on jeans.

419
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,320
 They're denim.

420
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,560
 Sometimes.

421
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,760
 They were sort of very stretchy.

422
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,960
 They're definitely denim colour.

423
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,920
 Right, right, right, right.

424
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,320
 And I didn't hate them, but there was a while

425
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,440
 when you'd try and buy trousers

426
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,520
 and everything would be really tight

427
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,800
 and I was sitting there going,

428
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,120
 "Bring back the bell bottoms of 2002."

429
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,040
 I'm wearing them around it.

430
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,320
 I think they're just black denim.

431
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,560
 Well, you're working it, you know?

432
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,280
 Well, thank you.

433
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:13,520
 Good.

434
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,800
 You could come back.

435
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,760
 Lemons in my trousers.

436
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,040
 I just love this image.

437
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,240
 It's like 11s.

438
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,480
 Run from the shears.

439
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,360
 Yeah, I mean, I love the image of these bailiffs

440
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,520
 and I read this biography of the artist Goya,

441
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,720
 who was alive at the time,

442
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,480
 which is by the art critic Robert Hughes.

443
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,600
 And he has this great line,

444
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,680
 "Before long the jails of Madrid

445
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,960
 were crammed with indignant and capeless men."

446
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:48,720
 And I think that line just really made me catapult.

447
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,240
 So we've had the revolt.

448
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,680
 Well, the revolt, it kicks off

449
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,720
 because these two gentlemen,

450
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,560
 they whistle provocatively at some guards

451
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,960
 while wearing enormous capes and hats

452
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,400
 and it kicks off.

453
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,360
 4,400 of those fancy lamp posts I mentioned, smashed.

454
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,960
 Yeah.

455
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,440
 No.

456
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,240
 No, I know.

457
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,840
 What are they going to string people up from now?

458
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,520
 Eskwilash's portrait is burned in the Plaza Maya.

459
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,160
 Oh.

460
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,120
 They send a priest to explain their demands to the king

461
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,320
 and the priest says, you know,

462
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,000
 "They're going to reduce your palace to rubble

463
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,560
 if you don't let them have their hats and capes."

464
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,200
 And so the king says, "All right, I will comply."

465
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,920
 It was all Eskwilash's idea anyway.

466
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,760
 And Eskwilash goes into exile.

467
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,320
 And now everyone in Spain was hats and capes.

468
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,760
 Except that they fall out of fashion.

469
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,480
 The execution.

470
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:30,960
 The execution.

471
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,640
 So what happens is everybody says,

472
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,640
 "Right, hats and capes for life."

473
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,640
 And then Eskwilash's successor

474
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,000
 is a man named Pedro Pablo Abarca de Bolaia y Jimenez de Urea.

475
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,600
 We're just going to call him Aranda

476
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,440
 because he's the 10th count of Aranda.

477
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,000
 Aranda.

478
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,240
 He's considerably more thoughtful and charming

479
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,560
 in his approach than Eskwilash.

480
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,040
 And so rather than pushing any more sumptuary laws,

481
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,480
 he just says, "This is now the uniform of the executioners."

482
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,040
 And everyone goes,

483
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,600
 "Oh my God, I do not want to look like an executioner

484
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,240
 because that is not a job you want to be associated with."

485
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,760
 Yeah, it's not just that you didn't want to look

486
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,280
 like your executioner, right?

487
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,320
 They were like proper outcasts of the whole city.

488
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,600
 I remember I went to the executioner's house in Nuremberg,

489
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,720
 which you can go and visit.

490
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,920
 And yeah, in all of Europe around that time,

491
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,480
 if you were an executioner, people couldn't touch you.

492
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,600
 They couldn't go near you.

493
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,440
 Your whole family were outcasts.

494
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,920
 And it's why your family, it was why it was a family job.

495
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,680
 Because only your children would be the ones,

496
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,240
 sort of the untouchable cast that we're in.

497
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,880
 And you get like, you know, you'd be paid okay,

498
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,920
 but you wouldn't be able to spend it

499
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,280
 because you weren't allowed to go to any shops

500
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,160
 that anyone else was in.

501
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,160
 You get paid okay, and you get a house,

502
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,640
 which was always in the middle of town and stuff like that.

503
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,160
 I'm sorry, I've just had a thought, James.

504
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,240
 If I was sentenced to death,

505
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,240
 I would absolutely want to be just exactly the same

506
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,240
 as the executioner because then there would be a chance

507
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,960
 in the confusion that I could end up executing him

508
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,920
 and make good by escape.

509
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,560
 Very good.

510
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,360
 That's a great idea.

511
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,040
 I am the real executioner.

512
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,360
 Yeah.

513
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,320
 I am the real executioner.

514
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:58,880
 That's like one of those ways.

515
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,000
 There goes the executioner.

516
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,360
 He's running away very fast.

517
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,920
 Clear path!

518
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,120
 I forgot my accent.

519
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,720
 I don't want to associate with that guy.

520
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,440
 Clear the road.

521
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,720
 There he goes.

522
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,200
 Get out!

523
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,560
 Don't executioners, is it or is it only a few countries

524
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,160
 where they have to cover their heads

525
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,440
 so no one put the hood?

526
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,960
 Yeah, so that no one knows their face?

527
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,160
 Some of them.

528
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,000
 I think that was relatively common.

529
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,240
 Yeah.

530
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,560
 But it's the same thing to do as well

531
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,640
 because your job does require some technical skill

532
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,160
 and physical finesse.

533
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,440
 I just don't know how you swing a hat.

534
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:27,760
 Exactly.

535
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,920
 How do you swing an axe in a big hat?

536
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,800
 Maybe you're hanging people.

537
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,680
 Maybe that's what the executioner is.

538
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,360
 But if you've got a hood on, you can't see what you're doing.

539
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,640
 No, but they've got great peripheral vision.

540
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,280
 - They're like, "The cat eye's out, Andy."

541
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,760
 - They're a little bit like, "It's still big."

542
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,560
 - Maybe the hat and cape is day wear, you know?

543
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,880
 It's when you're just walking around town.

544
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,720
 - Casual.

545
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,800
 - Or maybe when they're about to do the execution,

546
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,280
 they turn their big hat backwards like Dan's baseball cap.

547
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,480
 - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

548
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,320
 - Cowabunga.

549
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,280
 - That's the last thing you heard before you were killed.

550
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,860
 (all laughing)

551
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,680
 - Okay, well, did we get the answer?

552
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,960
 - You did get the answer.

553
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,360
 - Somehow, I don't know how we did it.

554
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,360
 But thank you very much for joining us, Miranda.

555
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,840
 It's been very nice to meet you.

556
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,160
 I hope everyone at home has enjoyed meeting you.

557
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,960
 - We should say, we do know Miranda.

558
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,240
 - Yeah, yeah.

559
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,040
 - It's not with us on the top floor.

560
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,080
 (all laughing)

561
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,600
 - Who are you all and why am I here?

562
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,680
 We've worked together for many years, yeah.

563
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,520
 - All right.

564
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,600
 - But yeah, thanks very much for listening.

565
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,600
 And we'll be back again in a couple of weeks time

566
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,400
 with some more bonus material.

567
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,320
 If you wanna get in contact with any of us,

568
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,360
 Miranda, are you on social media or on YouTube?

569
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,800
 - Blue Sky, I'm troublerabbit.bsky.app, but that's it.

570
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,480
 I don't really do anything except post about falling over.

571
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,320
 - I do it a lot.

572
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,120
 - All right, if you love the old Bolly Nova content.

573
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:44,960
 - Yep.

574
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,320
 - You're sad that you've been framed,

575
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,360
 isn't on TV anymore, then follow Miranda.

576
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,680
 And you're also on Blue Sky.

577
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,240
 - I am, I'm @andruhunderem.

578
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,080
 - Dan.

 Thank you very much for listening.

00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,840
 We'll see you soon.

583
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,680
 Bye.

584
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,520
 - Bye.

585
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,360
 - Bye.

586
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,940
 (upbeat music)

587
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,520
 (upbeat music)

588
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,100
 (upbeat music)

589
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,680
 (upbeat music)
