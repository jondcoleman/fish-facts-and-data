00:00:00,00:00:13,[Music]
00:00:13,00:00:17,Welcome to the latest bit of bonus material just for you!
00:00:17,00:00:21,What have we got for you this week? It is an episode of Meet the Elves!
00:00:21,00:00:24,"And it's someone, one of our one of our researchers who"
00:00:24,00:00:28,really we should have gotten a long long time ago.
00:00:28,00:00:32,But every time we ask her she's always too busy making the actual TV show of QI.
00:00:32,00:00:36,But we have Miranda Brennan! Hello! Hello Miranda!
00:00:36,00:00:39,Welcome to the show! Oh what a delight to be here!
00:00:39,00:00:41,It's delightful to have you! Top floor of the building!
00:00:41,00:00:45,"I love it! Welcome, welcome! Welcome out from the engine room!"
00:00:45,00:00:47,Here we are! It's exciting! We haven't done a Meet the Elf in a while.
00:00:47,00:00:50,This is one of my favourite things to do. Who are you?
00:00:50,00:00:54,"Who am I? Well get to that, Dan. It's a question that plagues me daily."
00:00:56,00:01:00,Let me explain the format very quickly. Miranda's come from downstairs.
00:01:00,00:01:04,She's got a question for us that she's been researching.
00:01:04,00:01:08,She's going to ask us a question and we're going to flounder around to try and find the answer.
00:01:08,00:01:12,Probably fail miserably and eventually she'll put us out of our misery.
00:01:12,00:01:15,But in the meantime hopefully we'll get to know you a little bit better.
00:01:15,00:01:18,So why don't we first of all just do the question itself?
00:01:18,00:01:22,"All right so the question I have brought to you today is,"
00:01:22,00:01:28,why did long capes and wide brimmed hats go out of fashion in Spain in 1766?
00:01:28,00:01:32,"Okay, that's a good question and I don't know the answer."
00:01:32,00:01:36,"And I'm sure we'll get, I know we're going to get to the answer, that's the point of this,"
00:01:36,00:01:42,"but we're going to, I'm looking forward to a lengthy stroll to award this answer."
00:01:42,00:01:46,Okay here's a question first of all. Is fashion one of your kind of
00:01:46,00:01:48,things that you like to talk about?
00:01:48,00:01:52,"It is, I love fashion and costume history, a huge amount."
00:01:52,00:01:54,"I've got a question, are you Spanish?"
00:01:54,00:01:59,"I am not Spanish, I haven't even done Spanish at school and there are going to be some names"
00:01:59,00:02:02,in this that I am going to mess up the pronunciation of.
00:02:02,00:02:03,Miranda.
00:02:03,00:02:06,Is it a Spanish name or is it a Roman language name?
00:02:06,00:02:09,"It originates from Shakespeare, he coined it in the Tempest."
00:02:09,00:02:11,"No, that's very cool."
00:02:11,00:02:14,"If I get out, well that's it, you won't never find out about the case."
00:02:14,00:02:15,"Stay, stay."
00:02:15,00:02:22,"When people watch Shakespeare and these like they brought in the character Miranda,"
00:02:22,00:02:23,and everyone go what the fuck's that?
00:02:23,00:02:31,"Yeah, well he got it from, he adapted a Latin gerund, which who here knows Latin because"
00:02:31,00:02:33,I did not go to a school that did Latin.
00:02:33,00:02:36,I think a gerund is like a verb where you...
00:02:36,00:02:37,Turns into a noun kind of thing.
00:02:37,00:02:42,"Yeah, so Mirare is to admire, Miranda is she who is admirable."
00:02:43,00:02:47,"Okay, I wonder if Shakespeare's Miranda broke the fourth wall as well,"
00:02:47,00:02:49,"you know, whenever something silly happened."
00:02:49,00:02:51,"When she fell over, whenever she fell over, yeah."
00:02:51,00:02:56,"I love that you brought up falling over because I have quite bad dyspraxia,"
00:02:56,00:02:57,means I'm quite clumsy.
00:02:57,00:03:03,I fell off the QI set when we were filming the last series and it was really embarrassing.
00:03:03,00:03:05,"You fell off, I mean there's only were you on the table?"
00:03:05,00:03:09,"Yeah, shaped like a giant Q and there's a tail bit,"
00:03:09,00:03:13,which is the handle of the magnifying glass in the QI logo and I just stacked it
00:03:13,00:03:17,right off that and I just went absolutely posterior over from...
00:03:17,00:03:20,"An interesting fact, by the way, from then on for the rest of the series,"
00:03:20,00:03:24,we had to have one of those yellow signs on the set the entire time.
00:03:24,00:03:25,"Yeah, it was like..."
00:03:25,00:03:27,It's been green screened out in the final roller.
00:03:27,00:03:31,"It's a little yellow gate like you get on a building site, kind of plastic barrier"
00:03:31,00:03:33,"and every time the audience came in, Sandy would say,"
00:03:33,00:03:35,please mind the barrier.
00:03:35,00:03:41,We've had a few mishaps and there'd be this ripple if I was in the auditorium.
00:03:41,00:03:42,All the other elves just turning and looking at me
00:03:42,00:03:44,because the mishap is me.
00:03:44,00:03:46,"Wow, but that's, do you know what?"
00:03:46,00:03:48,You're not the first person to do that.
00:03:48,00:03:50,"I remember James, you were definitely there."
00:03:50,00:03:52,"Andy, I can't remember if you were there at this point."
00:03:52,00:03:58,We were doing the group photo at the end of the season and the photographer himself
00:03:58,00:04:00,"as he was walking backwards from the inside,"
00:04:00,00:04:03,tripped over and absolutely like somersaulted over the set.
00:04:03,00:04:07,And we've mentioned before that I still have a scarf falling over the set.
00:04:07,00:04:09,Dressed as a chicken.
00:04:09,00:04:10,When I was dressed as a chicken.
00:04:10,00:04:11,Iconic.
00:04:11,00:04:13,"Yeah? Well, I'm also into fashion."
00:04:13,00:04:15,You're also a fashion icon.
00:04:15,00:04:15,You actually are.
00:04:15,00:04:17,You have some great shirts.
00:04:17,00:04:18,Dan has something about Spain.
00:04:18,00:04:20,Do I?
00:04:20,00:04:20,Yeah.
00:04:20,00:04:22,You really like the Spanish accent.
00:04:22,00:04:22,Jesus.
00:04:22,00:04:26,Particularly the lisp.
00:04:26,00:04:27,"How does it sound, Dan?"
00:04:27,00:04:28,I'm trying to imagine it.
00:04:28,00:04:30,"No, my mind's here."
00:04:30,00:04:31,"Well, is it a lisp?"
00:04:31,00:04:36,"I'm saying it's an affectation of a cultural way of speaking, right?"
00:04:36,00:04:38,"Yeah, speaking."
00:04:38,00:04:41,"So I am officially... Oh, God."
00:04:41,00:04:43,You'll get a picture of a nice...
00:04:43,00:04:44,We'll move on from that.
00:04:44,00:04:47,"But the reason I bring it up is not just to embarrass Dan,"
00:04:47,00:04:49,but because there is a theory.
00:04:49,00:04:52,I'm not sure how true it is that people did the lisp
00:04:52,00:04:56,because they were copying a member of the Spanish royalty.
00:04:56,00:05:00,"So I wonder, and there's been lots of stuff in history about people"
00:05:00,00:05:05,taking on fashion because the royals have taken on that kind of fashion.
00:05:05,00:05:07,Is this... Am I going in the right direction?
00:05:07,00:05:10,"Well, the Spanish royal family do come into this a bit."
00:05:10,00:05:12,So the king at the time is Carlos III.
00:05:12,00:05:13,"Well, Charles III."
00:05:13,00:05:15,What do we know about Carlos III?
00:05:15,00:05:18,I don't know anything about previous kings of Spain.
00:05:18,00:05:22,"Before Franco, I'm a bit of a grey area, to be honest."
00:05:22,00:05:23,He was the king of the sort.
00:05:23,00:05:25,"Wide brim tats, you said."
00:05:25,00:05:27,Wide brim tats and long capes.
00:05:27,00:05:28,So...
00:05:28,00:05:29,Long capes.
00:05:29,00:05:30,It'll be...
00:05:30,00:05:32,You cut quite a dashing figure.
00:05:32,00:05:35,"Yes, but it's not that it was fashionable"
00:05:35,00:05:36,because someone was wearing it.
00:05:37,00:05:40,"No. Well, I'm asking why it went out of fashion."
00:05:40,00:05:40,Why it went out of fashion.
00:05:40,00:05:44,I thought then that king then went out of fashion himself.
00:05:44,00:05:48,He wasn't known for being wildly fashionable.
00:05:48,00:05:49,Okay.
00:05:49,00:05:49,"Oh, okay."
00:05:49,00:05:50,Okay.
00:05:50,00:05:52,"Well, let's go in a different direction."
00:05:52,00:05:53,So we're in Spain.
00:05:53,00:05:54,We are.
00:05:54,00:05:55,Why would you wear it?
00:05:55,00:05:57,"It's hot, but like a big rimmed hat"
00:05:57,00:06:00,would be good for keeping you in the shade.
00:06:00,00:06:00,It would.
00:06:00,00:06:05,"And the cape wouldn't, but..."
00:06:05,00:06:06,It's fat.
00:06:06,00:06:08,Why does the fashion change?
00:06:08,00:06:10,"Like, we did a big thing on QA ages ago"
00:06:10,00:06:11,about why American men stop wearing hats.
00:06:11,00:06:13,"And in fact, all men stop wearing hats."
00:06:13,00:06:15,"And right now, only one of the three men"
00:06:15,00:06:16,"of this room is wearing a hat next to Dan,"
00:06:16,00:06:18,and it's a baseball cap that's on backwards.
00:06:18,00:06:18,It's not...
00:06:18,00:06:19,It is true.
00:06:19,00:06:22,"I went on, I went on a honeymoon to New Orleans"
00:06:22,00:06:25,and I kind of bullied my husband into buying
00:06:25,00:06:27,like a jazz pork pie hat.
00:06:27,00:06:28,"Yeah. Oh, nice."
00:06:28,00:06:29,"And he looks so good in it,"
00:06:29,00:06:32,but he doesn't really wear it now.
00:06:32,00:06:33,We're back home.
00:06:33,00:06:34,"Alastair, when you listen to this..."
00:06:35,00:06:36,Wear the hat.
00:06:36,00:06:36,"No, it's..."
00:06:36,00:06:40,"I think that our pot pie hat does look cooler,"
00:06:40,00:06:41,"you know, in context."
00:06:41,00:06:42,In context.
00:06:42,00:06:43,On the gangster.
00:06:43,00:06:43,Yeah.
00:06:43,00:06:46,I've got a fedora or two knocking about at home.
00:06:46,00:06:46,Have you?
00:06:46,00:06:46,Yeah.
00:06:46,00:06:49,I've never seen you wear a hat.
00:06:49,00:06:50,"No, you wouldn't."
00:06:50,00:06:51,They just...
00:06:51,00:06:54,I just look like I'm sort of in a production of Bugsy Malone.
00:06:54,00:06:56,That's not been very well resolved in the costume department.
00:06:56,00:06:58,It's a change that's rarely seen without a hat.
00:06:58,00:07:00,I wear hats a lot.
00:07:00,00:07:02,"Yeah, but that's because I'm mostly balding these days."
00:07:04,00:07:07,"But also because I cycle and I think when you've been cycling all day,"
00:07:07,00:07:09,"especially when my hair's long,"
00:07:09,00:07:11,it just gets such a mess that I just want to cover it up.
00:07:11,00:07:13,But...
00:07:13,00:07:14,"This is going up definitely, man."
00:07:14,00:07:15,"Like, definitely shade."
00:07:15,00:07:16,I think shade has got a bit...
00:07:16,00:07:18,And I think capes.
00:07:18,00:07:20,There was a study once that was done
00:07:20,00:07:23,"that if you make children dress like superheroes,"
00:07:23,00:07:26,then they get better at doing...
00:07:26,00:07:26,Flying.
00:07:26,00:07:32,They stood in 200 children that pushed them off a building.
00:07:33,00:07:37,And the ones that came to the ground later.
00:07:37,00:07:39,"No, they have..."
00:07:39,00:07:42,It gives them more confidence and they do better in like puzzles and...
00:07:42,00:07:43,Really?
00:07:43,00:07:44,That's interesting.
00:07:44,00:07:46,"Do they swagger about more, though?"
00:07:46,00:07:47,"I don't know, really."
00:07:47,00:07:49,"I mean, there's probably a case for up to a certain age,"
00:07:49,00:07:51,all children being dressed as superheroes.
00:07:51,00:07:52,I think so.
00:07:52,00:07:54,"If that, you know, does help their confidence."
00:07:54,00:07:54,Yeah.
00:07:54,00:07:54,Yeah?
00:07:54,00:07:58,"Perhaps, essentially, if everyone's dressed as a superhero,"
00:07:58,00:07:59,then it doesn't work.
00:07:59,00:07:59,That's true.
00:07:59,00:08:01,Because you don't feel special anymore.
00:08:01,00:08:03,You're all just Spider-Man pointing at each other.
00:08:03,00:08:03,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:08:03,00:08:05,"Well, okay, but then that's a good point."
00:08:05,00:08:09,"Is it the fact that, like, you know,"
00:08:09,00:08:11,"if Jack the Ripper, say, had sort of an attire,"
00:08:11,00:08:12,you wouldn't want to wear it
00:08:12,00:08:14,"because you might be identified for something criminal,"
00:08:14,00:08:16,was everyone pointing at each other
00:08:16,00:08:18,because they were wearing a cape and a hat?
00:08:18,00:08:20,And there was a villain.
00:08:20,00:08:23,Dan is on to something here.
00:08:23,00:08:23,Dan is on to something.
00:08:23,00:08:26,"Oh, so the clothes are associated with something negative"
00:08:26,00:08:27,or someone negative.
00:08:27,00:08:27,Is that it?
00:08:27,00:08:30,Or a group of people who were kicked out of Spain.
00:08:30,00:08:30,I'm going to...
00:08:30,00:08:32,I'm going for a solve.
00:08:32,00:08:34,But it won't be a solve.
00:08:34,00:08:35,Shall I just go for a solve?
00:08:35,00:08:35,Shall I?
00:08:35,00:08:36,Shall I?
00:08:36,00:08:36,Come on.
00:08:36,00:08:36,Shall I?
00:08:36,00:08:36,Come on.
00:08:36,00:08:37,Shall I just go for a solve?
00:08:37,00:08:38,Shall I just go for a solve?
00:08:38,00:08:40,I'm going off Monty Python here.
00:08:40,00:08:42,Was it that they looked like the Spanish Inquisition?
00:08:42,00:08:46,"In fairness, Spanish Inquisition is a good call."
00:08:46,00:08:48,They did have the big white hats.
00:08:48,00:08:50,"Yeah, certainly in the sketch."
00:08:50,00:08:52,"Yeah, that's what I said."
00:08:52,00:08:54,That's what I'm going off.
00:08:54,00:08:55,I don't know what year they were.
00:08:55,00:08:56,I was immediately...
00:08:56,00:08:56,They were around.
00:08:56,00:08:57,Right.
00:08:57,00:08:58,"They lost its entries, I suppose."
00:08:58,00:08:59,"Yeah, yeah."
00:08:59,00:09:01,You are on to something with the crime link.
00:09:01,00:09:02,Okay.
00:09:02,00:09:02,Okay.
00:09:02,00:09:05,Can I go for a solve which I know already is wrong
00:09:05,00:09:07,because you've just said about the crime link?
00:09:07,00:09:10,So what I'm thinking of is Adora Duncan.
00:09:10,00:09:11,Goodness.
00:09:11,00:09:13,The 1920s ballet dancer.
00:09:13,00:09:15,Which shot forward in time with a violence
00:09:15,00:09:17,that was not anticipating.
00:09:17,00:09:18,"Well, there is violence coming then."
00:09:18,00:09:19,Absolutely.
00:09:19,00:09:20,Just for any lessons you don't know.
00:09:20,00:09:24,The TARDIS is just hurtling for around the 20s.
00:09:24,00:09:25,Adora Duncan was a dancer.
00:09:25,00:09:28,"She's a famous ballet dancer, a wonderful dancer."
00:09:28,00:09:30,And she used to love these long flowing scarves.
00:09:30,00:09:30,She did.
00:09:30,00:09:32,And one day she was getting in a car
00:09:32,00:09:33,or she wasn't getting in a car.
00:09:33,00:09:34,She was near a car
00:09:34,00:09:36,and her long flowing scarf got caught in the wheel of the car
00:09:36,00:09:38,and it went round and round and round
00:09:38,00:09:40,and she was killed by it.
00:09:40,00:09:40,By her own scarf.
00:09:40,00:09:42,She was strangled to death by her scarf.
00:09:42,00:09:42,Crazy.
00:09:42,00:09:45,All that I'm thinking of when you say floppy
00:09:45,00:09:46,wide-brim hats and long capes
00:09:46,00:09:48,is that there was some terrible workplace accident
00:09:48,00:09:49,which meant that...
00:09:49,00:09:50,All of Madrid.
00:09:50,00:09:53,"Well, pretty much, I mean, I can't imagine what that would be."
00:09:53,00:09:54,"But something which then meant,"
00:09:54,00:09:57,"oh, maybe we should wear safer clothing."
00:09:57,00:09:58,This is a very Edna mode
00:09:58,00:10:00,from the Incredibles moment that you're having
00:10:00,00:10:01,if you've seen that.
00:10:01,00:10:02,No kiss.
00:10:02,00:10:02,Exactly.
00:10:02,00:10:02,Exactly.
00:10:02,00:10:06,So it's not that.
00:10:06,00:10:08,It's not a health and safety concern.
00:10:08,00:10:08,OK.
00:10:08,00:10:09,Let's go back to the clue around
00:10:09,00:10:11,and give us some money to get before I start to talk about it.
00:10:11,00:10:12,"OK, so maybe..."
00:10:12,00:10:15,Is Carlos III involved?
00:10:15,00:10:18,Carlos III appoints someone else who's involved
00:10:18,00:10:21,in a ferrure about hats and capes.
00:10:21,00:10:22,Was there a group of criminals
00:10:22,00:10:24,who wore wide-brim hats and long capes?
00:10:24,00:10:29,So in the opinion of the finance minister
00:10:29,00:10:31,"that Carlos III put in charge,"
00:10:31,00:10:33,there was a problem with criminality
00:10:33,00:10:35,"in Madrid in particular, but across Spain."
00:10:35,00:10:38,And he felt that people who could disguise themselves
00:10:38,00:10:44,in these big hats and big capes were a problem.
00:10:44,00:10:44,Like wearing hoodies.
00:10:44,00:10:47,"Exactly, like wearing hoodies."
00:10:47,00:10:51,"So he introduced some sumptuary laws,"
00:10:51,00:10:54,which I know you have covered before.
00:10:54,00:10:56,But this is not why they went out to fashion.
00:10:56,00:10:57,"Just to say, in sumptuary law"
00:10:57,00:10:59,is where only certain members of society
00:10:59,00:11:00,are allowed to wear certain clothes
00:11:00,00:11:03,"and it all goes off your class or, you know..."
00:11:03,00:11:05,You can only wear red trousers if you're...
00:11:05,00:11:06,Michael Portillo.
00:11:06,00:11:08,"Yeah, exactly."
00:11:08,00:11:10,"But as you may know, we haven't solved this yet,"
00:11:10,00:11:14,"because as you probably know, if you ban something,"
00:11:14,00:11:16,it does not go out of fashion.
00:11:16,00:11:18,The opposite usually happens.
00:11:18,00:11:19,"Oh, OK."
00:11:19,00:11:21,So is it Spain's biggest nerd in the 18th century
00:11:21,00:11:23,started wearing these clothes?
00:11:23,00:11:24,I can't think of who that would be.
00:11:25,00:11:28,"It's not a nerd, but this is..."
00:11:28,00:11:29,Executioner.
00:11:29,00:11:31,"Oh, my God, I got it."
00:11:31,00:11:33,James has got it.
00:11:33,00:11:34,So shall I tell the story now?
00:11:34,00:11:35,Yeah.
00:11:35,00:11:38,"So there was a guy called Leopoldo de Gregorio,"
00:11:38,00:11:40,"who was the Marques de Escalache,"
00:11:40,00:11:45,"who was a Sicilian guy who, King Carlos III,"
00:11:45,00:11:47,made the Minister for Finance.
00:11:47,00:11:51,And he was very into bringing the Enlightenment to Spain.
00:11:51,00:11:54,"He installed loads of oil lamps,"
00:11:54,00:11:55,and put all these thousands of lamp-boosts.
00:11:55,00:11:56,Literally enlightened.
00:11:56,00:11:57,Genuinely.
00:11:57,00:11:57,"He was like,"
00:11:57,00:11:59,"""There's not going to be any dark corners anymore for crime."""
00:11:59,00:12:02,"And nobody's going to wear a wide-brimmed hat,"
00:12:02,00:12:04,and nobody's going to wear a long clink.
00:12:04,00:12:07,"You're all going to wear the fashions of the French court,"
00:12:07,00:12:08,which I greatly admire.
00:12:08,00:12:12,"Little tricorns, short wigs, no giant capes."
00:12:12,00:12:13,And the French court...
00:12:13,00:12:15,"Sorry, the Spanish court all went,"
00:12:15,00:12:16,"""Oh, yes, of course,"""
00:12:16,00:12:19,and immediately ditched their massive hats and capes.
00:12:19,00:12:20,"But the general public,"
00:12:21,00:12:25,"who were quite cross with Escalache's other reforms,"
00:12:25,00:12:27,"which had driven up the prices of food,"
00:12:27,00:12:28,this was the last straw.
00:12:28,00:12:30,They were not happy about it.
00:12:30,00:12:32,"And they absolutely lost it,"
00:12:32,00:12:34,and they all popped off in Madrid.
00:12:34,00:12:35,"Right, it was amazing."
00:12:35,00:12:36,Did they have a riot or something?
00:12:36,00:12:39,"They had the Hat and Cloak Revolt,"
00:12:39,00:12:40,which is my favourite thing ever.
00:12:40,00:12:43,Also known as the Escalache riots.
00:12:43,00:12:46,But it's brilliant because the story goes
00:12:46,00:12:49,that Escalache eschewed all the bailiffs of the city
00:12:49,00:12:51,with pairs of shears.
00:12:51,00:12:53,"And if they saw someone in a massive hat,"
00:12:53,00:12:56,they were licensed to forcibly trim the hat
00:12:56,00:13:00,and lop off a foot off the cloak.
00:13:00,00:13:01,I got a question.
00:13:01,00:13:04,If you could ban any ice muckloving
00:13:04,00:13:07,from people in modern-day London.
00:13:07,00:13:09,"Oh, that's so..."
00:13:09,00:13:10,I'm so glad you've asked James
00:13:10,00:13:12,because I've been preparing a list for some years now.
00:13:12,00:13:13,Here we go.
00:13:13,00:13:18,"Well, the trousers that show your pants?"
00:13:18,00:13:19,"Oh, yeah."
00:13:19,00:13:20,"Very, very low slung."
00:13:20,00:13:22,Very low slung.
00:13:22,00:13:24,I think any trousers that goes more than three
00:13:24,00:13:27,and just below the nipple is basically a crime.
00:13:27,00:13:31,"You struggled in the year 2002, then, did you?"
00:13:31,00:13:33,"Oh, it wasn't an easy time for me."
00:13:33,00:13:34,It wasn't an easy time.
00:13:34,00:13:36,That was really the year of the builders' Burmese day.
00:13:36,00:13:36,Absolutely.
00:13:36,00:13:40,"And my braces were not, in both senses, did not fit in."
00:13:40,00:13:44,Have you heard of the Lemon Test in Revolutionary Cuba?
00:13:44,00:13:44,"No, that's that."
00:13:44,00:13:45,No.
00:13:45,00:13:46,"The Lemon Test was where, again,"
00:13:46,00:13:49,there was kind of a rough justice-sumtry-law thing.
00:13:49,00:13:52,And there would be gangs of guys on the street.
00:13:52,00:13:52,"And if your hair was too long,"
00:13:52,00:13:55,they'd give you a quick trim to make it shorter.
00:13:55,00:13:59,"But also, if your trousers couldn't fit,"
00:13:59,00:14:02,"if they dropped a lemon at the top of your trousers,"
00:14:02,00:14:05,"and your trousers were too tight because you were a hippie,"
00:14:05,00:14:06,"you know, those sort of hippie trousers"
00:14:06,00:14:08,that were very tight around the waist and the bum
00:14:08,00:14:09,but flared at the leg.
00:14:09,00:14:12,"And if you couldn't easily get a lemon from top to bottom,"
00:14:12,00:14:15,there'd be a bit of on-the-spot tailoring.
00:14:15,00:14:16,From bottom to bottom.
00:14:16,00:14:17,Brilliant.
00:14:17,00:14:17,Brilliant.
00:14:17,00:14:18,Bottom to bottom.
00:14:18,00:14:21,"You get a little, get the shears out,"
00:14:21,00:14:23,"and they'd, you know, free a path for the lemon."
00:14:23,00:14:27,How would you decently proceed upon your merry way?
00:14:27,00:14:28,I don't think you could.
00:14:28,00:14:29,I think part of the point was the intimidation.
00:14:29,00:14:31,"Yeah, yeah."
00:14:31,00:14:31,That's amazing.
00:14:31,00:14:32,I know.
00:14:32,00:14:33,That's a good one.
00:14:33,00:14:35,"But then, actually, what you're saying, Andy,"
00:14:35,00:14:37,is almost the reverse of what you think in the modern day
00:14:37,00:14:39,because you don't like the baggy trousers.
00:14:39,00:14:42,I love baggy trousers by madness.
00:14:43,00:14:45,I actually really struggled when jeggings
00:14:45,00:14:46,were the only thing you could buy.
00:14:46,00:14:47,Jeggings.
00:14:47,00:14:47,All the jeans.
00:14:47,00:14:48,Yes.
00:14:48,00:14:48,What were they again?
00:14:48,00:14:49,They're like jean leggings.
00:14:49,00:14:51,They're very tight pull-on jeans.
00:14:51,00:14:52,They're denim.
00:14:52,00:14:54,Sometimes.
00:14:54,00:14:55,They were sort of very stretchy.
00:14:55,00:14:56,They're definitely denim colour.
00:14:56,00:14:57,"Right, right, right, right."
00:14:57,00:15:00,"And I didn't hate them, but there was a while"
00:15:00,00:15:01,when you'd try and buy trousers
00:15:01,00:15:03,and everything would be really tight
00:15:03,00:15:04,"and I was sitting there going,"
00:15:04,00:15:07,"""Bring back the bell bottoms of 2002."""
00:15:07,00:15:09,I'm wearing them around it.
00:15:09,00:15:10,I think they're just black denim.
00:15:10,00:15:12,"Well, you're working it, you know?"
00:15:12,00:15:13,"Well, thank you."
00:15:13,00:15:13,Good.
00:15:13,00:15:16,You could come back.
00:15:16,00:15:19,Lemons in my trousers.
00:15:19,00:15:23,I just love this image.
00:15:23,00:15:24,It's like 11s.
00:15:24,00:15:28,Run from the shears.
00:15:28,00:15:31,"Yeah, I mean, I love the image of these bailiffs"
00:15:31,00:15:33,"and I read this biography of the artist Goya,"
00:15:33,00:15:34,"who was alive at the time,"
00:15:34,00:15:36,which is by the art critic Robert Hughes.
00:15:36,00:15:37,"And he has this great line,"
00:15:37,00:15:39,"""Before long the jails of Madrid"
00:15:39,00:15:42,"were crammed with indignant and capeless men."""
00:15:42,00:15:48,And I think that line just really made me catapult.
00:15:48,00:15:50,So we've had the revolt.
00:15:50,00:15:51,"Well, the revolt, it kicks off"
00:15:51,00:15:52,"because these two gentlemen,"
00:15:52,00:15:54,they whistle provocatively at some guards
00:15:54,00:15:56,while wearing enormous capes and hats
00:15:56,00:15:58,and it kicks off.
00:15:58,00:16:01,"4,400 of those fancy lamp posts I mentioned, smashed."
00:16:01,00:16:02,Yeah.
00:16:02,00:16:03,No.
00:16:03,00:16:04,"No, I know."
00:16:04,00:16:05,What are they going to string people up from now?
00:16:05,00:16:09,Eskwilash's portrait is burned in the Plaza Maya.
00:16:09,00:16:10,Oh.
00:16:10,00:16:13,They send a priest to explain their demands to the king
00:16:13,00:16:14,"and the priest says, you know,"
00:16:14,00:16:16,"""They're going to reduce your palace to rubble"
00:16:16,00:16:18,"if you don't let them have their hats and capes."""
00:16:18,00:16:21,"And so the king says, ""All right, I will comply."""
00:16:21,00:16:23,It was all Eskwilash's idea anyway.
00:16:23,00:16:25,And Eskwilash goes into exile.
00:16:25,00:16:28,And now everyone in Spain was hats and capes.
00:16:28,00:16:29,Except that they fall out of fashion.
00:16:29,00:16:30,The execution.
00:16:30,00:16:30,The execution.
00:16:30,00:16:32,"So what happens is everybody says,"
00:16:32,00:16:34,"""Right, hats and capes for life."""
00:16:34,00:16:36,And then Eskwilash's successor
00:16:37,00:16:42,is a man named Pedro Pablo Abarca de Bolaia y Jimenez de Urea.
00:16:42,00:16:43,We're just going to call him Aranda
00:16:43,00:16:45,because he's the 10th count of Aranda.
00:16:45,00:16:46,Aranda.
00:16:46,00:16:48,He's considerably more thoughtful and charming
00:16:48,00:16:50,in his approach than Eskwilash.
00:16:50,00:16:53,"And so rather than pushing any more sumptuary laws,"
00:16:53,00:16:56,"he just says, ""This is now the uniform of the executioners."""
00:16:56,00:16:59,"And everyone goes,"
00:16:59,00:17:01,"""Oh my God, I do not want to look like an executioner"
00:17:01,00:17:04,"because that is not a job you want to be associated with."""
00:17:04,00:17:05,"Yeah, it's not just that you didn't want to look"
00:17:05,00:17:07,"like your executioner, right?"
00:17:07,00:17:10,They were like proper outcasts of the whole city.
00:17:10,00:17:13,"I remember I went to the executioner's house in Nuremberg,"
00:17:13,00:17:14,which you can go and visit.
00:17:14,00:17:17,"And yeah, in all of Europe around that time,"
00:17:17,00:17:20,"if you were an executioner, people couldn't touch you."
00:17:20,00:17:21,They couldn't go near you.
00:17:21,00:17:23,Your whole family were outcasts.
00:17:23,00:17:25,"And it's why your family, it was why it was a family job."
00:17:25,00:17:29,"Because only your children would be the ones,"
00:17:29,00:17:32,sort of the untouchable cast that we're in.
00:17:32,00:17:34,"And you get like, you know, you'd be paid okay,"
00:17:34,00:17:35,but you wouldn't be able to spend it
00:17:35,00:17:37,because you weren't allowed to go to any shops
00:17:37,00:17:38,that anyone else was in.
00:17:38,00:17:40,"You get paid okay, and you get a house,"
00:17:40,00:17:42,which was always in the middle of town and stuff like that.
00:17:42,00:17:44,"I'm sorry, I've just had a thought, James."
00:17:44,00:17:46,"If I was sentenced to death,"
00:17:46,00:17:48,I would absolutely want to be just exactly the same
00:17:48,00:17:50,as the executioner because then there would be a chance
00:17:50,00:17:52,in the confusion that I could end up executing him
00:17:52,00:17:53,and make good by escape.
00:17:53,00:17:54,Very good.
00:17:54,00:17:55,That's a great idea.
00:17:55,00:17:57,I am the real executioner.
00:17:57,00:17:57,Yeah.
00:17:57,00:17:58,I am the real executioner.
00:17:58,00:17:58,That's like one of those ways.
00:17:58,00:18:00,There goes the executioner.
00:18:00,00:18:01,He's running away very fast.
00:18:01,00:18:03,Clear path!
00:18:03,00:18:05,I forgot my accent.
00:18:05,00:18:06,I don't want to associate with that guy.
00:18:06,00:18:07,Clear the road.
00:18:07,00:18:08,There he goes.
00:18:08,00:18:09,Get out!
00:18:09,00:18:12,"Don't executioners, is it or is it only a few countries"
00:18:12,00:18:14,where they have to cover their heads
00:18:14,00:18:15,so no one put the hood?
00:18:15,00:18:16,"Yeah, so that no one knows their face?"
00:18:16,00:18:18,Some of them.
00:18:18,00:18:20,I think that was relatively common.
00:18:20,00:18:20,Yeah.
00:18:20,00:18:22,But it's the same thing to do as well
00:18:22,00:18:24,because your job does require some technical skill
00:18:24,00:18:26,and physical finesse.
00:18:26,00:18:27,I just don't know how you swing a hat.
00:18:27,00:18:27,Exactly.
00:18:27,00:18:29,How do you swing an axe in a big hat?
00:18:29,00:18:30,Maybe you're hanging people.
00:18:30,00:18:31,Maybe that's what the executioner is.
00:18:31,00:18:33,"But if you've got a hood on, you can't see what you're doing."
00:18:33,00:18:34,"No, but they've got great peripheral vision."
00:18:34,00:18:36,"- They're like, ""The cat eye's out, Andy."""
00:18:36,00:18:38,"- They're a little bit like, ""It's still big."""
00:18:38,00:18:41,"- Maybe the hat and cape is day wear, you know?"
