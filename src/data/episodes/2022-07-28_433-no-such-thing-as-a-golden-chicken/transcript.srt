00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish. Hope you're all

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:10,200
 very well. I have a little bit of news here and it is of particular interest to people

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:17,120
 in the UK and of particular interest to people who love our mother ship of the TV show QI.

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:22,400
 Now you all know QI, it's facts, it's funny, it's just like fish but it's been going for

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:32,000
 a full 20 years and the big news is that all 20 series of QI are now available on BBC iPlayer.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,320
 So as you probably know, each series of QI is represented by a letter of the alphabet

7
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:43,300
 and so you can go back and watch facts about astronomy, about bees, about campanology, about

8
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:49,400
 dog, well you get the idea. It's 20 series of QI, so many facts, so many amazing moments

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:54,920
 from over the years and it is all as I said available on BBC iPlayer. And of course it

10
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,640
 wouldn't be a top of the show announcement if I didn't remind you all that we are going

11
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,200
 back on the road in autumn, if you live in Scotland or in Wales or indeed I think we

12
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:10,120
 have one show coming up also in London then do go to qi.com/fishevents and get your tickets

13
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:14,200
 fast because I know for a fact that some of those dates are just on the verge of selling

14
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:19,720
 out. Anyway, before you go to iPlayer to binge on all the episodes of QI, we better get on

15
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:31,440
 with this week's show so on with the podcast!

16
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:42,840
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

17
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,520
 to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here

18
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,400
 with James Harkin, Anna Tyshinski and Andrew Hunter Murray and once again we have gathered

19
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:57,080
 round the microphones with our four favourite facts from the last seven days and in no particular

20
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:03,080
 order here we go. Starting with fact number one, that is Andy.

21
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:10,760
 My fact is that in 1944 the book The Great Gatsby sold 120 copies. In 1945 the number

22
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:21,760
 of copies printed was 155,000! I didn't realise how I was going to deliver it until I got

23
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,440
 towards the end and I thought 'I've just said 120, why not say 155?' Anyway, great behind

24
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,600
 the scenes. We've got to show how the sausage is made.

25
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,960
 So The Great Gatsby by F Scott Fitzgerald was a book that was quite popular at first

26
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:42,400
 and then it really tailed off. By 1944 pretty much no one was buying it and it was practically

27
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,320
 out of print. So then in the Second World War though there was this mad scheme that was

28
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:52,040
 run by a load of American publishing titans. They clubbed together and they formed this

29
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,720
 thing called the Council on Books in Wartime and they decided that they wanted to print

30
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,160
 and sell millions of books to the army. So the army bought the books and then those books

31
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:08,760
 were distributed free to the soldiers and they were made incredibly cheap and 122 million

32
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,720
 books were given away to soldiers. And it basically created the paperback book market

33
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,600
 in America. They weren't really popular.

34
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,280
 And they were to fit in the pocket weren't they?

35
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,280
 Yeah.

36
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,280
 Which is why Gatsby is good because it's unbelievably short.

37
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,280
 It is.

38
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,440
 Yeah, but if you were shot and it like went plowed straight through your copy of The Great

39
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,440
 Gatsby.

40
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,720
 You'd rather have Alar as Sherch the Tom Perdue though.

41
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:34,400
 You know, like one volume on each breath, two on your back.

42
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,720
 Go on, where are the other three going?

43
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,720
 One over the genitals and one on either side of the head.

44
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,720
 Maybe two over the genitals.

45
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,720
 So he died in 1940.

46
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,720
 Fitzgerald.

47
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,120
 Yeah, Fitzgerald died in 1940. The book was originally published in 1925. He didn't achieve

48
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:55,160
 any success in his life much to the point of like we all know that book and his name

49
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,320
 now. Was this the moment that made him a global writer?

50
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,320
 Yeah, pretty much.

51
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:04,880
 He was very famous as a literary figure in the early 20s for his first couple of books

52
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,560
 or book. It was beautiful in the damned wasn't it that he wrote which did very well and he

53
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,760
 was a famous figure on the literary scene. He made a good amount of money. But it was

54
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,720
 just that Gatsby when it came out in the early 20s was quite well received by some people

55
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,720
 and not by others.

56
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,720
 Yeah.

57
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,720
 It was just like when a book comes out.

58
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,720
 He thought it was brilliant.

59
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,720
 He thought it was like the Great American level.

60
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,720
 His review was a five star.

61
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,720
 Yeah.

62
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,920
 But it was only after the war that it became accepted that it was the Great American level.

63
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,920
 Exactly.

64
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,920
 Yeah.

65
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,120
 Like so from these days it sells about half a million copies every year compared with

66
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,120
 a hundred and twenty copies just you know a few years after his death. I mean it was

67
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,120
 it was no way.

68
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,120
 So this year it sold about five hundred.

69
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,120
 Thousand!

70
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,120
 Exactly.

71
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,120
 Cool.

72
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,120
 I didn't see where you were going with that.

73
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,120
 Yeah.

74
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,320
 Like I said these books came to fit in your pocket right?

75
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,320
 Yeah.

76
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,200
 There was two different sizes. One to fit in your shirt pocket. One to fit in your pants.

77
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,720
 They were quite flimsy. They cost six cents each to make.

78
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,720
 Yeah.

79
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,120
 So you can still get hold of them today and Andy seeing us today is your publication day

80
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,120
 for your novel.

81
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,120
 Oh.

82
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,120
 I brought you a gift.

83
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,120
 OMG.

84
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,120
 And that is one of these books.

85
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,120
 Oh my God.

86
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,120
 Rumble rumble rumble.

87
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,120
 Which one is it?

88
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,200
 Well I couldn't get hold of the Great Gatsby unfortunately but this is the selected plays

89
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,200
 of Eugene O'Neill.

90
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,200
 Oh my God.

91
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,200
 But it is genuinely one of the ones that was given to the armed services.

92
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,200
 Oh that is so cool.

93
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,200
 Wow.

94
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,200
 Thank you.

95
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,600
 So take it out. Let's see the flimsiness of it.

96
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,600
 This is so cool.

97
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,320
 They were kind of printed in landscape.

98
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,320
 Yeah.

99
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,320
 Yeah.

100
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,320
 And they would have two columns.

101
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,320
 I'm seeing that right now and it's shocking to see.

102
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,320
 Sorry, go on.

103
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,320
 Way broader than it is, too.

104
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:42,200
 But they would have two columns on each page so you get more in than a normal book in

105
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,200
 quite a small amount.

106
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,200
 That's so cool.

107
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,200
 Oh thank you James.

108
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,200
 That's awesome.

109
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,240
 And it says overseas edition for the armed forces distributed by blah blah blah published

110
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,560
 by Editions for the Armed Services.

111
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,280
 So another place that owns these books is the University of Texas which has about 1400

112
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,280
 books.

113
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,840
 And because they were printed on magazine presses, so they were very, they really worked

114
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,840
 out.

115
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,760
 And they sort of printed them like a magazine and then they just sliced it in half.

116
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,280
 So the University of Texas ones, they're really brittle and brown these days because

117
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,520
 you know the paper was not designed to last for 80 years and they're kept in I think

118
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:20,520
 called tuxedo cases, which is described as an acid-free enclosure to keep them pristine.

119
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,520
 I have looked, it just looks like they're in a box.

120
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,640
 Do most boxes have lots of acid in them?

121
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,280
 I don't have my boxes specified there, acid-free, does that mean they're full of acid?

122
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,720
 Unfortunately librarians kept putting them in with the acid.

123
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,720
 There's big acid vats they have in libraries.

124
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,880
 So comic books were quite popular, Terry and the Pirates was one of the ones that was quite

125
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:47,200
 popular by a cartoonist called Milton Caniff and the ones that he did for the military

126
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:53,040
 contained, and this is a quote, "Damsels as breasty and near nude as Caniff dared draw

127
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,040
 them."

128
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,040
 Wow.

129
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,600
 So he took his quite like normal comic strip and thought, well this is for the soldiers,

130
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,560
 so I'm going to add boobs.

131
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,560
 Nice.

132
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:09,360
 Speaking of comic books and associated culture, the video game Legend of Zelda, we probably

133
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,280
 remember playing as children, or adults maybe?

134
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,280
 I bought one recently actually.

135
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,040
 That's absolutely fine and no judgement here.

136
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,000
 It was named after Zelda Fitzgerald, Scott's wife.

137
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,760
 I don't know that.

138
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,760
 Although who else might it be named after, it's not a very common name, is it, Zelda?

139
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,720
 She was named after two random other people from books, wasn't she?

140
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,640
 She was named after someone from a book, wasn't she?

141
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,520
 Yeah, I think her mum found two references to Zelda.

142
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,840
 Hang on, was it like, oh it wasn't like someone called Zelina and someone called Darth?

143
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,840
 No.

144
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:45,200
 Fitzgerald, just as his career, I didn't realise that he had a bit of a moment.

145
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,440
 A moment in Hollywood, you know, potentially he was going to be one of the biggest Hollywood

146
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,400
 script writers, but he just didn't quite get the break that he needed, and he was part

147
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,880
 of this group that were called the legions of jerks, and that was a name given to them

148
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:03,320
 by Jack Warner, and it was quite an amazing pack of writers that were working for Hollywood

149
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,960
 in that time, in that sort of underneath that name.

150
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,240
 So you had Aldous Huxley, you had Anthony Powell, you had Dorothy Parker.

151
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,520
 It's basically the Algonquin group, really, sounds like.

152
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,360
 So interesting, yeah, but they were all there trying to pump out scripts, and like Fitzgerald

153
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,000
 was brought on, I don't think they used any of his work for it, but he did a week on

154
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 Gone With The Wind.

155
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 It didn't.

156
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 Yeah, like, it's sort of.

157
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,840
 Didn't he go there because Zelda had got sick and he needed to make some money or something?

158
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,840
 Yes, so he was really, yeah.

159
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,080
 He was going through a bad patch, there's a lot of rumours that he was an alcoholic in

160
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,360
 this period, and he was, he had a lot of alcoholic problems, but I think in this specific moment

161
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,880
 with Hollywood, he was actually quite productive, and he was off the alcohol, he was drinking

162
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,760
 cases of Coca-Cola, apparently, to sort of, you know, replace one addiction with another,

163
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,760
 just distract himself.

164
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:53,000
 And he produced a lot of work, and there's something like 2000 pages in an archive sitting

165
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,320
 somewhere of screenplays, of doctored scripts that he did, but virtually none of them, except

166
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,800
 I think one credit he has properly for a movie.

167
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,120
 He wasn't very, like, he only wrote a few novels, and there were a few batches of short

168
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,480
 stories, and I don't know, the whole thing seems to have gone off a bit half-cocked his

169
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,280
 life, you know, it just wasn't very, he joined the army hoping to die, I didn't know this

170
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:18,680
 in the First World War, so he'd been rejected by a woman called Genevra, and again, weird,

171
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:23,720
 weird name, Genevra de Zelda, anyway, he'd been rejected by her, she'd said, "no, absolutely

172
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,720
 not."

173
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,280
 I think she was extremely wealthy, and he was extremely not wealthy, and so he joined the

174
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:37,680
 army hoping to die, trained under Dwight Eisenhower, and then he quickly wrote a 120,000 word

175
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,560
 novel in the hope that it would sell before he died, and then, anyway, the war ended,

176
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:46,480
 so he was fine, because the period where you were American and then being trained and then

177
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,440
 definitely getting to the war was quite a narrow window because of how late America joined

178
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,440
 the First World War, so.

179
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,920
 Quite impressive to quickly write 120,000 word novel, you've just written enough for

180
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,920
 Andy.

181
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,440
 Do you think you could have spaffed that out in terms between army service?

182
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,480
 Spaffed out is a funny way of putting a heart and soul into something, but...

183
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,840
 Well, there was an interesting thing about that, wasn't there, because later on it took

184
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:12,640
 him a bit longer to write the novels, he couldn't just spaff them out, but when Zelda got sick

185
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,120
 because she had mental problems, right, mental issues, and he was kind of looking after her

186
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,720
 and going to Hollywood and doing all this stuff, and so it took even longer for him

187
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,320
 to write his novel, and at the same time, Zelda decided to write a novel called Save

188
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:30,720
 Me the Waltz, which he thought used all of his material, and what had actually done,

189
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,400
 it was about their life, right, so who it belongs to, it belongs to whoever writes it

190
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,560
 first, but he was really annoyed because it had taken him ages to do it, but she managed

191
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,560
 to write her novel in three months.

192
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,560
 Wow.

193
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,560
 Yeah.

194
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,560
 Ouch.

195
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,560
 That is good.

196
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,040
 It got a bit spicy between them during the Tenderest of the Night Save Me the Waltz rivalry.

197
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,400
 It doesn't sound good.

198
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:55,200
 When, well, they obviously, Zelda and Scott Fitzgerald were the Richard Burton and Elizabeth

199
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,200
 Taylor of that day, and yes, that is the most modern analogy I can come up with.

200
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,920
 Which was basically the same day, they weren't too far off.

201
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,200
 You're right, it was about 10 years later.

202
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,200
 Sorry, God.

203
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:11,160
 Anyway, yeah, when Zelda said she was going to write Save Me the Waltz, Scott was so annoyed

204
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,560
 that he wrote to the person who was going to publish her book saying, "Don't you dare

205
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,560
 publish it."

206
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:20,040
 He's got diary entries where he basically plots how to make sure that she doesn't write

207
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,360
 it, so he says, "Attack on all grounds.

208
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,920
 Play Brackets the Press," as in if she's writing a play, suppress it, "Novel Brackets

209
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:32,240
 Delay," pictures, "Brackets the Press," as in she did a lot of art, "Child," as in

210
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,520
 the child they had, "Brackets Detach."

211
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,520
 It sounds really bad.

212
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,520
 It is pretty bad.

213
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,520
 It does sound awful.

214
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:43,760
 It was one slight situation was that apparently her doctor said it was bad for her to write

215
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:49,120
 novels, apparently, and so that might have been one of the reasons why he tried to stop

216
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,120
 her.

217
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,120
 Got it.

218
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,960
 But they did have a chat about who was going to publish what, where he accused her of being

219
00:11:54,960 --> 00:12:01,480
 a third-rate writer, a useless society woman with an Amazonian and lesbian personality,

220
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,360
 which, look, she didn't, she didn't love it, but all relationships have problems.

221
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,080
 Well, the thing is, when he said, "You're a third-rate writer," she said, "It seems

222
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,640
 to me you're making a rather violent attack if I'm third-rate."

223
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,640
 Yeah.

224
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,760
 I mean, he was quite attacked for his writing, wasn't he?

225
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,720
 He wasn't the best writer himself.

226
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,720
 As in the editing process.

227
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,720
 Wow.

228
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,720
 Huge claim.

229
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,720
 I'm not claiming it.

230
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,160
 I mean, Simon Wilson, who was a critic.

231
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,280
 One of the greatest writers of all time.

232
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,560
 You did just say he wasn't the best writer himself.

233
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,520
 I'm saying there was a lot of criticism towards his writing at the time.

234
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,960
 So this side of paradise, one of the critics wrote one of the most illiterate books of

235
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,600
 any merit actually published.

236
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,160
 Supposedly, in the Great Gatsby editing process, punctuation marks just had to be removed because

237
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,040
 there were, like, hundreds of them, and he just kept chucking them in, and they're like,

238
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,040
 "Let's get that back out."

239
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,520
 That's what copy editors are for.

240
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,520
 Exactly.

241
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,520
 Do any of that.

242
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:54,360
 So definitely in the Great Gatsby has got to be Jordan Baker because she's a golfer.

243
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,360
 Okay.

244
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,360
 Okay.

245
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,360
 My gosh.

246
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,680
 She is a friend of Daisy, and she is based on a real-life person called Edith Cummings,

247
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:09,000
 who was a friend of the Fitzgeralds, and in the book, Jordan Baker has got a bad reputation

248
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,800
 that she kind of cheats in golf, but at the time, people saw that it was based on this

249
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:19,200
 Edith Cummings and said that actually Edith Cummings was as honest as she was bewitching

250
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,120
 because she was famous for being a very, very attractive golfer.

251
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,840
 She was known as the Fairway Flapper, and she was the first golfer of any gender to

252
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,680
 appear on the cover of Time Magazine.

253
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,680
 Oh, cool.

254
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,680
 Yeah.

255
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,680
 I can believe you found the golf angle in...

256
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,680
 I know.

257
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,680
 Of course, it's Gerald.

258
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,180
 Like, there's always a way, isn't there?

259
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:39,920
 You see a very distant fairway you think, "I can get there."

260
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,920
 What's that?

261
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,920
 Fitzgerald?

262
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,400
 He called Zelda something flapper as well.

263
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,400
 Flapper was just a flapper.

264
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,400
 A fashionable woman.

265
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,400
 Oh, yeah.

266
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,400
 I'd never heard that.

267
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,400
 No, no.

268
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,240
 But Zelda was good at golf, by the way, just to get us back to golf.

269
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,240
 Sorry to try and move it away.

270
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,080
 So, Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald used to spend the summers at White Bear Lake where

271
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:01,080
 there was a golf course, and apparently she was much better at golf than he was.

272
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,400
 Oh, he went up like that.

273
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,680
 So him and Zelda had quite an interesting start to their marriage.

274
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:11,400
 I don't know how well she comes across, so she was a very high society, very wealthy.

275
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:16,720
 I think her father was a Supreme Court judge or something, and he was fine, but as you

276
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,840
 can see, if you read The Great Gatsby, he's kind of obsessed with this posh people versus

277
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,240
 not posh people.

278
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,080
 And so, Zelda felt that he was beneath her, and so they had a relationship, and then

279
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,440
 she kind of dumped him for being too poor.

280
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,720
 And then he wrote, I think it was he wrote This Side of Paradise.

281
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,960
 It sold out in three days.

282
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:38,120
 He suddenly made lots of money, and within a week, she'd gone, "All right, let's get

283
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,120
 married."

284
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,120
 Fair enough.

285
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:45,120
 So, F. Scott Fitzgerald's secretary, Francis Kroll, right, the last secretary in his life.

286
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,080
 Okay, F. Scott Fitzgerald died in 1940, okay, age 44.

287
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,120
 When do you think his last secretary died?

288
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,120
 Yesterday.

289
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:57,080
 Okay, let's say she was 20 when she was his secretary in 1944, and she died when she was

290
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,080
 100.

291
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,280
 The maths is going very badly for me, I don't like when people work it out.

292
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,280
 So she's still alive?

293
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,280
 Yeah, all right.

294
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,880
 Okay, guys, you've really taken the sting out of this one.

295
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,960
 She's dead.

296
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:12,840
 She died in 2015, aged 99, so one year off, James, but I just think that's amazing that,

297
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,360
 you know, she would have remembered being F. Scott Fitzgerald's secretary, but she also

298
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,360
 saw, what's an event, like the alternative vote referendum, or...

299
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:25,440
 Do you think those will be her two main memories on her deathbeds, life flattered before my

300
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,440
 eyes, the AV referendum?

301
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,680
 The Scottish independence vote, you know?

302
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,480
 Cannot believe that's the only place you could go from there, okay?

303
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,480
 The 2012 Olympics.

304
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,520
 The fall of the burning wall.

305
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,840
 When was it, 2015?

306
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,840
 2015.

307
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,840
 The...

308
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,840
 When she died?

309
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,840
 Yeah, yeah.

310
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,840
 The premiere ship.

311
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,840
 No, sadly.

312
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,840
 But she might have heard the first few episodes and know such thing as a fish, which is...

313
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,840
 Oh my God!

314
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,840
 Maybe that's what killed her then.

315
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:59,120
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

316
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,840
 Okay, my fact this week is that to protect the city of Syracuse, Archimedes invented

317
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:10,400
 a giant claw that could lift enemy ships clean out of the water.

318
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:15,840
 It was so successful that Roman soldiers began to be scared of any piece of rope hanging

319
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,240
 from the city walls.

320
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,280
 This is, I just to quickly say, fucking insane.

321
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,280
 It's amazing, isn't it?

322
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,280
 It's incredible.

323
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:28,280
 So, why were they scared of rope if it was the giant claw that...

324
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,280
 Because that's what presages the giant claw, isn't it?

325
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,280
 Is it?

326
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,280
 Yeah.

327
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,520
 Because you have a little bit of rope and you're like, "Oh shit, what's that rope attached

328
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,520
 to?"

329
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,520
 And it's attached to the claw?

330
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,520
 Could be.

331
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,080
 So does a rope lead out ahead of the claw?

332
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,640
 Well, you need the rope, because the thing is with Archimedes, he was going to leave

333
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,600
 us some pulleys and stuff like that, so they all have ropes involved.

334
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,600
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

335
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,600
 And I've seen drawings of this.

336
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,680
 I mean, it's like a real life size, you know, when you go to the arcades and you've got

337
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,240
 the claw that you're trying to pick the time.

338
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,840
 It's like this giant claw that is just...

339
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:01,800
 I don't think they're contemporary drawings, the ones that you've seen.

340
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,320
 They might be imaginations.

341
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,320
 Yeah, exactly.

342
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:09,000
 But like, to show what size claw you'd need to pick up a ship, it's pretty big.

343
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 Okay.

344
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,760
 So this is around two on two B.C., we're talking the Second Punic War.

345
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,160
 Rome has taken over all of Italy, but they need somewhere else to take over.

346
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:24,440
 So they go down to Sicily, which is where Archimedes lived, and it was currently owned

347
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:28,040
 by Carthage, which is modern-day Tunisia.

348
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:32,920
 But then the Romans managed to take over it, but then the people in Syracuse, the main

349
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,840
 city, decided they're going to rise up.

350
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:39,920
 So they start to rise up against the Romans, the Romans siege the city, and then Archimedes,

351
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,120
 the great mathematician, lives there, and he's like, "Well, I'm going to come up with

352
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:48,360
 all these great contraptions that are going to stop the Romans from taking our city."

353
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,360
 And this was one of these.

354
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,120
 And the earliest we have for this particular claw thing is by someone called Polybius, who

355
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,120
 was writing only about 50 years after Archimedes died.

356
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,200
 So it's the reasonable chance that it was true.

357
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,520
 Do you know what's amazing about this fact is that one of the great Archimedes stories

358
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,160
 is that he created a sort of death ray for incoming ships.

359
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,760
 So they would point mirrors, and they would use and harness the sun, and that would give

360
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,760
 this great beam that would burn holes into the ships, and so on.

361
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,760
 Turns out that's not true.

362
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,160
 Now, that's such a shame, because that's such a wonderful thing.

363
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:24,640
 It's very rare that you then get given this gift of an even more batshit idea, and that

364
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,200
 turns out to be true.

365
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,200
 We don't know.

366
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,680
 So this is all stuff that's reported about him after.

367
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,320
 So that's Galen said that three centuries later, or something, about the death ray.

368
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,360
 And we think it's probably not true, because it seems completely impossible that you do

369
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:41,440
 it, mostly because to focus a death ray, so the idea was you'd have huge mirrors, I suppose,

370
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,200
 that would be concave, I guess, and they'd focus a ray directly at a point on a ship.

371
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,920
 But you need to focus it at one point for quite a long time.

372
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,920
 The ship is moving.

373
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,420
 The ship is moving around.

374
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,420
 You need to perfectly still there.

375
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,420
 Not if you're being sieged.

376
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,420
 That's a good point.

377
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,720
 If they've tied up the ship.

378
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,200
 Actually, Anna has been tried the death ray with the mirrors and the thing.

379
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,640
 So some students at MIT, I think it was in about 2007 or 2008, they got 127 mirrored

380
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,040
 tiles and an oak replica of a Roman ship, and they proved it was possible.

381
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,040
 Did they?

382
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,040
 They did it.

383
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,040
 Nice.

384
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,040
 Did they put it on the water?

385
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:17,240
 I don't know if they did it, or if they had to hold the ship in exactly the same place

386
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,680
 for six days or whatever.

387
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:22,200
 So it might be untrue, but it still might be possible.

388
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:28,120
 One reason it might be untrue is, like Anna says, it was quite a while after it happened

389
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,400
 that people wrote about it.

390
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:34,760
 Lucy, and I think it was the very first person in 160 AD, but the same story is told of another

391
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:39,160
 person, Proclus of Athens, and usually when the same story is told about two or three

392
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:43,320
 different famous people, usually it means it's probably a madey-upy thingy.

393
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,120
 Do you think the grappling hook happened with the ships?

394
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,120
 I just can't.

395
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,640
 I just can't believe it, even though it's obviously people said it happened, but the

396
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,560
 descriptions are so extraordinary.

397
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:59,720
 So I think in Plutarch's description, he said, "A ship was frequently lifted up to

398
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:05,920
 a great height in the air, a dreadful thing to behold, no ship, and was rolled to and

399
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,640
 fro and kept swinging until all the sailors were thrown out."

400
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,360
 I mean, it sounds like one of those rides at a theme park, actually.

401
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,360
 Yeah.

402
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,360
 You know the...

403
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,360
 All the swinging ship rides.

404
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,360
 Yeah.

405
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,360
 Yeah.

406
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,360
 What theme park are you going to?

407
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,360
 That all of the people inside the bar are being shut down.

408
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,640
 Because before they invented the safety bar.

409
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,640
 Yeah.

410
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:30,600
 Plutarch was writing around 1080, so that was quite a few hundred years later.

411
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:35,160
 And I think whether it happened or not, certainly as you get further away from the supposed

412
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,080
 time, the stories get less and less realistic.

413
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

414
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,520
 Archimedes, there's so many stories about him, though, that's the thing, isn't it?

415
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:47,200
 Like, maybe the thing everyone gets taught is that he shouted Eureka and he jumped out

416
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,440
 of his bath because he discovered the Archimedes principle about displacing water.

417
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,440
 He was weighing, trying to work out how much gold was in the king's crown, wasn't it?

418
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,440
 Right.

419
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,560
 Yeah, he put it in the bath and the amount of water that tipped out told him how dense

420
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,560
 it was.

421
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,560
 Exactly.

422
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,560
 Yeah.

423
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,560
 But he was an incredible mathematician.

424
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:09,000
 You know, he did brilliant work on the surface area of volume of spheres or centres of gravity

425
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,240
 and floating objects.

426
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,840
 And so they're really complicated ideas and it seems unlikely he would have got so excited

427
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,320
 that he would have jumped out of his bath or run out of his naked.

428
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,320
 That's true.

429
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,720
 We know that he didn't like to go in the bath, again, according to Plutax, I'm writing quite

430
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,200
 long down the line, but he was writing, yeah, 200 years later saying this guy was a stinky

431
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,760
 old guy who never took a bath, but he said that his servants used to take him against

432
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,240
 his will to the bath.

433
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:38,000
 And when he was in there, they would put oil on him and instead of washing himself, he

434
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,880
 would draw like mathematical symbols on his body so he could do the maths on his own body.

435
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,400
 It's like when you draw like in the shower, when you kind of write your name on the glass

436
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,400
 of the shower.

437
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,400
 Exactly like that.

438
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,240
 I was thinking of it as a kind of clever way of getting a child to eat his peas.

439
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,240
 That's really clever.

440
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,760
 Cover them with oil so they can write their equations on their chest.

441
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,240
 No, I just sort of mean it's a way of tricking Archimedes into washing himself, basically.

442
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,080
 Well, I'm pretending that he's a black bard.

443
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,080
 Yeah, exactly.

444
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,680
 That gets sort of crafty.

445
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:09,760
 I tried to find out more recent sources about Archimedes, so you know the sites where you

446
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,040
 type in any celebrity's name, basically, and it gives you all the auto-google results.

447
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,040
 Oh, yeah.

448
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,040
 Okay.

449
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,360
 So I've been on who'sdatedwho.com, who is he dating right now?

450
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:22,480
 Apparently, Archimedes is possibly single according to who'sdatedwho.com.

451
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,440
 I went on celebwiki.net measurements, not available.

452
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,440
 Bodybuild average.

453
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,440
 Are these sites...

454
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,440
 And what are they?

455
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,440
 What are these?

456
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,440
 What are you talking about?

457
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,400
 You know, these automatically generated sites that just asset strip from all over the internet

458
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,160
 and they just come up with dubious figures and celebrity net worth or whatever.

459
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,640
 I just thought I'd try it for Archimedes.

460
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,640
 And it turns out he's on all these sites and they know it.

461
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,840
 They don't know anything about him.

462
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,840
 They don't know anything about him.

463
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,840
 They've got it right mostly, haven't they?

464
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:53,320
 Well, it just goes to show, like, if Plutarch found it hard, like, now celebwiki.net is finding

465
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,320
 it even harder to correct.

466
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,520
 Do you think in a thousand years time there'll be a podcast going, "Did you know Archimedes

467
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:04,360
 was of average build and was probably single, according to the sources that were written

468
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,600
 only 2,000 years after he died?"

469
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,600
 Something Syracuse.

470
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,600
 He was in Syracuse, right?

471
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,600
 That's where he's from.

472
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:16,080
 Syracuse had one very, in particular thing in common with the UK today.

473
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,080
 Can you guess what it is?

474
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,400
 It was a services economy rather than goods based.

475
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,400
 No.

476
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,400
 You say the UK?

477
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,400
 The UK, yeah.

478
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,400
 You said the UK, right?

479
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,620
 I mean, you're never going to get this in a billion years.

480
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:33,160
 So, was it about gold?

481
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,040
 It was that they only had one or a remaker.

482
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,040
 Oh my gosh.

483
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:42,960
 So, do you remember a couple of weeks ago we found out there was only one or a remaker

484
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,960
 in the UK?

485
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,960
 Yeah.

486
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:50,720
 Well, there was only one or a remaker in Syracuse and it was Archimedes because he invented

487
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,720
 it.

488
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,960
 But it feels like we've got them on the way up, but he bent them on the way down at that

489
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,960
 end.

490
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,960
 It wasn't in decline then, was it?

491
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,120
 And a thousand years ago, in between those two points, like one in ten people made all

492
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,120
 of these full time.

493
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,120
 Yeah.

494
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,120
 I can't believe we didn't get that chance.

495
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,120
 I feel so stupid.

496
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,920
 It was looking you right in the face on the side.

497
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,920
 Damn it.

498
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,920
 He's such a model for the kind of mad scientist trope, isn't he?

499
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,920
 Yeah.

500
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,920
 Yeah.

501
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,920
 And it must be true.

502
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,320
 I guess all these things must spring from a truth that he was so obsessed with his bloody

503
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,320
 mouth.

504
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,680
 You couldn't even get him in a bath.

505
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,160
 There must have been something to that.

506
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,560
 He was incredible at golf because he could just calculate.

507
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,600
 He could count the number of shots he played.

508
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,600
 Exactly.

509
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,600
 Amazing.

510
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,600
 Yeah.

511
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,880
 He just had one big lever.

512
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,680
 His golf club was one huge lever.

513
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,680
 Every shot was a putt for him.

514
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:41,720
 Do you know you can buy golf clubs where you hold it next to a ball and then it has a little

515
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:46,320
 mechanism inside the club head and it just fires out and shoots out and hits the ball

516
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,520
 exactly the right distance that you want it to go.

517
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,840
 So you don't have to swing it or anything.

518
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,840
 You don't do the swing.

519
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,000
 Just hold it still and it just shoots off.

520
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,120
 Kind of like the alien's jaws in "Alien", you know, where it just open up like...

521
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,120
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

522
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,120
 And what's the point in that?

523
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,120
 Because that doesn't seem to take away some of the playing.

524
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,320
 You're still going to walk.

525
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,400
 You're still going to walk to where the ball is.

526
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,680
 Imagine you're a disabled person who can't swing a golf club, but you still want to play.

527
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,080
 You still want to hit the ball and you want to aim it and stuff like that, but you can't

528
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,080
 swing it.

529
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,080
 Okay.

530
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,080
 So you have to point it right, I guess.

531
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,080
 Oh yeah.

532
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,080
 You've got to point it.

533
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,080
 Yeah.

534
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,680
 He calculated the total number of grains of sand in the universe as could possibly be

535
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,640
 in the universe.

536
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:26,520
 He worked out that it was 10 to the power of 63.

537
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:31,720
 And he worked that out by working out that the entire universe was about two light years

538
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:35,240
 in diameter and he was no one there.

539
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,960
 I mean, he wasn't even in the same ballpark.

540
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,440
 You can't see picturing alien planets that have sand on it.

541
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,560
 So people had been saying that there was an infinite amount of sand and he wanted to prove

542
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,960
 that actually there wasn't an infinite amount of sand.

543
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,200
 There was a finite amount and I could prove that by looking at how big the universe is,

544
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,480
 looking at how big a grain of sand is and working out that there's a maximum that you

545
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,480
 could have.

546
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:03,200
 And he said that that maximum was 10 to the power of 63 but unfortunately he didn't realize

547
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,880
 that he knew that there were five planets but he didn't know that there were an infinite

548
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,680
 number of universes and planets and stuff.

549
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:14,400
 The old all I have to do is look at how big the universe is and that feels like you're

550
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,560
 going to trip up at the level of how big the universe is.

551
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,560
 It's still very impressive.

552
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:22,800
 It was impressive because you had to basically invent new bits of maths to do it because

553
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,720
 they didn't really have big numbers in those days.

554
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:30,040
 You could talk about 10,000 which is myriad, so that was basically the biggest number you

555
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,040
 could say.

556
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,040
 I mean that is really cool.

557
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:36,240
 And then he came up with like a myriad to the power of a myriad which is 10,000 to

558
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,440
 the power of 10,000 and then sort of extrapolated from there.

559
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,800
 So weird the idea of inventing big numbers, like inventing big things, because the biggest

560
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,720
 thing they could think of was 10 meters high, so they invented the idea.

561
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,080
 You can see all the academics getting together and then someone going up to the board and

562
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,080
 revealing a new zero.

563
00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:01,120
 Has anyone considered 10,000 and one?

564
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:08,760
 Okay, it is time for fact number three.

565
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,120
 That is Anna.

566
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:15,760
 My fact this week is that most black swallower fish specimens died because they ate too much

567
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,400
 and their stomachs exploded.

568
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,400
 Wow.

569
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,400
 Weird life trajectory they have.

570
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,640
 It is a lot weird going on in that sense.

571
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,800
 Yeah, so the black swallower fish is a type of fish.

572
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:32,040
 When I say specimens, I mean ones that we found, a specimen is something that a scientist

573
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:36,120
 looks at in researches, so it is not clear that this is how most of them die, it is just

574
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:40,160
 all the ones we have found have floated up to the top of the water because this has happened

575
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:44,520
 and the reason this has happened is because they are amazing at swallowing, sometimes

576
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,520
 too good.

577
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,360
 So they are about 20 centimeters long.

578
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:52,080
 They can swallow prey that is over twice as long as them, I mean one of them was found

579
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:58,120
 with prey four times as long as it is in its body and ten times the mass.

580
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,520
 So if you look up pictures of them, they are just the best.

581
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:04,280
 It looks like they are carrying a huge bit of carry on luggage under their stomach which

582
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,280
 is where they store this food.

583
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,280
 It is amazing.

584
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:13,400
 They look absolutely ridiculous, but sometimes their eyes are too big for their stomachs and

585
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,760
 they will eat something so huge that they cannot digest it quickly enough before it

586
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,760
 starts decomposing.

587
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,480
 And when it starts decomposing, it releases all these gases in their stomachs and they

588
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,480
 inflate and they sort of float to the top like a helium balloon and they explode and

589
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,640
 then that is where we find them.

590
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,640
 Pick them up and go look at this.

591
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,640
 It is amazing.

592
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,160
 It is kind of not surprising these are the only ones we found because they live quite

593
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,160
 deep down don't they?

594
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,160
 Yeah.

595
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,320
 They live in the twilight zone.

596
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,320
 I know, I love it.

597
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,120
 Well they live in the lower twilight and the upper midnight zone.

598
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,120
 There are two different zones.

599
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,320
 Do you think lots of really weird stuff happens down there that they cannot explain?

600
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,320
 I bet.

601
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,480
 I mean these things are really freaky.

602
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,800
 One thing we don't know is how they prey or we are not sure.

603
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,360
 It is basically where they prey forwards or backwards.

604
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,920
 So they have got these teeth which retract, you know like a staged dagger which kind of

605
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,200
 retracts and then pops back out.

606
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:04,080
 So they have got those basically, but they are pointing backwards I think.

607
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,840
 So the prey can push it, it can push prey into its mouth and the prey then finds it incredibly

608
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,600
 hard to get out again, but it can go further in.

609
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,600
 And so we think it either ...

610
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,280
 I think that is a horrible option isn't it, it is like you can't get out darling, but

611
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,640
 don't worry, you can go further in.

612
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,640
 What?

613
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,760
 That is it, they either bite from the tail end of the prey and just work their way up

614
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,240
 to the head or they bite the head and then work their way down.

615
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,920
 Yeah, they have got really sharp teeth don't they?

616
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,360
 Yeah, but maybe they bite something too big and then they just have to keep going.

617
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,080
 Yeah, because not only can the prey not escape, but we think that they can't spit anything

618
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,080
 out because of these teeth.

619
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,960
 They are just locked into this thing, so they have to judge quite carefully how big what

620
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,960
 they are eating is.

621
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,760
 It is like if you go to the buffet and you can only go once, you have to really nail

622
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,760
 it.

623
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,760
 You get the biggest piece of turkey.

624
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,760
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

625
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,240
 It is like you have to finish it, otherwise they won't let you leave.

626
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,720
 And you are like, you have still got five sausage rolls there, and you are like, "Oh,

627
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,880
 no, no, no, I knew it."

628
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:59,160
 The black swallower fish was discovered in 1864 by someone called James Yates Johnson,

629
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:05,640
 and he is possibly more notable or as notable for discovering a lot of other fish and spiders,

630
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:10,280
 but also for donating the moss collection to the Natural History Museum of Madeira.

631
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,280
 Wow.

632
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,800
 So just a little of moss.

633
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,800
 Can I, James?

634
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,800
 Thank you.

635
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,760
 We have a lot of facts at this point in our show from you.

636
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,640
 Andy teed it up back in the day, but it is great.

637
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,680
 I am going to have to hand over the moss trousers at some point.

638
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:26,560
 Jesus Christ, please wash them first.

639
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:30,440
 One cool thing we should say is that their bellies are stretched so thin that they are

640
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,440
 transparent.

641
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,440
 Yeah.

642
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,440
 So you do get a good view.

643
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,400
 It is like having a window into there.

644
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,400
 It is interesting.

645
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,400
 You get quite a few of these animals that can eat whole prey, not just this one.

646
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:44,600
 But most of them, I am not most of them, maybe about a quarter of them have got black guts

647
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:50,160
 inside of their guts, has got like a black layer so that if you eat something which

648
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:54,440
 glows when you eat it, you do not want it to be glowing inside your tummy, otherwise

649
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,040
 all of your enemies are going to be able to come and eat you.

650
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:00,760
 And so they have this black-lined stomach which stops the glow from coming out.

651
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,760
 So cool.

652
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,400
 But the black swallow does not have that, I do not think.

653
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,920
 That would be really weird if you, yeah.

654
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,160
 You could see what Tom was eating.

655
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,160
 Yeah.

656
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,160
 Yeah.

657
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,960
 Do you think it would help us eat more healthily if we walked around and everyone could look

658
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,840
 in your stomach and go, "Oh yeah, three pizzas last night.

659
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,840
 Wow."

660
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,840
 I think it would.

661
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,520
 So we are not allowed clothes in this scenario.

662
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,120
 They have to be transparent.

663
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:23,160
 Just one little transparent window in the middle of your T-shirt.

664
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:27,640
 Oh, like Rihanna's pregnancy outfit where she showed off her tummy.

665
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,640
 Sure.

666
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,640
 Yeah.

667
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,640
 Yeah.

668
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,640
 Come on guys, keep up.

669
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,640
 Did you call her Rihanna?

670
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,840
 Yeah, I really lived into the age, I think, yeah.

671
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,760
 For all I know, that is how she pronounces it but I do not think so.

672
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,880
 Wait, I think she does but only in private.

673
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,800
 It sounds like you said in an e-mail to someone about Hannah.

674
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,800
 Rihanna.

675
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,800
 Rihanna.

676
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:51,280
 What do we think of her clothing choice today?

677
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:55,880
 Not appropriate for the office, I say.

678
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,880
 You know dolphins?

679
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,880
 Yeah.

680
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,400
 You know how they, how do they breathe?

681
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,400
 Through their blow holes.

682
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,400
 Yeah.

683
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,400
 Exactly.

684
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,400
 Exciting news.

685
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,080
 Scientists in New Zealand have found a dolphin that breathed through its mouth.

686
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,080
 Oh yeah.

687
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,080
 Yeah.

688
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,080
 It is called Hector's Dolphin.

689
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:12,160
 It is a species or the sub breed of dolphin and specifically it is not actually the whole

690
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,160
 species.

691
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,720
 It is literally one guy, one dolphin who breathed through his mouth.

692
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,640
 Sorry, is he congested in his blow hole?

693
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:23,720
 They have noticed some weird thing about the way the trachea links up to the blow hole and

694
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:27,360
 how actually he might have been injured or something but anyway he has found a way around

695
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:32,240
 whatever this past injury was or event in his life and now it just goes around like

696
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,040
 a dork breathing through his mouth.

697
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,040
 Wow.

698
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,040
 That is amazing.

699
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,040
 Yeah.

700
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:41,640
 It is like humans and things like belong there like little mermaids.

701
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:46,640
 So other fish that have interesting ways of eating food, one of them is the lancet fish

702
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,560
 and mostly this is good because it is sort of vaguely similar to the black swallower

703
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:56,120
 in that its contents of its stomach are often in completely pristine condition because

704
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,320
 it again eats these huge meals.

705
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,520
 So we think it is often fish that live very deep and don't get meals very often so when

706
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,680
 you do you have got to really eat shed loads.

707
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,680
 It is about seven foot long.

708
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,680
 Whoa.

709
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:10,400
 Yeah, it is huge but it will gorge all these meals and then they just sit in its stomach

710
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:14,740
 for ages but it means that lots of the new species that we discover of fish and squids

711
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:19,560
 and octopus are based on opening up the contents of the stomach and then you just get a bunch

712
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,200
 of new species fall out.

713
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,800
 The other interesting thing about lancet fish is that they don't see each other very often

714
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:30,120
 because they live quite deep down and so when they see another lancet fish they are going

715
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:34,700
 to want to mate with it and they don't want to have problems with genders and stuff like

716
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,700
 that.

717
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:41,080
 So if two lancet fish come together they are hermaphrodites and they can change when they

718
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,080
 meet a new one.

719
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,080
 Do they argue about that?

720
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:47,240
 Well I thought it but you know like when you are walking down a pavement and you are not

721
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,720
 sure to turn left or to turn right because someone is walking towards you, I imagine

722
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,720
 there is a lot of that going on.

723
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,720
 Yeah.

724
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,840
 So what there are some times where they accidentally both change to mate, sorry, sorry, they both

725
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,840
 change to female.

726
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,840
 Oh, sorry, sorry.

727
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,840
 They have a little laugh about it and then move on.

728
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,840
 That is cool.

729
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,840
 Holding off.

730
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,880
 So do you end up just having sex with that person James?

731
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:11,720
 If you are in a remote enough place, it is actually wisest to have sex with that person

732
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,440
 because you might not see someone for days.

733
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,560
 If you are going on a country walk you are going to have sex with two of them.

734
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,280
 I guess it is our responsibility to repopulate the earth.

735
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,280
 What?

736
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,280
 We are in Henley.

737
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:30,860
 I found a pretty weird fish that I want to mention.

738
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:35,440
 Yeah, this is called the Calogono and it is in Lake Malawi in East Africa and it is

739
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,600
 what is known as kind of like a sleeper fish.

740
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:42,320
 It does this thing where it pretends not to be a fish for most of its life and then it

741
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,280
 just comes to life as a fish.

742
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,280
 Exactly.

743
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,160
 It is sort of hanging out with some crabs, sort of pretending to be part of the family,

744
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:52,120
 getting all the info, waiting for the moment to arrest.

745
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:58,720
 No, this is a fish that plays dead basically in order to eat food and it lays down and it

746
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:03,460
 just plays dead and smaller fish will come to either check it out or maybe get a nibble

747
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:09,220
 on it and as they come it suddenly goes, "Wah!" and jumps up, well not jumps but whatever

748
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,220
 fish do.

749
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,220
 Swims.

750
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,780
 Swims up and eats everyone.

751
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:13,780
 Eats all the spectators.

752
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,940
 It is like going to a buffet and you get eaten by the sausage hole.

753
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:17,940
 Exactly.

754
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:22,780
 I am going to slightly off piece of the thing about guts because this is about the black

755
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,220
 swallower and how it eats.

756
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,220
 Yes.

757
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:30,000
 It is hanging out about uses of cow guts.

758
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,120
 Did you know that top flight tennis rackets all used to be made of cow intestines?

759
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,280
 It was used on the strings, wasn't it?

760
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:40,840
 It was the strings but until about ten years ago, as in really recently, there was this

761
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:46,100
 Norfolk film called Bo Brand and I read a few news articles about them and they made

762
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:50,220
 tennis racket strings and harp strings out of cow guts.

763
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:55,040
 I imagine if you accidentally got those mixed up that would be a very melodious game of tennis

764
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:00,160
 and you could turn up with the harp on the court.

765
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,860
 But yeah and I gave them a ring because I thought, "I can't believe this."

766
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,220
 It's true and they said, "Oh yeah, we don't do it anymore."

767
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:11,540
 But until about ten years ago, we did and it took four cows to make one tennis racket.

768
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:17,060
 No, that's too many cows for each, because they use like five tennis rackets per game.

769
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,060
 I know.

770
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:23,100
 And that's why you'll often see around the edge of the court like twenty cows just waiting

771
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,100
 for them to be...

772
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:27,080
 Actual luck on their faces.

773
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,440
 I think you can play on with that racket actually, Roger.

774
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,040
 At least I didn't use silkworm guts.

775
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,040
 Do you remember we talked about that?

776
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,760
 A lot of silkworms.

777
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,840
 Was that just the top-end players or is that every racket?

778
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:42,640
 No, this is top-end and they used to send a team to Wimbledon.

779
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,080
 They would have a little place where they would restring your rackets for you for the

780
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,080
 top players and they would...

781
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,080
 Oh yeah!

782
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,320
 A stable where they'd do that, wasn't it, around the back?

783
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,320
 Yeah.

784
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,820
 That's where they come out bloodstains when they go back onto the courts.

785
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,820
 So they all made...

786
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:58,820
 They're all like plastic though.

787
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,820
 I think they are, yeah.

788
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:00,820
 And they said...

789
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:04,100
 I spoke to a really nice lady at Bo Brand, so thank you to her for talking to me for

790
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,780
 quite a long time actually about this stuff.

791
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:10,380
 And she said that demand really slackened off about ten years ago, but fortunately it coincided

792
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:13,140
 with a huge increase in demand for harps.

793
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:16,500
 No idea why, but basically they just pivoted the business.

794
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:20,820
 Did you ask her like, what happened ten years ago with that harp and then suddenly it played

795
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:21,820
 in the background?

796
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:25,760
 I actually thought about what happened.

797
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:33,160
 The Sloan's Viperfish can eat very big things and it does it by opening its jaw up to over

798
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:37,880
 90 degrees, so it massively opens its mouth and is doing it net right now.

799
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,560
 I think I can go over 90 actually.

800
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:43,120
 Actually, how big do you think your mouth gap is there Anna?

801
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,120
 Would you say...

802
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,120
 At a conference or...

803
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,120
 At a good angle.

804
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,840
 No, no, top to bottom in centimetres.

805
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:56,500
 You'd have to ask Archimedes, essentially it's like 4.5.

806
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,500
 4.5.

807
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:01,820
 The largest mouth gap for any woman in the world is 6.52 centimetres.

808
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:04,840
 So you're getting there, Samantha Ramsdell.

809
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:12,100
 She can bite through four single stacked cheeseburgers in one go and fit an entire large-sized French

810
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,660
 fries from McDonald's in her mouth.

811
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:17,660
 Oh wow, standing up, so she eats fries vertically.

812
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,660
 Is that what you're saying?

813
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:19,660
 Oh, yeah.

814
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:20,660
 I think like you bundle them like straws.

815
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,660
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

816
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,660
 I thought you meant the full thing.

817
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,660
 No, no, no.

818
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,660
 Cheese fries.

819
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,660
 That's a real...

820
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,660
 Cheese fries vertically.

821
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:32,320
 It's some kind of sick burn.

822
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:38,480
 She can be seen on TikTok sometimes with a guy called Isaac Johnson who has the male

823
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,000
 record gape and his is 9.52 centimetres.

824
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 That's big.

825
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 That's big.

826
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 That's big.

827
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,340
 So they're a couple because I want to see them snog.

828
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,340
 Yes.

829
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:51,060
 No one wants to see that, do they?

830
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,060
 Oh my God.

831
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:57,060
 They can snog when they can hold a billiard ball in between their tongues as they're doing.

832
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:04,000
 Isaac can fit objects such as a baseball, a soda can, or a large apple in his mouth.

833
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,260
 Oh, that's really put it in context for me.

834
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:12,400
 I once saw a really big apple at the offices of We Buy Any Card dot com in Haringay.

835
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,540
 I reckon he could fit that in because it was a massive apple.

836
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,380
 Good plan for We Buy Any Card dot com.

837
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:20,980
 I'd like to drill down into this a bit.

838
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:21,980
 Was it on display?

839
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:22,980
 Was it...

840
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:23,980
 I reckon.

841
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:24,980
 You think our cars are good?

842
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:25,980
 Wait till you...

843
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:26,980
 You should have...

844
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:27,980
 Honestly, this apple was so massive.

845
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:30,700
 Dan's got a large coffee cup here.

846
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,460
 I reckon it was as tall as that.

847
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,460
 Oh, that's insane.

848
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:37,320
 All I could do when he was talking to me was look at this apple because it was so massive.

849
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,780
 Were you trying to sell them a car at the time?

850
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:43,200
 I gave them... yeah, I sold them a car, yeah.

851
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,200
 What apple?

852
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,200
 Oh, my God.

853
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,960
 It's Jack and the Beanstalk all over again.

854
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:52,160
 You go home, your agent mother is saying, "Did you manage to sell the car to let us live?"

855
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,400
 No, but I got this big old apple.

856
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,560
 They just say in Jack and the Beanstalk, right, the moral of that story is that you

857
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:03,200
 should sell your cow for beans because he gets the beans and he gets a massive beanstalk

858
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,560
 and then he gets a golden chicken or something, doesn't he?

859
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,560
 And how much of that?

860
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,560
 A golden chicken?

861
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,560
 A golden chicken.

862
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,560
 You've misread that story.

863
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,600
 Does he not get a golden head or something?

864
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,600
 A golden goose?

865
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,600
 Yeah.

866
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,600
 Does he get a golden goose at the time?

867
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,600
 Yeah, but then he steals it from the time.

868
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,260
 He chimes down the Beanstalk after it, but then he has to cut the Beanstalk down and

869
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:19,260
 then...

870
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,260
 He does all that.

871
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:23,840
 Like, basically, he's taken a risk at the very start of that story, you know, selling

872
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,540
 his car or whatever it was for some beans.

873
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:30,040
 And then he's had to go through a few troubles, but at the end he gets a golden goose that

874
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,040
 lays golden eggs.

875
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,520
 So the moral of the story is do something stupid.

876
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,560
 At the end, it'll work out fine.

877
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,260
 Are you trying to justify giving away your car for an apple?

878
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:40,760
 Because it feels like you are.

879
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,760
 How much?

880
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,760
 It's a big apple.

881
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,760
 It's not any old apple.

882
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,720
 Look, my wife didn't buy this and you guys aren't buying it either.

883
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:56,640
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show, and that is my fact.

884
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:01,640
 My fact this week is that there is a cathedral in Norway currently restoring its rooftop with

885
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:07,520
 large amounts of urine from a retired field horse called Norik.

886
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:11,360
 Norik likes to pee into a bucket at specific times every single day.

887
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,360
 Wow.

888
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,360
 So...

889
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,360
 A lot to unpack there.

890
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,360
 A lot to unpack here with this story.

891
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:18,560
 I should just quickly say I got sent this story by a friend of mine, Riggs, who lives

892
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,560
 in Norway.

893
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:23,000
 She spotted it and it was a calling out for horse urine.

894
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,960
 So the story is basically that there is a very old cathedral there.

895
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,960
 It's called Niderås Cathedral.

896
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,000
 It's in Trondheim, and the idea is that they're doing the roof at the moment, but the problem

897
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 is that in order to get the roof back to the state that they want to get it to, they need

898
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,480
 to oxidize the copper.

899
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:42,120
 And in order to do that, it's been discovered that you can use horse urine or cow urine.

900
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:46,800
 So to oxidize the copper, you mean like it goes from the shiny color to like a green

901
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,800
 color?

902
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,800
 Exactly.

903
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,400
 So if you know a green color on a cathedral roof, that is the state that it needs to be

904
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,880
 in, but it takes a long time to do that and it can take decades in fact.

905
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:59,520
 But by using horse urine, they are able to speed up the process.

906
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,120
 The issue is where do you get that much horse urine?

907
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,120
 From a horse.

908
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,120
 From a horse, right?

909
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,160
 But, you know, who's going to give you that urine?

910
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:10,680
 You need to do a calling out to the world, or specifically to that very tiny bit of Norway.

911
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,800
 And so that's what they did.

912
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,840
 The people said, "Do you have horse urine?

913
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,840
 We need it."

914
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:19,280
 And this was spotted by someone who has a very old horse called Norik, who has this very

915
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:25,320
 curious thing, which is that Norik likes to pee at certain times indoors every day.

916
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,080
 And so what they do is they bring Norik in.

917
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:32,520
 He comes for his daily pee at a certain time and he's been supplying sort of most of the

918
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,520
 pee.

919
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,520
 Amazing.

920
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,520
 Okay.

921
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,520
 They sent it on Facebook, didn't they?

922
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,520
 Yeah.

923
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:42,880
 It's on a group called "It Happens in Bin Niset," which I think is a town near Trondheim.

924
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,880
 And they said, "Hello.

925
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:47,640
 A somewhat special request, but we would love to get our hands on about four to five liters

926
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,560
 of horse urine.

927
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:54,920
 If you have an opportunity to help with this, feel free to contact Henning Grott, stone cutter

928
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,920
 at the cathedral.

929
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,760
 I'm interested that they collect it in a bucket, because that does imply that someone's

930
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,280
 wasting there all the time, because you don't know when a horse is going to weep.

931
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,280
 You just go into the stable and they've done it all over the hay.

932
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,280
 But this is the point, though.

933
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,280
 So it chooses.

934
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,280
 And does it over the bucket?

935
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,280
 Yeah.

936
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,280
 Yeah.

937
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,280
 I mean, there's actually a video that you can see online.

938
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,640
 So Norik is about to take a pee.

939
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:16,040
 It's basically just a shot of his penis in camera and then the urine starts coming out.

940
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,320
 A bucket comes underneath it and starts collecting.

941
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,320
 Yeah.

942
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:22,320
 So actually there's a stable hand who has to sit in the stable all day, every day, until

943
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,760
 he starts peeing and then shove the bucket underneath his wooly.

944
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,440
 This is how you got a urine sample from a horse.

945
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:31,320
 I was looking up how you do it and I was on the website horsesidevetguide.com and it

946
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:34,360
 said what you do is you get a disposable coffee cup.

947
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:38,360
 So Dan's got a disposable coffee cup here and you attach that to a broom handle and

948
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:41,880
 then you wait for the horse to start peeing and then you just move it slowly into position

949
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,240
 and then you catch the midstream urine, which is the good stuff if you're testing horses

950
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,240
 healthy.

951
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,840
 If you want to at home picture how big my cup is, by the way, it's roughly the same size

952
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:50,840
 as a beer.

953
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,040
 Well, like a few jettles.

954
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,040
 That's just for the listener.

955
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:57,820
 An apple that I would say would be worth a car.

956
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:02,640
 There's a few different ways that they could have done this instead of putting horse urine

957
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,000
 on the roof.

958
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:11,080
 They could have covered it in hard boiled eggs and that would have done the job.

959
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:14,920
 They could have used Miracle Grow Plant Fertiliser.

960
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:15,920
 I've got some of that.

961
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,160
 Well, you can use that to oxidise your copper.

962
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,160
 Oh, great.

963
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,160
 Is that what is that?

964
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,160
 Because of nitrogen?

965
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,920
 It's the ammonia we think in the urine, isn't it?

966
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:24,920
 Yes.

967
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,280
 So in the urine, it's ammonia.

968
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:31,280
 Now urine doesn't have any ammonia in it, but it does contain things that bacteria like

969
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,480
 and you have bacteria in the air.

970
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,520
 So that bacteria goes into the urine and then the bacteria creates ammonia.

971
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,720
 So you couldn't use just fresh out of the horse urine.

972
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,760
 You need to leave it to stand for a bit.

973
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,720
 But sulfur also works and that's what you get with your hard boiled eggs.

974
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,760
 That's so clever.

975
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,760
 It would stink, though.

976
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:51,280
 You've smeared egg soul for all over your church roof.

977
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,920
 Well, more than horse piss?

978
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,360
 Yeah, actually, that causes differences.

979
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:59,760
 Another one you could do would be salt and vinegar crisps, apparently.

980
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:06,240
 That is apparently an age-old, can't be that old, but it's a way of doing this that you

981
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,240
 see on there.

982
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:10,440
 That's how they did Westminster Abbey originally.

983
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:16,400
 Just back to this idea about Norric going in at certain times and peeing into the bucket.

984
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,720
 I was reading a blog the other day and it actually has this really interesting thing,

985
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:23,200
 which is that horses can be taught to pee on command.

986
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,200
 They can be toilet-trained.

987
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,200
 They can be toilet-trained.

988
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,200
 Really?

989
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,840
 But what about that old saying, you can take a horse to the toilet, but you can't make

990
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:29,840
 it piss?

991
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:30,840
 Yes.

992
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:35,560
 Well, in the article that I was reading, it did sort of say that what it's useful really

993
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,280
 is, you know, horse shows.

994
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:42,080
 If a horse is going out into the ring and it's about to do an act, you don't want your horse

995
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,560
 shitting and pissing everywhere, do you?

996
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:49,120
 And so if you can get your horse to go beforehand by teaching it when to go, you're fine.

997
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:54,640
 What you need to do is, when you see a horse pissing, quickly go up beside it and just

998
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,640
 start whistling.

999
00:45:55,640 --> 00:46:01,400
 Just go whistling and whistle to the exact length of their pee.

1000
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:05,640
 Now, obviously, you might not have that much breath, so catch your breath back into the

1001
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:06,640
 whistle.

1002
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,640
 Yeah, no, no.

1003
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,280
 I know what whistle sounds like.

1004
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,280
 Great.

1005
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,280
 So you've done that.

1006
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,280
 Go away.

1007
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:13,280
 You're seeing the horse pee again later.

1008
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,760
 Go back quickly to its side as it's peeing.

1009
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:22,000
 Do this for weeks and weeks and weeks, and then after weeks, you'll find that when you

1010
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:28,160
 go near a horse that probably needs a pee and you go, it goes the other way around.

1011
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,160
 The horse starts peeing to your whistle.

1012
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,160
 Amazing.

1013
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:35,040
 It's suddenly you're enabling the piss via your whistle.

1014
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,120
 It's not much of a superpower, is it?

1015
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:41,160
 It's making any horse piss on demand.

1016
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,520
 And you get therapy horses, though, don't you?

1017
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,720
 Or guide horses.

1018
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:49,520
 Some blind people who are allergic to dogs have to have guide ponies, you remember?

1019
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:50,520
 Just a small pony.

1020
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:51,520
 Shetland.

1021
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,520
 Yeah, yeah.

1022
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:53,520
 Like a little Shetland pony.

1023
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,520
 Shire horse.

1024
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,520
 Yeah.

1025
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,480
 I mean, I haven't been on the London Underground when a horse comes on the carriage.

1026
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,480
 No.

1027
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:00,480
 But that is a thing.

1028
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,400
 I guess they have to have some kind of training system.

1029
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,400
 Yeah.

1030
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,400
 Well, you can pee.

1031
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,400
 I mean.

1032
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,400
 Well, there are nappies as well.

1033
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,400
 You can get a horse nappies.

1034
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:10,400
 You said that as if it was a really standard piece of information.

1035
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,400
 It was.

1036
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,400
 So who wears the nappies?

1037
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,400
 The guide horses?

1038
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,400
 Yeah.

1039
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,400
 Or horses that are, you know, doing, I guess, presentations.

1040
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,400
 I mean, that's worse.

1041
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:25,880
 In dressage, you'd rather the horse just weed than you've got some huge nappy.

1042
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:31,440
 Rodin used urine on his sculptures, not horse urine, but he used to instruct his assistants

1043
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:36,600
 to go out into his, like, outdoor studio and urinate all over the bronze statues in the

1044
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:37,600
 yard.

1045
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:38,600
 Oh, bronzes.

1046
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:39,600
 I was thinking stone.

1047
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:40,600
 But okay.

1048
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:41,600
 Bronzes.

1049
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,100
 He didn't piss on the kiss.

1050
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:46,440
 Sadly not.

1051
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,840
 So actually, he just got his helpers to pee on it.

1052
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,120
 He didn't collect them or anything.

1053
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,760
 He just said go and piss on them.

1054
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:52,760
 It's a studio, isn't it?

1055
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:53,760
 It's like Damien Hurst.

1056
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,000
 Damien Hurst often won't piss on his own stuff.

1057
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
 Will he not?

1058
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
 No.

1059
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,440
 Yeah, don't piss on your own stuff.

1060
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,320
 Save that for the critics.

1061
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:05,320
 Well, Vincent van Gogh also used cow urine.

1062
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:08,520
 This color called Indian yellow, which was this huge secret and it came in these balls

1063
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:12,160
 and it was really popular in the 19th century because it's an unbelievably vivid dye and

1064
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:16,840
 no one knows how it was made and it was this huge secret and it turns out that this village

1065
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:21,200
 in India called Mirazapur was taking its cows and it was restricting their diet, basically

1066
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,800
 only to mango leaves.

1067
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,800
 Oh, yeah.

1068
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,800
 And there are some claims and counterclaims about it, but there's pretty good evidence

1069
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:31,160
 that it did happen and they would take the cow's piss and they would heat it and they'd

1070
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:35,520
 bake it down to a syrup, basically, dry the syrup so it's ultra pure.

1071
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,080
 And The Starry Night by Vincent van Gogh.

1072
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:39,080
 Cow piss.

1073
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,960
 You'll see in cow piss when you see those stars, yeah.

1074
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:41,960
 No way.

1075
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:42,960
 You should go and stand.

1076
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:43,960
 What gallery is it in?

1077
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:46,120
 I want someone to go and stand there and just tell everyone who comes and starts admiring

1078
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,120
 it.

1079
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:50,120
 Cow piss, you know?

1080
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,120
 Cow piss.

1081
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:53,560
 You can use horse urine to grow pineapples.

1082
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:54,560
 Really?

1083
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:58,840
 Which they do at the Lost Gardens of Heligan, which is in Cornwall.

1084
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:03,000
 And they still make pineapples in that old way that they used to.

1085
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,080
 So, do you remember how we said that you used to be able to buy a pineapple for the same

1086
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,080
 price as a car?

1087
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:10,920
 Now, I know what you're going to say.

1088
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:11,920
 You got confused.

1089
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,420
 You thought it was a pineapple.

1090
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:19,120
 Well, when you saw this really big apple devs, was it spiky and didn't have, like, green

1091
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:20,120
 spines?

1092
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:23,520
 It was an open brackets pine, closed brackets apple.

1093
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,520
 No.

1094
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:28,360
 So, like, pineapples used to be really expensive because they were so expensive to grow in

1095
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,840
 the UK because we don't have the climate.

1096
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:36,000
 And so, the Lost Gardens of Heligan in Cornwall still make them in the old-fashioned way.

1097
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,800
 And the way that they do that is they get a greenhouse, but they heat up the greenhouse

1098
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:46,200
 by putting horse manure and horse urine and piles of straw in the corner, and they kind

1099
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:50,700
 of, like, a compost heat will get hotter and hotter, and that heats up the building hot.

1100
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:54,480
 But it does mean every pineapple costs £1,200 to grow.

1101
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,480
 That's a lot.

1102
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,680
 So, it's a lot of money for one pineapple, isn't it?

1103
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:58,680
 Yeah.

1104
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:03,360
 I reckon that the pineapple that they're growing at the moment, or might have just grown,

1105
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:08,520
 is going to be worth around £10,000 in total because of not just how much it costs to make,

1106
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:11,480
 but also its rarity and stuff like that.

1107
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:14,080
 But even though it's worth that much, they're not going to sell it, they're going to cut

1108
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,960
 it up and feed it to their staff.

1109
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:16,960
 Nice.

1110
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:17,960
 Wow.

1111
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:18,960
 It's quite nice, isn't it?

1112
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,760
 I did read that when they started doing this, they gave the second one they'd grown to the

1113
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:23,760
 Queen.

1114
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:24,760
 I guess great.

1115
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,840
 But they did make sure that they'd tasted the first one to ensure that they did not

1116
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:29,880
 taste of horse urine in horse manure.

1117
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:30,880
 Good idea.

1118
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,600
 That is a risk.

1119
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:38,320
 On urine collection, the first ever people doing IVF, so very early patients.

1120
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,880
 This was, when was it, 70s, I think?

1121
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,840
 Well, Louise Brown was 77, I think.

1122
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:43,840
 Oh, OK.

1123
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:44,840
 Yeah, yeah.

1124
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:48,600
 So, the two doctors who were pioneering it really were called Robert Edwards and Patrick

1125
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:53,480
 Steptoe, and it was really old Steptoe, and it's quite controversial.

1126
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:57,120
 You know, there were a few various kinds, because it was kind of creating life artificially.

1127
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:01,560
 But early patients had to live in the centre, basically, for two or three weeks as inpatients

1128
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:06,760
 while this was going on, and they had to collect all of their urine during treatment, because

1129
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:08,880
 they needed to monitor their hormone levels.

1130
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:12,640
 So they just had to carry these huge plastic containers every time they went offsite.

1131
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:16,280
 They did have an amazing pineapple garden rum bag.

1132
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:19,320
 Yeah, it was really, it was really basic stuff.

1133
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:23,320
 And the other thing they had to do was, after your embryos were inserted back into you,

1134
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:26,440
 the women had to spend an hour or two crouching down with their bottoms in the air, just in

1135
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:28,720
 case, in case gravity helped.

1136
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,520
 They weren't sure whether it helped or not.

1137
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:31,680
 Wasn't it the case, by the way?

1138
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,800
 I actually don't have any information on this, but I remember reading that in the early

1139
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:39,200
 days of penicillin, we didn't have enough penicillin itself to go around for every patient.

1140
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:43,120
 So what they would do is, they would give a patient some of the penicillin and then wait

1141
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:47,040
 at the other end of them for it to come out through their pee, and they would extract the

1142
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,320
 remaining penicillin that was in there, and then give that to another patient.

1143
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:54,080
 Because you would have thought that you have metabolised the useful bits of the penicillin.

1144
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,080
 Oh, yeah, that's the point.

1145
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:56,080
 It's diluting, and diluting, and diluting.

1146
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:59,440
 But I guess you've maybe got enough left over in it that it's worth extracting from

1147
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,440
 the pee.

1148
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:02,240
 That's really gross.

1149
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:08,480
 I was reading an article which said that action must be taken over the surprisingly widespread

1150
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:12,680
 problem of stable staff urinating into race horses' bedding.

1151
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:15,080
 I saw that.

1152
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,080
 Did you?

1153
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:17,080
 Yeah.

1154
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,080
 And what's the problem?

1155
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:21,720
 Oh, it's just horrible for the horses, because they've got a bed covered in groom piss.

1156
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:24,680
 Well, the last problem, the problem is the testing.

1157
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:25,680
 No, it is a problem.

1158
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:26,680
 It's bad for the horses.

1159
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:31,440
 You don't want to lie them down on sort of wet, damp hay or straw.

1160
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,960
 Horses sleep on their urine a lot.

1161
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:33,960
 They should be mucked out.

1162
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,120
 They should be, you know.

1163
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:37,960
 But when you muck out the horses, hey, you're going to muck out the human urine with the

1164
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,080
 horse urine, aren't you?

1165
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:43,680
 I also think, though, if I, you know, got the bed, ever wet the bed, I don't want other

1166
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:46,920
 people coming pissing on my bed going, "Well, you've already done it, so I might as well

1167
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:47,920
 as well."

1168
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:48,920
 Exactly.

1169
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:49,920
 Do you think it's, well, it probably is worse.

1170
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,920
 Like, your own fart smell okay, but someone else is already horrible.

1171
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:57,040
 And it's like, it'd be less, "I don't really want to sleep on my own wet bed, but I would

1172
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:01,560
 rather do that if it was a choice between that and the bed that Andy's pissed in."

1173
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:02,560
 Thank you.

1174
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:03,560
 Sure.

1175
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:04,560
 Yeah.

1176
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,560
 Great.

1177
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:06,560
 Exactly.

1178
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:07,560
 Yeah.

1179
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:08,560
 No, I thought they were saying it was for the horse's benefit, but you're saying it's

1180
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,240
 also for the problem of doping.

1181
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,240
 The reason it came up.

1182
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:13,240
 Because grooms are all coked off their heads.

1183
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:15,800
 The reason it came up is because the grooms are all coked off their heads.

1184
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,320
 But they don't test the straw.

1185
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:18,320
 Yeah, they do.

1186
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,320
 What?

1187
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:20,320
 They test the straw?

1188
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:23,160
 You'll do the testing by testing the horse's straw, because that's where you get the horse

1189
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,160
 ear and fork.

1190
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,560
 So the bedding will get tested as a sample.

1191
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:29,440
 And there's a trainer whose horse was found to have been sort of doping, but I think with

1192
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:32,600
 something that you wouldn't dop with like marijuana or something, I can't remember

1193
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:33,600
 actually what it was.

1194
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:34,600
 Right.

1195
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:38,720
 But it turned out to be caused by the stable staff urinating in the box while he was mucking

1196
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:39,720
 it out.

1197
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:41,560
 This horse has been asking a lot of big questions about the universe.

1198
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:44,600
 They seem to have a lot of jazz, I don't know.

1199
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:51,680
 OK, that's it.

1200
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:52,680
 That's all of our facts.

1201
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,080
