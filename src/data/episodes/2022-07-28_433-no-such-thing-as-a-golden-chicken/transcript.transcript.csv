00:00:00,00:00:05,"Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish. Hope you're all"
00:00:05,00:00:10,very well. I have a little bit of news here and it is of particular interest to people
00:00:10,00:00:17,in the UK and of particular interest to people who love our mother ship of the TV show QI.
00:00:17,00:00:22,"Now you all know QI, it's facts, it's funny, it's just like fish but it's been going for"
00:00:22,00:00:32,a full 20 years and the big news is that all 20 series of QI are now available on BBC iPlayer.
00:00:32,00:00:36,"So as you probably know, each series of QI is represented by a letter of the alphabet"
00:00:36,00:00:43,"and so you can go back and watch facts about astronomy, about bees, about campanology, about"
00:00:43,00:00:49,"dog, well you get the idea. It's 20 series of QI, so many facts, so many amazing moments"
00:00:49,00:00:54,from over the years and it is all as I said available on BBC iPlayer. And of course it
00:00:54,00:00:58,wouldn't be a top of the show announcement if I didn't remind you all that we are going
00:00:58,00:01:03,"back on the road in autumn, if you live in Scotland or in Wales or indeed I think we"
00:01:03,00:01:10,have one show coming up also in London then do go to qi.com/fishevents and get your tickets
00:01:10,00:01:14,fast because I know for a fact that some of those dates are just on the verge of selling
00:01:14,00:01:19,"out. Anyway, before you go to iPlayer to binge on all the episodes of QI, we better get on"
00:01:19,00:01:31,with this week's show so on with the podcast!
00:01:31,00:01:42,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:01:42,00:01:47,"to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here"
00:01:47,00:01:52,"with James Harkin, Anna Tyshinski and Andrew Hunter Murray and once again we have gathered"
00:01:52,00:01:57,round the microphones with our four favourite facts from the last seven days and in no particular
00:01:57,00:02:03,"order here we go. Starting with fact number one, that is Andy."
00:02:03,00:02:10,My fact is that in 1944 the book The Great Gatsby sold 120 copies. In 1945 the number
00:02:10,00:02:21,"of copies printed was 155,000! I didn't realise how I was going to deliver it until I got"
00:02:21,00:02:27,"towards the end and I thought 'I've just said 120, why not say 155?' Anyway, great behind"
00:02:27,00:02:32,the scenes. We've got to show how the sausage is made.
00:02:32,00:02:36,So The Great Gatsby by F Scott Fitzgerald was a book that was quite popular at first
00:02:36,00:02:42,and then it really tailed off. By 1944 pretty much no one was buying it and it was practically
00:02:42,00:02:47,out of print. So then in the Second World War though there was this mad scheme that was
00:02:47,00:02:52,run by a load of American publishing titans. They clubbed together and they formed this
00:02:52,00:02:56,thing called the Council on Books in Wartime and they decided that they wanted to print
00:02:56,00:03:02,and sell millions of books to the army. So the army bought the books and then those books
00:03:02,00:03:08,were distributed free to the soldiers and they were made incredibly cheap and 122 million
00:03:08,00:03:13,books were given away to soldiers. And it basically created the paperback book market
00:03:13,00:03:15,in America. They weren't really popular.
00:03:15,00:03:18,And they were to fit in the pocket weren't they?
00:03:18,00:03:19,Yeah.
00:03:19,00:03:21,Which is why Gatsby is good because it's unbelievably short.
00:03:21,00:03:22,It is.
00:03:22,00:03:26,"Yeah, but if you were shot and it like went plowed straight through your copy of The Great"
00:03:26,00:03:27,Gatsby.
00:03:27,00:03:29,You'd rather have Alar as Sherch the Tom Perdue though.
00:03:29,00:03:34,"You know, like one volume on each breath, two on your back."
00:03:34,00:03:37,"Go on, where are the other three going?"
00:03:37,00:03:40,One over the genitals and one on either side of the head.
00:03:40,00:03:42,Maybe two over the genitals.
00:03:42,00:03:44,So he died in 1940.
00:03:44,00:03:45,Fitzgerald.
00:03:45,00:03:50,"Yeah, Fitzgerald died in 1940. The book was originally published in 1925. He didn't achieve"
00:03:50,00:03:55,any success in his life much to the point of like we all know that book and his name
00:03:55,00:03:58,now. Was this the moment that made him a global writer?
00:03:58,00:03:59,"Yeah, pretty much."
00:03:59,00:04:04,He was very famous as a literary figure in the early 20s for his first couple of books
00:04:04,00:04:08,or book. It was beautiful in the damned wasn't it that he wrote which did very well and he
00:04:08,00:04:11,was a famous figure on the literary scene. He made a good amount of money. But it was
00:04:11,00:04:17,just that Gatsby when it came out in the early 20s was quite well received by some people
00:04:17,00:04:18,and not by others.
00:04:18,00:04:19,Yeah.
00:04:19,00:04:20,It was just like when a book comes out.
00:04:20,00:04:21,He thought it was brilliant.
00:04:21,00:04:22,He thought it was like the Great American level.
00:04:22,00:04:24,His review was a five star.
00:04:24,00:04:25,Yeah.
00:04:25,00:04:28,But it was only after the war that it became accepted that it was the Great American level.
00:04:28,00:04:29,Exactly.
00:04:29,00:04:30,Yeah.
00:04:30,00:04:33,Like so from these days it sells about half a million copies every year compared with
00:04:33,00:04:37,a hundred and twenty copies just you know a few years after his death. I mean it was
00:04:37,00:04:38,it was no way.
00:04:38,00:04:40,So this year it sold about five hundred.
00:04:40,00:04:41,Thousand!
00:04:41,00:04:42,Exactly.
00:04:42,00:04:43,Cool.
00:04:43,00:04:46,I didn't see where you were going with that.
00:04:46,00:04:47,Yeah.
00:04:47,00:04:49,Like I said these books came to fit in your pocket right?
00:04:49,00:04:50,Yeah.
00:04:50,00:04:54,There was two different sizes. One to fit in your shirt pocket. One to fit in your pants.
00:04:54,00:04:57,They were quite flimsy. They cost six cents each to make.
00:04:57,00:04:58,Yeah.
00:04:58,00:05:03,So you can still get hold of them today and Andy seeing us today is your publication day
00:05:03,00:05:04,for your novel.
00:05:04,00:05:05,Oh.
00:05:05,00:05:06,I brought you a gift.
00:05:06,00:05:07,OMG.
00:05:07,00:05:10,And that is one of these books.
00:05:10,00:05:11,Oh my God.
00:05:11,00:05:12,Rumble rumble rumble.
00:05:12,00:05:13,Which one is it?
00:05:13,00:05:18,Well I couldn't get hold of the Great Gatsby unfortunately but this is the selected plays
00:05:18,00:05:19,of Eugene O'Neill.
00:05:19,00:05:20,Oh my God.
00:05:20,00:05:23,But it is genuinely one of the ones that was given to the armed services.
00:05:23,00:05:24,Oh that is so cool.
00:05:24,00:05:25,Wow.
00:05:25,00:05:26,Thank you.
00:05:26,00:05:27,So take it out. Let's see the flimsiness of it.
00:05:27,00:05:28,This is so cool.
00:05:28,00:05:31,They were kind of printed in landscape.
00:05:31,00:05:32,Yeah.
00:05:32,00:05:33,Yeah.
00:05:33,00:05:34,And they would have two columns.
00:05:34,00:05:35,I'm seeing that right now and it's shocking to see.
00:05:35,00:05:36,"Sorry, go on."
00:05:36,00:05:37,"Way broader than it is, too."
00:05:37,00:05:42,But they would have two columns on each page so you get more in than a normal book in
00:05:42,00:05:43,quite a small amount.
00:05:43,00:05:44,That's so cool.
00:05:44,00:05:45,Oh thank you James.
00:05:45,00:05:46,That's awesome.
00:05:46,00:05:50,And it says overseas edition for the armed forces distributed by blah blah blah published
00:05:50,00:05:52,by Editions for the Armed Services.
00:05:52,00:05:57,So another place that owns these books is the University of Texas which has about 1400
00:05:57,00:05:58,books.
00:05:58,00:06:01,"And because they were printed on magazine presses, so they were very, they really worked"
00:06:01,00:06:02,out.
00:06:02,00:06:06,And they sort of printed them like a magazine and then they just sliced it in half.
00:06:06,00:06:10,"So the University of Texas ones, they're really brittle and brown these days because"
00:06:10,00:06:14,you know the paper was not designed to last for 80 years and they're kept in I think
00:06:14,00:06:20,"called tuxedo cases, which is described as an acid-free enclosure to keep them pristine."
00:06:20,00:06:23,"I have looked, it just looks like they're in a box."
00:06:23,00:06:26,Do most boxes have lots of acid in them?
00:06:26,00:06:30,"I don't have my boxes specified there, acid-free, does that mean they're full of acid?"
00:06:30,00:06:32,Unfortunately librarians kept putting them in with the acid.
00:06:32,00:06:36,There's big acid vats they have in libraries.
00:06:36,00:06:41,"So comic books were quite popular, Terry and the Pirates was one of the ones that was quite"
00:06:41,00:06:47,popular by a cartoonist called Milton Caniff and the ones that he did for the military
00:06:47,00:06:53,"contained, and this is a quote, ""Damsels as breasty and near nude as Caniff dared draw"
00:06:53,00:06:54,"them."""
00:06:54,00:06:55,Wow.
00:06:55,00:06:59,"So he took his quite like normal comic strip and thought, well this is for the soldiers,"
00:06:59,00:07:01,so I'm going to add boobs.
00:07:01,00:07:02,Nice.
00:07:02,00:07:09,"Speaking of comic books and associated culture, the video game Legend of Zelda, we probably"
00:07:09,00:07:13,"remember playing as children, or adults maybe?"
00:07:13,00:07:15,I bought one recently actually.
00:07:15,00:07:19,That's absolutely fine and no judgement here.
00:07:19,00:07:22,"It was named after Zelda Fitzgerald, Scott's wife."
00:07:22,00:07:23,I don't know that.
00:07:23,00:07:27,"Although who else might it be named after, it's not a very common name, is it, Zelda?"
00:07:27,00:07:30,"She was named after two random other people from books, wasn't she?"
00:07:30,00:07:32,"She was named after someone from a book, wasn't she?"
00:07:32,00:07:35,"Yeah, I think her mum found two references to Zelda."
00:07:35,00:07:39,"Hang on, was it like, oh it wasn't like someone called Zelina and someone called Darth?"
00:07:39,00:07:40,No.
00:07:40,00:07:45,"Fitzgerald, just as his career, I didn't realise that he had a bit of a moment."
00:07:45,00:07:49,"A moment in Hollywood, you know, potentially he was going to be one of the biggest Hollywood"
00:07:49,00:07:53,"script writers, but he just didn't quite get the break that he needed, and he was part"
00:07:53,00:07:58,"of this group that were called the legions of jerks, and that was a name given to them"
00:07:58,00:08:03,"by Jack Warner, and it was quite an amazing pack of writers that were working for Hollywood"
00:08:03,00:08:05,"in that time, in that sort of underneath that name."
00:08:05,00:08:10,"So you had Aldous Huxley, you had Anthony Powell, you had Dorothy Parker."
00:08:10,00:08:13,"It's basically the Algonquin group, really, sounds like."
00:08:13,00:08:17,"So interesting, yeah, but they were all there trying to pump out scripts, and like Fitzgerald"
00:08:17,00:08:21,"was brought on, I don't think they used any of his work for it, but he did a week on"
00:08:21,00:08:22,Gone With The Wind.
00:08:22,00:08:23,It didn't.
00:08:23,00:08:24,"Yeah, like, it's sort of."
00:08:24,00:08:27,Didn't he go there because Zelda had got sick and he needed to make some money or something?
00:08:27,00:08:28,"Yes, so he was really, yeah."
00:08:28,00:08:32,"He was going through a bad patch, there's a lot of rumours that he was an alcoholic in"
00:08:32,00:08:37,"this period, and he was, he had a lot of alcoholic problems, but I think in this specific moment"
00:08:37,00:08:41,"with Hollywood, he was actually quite productive, and he was off the alcohol, he was drinking"
00:08:41,00:08:46,"cases of Coca-Cola, apparently, to sort of, you know, replace one addiction with another,"
00:08:46,00:08:48,just distract himself.
00:08:48,00:08:53,"And he produced a lot of work, and there's something like 2000 pages in an archive sitting"
00:08:53,00:08:59,"somewhere of screenplays, of doctored scripts that he did, but virtually none of them, except"
00:08:59,00:09:02,I think one credit he has properly for a movie.
00:09:02,00:09:06,"He wasn't very, like, he only wrote a few novels, and there were a few batches of short"
00:09:06,00:09:09,"stories, and I don't know, the whole thing seems to have gone off a bit half-cocked his"
00:09:09,00:09:13,"life, you know, it just wasn't very, he joined the army hoping to die, I didn't know this"
00:09:13,00:09:18,"in the First World War, so he'd been rejected by a woman called Genevra, and again, weird,"
00:09:18,00:09:23,"weird name, Genevra de Zelda, anyway, he'd been rejected by her, she'd said, ""no, absolutely"
00:09:23,00:09:24,"not."""
00:09:24,00:09:30,"I think she was extremely wealthy, and he was extremely not wealthy, and so he joined the"
00:09:30,00:09:37,"army hoping to die, trained under Dwight Eisenhower, and then he quickly wrote a 120,000 word"
00:09:37,00:09:41,"novel in the hope that it would sell before he died, and then, anyway, the war ended,"
00:09:41,00:09:46,"so he was fine, because the period where you were American and then being trained and then"
00:09:46,00:09:50,definitely getting to the war was quite a narrow window because of how late America joined
00:09:50,00:09:51,"the First World War, so."
00:09:51,00:09:54,"Quite impressive to quickly write 120,000 word novel, you've just written enough for"
00:09:54,00:09:55,Andy.
00:09:55,00:09:59,Do you think you could have spaffed that out in terms between army service?
00:09:59,00:10:04,"Spaffed out is a funny way of putting a heart and soul into something, but..."
00:10:04,00:10:07,"Well, there was an interesting thing about that, wasn't there, because later on it took"
00:10:07,00:10:12,"him a bit longer to write the novels, he couldn't just spaff them out, but when Zelda got sick"
00:10:12,00:10:17,"because she had mental problems, right, mental issues, and he was kind of looking after her"
00:10:17,00:10:20,"and going to Hollywood and doing all this stuff, and so it took even longer for him"
00:10:20,00:10:25,"to write his novel, and at the same time, Zelda decided to write a novel called Save"
00:10:25,00:10:30,"Me the Waltz, which he thought used all of his material, and what had actually done,"
00:10:30,00:10:34,"it was about their life, right, so who it belongs to, it belongs to whoever writes it"
00:10:34,00:10:38,"first, but he was really annoyed because it had taken him ages to do it, but she managed"
00:10:38,00:10:40,to write her novel in three months.
00:10:40,00:10:41,Wow.
00:10:41,00:10:42,Yeah.
00:10:42,00:10:43,Ouch.
00:10:43,00:10:44,That is good.
00:10:44,00:10:49,It got a bit spicy between them during the Tenderest of the Night Save Me the Waltz rivalry.
00:10:49,00:10:50,It doesn't sound good.
00:10:50,00:10:55,"When, well, they obviously, Zelda and Scott Fitzgerald were the Richard Burton and Elizabeth"
00:10:55,00:10:59,"Taylor of that day, and yes, that is the most modern analogy I can come up with."
00:10:59,00:11:02,"Which was basically the same day, they weren't too far off."
00:11:02,00:11:05,"You're right, it was about 10 years later."
00:11:05,00:11:06,"Sorry, God."
00:11:06,00:11:11,"Anyway, yeah, when Zelda said she was going to write Save Me the Waltz, Scott was so annoyed"
00:11:11,00:11:14,"that he wrote to the person who was going to publish her book saying, ""Don't you dare"
00:11:14,00:11:15,"publish it."""
00:11:15,00:11:20,He's got diary entries where he basically plots how to make sure that she doesn't write
00:11:20,00:11:23,"it, so he says, ""Attack on all grounds."
00:11:23,00:11:26,"Play Brackets the Press,"" as in if she's writing a play, suppress it, ""Novel Brackets"
00:11:26,00:11:32,"Delay,"" pictures, ""Brackets the Press,"" as in she did a lot of art, ""Child,"" as in"
00:11:32,00:11:34,"the child they had, ""Brackets Detach."""
00:11:34,00:11:35,It sounds really bad.
00:11:35,00:11:36,It is pretty bad.
00:11:36,00:11:37,It does sound awful.
00:11:37,00:11:43,It was one slight situation was that apparently her doctor said it was bad for her to write
00:11:43,00:11:49,"novels, apparently, and so that might have been one of the reasons why he tried to stop"
00:11:49,00:11:50,her.
00:11:50,00:11:51,Got it.
00:11:51,00:11:54,"But they did have a chat about who was going to publish what, where he accused her of being"
00:11:54,00:12:01,"a third-rate writer, a useless society woman with an Amazonian and lesbian personality,"
00:12:01,00:12:05,"which, look, she didn't, she didn't love it, but all relationships have problems."
00:12:05,00:12:09,"Well, the thing is, when he said, ""You're a third-rate writer,"" she said, ""It seems"
00:12:09,00:12:12,"to me you're making a rather violent attack if I'm third-rate."""
00:12:12,00:12:13,Yeah.
00:12:13,00:12:16,"I mean, he was quite attacked for his writing, wasn't he?"
00:12:16,00:12:18,He wasn't the best writer himself.
00:12:18,00:12:19,As in the editing process.
00:12:19,00:12:20,Wow.
00:12:20,00:12:21,Huge claim.
00:12:21,00:12:22,I'm not claiming it.
00:12:22,00:12:25,"I mean, Simon Wilson, who was a critic."
00:12:25,00:12:27,One of the greatest writers of all time.
00:12:27,00:12:29,You did just say he wasn't the best writer himself.
00:12:29,00:12:32,I'm saying there was a lot of criticism towards his writing at the time.
00:12:32,00:12:35,"So this side of paradise, one of the critics wrote one of the most illiterate books of"
00:12:35,00:12:37,any merit actually published.
00:12:37,00:12:42,"Supposedly, in the Great Gatsby editing process, punctuation marks just had to be removed because"
00:12:42,00:12:45,"there were, like, hundreds of them, and he just kept chucking them in, and they're like,"
00:12:45,00:12:46,"""Let's get that back out."""
00:12:46,00:12:47,That's what copy editors are for.
00:12:47,00:12:48,Exactly.
00:12:48,00:12:49,Do any of that.
00:12:49,00:12:54,So definitely in the Great Gatsby has got to be Jordan Baker because she's a golfer.
00:12:54,00:12:55,Okay.
00:12:55,00:12:56,Okay.
00:12:56,00:12:57,My gosh.
00:12:57,00:13:02,"She is a friend of Daisy, and she is based on a real-life person called Edith Cummings,"
00:13:02,00:13:09,"who was a friend of the Fitzgeralds, and in the book, Jordan Baker has got a bad reputation"
00:13:09,00:13:13,"that she kind of cheats in golf, but at the time, people saw that it was based on this"
00:13:13,00:13:19,Edith Cummings and said that actually Edith Cummings was as honest as she was bewitching
00:13:19,00:13:23,"because she was famous for being a very, very attractive golfer."
00:13:23,00:13:27,"She was known as the Fairway Flapper, and she was the first golfer of any gender to"
00:13:27,00:13:29,appear on the cover of Time Magazine.
00:13:29,00:13:30,"Oh, cool."
00:13:30,00:13:31,Yeah.
00:13:31,00:13:32,I can believe you found the golf angle in...
00:13:32,00:13:33,I know.
00:13:33,00:13:34,"Of course, it's Gerald."
00:13:34,00:13:36,"Like, there's always a way, isn't there?"
00:13:36,00:13:39,"You see a very distant fairway you think, ""I can get there."""
00:13:39,00:13:40,What's that?
00:13:40,00:13:41,Fitzgerald?
00:13:41,00:13:43,He called Zelda something flapper as well.
00:13:43,00:13:44,Flapper was just a flapper.
00:13:44,00:13:45,A fashionable woman.
00:13:45,00:13:46,"Oh, yeah."
00:13:46,00:13:47,I'd never heard that.
00:13:47,00:13:48,"No, no."
00:13:48,00:13:51,"But Zelda was good at golf, by the way, just to get us back to golf."
00:13:51,00:13:53,Sorry to try and move it away.
00:13:53,00:13:57,"So, Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald used to spend the summers at White Bear Lake where"
00:13:57,00:14:01,"there was a golf course, and apparently she was much better at golf than he was."
00:14:01,00:14:03,"Oh, he went up like that."
00:14:03,00:14:06,So him and Zelda had quite an interesting start to their marriage.
00:14:06,00:14:11,"I don't know how well she comes across, so she was a very high society, very wealthy."
00:14:11,00:14:16,"I think her father was a Supreme Court judge or something, and he was fine, but as you"
00:14:16,00:14:20,"can see, if you read The Great Gatsby, he's kind of obsessed with this posh people versus"
00:14:20,00:14:22,not posh people.
00:14:22,00:14:27,"And so, Zelda felt that he was beneath her, and so they had a relationship, and then"
00:14:27,00:14:29,she kind of dumped him for being too poor.
00:14:29,00:14:32,"And then he wrote, I think it was he wrote This Side of Paradise."
00:14:32,00:14:33,It sold out in three days.
00:14:33,00:14:38,"He suddenly made lots of money, and within a week, she'd gone, ""All right, let's get"
00:14:38,00:14:39,"married."""
00:14:39,00:14:40,Fair enough.
00:14:40,00:14:45,"So, F. Scott Fitzgerald's secretary, Francis Kroll, right, the last secretary in his life."
00:14:45,00:14:48,"Okay, F. Scott Fitzgerald died in 1940, okay, age 44."
00:14:48,00:14:50,When do you think his last secretary died?
00:14:50,00:14:51,Yesterday.
00:14:51,00:14:57,"Okay, let's say she was 20 when she was his secretary in 1944, and she died when she was"
00:14:57,00:14:58,100.
00:14:58,00:15:01,"The maths is going very badly for me, I don't like when people work it out."
00:15:01,00:15:02,So she's still alive?
00:15:02,00:15:03,"Yeah, all right."
00:15:03,00:15:05,"Okay, guys, you've really taken the sting out of this one."
00:15:05,00:15:07,She's dead.
00:15:07,00:15:12,"She died in 2015, aged 99, so one year off, James, but I just think that's amazing that,"
00:15:12,00:15:16,"you know, she would have remembered being F. Scott Fitzgerald's secretary, but she also"
00:15:16,00:15:20,"saw, what's an event, like the alternative vote referendum, or..."
00:15:20,00:15:25,"Do you think those will be her two main memories on her deathbeds, life flattered before my"
00:15:25,00:15:27,"eyes, the AV referendum?"
00:15:27,00:15:29,"The Scottish independence vote, you know?"
00:15:29,00:15:32,"Cannot believe that's the only place you could go from there, okay?"
00:15:32,00:15:33,The 2012 Olympics.
00:15:33,00:15:35,The fall of the burning wall.
00:15:35,00:15:37,"When was it, 2015?"
00:15:37,00:15:38,2015.
00:15:38,00:15:39,The...
00:15:39,00:15:40,When she died?
00:15:40,00:15:41,"Yeah, yeah."
00:15:41,00:15:42,The premiere ship.
00:15:42,00:15:43,"No, sadly."
00:15:43,00:15:47,"But she might have heard the first few episodes and know such thing as a fish, which is..."
00:15:47,00:15:48,Oh my God!
00:15:48,00:15:51,Maybe that's what killed her then.
00:15:51,00:15:59,"Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James."
00:15:59,00:16:04,"Okay, my fact this week is that to protect the city of Syracuse, Archimedes invented"
00:16:04,00:16:10,a giant claw that could lift enemy ships clean out of the water.
00:16:10,00:16:15,It was so successful that Roman soldiers began to be scared of any piece of rope hanging
00:16:15,00:16:17,from the city walls.
00:16:17,00:16:21,"This is, I just to quickly say, fucking insane."
00:16:21,00:16:22,"It's amazing, isn't it?"
00:16:22,00:16:23,It's incredible.
00:16:23,00:16:28,"So, why were they scared of rope if it was the giant claw that..."
00:16:28,00:16:31,"Because that's what presages the giant claw, isn't it?"
00:16:31,00:16:32,Is it?
00:16:32,00:16:33,Yeah.
00:16:33,00:16:34,"Because you have a little bit of rope and you're like, ""Oh shit, what's that rope attached"
00:16:34,00:16:35,"to?"""
00:16:35,00:16:36,And it's attached to the claw?
00:16:36,00:16:37,Could be.
00:16:37,00:16:39,So does a rope lead out ahead of the claw?
00:16:39,00:16:42,"Well, you need the rope, because the thing is with Archimedes, he was going to leave"
00:16:42,00:16:46,"us some pulleys and stuff like that, so they all have ropes involved."
00:16:46,00:16:47,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:16:47,00:16:48,And I've seen drawings of this.
00:16:48,00:16:52,"I mean, it's like a real life size, you know, when you go to the arcades and you've got"
00:16:52,00:16:54,the claw that you're trying to pick the time.
00:16:54,00:16:56,It's like this giant claw that is just...
00:16:56,00:17:01,"I don't think they're contemporary drawings, the ones that you've seen."
00:17:01,00:17:03,They might be imaginations.
00:17:03,00:17:04,"Yeah, exactly."
00:17:04,00:17:09,"But like, to show what size claw you'd need to pick up a ship, it's pretty big."
00:17:09,00:17:10,Okay.
00:17:10,00:17:15,"So this is around two on two B.C., we're talking the Second Punic War."
00:17:15,00:17:19,"Rome has taken over all of Italy, but they need somewhere else to take over."
00:17:19,00:17:24,"So they go down to Sicily, which is where Archimedes lived, and it was currently owned"
00:17:24,00:17:28,"by Carthage, which is modern-day Tunisia."
00:17:28,00:17:32,"But then the Romans managed to take over it, but then the people in Syracuse, the main"
00:17:32,00:17:34,"city, decided they're going to rise up."
00:17:34,00:17:39,"So they start to rise up against the Romans, the Romans siege the city, and then Archimedes,"
00:17:39,00:17:43,"the great mathematician, lives there, and he's like, ""Well, I'm going to come up with"
00:17:43,00:17:48,"all these great contraptions that are going to stop the Romans from taking our city."""
00:17:48,00:17:49,And this was one of these.
00:17:49,00:17:54,"And the earliest we have for this particular claw thing is by someone called Polybius, who"
00:17:54,00:17:57,was writing only about 50 years after Archimedes died.
00:17:57,00:17:59,So it's the reasonable chance that it was true.
00:17:59,00:18:02,Do you know what's amazing about this fact is that one of the great Archimedes stories
00:18:02,00:18:06,is that he created a sort of death ray for incoming ships.
00:18:06,00:18:10,"So they would point mirrors, and they would use and harness the sun, and that would give"
00:18:10,00:18:14,"this great beam that would burn holes into the ships, and so on."
00:18:14,00:18:15,Turns out that's not true.
00:18:15,00:18:19,"Now, that's such a shame, because that's such a wonderful thing."
00:18:19,00:18:24,"It's very rare that you then get given this gift of an even more batshit idea, and that"
00:18:24,00:18:26,turns out to be true.
00:18:26,00:18:27,We don't know.
00:18:27,00:18:29,So this is all stuff that's reported about him after.
00:18:29,00:18:33,"So that's Galen said that three centuries later, or something, about the death ray."
00:18:33,00:18:36,"And we think it's probably not true, because it seems completely impossible that you do"
00:18:36,00:18:41,"it, mostly because to focus a death ray, so the idea was you'd have huge mirrors, I suppose,"
00:18:41,00:18:46,"that would be concave, I guess, and they'd focus a ray directly at a point on a ship."
00:18:46,00:18:48,But you need to focus it at one point for quite a long time.
00:18:48,00:18:49,The ship is moving.
00:18:49,00:18:51,The ship is moving around.
00:18:51,00:18:52,You need to perfectly still there.
00:18:52,00:18:53,Not if you're being sieged.
00:18:53,00:18:54,That's a good point.
00:18:54,00:18:55,If they've tied up the ship.
00:18:55,00:18:59,"Actually, Anna has been tried the death ray with the mirrors and the thing."
00:18:59,00:19:04,"So some students at MIT, I think it was in about 2007 or 2008, they got 127 mirrored"
00:19:04,00:19:09,"tiles and an oak replica of a Roman ship, and they proved it was possible."
00:19:09,00:19:10,Did they?
00:19:10,00:19:11,They did it.
00:19:11,00:19:12,Nice.
00:19:12,00:19:13,Did they put it on the water?
00:19:13,00:19:17,"I don't know if they did it, or if they had to hold the ship in exactly the same place"
00:19:17,00:19:18,for six days or whatever.
00:19:18,00:19:22,"So it might be untrue, but it still might be possible."
00:19:22,00:19:28,"One reason it might be untrue is, like Anna says, it was quite a while after it happened"
00:19:28,00:19:29,that people wrote about it.
00:19:29,00:19:34,"Lucy, and I think it was the very first person in 160 AD, but the same story is told of another"
00:19:34,00:19:39,"person, Proclus of Athens, and usually when the same story is told about two or three"
00:19:39,00:19:43,"different famous people, usually it means it's probably a madey-upy thingy."
00:19:43,00:19:46,Do you think the grappling hook happened with the ships?
00:19:46,00:19:47,I just can't.
00:19:47,00:19:51,"I just can't believe it, even though it's obviously people said it happened, but the"
00:19:51,00:19:53,descriptions are so extraordinary.
00:19:53,00:19:59,"So I think in Plutarch's description, he said, ""A ship was frequently lifted up to"
00:19:59,00:20:05,"a great height in the air, a dreadful thing to behold, no ship, and was rolled to and"
00:20:05,00:20:09,"fro and kept swinging until all the sailors were thrown out."""
00:20:09,00:20:12,"I mean, it sounds like one of those rides at a theme park, actually."
00:20:12,00:20:13,Yeah.
00:20:13,00:20:14,You know the...
00:20:14,00:20:15,All the swinging ship rides.
00:20:15,00:20:16,Yeah.
00:20:16,00:20:17,Yeah.
00:20:17,00:20:18,What theme park are you going to?
00:20:18,00:20:21,That all of the people inside the bar are being shut down.
00:20:21,00:20:24,Because before they invented the safety bar.
00:20:24,00:20:25,Yeah.
00:20:25,00:20:30,"Plutarch was writing around 1080, so that was quite a few hundred years later."
00:20:30,00:20:35,"And I think whether it happened or not, certainly as you get further away from the supposed"
00:20:35,00:20:38,"time, the stories get less and less realistic."
00:20:38,00:20:39,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:20:39,00:20:42,"Archimedes, there's so many stories about him, though, that's the thing, isn't it?"
00:20:42,00:20:47,"Like, maybe the thing everyone gets taught is that he shouted Eureka and he jumped out"
00:20:47,00:20:51,of his bath because he discovered the Archimedes principle about displacing water.
00:20:51,00:20:56,"He was weighing, trying to work out how much gold was in the king's crown, wasn't it?"
00:20:56,00:20:57,Right.
00:20:57,00:21:00,"Yeah, he put it in the bath and the amount of water that tipped out told him how dense"
00:21:00,00:21:01,it was.
00:21:01,00:21:02,Exactly.
00:21:02,00:21:03,Yeah.
00:21:03,00:21:04,But he was an incredible mathematician.
00:21:04,00:21:09,"You know, he did brilliant work on the surface area of volume of spheres or centres of gravity"
00:21:09,00:21:10,and floating objects.
00:21:10,00:21:13,And so they're really complicated ideas and it seems unlikely he would have got so excited
00:21:13,00:21:15,that he would have jumped out of his bath or run out of his naked.
00:21:15,00:21:16,That's true.
00:21:16,00:21:20,"We know that he didn't like to go in the bath, again, according to Plutax, I'm writing quite"
00:21:20,00:21:26,"long down the line, but he was writing, yeah, 200 years later saying this guy was a stinky"
00:21:26,00:21:30,"old guy who never took a bath, but he said that his servants used to take him against"
00:21:30,00:21:32,his will to the bath.
00:21:32,00:21:38,"And when he was in there, they would put oil on him and instead of washing himself, he"
00:21:38,00:21:43,would draw like mathematical symbols on his body so he could do the maths on his own body.
00:21:43,00:21:47,"It's like when you draw like in the shower, when you kind of write your name on the glass"
00:21:47,00:21:48,of the shower.
00:21:48,00:21:49,Exactly like that.
00:21:49,00:21:52,I was thinking of it as a kind of clever way of getting a child to eat his peas.
00:21:52,00:21:53,That's really clever.
00:21:53,00:21:55,Cover them with oil so they can write their equations on their chest.
00:21:55,00:22:00,"No, I just sort of mean it's a way of tricking Archimedes into washing himself, basically."
00:22:00,00:22:02,"Well, I'm pretending that he's a black bard."
00:22:02,00:22:03,"Yeah, exactly."
00:22:03,00:22:05,That gets sort of crafty.
00:22:05,00:22:09,"I tried to find out more recent sources about Archimedes, so you know the sites where you"
00:22:09,00:22:13,"type in any celebrity's name, basically, and it gives you all the auto-google results."
00:22:13,00:22:14,"Oh, yeah."
00:22:14,00:22:15,Okay.
00:22:15,00:22:18,"So I've been on who'sdatedwho.com, who is he dating right now?"
00:22:18,00:22:22,"Apparently, Archimedes is possibly single according to who'sdatedwho.com."
00:22:22,00:22:27,"I went on celebwiki.net measurements, not available."
00:22:27,00:22:28,Bodybuild average.
00:22:28,00:22:29,Are these sites...
00:22:29,00:22:30,And what are they?
00:22:30,00:22:31,What are these?
00:22:31,00:22:32,What are you talking about?
00:22:32,00:22:36,"You know, these automatically generated sites that just asset strip from all over the internet"
00:22:36,00:22:40,and they just come up with dubious figures and celebrity net worth or whatever.
00:22:40,00:22:41,I just thought I'd try it for Archimedes.
00:22:41,00:22:44,And it turns out he's on all these sites and they know it.
00:22:44,00:22:45,They don't know anything about him.
00:22:45,00:22:46,They don't know anything about him.
00:22:46,00:22:48,"They've got it right mostly, haven't they?"
00:22:48,00:22:53,"Well, it just goes to show, like, if Plutarch found it hard, like, now celebwiki.net is finding"
00:22:53,00:22:54,it even harder to correct.
00:22:54,00:22:58,"Do you think in a thousand years time there'll be a podcast going, ""Did you know Archimedes"
00:22:58,00:23:04,"was of average build and was probably single, according to the sources that were written"
00:23:04,00:23:07,"only 2,000 years after he died?"""
00:23:07,00:23:08,Something Syracuse.
00:23:08,00:23:09,"He was in Syracuse, right?"
00:23:09,00:23:10,That's where he's from.
00:23:10,00:23:16,"Syracuse had one very, in particular thing in common with the UK today."
00:23:16,00:23:18,Can you guess what it is?
00:23:18,00:23:21,It was a services economy rather than goods based.
00:23:21,00:23:22,No.
00:23:22,00:23:23,You say the UK?
00:23:23,00:23:24,"The UK, yeah."
00:23:24,00:23:25,"You said the UK, right?"
00:23:25,00:23:27,"I mean, you're never going to get this in a billion years."
00:23:27,00:23:33,"So, was it about gold?"
00:23:33,00:23:36,It was that they only had one or a remaker.
00:23:36,00:23:38,Oh my gosh.
00:23:38,00:23:42,"So, do you remember a couple of weeks ago we found out there was only one or a remaker"
00:23:42,00:23:43,in the UK?
00:23:43,00:23:44,Yeah.
00:23:44,00:23:50,"Well, there was only one or a remaker in Syracuse and it was Archimedes because he invented"
00:23:50,00:23:51,it.
00:23:51,00:23:55,"But it feels like we've got them on the way up, but he bent them on the way down at that"
00:23:55,00:23:56,end.
00:23:56,00:23:57,"It wasn't in decline then, was it?"
00:23:57,00:24:01,"And a thousand years ago, in between those two points, like one in ten people made all"
00:24:01,00:24:02,of these full time.
00:24:02,00:24:03,Yeah.
00:24:03,00:24:05,I can't believe we didn't get that chance.
00:24:05,00:24:06,I feel so stupid.
00:24:06,00:24:08,It was looking you right in the face on the side.
00:24:08,00:24:09,Damn it.
00:24:09,00:24:13,"He's such a model for the kind of mad scientist trope, isn't he?"
00:24:13,00:24:14,Yeah.
00:24:14,00:24:15,Yeah.
00:24:15,00:24:16,And it must be true.
00:24:16,00:24:19,I guess all these things must spring from a truth that he was so obsessed with his bloody
00:24:19,00:24:20,mouth.
00:24:20,00:24:21,You couldn't even get him in a bath.
00:24:21,00:24:23,There must have been something to that.
00:24:23,00:24:26,He was incredible at golf because he could just calculate.
00:24:26,00:24:28,He could count the number of shots he played.
00:24:28,00:24:29,Exactly.
00:24:29,00:24:30,Amazing.
00:24:30,00:24:31,Yeah.
00:24:31,00:24:32,He just had one big lever.
00:24:32,00:24:35,His golf club was one huge lever.
00:24:35,00:24:36,Every shot was a putt for him.
00:24:36,00:24:41,Do you know you can buy golf clubs where you hold it next to a ball and then it has a little
00:24:41,00:24:46,mechanism inside the club head and it just fires out and shoots out and hits the ball
00:24:46,00:24:48,exactly the right distance that you want it to go.
00:24:48,00:24:49,So you don't have to swing it or anything.
00:24:49,00:24:50,You don't do the swing.
00:24:50,00:24:52,Just hold it still and it just shoots off.
00:24:52,00:24:55,"Kind of like the alien's jaws in ""Alien"", you know, where it just open up like..."
00:24:55,00:24:56,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:24:56,00:24:57,And what's the point in that?
00:24:57,00:24:59,Because that doesn't seem to take away some of the playing.
00:24:59,00:25:00,You're still going to walk.
00:25:00,00:25:02,You're still going to walk to where the ball is.
00:25:02,00:25:07,"Imagine you're a disabled person who can't swing a golf club, but you still want to play."
00:25:07,00:25:11,"You still want to hit the ball and you want to aim it and stuff like that, but you can't"
00:25:11,00:25:12,swing it.
00:25:12,00:25:13,Okay.
00:25:13,00:25:14,"So you have to point it right, I guess."
00:25:14,00:25:15,Oh yeah.
00:25:15,00:25:16,You've got to point it.
00:25:16,00:25:17,Yeah.
00:25:17,00:25:19,He calculated the total number of grains of sand in the universe as could possibly be
00:25:19,00:25:21,in the universe.
00:25:21,00:25:26,He worked out that it was 10 to the power of 63.
00:25:26,00:25:31,And he worked that out by working out that the entire universe was about two light years
00:25:31,00:25:35,in diameter and he was no one there.
00:25:35,00:25:37,"I mean, he wasn't even in the same ballpark."
00:25:37,00:25:41,You can't see picturing alien planets that have sand on it.
00:25:41,00:25:46,So people had been saying that there was an infinite amount of sand and he wanted to prove
00:25:46,00:25:48,that actually there wasn't an infinite amount of sand.
00:25:48,00:25:53,"There was a finite amount and I could prove that by looking at how big the universe is,"
00:25:53,00:25:56,looking at how big a grain of sand is and working out that there's a maximum that you
00:25:56,00:25:57,could have.
00:25:57,00:26:03,And he said that that maximum was 10 to the power of 63 but unfortunately he didn't realize
00:26:03,00:26:07,that he knew that there were five planets but he didn't know that there were an infinite
00:26:07,00:26:10,number of universes and planets and stuff.
00:26:10,00:26:14,The old all I have to do is look at how big the universe is and that feels like you're
00:26:14,00:26:16,going to trip up at the level of how big the universe is.
00:26:16,00:26:17,It's still very impressive.
00:26:17,00:26:22,It was impressive because you had to basically invent new bits of maths to do it because
00:26:22,00:26:24,they didn't really have big numbers in those days.
00:26:24,00:26:30,"You could talk about 10,000 which is myriad, so that was basically the biggest number you"
00:26:30,00:26:31,could say.
00:26:31,00:26:32,I mean that is really cool.
00:26:32,00:26:36,"And then he came up with like a myriad to the power of a myriad which is 10,000 to"
00:26:36,00:26:39,"the power of 10,000 and then sort of extrapolated from there."
00:26:39,00:26:44,"So weird the idea of inventing big numbers, like inventing big things, because the biggest"
00:26:44,00:26:48,"thing they could think of was 10 meters high, so they invented the idea."
00:26:48,00:26:52,You can see all the academics getting together and then someone going up to the board and
00:26:52,00:26:55,revealing a new zero.
00:26:55,00:27:01,"Has anyone considered 10,000 and one?"
00:27:01,00:27:08,"Okay, it is time for fact number three."
00:27:08,00:27:10,That is Anna.
00:27:10,00:27:15,My fact this week is that most black swallower fish specimens died because they ate too much
00:27:15,00:27:17,and their stomachs exploded.
00:27:17,00:27:18,Wow.
00:27:18,00:27:21,Weird life trajectory they have.
00:27:21,00:27:23,It is a lot weird going on in that sense.
00:27:23,00:27:27,"Yeah, so the black swallower fish is a type of fish."
00:27:27,00:27:32,"When I say specimens, I mean ones that we found, a specimen is something that a scientist"
00:27:32,00:27:36,"looks at in researches, so it is not clear that this is how most of them die, it is just"
00:27:36,00:27:40,all the ones we have found have floated up to the top of the water because this has happened
00:27:40,00:27:44,"and the reason this has happened is because they are amazing at swallowing, sometimes"
00:27:44,00:27:45,too good.
00:27:45,00:27:48,So they are about 20 centimeters long.
00:27:48,00:27:52,"They can swallow prey that is over twice as long as them, I mean one of them was found"
00:27:52,00:27:58,with prey four times as long as it is in its body and ten times the mass.
00:27:58,00:28:00,"So if you look up pictures of them, they are just the best."
00:28:00,00:28:04,It looks like they are carrying a huge bit of carry on luggage under their stomach which
00:28:04,00:28:06,is where they store this food.
00:28:06,00:28:07,It is amazing.
00:28:07,00:28:13,"They look absolutely ridiculous, but sometimes their eyes are too big for their stomachs and"
00:28:13,00:28:17,they will eat something so huge that they cannot digest it quickly enough before it
00:28:17,00:28:18,starts decomposing.
00:28:18,00:28:22,"And when it starts decomposing, it releases all these gases in their stomachs and they"
00:28:22,00:28:26,inflate and they sort of float to the top like a helium balloon and they explode and
00:28:26,00:28:27,then that is where we find them.
00:28:27,00:28:29,Pick them up and go look at this.
00:28:29,00:28:30,It is amazing.
00:28:30,00:28:33,It is kind of not surprising these are the only ones we found because they live quite
00:28:33,00:28:34,deep down don't they?
00:28:34,00:28:35,Yeah.
00:28:35,00:28:36,They live in the twilight zone.
00:28:36,00:28:38,"I know, I love it."
00:28:38,00:28:41,Well they live in the lower twilight and the upper midnight zone.
00:28:41,00:28:43,There are two different zones.
00:28:43,00:28:46,Do you think lots of really weird stuff happens down there that they cannot explain?
00:28:46,00:28:47,I bet.
00:28:47,00:28:49,I mean these things are really freaky.
00:28:49,00:28:51,One thing we don't know is how they prey or we are not sure.
00:28:51,00:28:54,It is basically where they prey forwards or backwards.
00:28:54,00:28:57,"So they have got these teeth which retract, you know like a staged dagger which kind of"
00:28:57,00:29:00,retracts and then pops back out.
00:29:00,00:29:04,"So they have got those basically, but they are pointing backwards I think."
00:29:04,00:29:07,"So the prey can push it, it can push prey into its mouth and the prey then finds it incredibly"
00:29:07,00:29:11,"hard to get out again, but it can go further in."
00:29:11,00:29:12,And so we think it either ...
00:29:12,00:29:16,"I think that is a horrible option isn't it, it is like you can't get out darling, but"
00:29:16,00:29:18,"don't worry, you can go further in."
00:29:18,00:29:19,What?
00:29:19,00:29:22,"That is it, they either bite from the tail end of the prey and just work their way up"
00:29:22,00:29:25,to the head or they bite the head and then work their way down.
00:29:25,00:29:26,"Yeah, they have got really sharp teeth don't they?"
00:29:26,00:29:30,"Yeah, but maybe they bite something too big and then they just have to keep going."
00:29:30,00:29:34,"Yeah, because not only can the prey not escape, but we think that they can't spit anything"
00:29:34,00:29:35,out because of these teeth.
00:29:35,00:29:37,"They are just locked into this thing, so they have to judge quite carefully how big what"
00:29:37,00:29:38,they are eating is.
00:29:38,00:29:42,"It is like if you go to the buffet and you can only go once, you have to really nail"
00:29:42,00:29:43,it.
00:29:43,00:29:44,You get the biggest piece of turkey.
00:29:44,00:29:45,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:29:45,00:29:48,"It is like you have to finish it, otherwise they won't let you leave."
00:29:48,00:29:51,"And you are like, you have still got five sausage rolls there, and you are like, ""Oh,"
00:29:51,00:29:52,"no, no, no, I knew it."""
00:29:52,00:29:59,"The black swallower fish was discovered in 1864 by someone called James Yates Johnson,"
00:29:59,00:30:05,"and he is possibly more notable or as notable for discovering a lot of other fish and spiders,"
00:30:05,00:30:10,but also for donating the moss collection to the Natural History Museum of Madeira.
00:30:10,00:30:11,Wow.
00:30:11,00:30:12,So just a little of moss.
00:30:12,00:30:13,"Can I, James?"
00:30:13,00:30:14,Thank you.
00:30:14,00:30:16,We have a lot of facts at this point in our show from you.
00:30:16,00:30:19,"Andy teed it up back in the day, but it is great."
00:30:19,00:30:22,I am going to have to hand over the moss trousers at some point.
00:30:22,00:30:26,"Jesus Christ, please wash them first."
00:30:26,00:30:30,One cool thing we should say is that their bellies are stretched so thin that they are
00:30:30,00:30:31,transparent.
00:30:31,00:30:32,Yeah.
00:30:32,00:30:33,So you do get a good view.
00:30:33,00:30:35,It is like having a window into there.
00:30:35,00:30:36,It is interesting.
00:30:36,00:30:40,"You get quite a few of these animals that can eat whole prey, not just this one."
00:30:40,00:30:44,"But most of them, I am not most of them, maybe about a quarter of them have got black guts"
00:30:44,00:30:50,"inside of their guts, has got like a black layer so that if you eat something which"
00:30:50,00:30:54,"glows when you eat it, you do not want it to be glowing inside your tummy, otherwise"
00:30:54,00:30:57,all of your enemies are going to be able to come and eat you.
00:30:57,00:31:00,And so they have this black-lined stomach which stops the glow from coming out.
00:31:00,00:31:01,So cool.
00:31:01,00:31:03,"But the black swallow does not have that, I do not think."
00:31:03,00:31:05,"That would be really weird if you, yeah."
00:31:05,00:31:07,You could see what Tom was eating.
00:31:07,00:31:08,Yeah.
00:31:08,00:31:09,Yeah.
00:31:09,00:31:11,Do you think it would help us eat more healthily if we walked around and everyone could look
00:31:11,00:31:14,"in your stomach and go, ""Oh yeah, three pizzas last night."
00:31:14,00:31:15,"Wow."""
00:31:15,00:31:16,I think it would.
00:31:16,00:31:18,So we are not allowed clothes in this scenario.
00:31:18,00:31:20,They have to be transparent.
00:31:20,00:31:23,Just one little transparent window in the middle of your T-shirt.
00:31:23,00:31:27,"Oh, like Rihanna's pregnancy outfit where she showed off her tummy."
00:31:27,00:31:28,Sure.
00:31:28,00:31:29,Yeah.
00:31:29,00:31:30,Yeah.
00:31:30,00:31:31,"Come on guys, keep up."
00:31:31,00:31:32,Did you call her Rihanna?
00:31:32,00:31:36,"Yeah, I really lived into the age, I think, yeah."
00:31:36,00:31:39,"For all I know, that is how she pronounces it but I do not think so."
00:31:39,00:31:41,"Wait, I think she does but only in private."
00:31:41,00:31:45,It sounds like you said in an e-mail to someone about Hannah.
00:31:45,00:31:46,Rihanna.
00:31:46,00:31:47,Rihanna.
00:31:47,00:31:51,What do we think of her clothing choice today?
00:31:51,00:31:55,"Not appropriate for the office, I say."
00:31:55,00:31:56,You know dolphins?
00:31:56,00:31:57,Yeah.
00:31:57,00:31:59,"You know how they, how do they breathe?"
00:31:59,00:32:00,Through their blow holes.
00:32:00,00:32:01,Yeah.
00:32:01,00:32:02,Exactly.
00:32:02,00:32:03,Exciting news.
00:32:03,00:32:06,Scientists in New Zealand have found a dolphin that breathed through its mouth.
00:32:06,00:32:07,Oh yeah.
00:32:07,00:32:08,Yeah.
00:32:08,00:32:09,It is called Hector's Dolphin.
00:32:09,00:32:12,It is a species or the sub breed of dolphin and specifically it is not actually the whole
00:32:12,00:32:13,species.
00:32:13,00:32:16,"It is literally one guy, one dolphin who breathed through his mouth."
00:32:16,00:32:19,"Sorry, is he congested in his blow hole?"
00:32:19,00:32:23,They have noticed some weird thing about the way the trachea links up to the blow hole and
00:32:23,00:32:27,how actually he might have been injured or something but anyway he has found a way around
00:32:27,00:32:32,whatever this past injury was or event in his life and now it just goes around like
00:32:32,00:32:34,a dork breathing through his mouth.
00:32:34,00:32:35,Wow.
00:32:35,00:32:36,That is amazing.
00:32:36,00:32:37,Yeah.
00:32:37,00:32:41,It is like humans and things like belong there like little mermaids.
00:32:41,00:32:46,"So other fish that have interesting ways of eating food, one of them is the lancet fish"
00:32:46,00:32:51,and mostly this is good because it is sort of vaguely similar to the black swallower
00:32:51,00:32:56,in that its contents of its stomach are often in completely pristine condition because
00:32:56,00:32:58,it again eats these huge meals.
00:32:58,00:33:01,So we think it is often fish that live very deep and don't get meals very often so when
00:33:01,00:33:03,you do you have got to really eat shed loads.
00:33:03,00:33:04,It is about seven foot long.
00:33:04,00:33:05,Whoa.
00:33:05,00:33:10,"Yeah, it is huge but it will gorge all these meals and then they just sit in its stomach"
00:33:10,00:33:14,for ages but it means that lots of the new species that we discover of fish and squids
00:33:14,00:33:19,and octopus are based on opening up the contents of the stomach and then you just get a bunch
00:33:19,00:33:21,of new species fall out.
00:33:21,00:33:25,The other interesting thing about lancet fish is that they don't see each other very often
00:33:25,00:33:30,because they live quite deep down and so when they see another lancet fish they are going
00:33:30,00:33:34,to want to mate with it and they don't want to have problems with genders and stuff like
00:33:34,00:33:35,that.
00:33:35,00:33:41,So if two lancet fish come together they are hermaphrodites and they can change when they
00:33:41,00:33:42,meet a new one.
00:33:42,00:33:43,Do they argue about that?
00:33:43,00:33:47,Well I thought it but you know like when you are walking down a pavement and you are not
00:33:47,00:33:50,"sure to turn left or to turn right because someone is walking towards you, I imagine"
00:33:50,00:33:51,there is a lot of that going on.
00:33:51,00:33:52,Yeah.
00:33:52,00:33:56,"So what there are some times where they accidentally both change to mate, sorry, sorry, they both"
00:33:56,00:33:57,change to female.
00:33:57,00:33:58,"Oh, sorry, sorry."
00:33:58,00:34:00,They have a little laugh about it and then move on.
00:34:00,00:34:01,That is cool.
00:34:01,00:34:02,Holding off.
00:34:02,00:34:05,So do you end up just having sex with that person James?
00:34:05,00:34:11,"If you are in a remote enough place, it is actually wisest to have sex with that person"
00:34:11,00:34:13,because you might not see someone for days.
00:34:13,00:34:18,If you are going on a country walk you are going to have sex with two of them.
00:34:18,00:34:22,I guess it is our responsibility to repopulate the earth.
00:34:22,00:34:23,What?
00:34:23,00:34:26,We are in Henley.
00:34:26,00:34:30,I found a pretty weird fish that I want to mention.
00:34:30,00:34:35,"Yeah, this is called the Calogono and it is in Lake Malawi in East Africa and it is"
00:34:35,00:34:38,what is known as kind of like a sleeper fish.
00:34:38,00:34:42,It does this thing where it pretends not to be a fish for most of its life and then it
00:34:42,00:34:44,just comes to life as a fish.
00:34:44,00:34:45,Exactly.
00:34:45,00:34:49,"It is sort of hanging out with some crabs, sort of pretending to be part of the family,"
00:34:49,00:34:52,"getting all the info, waiting for the moment to arrest."
00:34:52,00:34:58,"No, this is a fish that plays dead basically in order to eat food and it lays down and it"
00:34:58,00:35:03,just plays dead and smaller fish will come to either check it out or maybe get a nibble
00:35:03,00:35:09,"on it and as they come it suddenly goes, ""Wah!"" and jumps up, well not jumps but whatever"
00:35:09,00:35:10,fish do.
00:35:10,00:35:11,Swims.
00:35:11,00:35:12,Swims up and eats everyone.
00:35:12,00:35:13,Eats all the spectators.
00:35:13,00:35:16,It is like going to a buffet and you get eaten by the sausage hole.
00:35:16,00:35:17,Exactly.
00:35:17,00:35:22,I am going to slightly off piece of the thing about guts because this is about the black
00:35:22,00:35:24,swallower and how it eats.
00:35:24,00:35:25,Yes.
00:35:25,00:35:30,It is hanging out about uses of cow guts.
00:35:30,00:35:34,Did you know that top flight tennis rackets all used to be made of cow intestines?
00:35:34,00:35:36,"It was used on the strings, wasn't it?"
00:35:36,00:35:40,"It was the strings but until about ten years ago, as in really recently, there was this"
00:35:40,00:35:46,Norfolk film called Bo Brand and I read a few news articles about them and they made
00:35:46,00:35:50,tennis racket strings and harp strings out of cow guts.
00:35:50,00:35:55,I imagine if you accidentally got those mixed up that would be a very melodious game of tennis
00:35:55,00:36:00,and you could turn up with the harp on the court.
00:36:00,00:36:03,"But yeah and I gave them a ring because I thought, ""I can't believe this."""
00:36:03,00:36:06,"It's true and they said, ""Oh yeah, we don't do it anymore."""
00:36:06,00:36:11,"But until about ten years ago, we did and it took four cows to make one tennis racket."
00:36:11,00:36:17,"No, that's too many cows for each, because they use like five tennis rackets per game."
00:36:17,00:36:18,I know.
00:36:18,00:36:23,And that's why you'll often see around the edge of the court like twenty cows just waiting
00:36:23,00:36:24,for them to be...
00:36:24,00:36:27,Actual luck on their faces.
00:36:27,00:36:29,"I think you can play on with that racket actually, Roger."
00:36:29,00:36:32,At least I didn't use silkworm guts.
00:36:32,00:36:34,Do you remember we talked about that?
00:36:34,00:36:35,A lot of silkworms.
00:36:35,00:36:37,Was that just the top-end players or is that every racket?
00:36:37,00:36:42,"No, this is top-end and they used to send a team to Wimbledon."
00:36:42,00:36:46,They would have a little place where they would restring your rackets for you for the
00:36:46,00:36:47,top players and they would...
00:36:47,00:36:48,Oh yeah!
00:36:48,00:36:51,"A stable where they'd do that, wasn't it, around the back?"
00:36:51,00:36:52,Yeah.
00:36:52,00:36:56,That's where they come out bloodstains when they go back onto the courts.
00:36:56,00:36:57,So they all made...
00:36:57,00:36:58,They're all like plastic though.
00:36:58,00:36:59,"I think they are, yeah."
00:36:59,00:37:00,And they said...
00:37:00,00:37:04,"I spoke to a really nice lady at Bo Brand, so thank you to her for talking to me for"
00:37:04,00:37:05,quite a long time actually about this stuff.
00:37:05,00:37:10,"And she said that demand really slackened off about ten years ago, but fortunately it coincided"
00:37:10,00:37:13,with a huge increase in demand for harps.
00:37:13,00:37:16,"No idea why, but basically they just pivoted the business."
00:37:16,00:37:20,"Did you ask her like, what happened ten years ago with that harp and then suddenly it played"
00:37:20,00:37:21,in the background?
00:37:21,00:37:25,I actually thought about what happened.
00:37:25,00:37:33,The Sloan's Viperfish can eat very big things and it does it by opening its jaw up to over
00:37:33,00:37:37,"90 degrees, so it massively opens its mouth and is doing it net right now."
00:37:37,00:37:39,I think I can go over 90 actually.
00:37:39,00:37:43,"Actually, how big do you think your mouth gap is there Anna?"
00:37:43,00:37:44,Would you say...
00:37:44,00:37:45,At a conference or...
00:37:45,00:37:46,At a good angle.
00:37:46,00:37:48,"No, no, top to bottom in centimetres."
00:37:48,00:37:56,"You'd have to ask Archimedes, essentially it's like 4.5."
00:37:56,00:37:57,4.5.
00:37:57,00:38:01,The largest mouth gap for any woman in the world is 6.52 centimetres.
00:38:01,00:38:04,"So you're getting there, Samantha Ramsdell."
00:38:04,00:38:12,She can bite through four single stacked cheeseburgers in one go and fit an entire large-sized French
00:38:12,00:38:14,fries from McDonald's in her mouth.
00:38:14,00:38:17,"Oh wow, standing up, so she eats fries vertically."
00:38:17,00:38:18,Is that what you're saying?
00:38:18,00:38:19,"Oh, yeah."
00:38:19,00:38:20,I think like you bundle them like straws.
00:38:20,00:38:21,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:38:21,00:38:23,I thought you meant the full thing.
00:38:23,00:38:24,"No, no, no."
00:38:24,00:38:25,Cheese fries.
00:38:25,00:38:26,That's a real...
00:38:26,00:38:28,Cheese fries vertically.
00:38:28,00:38:32,It's some kind of sick burn.
00:38:32,00:38:38,She can be seen on TikTok sometimes with a guy called Isaac Johnson who has the male
00:38:38,00:38:42,record gape and his is 9.52 centimetres.
00:38:42,00:38:43,That's big.
00:38:43,00:38:44,That's big.
00:38:44,00:38:45,That's big.
00:38:45,00:38:47,So they're a couple because I want to see them snog.
00:38:47,00:38:48,Yes.
00:38:48,00:38:51,"No one wants to see that, do they?"
00:38:51,00:38:52,Oh my God.
00:38:52,00:38:57,They can snog when they can hold a billiard ball in between their tongues as they're doing.
00:38:57,00:39:04,"Isaac can fit objects such as a baseball, a soda can, or a large apple in his mouth."
00:39:04,00:39:06,"Oh, that's really put it in context for me."
00:39:06,00:39:12,I once saw a really big apple at the offices of We Buy Any Card dot com in Haringay.
00:39:12,00:39:15,I reckon he could fit that in because it was a massive apple.
00:39:15,00:39:17,Good plan for We Buy Any Card dot com.
00:39:17,00:39:20,I'd like to drill down into this a bit.
00:39:20,00:39:21,Was it on display?
00:39:21,00:39:22,Was it...
00:39:22,00:39:23,I reckon.
00:39:23,00:39:24,You think our cars are good?
00:39:24,00:39:25,Wait till you...
00:39:25,00:39:26,You should have...
00:39:26,00:39:27,"Honestly, this apple was so massive."
00:39:27,00:39:30,Dan's got a large coffee cup here.
00:39:30,00:39:32,I reckon it was as tall as that.
00:39:32,00:39:33,"Oh, that's insane."
00:39:33,00:39:37,All I could do when he was talking to me was look at this apple because it was so massive.
00:39:37,00:39:38,Were you trying to sell them a car at the time?
00:39:38,00:39:43,"I gave them... yeah, I sold them a car, yeah."
00:39:43,00:39:44,What apple?
00:39:44,00:39:45,"Oh, my God."
00:39:45,00:39:47,It's Jack and the Beanstalk all over again.
00:39:47,00:39:52,"You go home, your agent mother is saying, ""Did you manage to sell the car to let us live?"""
00:39:52,00:39:54,"No, but I got this big old apple."
00:39:54,00:39:58,"They just say in Jack and the Beanstalk, right, the moral of that story is that you"
00:39:58,00:40:03,should sell your cow for beans because he gets the beans and he gets a massive beanstalk
00:40:03,00:40:05,"and then he gets a golden chicken or something, doesn't he?"
00:40:05,00:40:06,And how much of that?
00:40:06,00:40:07,A golden chicken?
00:40:07,00:40:08,A golden chicken.
00:40:08,00:40:09,You've misread that story.
00:40:09,00:40:11,Does he not get a golden head or something?
00:40:11,00:40:12,A golden goose?
00:40:12,00:40:13,Yeah.
00:40:13,00:40:14,Does he get a golden goose at the time?
00:40:14,00:40:15,"Yeah, but then he steals it from the time."
00:40:15,00:40:18,"He chimes down the Beanstalk after it, but then he has to cut the Beanstalk down and"
00:40:18,00:40:19,then...
00:40:19,00:40:20,He does all that.
00:40:20,00:40:23,"Like, basically, he's taken a risk at the very start of that story, you know, selling"
00:40:23,00:40:26,his car or whatever it was for some beans.
00:40:26,00:40:30,"And then he's had to go through a few troubles, but at the end he gets a golden goose that"
00:40:30,00:40:31,lays golden eggs.
00:40:31,00:40:34,So the moral of the story is do something stupid.
00:40:34,00:40:36,"At the end, it'll work out fine."
00:40:36,00:40:39,Are you trying to justify giving away your car for an apple?
00:40:39,00:40:40,Because it feels like you are.
00:40:40,00:40:41,How much?
00:40:41,00:40:42,It's a big apple.
00:40:42,00:40:43,It's not any old apple.
00:40:43,00:40:47,"Look, my wife didn't buy this and you guys aren't buying it either."
00:40:47,00:40:56,"Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show, and that is my fact."
00:40:56,00:41:01,My fact this week is that there is a cathedral in Norway currently restoring its rooftop with
00:41:01,00:41:07,large amounts of urine from a retired field horse called Norik.
00:41:07,00:41:11,Norik likes to pee into a bucket at specific times every single day.
00:41:11,00:41:12,Wow.
00:41:12,00:41:13,So...
00:41:13,00:41:14,A lot to unpack there.
00:41:14,00:41:15,A lot to unpack here with this story.
00:41:15,00:41:18,"I should just quickly say I got sent this story by a friend of mine, Riggs, who lives"
00:41:18,00:41:19,in Norway.
00:41:19,00:41:23,She spotted it and it was a calling out for horse urine.
00:41:23,00:41:25,So the story is basically that there is a very old cathedral there.
00:41:25,00:41:26,It's called Niderås Cathedral.
00:41:26,00:41:31,"It's in Trondheim, and the idea is that they're doing the roof at the moment, but the problem"
00:41:31,00:41:35,"is that in order to get the roof back to the state that they want to get it to, they need"
00:41:35,00:41:36,to oxidize the copper.
00:41:36,00:41:42,"And in order to do that, it's been discovered that you can use horse urine or cow urine."
00:41:42,00:41:46,"So to oxidize the copper, you mean like it goes from the shiny color to like a green"
00:41:46,00:41:47,color?
00:41:47,00:41:48,Exactly.
00:41:48,00:41:52,"So if you know a green color on a cathedral roof, that is the state that it needs to be"
00:41:52,00:41:55,"in, but it takes a long time to do that and it can take decades in fact."
00:41:55,00:41:59,"But by using horse urine, they are able to speed up the process."
00:41:59,00:42:02,The issue is where do you get that much horse urine?
00:42:02,00:42:03,From a horse.
00:42:03,00:42:04,"From a horse, right?"
00:42:04,00:42:06,"But, you know, who's going to give you that urine?"
00:42:06,00:42:10,"You need to do a calling out to the world, or specifically to that very tiny bit of Norway."
00:42:10,00:42:11,And so that's what they did.
00:42:11,00:42:13,"The people said, ""Do you have horse urine?"
00:42:13,00:42:14,"We need it."""
00:42:14,00:42:19,"And this was spotted by someone who has a very old horse called Norik, who has this very"
00:42:19,00:42:25,"curious thing, which is that Norik likes to pee at certain times indoors every day."
00:42:25,00:42:27,And so what they do is they bring Norik in.
00:42:27,00:42:32,He comes for his daily pee at a certain time and he's been supplying sort of most of the
00:42:32,00:42:33,pee.
00:42:33,00:42:34,Amazing.
00:42:34,00:42:35,Okay.
00:42:35,00:42:36,"They sent it on Facebook, didn't they?"
00:42:36,00:42:37,Yeah.
00:42:37,00:42:42,"It's on a group called ""It Happens in Bin Niset,"" which I think is a town near Trondheim."
00:42:42,00:42:43,"And they said, ""Hello."
00:42:43,00:42:47,"A somewhat special request, but we would love to get our hands on about four to five liters"
00:42:47,00:42:49,of horse urine.
00:42:49,00:42:54,"If you have an opportunity to help with this, feel free to contact Henning Grott, stone cutter"
00:42:54,00:42:55,at the cathedral.
00:42:55,00:42:59,"I'm interested that they collect it in a bucket, because that does imply that someone's"
00:42:59,00:43:02,"wasting there all the time, because you don't know when a horse is going to weep."
00:43:02,00:43:04,You just go into the stable and they've done it all over the hay.
00:43:04,00:43:05,"But this is the point, though."
00:43:05,00:43:06,So it chooses.
00:43:06,00:43:07,And does it over the bucket?
00:43:07,00:43:08,Yeah.
00:43:08,00:43:09,Yeah.
00:43:09,00:43:10,"I mean, there's actually a video that you can see online."
00:43:10,00:43:11,So Norik is about to take a pee.
00:43:11,00:43:16,It's basically just a shot of his penis in camera and then the urine starts coming out.
00:43:16,00:43:18,A bucket comes underneath it and starts collecting.
00:43:18,00:43:19,Yeah.
00:43:19,00:43:22,"So actually there's a stable hand who has to sit in the stable all day, every day, until"
00:43:22,00:43:24,he starts peeing and then shove the bucket underneath his wooly.
00:43:24,00:43:26,This is how you got a urine sample from a horse.
00:43:26,00:43:31,I was looking up how you do it and I was on the website horsesidevetguide.com and it
00:43:31,00:43:34,said what you do is you get a disposable coffee cup.
00:43:34,00:43:38,So Dan's got a disposable coffee cup here and you attach that to a broom handle and
00:43:38,00:43:41,then you wait for the horse to start peeing and then you just move it slowly into position
00:43:41,00:43:45,"and then you catch the midstream urine, which is the good stuff if you're testing horses"
00:43:45,00:43:46,healthy.
00:43:46,00:43:49,"If you want to at home picture how big my cup is, by the way, it's roughly the same size"
00:43:49,00:43:50,as a beer.
00:43:50,00:43:52,"Well, like a few jettles."
00:43:52,00:43:53,That's just for the listener.
00:43:53,00:43:57,An apple that I would say would be worth a car.
00:43:57,00:44:02,There's a few different ways that they could have done this instead of putting horse urine
00:44:02,00:44:05,on the roof.
00:44:05,00:44:11,They could have covered it in hard boiled eggs and that would have done the job.
00:44:11,00:44:14,They could have used Miracle Grow Plant Fertiliser.
00:44:14,00:44:15,I've got some of that.
00:44:15,00:44:18,"Well, you can use that to oxidise your copper."
00:44:18,00:44:19,"Oh, great."
00:44:19,00:44:20,Is that what is that?
00:44:20,00:44:21,Because of nitrogen?
00:44:21,00:44:23,"It's the ammonia we think in the urine, isn't it?"
00:44:23,00:44:24,Yes.
00:44:24,00:44:27,"So in the urine, it's ammonia."
00:44:27,00:44:31,"Now urine doesn't have any ammonia in it, but it does contain things that bacteria like"
00:44:31,00:44:32,and you have bacteria in the air.
00:44:32,00:44:36,So that bacteria goes into the urine and then the bacteria creates ammonia.
00:44:36,00:44:39,So you couldn't use just fresh out of the horse urine.
00:44:39,00:44:41,You need to leave it to stand for a bit.
00:44:41,00:44:45,But sulfur also works and that's what you get with your hard boiled eggs.
00:44:45,00:44:47,That's so clever.
00:44:47,00:44:48,"It would stink, though."
00:44:48,00:44:51,You've smeared egg soul for all over your church roof.
00:44:51,00:44:52,"Well, more than horse piss?"
00:44:52,00:44:54,"Yeah, actually, that causes differences."
00:44:54,00:44:59,"Another one you could do would be salt and vinegar crisps, apparently."
00:44:59,00:45:06,"That is apparently an age-old, can't be that old, but it's a way of doing this that you"
00:45:06,00:45:07,see on there.
00:45:07,00:45:10,That's how they did Westminster Abbey originally.
00:45:10,00:45:16,Just back to this idea about Norric going in at certain times and peeing into the bucket.
00:45:16,00:45:19,"I was reading a blog the other day and it actually has this really interesting thing,"
00:45:19,00:45:23,which is that horses can be taught to pee on command.
00:45:23,00:45:24,They can be toilet-trained.
00:45:24,00:45:25,They can be toilet-trained.
00:45:25,00:45:26,Really?
00:45:26,00:45:28,"But what about that old saying, you can take a horse to the toilet, but you can't make"
00:45:28,00:45:29,it piss?
00:45:29,00:45:30,Yes.
00:45:30,00:45:35,"Well, in the article that I was reading, it did sort of say that what it's useful really"
00:45:35,00:45:37,"is, you know, horse shows."
00:45:37,00:45:42,"If a horse is going out into the ring and it's about to do an act, you don't want your horse"
00:45:42,00:45:43,"shitting and pissing everywhere, do you?"
00:45:43,00:45:49,"And so if you can get your horse to go beforehand by teaching it when to go, you're fine."
00:45:49,00:45:54,"What you need to do is, when you see a horse pissing, quickly go up beside it and just"
00:45:54,00:45:55,start whistling.
00:45:55,00:46:01,Just go whistling and whistle to the exact length of their pee.
00:46:01,00:46:05,"Now, obviously, you might not have that much breath, so catch your breath back into the"
00:46:05,00:46:06,whistle.
00:46:06,00:46:07,"Yeah, no, no."
00:46:07,00:46:09,I know what whistle sounds like.
00:46:09,00:46:10,Great.
00:46:10,00:46:11,So you've done that.
00:46:11,00:46:12,Go away.
00:46:12,00:46:13,You're seeing the horse pee again later.
00:46:13,00:46:16,Go back quickly to its side as it's peeing.
00:46:16,00:46:22,"Do this for weeks and weeks and weeks, and then after weeks, you'll find that when you"
00:46:22,00:46:28,"go near a horse that probably needs a pee and you go, it goes the other way around."
00:46:28,00:46:30,The horse starts peeing to your whistle.
00:46:30,00:46:31,Amazing.
00:46:31,00:46:35,It's suddenly you're enabling the piss via your whistle.
00:46:35,00:46:37,"It's not much of a superpower, is it?"
00:46:37,00:46:41,It's making any horse piss on demand.
00:46:41,00:46:43,"And you get therapy horses, though, don't you?"
00:46:43,00:46:44,Or guide horses.
00:46:44,00:46:49,"Some blind people who are allergic to dogs have to have guide ponies, you remember?"
00:46:49,00:46:50,Just a small pony.
00:46:50,00:46:51,Shetland.
00:46:51,00:46:52,"Yeah, yeah."
00:46:52,00:46:53,Like a little Shetland pony.
00:46:53,00:46:54,Shire horse.
00:46:54,00:46:55,Yeah.
00:46:55,00:46:58,"I mean, I haven't been on the London Underground when a horse comes on the carriage."
00:46:58,00:46:59,No.
00:46:59,00:47:00,But that is a thing.
00:47:00,00:47:02,I guess they have to have some kind of training system.
00:47:02,00:47:03,Yeah.
00:47:03,00:47:04,"Well, you can pee."
00:47:04,00:47:05,I mean.
00:47:05,00:47:06,"Well, there are nappies as well."
00:47:06,00:47:07,You can get a horse nappies.
00:47:07,00:47:10,You said that as if it was a really standard piece of information.
00:47:10,00:47:11,It was.
00:47:11,00:47:12,So who wears the nappies?
00:47:12,00:47:13,The guide horses?
00:47:13,00:47:14,Yeah.
00:47:14,00:47:17,"Or horses that are, you know, doing, I guess, presentations."
00:47:17,00:47:19,"I mean, that's worse."
00:47:19,00:47:25,"In dressage, you'd rather the horse just weed than you've got some huge nappy."
00:47:25,00:47:31,"Rodin used urine on his sculptures, not horse urine, but he used to instruct his assistants"
00:47:31,00:47:36,"to go out into his, like, outdoor studio and urinate all over the bronze statues in the"
00:47:36,00:47:37,yard.
00:47:37,00:47:38,"Oh, bronzes."
00:47:38,00:47:39,I was thinking stone.
00:47:39,00:47:40,But okay.
00:47:40,00:47:41,Bronzes.
00:47:41,00:47:44,He didn't piss on the kiss.
00:47:44,00:47:46,Sadly not.
00:47:46,00:47:48,"So actually, he just got his helpers to pee on it."
00:47:48,00:47:50,He didn't collect them or anything.
00:47:50,00:47:51,He just said go and piss on them.
00:47:51,00:47:52,"It's a studio, isn't it?"
00:47:52,00:47:53,It's like Damien Hurst.
00:47:53,00:47:56,Damien Hurst often won't piss on his own stuff.
00:47:56,00:47:57,Will he not?
00:47:57,00:47:58,No.
00:47:58,00:47:59,"Yeah, don't piss on your own stuff."
00:47:59,00:48:01,Save that for the critics.
00:48:01,00:48:05,"Well, Vincent van Gogh also used cow urine."
00:48:05,00:48:08,"This color called Indian yellow, which was this huge secret and it came in these balls"
00:48:08,00:48:12,and it was really popular in the 19th century because it's an unbelievably vivid dye and
00:48:12,00:48:16,no one knows how it was made and it was this huge secret and it turns out that this village
00:48:16,00:48:21,"in India called Mirazapur was taking its cows and it was restricting their diet, basically"
00:48:21,00:48:22,only to mango leaves.
00:48:22,00:48:24,"Oh, yeah."
00:48:24,00:48:27,"And there are some claims and counterclaims about it, but there's pretty good evidence"
00:48:27,00:48:31,that it did happen and they would take the cow's piss and they would heat it and they'd
00:48:31,00:48:35,"bake it down to a syrup, basically, dry the syrup so it's ultra pure."
00:48:35,00:48:38,And The Starry Night by Vincent van Gogh.
00:48:38,00:48:39,Cow piss.
00:48:39,00:48:40,"You'll see in cow piss when you see those stars, yeah."
00:48:40,00:48:41,No way.
00:48:41,00:48:42,You should go and stand.
00:48:42,00:48:43,What gallery is it in?
00:48:43,00:48:46,I want someone to go and stand there and just tell everyone who comes and starts admiring
00:48:46,00:48:47,it.
00:48:47,00:48:50,"Cow piss, you know?"
00:48:50,00:48:51,Cow piss.
00:48:51,00:48:53,You can use horse urine to grow pineapples.
00:48:53,00:48:54,Really?
00:48:54,00:48:58,"Which they do at the Lost Gardens of Heligan, which is in Cornwall."
00:48:58,00:49:03,And they still make pineapples in that old way that they used to.
00:49:03,00:49:07,"So, do you remember how we said that you used to be able to buy a pineapple for the same"
00:49:07,00:49:08,price as a car?
00:49:08,00:49:10,"Now, I know what you're going to say."
00:49:10,00:49:11,You got confused.
00:49:11,00:49:13,You thought it was a pineapple.
00:49:13,00:49:19,"Well, when you saw this really big apple devs, was it spiky and didn't have, like, green"
00:49:19,00:49:20,spines?
00:49:20,00:49:23,"It was an open brackets pine, closed brackets apple."
00:49:23,00:49:24,No.
00:49:24,00:49:28,"So, like, pineapples used to be really expensive because they were so expensive to grow in"
00:49:28,00:49:30,the UK because we don't have the climate.
00:49:30,00:49:36,"And so, the Lost Gardens of Heligan in Cornwall still make them in the old-fashioned way."
00:49:36,00:49:40,"And the way that they do that is they get a greenhouse, but they heat up the greenhouse"
00:49:40,00:49:46,"by putting horse manure and horse urine and piles of straw in the corner, and they kind"
00:49:46,00:49:50,"of, like, a compost heat will get hotter and hotter, and that heats up the building hot."
00:49:50,00:49:54,"But it does mean every pineapple costs £1,200 to grow."
00:49:54,00:49:55,That's a lot.
00:49:55,00:49:57,"So, it's a lot of money for one pineapple, isn't it?"
00:49:57,00:49:58,Yeah.
00:49:58,00:50:03,"I reckon that the pineapple that they're growing at the moment, or might have just grown,"
00:50:03,00:50:08,"is going to be worth around £10,000 in total because of not just how much it costs to make,"
00:50:08,00:50:11,but also its rarity and stuff like that.
00:50:11,00:50:14,"But even though it's worth that much, they're not going to sell it, they're going to cut"
00:50:14,00:50:15,it up and feed it to their staff.
00:50:15,00:50:16,Nice.
00:50:16,00:50:17,Wow.
00:50:17,00:50:18,"It's quite nice, isn't it?"
00:50:18,00:50:22,"I did read that when they started doing this, they gave the second one they'd grown to the"
00:50:22,00:50:23,Queen.
00:50:23,00:50:24,I guess great.
00:50:24,00:50:27,But they did make sure that they'd tasted the first one to ensure that they did not
00:50:27,00:50:29,taste of horse urine in horse manure.
00:50:29,00:50:30,Good idea.
00:50:30,00:50:32,That is a risk.
00:50:32,00:50:38,"On urine collection, the first ever people doing IVF, so very early patients."
00:50:38,00:50:40,"This was, when was it, 70s, I think?"
00:50:40,00:50:42,"Well, Louise Brown was 77, I think."
00:50:42,00:50:43,"Oh, OK."
00:50:43,00:50:44,"Yeah, yeah."
00:50:44,00:50:48,"So, the two doctors who were pioneering it really were called Robert Edwards and Patrick"
00:50:48,00:50:53,"Steptoe, and it was really old Steptoe, and it's quite controversial."
00:50:53,00:50:57,"You know, there were a few various kinds, because it was kind of creating life artificially."
00:50:57,00:51:01,"But early patients had to live in the centre, basically, for two or three weeks as inpatients"
00:51:01,00:51:06,"while this was going on, and they had to collect all of their urine during treatment, because"
00:51:06,00:51:08,they needed to monitor their hormone levels.
00:51:08,00:51:12,So they just had to carry these huge plastic containers every time they went offsite.
00:51:12,00:51:16,They did have an amazing pineapple garden rum bag.
00:51:16,00:51:19,"Yeah, it was really, it was really basic stuff."
00:51:19,00:51:23,"And the other thing they had to do was, after your embryos were inserted back into you,"
00:51:23,00:51:26,"the women had to spend an hour or two crouching down with their bottoms in the air, just in"
00:51:26,00:51:28,"case, in case gravity helped."
00:51:28,00:51:30,They weren't sure whether it helped or not.
00:51:30,00:51:31,"Wasn't it the case, by the way?"
00:51:31,00:51:34,"I actually don't have any information on this, but I remember reading that in the early"
00:51:34,00:51:39,"days of penicillin, we didn't have enough penicillin itself to go around for every patient."
00:51:39,00:51:43,"So what they would do is, they would give a patient some of the penicillin and then wait"
00:51:43,00:51:47,"at the other end of them for it to come out through their pee, and they would extract the"
00:51:47,00:51:50,"remaining penicillin that was in there, and then give that to another patient."
00:51:50,00:51:54,Because you would have thought that you have metabolised the useful bits of the penicillin.
00:51:54,00:51:55,"Oh, yeah, that's the point."
00:51:55,00:51:56,"It's diluting, and diluting, and diluting."
00:51:56,00:51:59,But I guess you've maybe got enough left over in it that it's worth extracting from
00:51:59,00:52:00,the pee.
00:52:00,00:52:02,That's really gross.
00:52:02,00:52:08,I was reading an article which said that action must be taken over the surprisingly widespread
00:52:08,00:52:12,problem of stable staff urinating into race horses' bedding.
00:52:12,00:52:15,I saw that.
00:52:15,00:52:16,Did you?
00:52:16,00:52:17,Yeah.
00:52:17,00:52:18,And what's the problem?
00:52:18,00:52:21,"Oh, it's just horrible for the horses, because they've got a bed covered in groom piss."
00:52:21,00:52:24,"Well, the last problem, the problem is the testing."
00:52:24,00:52:25,"No, it is a problem."
00:52:25,00:52:26,It's bad for the horses.
00:52:26,00:52:31,"You don't want to lie them down on sort of wet, damp hay or straw."
00:52:31,00:52:32,Horses sleep on their urine a lot.
00:52:32,00:52:33,They should be mucked out.
00:52:33,00:52:35,"They should be, you know."
00:52:35,00:52:37,"But when you muck out the horses, hey, you're going to muck out the human urine with the"
00:52:37,00:52:39,"horse urine, aren't you?"
00:52:39,00:52:43,"I also think, though, if I, you know, got the bed, ever wet the bed, I don't want other"
00:52:43,00:52:46,"people coming pissing on my bed going, ""Well, you've already done it, so I might as well"
00:52:46,00:52:47,"as well."""
00:52:47,00:52:48,Exactly.
00:52:48,00:52:49,"Do you think it's, well, it probably is worse."
00:52:49,00:52:51,"Like, your own fart smell okay, but someone else is already horrible."
00:52:51,00:52:57,"And it's like, it'd be less, ""I don't really want to sleep on my own wet bed, but I would"
00:52:57,00:53:01,"rather do that if it was a choice between that and the bed that Andy's pissed in."""
00:53:01,00:53:02,Thank you.
00:53:02,00:53:03,Sure.
00:53:03,00:53:04,Yeah.
00:53:04,00:53:05,Great.
00:53:05,00:53:06,Exactly.
00:53:06,00:53:07,Yeah.
00:53:07,00:53:08,"No, I thought they were saying it was for the horse's benefit, but you're saying it's"
00:53:08,00:53:10,also for the problem of doping.
00:53:10,00:53:11,The reason it came up.
00:53:11,00:53:13,Because grooms are all coked off their heads.
00:53:13,00:53:15,The reason it came up is because the grooms are all coked off their heads.
00:53:15,00:53:17,But they don't test the straw.
00:53:17,00:53:18,"Yeah, they do."
00:53:18,00:53:19,What?
00:53:19,00:53:20,They test the straw?
00:53:20,00:53:23,"You'll do the testing by testing the horse's straw, because that's where you get the horse"
00:53:23,00:53:24,ear and fork.
00:53:24,00:53:26,So the bedding will get tested as a sample.
00:53:26,00:53:29,"And there's a trainer whose horse was found to have been sort of doping, but I think with"
00:53:29,00:53:32,"something that you wouldn't dop with like marijuana or something, I can't remember"
00:53:32,00:53:33,actually what it was.
00:53:33,00:53:34,Right.
00:53:34,00:53:38,But it turned out to be caused by the stable staff urinating in the box while he was mucking
00:53:38,00:53:39,it out.
00:53:39,00:53:41,This horse has been asking a lot of big questions about the universe.
00:53:41,00:53:44,"They seem to have a lot of jazz, I don't know."
00:53:44,00:53:51,"OK, that's it."
00:53:51,00:53:52,That's all of our facts.
00:53:52,00:53:54,Thank you so much for listening.
