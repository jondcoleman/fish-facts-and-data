00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish!

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:13.200
 Andrew Hunter Murray is off on his hollybops, sailing the seven seas, looking for new unbeknownst

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.520
 species of moss and while he is away, we have got a guest for you and that guest is none

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.960
 other than Anne Miller.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.880
 Of course you know Anne, she's one of the QIL, she's a really good friend of ours and

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.680
 it's great to have her back.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.800
 One thing you really need to know about Anne especially in these weeks upcoming to Christmas

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.000
 is that she is also a published author, she has written a series of children's books,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.800
 they are known as Mickey and the Animal Spies, they're known as that because that is their

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.760
 name and they're absolutely brilliant, my daughter absolutely loves looking at the pictures

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.800
 and I'm sure when she gets to the right age she will enjoy reading them as well.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.800
 While we're on the subject of books, of course it would be remiss of me not to mention our

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.680
 book, Mine and Anna's new book, Everything to Play for the QI Book of Sport, definitely

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.640
 buy that for your loved ones for Christmas, anyone who likes sport, definitely buy it

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.640
 for them.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.880
 If you don't like sport but you like what we do, I promise you'll love this book because

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.400
 it's full of loads of interesting human stories, drama, it's the ultimate sports book for people

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.360
 who don't really like sports and also people who do like sports will like it as well.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.240
 It's for everyone, that's the great thing about our book but then that also has to be

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.440
 true of Andy and Dan's books, you definitely should go and get those as well.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.880
 Dan's book is called The Theory of Everything Else, it's a brilliant look into his brain,

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.640
 his unique brain let's say but he's looked at the history of people who had done otherwise

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.280
 great things but deep down they had a dark secret of believing some weird shit and speaking

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.920
 of weird shit you should also have a look at Andy's books, Andrew Hunter Murray he has

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.640
 two books they're called The Sanctuary and The Last Day, they're both brilliant acerbic

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.000
 dystopian books that tell you something about the modern day while thrilling you with an

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.440
 incredible story about the future, they're absolutely amazing, you've got to get those

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.440
 as well.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.960
 Basically what I'm saying is who doesn't love a book for Christmas and there's a ton

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.160
 of them made by your favourite QILs that are all available online and mine and as Dan's

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.180
 and Andy's you can find at noteswiththingsafish.com/books.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.400
 One more very very important thing I need to say before I leave you in peace to listen

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.760
 to the podcast is that we do have a couple of live shows coming up just before Christmas,

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.120
 they will take place in London on Thursday the 7th of Friday the 8th of December at the

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.320
 Soho Theatre, now we've already mentioned this to the clubfish members and I think it's

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.960
 been on social media so the truth is there are not many tickets left.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:45.300
 If you do want to come and see this show, literally pause now and go to noteswiththingsafish.com/live,

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.980
 click on the link and check if there are any tickets left, you never know sometimes extra

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.060
 tickets do come up closer to the date so do go and check there anyway and hopefully see

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.380
 some of you there for our Christmas shows.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.820
 Anyway thank you so much for getting to the end of this without fast forwarding, if you

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.220
 have fast forwarded and got to here without hearing the last bit, shame on you.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.060
 But anyway it's time for our podcast with Anmela so there is nothing more to say apart

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:16.360
 from on with the podcast!

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:32.640
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.060
 to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.860
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, James Harkin and Ann

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.960
 Miller and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.500
 from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go!

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.500
 Starting with fact number one and that is Anna.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:58.580
 My fact this week is that a list of adorable things written over a thousand years ago includes

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:04.560
 chicks who look like their clothes are too big for them and faces drawn on melons.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:13.120
 Can I ask for definitions of chicks and melons because I live in the 1990s.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.400
 Right, both chicks and melons mean what they've meant in every decade outside of the 1990s.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:29.220
 I'm afraid, baby chickens and fruit.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.620
 People are writing about adorable things a thousand years ago, that's weird.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.100
 I actually heard this reference on radio for this week so I'm sure there are people who

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.100
 also heard it mentioned it.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:44.060
 It's the pillow book which is this extraordinary book written by a woman in Japan in the tenth

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:52.880
 century and the Haiyan period and that's why we chose this.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:05:00.240
 God, it took me a long time to find a Haiyan period.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:07.440
 Anyway, this woman basically wrote a diary of just random stuff that popped into her

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.180
 head of lists and observations and things she thought should happen and shouldn't happen

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.120
 and things people should wear and shouldn't wear and one of them was his list of really

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.880
 cute things and one of them was faces drawn on melons, one of them was chicks who look

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.560
 like their clothes are too big which I think is like if you see a chick but its feathers

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.880
 look like they're a bit swollen, you know they look like they look like you dress them

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:30.880
 up in human clothes.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:31.880
 That's what I thought.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:32.880
 That's cute.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:33.880
 That would be even cuter.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.960
 From what I could tell from interpretations of it, I think they're just talking about

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.480
 chicks who look like they don't fit into their clothes yet.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.480
 Right.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.480
 They're too small.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.040
 That's slightly less cute than like a hat and dungarees.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.840
 Well, take it up with, say, Shonagun, the author of this book, maybe she hadn't thought

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:49.840
 of that.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.700
 The good thing about this book is, and I'm sure you all found this reading it, it's

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.980
 just like someone is writing today, isn't it?

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:55.980
 Yeah.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:56.980
 It's just like this cute thing.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:01.380
 So one is a young palace page, obviously that's not the thing anymore, but a young

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:07.200
 palace page who is still quite small and walks by in ceremonial costume and that's just

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:12.360
 like if you go to a wedding and you see a little toddler, a page boy in a suit.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.360
 Yeah.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.360
 It's true.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.360
 But it's not all happy stuff, is it?

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.120
 There's so many great pissed off lists, things like things that are unpleasant to hear, someone

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.840
 who has an ugly voice yet speaks and laughs without restraint, so she has a list for that.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.960
 She has a list for things that give a pathetic impression.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:33.560
 The voice of someone who blows his nose while he is speaking, the impression of a woman

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.280
 plucking her eyebrows, it's all so odd.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.800
 My favourite random one in there is the list of extremely frightening things, do you guys

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:42.800
 know?

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:43.800
 No, I didn't see that.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:48.400
 It's thunder, yeah, fair enough, and I just enjoy this one, extremely frightening thing,

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:53.640
 when a thief has entered the house next door, one is extremely frightened.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:07:01.800
 If he breaks into the house where one is actually living, if he breaks into the house where one

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:07.240
 is actually living, one loses consciousness and knows nothing more, which is true.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.240
 That's true.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.720
 So I think some of these, they sound like stand up routines.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:11.720
 Yeah, exactly.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:15.240
 It's like, I've found one which is things that are infuriating, which sounds like it's

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:19.800
 like a Josh Whittacum routine, it says, "This is what's infuriating.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.920
 Someone suddenly falls ill and an exorcist is sent for.

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:27.040
 They don't find him in the usual place and a tedious amount of time is spent waiting

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.280
 while they go around in search of him.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.800
 Finally, they manage to locate him and with great relief, you see him to performing the

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.120
 exorcism rites.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:39.800
 However, the recent exertions of exercising some other possessive spirit seems to have

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.800
 worn him out.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:45.640
 For no sooner does he sit down and start in on the chanting than his spirit seems to

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:51.040
 have worn him out, his voice goes drowsy, and that is utterly infuriating."

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.040
 I think.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.040
 It's so relatable, isn't it?

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.040
 Yeah.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.040
 My note for Josh may be broad, isn't it?

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.040
 A tiny bit.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.040
 I like the idea this is a, "Hey, what about airplane food?"

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.040
 It clearly is.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.040
 There's a list.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.040
 Rare things.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.360
 A silver tweezer that is good at plucking out the hair.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.360
 This is today.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.360
 It is.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.920
 You can't get tweezers that pluck out hairs well.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.960
 How have they not designed this in the last thousand years?

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.560
 It's basically shots of miscellany, isn't it?

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:21.980
 Because it is list, but it's also essays sometimes, or diaries, yeah, diary entries, observations.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:25.720
 So this is, just to put it into the period, I know everyone probably knows the years of

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:33.500
 the high Anne period, but we're talking the year 1000 is what's going on here.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:37.880
 And at the time that she was writing this book, Beowulf was being written also, just

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:40.440
 to put in context the other great pieces of literature.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.440
 Not nearly as relatable, Beowulf.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.440
 No.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.440
 No, that's true.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.440
 I haven't actually read it, so I...

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.520
 Well, the first word in it, we still don't know what it means.

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.520
 Really?

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:49.520
 I think so.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.520
 Wow.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.520
 Really?

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:52.520
 Yeah.

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:53.520
 Do you say the word?

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.520
 Do you know it?

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:55.520
 It's like, "What?"

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.520
 Yeah.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.520
 And she was, so she was working in the court of the empress at the time.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:04.240
 She was like a lady-in-waiting who was always there, and she basically wrote this book because

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.080
 she just had a lot of spare time with nothing to do.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.800
 So she never intended it for publication.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.880
 It was just a personal book that she was writing.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.360
 We don't even properly know her name.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:19.520
 So she's called, say, Seanagun, but that's, Seanagun is the title that you're given.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.080
 It's a minor counselor.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:25.320
 And "say" is the name that was added later, which refers to her father's name, so you

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:29.320
 can distinguish her from the other Seanaguns who were in part of the court.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:34.160
 So do we think it could be Josh Whittacum gone back in time to the Haiyan period?

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.600
 It's possible.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.600
 Say Seanagun.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.160
 Does that sound like a Japanese version of Josh Whittacum?

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.160
 Yeah.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.160
 That's what I was thinking.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:45.280
 The word "haiyan" means "peace" in Japanese, because it was particularly, it was quite

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:48.960
 long period, and it was a time where there wasn't much war going on, so people had time

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.160
 to write these stand-up routines.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.160
 That's why she was so bored.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.560
 I reckon she craved a war.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.880
 Do we think she was a bit of a bitch?

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:57.880
 Was she?

00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:58.880
 What?

00:09:58.880 --> 00:09:59.880
 Well, I mean, just from what she writes.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:00.880
 I mean, like, adorable things.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:01.880
 Give us some examples.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:02.880
 I mean, the...

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.880
 Pretty much, list your reading.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:04.880
 Yeah, you're right.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:05.880
 I think she had mean qualities.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:10.640
 In fact, there was a story about her where one of her neighbor's houses burned down and

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.280
 they lost everything they owned.

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:15.080
 The fire in the house next door is the most scary thing.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.080
 That guy wasn't in her house.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:22.440
 Well, I don't know how scary she was finding it, because basically she wrote a kind of

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.200
 little note mocking this person.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.200
 Right.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.200
 He's lost everything.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.960
 He's standing outside his house, you know, naked, and gives it to her mum and says, "Hey,

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.600
 go give this note, taking the piss out of this guy to him."

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.600
 Okay.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:37.080
 She had what was effectively a lot of people claim was a rival.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:43.680
 I don't think we fully know that, but it is someone who is friend of the podcast, Murasaki

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:49.240
 Chikibu, who wrote, and we mentioned in episode 63 of Fish, The Tale of Genji.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.240
 The Tale of Genji.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:54.860
 Yeah, the first ever novel, which finished mid-sentence, right, like it just cuts off.

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:59.960
 What happened was is that Sei Shonagun was working for this empress, and at the time

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.200
 it was one emperor, one empress, that's how it worked, but they bucked the trend with

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.400
 this one, and suddenly she was no longer the exclusive empress.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:11.360
 So he got married again, and the lady-in-waiting who became the lady-in-waiting for the next

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.080
 lady was this person, The Tale of Genji.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.080
 No way.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.080
 Yeah.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:20.360
 So that's why they were kind of like in rival land, according to certain historians.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:27.640
 So that book, The Tale of Genji by Murasaki, has a word, kawayushi, which is the word which

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:33.880
 turned into the modern-day word, kawaii, which means cute in Japanese.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:39.560
 And this idea of, you know, lots of cute animals, and, you know, Hello Kitty and all that kind

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:40.840
 of stuff.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:45.480
 This is kind of a 20th century thing that we're not sure exactly, there's lots of reasons

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:49.840
 why it might have come about, but possibly a reaction to the war, to the bombs, stuff

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:50.840
 like that.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:55.040
 People wanted to go from the horrors of war to cuteness, but definitely seems to have

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:58.120
 become popular when mechanical pencils came out.

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:03.360
 So you know those pencils that kind of, you know, you twist them and the blood comes out.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.360
 Twist them?

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:05.360
 Do you not click them?

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.720
 Or the one where you take the little one out and put it in the top?

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.200
 Do you remember them from Proud Boys' Girl?

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.200
 There's so many different ones.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.640
 Hang on, you have to, there's a little pocket containing this.

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:17.480
 Inside the, where like the leg would go, there were like tiny little things and you pop one

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:20.840
 out of the bottom and pop it in the top to save you from opening your pencil.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:23.440
 I hated them all because they write so horribly, so...

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:29.480
 Well, they were very popular in 1970s Japan, where you would not have fit in.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:34.680
 Because they could write very, very thin lines and it inspired a kind of writing among teenage

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:39.080
 girls where they would put like lots of little hearts and little, you know, characters and

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:46.360
 stuff in their writing and it was so popular and it made the writing so difficult to read

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.000
 that it was banned in loads of schools.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 Right.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.720
 Basically, you weren't allowed to write in this kawai style, but by then the trend had

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:53.720
 already taken off.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:57.000
 I guess once you've started doing it, it sort of becomes your hand, like there were some

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.360
 people who would do like proper circles over their eye or like little hearts.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.360
 And I was like, "Why?

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.360
 It takes a little bit longer!"

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:07.040
 I was just going to ask, "And were you a heart to blow the eye?"

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:10.040
 I barely dot my eyes!

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.040
 Your eyes are just a line.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.840
 You don't have time for that dot.

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:14.840
 And but it's not...

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:20.440
 I was reading a sort of paper on it saying it's not as cutesy as maybe our version of

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.560
 cute, like it's got a bit of an edge, so...

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:24.560
 The kawaii cute.

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:25.560
 The kawaii cute, yeah.

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:29.400
 The Japanese cute, which you can kind of see, there's sometimes a bit of a dark edginess

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.400
 to it.

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:35.400
 There's a character called Gloomy the Naughty Grizzly, who I hadn't come across, but apparently

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.520
 that's a big cultural phenomenon.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:42.800
 And he's a two meter tall, like cuddly bear, but he's very violent.

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.880
 He's covered in blood quite a lot of the time.

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.800
 He attacks his owner quite a lot.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:51.560
 And that's kawaii in Japan, but not necessarily something we would say was cute.

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:55.800
 I think that's like Kimo kawaii, so it's like grotesque and cute at the same time.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.680
 I think that's what they call it.

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:02.600
 And yeah, obviously they have loads of mascots, don't they, in Japan.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:08.260
 In 2015, the governor of Osaka complained that he couldn't recognise most of his prefectures

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:09.260
 mascots.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:10.760
 They had 92 of them.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:11.760
 Wow.

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.280
 In Osaka alone.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.760
 And he ordered a cull.

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:20.080
 And 20 of his characters were - oh, wow.

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:22.280
 Murdered by the grizzly bear.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:23.760
 Public executions, I hope.

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:29.580
 He made a list, like, 20 mascots that really annoy me, and then I - yeah.

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:31.460
 It's amazing how successful it was, though.

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:35.340
 You know how, when governments try to be cool, you know, like David Cameron saying he sports

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:38.160
 Aston Villa or whatever, and it's just massive cringe.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:42.640
 But the Japanese government, basically in the '90s, did, like, cool Japan, which was

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:48.720
 a bit like we had cool Britannia here, and cool Japan was the idea of exporting all this

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:49.720
 Japanese cultural stuff.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:52.920
 And they don't know how they did it, but they nailed it, because it's so popular now, isn't

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:53.920
 it?

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:56.320
 You get people who are really into manga, really into those styles.

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.760
 Hello Kitty is a global phenomenon.

00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:58.760
 Hello Kitty.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:03.060
 Well, like in the cool Britannia was like Blair versus Oasis, and do you think in Japan

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:06.680
 now kids are listening to what's a starry morning glory?

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:07.680
 Yeah.

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:08.680
 Oh, yeah.

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:09.680
 It's still Blair and Oasis.

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:10.680
 Is it?

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:11.680
 Yeah, yeah.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:12.680
 It's not resolved.

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:13.680
 Yeah.

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:14.680
 Hang on, but are Blair and Oasis popular there?

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:15.680
 I think it's now.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:16.680
 It's not by saying that.

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:17.680
 Not anymore.

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.000
 Damn, it'd be great if they were, because that would be my cultural homeland.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.780
 That's when I stopped learning about pop music, was it about 1998?

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:26.180
 Yeah, wouldn't it be great if there was, like, a little museum somewhere where you could

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:31.680
 go, and they're still listening to all your kind of, it's called, smoother fans.

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:33.320
 Blair Oasis.

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:35.840
 Oh, God.

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:38.020
 Cuteness is a funny thing, isn't it?

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.960
 And we are the cutest of the primates.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.720
 So that's nice for us.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:43.720
 Officials.

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:44.720
 We're self-proclaimed.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:45.720
 Officials.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:48.000
 I guess it is self-proclaimed, because we're the only ones who can write about it.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.520
 We're any of the bonobos allowed to vote in this?

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:51.760
 Screw you, gorillas.

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:52.760
 You can't read.

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.120
 You can't define what's cute.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:59.340
 You know, what's kind of defined as cute is the traits that are common in infants.

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:03.220
 And that is, it was actually defined by this guy called Conrad Lorenz, who won a Nobel

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:04.220
 Prize.

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:09.940
 It's called the Kinder Schema, and it's a large brain capsule, as he puts it, big forehead,

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:11.380
 I think we'll call it.

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:17.340
 Large and low-lying eyes, bulging cheeks, short and thick extremities, a springy elastic

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:21.660
 consistency and clumsy movements, which is, like, the ugliest way to describe what is

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:22.660
 actually a really cute image.

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:23.660
 Oh, yeah, image.

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:27.280
 Oh, wasn't there, there was a thing I read a while ago about, about animals who found

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:30.400
 those cute, like an elephant, like caressing people, and they think, like, oh, you're just

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.400
 so cute and small.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:32.400
 It was really lovely.

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:36.320
 I don't know if I want to be caressed by an elephant, you know, of all the animals that

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.320
 could caress me.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:38.320
 It may not.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.320
 I think there's an elephant.

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:40.320
 I feel like I have a trunk involved.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.320
 That sounds likely.

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.360
 They're quite empathetic elephants, aren't they?

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:47.640
 One of the scariest things is an elephant caressing next door's baby.

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:50.640
 Absolutely terrifying.

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:57.060
 There was a study done in 2009, and this was, they gave people a load of cute images, and

00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:59.620
 then they asked them to play the game Operation.

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:03.860
 So you know where you have, like, a plastic body, and you have to pull out the funny bone

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:05.900
 and stuff so that it doesn't buzz.

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:09.980
 Well it turned out that anyone who'd been exposed to high cuteness stimuli was better

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:10.980
 at Operation.

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:11.980
 Ah.

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:15.780
 So first of all, a tip for Christmas, if you go home and someone's got Operation, have

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:19.580
 a quick look at some kawaii stuff before you play, and it'll help.

00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:23.960
 But secondly, it's due to extreme carefulness, and the idea is you've seen lots of cute things,

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:27.840
 you want to look after them almost, and you want to be more careful.

00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:28.840
 Right.

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:32.000
 But don't look at the bloodied bear, because that might give you the impression that blood

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.800
 all over your Operation human is going to be...

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:35.800
 Adorable.

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:36.800
 Adorable.

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:39.720
 You heard, like, 4D operation as a kid, damn, that'd be all blood.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.760
 Are you guys in use of all blood?

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:42.760
 Oh my God.

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:53.940
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anne.

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:58.620
 My fact is that the Viperfish has teeth that are so long it can't close its mouth properly

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:00.420
 or it would impale its own brain.

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:01.420
 Hmm.

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:03.940
 I bet there are a few that have, though.

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:08.020
 Yeah, the idiot kids, the Darwin-award Viperfish.

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:09.020
 Exactly.

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:12.340
 But so have they sort of evolved, like, the equivalent of a doorstopper?

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:13.340
 They have.

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:16.000
 So basically, they're very, like, very long and silver, and they've got these lighty-up

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.140
 spots along the bottom of their stomach, and then they have these huge teeth that kind

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:24.800
 of pierce upwards from their jaw, and luckily it doesn't impede their hunting, because to

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:28.920
 hunt it basically just swims around with its mouth open until it finds prey.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:32.680
 It can unhinge its jaw and rotate its skull, so when it finds prey it just basically swims

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:36.520
 straight at it, and then it clamps its teeth shut like a cage and holds them in its mouth

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:37.520
 and then eats them.

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:38.520
 Hmm.

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:39.520
 It can close its mouth, so...

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:43.120
 The teeth are coming out, so it's like making a seal, so they're kind of like having a very

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.120
 extreme overbite.

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:49.240
 Yeah, because I know there's another fish called the common fangtooth, which, as its

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:54.240
 name might suggest, has fangy teeth, and what they have is they have special sockets on

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:58.120
 either side of their brain so that when they close their mouth, their teeth go into those

00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:59.120
 sockets.

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:00.120
 Well, that is nice.

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.120
 Isn't that amazing?

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.120
 Yeah.

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:03.120
 It's so precise with the pockets.

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.460
 I think, like, if you got punched in the jaw and that was slightly dislocated, the first

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:09.480
 time you tried to shut your mouth, it would then miss the holes and pierce you in the

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:10.480
 brain.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:11.480
 That would be...

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:12.980
 That's why there's no boxing in the fangtooth community.

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:13.980
 I think that's correct.

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:14.980
 Yeah.

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:18.440
 But Biprofish is really cool, so as well as being able to get its prey in this cage, it

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:22.320
 can expand its stomach, so it can swallow prey that's 50% bigger than itself.

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.320
 Oh, wow.

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.320
 Which is so cool.

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:25.320
 That's amazing.

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:28.480
 So I just think whenever you say, "Oh, I can eat my own body size of this," he can.

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:29.480
 Yeah.

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:31.680
 Very unsuttle, though, if you're invited to a dinner party, and you know sometimes you

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:34.960
 have a meal before you go and you just fake it and say, "No, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah,

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:35.960
 it's not a big deal."

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:36.960
 It's not a big deal.

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:37.960
 You actually really feel, can't hide that.

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:42.460
 You've got 50% more body weight coming through the door.

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:43.460
 Goldfish.

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:44.460
 Oh, yeah.

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:45.460
 Have teeth.

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:46.460
 Can't believe it.

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:48.500
 How do you think they eat?

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:51.980
 I just thought they swallowed things that didn't need chewing.

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:53.460
 Well, they eat like little fishy flakes.

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:54.460
 They're not.

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:55.460
 Yeah, I thought it was like...

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:56.460
 They kind of dissolve in the water.

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:59.500
 Yeah, if you open their mouth, you can't see it, but the teeth are at the back of the

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:00.500
 throat.

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.900
 They just have a set of teeth that do all the old crunching.

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:04.500
 Yeah, right at the back.

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:08.520
 Yeah, that'll often happen, and I always think, "How does that do contract your throat as

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:09.520
 a fish?"

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:10.520
 Because lots of fish have it, don't they?

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:11.520
 There's teeth in the throat thing.

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:12.520
 Yeah.

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:13.520
 It seems like it'd be very uncomfortable.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:17.120
 But what's really cool is if you have goldfish at home right now, go and have a look in your

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:20.200
 little aquarium that you have.

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:24.440
 Look at the bottom, because what they'll do is they often lose teeth and they grow new

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:28.400
 ones, and so either you can catch your goldfish in the act of literally spitting its tooth

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:31.280
 out, or look at the bottom, there'll be little teeth.

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:34.320
 You should say how often they do, because I worry that someone's going to sit in front

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:37.020
 of their goldfish tank staring at it for days on end, waiting.

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:39.540
 Every seven minutes.

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:45.340
 If you have a pet Pacific Link card, then you might be able to do that, because they

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:48.180
 gain and lose, on average, 20 teeth every day.

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:49.180
 What?

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:54.460
 Yeah, so every day, 20 of the teeth fall out, and 20 new ones grow in the place.

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:55.460
 Amazing.

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:57.940
 They are also probably too big for your fish tank, aren't they?

00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:59.340
 I think they're about five feet long.

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:00.340
 Oh, they are.

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:01.700
 They're obviously on the size of your fish tank.

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:06.520
 They could fit in my pond, if they kind of sped themselves in half.

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:09.960
 Have you seen the really horrible sheep's head fish?

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:12.820
 If you haven't seen it, google it, but it is pretty gross.

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:13.820
 Wow.

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:17.700
 Basically you've got just human teeth, it's like a big gummy smile, it's very unpleasant.

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:21.280
 And it's not nice human teeth, it's sort of like someone who hasn't cleaned their teeth

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.280
 for 20 years.

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:27.160
 It's really disconcerting when you see a fish that doesn't have the face of a fish.

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:30.260
 If anyone, I don't know if it's still there, I don't know the lifespan, but about seven

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:34.620
 years ago, I was in a restaurant in Bow Road, in a Chinese restaurant, they had an aquarium,

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:36.900
 and there was a fish there with a face of a dog.

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:38.940
 It just had a dog's head.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:40.940
 It was the weirdest thing.

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:44.460
 Is this one of those restaurants where you go in and you choose the fish, you want them

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:45.460
 to cook?

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:47.500
 Because I reckon if it is, it probably is still there.

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:52.200
 I'll have the dog face, please.

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:56.100
 To be fair, it is possible that maybe a dog was looking through the other side of the

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:57.100
 tank.

00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:00.060
 Was it a fellow diner's pet?

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:03.060
 You can see fish that have human looking teeth as well.

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:04.060
 What's it called?

00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:05.060
 The Paku?

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:06.060
 Paku.

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:07.060
 You mean as well as the one that Anne's mentioned.

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:08.060
 Oh, is that the Paku one?

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:09.060
 Mine's a sheep's head fish.

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:11.060
 It's called Sheep's Head, but that might be their official name.

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:14.920
 There are more fish than you would think with human looking teeth, but the one that scared

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:17.500
 me the most, I didn't know dogs could have teeth on their beaks.

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.780
 You see the Goosander dog?

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:22.780
 Not only that, he lives in the UK, they're everywhere, and they're terrified of this

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:23.780
 dog.

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:26.860
 That would be a great animated cartoon for Loosanders to do.

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:31.180
 You've got the Goosanders, which say, "Shonigan, Joshua Witticombe," and Goosanders.

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:33.620
 Looking up this line up really well.

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:35.900
 I was thinking, "Oh, what did you see in the park?

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:36.900
 Goosander duck?"

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:37.900
 Oh, really?

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:38.900
 Two things.

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:42.180
 Just the one with all the teeth.

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:47.540
 The Paku we mentioned a few seconds ago, they supposedly combined human testicles off.

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:49.660
 They're invasive.

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:54.860
 I think you get them in Papua New Guinea or somewhere, and they have come into the Northern

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:59.100
 Hemisphere more recently, and whenever they catch one, it's always in the news it's like

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:03.100
 testicle-biting fish in the Thames or whatever.

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:04.100
 Oh, really?

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:05.100
 I think it's not true.

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:12.860
 They're vegetarian, so they eat nuts, and the story goes that someone with particularly

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:17.300
 nut-like testicles was standing by the water in Papua New Guinea.

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:21.700
 That's the swollen balls that person has got if they've got the consistency of a nut.

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:22.700
 It depends what kind of nut.

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:25.420
 Are there any nuts that are as soft as testicles out there?

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:29.860
 No, this does sound like one incident, and it's similar to a man going to a hospital

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:35.000
 saying, "I don't know how my penis got inside this vacuum cleaner, but..."

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:41.660
 It's an invasive species of Henry Hoover's who supposedly eat penises.

00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:43.300
 I think there's a little bit of that.

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:47.340
 I think there was one story of some people in Papua New Guinea, and one person possibly

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:53.140
 had the genitals bitten by this fish, and it has since kind of...

00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:55.180
 But what was he doing with that fish?

00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:57.180
 He was urinating by the side of the lake.

00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:58.180
 Yeah, right.

00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:01.300
 There was a scary story about a fish that would swim up your urine stream.

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:02.300
 Was that real?

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:03.300
 No.

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:04.300
 No.

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:05.300
 I feel like they're not.

00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:06.300
 Can we just establish it?

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:09.300
 There's a big difference, and I feel like tabloids often do this as well in headlines.

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:13.700
 Then you read the text, and James, you may have just done it between bitten and bitten

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:19.500
 off, and I think it's much less scary to have something bite your arm than to have it bite

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:20.500
 off your arm, for instance.

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:21.500
 Yeah.

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:22.980
 Same with testicles, I would argue as well.

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:23.980
 Yeah, probably it's the same.

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:28.100
 I think what I'm saying is that there was a very small little nibble on this man's

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:29.100
 genitals.

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:30.100
 And it has since...

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:31.100
 And it made the national news.

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:32.100
 Yeah.

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:33.100
 It's snowballed into...

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:34.100
 Since...

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:36.500
 Whenever the paku comes to town, everyone's like, "That's the ball eating fish."

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:40.140
 The other option is that he was bit on the balls by a human and had to quickly come up

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:44.340
 with an excuse for his wife and went, "No, it was the fish that has human teeth."

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:47.900
 It's called the sheep's head.

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:52.500
 Because someone's human has bitten his balls, he's gone, "No, no, it was a fish."

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:54.780
 And she's like, "Well, you can see the teeth marks."

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:55.780
 They're human.

00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:56.780
 They're clearly human teeth.

00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:57.780
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:24:57.780 --> 00:24:58.780
 The paku.

00:24:58.780 --> 00:24:59.780
 It's the paku.

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:00.780
 No, I know you're having an affair.

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:05.580
 You're having an affair with someone who gives a very bad blow to us.

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:09.500
 I was reading about a different type of mouths that fish can have.

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:12.220
 You can have a superior mouth or an inferior mouth.

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:13.220
 Okay.

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:14.220
 What's your criteria?

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:15.220
 That is...

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:16.220
 Can you guess what it is?

00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:17.220
 A superior and an inferior.

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:18.220
 One's on top of your head, I suppose?

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:19.220
 On top of your head?

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:21.820
 Well, because if it's superior, I feel like it's on the top.

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:25.100
 How many fish have you seen where the mouth is above the eyes?

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:26.100
 Oh, look.

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:27.100
 We've said that...

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:28.700
 I bet there are some fish where the mouth is above the eyes.

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:29.700
 That was an upside-down fish.

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:30.700
 Turn it around.

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:32.740
 It was my dead goldfish.

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:33.740
 Is it?

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:36.180
 You're more or less there in fairness.

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:43.380
 A superior mouth is basically imagine a smiling fish and imagine a frowning fish for an inferior

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:44.380
 mouth.

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:45.820
 Oh, so it's like whether it turns up or down.

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:46.820
 Yeah, precisely.

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:50.580
 And if you have a superior mouth and you're a smiling fish, then you usually would feed

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:51.580
 on the surface.

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:53.580
 So you might get insects from the surface of the water.

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:56.140
 Oh, so you're turning your spoon around to go up or go down.

00:25:56.140 --> 00:26:00.380
 And if you're an inferior mouth, you're probably a bottom feeder, as in you're getting stuff

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:01.900
 off the floor.

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:05.900
 And they have terminal mouths like goldfish, which is just at the front.

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:09.180
 So it's neither a smile nor a frown, and they're usually omnivores.

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:10.540
 They'll eat all sorts of stuff.

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:11.540
 Oh, that's funny.

00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:14.300
 It's quite interesting that if you look at a fish and you see whether it's smiling or

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:15.780
 frowning, you can tell how it eats.

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:16.900
 Maybe you can't tell their mood.

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:17.900
 No, you can't.

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:20.900
 Because imagine if you're a really grumpy, pessimistic fish, but you've got the superior

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:23.500
 mouth and you're like, "Everyone thinks I'm so jolly.

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:25.500
 I'm having the worst day."

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:29.780
 We've never had anybody talk about gnarls before.

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:30.780
 Oh, yeah.

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:33.780
 And they're a toothed whale.

00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:34.780
 Count as a toothed whale.

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:35.780
 That's one big tooth.

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:36.780
 Yeah.

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:37.780
 It's where they think unicorns.

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:39.140
 The idea for unicorns came from.

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:43.060
 They found these narwhal tusks and they were like, "Wow, this must be from a horse."

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:44.060
 Okay, right.

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:46.980
 But not only is it one big tooth, it's their only tooth.

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:50.020
 And it's actually their left tooth.

00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:53.300
 It's their left canine.

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:56.900
 So they all have a right canine that doesn't erupt in their mouth.

00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:00.080
 In fact, occasionally you'll see an arwhal where its right one is erupted and it's got

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:02.580
 a double horn thing going on.

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:03.580
 Yeah, right on.

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:04.580
 That's cool.

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:06.300
 So do the males have really long ones?

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:08.180
 Yeah, females tend not to have them actually.

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:09.180
 Really?

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:10.180
 At all.

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:13.240
 And what's the, do we know what sort of like the evolutionary reason for them retaining

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:14.240
 just one?

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:16.280
 I think if males have them, it feels like it's sexual selection.

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:17.280
 It does.

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:20.320
 But again, bizarrely, given they're quite prominent, we really don't know.

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:21.700
 And they've looked at lots of things.

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:27.340
 They thought maybe they use it as an ice pick or as a tool for echolocation and...

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:31.740
 Or sort of like a cocktail steak for, you know, how you put sausages and pineapples on and

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:32.740
 cheese and so on.

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:36.060
 And then only for catering, because if it was on your tooth, you couldn't get it in

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:37.060
 your mouth.

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:38.060
 That's true.

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:39.900
 But you'd not bring it to the mate that you're trying to...

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:42.100
 Oh yeah, like what I've got for you.

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:46.980
 Do you think that's sexy, Dan, if your partner has a really long tooth and you attach some

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:49.940
 pineapple and cheese on and feed it directly into your mouth?

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:52.000
 Is that what, what does it for you?

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 That is right.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.500
 You know she's got that.

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:59.920
 You've not signed up to my only friend, so I thought you, is that the biggest tooth in

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:00.920
 nature?

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:02.620
 Oh, it is big.

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:03.620
 How long can they get to?

00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:05.740
 I feel like they can get to a couple of metres, can't they?

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:07.820
 I think, yeah, I reckon it must be.

00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:09.540
 It's about half their body length.

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:11.100
 Yeah, 'cause tusks are not teeth.

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:13.380
 Tusks are catering, catering, no.

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:14.380
 Caratine?

00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:15.380
 Caratine.

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:16.380
 Caratine.

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:20.180
 You're gonna have a word with my drug dealer.

00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:23.340
 It's doing nothing for me.

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:24.340
 My hair looks amazing.

00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:26.700
 I'm being accused of poaching.

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:30.300
 What's going on, mate?

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:34.640
 The only thing, other thing could be possibly like other large whales that have got teeth,

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.840
 but I reckon that would be the biggest.

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.080
 Yeah, it's gotta be up there, yeah.

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:44.220
 Just on the subject of fish teeth, I came across, actually a while ago, and I've been

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:48.920
 looking for a chance to mention it, an old Russian folktale of a beautiful young woman

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:52.920
 who's married to a really disgusting man that she hates.

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:56.760
 Sounds like my marriage.

00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:01.940
 Tell me how long that continues to be true in this story.

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:08.340
 To put him off having sex with her, she puts a fish head into her vagina so that every

00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:11.780
 time he's up for it, he's like, "Oh, what are all these teeth?"

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:13.940
 I guess it's one of these goldfish with the teeth heads.

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:14.940
 That's the paku.

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:21.140
 It's a paku head, it's specifies, and then she says, "What, you idiot, all women have

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:22.140
 this.

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:23.140
 You don't want to do it.

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:24.140
 You don't want to do it."

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:27.420
 That's what she's doing, and so he never gets to have sex with her.

00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:28.420
 Oh, wow.

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:29.420
 That's a shame.

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:30.580
 It's a really sad story for him.

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:31.580
 It is, really.

00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:32.580
 And for her, he's got a fish.

00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:33.580
 Yeah.

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:35.080
 In places where you shouldn't have fish.

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:37.100
 She's kind of a bit worse off, yeah.

00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:42.380
 If she'd have put a soccer mouth catfish up her belly, it might have been better, because

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:43.700
 they have bendy teeth.

00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:44.700
 Oh, okay.

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:49.180
 The first fish that we found that have got bendy teeth, because they scrape stuff off

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:54.780
 rocks, and if they had hard, non-bendy teeth, then they might fall off, or they might break

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:55.780
 or whatever.

00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:56.780
 That's cool.

00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:59.580
 And they reckon that probably more fish have them as well, but we've never found them before.

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:02.500
 So that might be quite nice, some bendy teeth.

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:03.500
 Yeah.

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:05.840
 Oh, she'd be so annoyed if she got that one fish.

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:07.660
 She's like, "Oh, I'm into this."

00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:10.740
 That's, vagina dentata is common in folklore, isn't it?

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:15.620
 And is it, who's the god in Moana?

00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:16.620
 It's Maui.

00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:17.620
 Maui.

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:18.620
 Yeah.

00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:20.500
 Is it written by some vagina or something?

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:25.540
 Yeah, I think that's not featuring the live-action Moana remake of Disney I'm currently working

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:26.540
 on.

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:35.540
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:40.700
 My fact this week is that a book club in America has finally finished reading Finnegan's Wake

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:43.620
 after 28 years of monthly meet-ups.

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:45.180
 28 years.

00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:46.180
 28 years.

00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:47.180
 Impressive.

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:48.180
 It's incredible.

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:54.460
 In 1995, there was between 10 and 30 people who would show up to these monthly book clubs,

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:58.900
 and Finnegan's Wake is a very complicated, unreadable book.

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:02.700
 They decided, rather than getting through the whole thing and doing it in one book club,

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:04.920
 they would take it two pages at a time.

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:09.620
 That proved to be, I think, a bit too much, so they then brought it down to one page per

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:11.540
 book club, and they've been doing this.

00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:14.660
 They did it, you know, through the pandemic, they've been doing it over Zoom, they keep

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:20.580
 meeting up, and yeah, they finally just got to the end, but it's being reported as the

00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:26.060
 end, but as the man who runs the book club, a guy called Jerry, pointed out, it ends on

00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:30.540
 a sentence that is a continuous loop sentence, which means you come right back to the beginning

00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:31.540
 of the book.

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:32.540
 No.

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:34.100
 So they're just starting from page one again now.

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:35.100
 What a horrible realisation.

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:36.540
 That must have been in the last session.

00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:37.540
 The last day.

00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:38.540
 Punch and pain.

00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:39.540
 Thank God.

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:42.540
 I never have to see these awful people again.

00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:43.540
 That's amazing.

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:44.540
 But it's amazing.

00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:47.580
 Like, the people who've been in and out of this group, one guy dropped out of the group

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:50.740
 for 20 years and came back, you know, they were still waiting.

00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:52.420
 They must have been quite lost, but then I suppose everyone is.

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:55.540
 I think they got through 15 chapters in that time, yeah.

00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:57.620
 Yeah, that's the whole point of it, isn't it?

00:31:57.620 --> 00:32:00.020
 It's a completely impenetrable book.

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:03.740
 Even people that you would consider to be those who love literature and would, like,

00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:09.380
 be snooty and say, "No, it's actually a masterpiece," all just say, "It's just lots of words."

00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:12.620
 No one can agree, like, who the main characters are, what the plot is.

00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:13.980
 Have you dipped into it?

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:14.980
 No.

00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:15.980
 Finnegan's way.

00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:16.980
 No of all-choice stuff.

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:17.980
 I don't know if Anna has.

00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:18.980
 No.

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:23.260
 Yeah, I think it's amazing that even after all this time, they've read it for 28 years,

00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:26.340
 they won't be able to say what happened, because no one knows what happened.

00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:27.340
 No one knows.

00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:28.740
 It's just, that's so amazing, isn't it?

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:29.740
 It's mad.

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:32.620
 It's almost like an endurance sport rather than a hobby now, isn't it?

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:33.620
 Like, 28 years.

00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:34.620
 But this is the thing.

00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:36.820
 They're not, like, alone in being a book club that has done this.

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:38.780
 They just happen to have possibly gone the longest.

00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:41.460
 There's a guy called Sam Slote, who's a historian.

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:44.700
 He's an expert at Trinity College Dublin on Joyce.

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:45.860
 That's what he looks into.

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:49.820
 And yeah, he was reading the book for 15 years.

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:53.300
 You know, there was other groups that, they all go into, like, just over 10 years.

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:55.260
 But this is the longest one so far.

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:58.300
 Think of all the books you've missed out on in that time that actually make sense.

00:32:58.300 --> 00:32:59.620
 Yeah, that's true.

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:01.740
 You can't read all the books in your lifetime.

00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:02.740
 Yeah.

00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:04.820
 You might as well stick with one's The Hungry Caterpillar.

00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:05.820
 Absolute banger.

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:06.820
 Yeah, absolutely.

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:08.820
 I just get through that many times in one meeting.

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:10.300
 I think this is what Joyce wanted.

00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:14.580
 I think he wanted people to dedicate their lives to reading just him, to analyzing him.

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:16.020
 That's quite a big move, isn't it?

00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:18.340
 Like, no, you'll be my book, not only my book.

00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:19.340
 Yeah.

00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:20.340
 Yeah, it is.

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:21.940
 It's a statement about what you think of yourself.

00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:23.940
 Well, he's kind of done it with certain people.

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:24.940
 Yeah.

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:25.940
 Yeah.

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:28.940
 You know, your fact, sorry, I meant to say, Dan, is wrong.

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:29.940
 Yeah, I know.

00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:30.940
 It's a spelling mistake.

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:32.940
 A spelling bit of a spelling mistake, yeah.

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:33.940
 Oh.

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:34.940
 Well, technically.

00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:35.940
 Oh, I see.

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:36.940
 Yeah, yeah.

00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:37.940
 There were punctuation errors, wasn't it?

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:38.940
 Yeah.

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:39.940
 Okay.

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:40.940
 It's an apostrophe, yes.

00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:41.940
 An apostrophe.

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:44.740
 I'd actually never noticed this until I went to the Wikipedia page.

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:46.660
 There's no apostrophe in it.

00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:49.500
 So it's not the wake of Finnegan.

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:52.380
 It's Finnegan's plural.

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:53.380
 Wake.

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:54.380
 It's like Finnegan's comma.

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:56.620
 Wake, exclamation mark.

00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:59.180
 And there's a character called Finnegan in it.

00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:01.580
 And I believe he's being resurrected.

00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:02.740
 So it's like he's waking up.

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:03.740
 So shouldn't he be the main character?

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:06.460
 I haven't read it either, but I would assume if it's called Finnegan's Wake and you've

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:07.460
 got a Finnegan.

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:10.380
 Well, there are quite a few Finnegan's as well.

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:11.380
 Oh, really?

00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:14.540
 I thought the Finnegan's was just referring to, was like pluralised to be confusing and

00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:17.260
 refer to like Irish people generally, but are there multiple Finnegan's in the book?

00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:18.500
 Well, there are multiple Finnegan's.

00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:24.820
 I think the collective Irish group being called Finnegan's is the most common explanation

00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:26.180
 for the lack of apostrophe.

00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:27.180
 Right.

00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:31.660
 Some people think it's so that the word wake can mean the awakening and also the wake has

00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:35.780
 enough to someone die, so it gives you a nice little bit of uncertainness there.

00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:39.180
 Some people think it was a fuck up by Samuel Beckett, who wrote...

00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:40.180
 Wait, sorry?

00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:41.180
 Samuel Beckett?

00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:42.180
 So...

00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:43.180
 Well, it's his proofreader.

00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:44.180
 No.

00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:45.180
 Well, Joyce kind of...

00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:47.300
 But what do you call it when someone speaks it to you?

00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:48.300
 Dictators.

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:49.300
 Yeah.

00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:50.300
 Beckett dictated it.

00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:51.300
 Really?

00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:52.300
 Yeah.

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:53.300
 Or certainly some of it.

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:54.300
 Are you mixing transcribing and dictating?

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:55.300
 Oh, perhaps.

00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:56.300
 What's the difference?

00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:57.300
 You would dictate...

00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:58.800
 Can you dictate to someone and then they transcribe what you're saying?

00:34:58.800 --> 00:34:59.800
 Oh, I see.

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:00.800
 Yes.

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:01.800
 I think Joyce is...

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:02.800
 Joyce was dictating.

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:03.800
 Beckett was transcribing.

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:04.800
 Excellent point.

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:05.800
 Maybe.

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:06.800
 Just maybe five minutes in the edit.

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:07.800
 Maybe they weren't there.

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:09.800
 Maybe it was always the other way around and Beckett wrote it.

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:11.280
 I was like, "Don't put my name on that.

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:13.040
 I don't want to be cursed."

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:17.540
 Famous story where Beckett is dictating and there's a knock on the door and James Joyce

00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:18.780
 says, "Come in."

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:21.620
 And Beckett just writes, "Come in in the middle of the story."

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:22.620
 Oh, really?

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:28.940
 So that was from a biography of Joyce, which where he interviewed Beckett and Beckett said

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:29.980
 this happened.

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:34.460
 But if you look in the text and just control F, you don't have to read the whole thing.

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:38.480
 But if you look in the text and look for the phrase, "Come in," there is no place where

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:41.160
 it's just like an interjection where it doesn't belong.

00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:46.600
 So either Beckett made it up or maybe it actually happened and then later on he thought, "You

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:47.600
 know what?

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:48.600
 That was stupid.

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:49.600
 I'm going to take that out."

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:50.600
 Right.

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:51.600
 I'm not sure what happened.

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:52.600
 Or an editor was like...

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:55.760
 I don't think there was much of an editor because there was loads of typos in all of Joyce's

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:56.760
 work, wasn't there?

00:35:56.760 --> 00:36:00.440
 That's something that's really interesting because I was reading an article where they're

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:05.740
 saying that basically the way you can read Joyce now, people have been trying to make

00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:09.300
 sense of this book so much that they've employed different ways of cleaning it up in order

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:10.300
 to make sense of it.

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:13.820
 So there's a version out there where people have taken all the typos out so it kind of

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:17.060
 reads a bit more smoother and you're not going, "What the hell is this word?"

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:21.340
 There's a digital version now where basically everything is hyperlinked.

00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:25.260
 Therefore you can get an understanding of everything and you find yourself using it

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:27.540
 as a repository of all knowledge.

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:31.160
 It's basically a weird encyclopedia where you just go, "Oh cool, I'm now learning about

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:33.160
 this random thing by clicking on it."

00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:35.400
 So they keep trying to turn it into something useful.

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:36.400
 But it's not.

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:37.400
 But it's not.

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:39.800
 Ultimately it's just not in its own thing.

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:44.360
 The words that he made up in it, there's a hundred letter long word on the first page

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:49.680
 which is the sound of a thunderclap that was heard at the fall of the Garden of Eden.

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:51.360
 Are you going to give us the words?

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:53.160
 Yeah, I want to hear the words.

00:36:53.160 --> 00:37:08.820
 [Singing]

00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:09.820
 That's close but not quite.

00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:10.820
 That was pretty good.

00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:11.820
 That's good.

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:12.820
 I felt like there was a storm outside.

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:15.980
 I would argue that Boom does the same job.

00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:19.020
 That would have been your first thing as an editor.

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:20.020
 Right.

00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:21.020
 Boom.

00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:22.020
 Opening words.

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:26.560
 Life would be more difficult for the Vengerbuys if no one had invented the word Boom and

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:28.560
 they had to do this four times.

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:30.280
 Much less catchy.

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:32.880
 It was reused by Sylvia Plath in the Belcha, that word.

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:33.880
 That word, right?

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:34.880
 Can I see it written down?

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:35.880
 Yeah, it's there.

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:37.880
 Are you thinking about using that in your next children's book account?

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:38.880
 It's in the title.

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:44.320
 It depends if you're on a word count for being paid a number of words or whether you're paid

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:46.680
 a number of letters.

00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:50.600
 Useful words as well that he made up, which we've already mentioned before, but quark.

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:52.600
 Quark is from Finnegan's Wake.

00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:53.600
 Yes.

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:54.600
 The scientific word it's from.

00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:59.260
 There's a line in it that goes three quarks for muster mark and then quarks can cluster

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:01.660
 together in threes to form other.

00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:03.020
 So that's where...

00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:08.320
 I think Murray Gellman wanted to call them quarks and he always had this idea of they're

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:15.260
 called quarks and then he saw the word quark in Finnegan's Wake where it clearly rhymes

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:19.700
 with mark, but even though he spelt it in the same way that Joyce did, he always pronounced

00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:20.700
 it quark.

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:23.680
 Do you think he really tediously corrected people whenever they refer to it?

00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:28.000
 It's really interesting because I always call them quarks having studied physics and I

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.620
 think 75% of physicists say quark rather than quark.

00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:35.480
 I can't believe as many as 25% are doing the pretentious.

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:36.480
 This is what he wanted.

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.480
 Quark pronunciation.

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:38.480
 Come on, physicists.

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:40.680
 This is very like the laser loser.

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:44.400
 So laser is an acronym, in fact, light, I forgot what it is.

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:45.400
 Light amplified.

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:46.400
 Yeah.

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:48.400
 And then someone's like actually the light's oscillating, so they should be called losers.

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:50.460
 I never heard that.

00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:53.860
 Oh, that's great.

00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:57.300
 Joyce was particularly upset about World War II, wasn't he?

00:38:57.300 --> 00:39:02.380
 I know none of us liked it, but it was a real bugbear for him because it interrupted the

00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:05.580
 publication of his book or he was worried it would get in the way.

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:10.860
 So as discussed, he spent 17 years writing it, which is not that long when you consider

00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:16.340
 how long it takes to read, but he was realizing he was sort of getting close to the end in

00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:20.960
 about 1936 and he was getting really stressed out about global conditions.

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:24.660
 At one point he complained to a friend, "Look, the fact that the world is in such a bad state

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:28.440
 at the moment is really stressful for me because I find it so hard to write being so anxious

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:29.940
 about it."

00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:34.280
 And then when he handed in the manuscript in 1939, he said, "Please hurry publishing

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:36.880
 it because war's going to break out and then no one will read my book anymore."

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:37.880
 That is amazing.

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:38.880
 That's not why.

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:45.740
 The thing is, if you're going to spend how long, 17, 18 years writing it, the chance

00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:49.160
 of you, it would have to be in the high end period of peace, wouldn't it?

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:53.560
 There's no other time when you're not going to run into some war or other.

00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:54.560
 You're right.

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:59.520
 So I was looking at what the longest book to read by pages rather than complexity.

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:00.520
 Oh yeah.

00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:04.960
 So the longest novel in the Penguin classics and modern classics is In Search of Lost Time

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:05.960
 by Marcel Proust.

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:06.960
 Yeah.

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:10.040
 It is six volumes, 3,616 pages.

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:13.280
 So in the time it would take you to read it, you could fly from London to Auckland and

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:15.280
 back again and then to Barbados.

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:20.140
 But only if you have to not take any breaks and to read one page a minute for that entire

00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:21.140
 time.

00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:22.140
 One page a minute.

00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:23.140
 Yeah.

00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:25.420
 I bought a copy of that thinking I would read it and it was absolutely massive.

00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:28.740
 And I started and then I realized that I only had the first volume.

00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:33.740
 If this is the first volume, there is no way in the world I'm going to read this.

00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:36.620
 Years ago I thought I'd read Oliver Twist and I said to someone, "Oh, I've just finished

00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:37.620
 Oliver Twist."

00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:39.780
 And they said, "Oh, did you like the bit about Dodger's Trial?"

00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:40.780
 And I said, "What trial?"

00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:45.300
 And I'd had the bridge version and I didn't realize I really missed out on it.

00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:50.440
 You read the transcript of the musical theatre version, Oliver exclamation mark.

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:52.820
 I love the songs, yeah.

00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:57.440
 You read as part of fish research or you started reading Curious If You Finish, Les Mis.

00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:00.580
 God, I started reading so many things as part of this research.

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:03.940
 In fact, I started reading The Woman in White a few weeks ago and still haven't got to the

00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:04.940
 end of that.

00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:07.640
 But yeah, Les Mis, I got most of the way through it but I didn't finish it.

00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:12.100
 Well, I read Les Mis's 365 chapters, so you can read one a day, which is quite neat.

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:15.300
 But not at a leap year or you can have a day off.

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:16.300
 Interesting.

00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:20.460
 James, have you ever thought about reading fiction for pleasure rather than for the podcast?

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:22.100
 I think you might get to the end of more books.

00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:23.100
 I really struggle.

00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:26.860
 I've got to say, I really struggle to read fiction for pleasure these days.

00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:27.860
 Really?

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:28.860
 Yeah.

00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:32.360
 Because I read so much non-fiction for my job, I need like a year off.

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:36.540
 What you need is a book club because I started doing a book club and it does force you to

00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:37.540
 read.

00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:41.180
 Yeah, and it forces you to read things that you might not have new books that have come

00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:42.180
 out that people have been interested in.

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:46.100
 Is that the idea of fiction that you're forced to read stuff and that's why you do it?

00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:48.760
 Just it carves out the time for you to do it, which is interesting.

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:49.760
 Accountability.

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:50.760
 Yeah.

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:51.760
 Aren't you in the same book club as Andy though?

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:52.760
 I think I've heard about someone from the book.

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:53.760
 Yeah.

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:54.760
 Is it just Andy's book every week?

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:55.760
 It is.

00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:56.760
 Yeah.

00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:57.760
 It does feel like a post-apocalyptic world.

00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.760
 I'm living it every time we chat about it.

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:01.720
 What was your best book you discovered through book club?

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:05.600
 Silly Plants of the Bell Jar, which I love her poetry and I've never read the book itself.

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:06.600
 I've never read the book.

00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:07.600
 Did you remember this?

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:08.600
 Yeah.

00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:10.740
 Because I haven't read that book and so I was going off Wikipedia that this word was

00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:11.740
 in it.

00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:12.740
 I think it is true, right?

00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:16.300
 Weirdly, I don't remember the word, but you know, you don't remember every detail, right?

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:18.260
 Well, you might remember a hundred-letter word.

00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:19.900
 I assumed it was a typo.

00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:22.900
 Well, no, but you know, also when you're on a deadline for book club, it's like, "Fantastic.

00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:26.180
 What a great word to zoom in on.

00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:27.180
 It's like the fast lane.

00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:28.180
 It's like a travelator."

00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:29.180
 They are good.

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:31.940
 Aren't you in a book club?

00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:37.160
 No, I'm not, but I think what I would like to be in one for is that discovering books

00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:38.160
 that you might not know about.

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:41.960
 So I've got some friends who are just so, so good at book recommendations and really

00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:44.280
 good at personalizing it to what you like to read.

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:48.320
 So I read an article years ago saying that actually there's an argument that you shouldn't

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:52.880
 read books that win prizes and the argument being that if you say you're not into Russian

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:56.440
 high society and agriculture, why would you suddenly be so just because it won a prize?

00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:58.920
 So actually, it can put you off books, which actually if you go in and say-

00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:01.920
 You're driving war on peace there.

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:02.920
 Sorry.

00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:07.500
 But what if you aren't into agriculture, aren't into Russian high society but are into people

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:08.500
 being hit by trains?

00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:09.500
 What do you-

00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:13.140
 Well, then I reckon there's somewhere a book shop with that's the category.

00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:16.700
 I hear Andy's podcast at qi.com/emailpinging.

00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:21.420
 How dare you spoil it, Andy?

00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:25.420
 Well, that's good that we're bucking and trying to bit you being in a book club, Dan.

00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:26.860
 And I, in fact, am in a book club.

00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:27.860
 And I'm not.

00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:28.860
 It's extraordinary.

00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:33.320
 I know we know that it's mostly women, but it's 88% of book clubs in America at least

00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:35.120
 are all women.

00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:40.520
 And women generally read quite a lot more fiction than men.

00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:42.720
 And book clubs are so popular these days as well.

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:46.360
 I think since Oprah Winfrey's book club, they've shot up.

00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:50.000
 I think there was a survey of women who read at least one book a month that found over half

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.240
 of them were in book clubs, which makes sense because when you're reading that often, that's

00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:54.240
 why.

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:55.240
 Well, here's a really interesting thing.

00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:59.980
 I went to a publishing party not too long ago, and there was an author there who I'd

00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:02.100
 met whose book came out at the same time as mine.

00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:03.100
 She had an American release.

00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:06.860
 It was a fiction novel called Wayward's Brilliant.

00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:09.740
 And she was the New York Times bestseller.

00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:12.620
 And she's an Australian who moved over here.

00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:13.820
 It's her first debut book.

00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:14.820
 I said, "How?

00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:15.820
 How?

00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:16.820
 You weren't even in America.

00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:17.820
 How did that happen?"

00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:18.820
 Book clubs.

00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:22.460
 She said, "Publishers desperately try and put their books in positions to get them into

00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:23.460
 book clubs."

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:26.880
 And she said, "You sell like 30 a time."

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:27.880
 They're just massive.

00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:28.880
 How do you...

00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:30.920
 What you go around like asking people, "Are you in a book club?"

00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:35.320
 So you give away a lot of free books and stuff online as e-books, and then it gets a reputation

00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:39.320
 and then book clubs pick it up and Reese Witherspoon is the other massive book club in America.

00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:40.320
 They're also...

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:41.320
 Do you mean big famous book clubs?

00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:42.320
 Yeah, yeah.

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:43.320
 Sorry, you don't mean just like my book club.

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:44.320
 No, no.

00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:45.320
 People will not buy my books.

00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:46.320
 But probably them as well.

00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:47.320
 Yeah.

00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:48.320
 Probably them as well, yeah.

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:49.320
 Just books that are heavily marketed or promoted.

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:50.960
 Do you know where the biggest book club in the world is?

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:51.960
 The biggest in the world.

00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:52.960
 Okay.

00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:53.960
 Yeah, right.

00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:54.960
 Contender.

00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:58.120
 I'm going to say Iceland, because they're famously, they all write books and read novels.

00:44:58.120 --> 00:44:59.120
 Oh, yes.

00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:01.600
 I feel like you've checked all the book club accounts, but I'm going with volume.

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:03.120
 I'm going with the digital world.

00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:04.120
 Booktalk.

00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:06.240
 So this is the book club version of TikTok.

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:07.240
 Oh, okay.

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:10.720
 So they believe that Booktalk has sold 20 million books in 2021.

00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:11.720
 Wow.

00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:12.720
 It's huge.

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:13.720
 There's this huge number of books now.

00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:14.720
 Colin Hooper, right?

00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:16.040
 Yeah, and they'll say like, "TikTok made me buy it."

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:18.560
 And it's like these books that just really drive through TikTok.

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:21.920
 So much so that they've launched the TikTok Book Awards this year.

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:26.000
 And what I love about this is because TikTok, I guess, is so many people, they're not just

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.880
 books that came out this year that were popular in one shop or by one sort of person.

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:30.880
 So they gave them a word to Jane Austen.

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:31.880
 She got revival.

00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:32.880
 Yeah.

00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:34.440
 So it's like really new stuff, really old stuff.

00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:39.280
 Can I ask, yeah, sorry, for like older listeners, not myself, obviously, but for other people

00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:43.640
 who might not really know what TikTok is, can you explain how that works?

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:45.880
 It's not just one book club where everyone reads the same thing.

00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:46.880
 No.

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:50.240
 So TikTok is video sharing and I'm guessing everybody who uses the hashtag Booktalk and

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:51.400
 can see what they're talking about.

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:55.120
 So things sort of trend and build and you sort of find, and I guess what's nice about

00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:57.920
 it is if you read a book that you love it and no one else has, you can find someone

00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:59.920
 who's made a video and see what they say about it.

00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:02.880
 Whereas if I've read one book and no one else I know has read it.

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:05.640
 And to be fair, sometimes I finish a book and I'll go onto Goodreads just to see what

00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:07.360
 people have said and see if I agree with them.

00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:08.360
 Oh yeah, have you seen it?

00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:09.360
 Yeah.

00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:10.360
 Definitely.

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:12.000
 But she has a good like twisty end and I'm like, did I understand that?

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.000
 Definitely.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:14.000
 What actually happened?

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.000
 I'll go and check.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.320
 I have a mental reasoning question for you.

00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:18.320
 Really?

00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:19.320
 Love these.

00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:20.320
 Love this book club.

00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:21.320
 Yeah.

00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:27.480
 So it was founded in 1996 and the idea was that it would be quite highbrow literary options

00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:28.480
 that she chose.

00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:33.760
 So she had great books in there like William Faulkner, Toni Morrison, Kulman McCarthy.

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:39.280
 So really good books over the years and every time she makes a choice it pretty much becomes

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:40.280
 a bestseller.

00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:41.280
 Yeah.

00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:42.360
 It's like rockets to the top of the charts.

00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:43.360
 Yeah.

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:44.360
 It doesn't exist anymore.

00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:47.000
 I think it stopped in about 2010 or something.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.000
 Okay.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.880
 So whenever she chose a book, book sales actually after that decreased.

00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:53.880
 Why?

00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:56.800
 Do you mean book sales more generally?

00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:58.080
 General book sales decreased.

00:46:58.080 --> 00:46:59.080
 Okay.

00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:00.080
 This is why.

00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:02.080
 Everyone wants you to buy this one particular book.

00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:05.480
 It went out of print really quickly and no one bought anything else because they were

00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:07.400
 waiting for that one to come back into print.

00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:08.400
 Interesting.

00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:09.400
 Interesting.

00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:10.400
 Not correct.

00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:11.400
 Good guess though.

00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:12.400
 Paper shortage.

00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:15.000
 It used up so many trees that.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.800
 Half of the Amazon Oprah is responsible for destroying actually.

00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:18.800
 Yeah.

00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:23.840
 No, it's specifically about the fact that she chose quite highbrow options but appealed

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:28.200
 to an audience that wouldn't necessarily be reading things like that all the time.

00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:29.200
 Okay.

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:30.200
 So you're.

00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:31.200
 They spent more time reading.

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:32.200
 She got it.

00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:33.200
 Oh.

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:35.640
 So rather than buying two books you buy one and read it for two weeks.

00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:36.640
 Exactly.

00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:41.080
 These people who are buying three books a week and pacing through them, they're suddenly reading

00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:42.080
 the Sound and the Fury.

00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:43.080
 Oh, that's fine.

00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:44.080
 Spending a few weeks.

00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:48.520
 So really everyone should be buying much shorter books and getting through more of them.

00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:50.520
 How long's your book though?

00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:51.520
 345 pages.

00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:53.040
 That's a very big font.

00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:59.400
 My mind's a children's book so it's a bit short.

00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:06.760
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is James.

00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:11.520
 Okay, my fact this week is that the liquid in a can of beans is more likely to make you

00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:13.640
 farter than the beans themselves.

00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:14.640
 Okay.

00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:16.040
 Good to know.

00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:17.040
 Incredible.

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:18.040
 Useful.

00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:19.040
 Useful knowledge.

00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:20.040
 Yeah.

00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:21.040
 Is it?

00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:23.040
 Are you going to start rinsing all over your mouth?

00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:28.560
 No, I'm going to start chugging bean juice because I just want to be more farty.

00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:32.840
 So this comes from an article on the website Serious Eats and they partnered with Harvard

00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:37.920
 Science of Cucking Program and looked at the fartiness of various beans and stuff like

00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:43.840
 that and to see if there were any ways to decrease the effect and they looked at various

00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:48.120
 old wives tales of how you do this like you soak your beans for ages.

00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:49.720
 This would not be a can of beans for instance.

00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:53.600
 You might soak your beans for ages and then cook them in a certain way and see if that

00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:54.600
 makes sense.

00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:55.600
 I like that there was someone soaking their Heinsbake beans.

00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:59.480
 Everyone always soaks beans so yeah, they're not left them overnight.

00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:03.400
 They might be cooking them with bay leaves or something like this and nothing really made

00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:09.840
 any difference but they looked at tinned beans and they did find actually that rinsed beans

00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:15.240
 from a tin are 20% less farty than unrinsed and that the liquid you throw away is 30%

00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:17.440
 fartier than the beans are themselves.

00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:18.440
 Wow.

00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:19.440
 And why?

00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:26.480
 So it seems like it kind of seeps into the juice and also the beans they kind of disintegrate

00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:30.080
 the longer they're in there and the more farty ones are the ones that disintegrate.

00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:33.920
 The hard ones that you just kind of go straight through you, they don't disintegrate.

00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:34.920
 Right.

00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:38.760
 So yeah, the fartiness seems to just get into the juice somehow.

00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:39.760
 That's so interesting.

00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:42.960
 I think some things probably work, right?

00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:48.440
 Like there are some things that could counteract the fartiness, there's kombu, the Japanese

00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:55.840
 seaweed that you get in, like kombu dashi, it's an ingredient of that and that has these

00:49:55.840 --> 00:50:01.000
 enzymes that break down the sugars in beans when you eat them.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:04.480
 So the reason that beans make you fart is because you can't digest the stuff in them

00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:07.040
 but the bacteria in your stomach can, right?

00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:14.080
 And then the bacteria as it digests it releases these gases and I believe that kombu manages

00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:17.640
 to break down those sugars so the bacteria doesn't have as much to eat and fart out.

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:18.640
 Correct.

00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:21.240
 And so if you add this seaweed to everything, that might work.

00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:22.240
 Might do.

00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:23.240
 You better go.

00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:27.720
 So actually, you mentioned my book before, I wrote about a guy who tried to stop farts

00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:30.120
 from being produced off the back of beans.

00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:31.120
 Yeah, he did.

00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:36.840
 Yeah, wonderfully, a man called Colin Leakey and Colin Leakey is the son of Mary and Louis

00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:41.040
 Leakey who were the great anthropologists who discovered all these hominid skeletons

00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:42.040
 throughout history.

00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:46.680
 So he had seen a report of NASA trying to make beans that could be sent into space and

00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:50.640
 not produce flatulence, so lose the fart stuff from beans and he thought, yes, that would

00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:56.080
 be amazing to do because if you could invent a bean that gave you less farts, you could

00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:59.920
 have that in developing countries where they sometimes, you know, Crohn's disease, for

00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:01.760
 example, beans are meant to be avoided.

00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:05.280
 So there's a lot of health implications if you have a lot of wind in you.

00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:08.720
 So he thought if I could invent a bean, that could be like a meat replacement and then

00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:11.880
 we could have safe eating that's going on for all these poorer countries.

00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:12.880
 Okay.

00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:16.280
 So he spent a lifetime doing that and he did invent two beans which are on sale and

00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:20.000
 have been sent over which are meat replacements and less flatulence.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:24.380
 So he was a scientist who did great things, but my favorite thing is he patented an invention

00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:29.280
 called the flatometer, which was a device that slots into your rectum and there's a tube

00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:33.520
 coming out that connects to a balloon on the other end and you tuck the balloon in your

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:37.760
 shirt pocket and you just collect these, these are his real invention.

00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:39.760
 It's bigger, bigger, bigger.

00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:40.760
 Kind of like the Viperfish.

00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:45.680
 At the end of the day you're like, oh, it's children's party ever.

00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:47.960
 Yeah, the balloon dog you get given.

00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:53.320
 So I was reading that they have measured how much volume a fart has and they did it by

00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:56.640
 feeding everyone beans and using a rectal catheter to catch the fart.

00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:58.240
 Would you like to guess the mills?

00:51:58.240 --> 00:51:59.840
 How many mills are average fart?

00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:01.200
 It's hard, isn't it?

00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:04.440
 Because it's a gas so it spreads out quite a lot so you would think it would be quite

00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:05.440
 a high mills.

00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:06.440
 Yeah, interesting.

00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:07.440
 572.

00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:08.440
 What?

00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:13.480
 I was going to say more like 20, you're kind of in the middle, 90, so we could fit in your

00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:14.480
 airport hand luggage.

00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:15.480
 Not really.

00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:17.520
 I suppose it doesn't count as a liquid, does it, unless you've done a little bit of follow

00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:19.520
 through.

00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:26.240
 Well, another useful thing scientists have invented, speaking of following through, a useful thing

00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:30.480
 scientists have invented is a machine that listens to your bottom and distinguishes a

00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:32.040
 fart from a shirt.

00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:33.040
 Ah.

00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:36.840
 And I would argue you would know without a machine whether that's happened.

00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:42.240
 You do usually know, don't you, but often, but do they tell you before or after?

00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:46.280
 It actually tells you when it's happened.

00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:49.760
 Is it more for when someone's done it, but you're with them and you say, was that a fart

00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:50.760
 or a shirt?

00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:51.760
 And they say, no, it's just a fart.

00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:56.520
 And then you go, let me get my machine out.

00:52:56.520 --> 00:53:00.040
 Get to the bathroom, you filthy pig.

00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:02.840
 It's meant to also detect more than that as well.

00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:05.400
 So the idea is that you have this device.

00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:12.040
 It's called the, and listen carefully, the Synthetic Human Acoustic Reproduction Testing,

00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:13.040
 another shot.

00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:14.040
 Oh.

00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:15.040
 Yeah.

00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:21.760
 And basically it's to give early warning of like colorectal cancers, things like that,

00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:25.760
 bowel cancers, because it's thought that you might have changes in your flatulence sounds

00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:27.160
 or in your poo sounds.

00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:30.760
 And if it listens, it might then say, oh, your poo sound a bit different these days or

00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:31.880
 your fart sound a bit weird.

00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:34.600
 Have you thought about getting checked out?

00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:39.560
 And so researchers listen to many hundreds of hours of audio of various pooing and farting

00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:43.160
 noises, and then tagged them correctly to train the machine.

00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:44.160
 Wow.

00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:49.640
 And it can now identify whether something's urination, flatulence, solid defecation or

00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:52.800
 diarrhea 98% of the time.

00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:56.920
 So it's not at the super advanced level yet, I suppose it's still at the stage of distinguishing

00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:57.920
 a wee from a poo.

00:53:57.920 --> 00:53:58.920
 Yeah.

00:53:58.920 --> 00:53:59.920
 It's not that advanced.

00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:04.640
 If you play them, George Osborne's new podcast, it does say it's diarrhea.

00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:11.080
 I was just thinking who I could slam if the podcast community wouldn't, wouldn't attack

00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:12.080
 us all.

00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:13.080
 Yeah.

00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:16.920
 Good luck when he's on next week.

00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:22.520
 How much do you think the cheapest can of beans you could buy in the UK was in 1996?

00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:23.520
 Oh, 1996.

00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:24.520
 Yeah.

00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:25.520
 Like 4p?

00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:26.520
 19?

00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:27.520
 Yeah, a couple of p.

00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:28.520
 A couple of p?

00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:29.520
 Yeah.

00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:30.520
 The answer is negative 2p.

00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:31.520
 Okay, you take them.

00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:32.520
 Why?

00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:33.520
 I'll have 2m.

00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:37.960
 Did you get like money back for returning the 10 or something?

00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:38.960
 No.

00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:44.480
 This was just a crazy moment in retail where it was called the bean wars.

00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:48.440
 And basically they were just competing and competing to make the price lower, to win

00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:49.440
 the competition.

00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:53.400
 Then it got to a point where this one place, which is called Supermarkets, and this place

00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:56.640
 called Sanders Supermarket basically had a deal whereby...

00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:58.760
 It surprised me enough it doesn't exist anymore.

00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:01.600
 I was like, oh, I sold too many beans on that bus.

00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:04.320
 But it went so low that they went into the negatives.

00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:09.560
 So if the beans were part of a shopping pile that you had, they took the 2p off of your

00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:10.560
 final bill.

00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:13.520
 If you were just buying the can of beans, they gave you 2p, but you could only do it

00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:15.020
 for one tin.

00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:16.020
 That was their thing.

00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:20.360
 But there was a point where you were paid to leave a supermarket with the can of beans.

00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:24.360
 This is like when you want a sandwich and it's better to get the meal deal than having

00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:27.160
 to buy a drink as well and then your sandwich is cheaper.

00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:30.400
 It is, but it's very rare that you can just take the drink from the meal deal and they'll

00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:31.520
 pay you for it.

00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:34.600
 The difference that you would have saved, that is unbelievable.

00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:36.720
 Tesco was selling them at 7p.

00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:40.920
 Do you think people went around lots of different supermarkets collecting as many 2p's as they

00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:41.920
 could?

00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:43.280
 But if it's 2p and 1 tin, it's quite limited.

00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:46.760
 So they'd probably lose less money than they would from like huffing the price of like

00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:47.760
 ketchup or toilet roll.

00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:48.760
 Totally.

00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:52.520
 The price of petrol or bus fare to get to the shop is going to be more than 2p.

00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:56.160
 So it's false economy to go around the country to all of these shops.

00:55:56.160 --> 00:56:01.320
 But it would feel nice to get your 2p off and get your free beans.

00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:05.440
 I'm the kind of person who would just always do that for no particular reason.

00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:06.440
 Don't you need that many beans?

00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:09.480
 Just going in with different hats on to get more beans.

00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:12.480
 I'm back again.

00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:15.760
 I was on the Heinz Factory website because they made beans.

00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:18.600
 And do you know the average number of beans in a Heinz tin?

00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:19.600
 Oh, well what size?

00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:20.600
 The normal size.

00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:21.600
 There are three sizes.

00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:22.600
 Wow, three.

00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:24.200
 Oh yeah, you've got those mini ones.

00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:27.640
 You've got the mini one, the full one, just like 200, 400, and then you've got the snack

00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:28.640
 pot.

00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:29.640
 Oh, you're so right.

00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:30.640
 Yeah, sorry.

00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:31.640
 I mean, the normal one.

00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:34.640
 Showing you too much why I eat for lunch.

00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:39.160
 And Ann mixes it up every day with a different one.

00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:45.600
 Yeah, I'm going to mix it up and have two small pots instead of one big pot.

00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:46.600
 Five hundred and seventy-two.

00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:47.600
 That's a good guess.

00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:50.360
 We switch sides in the reals, Alice.

00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:51.360
 The 400s.

00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:52.360
 The one everyone knows.

00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:59.760
 The mainstream one, not your edgy left field, trendy one.

00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:01.600
 He's so hipster these days, Ann.

00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:03.720
 Okay, standard size of beans.

00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:08.160
 I can't believe you now don't know the answer, given your knowledge.

00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:10.280
 You've bought so much time.

00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:12.480
 James, how many did you say?

00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:14.080
 Five hundred and seventy-two.

00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:18.760
 Okay, I'm going to go, I feel so invested in this now, I'm going to go four hundred and

00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:19.760
 twenty-four.

00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:20.760
 Nice.

00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:21.760
 Okay, then, three hundred and sixty-five.

00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:25.920
 And you have one, so it's worth something such as what?

00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:28.880
 I like Dan's idea of three hundred and sixty-five.

00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:35.720
 It's like every day I'll have one read and read one chapter of Les Miserables.

00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:37.880
 It's four hundred and sixty-five on average.

00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:43.560
 But the reason I say that is because in twenty-nineteen, a counsellor, Steve Smith, in a break

00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:49.560
 from cheating at Cricket, got back.

00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:54.600
 I do think it's a different guy, probably, he got back from a residence meeting late

00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:59.160
 at night, so I'll crack into a can of high-inspired beans and it was full of sauce and contained

00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:00.160
 one bean.

00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:02.920
 I don't remember that.

00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:03.920
 How crazy that I remember that.

00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:04.920
 Do you remember the story?

00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:06.920
 I don't remember that story coming up.

00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:09.360
 Imagine how farty he would have been the next day.

00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:10.360
 I know.

00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:13.640
 Hungry and farty, it's the worst combo.

00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:18.960
 Very randomly, I was in an office the other day, and in through the door came Greg Wallace,

00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:21.640
 who's in MasterChef, that guy.

00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:22.640
 That's weird.

00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:26.160
 Yeah, there was no connection between us two being there.

00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:29.840
 He came and just walked up to me and said, "Wanna hear a bean fact?"

00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:32.380
 And I was like, "Okay, yeah, sure."

00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:34.600
 I went, "Oh, I must listen to fish."

00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:39.680
 So at the bean factories, they have a laser which tests out good beans, and if they don't

00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:44.800
 like it, they flick the bean off, so they have a bean flicker at the thing, and I was

00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:46.840
 like, "Oh, great, that's so cool.

00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:51.400
 We could use that on fish or QI," and he went, "Are you connected to that?"

00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:56.080
 I would have assumed this guy's really into food facts, you know, and he just tells anyone.

00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:58.840
 He literally opened the door, looked me in the face, walked up to me and said, "Do you

00:58:58.840 --> 00:58:59.840
 want to hear a bean fact?"

00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:02.240
 Of course, I could have assumed he does.

00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:04.560
 Yeah, I genuinely would never have assumed that.

00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:06.120
 Did people just come up to you randomly?

00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:09.160
 If it's Greg Wallace, I would have thought, he knows he's famous, he's like, "I get a

00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:10.660
 way with doing this to a randomer."

00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:13.320
 I can't believe that I'm coming across as the weird one at this time.

00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:15.320
 You can't cause us very self-involved.

00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:20.040
 It's all about my podcast.

00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:22.040
 Greg Wallace is a bean guy.

00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:23.040
 That's so weird.

00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:24.240
 It does sound like a dream.

00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:25.240
 It does.

00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:26.240
 That is bizarre.

00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:27.240
 It does that, though.

00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:28.240
 It happened.

00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:30.240
 Would you like to hear a horrifying fart fact?

00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:33.360
 Now we're approaching the winter months, so you know on a cold day if you breathe out,

00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:34.360
 you can see your breath.

00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:35.360
 Yeah.

00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:39.600
 Well, if you fart loudly enough, you can see your fart on a cold day, but not if you're

00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:40.600
 wearing trousers.

00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:41.600
 Yes, okay.

00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:45.280
 But only a part of like, Winnie the Pooh that is like, "Winnie the Pooh."

00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:48.400
 And I think I've read that story.

00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:52.320
 Winnie the Pooh on a windy day, that's what that was about, isn't it?

00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:54.600
 Yes, another reason not to go out in public naked, eh?

00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:56.280
 I never realized that.

00:59:56.280 --> 00:59:59.320
 There must be footage on YouTube of people doing that, right?

00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:02.240
 I haven't searched it, but feel free to check it out.

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:05.400
 I rather think it might be on more specialist channels than YouTube.

01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:07.920
 Back to Dan's Only fans.

01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:10.480
 Yeah, that's a new whole threat for me.

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:13.280
 And wiki farts.

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:20.280
 Okay, that's it.

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:21.960
 That is all of our facts.

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:25.920
