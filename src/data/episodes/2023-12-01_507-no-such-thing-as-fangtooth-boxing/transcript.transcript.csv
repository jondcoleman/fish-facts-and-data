00:00:00,00:00:04,"Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish!"
00:00:04,00:00:13,"Andrew Hunter Murray is off on his hollybops, sailing the seven seas, looking for new unbeknownst"
00:00:13,00:00:18,"species of moss and while he is away, we have got a guest for you and that guest is none"
00:00:18,00:00:20,other than Anne Miller.
00:00:20,00:00:24,"Of course you know Anne, she's one of the QIL, she's a really good friend of ours and"
00:00:24,00:00:26,it's great to have her back.
00:00:26,00:00:30,One thing you really need to know about Anne especially in these weeks upcoming to Christmas
00:00:30,00:00:36,"is that she is also a published author, she has written a series of children's books,"
00:00:36,00:00:39,"they are known as Mickey and the Animal Spies, they're known as that because that is their"
00:00:39,00:00:44,"name and they're absolutely brilliant, my daughter absolutely loves looking at the pictures"
00:00:44,00:00:48,and I'm sure when she gets to the right age she will enjoy reading them as well.
00:00:48,00:00:52,"While we're on the subject of books, of course it would be remiss of me not to mention our"
00:00:52,00:00:57,"book, Mine and Anna's new book, Everything to Play for the QI Book of Sport, definitely"
00:00:57,00:01:01,"buy that for your loved ones for Christmas, anyone who likes sport, definitely buy it"
00:01:01,00:01:02,for them.
00:01:02,00:01:05,"If you don't like sport but you like what we do, I promise you'll love this book because"
00:01:05,00:01:11,"it's full of loads of interesting human stories, drama, it's the ultimate sports book for people"
00:01:11,00:01:15,who don't really like sports and also people who do like sports will like it as well.
00:01:15,00:01:19,"It's for everyone, that's the great thing about our book but then that also has to be"
00:01:19,00:01:23,"true of Andy and Dan's books, you definitely should go and get those as well."
00:01:23,00:01:28,"Dan's book is called The Theory of Everything Else, it's a brilliant look into his brain,"
00:01:28,00:01:34,his unique brain let's say but he's looked at the history of people who had done otherwise
00:01:34,00:01:41,great things but deep down they had a dark secret of believing some weird shit and speaking
00:01:41,00:01:45,"of weird shit you should also have a look at Andy's books, Andrew Hunter Murray he has"
00:01:45,00:01:50,"two books they're called The Sanctuary and The Last Day, they're both brilliant acerbic"
00:01:50,00:01:56,dystopian books that tell you something about the modern day while thrilling you with an
00:01:56,00:01:59,"incredible story about the future, they're absolutely amazing, you've got to get those"
00:01:59,00:02:00,as well.
00:02:00,00:02:03,Basically what I'm saying is who doesn't love a book for Christmas and there's a ton
00:02:03,00:02:09,of them made by your favourite QILs that are all available online and mine and as Dan's
00:02:09,00:02:13,and Andy's you can find at noteswiththingsafish.com/books.
00:02:13,00:02:18,One more very very important thing I need to say before I leave you in peace to listen
00:02:18,00:02:23,"to the podcast is that we do have a couple of live shows coming up just before Christmas,"
00:02:23,00:02:28,they will take place in London on Thursday the 7th of Friday the 8th of December at the
00:02:28,00:02:33,"Soho Theatre, now we've already mentioned this to the clubfish members and I think it's"
00:02:33,00:02:37,been on social media so the truth is there are not many tickets left.
00:02:37,00:02:45,"If you do want to come and see this show, literally pause now and go to noteswiththingsafish.com/live,"
00:02:45,00:02:48,"click on the link and check if there are any tickets left, you never know sometimes extra"
00:02:48,00:02:53,tickets do come up closer to the date so do go and check there anyway and hopefully see
00:02:53,00:02:56,some of you there for our Christmas shows.
00:02:56,00:02:59,"Anyway thank you so much for getting to the end of this without fast forwarding, if you"
00:02:59,00:03:04,"have fast forwarded and got to here without hearing the last bit, shame on you."
00:03:04,00:03:09,But anyway it's time for our podcast with Anmela so there is nothing more to say apart
00:03:09,00:03:16,from on with the podcast!
00:03:16,00:03:32,"Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:03:32,00:03:35,to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.
00:03:35,00:03:39,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, James Harkin and Ann"
00:03:39,00:03:43,Miller and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts
00:03:43,00:03:48,"from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go!"
00:03:48,00:03:51,Starting with fact number one and that is Anna.
00:03:51,00:03:58,My fact this week is that a list of adorable things written over a thousand years ago includes
00:03:58,00:04:04,chicks who look like their clothes are too big for them and faces drawn on melons.
00:04:04,00:04:13,Can I ask for definitions of chicks and melons because I live in the 1990s.
00:04:13,00:04:19,"Right, both chicks and melons mean what they've meant in every decade outside of the 1990s."
00:04:19,00:04:29,"I'm afraid, baby chickens and fruit."
00:04:29,00:04:33,"People are writing about adorable things a thousand years ago, that's weird."
00:04:33,00:04:37,I actually heard this reference on radio for this week so I'm sure there are people who
00:04:37,00:04:38,also heard it mentioned it.
00:04:38,00:04:44,It's the pillow book which is this extraordinary book written by a woman in Japan in the tenth
00:04:44,00:04:52,century and the Haiyan period and that's why we chose this.
00:04:52,00:05:00,"God, it took me a long time to find a Haiyan period."
00:05:00,00:05:07,"Anyway, this woman basically wrote a diary of just random stuff that popped into her"
00:05:07,00:05:12,head of lists and observations and things she thought should happen and shouldn't happen
00:05:12,00:05:16,and things people should wear and shouldn't wear and one of them was his list of really
00:05:16,00:05:21,"cute things and one of them was faces drawn on melons, one of them was chicks who look"
00:05:21,00:05:25,like their clothes are too big which I think is like if you see a chick but its feathers
00:05:25,00:05:29,"look like they're a bit swollen, you know they look like they look like you dress them"
00:05:29,00:05:30,up in human clothes.
00:05:30,00:05:31,That's what I thought.
00:05:31,00:05:32,That's cute.
00:05:32,00:05:33,That would be even cuter.
00:05:33,00:05:36,"From what I could tell from interpretations of it, I think they're just talking about"
00:05:36,00:05:39,chicks who look like they don't fit into their clothes yet.
00:05:39,00:05:40,Right.
00:05:40,00:05:41,They're too small.
00:05:41,00:05:44,That's slightly less cute than like a hat and dungarees.
00:05:44,00:05:48,"Well, take it up with, say, Shonagun, the author of this book, maybe she hadn't thought"
00:05:48,00:05:49,of that.
00:05:49,00:05:52,"The good thing about this book is, and I'm sure you all found this reading it, it's"
00:05:52,00:05:54,"just like someone is writing today, isn't it?"
00:05:54,00:05:55,Yeah.
00:05:55,00:05:56,It's just like this cute thing.
00:05:56,00:06:01,"So one is a young palace page, obviously that's not the thing anymore, but a young"
00:06:01,00:06:07,palace page who is still quite small and walks by in ceremonial costume and that's just
00:06:07,00:06:12,"like if you go to a wedding and you see a little toddler, a page boy in a suit."
00:06:12,00:06:13,Yeah.
00:06:13,00:06:14,It's true.
00:06:14,00:06:15,"But it's not all happy stuff, is it?"
00:06:15,00:06:20,"There's so many great pissed off lists, things like things that are unpleasant to hear, someone"
00:06:20,00:06:24,"who has an ugly voice yet speaks and laughs without restraint, so she has a list for that."
00:06:24,00:06:27,She has a list for things that give a pathetic impression.
00:06:27,00:06:33,"The voice of someone who blows his nose while he is speaking, the impression of a woman"
00:06:33,00:06:37,"plucking her eyebrows, it's all so odd."
00:06:37,00:06:41,"My favourite random one in there is the list of extremely frightening things, do you guys"
00:06:41,00:06:42,know?
00:06:42,00:06:43,"No, I didn't see that."
00:06:43,00:06:48,"It's thunder, yeah, fair enough, and I just enjoy this one, extremely frightening thing,"
00:06:48,00:06:53,"when a thief has entered the house next door, one is extremely frightened."
00:06:53,00:07:01,"If he breaks into the house where one is actually living, if he breaks into the house where one"
00:07:01,00:07:07,"is actually living, one loses consciousness and knows nothing more, which is true."
00:07:07,00:07:08,That's true.
00:07:08,00:07:10,"So I think some of these, they sound like stand up routines."
00:07:10,00:07:11,"Yeah, exactly."
00:07:11,00:07:15,"It's like, I've found one which is things that are infuriating, which sounds like it's"
00:07:15,00:07:19,"like a Josh Whittacum routine, it says, ""This is what's infuriating."
00:07:19,00:07:22,Someone suddenly falls ill and an exorcist is sent for.
00:07:22,00:07:27,They don't find him in the usual place and a tedious amount of time is spent waiting
00:07:27,00:07:29,while they go around in search of him.
00:07:29,00:07:33,"Finally, they manage to locate him and with great relief, you see him to performing the"
00:07:33,00:07:35,exorcism rites.
00:07:35,00:07:39,"However, the recent exertions of exercising some other possessive spirit seems to have"
00:07:39,00:07:40,worn him out.
00:07:40,00:07:45,For no sooner does he sit down and start in on the chanting than his spirit seems to
00:07:45,00:07:51,"have worn him out, his voice goes drowsy, and that is utterly infuriating."""
00:07:51,00:07:52,I think.
00:07:52,00:07:53,"It's so relatable, isn't it?"
00:07:53,00:07:54,Yeah.
00:07:54,00:07:56,"My note for Josh may be broad, isn't it?"
00:07:56,00:07:57,A tiny bit.
00:07:57,00:08:00,"I like the idea this is a, ""Hey, what about airplane food?"""
00:08:00,00:08:02,It clearly is.
00:08:02,00:08:03,There's a list.
00:08:03,00:08:04,Rare things.
00:08:04,00:08:06,A silver tweezer that is good at plucking out the hair.
00:08:06,00:08:07,This is today.
00:08:07,00:08:08,It is.
00:08:08,00:08:10,You can't get tweezers that pluck out hairs well.
00:08:10,00:08:13,How have they not designed this in the last thousand years?
00:08:13,00:08:15,"It's basically shots of miscellany, isn't it?"
00:08:15,00:08:21,"Because it is list, but it's also essays sometimes, or diaries, yeah, diary entries, observations."
00:08:21,00:08:25,"So this is, just to put it into the period, I know everyone probably knows the years of"
00:08:25,00:08:33,"the high Anne period, but we're talking the year 1000 is what's going on here."
00:08:33,00:08:37,"And at the time that she was writing this book, Beowulf was being written also, just"
00:08:37,00:08:40,to put in context the other great pieces of literature.
00:08:40,00:08:42,"Not nearly as relatable, Beowulf."
00:08:42,00:08:43,No.
00:08:43,00:08:44,"No, that's true."
00:08:44,00:08:45,"I haven't actually read it, so I..."
00:08:45,00:08:47,"Well, the first word in it, we still don't know what it means."
00:08:47,00:08:48,Really?
00:08:48,00:08:49,I think so.
00:08:49,00:08:50,Wow.
00:08:50,00:08:51,Really?
00:08:51,00:08:52,Yeah.
00:08:52,00:08:53,Do you say the word?
00:08:53,00:08:54,Do you know it?
00:08:54,00:08:55,"It's like, ""What?"""
00:08:55,00:08:56,Yeah.
00:08:56,00:09:00,"And she was, so she was working in the court of the empress at the time."
00:09:00,00:09:04,"She was like a lady-in-waiting who was always there, and she basically wrote this book because"
00:09:04,00:09:07,she just had a lot of spare time with nothing to do.
00:09:07,00:09:08,So she never intended it for publication.
00:09:08,00:09:11,It was just a personal book that she was writing.
00:09:11,00:09:14,We don't even properly know her name.
00:09:14,00:09:19,"So she's called, say, Seanagun, but that's, Seanagun is the title that you're given."
00:09:19,00:09:21,It's a minor counselor.
00:09:21,00:09:25,"And ""say"" is the name that was added later, which refers to her father's name, so you"
00:09:25,00:09:29,can distinguish her from the other Seanaguns who were in part of the court.
00:09:29,00:09:34,So do we think it could be Josh Whittacum gone back in time to the Haiyan period?
00:09:34,00:09:35,It's possible.
00:09:35,00:09:36,Say Seanagun.
00:09:36,00:09:39,Does that sound like a Japanese version of Josh Whittacum?
00:09:39,00:09:40,Yeah.
00:09:40,00:09:41,That's what I was thinking.
00:09:41,00:09:45,"The word ""haiyan"" means ""peace"" in Japanese, because it was particularly, it was quite"
00:09:45,00:09:48,"long period, and it was a time where there wasn't much war going on, so people had time"
00:09:48,00:09:51,to write these stand-up routines.
00:09:51,00:09:53,That's why she was so bored.
00:09:53,00:09:54,I reckon she craved a war.
00:09:54,00:09:56,Do we think she was a bit of a bitch?
00:09:56,00:09:57,Was she?
00:09:57,00:09:58,What?
00:09:58,00:09:59,"Well, I mean, just from what she writes."
00:09:59,00:10:00,"I mean, like, adorable things."
00:10:00,00:10:01,Give us some examples.
00:10:01,00:10:02,"I mean, the..."
00:10:02,00:10:03,"Pretty much, list your reading."
00:10:03,00:10:04,"Yeah, you're right."
00:10:04,00:10:05,I think she had mean qualities.
00:10:05,00:10:10,"In fact, there was a story about her where one of her neighbor's houses burned down and"
00:10:10,00:10:12,they lost everything they owned.
00:10:12,00:10:15,The fire in the house next door is the most scary thing.
00:10:15,00:10:17,That guy wasn't in her house.
00:10:17,00:10:22,"Well, I don't know how scary she was finding it, because basically she wrote a kind of"
00:10:22,00:10:24,little note mocking this person.
00:10:24,00:10:25,Right.
00:10:25,00:10:26,He's lost everything.
00:10:26,00:10:28,"He's standing outside his house, you know, naked, and gives it to her mum and says, ""Hey,"
00:10:28,00:10:31,"go give this note, taking the piss out of this guy to him."""
00:10:31,00:10:32,Okay.
00:10:32,00:10:37,She had what was effectively a lot of people claim was a rival.
00:10:37,00:10:43,"I don't think we fully know that, but it is someone who is friend of the podcast, Murasaki"
00:10:43,00:10:49,"Chikibu, who wrote, and we mentioned in episode 63 of Fish, The Tale of Genji."
00:10:49,00:10:50,The Tale of Genji.
00:10:50,00:10:54,"Yeah, the first ever novel, which finished mid-sentence, right, like it just cuts off."
00:10:54,00:10:59,"What happened was is that Sei Shonagun was working for this empress, and at the time"
00:10:59,00:11:03,"it was one emperor, one empress, that's how it worked, but they bucked the trend with"
00:11:03,00:11:06,"this one, and suddenly she was no longer the exclusive empress."
00:11:06,00:11:11,"So he got married again, and the lady-in-waiting who became the lady-in-waiting for the next"
00:11:11,00:11:14,"lady was this person, The Tale of Genji."
00:11:14,00:11:15,No way.
00:11:15,00:11:16,Yeah.
00:11:16,00:11:20,"So that's why they were kind of like in rival land, according to certain historians."
00:11:20,00:11:27,"So that book, The Tale of Genji by Murasaki, has a word, kawayushi, which is the word which"
00:11:27,00:11:33,"turned into the modern-day word, kawaii, which means cute in Japanese."
00:11:33,00:11:39,"And this idea of, you know, lots of cute animals, and, you know, Hello Kitty and all that kind"
00:11:39,00:11:40,of stuff.
00:11:40,00:11:45,"This is kind of a 20th century thing that we're not sure exactly, there's lots of reasons"
00:11:45,00:11:49,"why it might have come about, but possibly a reaction to the war, to the bombs, stuff"
00:11:49,00:11:50,like that.
00:11:50,00:11:55,"People wanted to go from the horrors of war to cuteness, but definitely seems to have"
00:11:55,00:11:58,become popular when mechanical pencils came out.
00:11:58,00:12:03,"So you know those pencils that kind of, you know, you twist them and the blood comes out."
00:12:03,00:12:04,Twist them?
00:12:04,00:12:05,Do you not click them?
00:12:05,00:12:07,Or the one where you take the little one out and put it in the top?
00:12:07,00:12:09,Do you remember them from Proud Boys' Girl?
00:12:09,00:12:10,There's so many different ones.
00:12:10,00:12:13,"Hang on, you have to, there's a little pocket containing this."
00:12:13,00:12:17,"Inside the, where like the leg would go, there were like tiny little things and you pop one"
00:12:17,00:12:20,out of the bottom and pop it in the top to save you from opening your pencil.
00:12:20,00:12:23,"I hated them all because they write so horribly, so..."
00:12:23,00:12:29,"Well, they were very popular in 1970s Japan, where you would not have fit in."
00:12:29,00:12:34,"Because they could write very, very thin lines and it inspired a kind of writing among teenage"
00:12:34,00:12:39,"girls where they would put like lots of little hearts and little, you know, characters and"
00:12:39,00:12:46,stuff in their writing and it was so popular and it made the writing so difficult to read
00:12:46,00:12:48,that it was banned in loads of schools.
00:12:48,00:12:49,Right.
00:12:49,00:12:52,"Basically, you weren't allowed to write in this kawai style, but by then the trend had"
00:12:52,00:12:53,already taken off.
00:12:53,00:12:57,"I guess once you've started doing it, it sort of becomes your hand, like there were some"
00:12:57,00:13:00,people who would do like proper circles over their eye or like little hearts.
00:13:00,00:13:01,"And I was like, ""Why?"
00:13:01,00:13:02,"It takes a little bit longer!"""
00:13:02,00:13:07,"I was just going to ask, ""And were you a heart to blow the eye?"""
00:13:07,00:13:10,I barely dot my eyes!
00:13:10,00:13:11,Your eyes are just a line.
00:13:11,00:13:13,You don't have time for that dot.
00:13:13,00:13:14,And but it's not...
00:13:14,00:13:20,I was reading a sort of paper on it saying it's not as cutesy as maybe our version of
00:13:20,00:13:22,"cute, like it's got a bit of an edge, so..."
00:13:22,00:13:24,The kawaii cute.
00:13:24,00:13:25,"The kawaii cute, yeah."
00:13:25,00:13:29,"The Japanese cute, which you can kind of see, there's sometimes a bit of a dark edginess"
00:13:29,00:13:30,to it.
00:13:30,00:13:35,"There's a character called Gloomy the Naughty Grizzly, who I hadn't come across, but apparently"
00:13:35,00:13:37,that's a big cultural phenomenon.
00:13:37,00:13:42,"And he's a two meter tall, like cuddly bear, but he's very violent."
00:13:42,00:13:44,He's covered in blood quite a lot of the time.
00:13:44,00:13:47,He attacks his owner quite a lot.
00:13:47,00:13:51,"And that's kawaii in Japan, but not necessarily something we would say was cute."
00:13:51,00:13:55,"I think that's like Kimo kawaii, so it's like grotesque and cute at the same time."
00:13:55,00:13:57,I think that's what they call it.
00:13:57,00:14:02,"And yeah, obviously they have loads of mascots, don't they, in Japan."
00:14:02,00:14:08,"In 2015, the governor of Osaka complained that he couldn't recognise most of his prefectures"
00:14:08,00:14:09,mascots.
00:14:09,00:14:10,They had 92 of them.
00:14:10,00:14:11,Wow.
00:14:11,00:14:13,In Osaka alone.
00:14:13,00:14:15,And he ordered a cull.
00:14:15,00:14:20,"And 20 of his characters were - oh, wow."
00:14:20,00:14:22,Murdered by the grizzly bear.
00:14:22,00:14:23,"Public executions, I hope."
00:14:23,00:14:29,"He made a list, like, 20 mascots that really annoy me, and then I - yeah."
00:14:29,00:14:31,"It's amazing how successful it was, though."
00:14:31,00:14:35,"You know how, when governments try to be cool, you know, like David Cameron saying he sports"
00:14:35,00:14:38,"Aston Villa or whatever, and it's just massive cringe."
00:14:38,00:14:42,"But the Japanese government, basically in the '90s, did, like, cool Japan, which was"
00:14:42,00:14:48,"a bit like we had cool Britannia here, and cool Japan was the idea of exporting all this"
00:14:48,00:14:49,Japanese cultural stuff.
00:14:49,00:14:52,"And they don't know how they did it, but they nailed it, because it's so popular now, isn't"
00:14:52,00:14:53,it?
00:14:53,00:14:56,"You get people who are really into manga, really into those styles."
00:14:56,00:14:57,Hello Kitty is a global phenomenon.
00:14:57,00:14:58,Hello Kitty.
00:14:58,00:15:03,"Well, like in the cool Britannia was like Blair versus Oasis, and do you think in Japan"
00:15:03,00:15:06,now kids are listening to what's a starry morning glory?
00:15:06,00:15:07,Yeah.
00:15:07,00:15:08,"Oh, yeah."
00:15:08,00:15:09,It's still Blair and Oasis.
00:15:09,00:15:10,Is it?
00:15:10,00:15:11,"Yeah, yeah."
00:15:11,00:15:12,It's not resolved.
00:15:12,00:15:13,Yeah.
00:15:13,00:15:14,"Hang on, but are Blair and Oasis popular there?"
00:15:14,00:15:15,I think it's now.
00:15:15,00:15:16,It's not by saying that.
00:15:16,00:15:17,Not anymore.
00:15:17,00:15:20,"Damn, it'd be great if they were, because that would be my cultural homeland."
00:15:20,00:15:22,"That's when I stopped learning about pop music, was it about 1998?"
00:15:22,00:15:26,"Yeah, wouldn't it be great if there was, like, a little museum somewhere where you could"
00:15:26,00:15:31,"go, and they're still listening to all your kind of, it's called, smoother fans."
00:15:31,00:15:33,Blair Oasis.
00:15:33,00:15:35,"Oh, God."
00:15:35,00:15:38,"Cuteness is a funny thing, isn't it?"
00:15:38,00:15:40,And we are the cutest of the primates.
00:15:40,00:15:42,So that's nice for us.
00:15:42,00:15:43,Officials.
00:15:43,00:15:44,We're self-proclaimed.
00:15:44,00:15:45,Officials.
00:15:45,00:15:48,"I guess it is self-proclaimed, because we're the only ones who can write about it."
00:15:48,00:15:50,We're any of the bonobos allowed to vote in this?
00:15:50,00:15:51,"Screw you, gorillas."
00:15:51,00:15:52,You can't read.
00:15:52,00:15:54,You can't define what's cute.
00:15:54,00:15:59,"You know, what's kind of defined as cute is the traits that are common in infants."
00:15:59,00:16:03,"And that is, it was actually defined by this guy called Conrad Lorenz, who won a Nobel"
00:16:03,00:16:04,Prize.
00:16:04,00:16:09,"It's called the Kinder Schema, and it's a large brain capsule, as he puts it, big forehead,"
00:16:09,00:16:11,I think we'll call it.
00:16:11,00:16:17,"Large and low-lying eyes, bulging cheeks, short and thick extremities, a springy elastic"
00:16:17,00:16:21,"consistency and clumsy movements, which is, like, the ugliest way to describe what is"
00:16:21,00:16:22,actually a really cute image.
00:16:22,00:16:23,"Oh, yeah, image."
00:16:23,00:16:27,"Oh, wasn't there, there was a thing I read a while ago about, about animals who found"
00:16:27,00:16:30,"those cute, like an elephant, like caressing people, and they think, like, oh, you're just"
00:16:30,00:16:31,so cute and small.
00:16:31,00:16:32,It was really lovely.
00:16:32,00:16:36,"I don't know if I want to be caressed by an elephant, you know, of all the animals that"
00:16:36,00:16:37,could caress me.
00:16:37,00:16:38,It may not.
00:16:38,00:16:39,I think there's an elephant.
00:16:39,00:16:40,I feel like I have a trunk involved.
00:16:40,00:16:41,That sounds likely.
00:16:41,00:16:43,"They're quite empathetic elephants, aren't they?"
00:16:43,00:16:47,One of the scariest things is an elephant caressing next door's baby.
00:16:47,00:16:50,Absolutely terrifying.
00:16:50,00:16:57,"There was a study done in 2009, and this was, they gave people a load of cute images, and"
00:16:57,00:16:59,then they asked them to play the game Operation.
00:16:59,00:17:03,"So you know where you have, like, a plastic body, and you have to pull out the funny bone"
00:17:03,00:17:05,and stuff so that it doesn't buzz.
00:17:05,00:17:09,Well it turned out that anyone who'd been exposed to high cuteness stimuli was better
00:17:09,00:17:10,at Operation.
00:17:10,00:17:11,Ah.
00:17:11,00:17:15,"So first of all, a tip for Christmas, if you go home and someone's got Operation, have"
00:17:15,00:17:19,"a quick look at some kawaii stuff before you play, and it'll help."
00:17:19,00:17:23,"But secondly, it's due to extreme carefulness, and the idea is you've seen lots of cute things,"
00:17:23,00:17:27,"you want to look after them almost, and you want to be more careful."
00:17:27,00:17:28,Right.
00:17:28,00:17:32,"But don't look at the bloodied bear, because that might give you the impression that blood"
00:17:32,00:17:34,all over your Operation human is going to be...
00:17:34,00:17:35,Adorable.
00:17:35,00:17:36,Adorable.
00:17:36,00:17:39,"You heard, like, 4D operation as a kid, damn, that'd be all blood."
00:17:39,00:17:41,Are you guys in use of all blood?
00:17:41,00:17:42,Oh my God.
00:17:42,00:17:53,"Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anne."
00:17:53,00:17:58,My fact is that the Viperfish has teeth that are so long it can't close its mouth properly
00:17:58,00:18:00,or it would impale its own brain.
00:18:00,00:18:01,Hmm.
00:18:01,00:18:03,"I bet there are a few that have, though."
00:18:03,00:18:08,"Yeah, the idiot kids, the Darwin-award Viperfish."
00:18:08,00:18:09,Exactly.
00:18:09,00:18:12,"But so have they sort of evolved, like, the equivalent of a doorstopper?"
00:18:12,00:18:13,They have.
00:18:13,00:18:16,"So basically, they're very, like, very long and silver, and they've got these lighty-up"
00:18:16,00:18:20,"spots along the bottom of their stomach, and then they have these huge teeth that kind"
00:18:20,00:18:24,"of pierce upwards from their jaw, and luckily it doesn't impede their hunting, because to"
00:18:24,00:18:28,hunt it basically just swims around with its mouth open until it finds prey.
00:18:28,00:18:32,"It can unhinge its jaw and rotate its skull, so when it finds prey it just basically swims"
00:18:32,00:18:36,"straight at it, and then it clamps its teeth shut like a cage and holds them in its mouth"
00:18:36,00:18:37,and then eats them.
00:18:37,00:18:38,Hmm.
00:18:38,00:18:39,"It can close its mouth, so..."
00:18:39,00:18:43,"The teeth are coming out, so it's like making a seal, so they're kind of like having a very"
00:18:43,00:18:44,extreme overbite.
00:18:44,00:18:49,"Yeah, because I know there's another fish called the common fangtooth, which, as its"
00:18:49,00:18:54,"name might suggest, has fangy teeth, and what they have is they have special sockets on"
00:18:54,00:18:58,"either side of their brain so that when they close their mouth, their teeth go into those"
00:18:58,00:18:59,sockets.
00:18:59,00:19:00,"Well, that is nice."
00:19:00,00:19:01,Isn't that amazing?
00:19:01,00:19:02,Yeah.
00:19:02,00:19:03,It's so precise with the pockets.
00:19:03,00:19:05,"I think, like, if you got punched in the jaw and that was slightly dislocated, the first"
00:19:05,00:19:09,"time you tried to shut your mouth, it would then miss the holes and pierce you in the"
00:19:09,00:19:10,brain.
00:19:10,00:19:11,That would be...
00:19:11,00:19:12,That's why there's no boxing in the fangtooth community.
00:19:12,00:19:13,I think that's correct.
00:19:13,00:19:14,Yeah.
00:19:14,00:19:18,"But Biprofish is really cool, so as well as being able to get its prey in this cage, it"
00:19:18,00:19:22,"can expand its stomach, so it can swallow prey that's 50% bigger than itself."
00:19:22,00:19:23,"Oh, wow."
00:19:23,00:19:24,Which is so cool.
00:19:24,00:19:25,That's amazing.
00:19:25,00:19:28,"So I just think whenever you say, ""Oh, I can eat my own body size of this,"" he can."
00:19:28,00:19:29,Yeah.
00:19:29,00:19:31,"Very unsuttle, though, if you're invited to a dinner party, and you know sometimes you"
00:19:31,00:19:34,"have a meal before you go and you just fake it and say, ""No, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah,"
00:19:34,00:19:35,"it's not a big deal."""
00:19:35,00:19:36,It's not a big deal.
00:19:36,00:19:37,"You actually really feel, can't hide that."
00:19:37,00:19:42,You've got 50% more body weight coming through the door.
00:19:42,00:19:43,Goldfish.
00:19:43,00:19:44,"Oh, yeah."
00:19:44,00:19:45,Have teeth.
00:19:45,00:19:46,Can't believe it.
00:19:46,00:19:48,How do you think they eat?
00:19:48,00:19:51,I just thought they swallowed things that didn't need chewing.
00:19:51,00:19:53,"Well, they eat like little fishy flakes."
00:19:53,00:19:54,They're not.
00:19:54,00:19:55,"Yeah, I thought it was like..."
00:19:55,00:19:56,They kind of dissolve in the water.
00:19:56,00:19:59,"Yeah, if you open their mouth, you can't see it, but the teeth are at the back of the"
00:19:59,00:20:00,throat.
00:20:00,00:20:02,They just have a set of teeth that do all the old crunching.
00:20:02,00:20:04,"Yeah, right at the back."
00:20:04,00:20:08,"Yeah, that'll often happen, and I always think, ""How does that do contract your throat as"
00:20:08,00:20:09,"a fish?"""
00:20:09,00:20:10,"Because lots of fish have it, don't they?"
00:20:10,00:20:11,There's teeth in the throat thing.
00:20:11,00:20:12,Yeah.
00:20:12,00:20:13,It seems like it'd be very uncomfortable.
00:20:13,00:20:17,"But what's really cool is if you have goldfish at home right now, go and have a look in your"
00:20:17,00:20:20,little aquarium that you have.
00:20:20,00:20:24,"Look at the bottom, because what they'll do is they often lose teeth and they grow new"
00:20:24,00:20:28,"ones, and so either you can catch your goldfish in the act of literally spitting its tooth"
00:20:28,00:20:31,"out, or look at the bottom, there'll be little teeth."
00:20:31,00:20:34,"You should say how often they do, because I worry that someone's going to sit in front"
00:20:34,00:20:37,"of their goldfish tank staring at it for days on end, waiting."
00:20:37,00:20:39,Every seven minutes.
00:20:39,00:20:45,"If you have a pet Pacific Link card, then you might be able to do that, because they"
00:20:45,00:20:48,"gain and lose, on average, 20 teeth every day."
00:20:48,00:20:49,What?
00:20:49,00:20:54,"Yeah, so every day, 20 of the teeth fall out, and 20 new ones grow in the place."
00:20:54,00:20:55,Amazing.
00:20:55,00:20:57,"They are also probably too big for your fish tank, aren't they?"
00:20:57,00:20:59,I think they're about five feet long.
00:20:59,00:21:00,"Oh, they are."
00:21:00,00:21:01,They're obviously on the size of your fish tank.
00:21:01,00:21:06,"They could fit in my pond, if they kind of sped themselves in half."
00:21:06,00:21:09,Have you seen the really horrible sheep's head fish?
00:21:09,00:21:12,"If you haven't seen it, google it, but it is pretty gross."
00:21:12,00:21:13,Wow.
00:21:13,00:21:17,"Basically you've got just human teeth, it's like a big gummy smile, it's very unpleasant."
00:21:17,00:21:21,"And it's not nice human teeth, it's sort of like someone who hasn't cleaned their teeth"
00:21:21,00:21:22,for 20 years.
00:21:22,00:21:27,It's really disconcerting when you see a fish that doesn't have the face of a fish.
00:21:27,00:21:30,"If anyone, I don't know if it's still there, I don't know the lifespan, but about seven"
00:21:30,00:21:34,"years ago, I was in a restaurant in Bow Road, in a Chinese restaurant, they had an aquarium,"
00:21:34,00:21:36,and there was a fish there with a face of a dog.
00:21:36,00:21:38,It just had a dog's head.
00:21:38,00:21:40,It was the weirdest thing.
00:21:40,00:21:44,"Is this one of those restaurants where you go in and you choose the fish, you want them"
00:21:44,00:21:45,to cook?
00:21:45,00:21:47,"Because I reckon if it is, it probably is still there."
00:21:47,00:21:52,"I'll have the dog face, please."
00:21:52,00:21:56,"To be fair, it is possible that maybe a dog was looking through the other side of the"
00:21:56,00:21:57,tank.
00:21:57,00:22:00,Was it a fellow diner's pet?
00:22:00,00:22:03,You can see fish that have human looking teeth as well.
00:22:03,00:22:04,What's it called?
00:22:04,00:22:05,The Paku?
00:22:05,00:22:06,Paku.
00:22:06,00:22:07,You mean as well as the one that Anne's mentioned.
00:22:07,00:22:08,"Oh, is that the Paku one?"
00:22:08,00:22:09,Mine's a sheep's head fish.
00:22:09,00:22:11,"It's called Sheep's Head, but that might be their official name."
00:22:11,00:22:14,"There are more fish than you would think with human looking teeth, but the one that scared"
00:22:14,00:22:17,"me the most, I didn't know dogs could have teeth on their beaks."
00:22:17,00:22:19,You see the Goosander dog?
00:22:19,00:22:22,"Not only that, he lives in the UK, they're everywhere, and they're terrified of this"
00:22:22,00:22:23,dog.
00:22:23,00:22:26,That would be a great animated cartoon for Loosanders to do.
00:22:26,00:22:31,"You've got the Goosanders, which say, ""Shonigan, Joshua Witticombe,"" and Goosanders."
00:22:31,00:22:33,Looking up this line up really well.
00:22:33,00:22:35,"I was thinking, ""Oh, what did you see in the park?"
00:22:35,00:22:36,"Goosander duck?"""
00:22:36,00:22:37,"Oh, really?"
00:22:37,00:22:38,Two things.
00:22:38,00:22:42,Just the one with all the teeth.
00:22:42,00:22:47,"The Paku we mentioned a few seconds ago, they supposedly combined human testicles off."
00:22:47,00:22:49,They're invasive.
00:22:49,00:22:54,"I think you get them in Papua New Guinea or somewhere, and they have come into the Northern"
00:22:54,00:22:59,"Hemisphere more recently, and whenever they catch one, it's always in the news it's like"
00:22:59,00:23:03,testicle-biting fish in the Thames or whatever.
00:23:03,00:23:04,"Oh, really?"
00:23:04,00:23:05,I think it's not true.
00:23:05,00:23:12,"They're vegetarian, so they eat nuts, and the story goes that someone with particularly"
00:23:12,00:23:17,nut-like testicles was standing by the water in Papua New Guinea.
00:23:17,00:23:21,That's the swollen balls that person has got if they've got the consistency of a nut.
00:23:21,00:23:22,It depends what kind of nut.
00:23:22,00:23:25,Are there any nuts that are as soft as testicles out there?
00:23:25,00:23:29,"No, this does sound like one incident, and it's similar to a man going to a hospital"
00:23:29,00:23:35,"saying, ""I don't know how my penis got inside this vacuum cleaner, but..."""
00:23:35,00:23:41,It's an invasive species of Henry Hoover's who supposedly eat penises.
00:23:41,00:23:43,I think there's a little bit of that.
00:23:43,00:23:47,"I think there was one story of some people in Papua New Guinea, and one person possibly"
00:23:47,00:23:53,"had the genitals bitten by this fish, and it has since kind of..."
00:23:53,00:23:55,But what was he doing with that fish?
00:23:55,00:23:57,He was urinating by the side of the lake.
00:23:57,00:23:58,"Yeah, right."
00:23:58,00:24:01,There was a scary story about a fish that would swim up your urine stream.
00:24:01,00:24:02,Was that real?
00:24:02,00:24:03,No.
00:24:03,00:24:04,No.
00:24:04,00:24:05,I feel like they're not.
00:24:05,00:24:06,Can we just establish it?
00:24:06,00:24:09,"There's a big difference, and I feel like tabloids often do this as well in headlines."
00:24:09,00:24:13,"Then you read the text, and James, you may have just done it between bitten and bitten"
00:24:13,00:24:19,"off, and I think it's much less scary to have something bite your arm than to have it bite"
00:24:19,00:24:20,"off your arm, for instance."
00:24:20,00:24:21,Yeah.
00:24:21,00:24:22,"Same with testicles, I would argue as well."
00:24:22,00:24:23,"Yeah, probably it's the same."
00:24:23,00:24:28,I think what I'm saying is that there was a very small little nibble on this man's
00:24:28,00:24:29,genitals.
00:24:29,00:24:30,And it has since...
00:24:30,00:24:31,And it made the national news.
00:24:31,00:24:32,Yeah.
00:24:32,00:24:33,It's snowballed into...
00:24:33,00:24:34,Since...
00:24:34,00:24:36,"Whenever the paku comes to town, everyone's like, ""That's the ball eating fish."""
00:24:36,00:24:40,The other option is that he was bit on the balls by a human and had to quickly come up
00:24:40,00:24:44,"with an excuse for his wife and went, ""No, it was the fish that has human teeth."""
00:24:44,00:24:47,It's called the sheep's head.
00:24:47,00:24:52,"Because someone's human has bitten his balls, he's gone, ""No, no, it was a fish."""
00:24:52,00:24:54,"And she's like, ""Well, you can see the teeth marks."""
00:24:54,00:24:55,They're human.
00:24:55,00:24:56,They're clearly human teeth.
00:24:56,00:24:57,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:24:57,00:24:58,The paku.
00:24:58,00:24:59,It's the paku.
00:24:59,00:25:00,"No, I know you're having an affair."
00:25:00,00:25:05,You're having an affair with someone who gives a very bad blow to us.
00:25:05,00:25:09,I was reading about a different type of mouths that fish can have.
00:25:09,00:25:12,You can have a superior mouth or an inferior mouth.
00:25:12,00:25:13,Okay.
00:25:13,00:25:14,What's your criteria?
00:25:14,00:25:15,That is...
00:25:15,00:25:16,Can you guess what it is?
00:25:16,00:25:17,A superior and an inferior.
00:25:17,00:25:18,"One's on top of your head, I suppose?"
00:25:18,00:25:19,On top of your head?
00:25:19,00:25:21,"Well, because if it's superior, I feel like it's on the top."
00:25:21,00:25:25,How many fish have you seen where the mouth is above the eyes?
00:25:25,00:25:26,"Oh, look."
00:25:26,00:25:27,We've said that...
00:25:27,00:25:28,I bet there are some fish where the mouth is above the eyes.
00:25:28,00:25:29,That was an upside-down fish.
00:25:29,00:25:30,Turn it around.
00:25:30,00:25:32,It was my dead goldfish.
00:25:32,00:25:33,Is it?
00:25:33,00:25:36,You're more or less there in fairness.
00:25:36,00:25:43,A superior mouth is basically imagine a smiling fish and imagine a frowning fish for an inferior
00:25:43,00:25:44,mouth.
00:25:44,00:25:45,"Oh, so it's like whether it turns up or down."
00:25:45,00:25:46,"Yeah, precisely."
00:25:46,00:25:50,"And if you have a superior mouth and you're a smiling fish, then you usually would feed"
00:25:50,00:25:51,on the surface.
00:25:51,00:25:53,So you might get insects from the surface of the water.
00:25:53,00:25:56,"Oh, so you're turning your spoon around to go up or go down."
00:25:56,00:26:00,"And if you're an inferior mouth, you're probably a bottom feeder, as in you're getting stuff"
00:26:00,00:26:01,off the floor.
00:26:01,00:26:05,"And they have terminal mouths like goldfish, which is just at the front."
00:26:05,00:26:09,"So it's neither a smile nor a frown, and they're usually omnivores."
00:26:09,00:26:10,They'll eat all sorts of stuff.
00:26:10,00:26:11,"Oh, that's funny."
00:26:11,00:26:14,It's quite interesting that if you look at a fish and you see whether it's smiling or
00:26:14,00:26:15,"frowning, you can tell how it eats."
00:26:15,00:26:16,Maybe you can't tell their mood.
00:26:16,00:26:17,"No, you can't."
00:26:17,00:26:20,"Because imagine if you're a really grumpy, pessimistic fish, but you've got the superior"
00:26:20,00:26:23,"mouth and you're like, ""Everyone thinks I'm so jolly."
00:26:23,00:26:25,"I'm having the worst day."""
00:26:25,00:26:29,We've never had anybody talk about gnarls before.
00:26:29,00:26:30,"Oh, yeah."
00:26:30,00:26:33,And they're a toothed whale.
00:26:33,00:26:34,Count as a toothed whale.
00:26:34,00:26:35,That's one big tooth.
00:26:35,00:26:36,Yeah.
00:26:36,00:26:37,It's where they think unicorns.
00:26:37,00:26:39,The idea for unicorns came from.
00:26:39,00:26:43,"They found these narwhal tusks and they were like, ""Wow, this must be from a horse."""
00:26:43,00:26:44,"Okay, right."
00:26:44,00:26:46,"But not only is it one big tooth, it's their only tooth."
00:26:46,00:26:50,And it's actually their left tooth.
00:26:50,00:26:53,It's their left canine.
00:26:53,00:26:56,So they all have a right canine that doesn't erupt in their mouth.
00:26:56,00:27:00,"In fact, occasionally you'll see an arwhal where its right one is erupted and it's got"
00:27:00,00:27:02,a double horn thing going on.
00:27:02,00:27:03,"Yeah, right on."
00:27:03,00:27:04,That's cool.
00:27:04,00:27:06,So do the males have really long ones?
00:27:06,00:27:08,"Yeah, females tend not to have them actually."
00:27:08,00:27:09,Really?
00:27:09,00:27:10,At all.
00:27:10,00:27:13,"And what's the, do we know what sort of like the evolutionary reason for them retaining"
00:27:13,00:27:14,just one?
00:27:14,00:27:16,"I think if males have them, it feels like it's sexual selection."
00:27:16,00:27:17,It does.
00:27:17,00:27:20,"But again, bizarrely, given they're quite prominent, we really don't know."
00:27:20,00:27:21,And they've looked at lots of things.
00:27:21,00:27:27,They thought maybe they use it as an ice pick or as a tool for echolocation and...
00:27:27,00:27:31,"Or sort of like a cocktail steak for, you know, how you put sausages and pineapples on and"
00:27:31,00:27:32,cheese and so on.
00:27:32,00:27:36,"And then only for catering, because if it was on your tooth, you couldn't get it in"
00:27:36,00:27:37,your mouth.
00:27:37,00:27:38,That's true.
00:27:38,00:27:39,But you'd not bring it to the mate that you're trying to...
00:27:39,00:27:42,"Oh yeah, like what I've got for you."
00:27:42,00:27:46,"Do you think that's sexy, Dan, if your partner has a really long tooth and you attach some"
00:27:46,00:27:49,pineapple and cheese on and feed it directly into your mouth?
00:27:49,00:27:52,"Is that what, what does it for you?"
00:27:52,00:27:53,That is right.
00:27:53,00:27:54,You know she's got that.
00:27:54,00:27:59,"You've not signed up to my only friend, so I thought you, is that the biggest tooth in"
00:27:59,00:28:00,nature?
00:28:00,00:28:02,"Oh, it is big."
00:28:02,00:28:03,How long can they get to?
00:28:03,00:28:05,"I feel like they can get to a couple of metres, can't they?"
00:28:05,00:28:07,"I think, yeah, I reckon it must be."
00:28:07,00:28:09,It's about half their body length.
00:28:09,00:28:11,"Yeah, 'cause tusks are not teeth."
00:28:11,00:28:13,"Tusks are catering, catering, no."
00:28:13,00:28:14,Caratine?
00:28:14,00:28:15,Caratine.
00:28:15,00:28:16,Caratine.
00:28:16,00:28:20,You're gonna have a word with my drug dealer.
00:28:20,00:28:23,It's doing nothing for me.
00:28:23,00:28:24,My hair looks amazing.
00:28:24,00:28:26,I'm being accused of poaching.
00:28:26,00:28:30,"What's going on, mate?"
00:28:30,00:28:34,"The only thing, other thing could be possibly like other large whales that have got teeth,"
00:28:34,00:28:36,but I reckon that would be the biggest.
00:28:36,00:28:39,"Yeah, it's gotta be up there, yeah."
00:28:39,00:28:44,"Just on the subject of fish teeth, I came across, actually a while ago, and I've been"
00:28:44,00:28:48,"looking for a chance to mention it, an old Russian folktale of a beautiful young woman"
00:28:48,00:28:52,who's married to a really disgusting man that she hates.
00:28:52,00:28:56,Sounds like my marriage.
00:28:56,00:29:01,Tell me how long that continues to be true in this story.
00:29:01,00:29:08,"To put him off having sex with her, she puts a fish head into her vagina so that every"
00:29:08,00:29:11,"time he's up for it, he's like, ""Oh, what are all these teeth?"""
00:29:11,00:29:13,I guess it's one of these goldfish with the teeth heads.
00:29:13,00:29:14,That's the paku.
00:29:14,00:29:21,"It's a paku head, it's specifies, and then she says, ""What, you idiot, all women have"
00:29:21,00:29:22,this.
00:29:22,00:29:23,You don't want to do it.
00:29:23,00:29:24,"You don't want to do it."""
00:29:24,00:29:27,"That's what she's doing, and so he never gets to have sex with her."
00:29:27,00:29:28,"Oh, wow."
00:29:28,00:29:29,That's a shame.
00:29:29,00:29:30,It's a really sad story for him.
00:29:30,00:29:31,"It is, really."
00:29:31,00:29:32,"And for her, he's got a fish."
00:29:32,00:29:33,Yeah.
00:29:33,00:29:35,In places where you shouldn't have fish.
00:29:35,00:29:37,"She's kind of a bit worse off, yeah."
00:29:37,00:29:42,"If she'd have put a soccer mouth catfish up her belly, it might have been better, because"
00:29:42,00:29:43,they have bendy teeth.
00:29:43,00:29:44,"Oh, okay."
00:29:44,00:29:49,"The first fish that we found that have got bendy teeth, because they scrape stuff off"
00:29:49,00:29:54,"rocks, and if they had hard, non-bendy teeth, then they might fall off, or they might break"
00:29:54,00:29:55,or whatever.
00:29:55,00:29:56,That's cool.
00:29:56,00:29:59,"And they reckon that probably more fish have them as well, but we've never found them before."
00:29:59,00:30:02,"So that might be quite nice, some bendy teeth."
00:30:02,00:30:03,Yeah.
00:30:03,00:30:05,"Oh, she'd be so annoyed if she got that one fish."
00:30:05,00:30:07,"She's like, ""Oh, I'm into this."""
00:30:07,00:30:10,"That's, vagina dentata is common in folklore, isn't it?"
00:30:10,00:30:15,"And is it, who's the god in Moana?"
00:30:15,00:30:16,It's Maui.
00:30:16,00:30:17,Maui.
00:30:17,00:30:18,Yeah.
00:30:18,00:30:20,Is it written by some vagina or something?
00:30:20,00:30:25,"Yeah, I think that's not featuring the live-action Moana remake of Disney I'm currently working"
00:30:25,00:30:26,on.
00:30:26,00:30:35,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact."
00:30:35,00:30:40,My fact this week is that a book club in America has finally finished reading Finnegan's Wake
00:30:40,00:30:43,after 28 years of monthly meet-ups.
00:30:43,00:30:45,28 years.
00:30:45,00:30:46,28 years.
00:30:46,00:30:47,Impressive.
00:30:47,00:30:48,It's incredible.
00:30:48,00:30:54,"In 1995, there was between 10 and 30 people who would show up to these monthly book clubs,"
00:30:54,00:30:58,"and Finnegan's Wake is a very complicated, unreadable book."
00:30:58,00:31:02,"They decided, rather than getting through the whole thing and doing it in one book club,"
00:31:02,00:31:04,they would take it two pages at a time.
00:31:04,00:31:09,"That proved to be, I think, a bit too much, so they then brought it down to one page per"
00:31:09,00:31:11,"book club, and they've been doing this."
00:31:11,00:31:14,"They did it, you know, through the pandemic, they've been doing it over Zoom, they keep"
00:31:14,00:31:20,"meeting up, and yeah, they finally just got to the end, but it's being reported as the"
00:31:20,00:31:26,"end, but as the man who runs the book club, a guy called Jerry, pointed out, it ends on"
00:31:26,00:31:30,"a sentence that is a continuous loop sentence, which means you come right back to the beginning"
00:31:30,00:31:31,of the book.
00:31:31,00:31:32,No.
00:31:32,00:31:34,So they're just starting from page one again now.
00:31:34,00:31:35,What a horrible realisation.
00:31:35,00:31:36,That must have been in the last session.
00:31:36,00:31:37,The last day.
00:31:37,00:31:38,Punch and pain.
00:31:38,00:31:39,Thank God.
00:31:39,00:31:42,I never have to see these awful people again.
00:31:42,00:31:43,That's amazing.
00:31:43,00:31:44,But it's amazing.
00:31:44,00:31:47,"Like, the people who've been in and out of this group, one guy dropped out of the group"
00:31:47,00:31:50,"for 20 years and came back, you know, they were still waiting."
00:31:50,00:31:52,"They must have been quite lost, but then I suppose everyone is."
00:31:52,00:31:55,"I think they got through 15 chapters in that time, yeah."
00:31:55,00:31:57,"Yeah, that's the whole point of it, isn't it?"
00:31:57,00:32:00,It's a completely impenetrable book.
00:32:00,00:32:03,"Even people that you would consider to be those who love literature and would, like,"
00:32:03,00:32:09,"be snooty and say, ""No, it's actually a masterpiece,"" all just say, ""It's just lots of words."""
00:32:09,00:32:12,"No one can agree, like, who the main characters are, what the plot is."
00:32:12,00:32:13,Have you dipped into it?
00:32:13,00:32:14,No.
00:32:14,00:32:15,Finnegan's way.
00:32:15,00:32:16,No of all-choice stuff.
00:32:16,00:32:17,I don't know if Anna has.
00:32:17,00:32:18,No.
00:32:18,00:32:23,"Yeah, I think it's amazing that even after all this time, they've read it for 28 years,"
00:32:23,00:32:26,"they won't be able to say what happened, because no one knows what happened."
00:32:26,00:32:27,No one knows.
00:32:27,00:32:28,"It's just, that's so amazing, isn't it?"
00:32:28,00:32:29,It's mad.
00:32:29,00:32:32,"It's almost like an endurance sport rather than a hobby now, isn't it?"
00:32:32,00:32:33,"Like, 28 years."
00:32:33,00:32:34,But this is the thing.
00:32:34,00:32:36,"They're not, like, alone in being a book club that has done this."
00:32:36,00:32:38,They just happen to have possibly gone the longest.
00:32:38,00:32:41,"There's a guy called Sam Slote, who's a historian."
00:32:41,00:32:44,He's an expert at Trinity College Dublin on Joyce.
00:32:44,00:32:45,That's what he looks into.
00:32:45,00:32:49,"And yeah, he was reading the book for 15 years."
00:32:49,00:32:53,"You know, there was other groups that, they all go into, like, just over 10 years."
00:32:53,00:32:55,But this is the longest one so far.
00:32:55,00:32:58,Think of all the books you've missed out on in that time that actually make sense.
00:32:58,00:32:59,"Yeah, that's true."
00:32:59,00:33:01,You can't read all the books in your lifetime.
00:33:01,00:33:02,Yeah.
00:33:02,00:33:04,You might as well stick with one's The Hungry Caterpillar.
00:33:04,00:33:05,Absolute banger.
00:33:05,00:33:06,"Yeah, absolutely."
00:33:06,00:33:08,I just get through that many times in one meeting.
00:33:08,00:33:10,I think this is what Joyce wanted.
00:33:10,00:33:14,"I think he wanted people to dedicate their lives to reading just him, to analyzing him."
00:33:14,00:33:16,"That's quite a big move, isn't it?"
00:33:16,00:33:18,"Like, no, you'll be my book, not only my book."
00:33:18,00:33:19,Yeah.
00:33:19,00:33:20,"Yeah, it is."
00:33:20,00:33:21,It's a statement about what you think of yourself.
00:33:21,00:33:23,"Well, he's kind of done it with certain people."
00:33:23,00:33:24,Yeah.
00:33:24,00:33:25,Yeah.
00:33:25,00:33:28,"You know, your fact, sorry, I meant to say, Dan, is wrong."
00:33:28,00:33:29,"Yeah, I know."
00:33:29,00:33:30,It's a spelling mistake.
00:33:30,00:33:32,"A spelling bit of a spelling mistake, yeah."
00:33:32,00:33:33,Oh.
00:33:33,00:33:34,"Well, technically."
00:33:34,00:33:35,"Oh, I see."
00:33:35,00:33:36,"Yeah, yeah."
00:33:36,00:33:37,"There were punctuation errors, wasn't it?"
00:33:37,00:33:38,Yeah.
00:33:38,00:33:39,Okay.
00:33:39,00:33:40,"It's an apostrophe, yes."
00:33:40,00:33:41,An apostrophe.
00:33:41,00:33:44,I'd actually never noticed this until I went to the Wikipedia page.
00:33:44,00:33:46,There's no apostrophe in it.
00:33:46,00:33:49,So it's not the wake of Finnegan.
00:33:49,00:33:52,It's Finnegan's plural.
00:33:52,00:33:53,Wake.
00:33:53,00:33:54,It's like Finnegan's comma.
00:33:54,00:33:56,"Wake, exclamation mark."
00:33:56,00:33:59,And there's a character called Finnegan in it.
00:33:59,00:34:01,And I believe he's being resurrected.
00:34:01,00:34:02,So it's like he's waking up.
00:34:02,00:34:03,So shouldn't he be the main character?
00:34:03,00:34:06,"I haven't read it either, but I would assume if it's called Finnegan's Wake and you've"
00:34:06,00:34:07,got a Finnegan.
00:34:07,00:34:10,"Well, there are quite a few Finnegan's as well."
00:34:10,00:34:11,"Oh, really?"
00:34:11,00:34:14,"I thought the Finnegan's was just referring to, was like pluralised to be confusing and"
00:34:14,00:34:17,"refer to like Irish people generally, but are there multiple Finnegan's in the book?"
00:34:17,00:34:18,"Well, there are multiple Finnegan's."
00:34:18,00:34:24,I think the collective Irish group being called Finnegan's is the most common explanation
00:34:24,00:34:26,for the lack of apostrophe.
00:34:26,00:34:27,Right.
00:34:27,00:34:31,Some people think it's so that the word wake can mean the awakening and also the wake has
00:34:31,00:34:35,"enough to someone die, so it gives you a nice little bit of uncertainness there."
00:34:35,00:34:39,"Some people think it was a fuck up by Samuel Beckett, who wrote..."
00:34:39,00:34:40,"Wait, sorry?"
00:34:40,00:34:41,Samuel Beckett?
00:34:41,00:34:42,So...
00:34:42,00:34:43,"Well, it's his proofreader."
00:34:43,00:34:44,No.
00:34:44,00:34:45,"Well, Joyce kind of..."
00:34:45,00:34:47,But what do you call it when someone speaks it to you?
00:34:47,00:34:48,Dictators.
00:34:48,00:34:49,Yeah.
00:34:49,00:34:50,Beckett dictated it.
00:34:50,00:34:51,Really?
00:34:51,00:34:52,Yeah.
00:34:52,00:34:53,Or certainly some of it.
00:34:53,00:34:54,Are you mixing transcribing and dictating?
00:34:54,00:34:55,"Oh, perhaps."
00:34:55,00:34:56,What's the difference?
00:34:56,00:34:57,You would dictate...
00:34:57,00:34:58,Can you dictate to someone and then they transcribe what you're saying?
00:34:58,00:34:59,"Oh, I see."
00:34:59,00:35:00,Yes.
00:35:00,00:35:01,I think Joyce is...
00:35:01,00:35:02,Joyce was dictating.
00:35:02,00:35:03,Beckett was transcribing.
00:35:03,00:35:04,Excellent point.
00:35:04,00:35:05,Maybe.
00:35:05,00:35:06,Just maybe five minutes in the edit.
00:35:06,00:35:07,Maybe they weren't there.
00:35:07,00:35:09,Maybe it was always the other way around and Beckett wrote it.
00:35:09,00:35:11,"I was like, ""Don't put my name on that."
00:35:11,00:35:13,"I don't want to be cursed."""
00:35:13,00:35:17,Famous story where Beckett is dictating and there's a knock on the door and James Joyce
00:35:17,00:35:18,"says, ""Come in."""
00:35:18,00:35:21,"And Beckett just writes, ""Come in in the middle of the story."""
00:35:21,00:35:22,"Oh, really?"
00:35:22,00:35:28,"So that was from a biography of Joyce, which where he interviewed Beckett and Beckett said"
00:35:28,00:35:29,this happened.
00:35:29,00:35:34,"But if you look in the text and just control F, you don't have to read the whole thing."
00:35:34,00:35:38,"But if you look in the text and look for the phrase, ""Come in,"" there is no place where"
00:35:38,00:35:41,it's just like an interjection where it doesn't belong.
00:35:41,00:35:46,"So either Beckett made it up or maybe it actually happened and then later on he thought, ""You"
00:35:46,00:35:47,know what?
00:35:47,00:35:48,That was stupid.
00:35:48,00:35:49,"I'm going to take that out."""
00:35:49,00:35:50,Right.
00:35:50,00:35:51,I'm not sure what happened.
00:35:51,00:35:52,Or an editor was like...
00:35:52,00:35:55,I don't think there was much of an editor because there was loads of typos in all of Joyce's
00:35:55,00:35:56,"work, wasn't there?"
00:35:56,00:36:00,That's something that's really interesting because I was reading an article where they're
00:36:00,00:36:05,"saying that basically the way you can read Joyce now, people have been trying to make"
00:36:05,00:36:09,sense of this book so much that they've employed different ways of cleaning it up in order
00:36:09,00:36:10,to make sense of it.
00:36:10,00:36:13,So there's a version out there where people have taken all the typos out so it kind of
00:36:13,00:36:17,"reads a bit more smoother and you're not going, ""What the hell is this word?"""
00:36:17,00:36:21,There's a digital version now where basically everything is hyperlinked.
00:36:21,00:36:25,Therefore you can get an understanding of everything and you find yourself using it
00:36:25,00:36:27,as a repository of all knowledge.
00:36:27,00:36:31,"It's basically a weird encyclopedia where you just go, ""Oh cool, I'm now learning about"
00:36:31,00:36:33,"this random thing by clicking on it."""
00:36:33,00:36:35,So they keep trying to turn it into something useful.
00:36:35,00:36:36,But it's not.
00:36:36,00:36:37,But it's not.
00:36:37,00:36:39,Ultimately it's just not in its own thing.
00:36:39,00:36:44,"The words that he made up in it, there's a hundred letter long word on the first page"
00:36:44,00:36:49,which is the sound of a thunderclap that was heard at the fall of the Garden of Eden.
00:36:49,00:36:51,Are you going to give us the words?
00:36:51,00:36:53,"Yeah, I want to hear the words."
00:36:53,00:37:08,[Singing]
00:37:08,00:37:09,That's close but not quite.
00:37:09,00:37:10,That was pretty good.
00:37:10,00:37:11,That's good.
00:37:11,00:37:12,I felt like there was a storm outside.
00:37:12,00:37:15,I would argue that Boom does the same job.
00:37:15,00:37:19,That would have been your first thing as an editor.
00:37:19,00:37:20,Right.
00:37:20,00:37:21,Boom.
00:37:21,00:37:22,Opening words.
00:37:22,00:37:26,Life would be more difficult for the Vengerbuys if no one had invented the word Boom and
00:37:26,00:37:28,they had to do this four times.
00:37:28,00:37:30,Much less catchy.
00:37:30,00:37:32,"It was reused by Sylvia Plath in the Belcha, that word."
00:37:32,00:37:33,"That word, right?"
00:37:33,00:37:34,Can I see it written down?
00:37:34,00:37:35,"Yeah, it's there."
00:37:35,00:37:37,Are you thinking about using that in your next children's book account?
00:37:37,00:37:38,It's in the title.
00:37:38,00:37:44,It depends if you're on a word count for being paid a number of words or whether you're paid
00:37:44,00:37:46,a number of letters.
00:37:46,00:37:50,"Useful words as well that he made up, which we've already mentioned before, but quark."
00:37:50,00:37:52,Quark is from Finnegan's Wake.
00:37:52,00:37:53,Yes.
00:37:53,00:37:54,The scientific word it's from.
00:37:54,00:37:59,There's a line in it that goes three quarks for muster mark and then quarks can cluster
00:37:59,00:38:01,together in threes to form other.
00:38:01,00:38:03,So that's where...
00:38:03,00:38:08,I think Murray Gellman wanted to call them quarks and he always had this idea of they're
00:38:08,00:38:15,called quarks and then he saw the word quark in Finnegan's Wake where it clearly rhymes
00:38:15,00:38:19,"with mark, but even though he spelt it in the same way that Joyce did, he always pronounced"
00:38:19,00:38:20,it quark.
00:38:20,00:38:23,Do you think he really tediously corrected people whenever they refer to it?
00:38:23,00:38:28,It's really interesting because I always call them quarks having studied physics and I
00:38:28,00:38:32,think 75% of physicists say quark rather than quark.
00:38:32,00:38:35,I can't believe as many as 25% are doing the pretentious.
00:38:35,00:38:36,This is what he wanted.
00:38:36,00:38:37,Quark pronunciation.
00:38:37,00:38:38,"Come on, physicists."
00:38:38,00:38:40,This is very like the laser loser.
00:38:40,00:38:44,"So laser is an acronym, in fact, light, I forgot what it is."
00:38:44,00:38:45,Light amplified.
00:38:45,00:38:46,Yeah.
00:38:46,00:38:48,"And then someone's like actually the light's oscillating, so they should be called losers."
00:38:48,00:38:50,I never heard that.
00:38:50,00:38:53,"Oh, that's great."
00:38:53,00:38:57,"Joyce was particularly upset about World War II, wasn't he?"
00:38:57,00:39:02,"I know none of us liked it, but it was a real bugbear for him because it interrupted the"
00:39:02,00:39:05,publication of his book or he was worried it would get in the way.
00:39:05,00:39:10,"So as discussed, he spent 17 years writing it, which is not that long when you consider"
00:39:10,00:39:16,"how long it takes to read, but he was realizing he was sort of getting close to the end in"
00:39:16,00:39:20,about 1936 and he was getting really stressed out about global conditions.
00:39:20,00:39:24,"At one point he complained to a friend, ""Look, the fact that the world is in such a bad state"
00:39:24,00:39:28,at the moment is really stressful for me because I find it so hard to write being so anxious
00:39:28,00:39:29,"about it."""
00:39:29,00:39:34,"And then when he handed in the manuscript in 1939, he said, ""Please hurry publishing"
00:39:34,00:39:36,"it because war's going to break out and then no one will read my book anymore."""
00:39:36,00:39:37,That is amazing.
00:39:37,00:39:38,That's not why.
00:39:38,00:39:45,"The thing is, if you're going to spend how long, 17, 18 years writing it, the chance"
00:39:45,00:39:49,"of you, it would have to be in the high end period of peace, wouldn't it?"
00:39:49,00:39:53,There's no other time when you're not going to run into some war or other.
00:39:53,00:39:54,You're right.
00:39:54,00:39:59,So I was looking at what the longest book to read by pages rather than complexity.
00:39:59,00:40:00,Oh yeah.
00:40:00,00:40:04,So the longest novel in the Penguin classics and modern classics is In Search of Lost Time
00:40:04,00:40:05,by Marcel Proust.
00:40:05,00:40:06,Yeah.
00:40:06,00:40:10,"It is six volumes, 3,616 pages."
00:40:10,00:40:13,"So in the time it would take you to read it, you could fly from London to Auckland and"
00:40:13,00:40:15,back again and then to Barbados.
00:40:15,00:40:20,But only if you have to not take any breaks and to read one page a minute for that entire
00:40:20,00:40:21,time.
00:40:21,00:40:22,One page a minute.
00:40:22,00:40:23,Yeah.
00:40:23,00:40:25,I bought a copy of that thinking I would read it and it was absolutely massive.
00:40:25,00:40:28,And I started and then I realized that I only had the first volume.
00:40:28,00:40:33,"If this is the first volume, there is no way in the world I'm going to read this."
00:40:33,00:40:36,"Years ago I thought I'd read Oliver Twist and I said to someone, ""Oh, I've just finished"
00:40:36,00:40:37,"Oliver Twist."""
00:40:37,00:40:39,"And they said, ""Oh, did you like the bit about Dodger's Trial?"""
00:40:39,00:40:40,"And I said, ""What trial?"""
00:40:40,00:40:45,And I'd had the bridge version and I didn't realize I really missed out on it.
00:40:45,00:40:50,"You read the transcript of the musical theatre version, Oliver exclamation mark."
00:40:50,00:40:52,"I love the songs, yeah."
00:40:52,00:40:57,"You read as part of fish research or you started reading Curious If You Finish, Les Mis."
00:40:57,00:41:00,"God, I started reading so many things as part of this research."
00:41:00,00:41:03,"In fact, I started reading The Woman in White a few weeks ago and still haven't got to the"
00:41:03,00:41:04,end of that.
00:41:04,00:41:07,"But yeah, Les Mis, I got most of the way through it but I didn't finish it."
00:41:07,00:41:12,"Well, I read Les Mis's 365 chapters, so you can read one a day, which is quite neat."
00:41:12,00:41:15,But not at a leap year or you can have a day off.
00:41:15,00:41:16,Interesting.
00:41:16,00:41:20,"James, have you ever thought about reading fiction for pleasure rather than for the podcast?"
00:41:20,00:41:22,I think you might get to the end of more books.
00:41:22,00:41:23,I really struggle.
00:41:23,00:41:26,"I've got to say, I really struggle to read fiction for pleasure these days."
00:41:26,00:41:27,Really?
00:41:27,00:41:28,Yeah.
00:41:28,00:41:32,"Because I read so much non-fiction for my job, I need like a year off."
00:41:32,00:41:36,What you need is a book club because I started doing a book club and it does force you to
00:41:36,00:41:37,read.
00:41:37,00:41:41,"Yeah, and it forces you to read things that you might not have new books that have come"
00:41:41,00:41:42,out that people have been interested in.
00:41:42,00:41:46,Is that the idea of fiction that you're forced to read stuff and that's why you do it?
00:41:46,00:41:48,"Just it carves out the time for you to do it, which is interesting."
00:41:48,00:41:49,Accountability.
00:41:49,00:41:50,Yeah.
00:41:50,00:41:51,Aren't you in the same book club as Andy though?
00:41:51,00:41:52,I think I've heard about someone from the book.
00:41:52,00:41:53,Yeah.
00:41:53,00:41:54,Is it just Andy's book every week?
00:41:54,00:41:55,It is.
00:41:55,00:41:56,Yeah.
00:41:56,00:41:57,It does feel like a post-apocalyptic world.
00:41:57,00:41:59,I'm living it every time we chat about it.
00:41:59,00:42:01,What was your best book you discovered through book club?
00:42:01,00:42:05,"Silly Plants of the Bell Jar, which I love her poetry and I've never read the book itself."
00:42:05,00:42:06,I've never read the book.
00:42:06,00:42:07,Did you remember this?
00:42:07,00:42:08,Yeah.
00:42:08,00:42:10,Because I haven't read that book and so I was going off Wikipedia that this word was
00:42:10,00:42:11,in it.
00:42:11,00:42:12,"I think it is true, right?"
00:42:12,00:42:16,"Weirdly, I don't remember the word, but you know, you don't remember every detail, right?"
00:42:16,00:42:18,"Well, you might remember a hundred-letter word."
00:42:18,00:42:19,I assumed it was a typo.
00:42:19,00:42:22,"Well, no, but you know, also when you're on a deadline for book club, it's like, ""Fantastic."
00:42:22,00:42:26,What a great word to zoom in on.
00:42:26,00:42:27,It's like the fast lane.
00:42:27,00:42:28,"It's like a travelator."""
00:42:28,00:42:29,They are good.
00:42:29,00:42:31,Aren't you in a book club?
00:42:31,00:42:37,"No, I'm not, but I think what I would like to be in one for is that discovering books"
00:42:37,00:42:38,that you might not know about.
00:42:38,00:42:41,"So I've got some friends who are just so, so good at book recommendations and really"
00:42:41,00:42:44,good at personalizing it to what you like to read.
00:42:44,00:42:48,So I read an article years ago saying that actually there's an argument that you shouldn't
00:42:48,00:42:52,read books that win prizes and the argument being that if you say you're not into Russian
00:42:52,00:42:56,"high society and agriculture, why would you suddenly be so just because it won a prize?"
00:42:56,00:42:58,"So actually, it can put you off books, which actually if you go in and say-"
00:42:58,00:43:01,You're driving war on peace there.
00:43:01,00:43:02,Sorry.
00:43:02,00:43:07,"But what if you aren't into agriculture, aren't into Russian high society but are into people"
00:43:07,00:43:08,being hit by trains?
00:43:08,00:43:09,What do you-
00:43:09,00:43:13,"Well, then I reckon there's somewhere a book shop with that's the category."
00:43:13,00:43:16,I hear Andy's podcast at qi.com/emailpinging.
00:43:16,00:43:21,"How dare you spoil it, Andy?"
00:43:21,00:43:25,"Well, that's good that we're bucking and trying to bit you being in a book club, Dan."
00:43:25,00:43:26,"And I, in fact, am in a book club."
00:43:26,00:43:27,And I'm not.
00:43:27,00:43:28,It's extraordinary.
00:43:28,00:43:33,"I know we know that it's mostly women, but it's 88% of book clubs in America at least"
00:43:33,00:43:35,are all women.
00:43:35,00:43:40,And women generally read quite a lot more fiction than men.
00:43:40,00:43:42,And book clubs are so popular these days as well.
00:43:42,00:43:46,"I think since Oprah Winfrey's book club, they've shot up."
00:43:46,00:43:50,I think there was a survey of women who read at least one book a month that found over half
00:43:50,00:43:53,"of them were in book clubs, which makes sense because when you're reading that often, that's"
00:43:53,00:43:54,why.
00:43:54,00:43:55,"Well, here's a really interesting thing."
00:43:55,00:43:59,"I went to a publishing party not too long ago, and there was an author there who I'd"
00:43:59,00:44:02,met whose book came out at the same time as mine.
00:44:02,00:44:03,She had an American release.
00:44:03,00:44:06,It was a fiction novel called Wayward's Brilliant.
00:44:06,00:44:09,And she was the New York Times bestseller.
00:44:09,00:44:12,And she's an Australian who moved over here.
00:44:12,00:44:13,It's her first debut book.
00:44:13,00:44:14,"I said, ""How?"
00:44:14,00:44:15,How?
00:44:15,00:44:16,You weren't even in America.
00:44:16,00:44:17,"How did that happen?"""
00:44:17,00:44:18,Book clubs.
00:44:18,00:44:22,"She said, ""Publishers desperately try and put their books in positions to get them into"
00:44:22,00:44:23,"book clubs."""
00:44:23,00:44:26,"And she said, ""You sell like 30 a time."""
00:44:26,00:44:27,They're just massive.
00:44:27,00:44:28,How do you...
00:44:28,00:44:30,"What you go around like asking people, ""Are you in a book club?"""
00:44:30,00:44:35,"So you give away a lot of free books and stuff online as e-books, and then it gets a reputation"
00:44:35,00:44:39,and then book clubs pick it up and Reese Witherspoon is the other massive book club in America.
00:44:39,00:44:40,They're also...
00:44:40,00:44:41,Do you mean big famous book clubs?
00:44:41,00:44:42,"Yeah, yeah."
00:44:42,00:44:43,"Sorry, you don't mean just like my book club."
00:44:43,00:44:44,"No, no."
00:44:44,00:44:45,People will not buy my books.
00:44:45,00:44:46,But probably them as well.
00:44:46,00:44:47,Yeah.
00:44:47,00:44:48,"Probably them as well, yeah."
00:44:48,00:44:49,Just books that are heavily marketed or promoted.
00:44:49,00:44:50,Do you know where the biggest book club in the world is?
00:44:50,00:44:51,The biggest in the world.
00:44:51,00:44:52,Okay.
00:44:52,00:44:53,"Yeah, right."
00:44:53,00:44:54,Contender.
00:44:54,00:44:58,"I'm going to say Iceland, because they're famously, they all write books and read novels."
00:44:58,00:44:59,"Oh, yes."
00:44:59,00:45:01,"I feel like you've checked all the book club accounts, but I'm going with volume."
00:45:01,00:45:03,I'm going with the digital world.
00:45:03,00:45:04,Booktalk.
00:45:04,00:45:06,So this is the book club version of TikTok.
00:45:06,00:45:07,"Oh, okay."
00:45:07,00:45:10,So they believe that Booktalk has sold 20 million books in 2021.
00:45:10,00:45:11,Wow.
00:45:11,00:45:12,It's huge.
00:45:12,00:45:13,There's this huge number of books now.
00:45:13,00:45:14,"Colin Hooper, right?"
00:45:14,00:45:16,"Yeah, and they'll say like, ""TikTok made me buy it."""
00:45:16,00:45:18,And it's like these books that just really drive through TikTok.
00:45:18,00:45:21,So much so that they've launched the TikTok Book Awards this year.
00:45:21,00:45:26,"And what I love about this is because TikTok, I guess, is so many people, they're not just"
00:45:26,00:45:28,books that came out this year that were popular in one shop or by one sort of person.
00:45:28,00:45:30,So they gave them a word to Jane Austen.
00:45:30,00:45:31,She got revival.
00:45:31,00:45:32,Yeah.
00:45:32,00:45:34,"So it's like really new stuff, really old stuff."
00:45:34,00:45:39,"Can I ask, yeah, sorry, for like older listeners, not myself, obviously, but for other people"
00:45:39,00:45:43,"who might not really know what TikTok is, can you explain how that works?"
00:45:43,00:45:45,It's not just one book club where everyone reads the same thing.
00:45:45,00:45:46,No.
00:45:46,00:45:50,So TikTok is video sharing and I'm guessing everybody who uses the hashtag Booktalk and
00:45:50,00:45:51,can see what they're talking about.
00:45:51,00:45:55,"So things sort of trend and build and you sort of find, and I guess what's nice about"
00:45:55,00:45:57,"it is if you read a book that you love it and no one else has, you can find someone"
00:45:57,00:45:59,who's made a video and see what they say about it.
00:45:59,00:46:02,Whereas if I've read one book and no one else I know has read it.
00:46:02,00:46:05,"And to be fair, sometimes I finish a book and I'll go onto Goodreads just to see what"
00:46:05,00:46:07,people have said and see if I agree with them.
00:46:07,00:46:08,"Oh yeah, have you seen it?"
00:46:08,00:46:09,Yeah.
00:46:09,00:46:10,Definitely.
00:46:10,00:46:12,"But she has a good like twisty end and I'm like, did I understand that?"
00:46:12,00:46:13,Definitely.
00:46:13,00:46:14,What actually happened?
00:46:14,00:46:15,I'll go and check.
00:46:15,00:46:17,I have a mental reasoning question for you.
00:46:17,00:46:18,Really?
00:46:18,00:46:19,Love these.
00:46:19,00:46:20,Love this book club.
00:46:20,00:46:21,Yeah.
00:46:21,00:46:27,So it was founded in 1996 and the idea was that it would be quite highbrow literary options
00:46:27,00:46:28,that she chose.
00:46:28,00:46:33,"So she had great books in there like William Faulkner, Toni Morrison, Kulman McCarthy."
00:46:33,00:46:39,So really good books over the years and every time she makes a choice it pretty much becomes
00:46:39,00:46:40,a bestseller.
00:46:40,00:46:41,Yeah.
00:46:41,00:46:42,It's like rockets to the top of the charts.
00:46:42,00:46:43,Yeah.
00:46:43,00:46:44,It doesn't exist anymore.
00:46:44,00:46:47,I think it stopped in about 2010 or something.
00:46:47,00:46:48,Okay.
00:46:48,00:46:52,"So whenever she chose a book, book sales actually after that decreased."
00:46:52,00:46:53,Why?
00:46:53,00:46:56,Do you mean book sales more generally?
00:46:56,00:46:58,General book sales decreased.
00:46:58,00:46:59,Okay.
00:46:59,00:47:00,This is why.
00:47:00,00:47:02,Everyone wants you to buy this one particular book.
00:47:02,00:47:05,It went out of print really quickly and no one bought anything else because they were
00:47:05,00:47:07,waiting for that one to come back into print.
00:47:07,00:47:08,Interesting.
00:47:08,00:47:09,Interesting.
00:47:09,00:47:10,Not correct.
00:47:10,00:47:11,Good guess though.
00:47:11,00:47:12,Paper shortage.
00:47:12,00:47:15,It used up so many trees that.
00:47:15,00:47:17,Half of the Amazon Oprah is responsible for destroying actually.
00:47:17,00:47:18,Yeah.
00:47:18,00:47:23,"No, it's specifically about the fact that she chose quite highbrow options but appealed"
00:47:23,00:47:28,to an audience that wouldn't necessarily be reading things like that all the time.
00:47:28,00:47:29,Okay.
00:47:29,00:47:30,So you're.
00:47:30,00:47:31,They spent more time reading.
00:47:31,00:47:32,She got it.
00:47:32,00:47:33,Oh.
00:47:33,00:47:35,So rather than buying two books you buy one and read it for two weeks.
00:47:35,00:47:36,Exactly.
00:47:36,00:47:41,"These people who are buying three books a week and pacing through them, they're suddenly reading"
00:47:41,00:47:42,the Sound and the Fury.
00:47:42,00:47:43,"Oh, that's fine."
00:47:43,00:47:44,Spending a few weeks.
00:47:44,00:47:48,So really everyone should be buying much shorter books and getting through more of them.
00:47:48,00:47:50,How long's your book though?
00:47:50,00:47:51,345 pages.
00:47:51,00:47:53,That's a very big font.
00:47:53,00:47:59,My mind's a children's book so it's a bit short.
00:47:59,00:48:06,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is James."
00:48:06,00:48:11,"Okay, my fact this week is that the liquid in a can of beans is more likely to make you"
00:48:11,00:48:13,farter than the beans themselves.
00:48:13,00:48:14,Okay.
00:48:14,00:48:16,Good to know.
00:48:16,00:48:17,Incredible.
00:48:17,00:48:18,Useful.
00:48:18,00:48:19,Useful knowledge.
00:48:19,00:48:20,Yeah.
00:48:20,00:48:21,Is it?
00:48:21,00:48:23,Are you going to start rinsing all over your mouth?
00:48:23,00:48:28,"No, I'm going to start chugging bean juice because I just want to be more farty."
00:48:28,00:48:32,So this comes from an article on the website Serious Eats and they partnered with Harvard
00:48:32,00:48:37,Science of Cucking Program and looked at the fartiness of various beans and stuff like
00:48:37,00:48:43,that and to see if there were any ways to decrease the effect and they looked at various
00:48:43,00:48:48,old wives tales of how you do this like you soak your beans for ages.
00:48:48,00:48:49,This would not be a can of beans for instance.
00:48:49,00:48:53,You might soak your beans for ages and then cook them in a certain way and see if that
00:48:53,00:48:54,makes sense.
00:48:54,00:48:55,I like that there was someone soaking their Heinsbake beans.
00:48:55,00:48:59,"Everyone always soaks beans so yeah, they're not left them overnight."
00:48:59,00:49:03,They might be cooking them with bay leaves or something like this and nothing really made
00:49:03,00:49:09,any difference but they looked at tinned beans and they did find actually that rinsed beans
00:49:09,00:49:15,from a tin are 20% less farty than unrinsed and that the liquid you throw away is 30%
00:49:15,00:49:17,fartier than the beans are themselves.
00:49:17,00:49:18,Wow.
00:49:18,00:49:19,And why?
00:49:19,00:49:26,So it seems like it kind of seeps into the juice and also the beans they kind of disintegrate
00:49:26,00:49:30,the longer they're in there and the more farty ones are the ones that disintegrate.
00:49:30,00:49:33,"The hard ones that you just kind of go straight through you, they don't disintegrate."
00:49:33,00:49:34,Right.
00:49:34,00:49:38,"So yeah, the fartiness seems to just get into the juice somehow."
00:49:38,00:49:39,That's so interesting.
00:49:39,00:49:42,"I think some things probably work, right?"
00:49:42,00:49:48,"Like there are some things that could counteract the fartiness, there's kombu, the Japanese"
00:49:48,00:49:55,"seaweed that you get in, like kombu dashi, it's an ingredient of that and that has these"
00:49:55,00:50:01,enzymes that break down the sugars in beans when you eat them.
00:50:01,00:50:04,So the reason that beans make you fart is because you can't digest the stuff in them
00:50:04,00:50:07,"but the bacteria in your stomach can, right?"
00:50:07,00:50:14,And then the bacteria as it digests it releases these gases and I believe that kombu manages
00:50:14,00:50:17,to break down those sugars so the bacteria doesn't have as much to eat and fart out.
00:50:17,00:50:18,Correct.
00:50:18,00:50:21,"And so if you add this seaweed to everything, that might work."
00:50:21,00:50:22,Might do.
00:50:22,00:50:23,You better go.
00:50:23,00:50:27,"So actually, you mentioned my book before, I wrote about a guy who tried to stop farts"
00:50:27,00:50:30,from being produced off the back of beans.
00:50:30,00:50:31,"Yeah, he did."
00:50:31,00:50:36,"Yeah, wonderfully, a man called Colin Leakey and Colin Leakey is the son of Mary and Louis"
00:50:36,00:50:41,Leakey who were the great anthropologists who discovered all these hominid skeletons
00:50:41,00:50:42,throughout history.
00:50:42,00:50:46,So he had seen a report of NASA trying to make beans that could be sent into space and
00:50:46,00:50:50,"not produce flatulence, so lose the fart stuff from beans and he thought, yes, that would"
00:50:50,00:50:56,"be amazing to do because if you could invent a bean that gave you less farts, you could"
00:50:56,00:50:59,"have that in developing countries where they sometimes, you know, Crohn's disease, for"
00:50:59,00:51:01,"example, beans are meant to be avoided."
00:51:01,00:51:05,So there's a lot of health implications if you have a lot of wind in you.
00:51:05,00:51:08,"So he thought if I could invent a bean, that could be like a meat replacement and then"
00:51:08,00:51:11,we could have safe eating that's going on for all these poorer countries.
00:51:11,00:51:12,Okay.
00:51:12,00:51:16,So he spent a lifetime doing that and he did invent two beans which are on sale and
00:51:16,00:51:20,have been sent over which are meat replacements and less flatulence.
00:51:20,00:51:24,"So he was a scientist who did great things, but my favorite thing is he patented an invention"
00:51:24,00:51:29,"called the flatometer, which was a device that slots into your rectum and there's a tube"
00:51:29,00:51:33,coming out that connects to a balloon on the other end and you tuck the balloon in your
00:51:33,00:51:37,"shirt pocket and you just collect these, these are his real invention."
00:51:37,00:51:39,"It's bigger, bigger, bigger."
00:51:39,00:51:40,Kind of like the Viperfish.
00:51:40,00:51:45,"At the end of the day you're like, oh, it's children's party ever."
00:51:45,00:51:47,"Yeah, the balloon dog you get given."
00:51:47,00:51:53,So I was reading that they have measured how much volume a fart has and they did it by
00:51:53,00:51:56,feeding everyone beans and using a rectal catheter to catch the fart.
00:51:56,00:51:58,Would you like to guess the mills?
00:51:58,00:51:59,How many mills are average fart?
00:51:59,00:52:01,"It's hard, isn't it?"
00:52:01,00:52:04,Because it's a gas so it spreads out quite a lot so you would think it would be quite
00:52:04,00:52:05,a high mills.
00:52:05,00:52:06,"Yeah, interesting."
00:52:06,00:52:07,572.
00:52:07,00:52:08,What?
00:52:08,00:52:13,"I was going to say more like 20, you're kind of in the middle, 90, so we could fit in your"
00:52:13,00:52:14,airport hand luggage.
00:52:14,00:52:15,Not really.
00:52:15,00:52:17,"I suppose it doesn't count as a liquid, does it, unless you've done a little bit of follow"
00:52:17,00:52:19,through.
00:52:19,00:52:26,"Well, another useful thing scientists have invented, speaking of following through, a useful thing"
00:52:26,00:52:30,scientists have invented is a machine that listens to your bottom and distinguishes a
00:52:30,00:52:32,fart from a shirt.
00:52:32,00:52:33,Ah.
00:52:33,00:52:36,And I would argue you would know without a machine whether that's happened.
00:52:36,00:52:42,"You do usually know, don't you, but often, but do they tell you before or after?"
00:52:42,00:52:46,It actually tells you when it's happened.
00:52:46,00:52:49,"Is it more for when someone's done it, but you're with them and you say, was that a fart"
00:52:49,00:52:50,or a shirt?
00:52:50,00:52:51,"And they say, no, it's just a fart."
00:52:51,00:52:56,"And then you go, let me get my machine out."
00:52:56,00:53:00,"Get to the bathroom, you filthy pig."
00:53:00,00:53:02,It's meant to also detect more than that as well.
00:53:02,00:53:05,So the idea is that you have this device.
00:53:05,00:53:12,"It's called the, and listen carefully, the Synthetic Human Acoustic Reproduction Testing,"
00:53:12,00:53:13,another shot.
00:53:13,00:53:14,Oh.
00:53:14,00:53:15,Yeah.
00:53:15,00:53:21,"And basically it's to give early warning of like colorectal cancers, things like that,"
00:53:21,00:53:25,"bowel cancers, because it's thought that you might have changes in your flatulence sounds"
00:53:25,00:53:27,or in your poo sounds.
00:53:27,00:53:30,"And if it listens, it might then say, oh, your poo sound a bit different these days or"
00:53:30,00:53:31,your fart sound a bit weird.
00:53:31,00:53:34,Have you thought about getting checked out?
00:53:34,00:53:39,And so researchers listen to many hundreds of hours of audio of various pooing and farting
00:53:39,00:53:43,"noises, and then tagged them correctly to train the machine."
00:53:43,00:53:44,Wow.
00:53:44,00:53:49,"And it can now identify whether something's urination, flatulence, solid defecation or"
00:53:49,00:53:52,diarrhea 98% of the time.
00:53:52,00:53:56,"So it's not at the super advanced level yet, I suppose it's still at the stage of distinguishing"
00:53:56,00:53:57,a wee from a poo.
00:53:57,00:53:58,Yeah.
00:53:58,00:53:59,It's not that advanced.
00:53:59,00:54:04,"If you play them, George Osborne's new podcast, it does say it's diarrhea."
00:54:04,00:54:11,"I was just thinking who I could slam if the podcast community wouldn't, wouldn't attack"
00:54:11,00:54:12,us all.
00:54:12,00:54:13,Yeah.
00:54:13,00:54:16,Good luck when he's on next week.
00:54:16,00:54:22,How much do you think the cheapest can of beans you could buy in the UK was in 1996?
00:54:22,00:54:23,"Oh, 1996."
00:54:23,00:54:24,Yeah.
00:54:24,00:54:25,Like 4p?
00:54:25,00:54:26,19?
00:54:26,00:54:27,"Yeah, a couple of p."
00:54:27,00:54:28,A couple of p?
00:54:28,00:54:29,Yeah.
00:54:29,00:54:30,The answer is negative 2p.
00:54:30,00:54:31,"Okay, you take them."
00:54:31,00:54:32,Why?
00:54:32,00:54:33,I'll have 2m.
00:54:33,00:54:37,Did you get like money back for returning the 10 or something?
00:54:37,00:54:38,No.
00:54:38,00:54:44,This was just a crazy moment in retail where it was called the bean wars.
00:54:44,00:54:48,"And basically they were just competing and competing to make the price lower, to win"
00:54:48,00:54:49,the competition.
00:54:49,00:54:53,"Then it got to a point where this one place, which is called Supermarkets, and this place"
00:54:53,00:54:56,called Sanders Supermarket basically had a deal whereby...
00:54:56,00:54:58,It surprised me enough it doesn't exist anymore.
00:54:58,00:55:01,"I was like, oh, I sold too many beans on that bus."
00:55:01,00:55:04,But it went so low that they went into the negatives.
00:55:04,00:55:09,"So if the beans were part of a shopping pile that you had, they took the 2p off of your"
00:55:09,00:55:10,final bill.
00:55:10,00:55:13,"If you were just buying the can of beans, they gave you 2p, but you could only do it"
00:55:13,00:55:15,for one tin.
00:55:15,00:55:16,That was their thing.
00:55:16,00:55:20,But there was a point where you were paid to leave a supermarket with the can of beans.
00:55:20,00:55:24,This is like when you want a sandwich and it's better to get the meal deal than having
00:55:24,00:55:27,to buy a drink as well and then your sandwich is cheaper.
00:55:27,00:55:30,"It is, but it's very rare that you can just take the drink from the meal deal and they'll"
00:55:30,00:55:31,pay you for it.
00:55:31,00:55:34,"The difference that you would have saved, that is unbelievable."
00:55:34,00:55:36,Tesco was selling them at 7p.
00:55:36,00:55:40,Do you think people went around lots of different supermarkets collecting as many 2p's as they
00:55:40,00:55:41,could?
00:55:41,00:55:43,"But if it's 2p and 1 tin, it's quite limited."
00:55:43,00:55:46,So they'd probably lose less money than they would from like huffing the price of like
00:55:46,00:55:47,ketchup or toilet roll.
00:55:47,00:55:48,Totally.
00:55:48,00:55:52,The price of petrol or bus fare to get to the shop is going to be more than 2p.
00:55:52,00:55:56,So it's false economy to go around the country to all of these shops.
00:55:56,00:56:01,But it would feel nice to get your 2p off and get your free beans.
00:56:01,00:56:05,I'm the kind of person who would just always do that for no particular reason.
00:56:05,00:56:06,Don't you need that many beans?
00:56:06,00:56:09,Just going in with different hats on to get more beans.
00:56:09,00:56:12,I'm back again.
00:56:12,00:56:15,I was on the Heinz Factory website because they made beans.
00:56:15,00:56:18,And do you know the average number of beans in a Heinz tin?
00:56:18,00:56:19,"Oh, well what size?"
00:56:19,00:56:20,The normal size.
00:56:20,00:56:21,There are three sizes.
00:56:21,00:56:22,"Wow, three."
00:56:22,00:56:24,"Oh yeah, you've got those mini ones."
00:56:24,00:56:27,"You've got the mini one, the full one, just like 200, 400, and then you've got the snack"
00:56:27,00:56:28,pot.
00:56:28,00:56:29,"Oh, you're so right."
00:56:29,00:56:30,"Yeah, sorry."
00:56:30,00:56:31,"I mean, the normal one."
00:56:31,00:56:34,Showing you too much why I eat for lunch.
00:56:34,00:56:39,And Ann mixes it up every day with a different one.
00:56:39,00:56:45,"Yeah, I'm going to mix it up and have two small pots instead of one big pot."
00:56:45,00:56:46,Five hundred and seventy-two.
00:56:46,00:56:47,That's a good guess.
00:56:47,00:56:50,"We switch sides in the reals, Alice."
00:56:50,00:56:51,The 400s.
00:56:51,00:56:52,The one everyone knows.
00:56:52,00:56:59,"The mainstream one, not your edgy left field, trendy one."
00:56:59,00:57:01,"He's so hipster these days, Ann."
00:57:01,00:57:03,"Okay, standard size of beans."
00:57:03,00:57:08,"I can't believe you now don't know the answer, given your knowledge."
00:57:08,00:57:10,You've bought so much time.
00:57:10,00:57:12,"James, how many did you say?"
00:57:12,00:57:14,Five hundred and seventy-two.
00:57:14,00:57:18,"Okay, I'm going to go, I feel so invested in this now, I'm going to go four hundred and"
00:57:18,00:57:19,twenty-four.
00:57:19,00:57:20,Nice.
00:57:20,00:57:21,"Okay, then, three hundred and sixty-five."
00:57:21,00:57:25,"And you have one, so it's worth something such as what?"
00:57:25,00:57:28,I like Dan's idea of three hundred and sixty-five.
00:57:28,00:57:35,It's like every day I'll have one read and read one chapter of Les Miserables.
00:57:35,00:57:37,It's four hundred and sixty-five on average.
00:57:37,00:57:43,"But the reason I say that is because in twenty-nineteen, a counsellor, Steve Smith, in a break"
00:57:43,00:57:49,"from cheating at Cricket, got back."
00:57:49,00:57:54,"I do think it's a different guy, probably, he got back from a residence meeting late"
00:57:54,00:57:59,"at night, so I'll crack into a can of high-inspired beans and it was full of sauce and contained"
00:57:59,00:58:00,one bean.
00:58:00,00:58:02,I don't remember that.
00:58:02,00:58:03,How crazy that I remember that.
00:58:03,00:58:04,Do you remember the story?
00:58:04,00:58:06,I don't remember that story coming up.
00:58:06,00:58:09,Imagine how farty he would have been the next day.
00:58:09,00:58:10,I know.
00:58:10,00:58:13,"Hungry and farty, it's the worst combo."
00:58:13,00:58:18,"Very randomly, I was in an office the other day, and in through the door came Greg Wallace,"
00:58:18,00:58:21,"who's in MasterChef, that guy."
00:58:21,00:58:22,That's weird.
00:58:22,00:58:26,"Yeah, there was no connection between us two being there."
00:58:26,00:58:29,"He came and just walked up to me and said, ""Wanna hear a bean fact?"""
00:58:29,00:58:32,"And I was like, ""Okay, yeah, sure."""
00:58:32,00:58:34,"I went, ""Oh, I must listen to fish."""
00:58:34,00:58:39,"So at the bean factories, they have a laser which tests out good beans, and if they don't"
00:58:39,00:58:44,"like it, they flick the bean off, so they have a bean flicker at the thing, and I was"
00:58:44,00:58:46,"like, ""Oh, great, that's so cool."
00:58:46,00:58:51,"We could use that on fish or QI,"" and he went, ""Are you connected to that?"""
00:58:51,00:58:56,"I would have assumed this guy's really into food facts, you know, and he just tells anyone."
00:58:56,00:58:58,"He literally opened the door, looked me in the face, walked up to me and said, ""Do you"
00:58:58,00:58:59,"want to hear a bean fact?"""
00:58:59,00:59:02,"Of course, I could have assumed he does."
00:59:02,00:59:04,"Yeah, I genuinely would never have assumed that."
00:59:04,00:59:06,Did people just come up to you randomly?
00:59:06,00:59:09,"If it's Greg Wallace, I would have thought, he knows he's famous, he's like, ""I get a"
00:59:09,00:59:10,"way with doing this to a randomer."""
00:59:10,00:59:13,I can't believe that I'm coming across as the weird one at this time.
00:59:13,00:59:15,You can't cause us very self-involved.
00:59:15,00:59:20,It's all about my podcast.
00:59:20,00:59:22,Greg Wallace is a bean guy.
00:59:22,00:59:23,That's so weird.
00:59:23,00:59:24,It does sound like a dream.
00:59:24,00:59:25,It does.
00:59:25,00:59:26,That is bizarre.
00:59:26,00:59:27,"It does that, though."
00:59:27,00:59:28,It happened.
00:59:28,00:59:30,Would you like to hear a horrifying fart fact?
00:59:30,00:59:33,"Now we're approaching the winter months, so you know on a cold day if you breathe out,"
00:59:33,00:59:34,you can see your breath.
00:59:34,00:59:35,Yeah.
00:59:35,00:59:39,"Well, if you fart loudly enough, you can see your fart on a cold day, but not if you're"
00:59:39,00:59:40,wearing trousers.
00:59:40,00:59:41,"Yes, okay."
00:59:41,00:59:45,"But only a part of like, Winnie the Pooh that is like, ""Winnie the Pooh."""
00:59:45,00:59:48,And I think I've read that story.
00:59:48,00:59:52,"Winnie the Pooh on a windy day, that's what that was about, isn't it?"
00:59:52,00:59:54,"Yes, another reason not to go out in public naked, eh?"
00:59:54,00:59:56,I never realized that.
00:59:56,00:59:59,"There must be footage on YouTube of people doing that, right?"
00:59:59,01:00:02,"I haven't searched it, but feel free to check it out."
01:00:02,01:00:05,I rather think it might be on more specialist channels than YouTube.
01:00:05,01:00:07,Back to Dan's Only fans.
01:00:07,01:00:10,"Yeah, that's a new whole threat for me."
01:00:10,01:00:13,And wiki farts.
01:00:13,01:00:20,"Okay, that's it."
01:00:20,01:00:21,That is all of our facts.
01:00:21,01:00:25,We have now reached the by Anne period of the podcast today.
