00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish!

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:13,200
 Andrew Hunter Murray is off on his hollybops, sailing the seven seas, looking for new unbeknownst

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,520
 species of moss and while he is away, we have got a guest for you and that guest is none

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,960
 other than Anne Miller.

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,880
 Of course you know Anne, she's one of the QIL, she's a really good friend of ours and

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,680
 it's great to have her back.

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,800
 One thing you really need to know about Anne especially in these weeks upcoming to Christmas

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,000
 is that she is also a published author, she has written a series of children's books,

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,800
 they are known as Mickey and the Animal Spies, they're known as that because that is their

10
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,760
 name and they're absolutely brilliant, my daughter absolutely loves looking at the pictures

11
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,800
 and I'm sure when she gets to the right age she will enjoy reading them as well.

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,800
 While we're on the subject of books, of course it would be remiss of me not to mention our

13
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,680
 book, Mine and Anna's new book, Everything to Play for the QI Book of Sport, definitely

14
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,640
 buy that for your loved ones for Christmas, anyone who likes sport, definitely buy it

15
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,640
 for them.

16
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,880
 If you don't like sport but you like what we do, I promise you'll love this book because

17
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,400
 it's full of loads of interesting human stories, drama, it's the ultimate sports book for people

18
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,360
 who don't really like sports and also people who do like sports will like it as well.

19
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,240
 It's for everyone, that's the great thing about our book but then that also has to be

20
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,440
 true of Andy and Dan's books, you definitely should go and get those as well.

21
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:28,880
 Dan's book is called The Theory of Everything Else, it's a brilliant look into his brain,

22
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,640
 his unique brain let's say but he's looked at the history of people who had done otherwise

23
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:41,280
 great things but deep down they had a dark secret of believing some weird shit and speaking

24
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,920
 of weird shit you should also have a look at Andy's books, Andrew Hunter Murray he has

25
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,640
 two books they're called The Sanctuary and The Last Day, they're both brilliant acerbic

26
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,000
 dystopian books that tell you something about the modern day while thrilling you with an

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,440
 incredible story about the future, they're absolutely amazing, you've got to get those

28
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,440
 as well.

29
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,960
 Basically what I'm saying is who doesn't love a book for Christmas and there's a ton

30
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:09,160
 of them made by your favourite QILs that are all available online and mine and as Dan's

31
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,180
 and Andy's you can find at noteswiththingsafish.com/books.

32
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:18,400
 One more very very important thing I need to say before I leave you in peace to listen

33
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,760
 to the podcast is that we do have a couple of live shows coming up just before Christmas,

34
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,120
 they will take place in London on Thursday the 7th of Friday the 8th of December at the

35
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:33,320
 Soho Theatre, now we've already mentioned this to the clubfish members and I think it's

36
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,960
 been on social media so the truth is there are not many tickets left.

37
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:45,300
 If you do want to come and see this show, literally pause now and go to noteswiththingsafish.com/live,

38
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,980
 click on the link and check if there are any tickets left, you never know sometimes extra

39
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:53,060
 tickets do come up closer to the date so do go and check there anyway and hopefully see

40
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,380
 some of you there for our Christmas shows.

41
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,820
 Anyway thank you so much for getting to the end of this without fast forwarding, if you

42
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:04,220
 have fast forwarded and got to here without hearing the last bit, shame on you.

43
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:09,060
 But anyway it's time for our podcast with Anmela so there is nothing more to say apart

44
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:16,360
 from on with the podcast!

45
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:32,640
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming

46
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,060
 to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

47
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:39,860
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, James Harkin and Ann

48
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:43,960
 Miller and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

49
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:48,500
 from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go!

50
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,500
 Starting with fact number one and that is Anna.

51
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:58,580
 My fact this week is that a list of adorable things written over a thousand years ago includes

52
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:04,560
 chicks who look like their clothes are too big for them and faces drawn on melons.

53
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:13,120
 Can I ask for definitions of chicks and melons because I live in the 1990s.

54
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:19,400
 Right, both chicks and melons mean what they've meant in every decade outside of the 1990s.

55
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:29,220
 I'm afraid, baby chickens and fruit.

56
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,620
 People are writing about adorable things a thousand years ago, that's weird.

57
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,100
 I actually heard this reference on radio for this week so I'm sure there are people who

58
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,100
 also heard it mentioned it.

59
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:44,060
 It's the pillow book which is this extraordinary book written by a woman in Japan in the tenth

60
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:52,880
 century and the Haiyan period and that's why we chose this.

61
00:04:52,880 --> 00:05:00,240
 God, it took me a long time to find a Haiyan period.

62
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:07,440
 Anyway, this woman basically wrote a diary of just random stuff that popped into her

63
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,180
 head of lists and observations and things she thought should happen and shouldn't happen

64
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:16,120
 and things people should wear and shouldn't wear and one of them was his list of really

65
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,880
 cute things and one of them was faces drawn on melons, one of them was chicks who look

66
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,560
 like their clothes are too big which I think is like if you see a chick but its feathers

67
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,880
 look like they're a bit swollen, you know they look like they look like you dress them

68
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,880
 up in human clothes.

69
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,880
 That's what I thought.

70
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,880
 That's cute.

71
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,880
 That would be even cuter.

72
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,960
 From what I could tell from interpretations of it, I think they're just talking about

73
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,480
 chicks who look like they don't fit into their clothes yet.

74
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,480
 Right.

75
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,480
 They're too small.

76
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,040
 That's slightly less cute than like a hat and dungarees.

77
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:48,840
 Well, take it up with, say, Shonagun, the author of this book, maybe she hadn't thought

78
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,840
 of that.

79
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,700
 The good thing about this book is, and I'm sure you all found this reading it, it's

80
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,980
 just like someone is writing today, isn't it?

81
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:55,980
 Yeah.

82
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,980
 It's just like this cute thing.

83
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:01,380
 So one is a young palace page, obviously that's not the thing anymore, but a young

84
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:07,200
 palace page who is still quite small and walks by in ceremonial costume and that's just

85
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:12,360
 like if you go to a wedding and you see a little toddler, a page boy in a suit.

86
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,360
 Yeah.

87
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,360
 It's true.

88
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,360
 But it's not all happy stuff, is it?

89
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,120
 There's so many great pissed off lists, things like things that are unpleasant to hear, someone

90
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,840
 who has an ugly voice yet speaks and laughs without restraint, so she has a list for that.

91
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,960
 She has a list for things that give a pathetic impression.

92
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:33,560
 The voice of someone who blows his nose while he is speaking, the impression of a woman

93
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,280
 plucking her eyebrows, it's all so odd.

94
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,800
 My favourite random one in there is the list of extremely frightening things, do you guys

95
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,800
 know?

96
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,800
 No, I didn't see that.

97
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,400
 It's thunder, yeah, fair enough, and I just enjoy this one, extremely frightening thing,

98
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,640
 when a thief has entered the house next door, one is extremely frightened.

99
00:06:53,640 --> 00:07:01,800
 If he breaks into the house where one is actually living, if he breaks into the house where one

100
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,240
 is actually living, one loses consciousness and knows nothing more, which is true.

101
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,240
 That's true.

102
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,720
 So I think some of these, they sound like stand up routines.

103
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,720
 Yeah, exactly.

104
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,240
 It's like, I've found one which is things that are infuriating, which sounds like it's

105
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,800
 like a Josh Whittacum routine, it says, "This is what's infuriating.

106
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,920
 Someone suddenly falls ill and an exorcist is sent for.

107
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:27,040
 They don't find him in the usual place and a tedious amount of time is spent waiting

108
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,280
 while they go around in search of him.

109
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,800
 Finally, they manage to locate him and with great relief, you see him to performing the

110
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,120
 exorcism rites.

111
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,800
 However, the recent exertions of exercising some other possessive spirit seems to have

112
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,800
 worn him out.

113
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,640
 For no sooner does he sit down and start in on the chanting than his spirit seems to

114
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:51,040
 have worn him out, his voice goes drowsy, and that is utterly infuriating."

115
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,040
 I think.

116
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,040
 It's so relatable, isn't it?

117
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,040
 Yeah.

118
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,040
 My note for Josh may be broad, isn't it?

119
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,040
 A tiny bit.

120
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,040
 I like the idea this is a, "Hey, what about airplane food?"

121
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,040
 It clearly is.

122
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,040
 There's a list.

123
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,040
 Rare things.

124
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,360
 A silver tweezer that is good at plucking out the hair.

125
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,360
 This is today.

126
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,360
 It is.

127
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,920
 You can't get tweezers that pluck out hairs well.

128
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,960
 How have they not designed this in the last thousand years?

129
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,560
 It's basically shots of miscellany, isn't it?

130
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:21,980
 Because it is list, but it's also essays sometimes, or diaries, yeah, diary entries, observations.

131
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,720
 So this is, just to put it into the period, I know everyone probably knows the years of

132
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:33,500
 the high Anne period, but we're talking the year 1000 is what's going on here.

133
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,880
 And at the time that she was writing this book, Beowulf was being written also, just

134
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,440
 to put in context the other great pieces of literature.

135
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,440
 Not nearly as relatable, Beowulf.

136
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,440
 No.

137
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,440
 No, that's true.

138
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,440
 I haven't actually read it, so I...

139
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,520
 Well, the first word in it, we still don't know what it means.

140
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,520
 Really?

141
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,520
 I think so.

142
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,520
 Wow.

143
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,520
 Really?

144
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,520
 Yeah.

145
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,520
 Do you say the word?

146
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,520
 Do you know it?

147
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,520
 It's like, "What?"

148
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,520
 Yeah.

149
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,520
 And she was, so she was working in the court of the empress at the time.

150
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:04,240
 She was like a lady-in-waiting who was always there, and she basically wrote this book because

151
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,080
 she just had a lot of spare time with nothing to do.

152
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,800
 So she never intended it for publication.

153
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,880
 It was just a personal book that she was writing.

154
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,360
 We don't even properly know her name.

155
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,520
 So she's called, say, Seanagun, but that's, Seanagun is the title that you're given.

156
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,080
 It's a minor counselor.

157
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:25,320
 And "say" is the name that was added later, which refers to her father's name, so you

158
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,320
 can distinguish her from the other Seanaguns who were in part of the court.

159
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:34,160
 So do we think it could be Josh Whittacum gone back in time to the Haiyan period?

160
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,600
 It's possible.

161
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,600
 Say Seanagun.

162
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,160
 Does that sound like a Japanese version of Josh Whittacum?

163
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,160
 Yeah.

164
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,160
 That's what I was thinking.

165
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:45,280
 The word "haiyan" means "peace" in Japanese, because it was particularly, it was quite

166
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,960
 long period, and it was a time where there wasn't much war going on, so people had time

167
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,160
 to write these stand-up routines.

168
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,160
 That's why she was so bored.

169
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,560
 I reckon she craved a war.

170
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,880
 Do we think she was a bit of a bitch?

171
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,880
 Was she?

172
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,880
 What?

173
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,880
 Well, I mean, just from what she writes.

174
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,880
 I mean, like, adorable things.

175
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,880
 Give us some examples.

176
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,880
 I mean, the...

177
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,880
 Pretty much, list your reading.

178
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,880
 Yeah, you're right.

179
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,880
 I think she had mean qualities.

180
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:10,640
 In fact, there was a story about her where one of her neighbor's houses burned down and

181
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,280
 they lost everything they owned.

182
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,080
 The fire in the house next door is the most scary thing.

183
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,080
 That guy wasn't in her house.

184
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:22,440
 Well, I don't know how scary she was finding it, because basically she wrote a kind of

185
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,200
 little note mocking this person.

186
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,200
 Right.

187
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,200
 He's lost everything.

188
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,960
 He's standing outside his house, you know, naked, and gives it to her mum and says, "Hey,

189
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,600
 go give this note, taking the piss out of this guy to him."

190
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,600
 Okay.

191
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,080
 She had what was effectively a lot of people claim was a rival.

192
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:43,680
 I don't think we fully know that, but it is someone who is friend of the podcast, Murasaki

193
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:49,240
 Chikibu, who wrote, and we mentioned in episode 63 of Fish, The Tale of Genji.

194
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,240
 The Tale of Genji.

195
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,860
 Yeah, the first ever novel, which finished mid-sentence, right, like it just cuts off.

196
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:59,960
 What happened was is that Sei Shonagun was working for this empress, and at the time

197
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,200
 it was one emperor, one empress, that's how it worked, but they bucked the trend with

198
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,400
 this one, and suddenly she was no longer the exclusive empress.

199
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:11,360
 So he got married again, and the lady-in-waiting who became the lady-in-waiting for the next

200
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,080
 lady was this person, The Tale of Genji.

201
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,080
 No way.

202
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,080
 Yeah.

203
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:20,360
 So that's why they were kind of like in rival land, according to certain historians.

204
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:27,640
 So that book, The Tale of Genji by Murasaki, has a word, kawayushi, which is the word which

205
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:33,880
 turned into the modern-day word, kawaii, which means cute in Japanese.

206
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:39,560
 And this idea of, you know, lots of cute animals, and, you know, Hello Kitty and all that kind

207
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,840
 of stuff.

208
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:45,480
 This is kind of a 20th century thing that we're not sure exactly, there's lots of reasons

209
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,840
 why it might have come about, but possibly a reaction to the war, to the bombs, stuff

210
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,840
 like that.

211
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:55,040
 People wanted to go from the horrors of war to cuteness, but definitely seems to have

212
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,120
 become popular when mechanical pencils came out.

213
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:03,360
 So you know those pencils that kind of, you know, you twist them and the blood comes out.

214
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,360
 Twist them?

215
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,360
 Do you not click them?

216
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,720
 Or the one where you take the little one out and put it in the top?

217
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,200
 Do you remember them from Proud Boys' Girl?

218
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,200
 There's so many different ones.

219
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,640
 Hang on, you have to, there's a little pocket containing this.

220
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,480
 Inside the, where like the leg would go, there were like tiny little things and you pop one

221
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,840
 out of the bottom and pop it in the top to save you from opening your pencil.

222
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,440
 I hated them all because they write so horribly, so...

223
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:29,480
 Well, they were very popular in 1970s Japan, where you would not have fit in.

224
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:34,680
 Because they could write very, very thin lines and it inspired a kind of writing among teenage

225
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:39,080
 girls where they would put like lots of little hearts and little, you know, characters and

226
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:46,360
 stuff in their writing and it was so popular and it made the writing so difficult to read

227
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,000
 that it was banned in loads of schools.

228
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 Right.

229
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,720
 Basically, you weren't allowed to write in this kawai style, but by then the trend had

230
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,720
 already taken off.

231
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,000
 I guess once you've started doing it, it sort of becomes your hand, like there were some

232
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,360
 people who would do like proper circles over their eye or like little hearts.

233
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,360
 And I was like, "Why?

234
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,360
 It takes a little bit longer!"

235
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:07,040
 I was just going to ask, "And were you a heart to blow the eye?"

236
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,040
 I barely dot my eyes!

237
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,040
 Your eyes are just a line.

238
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,840
 You don't have time for that dot.

239
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,840
 And but it's not...

240
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:20,440
 I was reading a sort of paper on it saying it's not as cutesy as maybe our version of

241
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,560
 cute, like it's got a bit of an edge, so...

242
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,560
 The kawaii cute.

243
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,560
 The kawaii cute, yeah.

244
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:29,400
 The Japanese cute, which you can kind of see, there's sometimes a bit of a dark edginess

245
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,400
 to it.

246
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:35,400
 There's a character called Gloomy the Naughty Grizzly, who I hadn't come across, but apparently

247
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,520
 that's a big cultural phenomenon.

248
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:42,800
 And he's a two meter tall, like cuddly bear, but he's very violent.

249
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,880
 He's covered in blood quite a lot of the time.

250
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,800
 He attacks his owner quite a lot.

251
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,560
 And that's kawaii in Japan, but not necessarily something we would say was cute.

252
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:55,800
 I think that's like Kimo kawaii, so it's like grotesque and cute at the same time.

253
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,680
 I think that's what they call it.

254
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,600
 And yeah, obviously they have loads of mascots, don't they, in Japan.

255
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:08,260
 In 2015, the governor of Osaka complained that he couldn't recognise most of his prefectures

256
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,260
 mascots.

257
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,760
 They had 92 of them.

258
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,760
 Wow.

259
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,280
 In Osaka alone.

260
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,760
 And he ordered a cull.

261
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,080
 And 20 of his characters were - oh, wow.

262
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,280
 Murdered by the grizzly bear.

263
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,760
 Public executions, I hope.

264
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:29,580
 He made a list, like, 20 mascots that really annoy me, and then I - yeah.

265
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,460
 It's amazing how successful it was, though.

266
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:35,340
 You know how, when governments try to be cool, you know, like David Cameron saying he sports

267
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:38,160
 Aston Villa or whatever, and it's just massive cringe.

268
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,640
 But the Japanese government, basically in the '90s, did, like, cool Japan, which was

269
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:48,720
 a bit like we had cool Britannia here, and cool Japan was the idea of exporting all this

270
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,720
 Japanese cultural stuff.

271
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,920
 And they don't know how they did it, but they nailed it, because it's so popular now, isn't

272
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,920
 it?

273
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,320
 You get people who are really into manga, really into those styles.

274
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,760
 Hello Kitty is a global phenomenon.

275
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,760
 Hello Kitty.

276
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:03,060
 Well, like in the cool Britannia was like Blair versus Oasis, and do you think in Japan

277
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:06,680
 now kids are listening to what's a starry morning glory?

278
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,680
 Yeah.

279
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,680
 Oh, yeah.

280
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,680
 It's still Blair and Oasis.

281
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,680
 Is it?

282
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,680
 Yeah, yeah.

283
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,680
 It's not resolved.

284
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,680
 Yeah.

285
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,680
 Hang on, but are Blair and Oasis popular there?

286
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,680
 I think it's now.

287
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,680
 It's not by saying that.

288
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,680
 Not anymore.

289
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,000
 Damn, it'd be great if they were, because that would be my cultural homeland.

290
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,780
 That's when I stopped learning about pop music, was it about 1998?

291
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:26,180
 Yeah, wouldn't it be great if there was, like, a little museum somewhere where you could

292
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:31,680
 go, and they're still listening to all your kind of, it's called, smoother fans.

293
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,320
 Blair Oasis.

294
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,840
 Oh, God.

295
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,020
 Cuteness is a funny thing, isn't it?

296
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,960
 And we are the cutest of the primates.

297
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,720
 So that's nice for us.

298
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,720
 Officials.

299
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,720
 We're self-proclaimed.

300
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,720
 Officials.

301
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,000
 I guess it is self-proclaimed, because we're the only ones who can write about it.

302
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,520
 We're any of the bonobos allowed to vote in this?

303
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,760
 Screw you, gorillas.

304
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,760
 You can't read.

305
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,120
 You can't define what's cute.

306
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:59,340
 You know, what's kind of defined as cute is the traits that are common in infants.

307
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:03,220
 And that is, it was actually defined by this guy called Conrad Lorenz, who won a Nobel

308
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,220
 Prize.

309
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:09,940
 It's called the Kinder Schema, and it's a large brain capsule, as he puts it, big forehead,

310
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,380
 I think we'll call it.

311
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:17,340
 Large and low-lying eyes, bulging cheeks, short and thick extremities, a springy elastic

312
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:21,660
 consistency and clumsy movements, which is, like, the ugliest way to describe what is

313
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,660
 actually a really cute image.

314
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,660
 Oh, yeah, image.

315
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:27,280
 Oh, wasn't there, there was a thing I read a while ago about, about animals who found

316
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,400
 those cute, like an elephant, like caressing people, and they think, like, oh, you're just

317
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,400
 so cute and small.

318
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,400
 It was really lovely.

319
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,320
 I don't know if I want to be caressed by an elephant, you know, of all the animals that

320
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,320
 could caress me.

321
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,320
 It may not.

322
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,320
 I think there's an elephant.

323
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,320
 I feel like I have a trunk involved.

324
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,320
 That sounds likely.

325
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,360
 They're quite empathetic elephants, aren't they?

326
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,640
 One of the scariest things is an elephant caressing next door's baby.

327
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,640
 Absolutely terrifying.

328
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:57,060
 There was a study done in 2009, and this was, they gave people a load of cute images, and

329
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,620
 then they asked them to play the game Operation.

330
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:03,860
 So you know where you have, like, a plastic body, and you have to pull out the funny bone

331
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,900
 and stuff so that it doesn't buzz.

332
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,980
 Well it turned out that anyone who'd been exposed to high cuteness stimuli was better

333
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,980
 at Operation.

334
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,980
 Ah.

335
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:15,780
 So first of all, a tip for Christmas, if you go home and someone's got Operation, have

336
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:19,580
 a quick look at some kawaii stuff before you play, and it'll help.

337
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:23,960
 But secondly, it's due to extreme carefulness, and the idea is you've seen lots of cute things,

338
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,840
 you want to look after them almost, and you want to be more careful.

339
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,840
 Right.

340
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:32,000
 But don't look at the bloodied bear, because that might give you the impression that blood

341
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,800
 all over your Operation human is going to be...

342
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,800
 Adorable.

343
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,800
 Adorable.

344
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,720
 You heard, like, 4D operation as a kid, damn, that'd be all blood.

345
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,760
 Are you guys in use of all blood?

346
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,760
 Oh my God.

347
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:53,940
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anne.

348
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:58,620
 My fact is that the Viperfish has teeth that are so long it can't close its mouth properly

349
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,420
 or it would impale its own brain.

350
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,420
 Hmm.

351
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,940
 I bet there are a few that have, though.

352
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:08,020
 Yeah, the idiot kids, the Darwin-award Viperfish.

353
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,020
 Exactly.

354
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:12,340
 But so have they sort of evolved, like, the equivalent of a doorstopper?

355
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,340
 They have.

356
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:16,000
 So basically, they're very, like, very long and silver, and they've got these lighty-up

357
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,140
 spots along the bottom of their stomach, and then they have these huge teeth that kind

358
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:24,800
 of pierce upwards from their jaw, and luckily it doesn't impede their hunting, because to

359
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,920
 hunt it basically just swims around with its mouth open until it finds prey.

360
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:32,680
 It can unhinge its jaw and rotate its skull, so when it finds prey it just basically swims

361
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,520
 straight at it, and then it clamps its teeth shut like a cage and holds them in its mouth

362
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,520
 and then eats them.

363
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,520
 Hmm.

364
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,520
 It can close its mouth, so...

365
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,120
 The teeth are coming out, so it's like making a seal, so they're kind of like having a very

366
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,120
 extreme overbite.

367
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:49,240
 Yeah, because I know there's another fish called the common fangtooth, which, as its

368
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:54,240
 name might suggest, has fangy teeth, and what they have is they have special sockets on

369
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,120
 either side of their brain so that when they close their mouth, their teeth go into those

370
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,120
 sockets.

371
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,120
 Well, that is nice.

372
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,120
 Isn't that amazing?

373
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,120
 Yeah.

374
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,120
 It's so precise with the pockets.

375
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,460
 I think, like, if you got punched in the jaw and that was slightly dislocated, the first

376
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:09,480
 time you tried to shut your mouth, it would then miss the holes and pierce you in the

377
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,480
 brain.

378
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,480
 That would be...

379
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,980
 That's why there's no boxing in the fangtooth community.

380
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,980
 I think that's correct.

381
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:14,980
 Yeah.

382
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:18,440
 But Biprofish is really cool, so as well as being able to get its prey in this cage, it

383
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,320
 can expand its stomach, so it can swallow prey that's 50% bigger than itself.

384
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,320
 Oh, wow.

385
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,320
 Which is so cool.

386
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,320
 That's amazing.

387
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,480
 So I just think whenever you say, "Oh, I can eat my own body size of this," he can.

388
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,480
 Yeah.

389
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,680
 Very unsuttle, though, if you're invited to a dinner party, and you know sometimes you

390
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,960
 have a meal before you go and you just fake it and say, "No, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah,

391
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,960
 it's not a big deal."

392
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,960
 It's not a big deal.

393
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,960
 You actually really feel, can't hide that.

394
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:42,460
 You've got 50% more body weight coming through the door.

395
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,460
 Goldfish.

396
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,460
 Oh, yeah.

397
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,460
 Have teeth.

398
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,460
 Can't believe it.

399
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,500
 How do you think they eat?

400
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,980
 I just thought they swallowed things that didn't need chewing.

401
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,460
 Well, they eat like little fishy flakes.

402
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,460
 They're not.

403
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,460
 Yeah, I thought it was like...

404
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,460
 They kind of dissolve in the water.

405
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:59,500
 Yeah, if you open their mouth, you can't see it, but the teeth are at the back of the

406
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,500
 throat.

407
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,900
 They just have a set of teeth that do all the old crunching.

408
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,500
 Yeah, right at the back.

409
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,520
 Yeah, that'll often happen, and I always think, "How does that do contract your throat as

410
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,520
 a fish?"

411
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,520
 Because lots of fish have it, don't they?

412
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,520
 There's teeth in the throat thing.

413
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,520
 Yeah.

414
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,520
 It seems like it'd be very uncomfortable.

415
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,120
 But what's really cool is if you have goldfish at home right now, go and have a look in your

416
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,200
 little aquarium that you have.

417
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,440
 Look at the bottom, because what they'll do is they often lose teeth and they grow new

418
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,400
 ones, and so either you can catch your goldfish in the act of literally spitting its tooth

419
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,280
 out, or look at the bottom, there'll be little teeth.

420
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,320
 You should say how often they do, because I worry that someone's going to sit in front

421
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,020
 of their goldfish tank staring at it for days on end, waiting.

422
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,540
 Every seven minutes.

423
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:45,340
 If you have a pet Pacific Link card, then you might be able to do that, because they

424
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:48,180
 gain and lose, on average, 20 teeth every day.

425
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,180
 What?

426
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:54,460
 Yeah, so every day, 20 of the teeth fall out, and 20 new ones grow in the place.

427
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,460
 Amazing.

428
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,940
 They are also probably too big for your fish tank, aren't they?

429
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,340
 I think they're about five feet long.

430
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,340
 Oh, they are.

431
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,700
 They're obviously on the size of your fish tank.

432
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:06,520
 They could fit in my pond, if they kind of sped themselves in half.

433
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,960
 Have you seen the really horrible sheep's head fish?

434
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,820
 If you haven't seen it, google it, but it is pretty gross.

435
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,820
 Wow.

436
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:17,700
 Basically you've got just human teeth, it's like a big gummy smile, it's very unpleasant.

437
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:21,280
 And it's not nice human teeth, it's sort of like someone who hasn't cleaned their teeth

438
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,280
 for 20 years.

439
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:27,160
 It's really disconcerting when you see a fish that doesn't have the face of a fish.

440
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,260
 If anyone, I don't know if it's still there, I don't know the lifespan, but about seven

441
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:34,620
 years ago, I was in a restaurant in Bow Road, in a Chinese restaurant, they had an aquarium,

442
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,900
 and there was a fish there with a face of a dog.

443
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,940
 It just had a dog's head.

444
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,940
 It was the weirdest thing.

445
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:44,460
 Is this one of those restaurants where you go in and you choose the fish, you want them

446
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,460
 to cook?

447
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,500
 Because I reckon if it is, it probably is still there.

448
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:52,200
 I'll have the dog face, please.

449
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,100
 To be fair, it is possible that maybe a dog was looking through the other side of the

450
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,100
 tank.

451
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,060
 Was it a fellow diner's pet?

452
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:03,060
 You can see fish that have human looking teeth as well.

453
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,060
 What's it called?

454
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,060
 The Paku?

455
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,060
 Paku.

456
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,060
 You mean as well as the one that Anne's mentioned.

457
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,060
 Oh, is that the Paku one?

458
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,060
 Mine's a sheep's head fish.

459
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,060
 It's called Sheep's Head, but that might be their official name.

460
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:14,920
 There are more fish than you would think with human looking teeth, but the one that scared

461
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,500
 me the most, I didn't know dogs could have teeth on their beaks.

462
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,780
 You see the Goosander dog?

463
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:22,780
 Not only that, he lives in the UK, they're everywhere, and they're terrified of this

464
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,780
 dog.

465
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,860
 That would be a great animated cartoon for Loosanders to do.

466
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:31,180
 You've got the Goosanders, which say, "Shonigan, Joshua Witticombe," and Goosanders.

467
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,620
 Looking up this line up really well.

468
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,900
 I was thinking, "Oh, what did you see in the park?

469
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,900
 Goosander duck?"

470
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,900
 Oh, really?

471
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,900
 Two things.

472
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,180
 Just the one with all the teeth.

473
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:47,540
 The Paku we mentioned a few seconds ago, they supposedly combined human testicles off.

474
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,660
 They're invasive.

475
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:54,860
 I think you get them in Papua New Guinea or somewhere, and they have come into the Northern

476
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:59,100
 Hemisphere more recently, and whenever they catch one, it's always in the news it's like

477
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:03,100
 testicle-biting fish in the Thames or whatever.

478
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,100
 Oh, really?

479
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,100
 I think it's not true.

480
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:12,860
 They're vegetarian, so they eat nuts, and the story goes that someone with particularly

481
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:17,300
 nut-like testicles was standing by the water in Papua New Guinea.

482
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:21,700
 That's the swollen balls that person has got if they've got the consistency of a nut.

483
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,700
 It depends what kind of nut.

484
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,420
 Are there any nuts that are as soft as testicles out there?

485
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:29,860
 No, this does sound like one incident, and it's similar to a man going to a hospital

486
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:35,000
 saying, "I don't know how my penis got inside this vacuum cleaner, but..."

487
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:41,660
 It's an invasive species of Henry Hoover's who supposedly eat penises.

488
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,300
 I think there's a little bit of that.

489
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:47,340
 I think there was one story of some people in Papua New Guinea, and one person possibly

490
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:53,140
 had the genitals bitten by this fish, and it has since kind of...

491
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,180
 But what was he doing with that fish?

492
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,180
 He was urinating by the side of the lake.

493
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,180
 Yeah, right.

494
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:01,300
 There was a scary story about a fish that would swim up your urine stream.

495
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,300
 Was that real?

496
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,300
 No.

497
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,300
 No.

498
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,300
 I feel like they're not.

499
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,300
 Can we just establish it?

500
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,300
 There's a big difference, and I feel like tabloids often do this as well in headlines.

501
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:13,700
 Then you read the text, and James, you may have just done it between bitten and bitten

502
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:19,500
 off, and I think it's much less scary to have something bite your arm than to have it bite

503
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,500
 off your arm, for instance.

504
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,500
 Yeah.

505
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,980
 Same with testicles, I would argue as well.

506
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:23,980
 Yeah, probably it's the same.

507
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:28,100
 I think what I'm saying is that there was a very small little nibble on this man's

508
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,100
 genitals.

509
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,100
 And it has since...

510
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,100
 And it made the national news.

511
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,100
 Yeah.

512
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,100
 It's snowballed into...

513
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,100
 Since...

514
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,500
 Whenever the paku comes to town, everyone's like, "That's the ball eating fish."

515
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:40,140
 The other option is that he was bit on the balls by a human and had to quickly come up

516
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:44,340
 with an excuse for his wife and went, "No, it was the fish that has human teeth."

517
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:47,900
 It's called the sheep's head.

518
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:52,500
 Because someone's human has bitten his balls, he's gone, "No, no, it was a fish."

519
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,780
 And she's like, "Well, you can see the teeth marks."

520
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,780
 They're human.

521
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,780
 They're clearly human teeth.

522
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,780
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

523
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,780
 The paku.

524
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,780
 It's the paku.

525
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,780
 No, I know you're having an affair.

526
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:05,580
 You're having an affair with someone who gives a very bad blow to us.

527
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:09,500
 I was reading about a different type of mouths that fish can have.

528
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,220
 You can have a superior mouth or an inferior mouth.

529
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,220
 Okay.

530
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,220
 What's your criteria?

531
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,220
 That is...

532
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,220
 Can you guess what it is?

533
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,220
 A superior and an inferior.

534
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,220
 One's on top of your head, I suppose?

535
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,220
 On top of your head?

536
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,820
 Well, because if it's superior, I feel like it's on the top.

537
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:25,100
 How many fish have you seen where the mouth is above the eyes?

538
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,100
 Oh, look.

539
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,100
 We've said that...

540
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,700
 I bet there are some fish where the mouth is above the eyes.

541
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,700
 That was an upside-down fish.

542
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,700
 Turn it around.

543
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,740
 It was my dead goldfish.

544
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,740
 Is it?

545
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,180
 You're more or less there in fairness.

546
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:43,380
 A superior mouth is basically imagine a smiling fish and imagine a frowning fish for an inferior

547
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,380
 mouth.

548
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,820
 Oh, so it's like whether it turns up or down.

549
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,820
 Yeah, precisely.

550
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:50,580
 And if you have a superior mouth and you're a smiling fish, then you usually would feed

551
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,580
 on the surface.

552
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,580
 So you might get insects from the surface of the water.

553
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:56,140
 Oh, so you're turning your spoon around to go up or go down.

554
00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:00,380
 And if you're an inferior mouth, you're probably a bottom feeder, as in you're getting stuff

555
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,900
 off the floor.

556
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:05,900
 And they have terminal mouths like goldfish, which is just at the front.

557
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:09,180
 So it's neither a smile nor a frown, and they're usually omnivores.

558
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,540
 They'll eat all sorts of stuff.

559
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,540
 Oh, that's funny.

560
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:14,300
 It's quite interesting that if you look at a fish and you see whether it's smiling or

561
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,780
 frowning, you can tell how it eats.

562
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,900
 Maybe you can't tell their mood.

563
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,900
 No, you can't.

564
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,900
 Because imagine if you're a really grumpy, pessimistic fish, but you've got the superior

565
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,500
 mouth and you're like, "Everyone thinks I'm so jolly.

566
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,500
 I'm having the worst day."

567
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,780
 We've never had anybody talk about gnarls before.

568
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,780
 Oh, yeah.

569
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,780
 And they're a toothed whale.

570
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:34,780
 Count as a toothed whale.

571
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:35,780
 That's one big tooth.

572
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,780
 Yeah.

573
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,780
 It's where they think unicorns.

574
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,140
 The idea for unicorns came from.

575
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:43,060
 They found these narwhal tusks and they were like, "Wow, this must be from a horse."

576
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,060
 Okay, right.

577
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,980
 But not only is it one big tooth, it's their only tooth.

578
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,020
 And it's actually their left tooth.

579
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:53,300
 It's their left canine.

580
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:56,900
 So they all have a right canine that doesn't erupt in their mouth.

581
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:00,080
 In fact, occasionally you'll see an arwhal where its right one is erupted and it's got

582
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,580
 a double horn thing going on.

583
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,580
 Yeah, right on.

584
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,580
 That's cool.

585
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,300
 So do the males have really long ones?

586
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,180
 Yeah, females tend not to have them actually.

587
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,180
 Really?

588
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,180
 At all.

589
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:13,240
 And what's the, do we know what sort of like the evolutionary reason for them retaining

590
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,240
 just one?

591
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,280
 I think if males have them, it feels like it's sexual selection.

592
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,280
 It does.

593
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,320
 But again, bizarrely, given they're quite prominent, we really don't know.

594
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,700
 And they've looked at lots of things.

595
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:27,340
 They thought maybe they use it as an ice pick or as a tool for echolocation and...

596
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:31,740
 Or sort of like a cocktail steak for, you know, how you put sausages and pineapples on and

597
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,740
 cheese and so on.

598
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:36,060
 And then only for catering, because if it was on your tooth, you couldn't get it in

599
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,060
 your mouth.

600
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,060
 That's true.

601
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,900
 But you'd not bring it to the mate that you're trying to...

602
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,100
 Oh yeah, like what I've got for you.

603
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:46,980
 Do you think that's sexy, Dan, if your partner has a really long tooth and you attach some

604
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,940
 pineapple and cheese on and feed it directly into your mouth?

605
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,000
 Is that what, what does it for you?

606
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 That is right.

607
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,500
 You know she's got that.

608
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:59,920
 You've not signed up to my only friend, so I thought you, is that the biggest tooth in

609
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,920
 nature?

610
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,620
 Oh, it is big.

611
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,620
 How long can they get to?

612
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,740
 I feel like they can get to a couple of metres, can't they?

613
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,820
 I think, yeah, I reckon it must be.

614
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,540
 It's about half their body length.

615
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,100
 Yeah, 'cause tusks are not teeth.

616
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,380
 Tusks are catering, catering, no.

617
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,380
 Caratine?

618
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:15,380
 Caratine.

619
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,380
 Caratine.

620
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:20,180
 You're gonna have a word with my drug dealer.

621
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:23,340
 It's doing nothing for me.

622
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,340
 My hair looks amazing.

623
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,700
 I'm being accused of poaching.

624
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,300
 What's going on, mate?

625
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:34,640
 The only thing, other thing could be possibly like other large whales that have got teeth,

626
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,840
 but I reckon that would be the biggest.

627
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,080
 Yeah, it's gotta be up there, yeah.

628
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:44,220
 Just on the subject of fish teeth, I came across, actually a while ago, and I've been

629
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:48,920
 looking for a chance to mention it, an old Russian folktale of a beautiful young woman

630
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:52,920
 who's married to a really disgusting man that she hates.

631
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:56,760
 Sounds like my marriage.

632
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:01,940
 Tell me how long that continues to be true in this story.

633
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:08,340
 To put him off having sex with her, she puts a fish head into her vagina so that every

634
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,780
 time he's up for it, he's like, "Oh, what are all these teeth?"

635
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,940
 I guess it's one of these goldfish with the teeth heads.

636
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:14,940
 That's the paku.

637
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:21,140
 It's a paku head, it's specifies, and then she says, "What, you idiot, all women have

638
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,140
 this.

639
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,140
 You don't want to do it.

640
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,140
 You don't want to do it."

641
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:27,420
 That's what she's doing, and so he never gets to have sex with her.

642
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,420
 Oh, wow.

643
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,420
 That's a shame.

644
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,580
 It's a really sad story for him.

645
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,580
 It is, really.

646
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,580
 And for her, he's got a fish.

647
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,580
 Yeah.

648
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,080
 In places where you shouldn't have fish.

649
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,100
 She's kind of a bit worse off, yeah.

650
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:42,380
 If she'd have put a soccer mouth catfish up her belly, it might have been better, because

651
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,700
 they have bendy teeth.

652
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,700
 Oh, okay.

653
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:49,180
 The first fish that we found that have got bendy teeth, because they scrape stuff off

654
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:54,780
 rocks, and if they had hard, non-bendy teeth, then they might fall off, or they might break

655
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,780
 or whatever.

656
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:56,780
 That's cool.

657
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:59,580
 And they reckon that probably more fish have them as well, but we've never found them before.

658
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,500
 So that might be quite nice, some bendy teeth.

659
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,500
 Yeah.

660
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,840
 Oh, she'd be so annoyed if she got that one fish.

661
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,660
 She's like, "Oh, I'm into this."

662
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:10,740
 That's, vagina dentata is common in folklore, isn't it?

663
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:15,620
 And is it, who's the god in Moana?

664
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,620
 It's Maui.

665
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,620
 Maui.

666
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,620
 Yeah.

667
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,500
 Is it written by some vagina or something?

668
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:25,540
 Yeah, I think that's not featuring the live-action Moana remake of Disney I'm currently working

669
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,540
 on.

670
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:35,540
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

671
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:40,700
 My fact this week is that a book club in America has finally finished reading Finnegan's Wake

672
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,620
 after 28 years of monthly meet-ups.

673
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,180
 28 years.

674
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,180
 28 years.

675
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,180
 Impressive.

676
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,180
 It's incredible.

677
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:54,460
 In 1995, there was between 10 and 30 people who would show up to these monthly book clubs,

678
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:58,900
 and Finnegan's Wake is a very complicated, unreadable book.

679
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:02,700
 They decided, rather than getting through the whole thing and doing it in one book club,

680
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,920
 they would take it two pages at a time.

681
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:09,620
 That proved to be, I think, a bit too much, so they then brought it down to one page per

682
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,540
 book club, and they've been doing this.

683
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:14,660
 They did it, you know, through the pandemic, they've been doing it over Zoom, they keep

684
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:20,580
 meeting up, and yeah, they finally just got to the end, but it's being reported as the

685
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:26,060
 end, but as the man who runs the book club, a guy called Jerry, pointed out, it ends on

686
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:30,540
 a sentence that is a continuous loop sentence, which means you come right back to the beginning

687
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,540
 of the book.

688
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,540
 No.

689
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,100
 So they're just starting from page one again now.

690
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,100
 What a horrible realisation.

691
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,540
 That must have been in the last session.

692
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,540
 The last day.

693
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,540
 Punch and pain.

694
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,540
 Thank God.

695
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:42,540
 I never have to see these awful people again.

696
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,540
 That's amazing.

697
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,540
 But it's amazing.

698
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:47,580
 Like, the people who've been in and out of this group, one guy dropped out of the group

699
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:50,740
 for 20 years and came back, you know, they were still waiting.

700
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,420
 They must have been quite lost, but then I suppose everyone is.

701
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:55,540
 I think they got through 15 chapters in that time, yeah.

702
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,620
 Yeah, that's the whole point of it, isn't it?

703
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:00,020
 It's a completely impenetrable book.

704
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:03,740
 Even people that you would consider to be those who love literature and would, like,

705
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:09,380
 be snooty and say, "No, it's actually a masterpiece," all just say, "It's just lots of words."

706
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:12,620
 No one can agree, like, who the main characters are, what the plot is.

707
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,980
 Have you dipped into it?

708
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:14,980
 No.

709
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:15,980
 Finnegan's way.

710
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:16,980
 No of all-choice stuff.

711
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:17,980
 I don't know if Anna has.

712
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:18,980
 No.

713
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:23,260
 Yeah, I think it's amazing that even after all this time, they've read it for 28 years,

714
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:26,340
 they won't be able to say what happened, because no one knows what happened.

715
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,340
 No one knows.

716
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,740
 It's just, that's so amazing, isn't it?

717
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,740
 It's mad.

718
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:32,620
 It's almost like an endurance sport rather than a hobby now, isn't it?

719
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,620
 Like, 28 years.

720
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,620
 But this is the thing.

721
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,820
 They're not, like, alone in being a book club that has done this.

722
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,780
 They just happen to have possibly gone the longest.

723
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:41,460
 There's a guy called Sam Slote, who's a historian.

724
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,700
 He's an expert at Trinity College Dublin on Joyce.

725
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,860
 That's what he looks into.

726
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:49,820
 And yeah, he was reading the book for 15 years.

727
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:53,300
 You know, there was other groups that, they all go into, like, just over 10 years.

728
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,260
 But this is the longest one so far.

729
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:58,300
 Think of all the books you've missed out on in that time that actually make sense.

730
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,620
 Yeah, that's true.

731
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,740
 You can't read all the books in your lifetime.

732
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,740
 Yeah.

733
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,820
 You might as well stick with one's The Hungry Caterpillar.

734
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,820
 Absolute banger.

735
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:06,820
 Yeah, absolutely.

736
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,820
 I just get through that many times in one meeting.

737
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,300
 I think this is what Joyce wanted.

738
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:14,580
 I think he wanted people to dedicate their lives to reading just him, to analyzing him.

739
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,020
 That's quite a big move, isn't it?

740
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:18,340
 Like, no, you'll be my book, not only my book.

741
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,340
 Yeah.

742
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,340
 Yeah, it is.

743
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,940
 It's a statement about what you think of yourself.

744
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,940
 Well, he's kind of done it with certain people.

745
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:24,940
 Yeah.

746
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:25,940
 Yeah.

747
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:28,940
 You know, your fact, sorry, I meant to say, Dan, is wrong.

748
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:29,940
 Yeah, I know.

749
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:30,940
 It's a spelling mistake.

750
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,940
 A spelling bit of a spelling mistake, yeah.

751
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:33,940
 Oh.

752
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:34,940
 Well, technically.

753
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:35,940
 Oh, I see.

754
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:36,940
 Yeah, yeah.

755
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:37,940
 There were punctuation errors, wasn't it?

756
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:38,940
 Yeah.

757
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:39,940
 Okay.

758
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:40,940
 It's an apostrophe, yes.

759
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:41,940
 An apostrophe.

760
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,740
 I'd actually never noticed this until I went to the Wikipedia page.

761
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,660
 There's no apostrophe in it.

762
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:49,500
 So it's not the wake of Finnegan.

763
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,380
 It's Finnegan's plural.

764
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,380
 Wake.

765
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,380
 It's like Finnegan's comma.

766
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,620
 Wake, exclamation mark.

767
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:59,180
 And there's a character called Finnegan in it.

768
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,580
 And I believe he's being resurrected.

769
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,740
 So it's like he's waking up.

770
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,740
 So shouldn't he be the main character?

771
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:06,460
 I haven't read it either, but I would assume if it's called Finnegan's Wake and you've

772
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,460
 got a Finnegan.

773
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:10,380
 Well, there are quite a few Finnegan's as well.

774
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,380
 Oh, really?

775
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:14,540
 I thought the Finnegan's was just referring to, was like pluralised to be confusing and

776
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:17,260
 refer to like Irish people generally, but are there multiple Finnegan's in the book?

777
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,500
 Well, there are multiple Finnegan's.

778
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:24,820
 I think the collective Irish group being called Finnegan's is the most common explanation

779
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,180
 for the lack of apostrophe.

780
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,180
 Right.

781
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:31,660
 Some people think it's so that the word wake can mean the awakening and also the wake has

782
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:35,780
 enough to someone die, so it gives you a nice little bit of uncertainness there.

783
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:39,180
 Some people think it was a fuck up by Samuel Beckett, who wrote...

784
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:40,180
 Wait, sorry?

785
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,180
 Samuel Beckett?

786
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,180
 So...

787
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,180
 Well, it's his proofreader.

788
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,180
 No.

789
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,180
 Well, Joyce kind of...

790
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:47,300
 But what do you call it when someone speaks it to you?

791
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,300
 Dictators.

792
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,300
 Yeah.

793
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,300
 Beckett dictated it.

794
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,300
 Really?

795
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,300
 Yeah.

796
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,300
 Or certainly some of it.

797
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,300
 Are you mixing transcribing and dictating?

798
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,300
 Oh, perhaps.

799
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,300
 What's the difference?

800
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,300
 You would dictate...

801
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,800
 Can you dictate to someone and then they transcribe what you're saying?

802
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,800
 Oh, I see.

803
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,800
 Yes.

804
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,800
 I think Joyce is...

805
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,800
 Joyce was dictating.

806
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,800
 Beckett was transcribing.

807
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,800
 Excellent point.

808
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,800
 Maybe.

809
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,800
 Just maybe five minutes in the edit.

810
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,800
 Maybe they weren't there.

811
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,800
 Maybe it was always the other way around and Beckett wrote it.

812
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,280
 I was like, "Don't put my name on that.

813
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,040
 I don't want to be cursed."

814
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:17,540
 Famous story where Beckett is dictating and there's a knock on the door and James Joyce

815
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,780
 says, "Come in."

816
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:21,620
 And Beckett just writes, "Come in in the middle of the story."

817
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,620
 Oh, really?

818
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:28,940
 So that was from a biography of Joyce, which where he interviewed Beckett and Beckett said

819
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:29,980
 this happened.

820
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:34,460
 But if you look in the text and just control F, you don't have to read the whole thing.

821
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:38,480
 But if you look in the text and look for the phrase, "Come in," there is no place where

822
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,160
 it's just like an interjection where it doesn't belong.

823
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:46,600
 So either Beckett made it up or maybe it actually happened and then later on he thought, "You

824
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,600
 know what?

825
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,600
 That was stupid.

826
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,600
 I'm going to take that out."

827
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,600
 Right.

828
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,600
 I'm not sure what happened.

829
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,600
 Or an editor was like...

830
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,760
 I don't think there was much of an editor because there was loads of typos in all of Joyce's

831
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,760
 work, wasn't there?

832
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:00,440
 That's something that's really interesting because I was reading an article where they're

833
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:05,740
 saying that basically the way you can read Joyce now, people have been trying to make

834
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:09,300
 sense of this book so much that they've employed different ways of cleaning it up in order

835
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,300
 to make sense of it.

836
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:13,820
 So there's a version out there where people have taken all the typos out so it kind of

837
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:17,060
 reads a bit more smoother and you're not going, "What the hell is this word?"

838
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:21,340
 There's a digital version now where basically everything is hyperlinked.

839
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:25,260
 Therefore you can get an understanding of everything and you find yourself using it

840
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,540
 as a repository of all knowledge.

841
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:31,160
 It's basically a weird encyclopedia where you just go, "Oh cool, I'm now learning about

842
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,160
 this random thing by clicking on it."

843
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,400
 So they keep trying to turn it into something useful.

844
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,400
 But it's not.

845
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,400
 But it's not.

846
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,800
 Ultimately it's just not in its own thing.

847
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:44,360
 The words that he made up in it, there's a hundred letter long word on the first page

848
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:49,680
 which is the sound of a thunderclap that was heard at the fall of the Garden of Eden.

849
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,360
 Are you going to give us the words?

850
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,160
 Yeah, I want to hear the words.

851
00:36:53,160 --> 00:37:08,820
 [Singing]

852
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,820
 That's close but not quite.

853
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:10,820
 That was pretty good.

854
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:11,820
 That's good.

855
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:12,820
 I felt like there was a storm outside.

856
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:15,980
 I would argue that Boom does the same job.

857
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:19,020
 That would have been your first thing as an editor.

858
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,020
 Right.

859
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,020
 Boom.

860
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,020
 Opening words.

861
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:26,560
 Life would be more difficult for the Vengerbuys if no one had invented the word Boom and

862
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,560
 they had to do this four times.

863
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,280
 Much less catchy.

864
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,880
 It was reused by Sylvia Plath in the Belcha, that word.

865
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,880
 That word, right?

866
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,880
 Can I see it written down?

867
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,880
 Yeah, it's there.

868
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,880
 Are you thinking about using that in your next children's book account?

869
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,880
 It's in the title.

870
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:44,320
 It depends if you're on a word count for being paid a number of words or whether you're paid

871
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,680
 a number of letters.

872
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:50,600
 Useful words as well that he made up, which we've already mentioned before, but quark.

873
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,600
 Quark is from Finnegan's Wake.

874
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,600
 Yes.

875
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,600
 The scientific word it's from.

876
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:59,260
 There's a line in it that goes three quarks for muster mark and then quarks can cluster

877
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:01,660
 together in threes to form other.

878
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,020
 So that's where...

879
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:08,320
 I think Murray Gellman wanted to call them quarks and he always had this idea of they're

880
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:15,260
 called quarks and then he saw the word quark in Finnegan's Wake where it clearly rhymes

881
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:19,700
 with mark, but even though he spelt it in the same way that Joyce did, he always pronounced

882
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,700
 it quark.

883
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,680
 Do you think he really tediously corrected people whenever they refer to it?

884
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:28,000
 It's really interesting because I always call them quarks having studied physics and I

885
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,620
 think 75% of physicists say quark rather than quark.

886
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:35,480
 I can't believe as many as 25% are doing the pretentious.

887
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,480
 This is what he wanted.

888
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,480
 Quark pronunciation.

889
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,480
 Come on, physicists.

890
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,680
 This is very like the laser loser.

891
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:44,400
 So laser is an acronym, in fact, light, I forgot what it is.

892
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,400
 Light amplified.

893
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,400
 Yeah.

894
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,400
 And then someone's like actually the light's oscillating, so they should be called losers.

895
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,460
 I never heard that.

896
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,860
 Oh, that's great.

897
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:57,300
 Joyce was particularly upset about World War II, wasn't he?

898
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:02,380
 I know none of us liked it, but it was a real bugbear for him because it interrupted the

899
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:05,580
 publication of his book or he was worried it would get in the way.

900
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:10,860
 So as discussed, he spent 17 years writing it, which is not that long when you consider

901
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:16,340
 how long it takes to read, but he was realizing he was sort of getting close to the end in

902
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:20,960
 about 1936 and he was getting really stressed out about global conditions.

903
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,660
 At one point he complained to a friend, "Look, the fact that the world is in such a bad state

904
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:28,440
 at the moment is really stressful for me because I find it so hard to write being so anxious

905
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,940
 about it."

906
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:34,280
 And then when he handed in the manuscript in 1939, he said, "Please hurry publishing

907
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,880
 it because war's going to break out and then no one will read my book anymore."

908
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,880
 That is amazing.

909
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,880
 That's not why.

910
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:45,740
 The thing is, if you're going to spend how long, 17, 18 years writing it, the chance

911
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:49,160
 of you, it would have to be in the high end period of peace, wouldn't it?

912
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:53,560
 There's no other time when you're not going to run into some war or other.

913
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,560
 You're right.

914
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:59,520
 So I was looking at what the longest book to read by pages rather than complexity.

915
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,520
 Oh yeah.

916
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:04,960
 So the longest novel in the Penguin classics and modern classics is In Search of Lost Time

917
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,960
 by Marcel Proust.

918
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,960
 Yeah.

919
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,040
 It is six volumes, 3,616 pages.

920
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,280
 So in the time it would take you to read it, you could fly from London to Auckland and

921
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,280
 back again and then to Barbados.

922
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:20,140
 But only if you have to not take any breaks and to read one page a minute for that entire

923
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,140
 time.

924
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,140
 One page a minute.

925
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,140
 Yeah.

926
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:25,420
 I bought a copy of that thinking I would read it and it was absolutely massive.

927
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:28,740
 And I started and then I realized that I only had the first volume.

928
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:33,740
 If this is the first volume, there is no way in the world I'm going to read this.

929
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:36,620
 Years ago I thought I'd read Oliver Twist and I said to someone, "Oh, I've just finished

930
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,620
 Oliver Twist."

931
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,780
 And they said, "Oh, did you like the bit about Dodger's Trial?"

932
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:40,780
 And I said, "What trial?"

933
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:45,300
 And I'd had the bridge version and I didn't realize I really missed out on it.

934
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:50,440
 You read the transcript of the musical theatre version, Oliver exclamation mark.

935
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,820
 I love the songs, yeah.

936
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:57,440
 You read as part of fish research or you started reading Curious If You Finish, Les Mis.

937
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,580
 God, I started reading so many things as part of this research.

938
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:03,940
 In fact, I started reading The Woman in White a few weeks ago and still haven't got to the

939
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:04,940
 end of that.

940
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:07,640
 But yeah, Les Mis, I got most of the way through it but I didn't finish it.

941
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:12,100
 Well, I read Les Mis's 365 chapters, so you can read one a day, which is quite neat.

942
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:15,300
 But not at a leap year or you can have a day off.

943
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,300
 Interesting.

944
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:20,460
 James, have you ever thought about reading fiction for pleasure rather than for the podcast?

945
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,100
 I think you might get to the end of more books.

946
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,100
 I really struggle.

947
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:26,860
 I've got to say, I really struggle to read fiction for pleasure these days.

948
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:27,860
 Really?

949
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,860
 Yeah.

950
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:32,360
 Because I read so much non-fiction for my job, I need like a year off.

951
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:36,540
 What you need is a book club because I started doing a book club and it does force you to

952
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:37,540
 read.

953
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:41,180
 Yeah, and it forces you to read things that you might not have new books that have come

954
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,180
 out that people have been interested in.

955
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:46,100
 Is that the idea of fiction that you're forced to read stuff and that's why you do it?

956
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,760
 Just it carves out the time for you to do it, which is interesting.

957
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,760
 Accountability.

958
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,760
 Yeah.

959
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,760
 Aren't you in the same book club as Andy though?

960
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,760
 I think I've heard about someone from the book.

961
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,760
 Yeah.

962
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,760
 Is it just Andy's book every week?

963
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,760
 It is.

964
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,760
 Yeah.

965
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,760
 It does feel like a post-apocalyptic world.

966
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,760
 I'm living it every time we chat about it.

967
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,720
 What was your best book you discovered through book club?

968
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:05,600
 Silly Plants of the Bell Jar, which I love her poetry and I've never read the book itself.

969
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,600
 I've never read the book.

970
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,600
 Did you remember this?

971
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,600
 Yeah.

972
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,740
 Because I haven't read that book and so I was going off Wikipedia that this word was

973
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:11,740
 in it.

974
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:12,740
 I think it is true, right?

975
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:16,300
 Weirdly, I don't remember the word, but you know, you don't remember every detail, right?

976
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,260
 Well, you might remember a hundred-letter word.

977
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,900
 I assumed it was a typo.

978
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:22,900
 Well, no, but you know, also when you're on a deadline for book club, it's like, "Fantastic.

979
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:26,180
 What a great word to zoom in on.

980
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,180
 It's like the fast lane.

981
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,180
 It's like a travelator."

982
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,180
 They are good.

983
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,940
 Aren't you in a book club?

984
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:37,160
 No, I'm not, but I think what I would like to be in one for is that discovering books

985
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,160
 that you might not know about.

986
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,960
 So I've got some friends who are just so, so good at book recommendations and really

987
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,280
 good at personalizing it to what you like to read.

988
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:48,320
 So I read an article years ago saying that actually there's an argument that you shouldn't

989
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:52,880
 read books that win prizes and the argument being that if you say you're not into Russian

990
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,440
 high society and agriculture, why would you suddenly be so just because it won a prize?

991
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,920
 So actually, it can put you off books, which actually if you go in and say-

992
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,920
 You're driving war on peace there.

993
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:02,920
 Sorry.

994
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:07,500
 But what if you aren't into agriculture, aren't into Russian high society but are into people

995
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,500
 being hit by trains?

996
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,500
 What do you-

997
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:13,140
 Well, then I reckon there's somewhere a book shop with that's the category.

998
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:16,700
 I hear Andy's podcast at qi.com/emailpinging.

999
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:21,420
 How dare you spoil it, Andy?

1000
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:25,420
 Well, that's good that we're bucking and trying to bit you being in a book club, Dan.

1001
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:26,860
 And I, in fact, am in a book club.

1002
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:27,860
 And I'm not.

1003
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:28,860
 It's extraordinary.

1004
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:33,320
 I know we know that it's mostly women, but it's 88% of book clubs in America at least

1005
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,120
 are all women.

1006
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:40,520
 And women generally read quite a lot more fiction than men.

1007
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,720
 And book clubs are so popular these days as well.

1008
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,360
 I think since Oprah Winfrey's book club, they've shot up.

1009
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:50,000
 I think there was a survey of women who read at least one book a month that found over half

1010
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,240
 of them were in book clubs, which makes sense because when you're reading that often, that's

1011
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,240
 why.

1012
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,240
 Well, here's a really interesting thing.

1013
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:59,980
 I went to a publishing party not too long ago, and there was an author there who I'd

1014
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:02,100
 met whose book came out at the same time as mine.

1015
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,100
 She had an American release.

1016
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:06,860
 It was a fiction novel called Wayward's Brilliant.

1017
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:09,740
 And she was the New York Times bestseller.

1018
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:12,620
 And she's an Australian who moved over here.

1019
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:13,820
 It's her first debut book.

1020
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:14,820
 I said, "How?

1021
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:15,820
 How?

1022
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:16,820
 You weren't even in America.

1023
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,820
 How did that happen?"

1024
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:18,820
 Book clubs.

1025
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:22,460
 She said, "Publishers desperately try and put their books in positions to get them into

1026
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:23,460
 book clubs."

1027
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:26,880
 And she said, "You sell like 30 a time."

1028
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:27,880
 They're just massive.

1029
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:28,880
 How do you...

1030
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,920
 What you go around like asking people, "Are you in a book club?"

1031
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:35,320
 So you give away a lot of free books and stuff online as e-books, and then it gets a reputation

1032
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:39,320
 and then book clubs pick it up and Reese Witherspoon is the other massive book club in America.

1033
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,320
 They're also...

1034
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,320
 Do you mean big famous book clubs?

1035
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,320
 Yeah, yeah.

1036
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,320
 Sorry, you don't mean just like my book club.

1037
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,320
 No, no.

1038
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,320
 People will not buy my books.

1039
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,320
 But probably them as well.

1040
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,320
 Yeah.

1041
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,320
 Probably them as well, yeah.

1042
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,320
 Just books that are heavily marketed or promoted.

1043
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,960
 Do you know where the biggest book club in the world is?

1044
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:51,960
 The biggest in the world.

1045
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:52,960
 Okay.

1046
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:53,960
 Yeah, right.

1047
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:54,960
 Contender.

1048
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,120
 I'm going to say Iceland, because they're famously, they all write books and read novels.

1049
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,120
 Oh, yes.

1050
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,600
 I feel like you've checked all the book club accounts, but I'm going with volume.

1051
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,120
 I'm going with the digital world.

1052
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,120
 Booktalk.

1053
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:06,240
 So this is the book club version of TikTok.

1054
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,240
 Oh, okay.

1055
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:10,720
 So they believe that Booktalk has sold 20 million books in 2021.

1056
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:11,720
 Wow.

1057
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:12,720
 It's huge.

1058
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:13,720
 There's this huge number of books now.

1059
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:14,720
 Colin Hooper, right?

1060
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,040
 Yeah, and they'll say like, "TikTok made me buy it."

1061
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,560
 And it's like these books that just really drive through TikTok.

1062
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,920
 So much so that they've launched the TikTok Book Awards this year.

1063
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:26,000
 And what I love about this is because TikTok, I guess, is so many people, they're not just

1064
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,880
 books that came out this year that were popular in one shop or by one sort of person.

1065
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,880
 So they gave them a word to Jane Austen.

1066
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,880
 She got revival.

1067
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:32,880
 Yeah.

1068
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,440
 So it's like really new stuff, really old stuff.

1069
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:39,280
 Can I ask, yeah, sorry, for like older listeners, not myself, obviously, but for other people

1070
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:43,640
 who might not really know what TikTok is, can you explain how that works?

1071
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,880
 It's not just one book club where everyone reads the same thing.

1072
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:46,880
 No.

1073
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,240
 So TikTok is video sharing and I'm guessing everybody who uses the hashtag Booktalk and

1074
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,400
 can see what they're talking about.

1075
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:55,120
 So things sort of trend and build and you sort of find, and I guess what's nice about

1076
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:57,920
 it is if you read a book that you love it and no one else has, you can find someone

1077
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,920
 who's made a video and see what they say about it.

1078
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,880
 Whereas if I've read one book and no one else I know has read it.

1079
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,640
 And to be fair, sometimes I finish a book and I'll go onto Goodreads just to see what

1080
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,360
 people have said and see if I agree with them.

1081
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,360
 Oh yeah, have you seen it?

1082
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:09,360
 Yeah.

1083
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,360
 Definitely.

1084
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,000
 But she has a good like twisty end and I'm like, did I understand that?

1085
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
 Definitely.

1086
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
 What actually happened?

1087
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
 I'll go and check.

1088
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,320
 I have a mental reasoning question for you.

1089
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:18,320
 Really?

1090
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,320
 Love these.

1091
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,320
 Love this book club.

1092
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,320
 Yeah.

1093
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:27,480
 So it was founded in 1996 and the idea was that it would be quite highbrow literary options

1094
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,480
 that she chose.

1095
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:33,760
 So she had great books in there like William Faulkner, Toni Morrison, Kulman McCarthy.

1096
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:39,280
 So really good books over the years and every time she makes a choice it pretty much becomes

1097
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,280
 a bestseller.

1098
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,280
 Yeah.

1099
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,360
 It's like rockets to the top of the charts.

1100
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,360
 Yeah.

1101
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,360
 It doesn't exist anymore.

1102
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:47,000
 I think it stopped in about 2010 or something.

1103
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
 Okay.

1104
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,880
 So whenever she chose a book, book sales actually after that decreased.

1105
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:53,880
 Why?

1106
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,800
 Do you mean book sales more generally?

1107
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,080
 General book sales decreased.

1108
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,080
 Okay.

1109
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,080
 This is why.

1110
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,080
 Everyone wants you to buy this one particular book.

1111
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:05,480
 It went out of print really quickly and no one bought anything else because they were

1112
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,400
 waiting for that one to come back into print.

1113
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,400
 Interesting.

1114
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,400
 Interesting.

1115
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:10,400
 Not correct.

1116
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,400
 Good guess though.

1117
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,400
 Paper shortage.

1118
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,000
 It used up so many trees that.

1119
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,800
 Half of the Amazon Oprah is responsible for destroying actually.

1120
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:18,800
 Yeah.

1121
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:23,840
 No, it's specifically about the fact that she chose quite highbrow options but appealed

1122
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:28,200
 to an audience that wouldn't necessarily be reading things like that all the time.

1123
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,200
 Okay.

1124
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,200
 So you're.

1125
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,200
 They spent more time reading.

1126
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,200
 She got it.

1127
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,200
 Oh.

1128
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,640
 So rather than buying two books you buy one and read it for two weeks.

1129
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:36,640
 Exactly.

1130
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:41,080
 These people who are buying three books a week and pacing through them, they're suddenly reading

1131
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,080
 the Sound and the Fury.

1132
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,080
 Oh, that's fine.

1133
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:44,080
 Spending a few weeks.

1134
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:48,520
 So really everyone should be buying much shorter books and getting through more of them.

1135
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,520
 How long's your book though?

1136
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:51,520
 345 pages.

1137
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,040
 That's a very big font.

1138
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:59,400
 My mind's a children's book so it's a bit short.

1139
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:06,760
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is James.

1140
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:11,520
 Okay, my fact this week is that the liquid in a can of beans is more likely to make you

1141
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,640
 farter than the beans themselves.

1142
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,640
 Okay.

1143
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,040
 Good to know.

1144
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:17,040
 Incredible.

1145
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,040
 Useful.

1146
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,040
 Useful knowledge.

1147
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,040
 Yeah.

1148
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,040
 Is it?

1149
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,040
 Are you going to start rinsing all over your mouth?

1150
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:28,560
 No, I'm going to start chugging bean juice because I just want to be more farty.

1151
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:32,840
 So this comes from an article on the website Serious Eats and they partnered with Harvard

1152
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:37,920
 Science of Cucking Program and looked at the fartiness of various beans and stuff like

1153
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:43,840
 that and to see if there were any ways to decrease the effect and they looked at various

1154
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:48,120
 old wives tales of how you do this like you soak your beans for ages.

1155
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,720
 This would not be a can of beans for instance.

1156
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:53,600
 You might soak your beans for ages and then cook them in a certain way and see if that

1157
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:54,600
 makes sense.

1158
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:55,600
 I like that there was someone soaking their Heinsbake beans.

1159
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:59,480
 Everyone always soaks beans so yeah, they're not left them overnight.

1160
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:03,400
 They might be cooking them with bay leaves or something like this and nothing really made

1161
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:09,840
 any difference but they looked at tinned beans and they did find actually that rinsed beans

1162
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:15,240
 from a tin are 20% less farty than unrinsed and that the liquid you throw away is 30%

1163
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,440
 fartier than the beans are themselves.

1164
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,440
 Wow.

1165
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:19,440
 And why?

1166
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:26,480
 So it seems like it kind of seeps into the juice and also the beans they kind of disintegrate

1167
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:30,080
 the longer they're in there and the more farty ones are the ones that disintegrate.

1168
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:33,920
 The hard ones that you just kind of go straight through you, they don't disintegrate.

1169
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:34,920
 Right.

1170
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:38,760
 So yeah, the fartiness seems to just get into the juice somehow.

1171
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:39,760
 That's so interesting.

1172
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,960
 I think some things probably work, right?

1173
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:48,440
 Like there are some things that could counteract the fartiness, there's kombu, the Japanese

1174
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:55,840
 seaweed that you get in, like kombu dashi, it's an ingredient of that and that has these

1175
00:49:55,840 --> 00:50:01,000
 enzymes that break down the sugars in beans when you eat them.

1176
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,480
 So the reason that beans make you fart is because you can't digest the stuff in them

1177
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,040
 but the bacteria in your stomach can, right?

1178
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:14,080
 And then the bacteria as it digests it releases these gases and I believe that kombu manages

1179
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:17,640
 to break down those sugars so the bacteria doesn't have as much to eat and fart out.

1180
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:18,640
 Correct.

1181
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,240
 And so if you add this seaweed to everything, that might work.

1182
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,240
 Might do.

1183
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,240
 You better go.

1184
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:27,720
 So actually, you mentioned my book before, I wrote about a guy who tried to stop farts

1185
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:30,120
 from being produced off the back of beans.

1186
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:31,120
 Yeah, he did.

1187
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:36,840
 Yeah, wonderfully, a man called Colin Leakey and Colin Leakey is the son of Mary and Louis

1188
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:41,040
 Leakey who were the great anthropologists who discovered all these hominid skeletons

1189
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,040
 throughout history.

1190
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:46,680
 So he had seen a report of NASA trying to make beans that could be sent into space and

1191
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:50,640
 not produce flatulence, so lose the fart stuff from beans and he thought, yes, that would

1192
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:56,080
 be amazing to do because if you could invent a bean that gave you less farts, you could

1193
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:59,920
 have that in developing countries where they sometimes, you know, Crohn's disease, for

1194
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,760
 example, beans are meant to be avoided.

1195
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:05,280
 So there's a lot of health implications if you have a lot of wind in you.

1196
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,720
 So he thought if I could invent a bean, that could be like a meat replacement and then

1197
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,880
 we could have safe eating that's going on for all these poorer countries.

1198
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:12,880
 Okay.

1199
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:16,280
 So he spent a lifetime doing that and he did invent two beans which are on sale and

1200
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:20,000
 have been sent over which are meat replacements and less flatulence.

1201
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,380
 So he was a scientist who did great things, but my favorite thing is he patented an invention

1202
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:29,280
 called the flatometer, which was a device that slots into your rectum and there's a tube

1203
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,520
 coming out that connects to a balloon on the other end and you tuck the balloon in your

1204
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:37,760
 shirt pocket and you just collect these, these are his real invention.

1205
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,760
 It's bigger, bigger, bigger.

1206
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:40,760
 Kind of like the Viperfish.

1207
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:45,680
 At the end of the day you're like, oh, it's children's party ever.

1208
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,960
 Yeah, the balloon dog you get given.

1209
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:53,320
 So I was reading that they have measured how much volume a fart has and they did it by

1210
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:56,640
 feeding everyone beans and using a rectal catheter to catch the fart.

1211
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,240
 Would you like to guess the mills?

1212
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,840
 How many mills are average fart?

1213
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,200
 It's hard, isn't it?

1214
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:04,440
 Because it's a gas so it spreads out quite a lot so you would think it would be quite

1215
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:05,440
 a high mills.

1216
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:06,440
 Yeah, interesting.

1217
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,440
 572.

1218
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:08,440
 What?

1219
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:13,480
 I was going to say more like 20, you're kind of in the middle, 90, so we could fit in your

1220
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:14,480
 airport hand luggage.

1221
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:15,480
 Not really.

1222
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,520
 I suppose it doesn't count as a liquid, does it, unless you've done a little bit of follow

1223
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,520
 through.

1224
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:26,240
 Well, another useful thing scientists have invented, speaking of following through, a useful thing

1225
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:30,480
 scientists have invented is a machine that listens to your bottom and distinguishes a

1226
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,040
 fart from a shirt.

1227
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,040
 Ah.

1228
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,840
 And I would argue you would know without a machine whether that's happened.

1229
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:42,240
 You do usually know, don't you, but often, but do they tell you before or after?

1230
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:46,280
 It actually tells you when it's happened.

1231
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:49,760
 Is it more for when someone's done it, but you're with them and you say, was that a fart

1232
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:50,760
 or a shirt?

1233
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:51,760
 And they say, no, it's just a fart.

1234
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:56,520
 And then you go, let me get my machine out.

1235
00:52:56,520 --> 00:53:00,040
 Get to the bathroom, you filthy pig.

1236
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:02,840
 It's meant to also detect more than that as well.

1237
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:05,400
 So the idea is that you have this device.

1238
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:12,040
 It's called the, and listen carefully, the Synthetic Human Acoustic Reproduction Testing,

1239
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,040
 another shot.

1240
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,040
 Oh.

1241
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,040
 Yeah.

1242
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:21,760
 And basically it's to give early warning of like colorectal cancers, things like that,

1243
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:25,760
 bowel cancers, because it's thought that you might have changes in your flatulence sounds

1244
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,160
 or in your poo sounds.

1245
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:30,760
 And if it listens, it might then say, oh, your poo sound a bit different these days or

1246
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:31,880
 your fart sound a bit weird.

1247
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:34,600
 Have you thought about getting checked out?

1248
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:39,560
 And so researchers listen to many hundreds of hours of audio of various pooing and farting

1249
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:43,160
 noises, and then tagged them correctly to train the machine.

1250
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:44,160
 Wow.

1251
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:49,640
 And it can now identify whether something's urination, flatulence, solid defecation or

1252
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:52,800
 diarrhea 98% of the time.

1253
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:56,920
 So it's not at the super advanced level yet, I suppose it's still at the stage of distinguishing

1254
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:57,920
 a wee from a poo.

1255
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:58,920
 Yeah.

1256
00:53:58,920 --> 00:53:59,920
 It's not that advanced.

1257
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:04,640
 If you play them, George Osborne's new podcast, it does say it's diarrhea.

1258
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:11,080
 I was just thinking who I could slam if the podcast community wouldn't, wouldn't attack

1259
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:12,080
 us all.

1260
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:13,080
 Yeah.

1261
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:16,920
 Good luck when he's on next week.

1262
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:22,520
 How much do you think the cheapest can of beans you could buy in the UK was in 1996?

1263
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:23,520
 Oh, 1996.

1264
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:24,520
 Yeah.

1265
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:25,520
 Like 4p?

1266
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,520
 19?

1267
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:27,520
 Yeah, a couple of p.

1268
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:28,520
 A couple of p?

1269
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:29,520
 Yeah.

1270
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,520
 The answer is negative 2p.

1271
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:31,520
 Okay, you take them.

1272
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:32,520
 Why?

1273
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,520
 I'll have 2m.

1274
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:37,960
 Did you get like money back for returning the 10 or something?

1275
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:38,960
 No.

1276
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:44,480
 This was just a crazy moment in retail where it was called the bean wars.

1277
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:48,440
 And basically they were just competing and competing to make the price lower, to win

1278
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:49,440
 the competition.

1279
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:53,400
 Then it got to a point where this one place, which is called Supermarkets, and this place

1280
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:56,640
 called Sanders Supermarket basically had a deal whereby...

1281
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,760
 It surprised me enough it doesn't exist anymore.

1282
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:01,600
 I was like, oh, I sold too many beans on that bus.

1283
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:04,320
 But it went so low that they went into the negatives.

1284
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:09,560
 So if the beans were part of a shopping pile that you had, they took the 2p off of your

1285
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:10,560
 final bill.

1286
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:13,520
 If you were just buying the can of beans, they gave you 2p, but you could only do it

1287
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,020
 for one tin.

1288
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:16,020
 That was their thing.

1289
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:20,360
 But there was a point where you were paid to leave a supermarket with the can of beans.

1290
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:24,360
 This is like when you want a sandwich and it's better to get the meal deal than having

1291
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:27,160
 to buy a drink as well and then your sandwich is cheaper.

1292
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:30,400
 It is, but it's very rare that you can just take the drink from the meal deal and they'll

1293
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,520
 pay you for it.

1294
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,600
 The difference that you would have saved, that is unbelievable.

1295
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,720
 Tesco was selling them at 7p.

1296
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:40,920
 Do you think people went around lots of different supermarkets collecting as many 2p's as they

1297
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:41,920
 could?

1298
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,280
 But if it's 2p and 1 tin, it's quite limited.

1299
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:46,760
 So they'd probably lose less money than they would from like huffing the price of like

1300
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:47,760
 ketchup or toilet roll.

1301
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:48,760
 Totally.

1302
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:52,520
 The price of petrol or bus fare to get to the shop is going to be more than 2p.

1303
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:56,160
 So it's false economy to go around the country to all of these shops.

1304
00:55:56,160 --> 00:56:01,320
 But it would feel nice to get your 2p off and get your free beans.

1305
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:05,440
 I'm the kind of person who would just always do that for no particular reason.

1306
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,440
 Don't you need that many beans?

1307
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:09,480
 Just going in with different hats on to get more beans.

1308
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:12,480
 I'm back again.

1309
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:15,760
 I was on the Heinz Factory website because they made beans.

1310
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,600
 And do you know the average number of beans in a Heinz tin?

1311
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:19,600
 Oh, well what size?

1312
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:20,600
 The normal size.

1313
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:21,600
 There are three sizes.

1314
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:22,600
 Wow, three.

1315
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:24,200
 Oh yeah, you've got those mini ones.

1316
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:27,640
 You've got the mini one, the full one, just like 200, 400, and then you've got the snack

1317
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:28,640
 pot.

1318
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:29,640
 Oh, you're so right.

1319
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:30,640
 Yeah, sorry.

1320
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:31,640
 I mean, the normal one.

1321
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:34,640
 Showing you too much why I eat for lunch.

1322
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:39,160
 And Ann mixes it up every day with a different one.

1323
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:45,600
 Yeah, I'm going to mix it up and have two small pots instead of one big pot.

1324
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:46,600
 Five hundred and seventy-two.

1325
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:47,600
 That's a good guess.

1326
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:50,360
 We switch sides in the reals, Alice.

1327
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:51,360
 The 400s.

1328
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:52,360
 The one everyone knows.

1329
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:59,760
 The mainstream one, not your edgy left field, trendy one.

1330
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,600
 He's so hipster these days, Ann.

1331
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:03,720
 Okay, standard size of beans.

1332
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:08,160
 I can't believe you now don't know the answer, given your knowledge.

1333
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,280
 You've bought so much time.

1334
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:12,480
 James, how many did you say?

1335
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,080
 Five hundred and seventy-two.

1336
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:18,760
 Okay, I'm going to go, I feel so invested in this now, I'm going to go four hundred and

1337
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:19,760
 twenty-four.

1338
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:20,760
 Nice.

1339
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:21,760
 Okay, then, three hundred and sixty-five.

1340
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:25,920
 And you have one, so it's worth something such as what?

1341
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,880
 I like Dan's idea of three hundred and sixty-five.

1342
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:35,720
 It's like every day I'll have one read and read one chapter of Les Miserables.

1343
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:37,880
 It's four hundred and sixty-five on average.

1344
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:43,560
 But the reason I say that is because in twenty-nineteen, a counsellor, Steve Smith, in a break

1345
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:49,560
 from cheating at Cricket, got back.

1346
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:54,600
 I do think it's a different guy, probably, he got back from a residence meeting late

1347
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:59,160
 at night, so I'll crack into a can of high-inspired beans and it was full of sauce and contained

1348
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:00,160
 one bean.

1349
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,920
 I don't remember that.

1350
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:03,920
 How crazy that I remember that.

1351
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:04,920
 Do you remember the story?

1352
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,920
 I don't remember that story coming up.

1353
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:09,360
 Imagine how farty he would have been the next day.

1354
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:10,360
 I know.

1355
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:13,640
 Hungry and farty, it's the worst combo.

1356
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:18,960
 Very randomly, I was in an office the other day, and in through the door came Greg Wallace,

1357
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,640
 who's in MasterChef, that guy.

1358
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:22,640
 That's weird.

1359
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:26,160
 Yeah, there was no connection between us two being there.

1360
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:29,840
 He came and just walked up to me and said, "Wanna hear a bean fact?"

1361
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,380
 And I was like, "Okay, yeah, sure."

1362
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:34,600
 I went, "Oh, I must listen to fish."

1363
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:39,680
 So at the bean factories, they have a laser which tests out good beans, and if they don't

1364
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:44,800
 like it, they flick the bean off, so they have a bean flicker at the thing, and I was

1365
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,840
 like, "Oh, great, that's so cool.

1366
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:51,400
 We could use that on fish or QI," and he went, "Are you connected to that?"

1367
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:56,080
 I would have assumed this guy's really into food facts, you know, and he just tells anyone.

1368
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:58,840
 He literally opened the door, looked me in the face, walked up to me and said, "Do you

1369
00:58:58,840 --> 00:58:59,840
 want to hear a bean fact?"

1370
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:02,240
 Of course, I could have assumed he does.

1371
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:04,560
 Yeah, I genuinely would never have assumed that.

1372
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:06,120
 Did people just come up to you randomly?

1373
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:09,160
 If it's Greg Wallace, I would have thought, he knows he's famous, he's like, "I get a

1374
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:10,660
 way with doing this to a randomer."

1375
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:13,320
 I can't believe that I'm coming across as the weird one at this time.

1376
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,320
 You can't cause us very self-involved.

1377
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:20,040
 It's all about my podcast.

1378
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:22,040
 Greg Wallace is a bean guy.

1379
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,040
 That's so weird.

1380
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,240
 It does sound like a dream.

1381
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,240
 It does.

1382
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:26,240
 That is bizarre.

1383
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,240
 It does that, though.

1384
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:28,240
 It happened.

1385
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,240
 Would you like to hear a horrifying fart fact?

1386
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,360
 Now we're approaching the winter months, so you know on a cold day if you breathe out,

1387
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:34,360
 you can see your breath.

1388
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:35,360
 Yeah.

1389
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:39,600
 Well, if you fart loudly enough, you can see your fart on a cold day, but not if you're

1390
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:40,600
 wearing trousers.

1391
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:41,600
 Yes, okay.

1392
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:45,280
 But only a part of like, Winnie the Pooh that is like, "Winnie the Pooh."

1393
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:48,400
 And I think I've read that story.

1394
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:52,320
 Winnie the Pooh on a windy day, that's what that was about, isn't it?

1395
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:54,600
 Yes, another reason not to go out in public naked, eh?

1396
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,280
 I never realized that.

1397
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:59,320
 There must be footage on YouTube of people doing that, right?

1398
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:02,240
 I haven't searched it, but feel free to check it out.

1399
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:05,400
 I rather think it might be on more specialist channels than YouTube.

1400
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,920
 Back to Dan's Only fans.

1401
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,480
 Yeah, that's a new whole threat for me.

1402
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:13,280
 And wiki farts.

1403
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:20,280
 Okay, that's it.

1404
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:21,960
 That is all of our facts.

1405
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:25,920
 We have now reached the by Anne period of the podcast today.

 No such thing as a fish.com.

1422
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:01,280
 week.

1423

 Bye.

1426
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,580
 (upbeat music)
