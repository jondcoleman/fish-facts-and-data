00:00:00,00:00:04,"Hi guys, just before we start this show, we wanted to let you know about last week's show,"
00:00:04,00:00:09,on which you might remember we had a few facts about Leonardo da Vinci that we were slightly suspicious
00:00:09,00:00:13,"about, and we just asked someone if they could get in touch and provide us with a reliable source,"
00:00:13,00:00:18,"so that all these things that sounded too good to be true could be verified as true,"
00:00:18,00:00:24,and someone did get in touch to tell us that they weren't true. I'm afraid Leonardo da Vinci
00:00:24,00:00:30,"doesn't seem to have had a long and lustrous career as a chef, he may not have even made the giant"
00:00:30,00:00:37,"whisk. We fell for a hoax. This is a hoax book that was written in the 1980s, it's called Notast,"
00:00:37,00:00:44,"de Cocina, de Leonardo da Vinci, and it's full of lies, cruel lies that were then repeated in"
00:00:44,00:00:50,"biography, after book, after History magazine, throughout the decade solely for the purpose of"
00:00:50,00:00:56,"making me look like an idiot. Thanks so much to Pedro Almoda, who was the person who emailed in to"
00:00:56,00:01:02,"tell us about that original text, and who also managed to avoid writing in huge capital letters,"
00:01:02,00:01:07,"""You total and utter gullible morons."" Very grateful to him for being so restrained on that front,"
00:01:07,00:01:13,"and for letting us know, and I'm so sorry to the rest of you for saying these things that turned"
00:01:13,00:01:20,"out not to be true, won't happen again. I promise the upcoming podcast is almost entirely true,"
00:01:20,00:01:22,"okay, on with the show."
00:01:22,00:01:42,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:01:42,00:01:47,"from the QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here next to Andrew"
00:01:47,00:01:52,"Hunter Murray, and Edgesinsky, and James Harkin, and once again we have gathered around the microphones"
00:01:52,00:01:58,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in a particular order, here we go."
00:01:58,00:02:05,"Starting with you, James Harkin. Okay, my fact this week is that the least creepy job is that of a"
00:02:05,00:02:15,"weather forecaster. According to you, according to a new paper from this year, in the journal New"
00:02:15,00:02:22,"Ideas in Psychology, called ""On the Nature of Creepiness"" by two scientists called Francis"
00:02:22,00:02:27,T. McCandrew and Sarah S. Kerrnker. And what did they do that they personally meet up with
00:02:27,00:02:34,"creepy people? Yeah. No, what they did is they did a survey of 1,341 people, and they asked them,"
00:02:34,00:02:41,"they gave them a list of a load of jobs and said which of these is the most creepy, and the top creepy"
00:02:41,00:02:51,"job was clown, followed by taxidermist, followed by sex shop owner, now I'm friends with loads of those,"
00:02:51,00:02:57,"hi, and then funeral director and taxidriver. Is that taxidermist because it sounds like taxidermist?"
00:02:57,00:03:04,"Is that the confusion then? So this is only a small list of jobs, so there were 21 jobs in total."
00:03:04,00:03:08,"So things like weird butcher weren't on the list, which might be even the creepy of the clown,"
00:03:08,00:03:13,"yes, weird butcher. You've got the normal butcher and then the next shop is always the"
00:03:13,00:03:20,"weird butcher, who's always rubbing his hands on the awful. So who else is on the list?"
00:03:20,00:03:26,"So the bottom three, as in the least creepy meteorologist or whether forecaster came least creepy,"
00:03:26,00:03:32,"followed by teacher and then farmer, quite surprised by teacher because not that teachers"
00:03:32,00:03:37,"are creepy generally, but you often would hear school children saying about teachers are creepy"
00:03:37,00:03:43,"and stuff, maybe it's a survey done once people have grown up. In nowadays, everyone thinks of teachers"
00:03:43,00:03:47,"being great because you think, oh, well, a good profession to be in. Sort of, everyone has had one"
00:03:47,00:03:52,"creepy teacher though. It's sort of unfair to lump an entire profession into creepiness, isn't it,"
00:03:52,00:03:57,"based on probably one person's experience, a weird physics teacher. I reckon I'd answered that,"
00:03:57,00:04:03,"a creepy job was a hairdresser because I had like one creepy hairdresser once, and then I think"
00:04:03,00:04:07,"that affects your view of the whole profession, doesn't it? Yeah, my parents are hairdressers. Yeah,"
00:04:07,00:04:13,that's the one we're talking about. Yeah. Your mum just really strange. So what is being creepy?
00:04:13,00:04:21,"Okay, so being creepy is kind of a feeling of unease about somebody, and it's interesting,"
00:04:21,00:04:28,I read this paper and they say it's not just that you feel like you're going to be in harm because
00:04:28,00:04:32,"if someone comes at you with an axe, you wouldn't say that's creepy, you'd say that's just scary."
00:04:32,00:04:39,"It's really creepy. It's so creepy, wasn't it? It's all my hand off, it's creepy, it's such a"
00:04:39,00:04:46,"creep. We were talking about this the other day, that there's certain words that I get given over to"
00:04:46,00:04:52,"sort of like murders and stuff that are just a bit too playground. So, copycat. Yeah, that's just"
00:04:52,00:05:00,like stealing my murders. You're nothing but a copycat. That's ridiculous. That's the same creepy.
00:05:00,00:05:05,"But yeah, creepiness is more like the potential to do harm, isn't it? Yeah, or actually, it's"
00:05:05,00:05:10,more like the ambiguity of whether someone might do you harm or might not do you harm.
00:05:10,00:05:16,"So yeah, maybe this is why, because I think this study also had the creepiest hobbies, what people"
00:05:16,00:05:21,"found were the creepiest hobbies for people to have, and the top creepiest hobbies were collecting"
00:05:21,00:05:29,"things, which I think that's, so the examples it gives are dolls insects and body parts."
00:05:29,00:05:33,"Well, I think the dolls insects, I'd be upset if I was loved in with body parts."
00:05:33,00:05:39,"It actually said that body parts such as teeth, bones or fingernails were considered"
00:05:39,00:05:45,especially creepy. So just a few more things from this study before we move on. They asked for creepy
00:05:45,00:05:52,"traits. What they did was they said, imagine a creepy person is talking to your friend, what traits"
00:05:52,00:05:58,"might this creepy person have, and ones that they went for were the person stood too close to your"
00:05:58,00:06:06,friend. The person licked his or her lips frequently. Is that their own lips or the lips of your friend?
00:06:06,00:06:15,"And the person laughed at unpredictable times. I would put, sorry."
00:06:15,00:06:22,I would put oscillating on there as well.
00:06:22,00:06:27,"It's oscillating as in kind of rocking. Yeah, just rocking. I find that a bit odd. I'll be in bookshops."
00:06:27,00:06:32,"There's always an older guy standing looking at a sort of the naughty section of a bookshop,"
00:06:32,00:06:38,"you know, sort of like a romance erotica, and they oscillate. And I always say, don't go near an"
00:06:38,00:06:43,"oscillating man. But is that more down to the position that he's in, as in he's in the in the sexy"
00:06:43,00:06:47,"departments of the bookshop? Like if he was oscillating somewhere else in the bookshop,"
00:06:47,00:06:51,would it be less weird? Because actually like sexual predation is one of the things which
00:06:51,00:06:59,people associate with creepiness of course. That is creepy. Did you guys see that on the list as well
00:06:59,00:07:06,"was bird watching, bird watches. It was quite unfair. And a guy who is a bird watcher"
00:07:06,00:07:11,"wrote an article on his website called Aldobon. And he just wrote, he said, I'm just going to step away"
00:07:11,00:07:16,"from my usual articles because I need to address this creepiness thing. And he said, here are a few"
00:07:16,00:07:20,"of my thoughts. Number one, first of all, only squares. He's the term bird watching. It's birding."
00:07:21,00:07:26,"So that's a serious birder here. Yeah, he sounds like not a square. He sounds like he's a cool guy."
00:07:26,00:07:29,"And he says, and he says as well, like what they're not, what they're suggesting is that bird watches"
00:07:29,00:07:33,just stand there watching birds. It's not about that. It's about going to exotic locations. It's
00:07:33,00:07:38,adventure. This man sounds misinformed because bird watching is not going to look for a rare bird
00:07:38,00:07:41,that's twitching. That's the thing that the bird watching community gets quite annoyed about. So
00:07:41,00:07:44,twitching are the people who are just in it for the excitement who they hear. There's been a
00:07:44,00:07:49,weird parrot spotting in Cornwall and they get down there watching is sitting in your garden
00:07:49,00:07:53,"or in a forest all day, usually listening out for bird calls because you can't see. Well, he does say"
00:07:53,00:07:58,listening and thinking and anticipating. I can't wait for the letters after Anna said that this guy
00:07:58,00:08:03,"who writes a book. I know what I know on the website. On Audubon, which is the most famous bird watching"
00:08:03,00:08:08,"website. Yeah, I think this is it's his site. He just to the final point. Number four is he says,"
00:08:08,00:08:12,"you know, who I think the real creeps are here. These psychologists sitting around thinking about"
00:08:12,00:08:17,"what's creepy all day, constantly asking people, do you think this is creepy? And how about this"
00:08:17,00:08:21,creepy? What a bunch of creeps. I think these scientists should get out of the lab a bit more.
00:08:21,00:08:28,"Maybe pick up a hobby. I know the perfect one. Slam, do you know who came up with the term the"
00:08:28,00:08:34,"creeps? As in that gives me the creeps. Charles Dickens. David Copperfield, that's the first"
00:08:34,00:08:37,"use that the Oxford dictionary has. Well, was it in reference to bird watches? It was not."
00:08:37,00:08:45,And it also around that time mid-19th century creepiness was known as being clammy. That was
00:08:45,00:08:51,"another way of describing someone who was a creep. Oh, yeah, very clammy. Yeah. And so I think the reason"
00:08:51,00:08:56,just to explain why bird watching and it was bird watching and other hobbies that involve
00:08:56,00:09:01,"watching like the other examples given word, taking pictures of people watching children,"
00:09:01,00:09:08,pornography and bird watching. So you can't see why he was upset at being lumped in with those guys.
00:09:08,00:09:15,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. But this study, the study concludes by saying that creepy people are the"
00:09:15,00:09:21,"personification of something called the prospect refuge theory, which is this idea that human seek places"
00:09:21,00:09:26,"where you get refuge, so safety and you get prospect, so opportunity and basically what that"
00:09:26,00:09:32,"means is places where you can hide easily, but you can see lots of other things around you potential"
00:09:32,00:09:37,threats. And I think maybe the idea of people who watch is that they're concealed. So a bird watcher
00:09:37,00:09:42,"is watching you, but often you can't see him if you're a bird. And that's why in like a Victorian"
00:09:42,00:09:46,"house, we'd be creeped out because there are lots of nucks and crannies people could, you know,"
00:09:46,00:09:50,"round corners that people could be hiding in. And if you're on a big open more land, people often find"
00:09:50,00:09:55,"that a bit uncomfortable because there's no way you can hide. Sure. When I used to play laser quest,"
00:09:55,00:10:00,"when I was a teenager, I used to like to hide in the corner so that no one could shoot me."
00:10:00,00:10:04,"Oh, you want to shoot them from where I was? Oh, does that make me creepy? Yes, and I also hate"
00:10:04,00:10:09,"people who do that itself. Yeah, I know. Well, I was all with myself. Yeah, I played two weeks ago,"
00:10:09,00:10:16,"laser quest. Wow, it was great fun. I'm afraid that's the extent of the fact. My fact this week,"
00:10:16,00:10:22,"I'm back in the nine suits. Really good, it's great. So I think it was discovered by maybe Richard"
00:10:22,00:10:28,Wiseman did a study in the early 2000s and some of us before that that any area that has
00:10:28,00:10:33,"infrasound, any sound that's below 20 hertz, which is basically below the level of which humans can"
00:10:33,00:10:37,"hear, makes us creeped out somehow, even though we don't know it. So he did this study in Edinburgh"
00:10:37,00:10:42,"and he sent people to apparently haunted locations and to not haunted, but didn't tell them which were"
00:10:42,00:10:46,which. And they were more scared in the apparently haunted ones. And then he realised that's because
00:10:46,00:10:50,"there was this constant rumble. I think it was caused by the traffic, but it was just below that"
00:10:50,00:10:56,frequency at which we can hear. I'm sure this must be made up. I remember at school someone telling me
00:10:56,00:11:01,"that when Hitler did all of his speeches, what they used to do is before he came on, there was"
00:11:01,00:11:05,it was that kind of noise. So there was an unsettled feeling amongst everyone who was there for
00:11:05,00:11:10,"the speech. And then as soon as Hitler would come out, they would turn the sound off and the matching"
00:11:10,00:11:14,"of the sense of calm from the sound disappearing with this person who you were there to see, it was like,"
00:11:14,00:11:20,"ah, our leaders here kind of thing. Is that true at all? I've read that. I don't know if it's true. Do"
00:11:20,00:11:29,you think Theresa May is just getting to turn the machine off when she starts? Clowning was number one
00:11:29,00:11:35,"on the list of creepy occupations, right? Yeah. So the clowning community is very aware"
00:11:35,00:11:39,that they are being seen as creepy and they need to do something about it. So one of the things is that
00:11:39,00:11:45,they teach people who are petrified of clowns not to be petrified by inviting them to come along and
00:11:45,00:11:50,"they give them clouncyling, they call it, and clouncyling sessions involve meeting the person,"
00:11:50,00:11:54,"they then get done, they're made up done and stuff in front of them, and then you see them in the"
00:11:54,00:12:01,circus and you realize it's a normal person behind the clown face. Did you see this last few weeks
00:12:01,00:12:06,"in the news there have been some clown sightings in South Carolina? No, they're not native to South"
00:12:06,00:12:11,Carolina. That doesn't make any sense. What do you mean clown sightings? So they have been reported
00:12:11,00:12:17,sightings of lurking creepy clowns that people have been telling the police about. Police in South
00:12:17,00:12:23,Carolina have warned that anyone dressed as a clown could face a rest because so many people
00:12:23,00:12:28,have been scared by these clowns. And at least one performer in Georgia has decided to inform
00:12:28,00:12:34,"police of his movements whenever in costume so that he doesn't get arrested. It's not, what's the"
00:12:34,00:12:38,"what's the offense though? Because it's not an offense to be creepy. No, but there's reports of them"
00:12:38,00:12:46,"kind of trying to get children into the woods. There you go. But here's the thing right, in 1981"
00:12:46,00:12:52,there was a very similar thing happening where people saw these clowns and they were supposedly
00:12:52,00:12:58,kind of lowering children into woods and stuff like that. There was one one event where there was
00:12:58,00:13:03,a clown who only had half his clown suit on and he was even more scary because he didn't have the bottom
00:13:03,00:13:10,half on. He was naked from the waist down. But they had over 20 calls at this time and it was in
00:13:10,00:13:16,"the newspapers, but they found out that basically no adults had seen any of these clowns and they reckon"
00:13:16,00:13:21,"that maybe it was just overactive imagination of kids and that was what caused it. Oh, okay. I'm scared"
00:13:21,00:13:28,of clowns again now. All that clownsling I had completely gone out there. Four years of clownsling.
00:13:28,00:13:34,And actually these ones is South Carolina. At the moment I think no policemen has actually seen any
00:13:34,00:13:39,of these clowns either. So they wonder if it also might be another kind of example of mass hysteria.
00:13:39,00:13:43,That's another example of also a playground where it would be effectively what sounds like
00:13:43,00:13:47,"sexual predators out in the go. Those clowns, we'll get those clowns one day."
00:13:50,00:13:56,I have one more creepy thing before we move on. Yeah sure. There was a news report about donations
00:13:56,00:14:01,left to shelter Scotland homeless charity and they gave their weirdest and creepiest donations
00:14:01,00:14:09,a mummified cat and a sack of creepy severed dolls heads with their eyelids glued shut.
00:14:09,00:14:16,Yeah. That was donated to a charity. Don't let it do a charity. What possible use could you have
00:14:16,00:14:21,"in the charity shop? Sometimes the dolls heads fall off and you need a replacement. Well, I love"
00:14:21,00:14:25,these dolls heads but I'm afraid the eyes are just too open for me. No thanks.
00:14:25,00:14:39,"Okay, it's time for fact number two and that is my fact. My fact this week is that self-driving cars"
00:14:39,00:14:45,are playing grand theft auto in order to learn how to drive better. So this is
00:14:46,00:14:52,scientists are basically teaching self-driving cars to identify stuff better and that's quite hard
00:14:52,00:14:57,"when you don't have a program that has things mapped out because you need it, you need to do it,"
00:14:57,00:15:01,you need to teach the algorithms to learn better to understand what every single potential thing
00:15:01,00:15:06,you might encounter on the street is and they realize that instead of having to build all these
00:15:06,00:15:11,"programs that simulate a real life driving experience, why not use something that is extraordinarily"
00:15:11,00:15:17,detailed like grand theft auto and let it play it and let it just understand and start labeling
00:15:17,00:15:22,all the things that you don't want to run over. There's this lab in Germany which has developed
00:15:22,00:15:29,this. It's basically a software layer that sits in between the game and the car and the idea is
00:15:29,00:15:33,that it's just automatically starts classifying all the things and feeding it into the algorithm.
00:15:33,00:15:38,Do you think the game would be annoyed if it knew that it was being played by a not a human?
00:15:40,00:15:45,What do you mean by that Addy? I don't know. I think you thought that was a more profound question
00:15:45,00:15:50,"than it actually was. It's interesting, you've got one virtual reality thing interacting with another."
00:15:50,00:15:54,"Yeah, it's pretty weird. So I read a list of how detailed grand theft auto is now."
00:15:54,00:15:58,Some of the things that they've programmed into it if you were playing the game that you would
00:15:58,00:16:04,notice. So if it begins raining puddles will slowly and realistically form in the road and if you
00:16:04,00:16:10,shave your head or you have a clean shave your hair and stubble will grow at the same rate that
00:16:10,00:16:15,"say if it was mine, like they just calculated one person's growth. It's stuff like that they've really"
00:16:15,00:16:19,"gone into it. But yours is quite fast growth. Yes, mine's a very fast growth. As if it was mine,"
00:16:19,00:16:24,"it wouldn't be fast growth at all. So have they taken an average of everyone? No, I guess I guess"
00:16:24,00:16:30,they've just used one person's. It's the idea of hair growth. So it all... What are the cars going to
00:16:30,00:16:33,do when they're put into real life and they come up against someone who doesn't have such fast
00:16:33,00:16:39,growing hair? They're going to absolutely freak out. On the bright side people always get
00:16:39,00:16:44,"critical of grand theft also and kids playing it because it maybe teaches them to commit crimes,"
00:16:44,00:16:50,but it's quite safe for a car to play a game about stealing cars because a car has no incentive
00:16:50,00:16:55,"to steal a car. It's true, yeah. It's like teaching it about real life. This is what might happen to you."
00:16:55,00:17:01,"Yeah, it's a warning video. Yeah. There was, I read an article about someone who was in a"
00:17:01,00:17:05,Google self-driving car and they were saying that it's really interesting because the car uses a
00:17:05,00:17:12,"mixture of 3D laser mapping, GPS, radar and when they're using the radar, the radar goes through"
00:17:12,00:17:18,objects as opposed to just slapping onto something as it were. Like our eyes do. Yeah. When your eyes
00:17:18,00:17:27,"slap onto something. Yeah, but so as a result, there are moments when this person was in the car"
00:17:27,00:17:33,where the car would suddenly stop because it recognized a cyclist who was halted and they would
00:17:33,00:17:38,have gone into it except for the fact that the cyclist was on the other side of a hedge. So it could
00:17:38,00:17:43,see through the hedge to see a cyclist who was going head on the hedge. Big mist. What would it
00:17:43,00:17:52,"register that has? I don't think cars need to register a thick mist, do they? Pass a certain"
00:17:52,00:17:59,"thickness, mist becomes fog. Okay, so a really heavy fog. I think my point stands. No fog has ever been"
00:17:59,00:18:05,so heavy to act as a wall against a car. So it would have to be what are you saying is that they
00:18:05,00:18:09,don't use cameras. They use radar. Yeah. So it would have to be a fog thick enough to show on radar.
00:18:09,00:18:14,Yeah. Okay. Like a fog of insects. Like sometimes if there's a load of insects kind of like mayflies
00:18:14,00:18:19,"all come at the same time. Right. They show up on radar. What about that, Anna? What about a plague"
00:18:19,00:18:25,"of locusts or cicadas which is in the middle of the road? James, I don't know why you're trying to dig"
00:18:25,00:18:31,Andy out of this. It's very generous. Help me. Help me. I thought it was an extremely profound question.
00:18:31,00:18:40,"Google cars just had their first accident caused by a Google car rather than a person, I think."
00:18:40,00:18:46,Fatality. No. No. I mean the smallest car accident you could possibly imagine. It was in February
00:18:46,00:18:51,this year and it actually exposed something quite clever that I didn't realise they do which is they've
00:18:51,00:18:56,trained Google cars to when you know when you're going along a main road and you need to turn right
00:18:56,00:19:01,off the road and there's traffic coming the other way. So if you just stay in the middle of your lane
00:19:01,00:19:04,then you hold up all the traffic behind you. So what you usually do is edge to the right hand side of
00:19:04,00:19:09,your lane so that traffic can get around you and they've taught the Google cars to do that. So a
00:19:09,00:19:14,Google car needed to turn right so edge to the right hand side of his lane but then spotted that
00:19:14,00:19:17,I don't know why they've installed this in the area where they're training the cars but there's
00:19:17,00:19:22,a bunch of sandbags blocking its route and so then indicated left to get back into the middle of the
00:19:22,00:19:28,lane and it scraped up at two miles an hour against a bus that was coming on its left hand side so
00:19:28,00:19:33,that was pretty dramatic. Was it in Britain this? No. I don't think it was. I think it was in America.
00:19:33,00:19:38,"So that would be turning left rather than right would it? It absolutely would be. I've said,"
00:19:38,00:19:46,so listen to what I just said and then swap round all the left and right and then you've got it.
00:19:46,00:19:51,Have you seen the Rolls Royce one that they've developed? I'll put this up on Twitter but it's
00:19:51,00:19:54,the photo on Twitter but it's worth you guys seeing right now. What's with what are you going to put it
00:19:54,00:20:00,"on? I'll put on QI podcast. This is a design that they're planning to actually release. Yeah, square"
00:20:00,00:20:06,wheels. It's a silver beast that looks like it's from the Jetsons. Isn't it? It's just listening
00:20:06,00:20:10,"to this. No, not on Twitter. It does not have square wheels. It's got sort of wheel guards on it."
00:20:10,00:20:16,Yes. That's right. That's not just a car that's still mounted on its block. It looks like a
00:20:16,00:20:22,"monopoly piece, doesn't it? That's the best way to describe it. Is it real or is it a real car?"
00:20:22,00:20:26,"No, no, it's a real car. Imagine if all the self-driving cars all look like different"
00:20:26,00:20:31,"monopoly pieces. That'd be amazing. Oh my god, driving around it in old boots. Giant top hat,"
00:20:31,00:20:38,cruises past you. And what's the new one? They've introduced the car. It's the internet. You'd
00:20:38,00:20:44,"always swear at the cat, wouldn't you? Just new, fangled youth. Yeah, it's not gone down too well"
00:20:44,00:20:49,"this car in terms of design. I like the design but they said in the article one reviewer, it's called"
00:20:49,00:20:54,"the car, but ugly. And I think maybe a lot of people will agree, but I think there's a very skilled"
00:20:54,00:21:02,"reviewer. It's got a real way with words. Well, the point of driverless cars, I think, of the design,"
00:21:02,00:21:07,"for instance, the Google's going for is to make them look incredibly friendly because we're quite"
00:21:07,00:21:11,"very nervous about handing us our lives over to robots, even though that's not really justified,"
00:21:11,00:21:15,we are. And that looks like a very intimidating car. So I think they've gone entirely the wrong
00:21:15,00:21:19,"direction. So that the Google cars, if you look at them, they've sort of made a face on the front"
00:21:19,00:21:23,"of them. Yeah. Like a friendly face, the lights are a pair of eyes and then below the bumper,"
00:21:23,00:21:28,"it's like a smiling now. Saps, they must take us for the these killer robots are smiling."
00:21:28,00:21:32,"Against true though, because you know the new London red buses, to me, they look like they're"
00:21:32,00:21:36,"pissed off with me. Anytime I see one from the front of mine, that bus is angry with me. That's the"
00:21:36,00:21:44,drivers. And it's because you keep standing in front of them. So there was an interview with a guy
00:21:44,00:21:49,"called Barry Kirk, who was an expert from the Canadian automated vehicle centre of excellence."
00:21:49,00:21:54,And he was very worried that people would start having sex in driverless cars because you're not
00:21:54,00:21:59,"driving. So what are you going to do? Like whenever I'm not driving, I'm always having sex."
00:21:59,00:22:08,That's why the driving to sex driving away from sex or having sex or driving people away from sex.
00:22:08,00:22:14,"He was saying, yeah, he's reckoned that people will be in cars and they'll not be driving and they'll"
00:22:14,00:22:18,"be like, well, what are we going to do? So we'll have sex. And he thinks that's going to be a problem"
00:22:18,00:22:23,"because... All right, Mum. Every school run."
00:22:23,00:22:33,"But yeah, he thinks that this is a problem because when the humans have to kind of take over because"
00:22:33,00:22:38,"something goes wrong, they'll be... They'll be having sex. Right. I'll be playing a board game."
00:22:40,00:22:51,I'll be neatly folding a cardigan. And his post sex ritual. That's at this chat-up-like nice cardigan.
00:22:51,00:23:00,"I'll be folding that later. You know what, your cardigan would look good. Fold it up in a draw."
00:23:00,00:23:09,Do you guys know how old driverless cars are when they date back to? Five years.
00:23:09,00:23:14,Thanks. That's really sweet of you to do that because it's actually much longer ago than that.
00:23:14,00:23:18,It's going to make my fact sound even better. Five thousand years. You do get it.
00:23:18,00:23:26,"No, so the earliest driverless cars date back to the 1920s. And actually, you'll see various"
00:23:26,00:23:31,"articles refer to the earliest one as being called the Linrican Wonder, which was made in 1926."
00:23:31,00:23:35,And it was radio controlled. And so there was someone driving in a car behind it who had a radio
00:23:35,00:23:39,"connection to the car in front. Then I looked, I searched in the British newspaper archive for this."
00:23:39,00:23:45,"And there's actually an earlier one that it referenced in 1921. So this was in Ohio. And again,"
00:23:45,00:23:49,"it was the same idea. It was invented by this guy called Captain Vaughn, who drove another car,"
00:23:49,00:23:54,"17 yards behind it and controlled it with a little remote control. Oh, wow. And the article"
00:23:54,00:23:59,"said to the surprise and dismay of passes by, it made its way through the main streets,"
00:23:59,00:24:03,"obeying the traffic signals, taking the turns and blowing its own horn at careless pedestrians."
00:24:03,00:24:08,So you could also have an automated horn as well. Some things on Grand Theft Auto?
00:24:08,00:24:15,"Yeah, sure. So if you, you can get your character on Grand Theft Auto, look at the smartphone and"
00:24:15,00:24:21,open some websites. And Grand Theft Auto has more websites than North Korea.
00:24:21,00:24:30,Wow. There are 83 sites available on the game. And there are 28 sites in the whole of the North
00:24:30,00:24:37,Korean intra web. Wow. That they're allowed to go. The guy who voices a character called Michael
00:24:37,00:24:42,"in Grand Theft Auto, a guy called Ned Luke, he put on 25 pounds for the role."
00:24:42,00:24:49,For the voice role. Wow. He's a method actor. And he said he wanted to really get into the
00:24:49,00:24:54,"physicality of this role. Put on some weight, dedication. That's amazing. That's incredible."
00:24:56,00:25:02,"If you complete the game, having found every peyote location, this is Grand Theft Auto 5,"
00:25:02,00:25:07,"and complete the mission, the last one, without killing the Sasquatch first."
00:25:07,00:25:15,"And then you play another go of the game as Franklin on a Tuesday between 530 and 830, while the"
00:25:15,00:25:23,"weather is foggy, then you can play as a bigfoot. That's awesome. That's so cool. There must be"
00:25:23,00:25:29,"videos of that on YouTube. Probably. For a long time, it was a conspiracy theory"
00:25:29,00:25:34,"between Grand Theft Auto players that you would be able to do this, but no one knew how to do it,"
00:25:34,00:25:38,"and then someone just found out how to do it. You're describing that, knowing that you've never"
00:25:38,00:25:42,"played it, and neither have I. It was kind of like listening to Grandparents talk about the internet,"
00:25:42,00:25:46,"like yesterday, when my friend's mom asked me to send her an app of the show that I do."
00:25:46,00:25:51,"Yeah, just hearing you trying to pronounce all the words in Grand Theft also."
00:25:53,00:25:57,"Most of those words were perfectly normal, English words. You're just sounded not comfortable doing it."
00:25:57,00:26:11,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy. My fact is that Cucumber is a born with a"
00:26:11,00:26:17,"hook in their upper beak, which is specifically for murdering their siblings. We all have that."
00:26:18,00:26:25,"Okay, that was creepy. So this is what's known, technically, as a morphological specialisation"
00:26:25,00:26:30,for sibling rivalry. So it's basically like having an arm just for hitting your brother with actually
00:26:30,00:26:36,"with my brother, that was his old arm. Well, are you stabbing yourself in the beak?"
00:26:36,00:26:44,"Yeah, so Cucumber is, they have this thing where they always lay three eggs, and they hatch out at"
00:26:44,00:26:51,"separate times. And in about half of Cucumber breads, the youngest one to hatch is killed by the siblings."
00:26:51,00:26:58,"And the siblings, they pick it to death normally, or they push it out of the nest, and it just helps"
00:26:58,00:27:04,"the other two get to a larger weight when they fly the nest, which allows them to be more successful"
00:27:04,00:27:08,"breeding later on. And it's basically done as an insurance policy by the parents, because"
00:27:08,00:27:14,"there is a chance that one of the first two will die, and that will limit your reproductive success."
00:27:14,00:27:20,"So as a result, you have the third one just in case, but normally it's clear that it won't be"
00:27:20,00:27:24,"required. So it's really fruitful. There are substitutes. It's like being on the bench,"
00:27:24,00:27:27,"except at the end of the match, you don't celebrate with the team, you get killed by them."
00:27:27,00:27:37,"There's a few birds that do this, actually. Honeyguides, they do this. And one of the children will"
00:27:37,00:27:42,"peck the other one blindly before it's even opened its eyes. So it's just been born still blind,"
00:27:42,00:27:47,and it just kind of blindly pecks around until it hits its brother or sister and then just murders them.
00:27:47,00:27:53,"And is it as it definitely know what it's doing, or is it kind of just like I've just been born,"
00:27:53,00:27:56,I'm just feeling around. It is not just birds ever know what they're doing.
00:27:56,00:28:04,"It's not an accident. I mean, I think you can really defend the accidental repeated killing"
00:28:04,00:28:09,"of your siblings, just saying you were flailing around. Yeah, definitely. I wouldn't say it's an accident."
00:28:09,00:28:14,"Okay, so they mean nice. So for instance, black Eagles do this as well. And once they were studying"
00:28:14,00:28:21,"them and they found that one of the larger eglets pecked the smaller one, 1,569 times before it died."
00:28:21,00:28:28,So you couldn't really call that an accident. Right. There is a thing about Eagles. This is bold
00:28:28,00:28:34,"Eagles, I think, but it's really interesting. So they have, again, three checks. And the first two to"
00:28:34,00:28:39,"hatch, they have this massive dose of testosterone in the egg yolk. And there's a scientist from the"
00:28:39,00:28:44,"University of Oklahoma called Douglas Mark, who said, I think this is brilliant. The yolk is like a"
00:28:44,00:28:49,"bagged lunch that the kid takes to school. You can either give your kid a lunch packed with steroids,"
00:28:49,00:28:54,"so he'll be abrooted by recess, or you can give him peanut butter. And so the third, the third one"
00:28:54,00:28:59,"born doesn't have the huge mega dose of testosterone. You'd be called in by the teachers, saying your"
00:28:59,00:29:05,"son's lunch box today was a bit the youngest with the peanut butter. That's fine, but old steroids."
00:29:05,00:29:12,That's not an acceptable lunch. So this is also cruel about it. Is the parents sort of deliberately
00:29:12,00:29:16,set the situation up? And sometimes the kids will be fighting and the parent knows which is the
00:29:16,00:29:21,"weakest, the one which needs to die, and will hold that one down so that the others can get at it."
00:29:21,00:29:27,"It's a really bad example to be setting your children, I think. Yeah, it is. Do you know"
00:29:27,00:29:33,otherwise what about kookaburras? Is that the female who gives birth can controls the timing of when
00:29:33,00:29:38,"she lays the eggs, and that's part of her strategy. So by timing them so that the eggs hatch at different"
00:29:38,00:29:42,"times, it means that they're slightly different sizes the kids, so it sets up some to be able to beat"
00:29:42,00:29:47,"the others. But also the first egg that she lays is male, and the second egg is female. So the first"
00:29:47,00:29:53,"egg to hatch is male, second is female, and the third is 50/50. You could go either way. Lucky dip. Yeah."
00:29:53,00:30:00,Wow. And that's strange. You know kookaburras used to be called the ha ha pigeon. Isn't that the best
00:30:00,00:30:03,"nickname? I thought they were called lapping jack asses. They get called that, they have a lot of"
00:30:03,00:30:09,"names. Yeah. The breakfast bird, because they have this really loud laugh, and it sounds like"
00:30:09,00:30:14,"they got called the settlers clock. Well hang on, hang on. Why, you started explaining why they're"
00:30:14,00:30:16,they're called breakfast and they have a laugh.
00:30:16,00:30:16,"- Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,"
00:30:16,00:30:36,You do have to finish these sentences.
00:30:36,00:30:38,I think Ha Ha pigeons the best though.
00:30:38,00:30:43,"There's a very famous Aussie song that we used to sing as kids, Cookebosits on the"
00:30:43,00:30:45,"old gum tree, very classic song."
00:30:45,00:30:50,And I was reading about that song because obviously it is very famous and I googled it and
00:30:50,00:30:55,"what came up was that there's an Aussie show called Spix and Specs, ages ago this happened,"
00:30:55,00:30:59,Adam Hills was the host and it's like never mind the buzz cocks of Australia.
00:30:59,00:31:05,"One of the questions was which song, which famous song has Cookebosits on the old gum"
00:31:05,00:31:10,"tree in it and the answer was ""Men at Works"" ""I come from a land down under."""
00:31:10,00:31:14,Now no one had made that connection before and so the people who own the rights to the
00:31:14,00:31:22,"song Cookebosits on the old gum tree got in touch, sued men at work and won and $4.5 million"
00:31:22,00:31:28,roughly in that region after years and years of them having to battle it out in court got
00:31:28,00:31:32,handed over and they lost the case and they proved that there were two flute moments in
00:31:32,00:31:36,it that copied the lines from this song which was written by an Aussie school teacher and
00:31:36,00:31:38,then handed over to a library.
00:31:38,00:31:47,"That's I bet they felt bad to ever set that question, yeah, I know, it would have been Adam"
00:31:47,00:31:50,"Hills I imagine, yeah."
00:31:50,00:31:55,"Just a headline I found which was sausage-redicted Cookebara ""too fat to fly"" I thought I'd"
00:31:55,00:31:56,share that with you.
00:31:56,00:31:58,And yet you didn't read the full article which I did.
00:31:58,00:32:00,"Oh I did, well yeah."
00:32:00,00:32:02,We all read the article.
00:32:02,00:32:03,So we've done.
00:32:03,00:32:07,"Some links you just can't not click, she was a Cookebara and she became very fat but from"
00:32:07,00:32:08,sausage handouts.
00:32:08,00:32:10,It's the article said.
00:32:10,00:32:15,The article really is kind of summed up quite well in the headline there is nothing to do.
00:32:15,00:32:18,"Yeah reading was quite disappointing, there was very little more to be gained."
00:32:18,00:32:21,Well it gets attacked by dogs at one point and then people notice it.
00:32:21,00:32:22,It's because they smell like sausages.
00:32:22,00:32:29,And someone thought oh no the poor thing it must have broken its wing and been able
00:32:29,00:32:34,to protect itself from the dogs and it's just been eating sausages so it can't fly away.
00:32:34,00:32:35,Did you read that thing?
00:32:35,00:32:36,Someone sent this to us.
00:32:36,00:32:40,"So I think Mark Abrams had retweeted it, Mark Abrams of the ignoble prize had retweeted"
00:32:40,00:32:44,it and it was from Errol Flynn's autobiography.
00:32:44,00:32:46,I saw the tweet but I didn't read it yet.
00:32:46,00:32:48,Okay so what did you read Andy?
00:32:48,00:32:53,It's basically he suddenly says it is autobiography that he started experimenting on ducks.
00:32:53,00:32:58,He's like I did a lot of scientific experiments on ducks and he had read that if you gave ducks
00:32:58,00:32:59,a bit of pork.
00:32:59,00:33:02,So I'm just going off Cookebara's eating sausages.
00:33:02,00:33:06,If you gave ducks a bit of pork it immediately goes through those systems within like two
00:33:06,00:33:08,to three minutes they put it out on the other side.
00:33:08,00:33:12,So he had a thought of what if I tied a bit of string to the pork and let it go through
00:33:12,00:33:18,the duck and he did and so it went through and then he gave another bit of pork to another
00:33:18,00:33:21,duck and another duck and he basically created a string of ducks.
00:33:21,00:33:22,A duck centipede.
00:33:22,00:33:23,A human centipede.
00:33:23,00:33:29,Exactly duck centipede and he used to charge people to come and see his scientific experiments
00:33:29,00:33:31,and people would come and watch duck centipede.
00:33:31,00:33:32,This is awful.
00:33:32,00:33:37,"It's in his autobiography, it's got centipede around on Twitter."
00:33:37,00:33:39,There are some plants which engage in cyblicide.
00:33:39,00:33:40,Really?
00:33:40,00:33:41,Yeah.
00:33:41,00:33:42,Wow.
00:33:42,00:33:46,So there's a tree in India called the Delbergier or Delbergier tree and it makes all these
00:33:46,00:33:49,flat pods full of seeds and the seeds get dispersed by the wind.
00:33:49,00:33:52,It gets spread around so you get more trees elsewhere.
00:33:52,00:33:57,In the seed pod the very first seed to develop produces these chemicals which gas all the
00:33:57,00:34:00,other seeds in the pod.
00:34:00,00:34:01,Wow.
00:34:01,00:34:03,And it means that it is much like clear to be the one which survives.
00:34:03,00:34:04,It's not crazy.
00:34:04,00:34:07,A very clever one.
00:34:07,00:34:17,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is Anachazinski."
00:34:17,00:34:23,My fact is that the first ever mention of paper recommended it as a cure for frizzy hair.
00:34:23,00:34:25,How does this cure work?
00:34:25,00:34:26,Great question.
00:34:26,00:34:27,Well I don't think it does.
00:34:27,00:34:28,Oh.
00:34:28,00:34:29,Is that one?
00:34:29,00:34:30,Sorry James.
00:34:30,00:34:36,I read this in a book called Paper Trail by a guy called Alexander Monroe which is such a
00:34:36,00:34:37,good book.
00:34:37,00:34:38,Really readable.
00:34:38,00:34:39,Really interesting.
00:34:39,00:34:45,And he cited this bamboo document which was found in a Chinese tomb in 217 BC and that
00:34:45,00:34:50,document uses the Chinese for paper in it for the first time.
00:34:50,00:34:56,But the context in which it uses it is it says if a man's hair without reason stands erect
00:34:56,00:34:58,"like worms, whiskers or eyebrows."
00:34:58,00:35:07,"Yeah, I know, I don't maybe worms with different back then."
00:35:07,00:35:11,"If a man stands erect like a worms whiskers or eyebrows, he would have encountered a bad"
00:35:11,00:35:16,spirit to resolve this boiler hemp shoe with paper and the evil will be dismissed.
00:35:16,00:35:20,"That's when paper paper first came into our lives, he has been boiled with a shoe."
00:35:20,00:35:21,Wow.
00:35:21,00:35:22,Amazing.
00:35:22,00:35:25,"So this is the word it's g, is that how you pronounce it?"
00:35:25,00:35:26,True.
00:35:26,00:35:27,Yeah.
00:35:27,00:35:28,"Yeah, is that H.I."
00:35:28,00:35:29,True.
00:35:29,00:35:30,Okay.
00:35:30,00:35:37,And I'm also reading a book about paper at the moment by Mark Kolanski and he has another
00:35:37,00:35:42,"time when they use this word very early, it was in 93 BC and it wasn't when a guard advised"
00:35:42,00:35:46,a prince to hide his deformed nose with a piece of paper.
00:35:46,00:35:50,Did he draw a more perfect nose on the bit of paper and just hold it up?
00:35:50,00:35:51,Didn't save it.
00:35:51,00:35:52,That would make sense.
00:35:52,00:35:55,I like when they do scaffolding on buildings and they put on the outside of the scaffolding
00:35:55,00:35:56,what the new building is going to look like.
00:35:56,00:35:57,"Yeah, exactly."
00:35:57,00:35:58,Yeah.
00:35:58,00:35:59,For a nose.
00:35:59,00:36:00,That's what I clever.
00:36:00,00:36:03,"My mom said when she was a kid, the queen was once visiting the area, she grew up in a Manchester"
00:36:03,00:36:08,"and their line of terraced houses, they decided the cows upside looked a bit skanky and so"
00:36:08,00:36:12,"they put covers on all of their houses, they stopped all in covers so the queen would think"
00:36:12,00:36:13,they were nicer.
00:36:13,00:36:14,Well.
00:36:14,00:36:15,Yeah.
00:36:15,00:36:16,That's amazing.
00:36:16,00:36:17,Yeah.
00:36:17,00:36:18,How weird.
00:36:18,00:36:19,Like a Potemkin village kind of thing.
00:36:19,00:36:20,"Yeah, exactly."
00:36:20,00:36:21,Yeah.
00:36:21,00:36:22,Yeah.
00:36:22,00:36:23,They might as well have just not taken it to Manchester.
00:36:23,00:36:25,They might just take it apart.
00:36:25,00:36:28,"Take it to Bab and say, ""Oh, this is Manchester."""
00:36:28,00:36:30,"""Oh, it looks a lot like Bath."""
00:36:30,00:36:31,"Oh, no."
00:36:31,00:36:32,So paper in China.
00:36:32,00:36:36,"There's a thing in China, it's a sort of tomb sweeping day basically."
00:36:36,00:36:41,"It happens every year and you take paper money, fake paper money to burn at your ancestors"
00:36:41,00:36:42,great.
00:36:42,00:36:43,"Yeah, I used to go and do that."
00:36:43,00:36:44,Did you?
00:36:44,00:36:45,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:36:45,00:36:46,And so is it stacks of...
00:36:46,00:36:48,"I didn't have any ancestors myself, so I just had to use other people's ancestors."
00:36:48,00:36:49,Did you?
00:36:49,00:36:50,"Yeah, yeah, honestly."
00:36:50,00:36:51,It was a thing.
00:36:51,00:36:52,"It was a big day, though, in Hong Kong."
00:36:52,00:36:54,"Yeah, so you buy them a monopoly money and you burn that."
00:36:54,00:36:56,It's money for the dead.
00:36:56,00:37:01,It's a specific currency for the afterlife and you burn it by the grave and it's...
00:37:01,00:37:04,Did the other people not mind that you were doing it for their ancestors?
00:37:04,00:37:05,"Oh, I went with friends."
00:37:05,00:37:10,"And also, there's a lot of grave yards where it's kind of unmarked tombstones and stuff,"
00:37:10,00:37:12,belonging to the Prophet God in person.
00:37:12,00:37:14,"Yeah, was it only money that you were burning then?"
00:37:14,00:37:18,"No, because in Taiwan, is this what you're going to say?"
00:37:18,00:37:23,We've now started burning cardboard iPads for their ancestors so that they can have them
00:37:23,00:37:24,in the other world.
00:37:24,00:37:30,"You get helicopters and whole models of houses and plastic servants, you get, you burn"
00:37:30,00:37:31,a plastic servant.
00:37:31,00:37:32,So they do that.
00:37:32,00:37:36,"They do that largely for funerals as well in China and Taiwan, Hong Kong."
00:37:36,00:37:40,What they do is they build replicas of the things that you had in life and maybe give it
00:37:40,00:37:43,a bit of an extension so that you can bring it into the afterlife.
00:37:43,00:37:44,So I've seen it go by.
00:37:44,00:37:45,You see these huge.
00:37:45,00:37:50,"It's like giant pinata kind of things and they bring it, yeah, to all the cremations and"
00:37:50,00:37:51,so on.
00:37:51,00:37:52,It's amazing.
00:37:52,00:37:53,That's so cool.
00:37:53,00:37:55,"Yeah, do is that you get that in the next life, is it?"
00:37:55,00:37:56,Yes.
00:37:56,00:37:57,Yeah.
00:37:57,00:38:01,"So they will make exactly servants and little, little, you know, Cadillac cars and all"
00:38:01,00:38:02,that sort of stuff.
00:38:02,00:38:03,That's amazing.
00:38:03,00:38:04,Yeah.
00:38:04,00:38:07,So about the history of paper.
00:38:07,00:38:12,"The fact that we have paper now, a lot of it is thanks to Buddhists."
00:38:12,00:38:18,"So when they first started making paper, a lot of it was used for kind of holy books, but"
00:38:18,00:38:22,"if you think about it, a Jewish book like the Torah would be just read over and over again"
00:38:22,00:38:24,the same book.
00:38:24,00:38:27,"If you look in an old Torah, it's like really well worn."
00:38:27,00:38:29,It will be well read.
00:38:29,00:38:32,Christian books would only be read by monks.
00:38:32,00:38:35,"So they don't really need that many of those and the Koran you would just memorize, so"
00:38:35,00:38:37,you don't really need many of those.
00:38:37,00:38:42,"But in Buddhism, you kind of helps you to reach enlightenment that helps you if you just"
00:38:42,00:38:46,"copy things out lots and lots of times and in order to do that, it's better to have a cheap"
00:38:46,00:38:51,writing material and that's where paper came in or one of the reasons why it proliferated
00:38:51,00:38:52,so much in the early days.
00:38:52,00:38:53,Very interesting.
00:38:53,00:38:54,"Oh, that's so cool."
00:38:54,00:38:59,"And we should say we're talking about tree-based paper because you've got papyrus, sorry, tree"
00:38:59,00:39:04,or rags here because you've got papyrus which is earlier and is made of reeds basically
00:39:04,00:39:07,and you've got loads of other styles.
00:39:07,00:39:12,"And actually, when he says tree or rags, this definition of paper that Munro uses isn't"
00:39:12,00:39:13,rags.
00:39:13,00:39:18,He says specifically that paper needs to be plant-based and it needs to be properly pulped.
00:39:18,00:39:21,So it can't even be plant-based and sort of flattened out.
00:39:21,00:39:24,"Paper for him is pulped, plant-based."
00:39:24,00:39:27,So that's what the paper in my original fact refers to.
00:39:27,00:39:28,Okay.
00:39:28,00:39:32,The bizarre thing about the invention of paper which happened probably in like 100 or 200
00:39:32,00:39:37,BC is what you're doing is you're taking bits of plant material.
00:39:37,00:39:42,You're mushing it down so you release all the cellulose which is inside it and then you're
00:39:42,00:39:47,adding water and spreading it out and then the cellulose meshes together and becomes paper.
00:39:47,00:39:50,But no one discovered cellulose until 1838.
00:39:50,00:39:54,So how do you come up with this idea of making paper?
00:39:54,00:39:55,It doesn't make any sense.
00:39:55,00:39:56,That's cool.
00:39:56,00:39:57,"Because yeah, that's it."
00:39:57,00:40:01,"It's all these very, very long fibers that you get and it's better if you boil down your"
00:40:01,00:40:03,tree pulp rather than chopping it up.
00:40:03,00:40:04,"Yeah, yeah."
00:40:04,00:40:05,In the shortness of the fibers loads.
00:40:05,00:40:11,"It was very popular for making kites in China, ancient China and there was a fifth-century"
00:40:11,00:40:15,Chinese emperor who ordered that people should be executed by attaching them to kites and
00:40:15,00:40:20,"having them fly away, which I don't think would have worked in reality but that's what he"
00:40:20,00:40:21,instructed.
00:40:21,00:40:22,Ah.
00:40:22,00:40:23,"Yeah, nice."
00:40:23,00:40:24,What a way to go.
00:40:24,00:40:26,"Quite a nice way to go, I suppose."
00:40:26,00:40:29,"Everyone's singing ""Let's Go Fly a Kites"" as you are."
00:40:29,00:40:33,That would have been a morbid ending to Mary Poppins.
00:40:33,00:40:39,"Actually, one of my favourite things about paper has always been that paper was invented"
00:40:39,00:40:45,"by wasps long, long before it was invented by humans and actually wasps taught us how to"
00:40:45,00:40:46,make paper.
00:40:46,00:40:50,"OK, are you reading my notes?"
00:40:50,00:40:51,You have to explain this.
00:40:51,00:40:54,Do you mean white Anglo-Saxon Protestants?
00:40:54,00:40:56,No.
00:40:56,00:41:02,I wasps that make their nest out of paper essentially and they do it by chewing up wood and pulping
00:41:02,00:41:04,it like we do and then exuding it in the same process.
00:41:04,00:41:07,"Wait a minute, we don't chew up the wood to make paper."
00:41:07,00:41:09,"Oh, is that not how you've done what my notes were?"
00:41:09,00:41:10,That's why they're a bit damp.
00:41:10,00:41:11,But it's kind of it was.
00:41:11,00:41:12,So it's the same process basically.
00:41:12,00:41:16,"It's exactly the same process and in fact, when I say they taught us how to make paper,"
00:41:16,00:41:20,they taught us in the west how to make paper because we were thousands of years behind
00:41:20,00:41:22,the Chinese in this.
00:41:22,00:41:29,So this was in the 18th century a French scientist called Rene Roumure in 1719 saw observe these
00:41:29,00:41:35,"wasps making paper nests and he wrote down in a book saying, I think we could use this."
00:41:35,00:41:37,We could make paper like this as well.
00:41:37,00:41:39,"This seems like a really good thing to do, but never actually tries it."
00:41:39,00:41:45,"And then I think about 50 years later a guy called Jacob Schaffer read his book and thought,"
00:41:45,00:41:46,"yeah, good idea."
00:41:46,00:41:47,I'll give it a go.
00:41:47,00:41:48,And he made paper that way.
00:41:48,00:41:53,"I definitely had paper before that, though, because the Mars brought it over to Spain in the 11th"
00:41:53,00:41:54,century or so.
00:41:54,00:41:55,"Yeah, that's what I thought."
00:41:55,00:41:59,"So I wonder if it is exactly the same process or if it's, I think it might be a different"
00:41:59,00:42:00,moment process.
00:42:00,00:42:05,"The amazing thing is that wasps do not, to this day, know what cellulosis is, incredibly."
00:42:05,00:42:07,They retain the capacity to make paper.
00:42:07,00:42:10,Do you think we're going to be the equivalent of speaks and specs here where a wasp is going
00:42:10,00:42:16,"to be listening to our show, realizing the amount of money they're owed for this invention?"
00:42:16,00:42:24,"So for rag-based paper, cotton-based paper, they needed ammonia to make it."
00:42:24,00:42:28,"And so you would get rag men in lots of large cities going door to door saying, do you have"
00:42:28,00:42:29,any spare urine?
00:42:29,00:42:30,Yeah.
00:42:30,00:42:31,That was the thing.
00:42:31,00:42:34,And people almost always do if you wait long enough.
00:42:34,00:42:42,"In fact, I would say that all urine I produce is spare."
00:42:42,00:42:47,And that is treachery in all the old paper mills. It wasn't just the ammonia of the urine.
00:42:47,00:42:50,They would make the paper out of old rags.
00:42:50,00:42:52,And that would come from like soiled clothing.
00:42:52,00:42:58,And so you would go to a paper mill and it would be the smells of soiled underwear and stuff
00:42:58,00:42:59,and the smell of urine.
00:42:59,00:43:01,And that's basically what it would be like.
00:43:01,00:43:02,Wow.
00:43:02,00:43:03,Great news.
00:43:03,00:43:04,I've just shacked wet myself.
00:43:04,00:43:08,I'm a paper magnate.
00:43:08,00:43:12,"Ooh, what's toilet paper made out of?"
00:43:12,00:43:17,"I was going to say, but if you've pissed yourself, is that then going into, is it like a secure,"
00:43:17,00:43:19,there are two kinds of blue paper.
00:43:19,00:43:25,"So there's what they call virgin blue paper, which is made of tree pulp that has never been"
00:43:25,00:43:26,used for anything before.
00:43:26,00:43:28,It's only been turned into blue paper.
00:43:28,00:43:32,And does that have Richard Branson's face on it?
00:43:32,00:43:41,"And Jeremy Cobb in sat in the toilet, but there's no way for me to sit in here."
00:43:41,00:43:45,"So the other kind is recycled blue paper, which is not recycled blue paper, it's recycled"
00:43:45,00:43:46,things like office paper.
00:43:46,00:43:47,Yeah.
00:43:47,00:43:51,The other thing about these paper mills is at night time they would close them because they're
00:43:51,00:43:53,really noisy.
00:43:53,00:43:57,"But then often they, you know, if they're in a big order, they go all night and everyone"
00:43:57,00:43:58,would complain.
00:43:58,00:43:59,But they close them at night.
00:43:59,00:44:03,And then children would crawl around the machinery cleaning their little bits and pieces.
00:44:03,00:44:09,"And then in the morning they would get hauled out, dried with rough cloths, spanked to remove"
00:44:09,00:44:13,"numbness from their skin, give it a large glass of wine and set to bed."
00:44:13,00:44:17,That's the life of a paper billboard.
00:44:17,00:44:18,Wow.
00:44:18,00:44:19,Wow.
00:44:19,00:44:20,Sounds sort of fun.
00:44:20,00:44:21,Yeah.
00:44:21,00:44:22,It's spanking in wine.
00:44:22,00:44:24,It sounds like 50 shades of gray.
00:44:24,00:44:31,Okay.
00:44:31,00:44:32,That's it.
00:44:32,00:44:33,That's all of our facts.
