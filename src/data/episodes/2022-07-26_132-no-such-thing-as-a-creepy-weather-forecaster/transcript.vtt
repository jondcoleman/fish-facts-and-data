WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720
 Hi guys, just before we start this show, we wanted to let you know about last week's show,

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.840
 on which you might remember we had a few facts about Leonardo da Vinci that we were slightly suspicious

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.920
 about, and we just asked someone if they could get in touch and provide us with a reliable source,

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.560
 so that all these things that sounded too good to be true could be verified as true,

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.800
 and someone did get in touch to tell us that they weren't true. I'm afraid Leonardo da Vinci

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.560
 doesn't seem to have had a long and lustrous career as a chef, he may not have even made the giant

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:37.520
 whisk. We fell for a hoax. This is a hoax book that was written in the 1980s, it's called Notast,

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:44.560
 de Cocina, de Leonardo da Vinci, and it's full of lies, cruel lies that were then repeated in

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:50.320
 biography, after book, after History magazine, throughout the decade solely for the purpose of

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.560
 making me look like an idiot. Thanks so much to Pedro Almoda, who was the person who emailed in to

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:02.640
 tell us about that original text, and who also managed to avoid writing in huge capital letters,

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.920
 "You total and utter gullible morons." Very grateful to him for being so restrained on that front,

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.200
 and for letting us know, and I'm so sorry to the rest of you for saying these things that turned

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:20.000
 out not to be true, won't happen again. I promise the upcoming podcast is almost entirely true,

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.000
 okay, on with the show.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:42.480
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.520
 from the QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here next to Andrew

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.960
 Hunter Murray, and Edgesinsky, and James Harkin, and once again we have gathered around the microphones

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.400
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in a particular order, here we go.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:05.520
 Starting with you, James Harkin. Okay, my fact this week is that the least creepy job is that of a

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:15.440
 weather forecaster. According to you, according to a new paper from this year, in the journal New

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:22.160
 Ideas in Psychology, called "On the Nature of Creepiness" by two scientists called Francis

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.520
 T. McCandrew and Sarah S. Kerrnker. And what did they do that they personally meet up with

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:34.880
 creepy people? Yeah. No, what they did is they did a survey of 1,341 people, and they asked them,

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:41.360
 they gave them a list of a load of jobs and said which of these is the most creepy, and the top creepy

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:51.040
 job was clown, followed by taxidermist, followed by sex shop owner, now I'm friends with loads of those,

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.600
 hi, and then funeral director and taxidriver. Is that taxidermist because it sounds like taxidermist?

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:04.320
 Is that the confusion then? So this is only a small list of jobs, so there were 21 jobs in total.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.640
 So things like weird butcher weren't on the list, which might be even the creepy of the clown,

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.600
 yes, weird butcher. You've got the normal butcher and then the next shop is always the

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:20.160
 weird butcher, who's always rubbing his hands on the awful. So who else is on the list?

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.880
 So the bottom three, as in the least creepy meteorologist or whether forecaster came least creepy,

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.880
 followed by teacher and then farmer, quite surprised by teacher because not that teachers

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.920
 are creepy generally, but you often would hear school children saying about teachers are creepy

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.040
 and stuff, maybe it's a survey done once people have grown up. In nowadays, everyone thinks of teachers

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.600
 being great because you think, oh, well, a good profession to be in. Sort of, everyone has had one

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.400
 creepy teacher though. It's sort of unfair to lump an entire profession into creepiness, isn't it,

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.040
 based on probably one person's experience, a weird physics teacher. I reckon I'd answered that,

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:03.120
 a creepy job was a hairdresser because I had like one creepy hairdresser once, and then I think

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.120
 that affects your view of the whole profession, doesn't it? Yeah, my parents are hairdressers. Yeah,

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.920
 that's the one we're talking about. Yeah. Your mum just really strange. So what is being creepy?

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:21.920
 Okay, so being creepy is kind of a feeling of unease about somebody, and it's interesting,

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:28.400
 I read this paper and they say it's not just that you feel like you're going to be in harm because

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.880
 if someone comes at you with an axe, you wouldn't say that's creepy, you'd say that's just scary.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:39.280
 It's really creepy. It's so creepy, wasn't it? It's all my hand off, it's creepy, it's such a

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:46.160
 creep. We were talking about this the other day, that there's certain words that I get given over to

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:52.480
 sort of like murders and stuff that are just a bit too playground. So, copycat. Yeah, that's just

00:04:52.480 --> 00:05:00.960
 like stealing my murders. You're nothing but a copycat. That's ridiculous. That's the same creepy.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.280
 But yeah, creepiness is more like the potential to do harm, isn't it? Yeah, or actually, it's

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.080
 more like the ambiguity of whether someone might do you harm or might not do you harm.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:16.080
 So yeah, maybe this is why, because I think this study also had the creepiest hobbies, what people

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.360
 found were the creepiest hobbies for people to have, and the top creepiest hobbies were collecting

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:29.200
 things, which I think that's, so the examples it gives are dolls insects and body parts.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.520
 Well, I think the dolls insects, I'd be upset if I was loved in with body parts.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:39.040
 It actually said that body parts such as teeth, bones or fingernails were considered

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:45.760
 especially creepy. So just a few more things from this study before we move on. They asked for creepy

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:52.000
 traits. What they did was they said, imagine a creepy person is talking to your friend, what traits

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.240
 might this creepy person have, and ones that they went for were the person stood too close to your

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:06.560
 friend. The person licked his or her lips frequently. Is that their own lips or the lips of your friend?

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:15.040
 And the person laughed at unpredictable times. I would put, sorry.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:22.400
 I would put oscillating on there as well.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.840
 It's oscillating as in kind of rocking. Yeah, just rocking. I find that a bit odd. I'll be in bookshops.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.720
 There's always an older guy standing looking at a sort of the naughty section of a bookshop,

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:38.080
 you know, sort of like a romance erotica, and they oscillate. And I always say, don't go near an

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:43.280
 oscillating man. But is that more down to the position that he's in, as in he's in the in the sexy

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.520
 departments of the bookshop? Like if he was oscillating somewhere else in the bookshop,

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.920
 would it be less weird? Because actually like sexual predation is one of the things which

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:59.840
 people associate with creepiness of course. That is creepy. Did you guys see that on the list as well

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:06.480
 was bird watching, bird watches. It was quite unfair. And a guy who is a bird watcher

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:11.760
 wrote an article on his website called Aldobon. And he just wrote, he said, I'm just going to step away

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:16.080
 from my usual articles because I need to address this creepiness thing. And he said, here are a few

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.640
 of my thoughts. Number one, first of all, only squares. He's the term bird watching. It's birding.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:26.080
 So that's a serious birder here. Yeah, he sounds like not a square. He sounds like he's a cool guy.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.600
 And he says, and he says as well, like what they're not, what they're suggesting is that bird watches

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.200
 just stand there watching birds. It's not about that. It's about going to exotic locations. It's

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:38.160
 adventure. This man sounds misinformed because bird watching is not going to look for a rare bird

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.360
 that's twitching. That's the thing that the bird watching community gets quite annoyed about. So

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.960
 twitching are the people who are just in it for the excitement who they hear. There's been a

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:49.440
 weird parrot spotting in Cornwall and they get down there watching is sitting in your garden

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.760
 or in a forest all day, usually listening out for bird calls because you can't see. Well, he does say

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:58.800
 listening and thinking and anticipating. I can't wait for the letters after Anna said that this guy

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:03.280
 who writes a book. I know what I know on the website. On Audubon, which is the most famous bird watching

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:08.880
 website. Yeah, I think this is it's his site. He just to the final point. Number four is he says,

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:12.880
 you know, who I think the real creeps are here. These psychologists sitting around thinking about

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:17.840
 what's creepy all day, constantly asking people, do you think this is creepy? And how about this

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:21.840
 creepy? What a bunch of creeps. I think these scientists should get out of the lab a bit more.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:28.240
 Maybe pick up a hobby. I know the perfect one. Slam, do you know who came up with the term the

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:34.080
 creeps? As in that gives me the creeps. Charles Dickens. David Copperfield, that's the first

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.920
 use that the Oxford dictionary has. Well, was it in reference to bird watches? It was not.

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:45.680
 And it also around that time mid-19th century creepiness was known as being clammy. That was

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:51.120
 another way of describing someone who was a creep. Oh, yeah, very clammy. Yeah. And so I think the reason

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:56.800
 just to explain why bird watching and it was bird watching and other hobbies that involve

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:01.760
 watching like the other examples given word, taking pictures of people watching children,

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:08.400
 pornography and bird watching. So you can't see why he was upset at being lumped in with those guys.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:15.120
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. But this study, the study concludes by saying that creepy people are the

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:21.680
 personification of something called the prospect refuge theory, which is this idea that human seek places

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:26.560
 where you get refuge, so safety and you get prospect, so opportunity and basically what that

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:32.400
 means is places where you can hide easily, but you can see lots of other things around you potential

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:37.040
 threats. And I think maybe the idea of people who watch is that they're concealed. So a bird watcher

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:42.960
 is watching you, but often you can't see him if you're a bird. And that's why in like a Victorian

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.160
 house, we'd be creeped out because there are lots of nucks and crannies people could, you know,

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:50.960
 round corners that people could be hiding in. And if you're on a big open more land, people often find

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:55.840
 that a bit uncomfortable because there's no way you can hide. Sure. When I used to play laser quest,

00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:00.400
 when I was a teenager, I used to like to hide in the corner so that no one could shoot me.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:04.880
 Oh, you want to shoot them from where I was? Oh, does that make me creepy? Yes, and I also hate

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:09.680
 people who do that itself. Yeah, I know. Well, I was all with myself. Yeah, I played two weeks ago,

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:16.960
 laser quest. Wow, it was great fun. I'm afraid that's the extent of the fact. My fact this week,

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:22.960
 I'm back in the nine suits. Really good, it's great. So I think it was discovered by maybe Richard

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:28.080
 Wiseman did a study in the early 2000s and some of us before that that any area that has

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:33.040
 infrasound, any sound that's below 20 hertz, which is basically below the level of which humans can

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:37.680
 hear, makes us creeped out somehow, even though we don't know it. So he did this study in Edinburgh

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:42.160
 and he sent people to apparently haunted locations and to not haunted, but didn't tell them which were

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:46.640
 which. And they were more scared in the apparently haunted ones. And then he realised that's because

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:50.880
 there was this constant rumble. I think it was caused by the traffic, but it was just below that

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:56.800
 frequency at which we can hear. I'm sure this must be made up. I remember at school someone telling me

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:01.120
 that when Hitler did all of his speeches, what they used to do is before he came on, there was

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:05.520
 it was that kind of noise. So there was an unsettled feeling amongst everyone who was there for

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:10.080
 the speech. And then as soon as Hitler would come out, they would turn the sound off and the matching

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:14.400
 of the sense of calm from the sound disappearing with this person who you were there to see, it was like,

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:20.640
 ah, our leaders here kind of thing. Is that true at all? I've read that. I don't know if it's true. Do

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:29.280
 you think Theresa May is just getting to turn the machine off when she starts? Clowning was number one

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:35.040
 on the list of creepy occupations, right? Yeah. So the clowning community is very aware

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:39.600
 that they are being seen as creepy and they need to do something about it. So one of the things is that

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:45.360
 they teach people who are petrified of clowns not to be petrified by inviting them to come along and

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:50.480
 they give them clouncyling, they call it, and clouncyling sessions involve meeting the person,

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:54.880
 they then get done, they're made up done and stuff in front of them, and then you see them in the

00:11:54.880 --> 00:12:01.040
 circus and you realize it's a normal person behind the clown face. Did you see this last few weeks

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:06.480
 in the news there have been some clown sightings in South Carolina? No, they're not native to South

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:11.200
 Carolina. That doesn't make any sense. What do you mean clown sightings? So they have been reported

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:17.600
 sightings of lurking creepy clowns that people have been telling the police about. Police in South

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:23.440
 Carolina have warned that anyone dressed as a clown could face a rest because so many people

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:28.800
 have been scared by these clowns. And at least one performer in Georgia has decided to inform

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:34.160
 police of his movements whenever in costume so that he doesn't get arrested. It's not, what's the

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:38.800
 what's the offense though? Because it's not an offense to be creepy. No, but there's reports of them

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:46.400
 kind of trying to get children into the woods. There you go. But here's the thing right, in 1981

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:52.720
 there was a very similar thing happening where people saw these clowns and they were supposedly

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:58.400
 kind of lowering children into woods and stuff like that. There was one one event where there was

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:03.520
 a clown who only had half his clown suit on and he was even more scary because he didn't have the bottom

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:10.480
 half on. He was naked from the waist down. But they had over 20 calls at this time and it was in

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:16.320
 the newspapers, but they found out that basically no adults had seen any of these clowns and they reckon

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:21.840
 that maybe it was just overactive imagination of kids and that was what caused it. Oh, okay. I'm scared

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:28.240
 of clowns again now. All that clownsling I had completely gone out there. Four years of clownsling.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:34.880
 And actually these ones is South Carolina. At the moment I think no policemen has actually seen any

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:39.600
 of these clowns either. So they wonder if it also might be another kind of example of mass hysteria.

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:43.680
 That's another example of also a playground where it would be effectively what sounds like

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:47.680
 sexual predators out in the go. Those clowns, we'll get those clowns one day.

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:56.160
 I have one more creepy thing before we move on. Yeah sure. There was a news report about donations

00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:01.920
 left to shelter Scotland homeless charity and they gave their weirdest and creepiest donations

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:09.840
 a mummified cat and a sack of creepy severed dolls heads with their eyelids glued shut.

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:16.720
 Yeah. That was donated to a charity. Don't let it do a charity. What possible use could you have

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:21.920
 in the charity shop? Sometimes the dolls heads fall off and you need a replacement. Well, I love

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:25.840
 these dolls heads but I'm afraid the eyes are just too open for me. No thanks.

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:39.280
 Okay, it's time for fact number two and that is my fact. My fact this week is that self-driving cars

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:45.200
 are playing grand theft auto in order to learn how to drive better. So this is

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:52.720
 scientists are basically teaching self-driving cars to identify stuff better and that's quite hard

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:57.040
 when you don't have a program that has things mapped out because you need it, you need to do it,

00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:01.920
 you need to teach the algorithms to learn better to understand what every single potential thing

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:06.080
 you might encounter on the street is and they realize that instead of having to build all these

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:11.840
 programs that simulate a real life driving experience, why not use something that is extraordinarily

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:17.360
 detailed like grand theft auto and let it play it and let it just understand and start labeling

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:22.560
 all the things that you don't want to run over. There's this lab in Germany which has developed

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:29.600
 this. It's basically a software layer that sits in between the game and the car and the idea is

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:33.680
 that it's just automatically starts classifying all the things and feeding it into the algorithm.

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:38.880
 Do you think the game would be annoyed if it knew that it was being played by a not a human?

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:45.200
 What do you mean by that Addy? I don't know. I think you thought that was a more profound question

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:50.080
 than it actually was. It's interesting, you've got one virtual reality thing interacting with another.

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:54.960
 Yeah, it's pretty weird. So I read a list of how detailed grand theft auto is now.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:58.320
 Some of the things that they've programmed into it if you were playing the game that you would

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:04.720
 notice. So if it begins raining puddles will slowly and realistically form in the road and if you

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:10.640
 shave your head or you have a clean shave your hair and stubble will grow at the same rate that

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:15.840
 say if it was mine, like they just calculated one person's growth. It's stuff like that they've really

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:19.760
 gone into it. But yours is quite fast growth. Yes, mine's a very fast growth. As if it was mine,

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:24.400
 it wouldn't be fast growth at all. So have they taken an average of everyone? No, I guess I guess

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:30.080
 they've just used one person's. It's the idea of hair growth. So it all... What are the cars going to

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:33.600
 do when they're put into real life and they come up against someone who doesn't have such fast

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:39.280
 growing hair? They're going to absolutely freak out. On the bright side people always get

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:44.640
 critical of grand theft also and kids playing it because it maybe teaches them to commit crimes,

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:50.000
 but it's quite safe for a car to play a game about stealing cars because a car has no incentive

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.600
 to steal a car. It's true, yeah. It's like teaching it about real life. This is what might happen to you.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:01.360
 Yeah, it's a warning video. Yeah. There was, I read an article about someone who was in a

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:05.680
 Google self-driving car and they were saying that it's really interesting because the car uses a

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:12.160
 mixture of 3D laser mapping, GPS, radar and when they're using the radar, the radar goes through

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:18.880
 objects as opposed to just slapping onto something as it were. Like our eyes do. Yeah. When your eyes

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:27.040
 slap onto something. Yeah, but so as a result, there are moments when this person was in the car

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:33.600
 where the car would suddenly stop because it recognized a cyclist who was halted and they would

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:38.640
 have gone into it except for the fact that the cyclist was on the other side of a hedge. So it could

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:43.840
 see through the hedge to see a cyclist who was going head on the hedge. Big mist. What would it

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:52.080
 register that has? I don't think cars need to register a thick mist, do they? Pass a certain

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:59.440
 thickness, mist becomes fog. Okay, so a really heavy fog. I think my point stands. No fog has ever been

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:05.040
 so heavy to act as a wall against a car. So it would have to be what are you saying is that they

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:09.840
 don't use cameras. They use radar. Yeah. So it would have to be a fog thick enough to show on radar.

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:14.880
 Yeah. Okay. Like a fog of insects. Like sometimes if there's a load of insects kind of like mayflies

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:19.760
 all come at the same time. Right. They show up on radar. What about that, Anna? What about a plague

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:25.760
 of locusts or cicadas which is in the middle of the road? James, I don't know why you're trying to dig

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:31.360
 Andy out of this. It's very generous. Help me. Help me. I thought it was an extremely profound question.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:40.640
 Google cars just had their first accident caused by a Google car rather than a person, I think.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:46.800
 Fatality. No. No. I mean the smallest car accident you could possibly imagine. It was in February

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:51.440
 this year and it actually exposed something quite clever that I didn't realise they do which is they've

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:56.480
 trained Google cars to when you know when you're going along a main road and you need to turn right

00:18:56.480 --> 00:19:01.120
 off the road and there's traffic coming the other way. So if you just stay in the middle of your lane

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:04.880
 then you hold up all the traffic behind you. So what you usually do is edge to the right hand side of

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:09.600
 your lane so that traffic can get around you and they've taught the Google cars to do that. So a

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:14.720
 Google car needed to turn right so edge to the right hand side of his lane but then spotted that

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:17.600
 I don't know why they've installed this in the area where they're training the cars but there's

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:22.640
 a bunch of sandbags blocking its route and so then indicated left to get back into the middle of the

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:28.480
 lane and it scraped up at two miles an hour against a bus that was coming on its left hand side so

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:33.520
 that was pretty dramatic. Was it in Britain this? No. I don't think it was. I think it was in America.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:38.320
 So that would be turning left rather than right would it? It absolutely would be. I've said,

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:46.480
 so listen to what I just said and then swap round all the left and right and then you've got it.

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:51.040
 Have you seen the Rolls Royce one that they've developed? I'll put this up on Twitter but it's

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:54.480
 the photo on Twitter but it's worth you guys seeing right now. What's with what are you going to put it

00:19:54.480 --> 00:20:00.560
 on? I'll put on QI podcast. This is a design that they're planning to actually release. Yeah, square

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:06.160
 wheels. It's a silver beast that looks like it's from the Jetsons. Isn't it? It's just listening

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:10.720
 to this. No, not on Twitter. It does not have square wheels. It's got sort of wheel guards on it.

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:16.560
 Yes. That's right. That's not just a car that's still mounted on its block. It looks like a

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:22.720
 monopoly piece, doesn't it? That's the best way to describe it. Is it real or is it a real car?

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:26.400
 No, no, it's a real car. Imagine if all the self-driving cars all look like different

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:31.680
 monopoly pieces. That'd be amazing. Oh my god, driving around it in old boots. Giant top hat,

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:38.240
 cruises past you. And what's the new one? They've introduced the car. It's the internet. You'd

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:44.240
 always swear at the cat, wouldn't you? Just new, fangled youth. Yeah, it's not gone down too well

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:49.600
 this car in terms of design. I like the design but they said in the article one reviewer, it's called

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:54.800
 the car, but ugly. And I think maybe a lot of people will agree, but I think there's a very skilled

00:20:54.800 --> 00:21:02.640
 reviewer. It's got a real way with words. Well, the point of driverless cars, I think, of the design,

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:07.280
 for instance, the Google's going for is to make them look incredibly friendly because we're quite

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:11.440
 very nervous about handing us our lives over to robots, even though that's not really justified,

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:15.760
 we are. And that looks like a very intimidating car. So I think they've gone entirely the wrong

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.360
 direction. So that the Google cars, if you look at them, they've sort of made a face on the front

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:23.040
 of them. Yeah. Like a friendly face, the lights are a pair of eyes and then below the bumper,

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:28.320
 it's like a smiling now. Saps, they must take us for the these killer robots are smiling.

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:32.960
 Against true though, because you know the new London red buses, to me, they look like they're

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:36.640
 pissed off with me. Anytime I see one from the front of mine, that bus is angry with me. That's the

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:44.640
 drivers. And it's because you keep standing in front of them. So there was an interview with a guy

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:49.920
 called Barry Kirk, who was an expert from the Canadian automated vehicle centre of excellence.

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:54.880
 And he was very worried that people would start having sex in driverless cars because you're not

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:59.440
 driving. So what are you going to do? Like whenever I'm not driving, I'm always having sex.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:08.080
 That's why the driving to sex driving away from sex or having sex or driving people away from sex.

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:14.720
 He was saying, yeah, he's reckoned that people will be in cars and they'll not be driving and they'll

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:18.240
 be like, well, what are we going to do? So we'll have sex. And he thinks that's going to be a problem

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:23.920
 because... All right, Mum. Every school run.

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:33.440
 But yeah, he thinks that this is a problem because when the humans have to kind of take over because

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:38.720
 something goes wrong, they'll be... They'll be having sex. Right. I'll be playing a board game.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:51.440
 I'll be neatly folding a cardigan. And his post sex ritual. That's at this chat-up-like nice cardigan.

00:22:51.440 --> 00:23:00.320
 I'll be folding that later. You know what, your cardigan would look good. Fold it up in a draw.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:09.200
 Do you guys know how old driverless cars are when they date back to? Five years.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:14.240
 Thanks. That's really sweet of you to do that because it's actually much longer ago than that.

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:18.480
 It's going to make my fact sound even better. Five thousand years. You do get it.

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:26.560
 No, so the earliest driverless cars date back to the 1920s. And actually, you'll see various

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:31.280
 articles refer to the earliest one as being called the Linrican Wonder, which was made in 1926.

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:35.600
 And it was radio controlled. And so there was someone driving in a car behind it who had a radio

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:39.680
 connection to the car in front. Then I looked, I searched in the British newspaper archive for this.

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:45.440
 And there's actually an earlier one that it referenced in 1921. So this was in Ohio. And again,

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:49.440
 it was the same idea. It was invented by this guy called Captain Vaughn, who drove another car,

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:54.720
 17 yards behind it and controlled it with a little remote control. Oh, wow. And the article

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:59.360
 said to the surprise and dismay of passes by, it made its way through the main streets,

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:03.840
 obeying the traffic signals, taking the turns and blowing its own horn at careless pedestrians.

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:08.080
 So you could also have an automated horn as well. Some things on Grand Theft Auto?

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:15.120
 Yeah, sure. So if you, you can get your character on Grand Theft Auto, look at the smartphone and

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:21.040
 open some websites. And Grand Theft Auto has more websites than North Korea.

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:30.480
 Wow. There are 83 sites available on the game. And there are 28 sites in the whole of the North

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:37.200
 Korean intra web. Wow. That they're allowed to go. The guy who voices a character called Michael

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:42.640
 in Grand Theft Auto, a guy called Ned Luke, he put on 25 pounds for the role.

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:49.440
 For the voice role. Wow. He's a method actor. And he said he wanted to really get into the

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:54.640
 physicality of this role. Put on some weight, dedication. That's amazing. That's incredible.

00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:02.320
 If you complete the game, having found every peyote location, this is Grand Theft Auto 5,

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:07.440
 and complete the mission, the last one, without killing the Sasquatch first.

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:15.120
 And then you play another go of the game as Franklin on a Tuesday between 530 and 830, while the

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:23.920
 weather is foggy, then you can play as a bigfoot. That's awesome. That's so cool. There must be

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:29.920
 videos of that on YouTube. Probably. For a long time, it was a conspiracy theory

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:34.000
 between Grand Theft Auto players that you would be able to do this, but no one knew how to do it,

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.480
 and then someone just found out how to do it. You're describing that, knowing that you've never

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:42.880
 played it, and neither have I. It was kind of like listening to Grandparents talk about the internet,

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:46.960
 like yesterday, when my friend's mom asked me to send her an app of the show that I do.

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:51.840
 Yeah, just hearing you trying to pronounce all the words in Grand Theft also.

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:57.360
 Most of those words were perfectly normal, English words. You're just sounded not comfortable doing it.

00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:11.520
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy. My fact is that Cucumber is a born with a

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:17.040
 hook in their upper beak, which is specifically for murdering their siblings. We all have that.

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:25.200
 Okay, that was creepy. So this is what's known, technically, as a morphological specialisation

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:30.080
 for sibling rivalry. So it's basically like having an arm just for hitting your brother with actually

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:36.480
 with my brother, that was his old arm. Well, are you stabbing yourself in the beak?

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:44.800
 Yeah, so Cucumber is, they have this thing where they always lay three eggs, and they hatch out at

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:51.840
 separate times. And in about half of Cucumber breads, the youngest one to hatch is killed by the siblings.

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:58.240
 And the siblings, they pick it to death normally, or they push it out of the nest, and it just helps

00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:04.160
 the other two get to a larger weight when they fly the nest, which allows them to be more successful

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:08.800
 breeding later on. And it's basically done as an insurance policy by the parents, because

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:14.640
 there is a chance that one of the first two will die, and that will limit your reproductive success.

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:20.560
 So as a result, you have the third one just in case, but normally it's clear that it won't be

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:24.320
 required. So it's really fruitful. There are substitutes. It's like being on the bench,

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:27.440
 except at the end of the match, you don't celebrate with the team, you get killed by them.

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:37.520
 There's a few birds that do this, actually. Honeyguides, they do this. And one of the children will

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:42.800
 peck the other one blindly before it's even opened its eyes. So it's just been born still blind,

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:47.760
 and it just kind of blindly pecks around until it hits its brother or sister and then just murders them.

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:53.360
 And is it as it definitely know what it's doing, or is it kind of just like I've just been born,

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:56.400
 I'm just feeling around. It is not just birds ever know what they're doing.

00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:04.560
 It's not an accident. I mean, I think you can really defend the accidental repeated killing

00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:09.200
 of your siblings, just saying you were flailing around. Yeah, definitely. I wouldn't say it's an accident.

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:14.800
 Okay, so they mean nice. So for instance, black Eagles do this as well. And once they were studying

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:21.840
 them and they found that one of the larger eglets pecked the smaller one, 1,569 times before it died.

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:28.400
 So you couldn't really call that an accident. Right. There is a thing about Eagles. This is bold

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:34.800
 Eagles, I think, but it's really interesting. So they have, again, three checks. And the first two to

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:39.840
 hatch, they have this massive dose of testosterone in the egg yolk. And there's a scientist from the

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:44.320
 University of Oklahoma called Douglas Mark, who said, I think this is brilliant. The yolk is like a

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:49.680
 bagged lunch that the kid takes to school. You can either give your kid a lunch packed with steroids,

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:54.960
 so he'll be abrooted by recess, or you can give him peanut butter. And so the third, the third one

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:59.680
 born doesn't have the huge mega dose of testosterone. You'd be called in by the teachers, saying your

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:05.360
 son's lunch box today was a bit the youngest with the peanut butter. That's fine, but old steroids.

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:12.560
 That's not an acceptable lunch. So this is also cruel about it. Is the parents sort of deliberately

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:16.400
 set the situation up? And sometimes the kids will be fighting and the parent knows which is the

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:21.280
 weakest, the one which needs to die, and will hold that one down so that the others can get at it.

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:27.520
 It's a really bad example to be setting your children, I think. Yeah, it is. Do you know

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:33.040
 otherwise what about kookaburras? Is that the female who gives birth can controls the timing of when

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:38.080
 she lays the eggs, and that's part of her strategy. So by timing them so that the eggs hatch at different

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:42.240
 times, it means that they're slightly different sizes the kids, so it sets up some to be able to beat

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:47.600
 the others. But also the first egg that she lays is male, and the second egg is female. So the first

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:53.280
 egg to hatch is male, second is female, and the third is 50/50. You could go either way. Lucky dip. Yeah.

00:29:53.280 --> 00:30:00.080
 Wow. And that's strange. You know kookaburras used to be called the ha ha pigeon. Isn't that the best

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:03.680
 nickname? I thought they were called lapping jack asses. They get called that, they have a lot of

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:09.680
 names. Yeah. The breakfast bird, because they have this really loud laugh, and it sounds like

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:14.560
 they got called the settlers clock. Well hang on, hang on. Why, you started explaining why they're

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:16.240
 they're called breakfast and they have a laugh.

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:16.240
 - Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:36.360
 You do have to finish these sentences.

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.520
 I think Ha Ha pigeons the best though.

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:43.200
 There's a very famous Aussie song that we used to sing as kids, Cookebosits on the

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:45.440
 old gum tree, very classic song.

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:50.160
 And I was reading about that song because obviously it is very famous and I googled it and

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:55.760
 what came up was that there's an Aussie show called Spix and Specs, ages ago this happened,

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:59.880
 Adam Hills was the host and it's like never mind the buzz cocks of Australia.

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:05.680
 One of the questions was which song, which famous song has Cookebosits on the old gum

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:10.480
 tree in it and the answer was "Men at Works" "I come from a land down under."

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:14.880
 Now no one had made that connection before and so the people who own the rights to the

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:22.640
 song Cookebosits on the old gum tree got in touch, sued men at work and won and $4.5 million

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:28.040
 roughly in that region after years and years of them having to battle it out in court got

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:32.280
 handed over and they lost the case and they proved that there were two flute moments in

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:36.760
 it that copied the lines from this song which was written by an Aussie school teacher and

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:38.560
 then handed over to a library.

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:47.840
 That's I bet they felt bad to ever set that question, yeah, I know, it would have been Adam

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:50.040
 Hills I imagine, yeah.

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:55.560
 Just a headline I found which was sausage-redicted Cookebara "too fat to fly" I thought I'd

00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:56.560
 share that with you.

00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:58.240
 And yet you didn't read the full article which I did.

00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:00.200
 Oh I did, well yeah.

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:02.200
 We all read the article.

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:03.200
 So we've done.

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:07.600
 Some links you just can't not click, she was a Cookebara and she became very fat but from

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:08.600
 sausage handouts.

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:10.680
 It's the article said.

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:15.600
 The article really is kind of summed up quite well in the headline there is nothing to do.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:18.560
 Yeah reading was quite disappointing, there was very little more to be gained.

00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:21.200
 Well it gets attacked by dogs at one point and then people notice it.

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:22.880
 It's because they smell like sausages.

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:29.280
 And someone thought oh no the poor thing it must have broken its wing and been able

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:34.520
 to protect itself from the dogs and it's just been eating sausages so it can't fly away.

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:35.520
 Did you read that thing?

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:36.520
 Someone sent this to us.

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:40.440
 So I think Mark Abrams had retweeted it, Mark Abrams of the ignoble prize had retweeted

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:44.520
 it and it was from Errol Flynn's autobiography.

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:46.400
 I saw the tweet but I didn't read it yet.

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:48.520
 Okay so what did you read Andy?

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:53.600
 It's basically he suddenly says it is autobiography that he started experimenting on ducks.

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:58.720
 He's like I did a lot of scientific experiments on ducks and he had read that if you gave ducks

00:32:58.720 --> 00:32:59.720
 a bit of pork.

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:02.600
 So I'm just going off Cookebara's eating sausages.

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:06.360
 If you gave ducks a bit of pork it immediately goes through those systems within like two

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:08.520
 to three minutes they put it out on the other side.

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:12.720
 So he had a thought of what if I tied a bit of string to the pork and let it go through

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:18.280
 the duck and he did and so it went through and then he gave another bit of pork to another

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:21.680
 duck and another duck and he basically created a string of ducks.

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:22.680
 A duck centipede.

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:23.680
 A human centipede.

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:29.520
 Exactly duck centipede and he used to charge people to come and see his scientific experiments

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:31.480
 and people would come and watch duck centipede.

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:32.480
 This is awful.

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:37.080
 It's in his autobiography, it's got centipede around on Twitter.

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:39.800
 There are some plants which engage in cyblicide.

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:40.800
 Really?

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:41.800
 Yeah.

00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:42.800
 Wow.

00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:46.520
 So there's a tree in India called the Delbergier or Delbergier tree and it makes all these

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:49.760
 flat pods full of seeds and the seeds get dispersed by the wind.

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:52.960
 It gets spread around so you get more trees elsewhere.

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:57.840
 In the seed pod the very first seed to develop produces these chemicals which gas all the

00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:00.240
 other seeds in the pod.

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:01.240
 Wow.

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:03.400
 And it means that it is much like clear to be the one which survives.

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:04.400
 It's not crazy.

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:07.880
 A very clever one.

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:17.320
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is Anachazinski.

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:23.760
 My fact is that the first ever mention of paper recommended it as a cure for frizzy hair.

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.680
 How does this cure work?

00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:26.680
 Great question.

00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:27.680
 Well I don't think it does.

00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:28.680
 Oh.

00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:29.680
 Is that one?

00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:30.680
 Sorry James.

00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:36.400
 I read this in a book called Paper Trail by a guy called Alexander Monroe which is such a

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:37.400
 good book.

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:38.400
 Really readable.

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:39.480
 Really interesting.

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:45.000
 And he cited this bamboo document which was found in a Chinese tomb in 217 BC and that

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:50.280
 document uses the Chinese for paper in it for the first time.

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:56.000
 But the context in which it uses it is it says if a man's hair without reason stands erect

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.680
 like worms, whiskers or eyebrows.

00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:07.000
 Yeah, I know, I don't maybe worms with different back then.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.200
 If a man stands erect like a worms whiskers or eyebrows, he would have encountered a bad

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:16.440
 spirit to resolve this boiler hemp shoe with paper and the evil will be dismissed.

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:20.880
 That's when paper paper first came into our lives, he has been boiled with a shoe.

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:21.880
 Wow.

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:22.880
 Amazing.

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:25.840
 So this is the word it's g, is that how you pronounce it?

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:26.840
 True.

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:27.840
 Yeah.

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:28.840
 Yeah, is that H.I.

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:29.840
 True.

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:30.840
 Okay.

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:37.200
 And I'm also reading a book about paper at the moment by Mark Kolanski and he has another

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:42.640
 time when they use this word very early, it was in 93 BC and it wasn't when a guard advised

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:46.480
 a prince to hide his deformed nose with a piece of paper.

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:50.480
 Did he draw a more perfect nose on the bit of paper and just hold it up?

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:51.480
 Didn't save it.

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:52.480
 That would make sense.

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:55.400
 I like when they do scaffolding on buildings and they put on the outside of the scaffolding

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:56.400
 what the new building is going to look like.

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:57.400
 Yeah, exactly.

00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:58.400
 Yeah.

00:35:58.400 --> 00:35:59.400
 For a nose.

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:00.400
 That's what I clever.

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:03.920
 My mom said when she was a kid, the queen was once visiting the area, she grew up in a Manchester

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:08.560
 and their line of terraced houses, they decided the cows upside looked a bit skanky and so

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:12.560
 they put covers on all of their houses, they stopped all in covers so the queen would think

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:13.560
 they were nicer.

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:14.560
 Well.

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:15.560
 Yeah.

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:16.560
 That's amazing.

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:17.560
 Yeah.

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:18.560
 How weird.

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:19.560
 Like a Potemkin village kind of thing.

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:20.560
 Yeah, exactly.

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:21.560
 Yeah.

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:22.560
 Yeah.

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:23.560
 They might as well have just not taken it to Manchester.

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:25.760
 They might just take it apart.

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:28.120
 Take it to Bab and say, "Oh, this is Manchester."

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:30.720
 "Oh, it looks a lot like Bath."

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:31.720
 Oh, no.

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:32.720
 So paper in China.

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:36.960
 There's a thing in China, it's a sort of tomb sweeping day basically.

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:41.360
 It happens every year and you take paper money, fake paper money to burn at your ancestors

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:42.360
 great.

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:43.360
 Yeah, I used to go and do that.

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:44.360
 Did you?

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:45.360
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:46.360
 And so is it stacks of...

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:48.360
 I didn't have any ancestors myself, so I just had to use other people's ancestors.

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:49.360
 Did you?

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:50.360
 Yeah, yeah, honestly.

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:51.360
 It was a thing.

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:52.360
 It was a big day, though, in Hong Kong.

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:54.880
 Yeah, so you buy them a monopoly money and you burn that.

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:56.920
 It's money for the dead.

00:36:56.920 --> 00:37:01.480
 It's a specific currency for the afterlife and you burn it by the grave and it's...

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:04.000
 Did the other people not mind that you were doing it for their ancestors?

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.360
 Oh, I went with friends.

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:10.600
 And also, there's a lot of grave yards where it's kind of unmarked tombstones and stuff,

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:12.760
 belonging to the Prophet God in person.

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:14.960
 Yeah, was it only money that you were burning then?

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:18.320
 No, because in Taiwan, is this what you're going to say?

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:23.400
 We've now started burning cardboard iPads for their ancestors so that they can have them

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:24.920
 in the other world.

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:30.320
 You get helicopters and whole models of houses and plastic servants, you get, you burn

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:31.320
 a plastic servant.

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:32.320
 So they do that.

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:36.400
 They do that largely for funerals as well in China and Taiwan, Hong Kong.

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:40.840
 What they do is they build replicas of the things that you had in life and maybe give it

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:43.760
 a bit of an extension so that you can bring it into the afterlife.

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:44.920
 So I've seen it go by.

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:45.920
 You see these huge.

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:50.400
 It's like giant pinata kind of things and they bring it, yeah, to all the cremations and

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:51.400
 so on.

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:52.400
 It's amazing.

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:53.400
 That's so cool.

00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:55.720
 Yeah, do is that you get that in the next life, is it?

00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:56.720
 Yes.

00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:57.720
 Yeah.

00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:01.120
 So they will make exactly servants and little, little, you know, Cadillac cars and all

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:02.120
 that sort of stuff.

00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:03.120
 That's amazing.

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:04.120
 Yeah.

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:07.360
 So about the history of paper.

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:12.760
 The fact that we have paper now, a lot of it is thanks to Buddhists.

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:18.360
 So when they first started making paper, a lot of it was used for kind of holy books, but

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:22.800
 if you think about it, a Jewish book like the Torah would be just read over and over again

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:24.280
 the same book.

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:27.520
 If you look in an old Torah, it's like really well worn.

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:29.240
 It will be well read.

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:32.000
 Christian books would only be read by monks.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.680
 So they don't really need that many of those and the Koran you would just memorize, so

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.440
 you don't really need many of those.

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:42.000
 But in Buddhism, you kind of helps you to reach enlightenment that helps you if you just

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.800
 copy things out lots and lots of times and in order to do that, it's better to have a cheap

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:51.400
 writing material and that's where paper came in or one of the reasons why it proliferated

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:52.400
 so much in the early days.

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:53.400
 Very interesting.

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:54.400
 Oh, that's so cool.

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:59.800
 And we should say we're talking about tree-based paper because you've got papyrus, sorry, tree

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:04.520
 or rags here because you've got papyrus which is earlier and is made of reeds basically

00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:07.400
 and you've got loads of other styles.

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:12.560
 And actually, when he says tree or rags, this definition of paper that Munro uses isn't

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:13.560
 rags.

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:18.600
 He says specifically that paper needs to be plant-based and it needs to be properly pulped.

00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:21.840
 So it can't even be plant-based and sort of flattened out.

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:24.560
 Paper for him is pulped, plant-based.

00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:27.560
 So that's what the paper in my original fact refers to.

00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:28.560
 Okay.

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:32.760
 The bizarre thing about the invention of paper which happened probably in like 100 or 200

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:37.680
 BC is what you're doing is you're taking bits of plant material.

00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:42.400
 You're mushing it down so you release all the cellulose which is inside it and then you're

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:47.320
 adding water and spreading it out and then the cellulose meshes together and becomes paper.

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:50.900
 But no one discovered cellulose until 1838.

00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:54.360
 So how do you come up with this idea of making paper?

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:55.360
 It doesn't make any sense.

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:56.360
 That's cool.

00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:57.360
 Because yeah, that's it.

00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:01.960
 It's all these very, very long fibers that you get and it's better if you boil down your

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:03.840
 tree pulp rather than chopping it up.

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:04.840
 Yeah, yeah.

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:05.840
 In the shortness of the fibers loads.

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:11.120
 It was very popular for making kites in China, ancient China and there was a fifth-century

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:15.520
 Chinese emperor who ordered that people should be executed by attaching them to kites and

00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:20.520
 having them fly away, which I don't think would have worked in reality but that's what he

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:21.520
 instructed.

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:22.520
 Ah.

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:23.520
 Yeah, nice.

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:24.520
 What a way to go.

00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:26.880
 Quite a nice way to go, I suppose.

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:29.480
 Everyone's singing "Let's Go Fly a Kites" as you are.

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:33.560
 That would have been a morbid ending to Mary Poppins.

00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:39.320
 Actually, one of my favourite things about paper has always been that paper was invented

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:45.160
 by wasps long, long before it was invented by humans and actually wasps taught us how to

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:46.160
 make paper.

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:50.720
 OK, are you reading my notes?

00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:51.720
 You have to explain this.

00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:54.600
 Do you mean white Anglo-Saxon Protestants?

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:56.840
 No.

00:40:56.840 --> 00:41:02.160
 I wasps that make their nest out of paper essentially and they do it by chewing up wood and pulping

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:04.280
 it like we do and then exuding it in the same process.

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:07.000
 Wait a minute, we don't chew up the wood to make paper.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000
 Oh, is that not how you've done what my notes were?

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.800
 That's why they're a bit damp.

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:11.800
 But it's kind of it was.

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:12.800
 So it's the same process basically.

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:16.600
 It's exactly the same process and in fact, when I say they taught us how to make paper,

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:20.520
 they taught us in the west how to make paper because we were thousands of years behind

00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:22.320
 the Chinese in this.

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:29.720
 So this was in the 18th century a French scientist called Rene Roumure in 1719 saw observe these

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:35.880
 wasps making paper nests and he wrote down in a book saying, I think we could use this.

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:37.200
 We could make paper like this as well.

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:39.840
 This seems like a really good thing to do, but never actually tries it.

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:45.160
 And then I think about 50 years later a guy called Jacob Schaffer read his book and thought,

00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:46.160
 yeah, good idea.

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:47.160
 I'll give it a go.

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:48.160
 And he made paper that way.

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:53.480
 I definitely had paper before that, though, because the Mars brought it over to Spain in the 11th

00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:54.480
 century or so.

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:55.480
 Yeah, that's what I thought.

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:59.880
 So I wonder if it is exactly the same process or if it's, I think it might be a different

00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:00.880
 moment process.

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:05.880
 The amazing thing is that wasps do not, to this day, know what cellulosis is, incredibly.

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:07.880
 They retain the capacity to make paper.

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:10.800
 Do you think we're going to be the equivalent of speaks and specs here where a wasp is going

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:16.960
 to be listening to our show, realizing the amount of money they're owed for this invention?

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:24.000
 So for rag-based paper, cotton-based paper, they needed ammonia to make it.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.200
 And so you would get rag men in lots of large cities going door to door saying, do you have

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:29.200
 any spare urine?

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:30.200
 Yeah.

00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:31.200
 That was the thing.

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:34.160
 And people almost always do if you wait long enough.

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:42.920
 In fact, I would say that all urine I produce is spare.

00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:47.800
 And that is treachery in all the old paper mills. It wasn't just the ammonia of the urine.

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:50.000
 They would make the paper out of old rags.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.720
 And that would come from like soiled clothing.

00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:58.040
 And so you would go to a paper mill and it would be the smells of soiled underwear and stuff

00:42:58.040 --> 00:42:59.800
 and the smell of urine.

00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:01.280
 And that's basically what it would be like.

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:02.280
 Wow.

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:03.280
 Great news.

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:04.280
 I've just shacked wet myself.

00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:08.240
 I'm a paper magnate.

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:12.280
 Ooh, what's toilet paper made out of?

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:17.560
 I was going to say, but if you've pissed yourself, is that then going into, is it like a secure,

00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:19.560
 there are two kinds of blue paper.

00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:25.440
 So there's what they call virgin blue paper, which is made of tree pulp that has never been

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:26.440
 used for anything before.

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:28.520
 It's only been turned into blue paper.

00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:32.520
 And does that have Richard Branson's face on it?

00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:41.120
 And Jeremy Cobb in sat in the toilet, but there's no way for me to sit in here.

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:45.600
 So the other kind is recycled blue paper, which is not recycled blue paper, it's recycled

00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:46.600
 things like office paper.

00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:47.600
 Yeah.

00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:51.120
 The other thing about these paper mills is at night time they would close them because they're

00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:53.120
 really noisy.

00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:57.040
 But then often they, you know, if they're in a big order, they go all night and everyone

00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:58.040
 would complain.

00:43:58.040 --> 00:43:59.240
 But they close them at night.

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:03.800
 And then children would crawl around the machinery cleaning their little bits and pieces.

00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:09.240
 And then in the morning they would get hauled out, dried with rough cloths, spanked to remove

00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:13.840
 numbness from their skin, give it a large glass of wine and set to bed.

00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:17.240
 That's the life of a paper billboard.

00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:18.240
 Wow.

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:19.240
 Wow.

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:20.240
 Sounds sort of fun.

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:21.240
 Yeah.

00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:22.240
 It's spanking in wine.

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:24.240
 It sounds like 50 shades of gray.

00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:31.240
 Okay.

00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:32.240
 That's it.

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:33.240
 That's all of our facts.

00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:34.240
