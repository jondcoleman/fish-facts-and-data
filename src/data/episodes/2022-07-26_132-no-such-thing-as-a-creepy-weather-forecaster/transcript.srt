00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
 Hi guys, just before we start this show, we wanted to let you know about last week's show,

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,840
 on which you might remember we had a few facts about Leonardo da Vinci that we were slightly suspicious

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,920
 about, and we just asked someone if they could get in touch and provide us with a reliable source,

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,560
 so that all these things that sounded too good to be true could be verified as true,

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,800
 and someone did get in touch to tell us that they weren't true. I'm afraid Leonardo da Vinci

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,560
 doesn't seem to have had a long and lustrous career as a chef, he may not have even made the giant

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:37,520
 whisk. We fell for a hoax. This is a hoax book that was written in the 1980s, it's called Notast,

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:44,560
 de Cocina, de Leonardo da Vinci, and it's full of lies, cruel lies that were then repeated in

9
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:50,320
 biography, after book, after History magazine, throughout the decade solely for the purpose of

10
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,560
 making me look like an idiot. Thanks so much to Pedro Almoda, who was the person who emailed in to

11
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:02,640
 tell us about that original text, and who also managed to avoid writing in huge capital letters,

12
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,920
 "You total and utter gullible morons." Very grateful to him for being so restrained on that front,

13
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,200
 and for letting us know, and I'm so sorry to the rest of you for saying these things that turned

14
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:20,000
 out not to be true, won't happen again. I promise the upcoming podcast is almost entirely true,

15
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,000
 okay, on with the show.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:42,480
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

17
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:47,520
 from the QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here next to Andrew

18
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,960
 Hunter Murray, and Edgesinsky, and James Harkin, and once again we have gathered around the microphones

19
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,400
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in a particular order, here we go.

20
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:05,520
 Starting with you, James Harkin. Okay, my fact this week is that the least creepy job is that of a

21
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:15,440
 weather forecaster. According to you, according to a new paper from this year, in the journal New

22
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:22,160
 Ideas in Psychology, called "On the Nature of Creepiness" by two scientists called Francis

23
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,520
 T. McCandrew and Sarah S. Kerrnker. And what did they do that they personally meet up with

24
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:34,880
 creepy people? Yeah. No, what they did is they did a survey of 1,341 people, and they asked them,

25
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:41,360
 they gave them a list of a load of jobs and said which of these is the most creepy, and the top creepy

26
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:51,040
 job was clown, followed by taxidermist, followed by sex shop owner, now I'm friends with loads of those,

27
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:57,600
 hi, and then funeral director and taxidriver. Is that taxidermist because it sounds like taxidermist?

28
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:04,320
 Is that the confusion then? So this is only a small list of jobs, so there were 21 jobs in total.

29
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,640
 So things like weird butcher weren't on the list, which might be even the creepy of the clown,

30
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,600
 yes, weird butcher. You've got the normal butcher and then the next shop is always the

31
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:20,160
 weird butcher, who's always rubbing his hands on the awful. So who else is on the list?

32
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:26,880
 So the bottom three, as in the least creepy meteorologist or whether forecaster came least creepy,

33
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:32,880
 followed by teacher and then farmer, quite surprised by teacher because not that teachers

34
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,920
 are creepy generally, but you often would hear school children saying about teachers are creepy

35
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,040
 and stuff, maybe it's a survey done once people have grown up. In nowadays, everyone thinks of teachers

36
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,600
 being great because you think, oh, well, a good profession to be in. Sort of, everyone has had one

37
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:52,400
 creepy teacher though. It's sort of unfair to lump an entire profession into creepiness, isn't it,

38
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,040
 based on probably one person's experience, a weird physics teacher. I reckon I'd answered that,

39
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:03,120
 a creepy job was a hairdresser because I had like one creepy hairdresser once, and then I think

40
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,120
 that affects your view of the whole profession, doesn't it? Yeah, my parents are hairdressers. Yeah,

41
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:13,920
 that's the one we're talking about. Yeah. Your mum just really strange. So what is being creepy?

42
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:21,920
 Okay, so being creepy is kind of a feeling of unease about somebody, and it's interesting,

43
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:28,400
 I read this paper and they say it's not just that you feel like you're going to be in harm because

44
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,880
 if someone comes at you with an axe, you wouldn't say that's creepy, you'd say that's just scary.

45
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:39,280
 It's really creepy. It's so creepy, wasn't it? It's all my hand off, it's creepy, it's such a

46
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:46,160
 creep. We were talking about this the other day, that there's certain words that I get given over to

47
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:52,480
 sort of like murders and stuff that are just a bit too playground. So, copycat. Yeah, that's just

48
00:04:52,480 --> 00:05:00,960
 like stealing my murders. You're nothing but a copycat. That's ridiculous. That's the same creepy.

49
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,280
 But yeah, creepiness is more like the potential to do harm, isn't it? Yeah, or actually, it's

50
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,080
 more like the ambiguity of whether someone might do you harm or might not do you harm.

51
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:16,080
 So yeah, maybe this is why, because I think this study also had the creepiest hobbies, what people

52
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,360
 found were the creepiest hobbies for people to have, and the top creepiest hobbies were collecting

53
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:29,200
 things, which I think that's, so the examples it gives are dolls insects and body parts.

54
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,520
 Well, I think the dolls insects, I'd be upset if I was loved in with body parts.

55
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:39,040
 It actually said that body parts such as teeth, bones or fingernails were considered

56
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:45,760
 especially creepy. So just a few more things from this study before we move on. They asked for creepy

57
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:52,000
 traits. What they did was they said, imagine a creepy person is talking to your friend, what traits

58
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,240
 might this creepy person have, and ones that they went for were the person stood too close to your

59
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:06,560
 friend. The person licked his or her lips frequently. Is that their own lips or the lips of your friend?

60
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:15,040
 And the person laughed at unpredictable times. I would put, sorry.

61
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:22,400
 I would put oscillating on there as well.

62
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,840
 It's oscillating as in kind of rocking. Yeah, just rocking. I find that a bit odd. I'll be in bookshops.

63
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,720
 There's always an older guy standing looking at a sort of the naughty section of a bookshop,

64
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,080
 you know, sort of like a romance erotica, and they oscillate. And I always say, don't go near an

65
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,280
 oscillating man. But is that more down to the position that he's in, as in he's in the in the sexy

66
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,520
 departments of the bookshop? Like if he was oscillating somewhere else in the bookshop,

67
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,920
 would it be less weird? Because actually like sexual predation is one of the things which

68
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:59,840
 people associate with creepiness of course. That is creepy. Did you guys see that on the list as well

69
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:06,480
 was bird watching, bird watches. It was quite unfair. And a guy who is a bird watcher

70
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:11,760
 wrote an article on his website called Aldobon. And he just wrote, he said, I'm just going to step away

71
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:16,080
 from my usual articles because I need to address this creepiness thing. And he said, here are a few

72
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,640
 of my thoughts. Number one, first of all, only squares. He's the term bird watching. It's birding.

73
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,080
 So that's a serious birder here. Yeah, he sounds like not a square. He sounds like he's a cool guy.

74
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,600
 And he says, and he says as well, like what they're not, what they're suggesting is that bird watches

75
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,200
 just stand there watching birds. It's not about that. It's about going to exotic locations. It's

76
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:38,160
 adventure. This man sounds misinformed because bird watching is not going to look for a rare bird

77
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,360
 that's twitching. That's the thing that the bird watching community gets quite annoyed about. So

78
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,960
 twitching are the people who are just in it for the excitement who they hear. There's been a

79
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,440
 weird parrot spotting in Cornwall and they get down there watching is sitting in your garden

80
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,760
 or in a forest all day, usually listening out for bird calls because you can't see. Well, he does say

81
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:58,800
 listening and thinking and anticipating. I can't wait for the letters after Anna said that this guy

82
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,280
 who writes a book. I know what I know on the website. On Audubon, which is the most famous bird watching

83
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,880
 website. Yeah, I think this is it's his site. He just to the final point. Number four is he says,

84
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,880
 you know, who I think the real creeps are here. These psychologists sitting around thinking about

85
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,840
 what's creepy all day, constantly asking people, do you think this is creepy? And how about this

86
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,840
 creepy? What a bunch of creeps. I think these scientists should get out of the lab a bit more.

87
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:28,240
 Maybe pick up a hobby. I know the perfect one. Slam, do you know who came up with the term the

88
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:34,080
 creeps? As in that gives me the creeps. Charles Dickens. David Copperfield, that's the first

89
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,920
 use that the Oxford dictionary has. Well, was it in reference to bird watches? It was not.

90
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:45,680
 And it also around that time mid-19th century creepiness was known as being clammy. That was

91
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:51,120
 another way of describing someone who was a creep. Oh, yeah, very clammy. Yeah. And so I think the reason

92
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,800
 just to explain why bird watching and it was bird watching and other hobbies that involve

93
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,760
 watching like the other examples given word, taking pictures of people watching children,

94
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:08,400
 pornography and bird watching. So you can't see why he was upset at being lumped in with those guys.

95
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:15,120
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. But this study, the study concludes by saying that creepy people are the

96
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:21,680
 personification of something called the prospect refuge theory, which is this idea that human seek places

97
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,560
 where you get refuge, so safety and you get prospect, so opportunity and basically what that

98
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,400
 means is places where you can hide easily, but you can see lots of other things around you potential

99
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:37,040
 threats. And I think maybe the idea of people who watch is that they're concealed. So a bird watcher

100
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,960
 is watching you, but often you can't see him if you're a bird. And that's why in like a Victorian

101
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,160
 house, we'd be creeped out because there are lots of nucks and crannies people could, you know,

102
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,960
 round corners that people could be hiding in. And if you're on a big open more land, people often find

103
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,840
 that a bit uncomfortable because there's no way you can hide. Sure. When I used to play laser quest,

104
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,400
 when I was a teenager, I used to like to hide in the corner so that no one could shoot me.

105
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:04,880
 Oh, you want to shoot them from where I was? Oh, does that make me creepy? Yes, and I also hate

106
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,680
 people who do that itself. Yeah, I know. Well, I was all with myself. Yeah, I played two weeks ago,

107
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:16,960
 laser quest. Wow, it was great fun. I'm afraid that's the extent of the fact. My fact this week,

108
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:22,960
 I'm back in the nine suits. Really good, it's great. So I think it was discovered by maybe Richard

109
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:28,080
 Wiseman did a study in the early 2000s and some of us before that that any area that has

110
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:33,040
 infrasound, any sound that's below 20 hertz, which is basically below the level of which humans can

111
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,680
 hear, makes us creeped out somehow, even though we don't know it. So he did this study in Edinburgh

112
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,160
 and he sent people to apparently haunted locations and to not haunted, but didn't tell them which were

113
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,640
 which. And they were more scared in the apparently haunted ones. And then he realised that's because

114
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,880
 there was this constant rumble. I think it was caused by the traffic, but it was just below that

115
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:56,800
 frequency at which we can hear. I'm sure this must be made up. I remember at school someone telling me

116
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,120
 that when Hitler did all of his speeches, what they used to do is before he came on, there was

117
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,520
 it was that kind of noise. So there was an unsettled feeling amongst everyone who was there for

118
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:10,080
 the speech. And then as soon as Hitler would come out, they would turn the sound off and the matching

119
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:14,400
 of the sense of calm from the sound disappearing with this person who you were there to see, it was like,

120
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:20,640
 ah, our leaders here kind of thing. Is that true at all? I've read that. I don't know if it's true. Do

121
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:29,280
 you think Theresa May is just getting to turn the machine off when she starts? Clowning was number one

122
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:35,040
 on the list of creepy occupations, right? Yeah. So the clowning community is very aware

123
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,600
 that they are being seen as creepy and they need to do something about it. So one of the things is that

124
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,360
 they teach people who are petrified of clowns not to be petrified by inviting them to come along and

125
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,480
 they give them clouncyling, they call it, and clouncyling sessions involve meeting the person,

126
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,880
 they then get done, they're made up done and stuff in front of them, and then you see them in the

127
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:01,040
 circus and you realize it's a normal person behind the clown face. Did you see this last few weeks

128
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,480
 in the news there have been some clown sightings in South Carolina? No, they're not native to South

129
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,200
 Carolina. That doesn't make any sense. What do you mean clown sightings? So they have been reported

130
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:17,600
 sightings of lurking creepy clowns that people have been telling the police about. Police in South

131
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:23,440
 Carolina have warned that anyone dressed as a clown could face a rest because so many people

132
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,800
 have been scared by these clowns. And at least one performer in Georgia has decided to inform

133
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:34,160
 police of his movements whenever in costume so that he doesn't get arrested. It's not, what's the

134
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,800
 what's the offense though? Because it's not an offense to be creepy. No, but there's reports of them

135
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:46,400
 kind of trying to get children into the woods. There you go. But here's the thing right, in 1981

136
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:52,720
 there was a very similar thing happening where people saw these clowns and they were supposedly

137
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,400
 kind of lowering children into woods and stuff like that. There was one one event where there was

138
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:03,520
 a clown who only had half his clown suit on and he was even more scary because he didn't have the bottom

139
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:10,480
 half on. He was naked from the waist down. But they had over 20 calls at this time and it was in

140
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,320
 the newspapers, but they found out that basically no adults had seen any of these clowns and they reckon

141
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,840
 that maybe it was just overactive imagination of kids and that was what caused it. Oh, okay. I'm scared

142
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:28,240
 of clowns again now. All that clownsling I had completely gone out there. Four years of clownsling.

143
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:34,880
 And actually these ones is South Carolina. At the moment I think no policemen has actually seen any

144
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,600
 of these clowns either. So they wonder if it also might be another kind of example of mass hysteria.

145
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,680
 That's another example of also a playground where it would be effectively what sounds like

146
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,680
 sexual predators out in the go. Those clowns, we'll get those clowns one day.

147
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:56,160
 I have one more creepy thing before we move on. Yeah sure. There was a news report about donations

148
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:01,920
 left to shelter Scotland homeless charity and they gave their weirdest and creepiest donations

149
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:09,840
 a mummified cat and a sack of creepy severed dolls heads with their eyelids glued shut.

150
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:16,720
 Yeah. That was donated to a charity. Don't let it do a charity. What possible use could you have

151
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,920
 in the charity shop? Sometimes the dolls heads fall off and you need a replacement. Well, I love

152
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,840
 these dolls heads but I'm afraid the eyes are just too open for me. No thanks.

153
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:39,280
 Okay, it's time for fact number two and that is my fact. My fact this week is that self-driving cars

154
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:45,200
 are playing grand theft auto in order to learn how to drive better. So this is

155
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,720
 scientists are basically teaching self-driving cars to identify stuff better and that's quite hard

156
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,040
 when you don't have a program that has things mapped out because you need it, you need to do it,

157
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,920
 you need to teach the algorithms to learn better to understand what every single potential thing

158
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,080
 you might encounter on the street is and they realize that instead of having to build all these

159
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:11,840
 programs that simulate a real life driving experience, why not use something that is extraordinarily

160
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:17,360
 detailed like grand theft auto and let it play it and let it just understand and start labeling

161
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,560
 all the things that you don't want to run over. There's this lab in Germany which has developed

162
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:29,600
 this. It's basically a software layer that sits in between the game and the car and the idea is

163
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,680
 that it's just automatically starts classifying all the things and feeding it into the algorithm.

164
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,880
 Do you think the game would be annoyed if it knew that it was being played by a not a human?

165
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,200
 What do you mean by that Addy? I don't know. I think you thought that was a more profound question

166
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:50,080
 than it actually was. It's interesting, you've got one virtual reality thing interacting with another.

167
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:54,960
 Yeah, it's pretty weird. So I read a list of how detailed grand theft auto is now.

168
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,320
 Some of the things that they've programmed into it if you were playing the game that you would

169
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:04,720
 notice. So if it begins raining puddles will slowly and realistically form in the road and if you

170
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,640
 shave your head or you have a clean shave your hair and stubble will grow at the same rate that

171
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:15,840
 say if it was mine, like they just calculated one person's growth. It's stuff like that they've really

172
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,760
 gone into it. But yours is quite fast growth. Yes, mine's a very fast growth. As if it was mine,

173
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:24,400
 it wouldn't be fast growth at all. So have they taken an average of everyone? No, I guess I guess

174
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:30,080
 they've just used one person's. It's the idea of hair growth. So it all... What are the cars going to

175
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,600
 do when they're put into real life and they come up against someone who doesn't have such fast

176
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,280
 growing hair? They're going to absolutely freak out. On the bright side people always get

177
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:44,640
 critical of grand theft also and kids playing it because it maybe teaches them to commit crimes,

178
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:50,000
 but it's quite safe for a car to play a game about stealing cars because a car has no incentive

179
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,600
 to steal a car. It's true, yeah. It's like teaching it about real life. This is what might happen to you.

180
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:01,360
 Yeah, it's a warning video. Yeah. There was, I read an article about someone who was in a

181
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,680
 Google self-driving car and they were saying that it's really interesting because the car uses a

182
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:12,160
 mixture of 3D laser mapping, GPS, radar and when they're using the radar, the radar goes through

183
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:18,880
 objects as opposed to just slapping onto something as it were. Like our eyes do. Yeah. When your eyes

184
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:27,040
 slap onto something. Yeah, but so as a result, there are moments when this person was in the car

185
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:33,600
 where the car would suddenly stop because it recognized a cyclist who was halted and they would

186
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,640
 have gone into it except for the fact that the cyclist was on the other side of a hedge. So it could

187
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,840
 see through the hedge to see a cyclist who was going head on the hedge. Big mist. What would it

188
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:52,080
 register that has? I don't think cars need to register a thick mist, do they? Pass a certain

189
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:59,440
 thickness, mist becomes fog. Okay, so a really heavy fog. I think my point stands. No fog has ever been

190
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:05,040
 so heavy to act as a wall against a car. So it would have to be what are you saying is that they

191
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:09,840
 don't use cameras. They use radar. Yeah. So it would have to be a fog thick enough to show on radar.

192
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,880
 Yeah. Okay. Like a fog of insects. Like sometimes if there's a load of insects kind of like mayflies

193
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,760
 all come at the same time. Right. They show up on radar. What about that, Anna? What about a plague

194
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:25,760
 of locusts or cicadas which is in the middle of the road? James, I don't know why you're trying to dig

195
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:31,360
 Andy out of this. It's very generous. Help me. Help me. I thought it was an extremely profound question.

196
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:40,640
 Google cars just had their first accident caused by a Google car rather than a person, I think.

197
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:46,800
 Fatality. No. No. I mean the smallest car accident you could possibly imagine. It was in February

198
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:51,440
 this year and it actually exposed something quite clever that I didn't realise they do which is they've

199
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,480
 trained Google cars to when you know when you're going along a main road and you need to turn right

200
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,120
 off the road and there's traffic coming the other way. So if you just stay in the middle of your lane

201
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,880
 then you hold up all the traffic behind you. So what you usually do is edge to the right hand side of

202
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,600
 your lane so that traffic can get around you and they've taught the Google cars to do that. So a

203
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,720
 Google car needed to turn right so edge to the right hand side of his lane but then spotted that

204
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,600
 I don't know why they've installed this in the area where they're training the cars but there's

205
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,640
 a bunch of sandbags blocking its route and so then indicated left to get back into the middle of the

206
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:28,480
 lane and it scraped up at two miles an hour against a bus that was coming on its left hand side so

207
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,520
 that was pretty dramatic. Was it in Britain this? No. I don't think it was. I think it was in America.

208
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,320
 So that would be turning left rather than right would it? It absolutely would be. I've said,

209
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:46,480
 so listen to what I just said and then swap round all the left and right and then you've got it.

210
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,040
 Have you seen the Rolls Royce one that they've developed? I'll put this up on Twitter but it's

211
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,480
 the photo on Twitter but it's worth you guys seeing right now. What's with what are you going to put it

212
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:00,560
 on? I'll put on QI podcast. This is a design that they're planning to actually release. Yeah, square

213
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:06,160
 wheels. It's a silver beast that looks like it's from the Jetsons. Isn't it? It's just listening

214
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,720
 to this. No, not on Twitter. It does not have square wheels. It's got sort of wheel guards on it.

215
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:16,560
 Yes. That's right. That's not just a car that's still mounted on its block. It looks like a

216
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:22,720
 monopoly piece, doesn't it? That's the best way to describe it. Is it real or is it a real car?

217
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,400
 No, no, it's a real car. Imagine if all the self-driving cars all look like different

218
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,680
 monopoly pieces. That'd be amazing. Oh my god, driving around it in old boots. Giant top hat,

219
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:38,240
 cruises past you. And what's the new one? They've introduced the car. It's the internet. You'd

220
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:44,240
 always swear at the cat, wouldn't you? Just new, fangled youth. Yeah, it's not gone down too well

221
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,600
 this car in terms of design. I like the design but they said in the article one reviewer, it's called

222
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,800
 the car, but ugly. And I think maybe a lot of people will agree, but I think there's a very skilled

223
00:20:54,800 --> 00:21:02,640
 reviewer. It's got a real way with words. Well, the point of driverless cars, I think, of the design,

224
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,280
 for instance, the Google's going for is to make them look incredibly friendly because we're quite

225
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,440
 very nervous about handing us our lives over to robots, even though that's not really justified,

226
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,760
 we are. And that looks like a very intimidating car. So I think they've gone entirely the wrong

227
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,360
 direction. So that the Google cars, if you look at them, they've sort of made a face on the front

228
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,040
 of them. Yeah. Like a friendly face, the lights are a pair of eyes and then below the bumper,

229
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:28,320
 it's like a smiling now. Saps, they must take us for the these killer robots are smiling.

230
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,960
 Against true though, because you know the new London red buses, to me, they look like they're

231
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,640
 pissed off with me. Anytime I see one from the front of mine, that bus is angry with me. That's the

232
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:44,640
 drivers. And it's because you keep standing in front of them. So there was an interview with a guy

233
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,920
 called Barry Kirk, who was an expert from the Canadian automated vehicle centre of excellence.

234
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:54,880
 And he was very worried that people would start having sex in driverless cars because you're not

235
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,440
 driving. So what are you going to do? Like whenever I'm not driving, I'm always having sex.

236
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:08,080
 That's why the driving to sex driving away from sex or having sex or driving people away from sex.

237
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:14,720
 He was saying, yeah, he's reckoned that people will be in cars and they'll not be driving and they'll

238
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,240
 be like, well, what are we going to do? So we'll have sex. And he thinks that's going to be a problem

239
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,920
 because... All right, Mum. Every school run.

240
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:33,440
 But yeah, he thinks that this is a problem because when the humans have to kind of take over because

241
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,720
 something goes wrong, they'll be... They'll be having sex. Right. I'll be playing a board game.

242
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:51,440
 I'll be neatly folding a cardigan. And his post sex ritual. That's at this chat-up-like nice cardigan.

243
00:22:51,440 --> 00:23:00,320
 I'll be folding that later. You know what, your cardigan would look good. Fold it up in a draw.

244
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:09,200
 Do you guys know how old driverless cars are when they date back to? Five years.

245
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,240
 Thanks. That's really sweet of you to do that because it's actually much longer ago than that.

246
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,480
 It's going to make my fact sound even better. Five thousand years. You do get it.

247
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:26,560
 No, so the earliest driverless cars date back to the 1920s. And actually, you'll see various

248
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:31,280
 articles refer to the earliest one as being called the Linrican Wonder, which was made in 1926.

249
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,600
 And it was radio controlled. And so there was someone driving in a car behind it who had a radio

250
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,680
 connection to the car in front. Then I looked, I searched in the British newspaper archive for this.

251
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:45,440
 And there's actually an earlier one that it referenced in 1921. So this was in Ohio. And again,

252
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,440
 it was the same idea. It was invented by this guy called Captain Vaughn, who drove another car,

253
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,720
 17 yards behind it and controlled it with a little remote control. Oh, wow. And the article

254
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,360
 said to the surprise and dismay of passes by, it made its way through the main streets,

255
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,840
 obeying the traffic signals, taking the turns and blowing its own horn at careless pedestrians.

256
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,080
 So you could also have an automated horn as well. Some things on Grand Theft Auto?

257
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:15,120
 Yeah, sure. So if you, you can get your character on Grand Theft Auto, look at the smartphone and

258
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:21,040
 open some websites. And Grand Theft Auto has more websites than North Korea.

259
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:30,480
 Wow. There are 83 sites available on the game. And there are 28 sites in the whole of the North

260
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:37,200
 Korean intra web. Wow. That they're allowed to go. The guy who voices a character called Michael

261
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,640
 in Grand Theft Auto, a guy called Ned Luke, he put on 25 pounds for the role.

262
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:49,440
 For the voice role. Wow. He's a method actor. And he said he wanted to really get into the

263
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,640
 physicality of this role. Put on some weight, dedication. That's amazing. That's incredible.

264
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:02,320
 If you complete the game, having found every peyote location, this is Grand Theft Auto 5,

265
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:07,440
 and complete the mission, the last one, without killing the Sasquatch first.

266
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:15,120
 And then you play another go of the game as Franklin on a Tuesday between 530 and 830, while the

267
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:23,920
 weather is foggy, then you can play as a bigfoot. That's awesome. That's so cool. There must be

268
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:29,920
 videos of that on YouTube. Probably. For a long time, it was a conspiracy theory

269
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:34,000
 between Grand Theft Auto players that you would be able to do this, but no one knew how to do it,

270
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,480
 and then someone just found out how to do it. You're describing that, knowing that you've never

271
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,880
 played it, and neither have I. It was kind of like listening to Grandparents talk about the internet,

272
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,960
 like yesterday, when my friend's mom asked me to send her an app of the show that I do.

273
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,840
 Yeah, just hearing you trying to pronounce all the words in Grand Theft also.

274
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,360
 Most of those words were perfectly normal, English words. You're just sounded not comfortable doing it.

275
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:11,520
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy. My fact is that Cucumber is a born with a

276
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:17,040
 hook in their upper beak, which is specifically for murdering their siblings. We all have that.

277
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:25,200
 Okay, that was creepy. So this is what's known, technically, as a morphological specialisation

278
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,080
 for sibling rivalry. So it's basically like having an arm just for hitting your brother with actually

279
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:36,480
 with my brother, that was his old arm. Well, are you stabbing yourself in the beak?

280
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:44,800
 Yeah, so Cucumber is, they have this thing where they always lay three eggs, and they hatch out at

281
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:51,840
 separate times. And in about half of Cucumber breads, the youngest one to hatch is killed by the siblings.

282
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:58,240
 And the siblings, they pick it to death normally, or they push it out of the nest, and it just helps

283
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:04,160
 the other two get to a larger weight when they fly the nest, which allows them to be more successful

284
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:08,800
 breeding later on. And it's basically done as an insurance policy by the parents, because

285
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:14,640
 there is a chance that one of the first two will die, and that will limit your reproductive success.

286
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:20,560
 So as a result, you have the third one just in case, but normally it's clear that it won't be

287
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:24,320
 required. So it's really fruitful. There are substitutes. It's like being on the bench,

288
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,440
 except at the end of the match, you don't celebrate with the team, you get killed by them.

289
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:37,520
 There's a few birds that do this, actually. Honeyguides, they do this. And one of the children will

290
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:42,800
 peck the other one blindly before it's even opened its eyes. So it's just been born still blind,

291
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:47,760
 and it just kind of blindly pecks around until it hits its brother or sister and then just murders them.

292
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:53,360
 And is it as it definitely know what it's doing, or is it kind of just like I've just been born,

293
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,400
 I'm just feeling around. It is not just birds ever know what they're doing.

294
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:04,560
 It's not an accident. I mean, I think you can really defend the accidental repeated killing

295
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:09,200
 of your siblings, just saying you were flailing around. Yeah, definitely. I wouldn't say it's an accident.

296
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,800
 Okay, so they mean nice. So for instance, black Eagles do this as well. And once they were studying

297
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:21,840
 them and they found that one of the larger eglets pecked the smaller one, 1,569 times before it died.

298
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:28,400
 So you couldn't really call that an accident. Right. There is a thing about Eagles. This is bold

299
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:34,800
 Eagles, I think, but it's really interesting. So they have, again, three checks. And the first two to

300
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:39,840
 hatch, they have this massive dose of testosterone in the egg yolk. And there's a scientist from the

301
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,320
 University of Oklahoma called Douglas Mark, who said, I think this is brilliant. The yolk is like a

302
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:49,680
 bagged lunch that the kid takes to school. You can either give your kid a lunch packed with steroids,

303
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:54,960
 so he'll be abrooted by recess, or you can give him peanut butter. And so the third, the third one

304
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,680
 born doesn't have the huge mega dose of testosterone. You'd be called in by the teachers, saying your

305
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:05,360
 son's lunch box today was a bit the youngest with the peanut butter. That's fine, but old steroids.

306
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:12,560
 That's not an acceptable lunch. So this is also cruel about it. Is the parents sort of deliberately

307
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:16,400
 set the situation up? And sometimes the kids will be fighting and the parent knows which is the

308
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:21,280
 weakest, the one which needs to die, and will hold that one down so that the others can get at it.

309
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:27,520
 It's a really bad example to be setting your children, I think. Yeah, it is. Do you know

310
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:33,040
 otherwise what about kookaburras? Is that the female who gives birth can controls the timing of when

311
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:38,080
 she lays the eggs, and that's part of her strategy. So by timing them so that the eggs hatch at different

312
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,240
 times, it means that they're slightly different sizes the kids, so it sets up some to be able to beat

313
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,600
 the others. But also the first egg that she lays is male, and the second egg is female. So the first

314
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:53,280
 egg to hatch is male, second is female, and the third is 50/50. You could go either way. Lucky dip. Yeah.

315
00:29:53,280 --> 00:30:00,080
 Wow. And that's strange. You know kookaburras used to be called the ha ha pigeon. Isn't that the best

316
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,680
 nickname? I thought they were called lapping jack asses. They get called that, they have a lot of

317
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:09,680
 names. Yeah. The breakfast bird, because they have this really loud laugh, and it sounds like

318
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:14,560
 they got called the settlers clock. Well hang on, hang on. Why, you started explaining why they're

319
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,240
 they're called breakfast and they have a laugh.

320
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:16,240
 - Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

321
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:36,360
 You do have to finish these sentences.

322
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,520
 I think Ha Ha pigeons the best though.

323
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:43,200
 There's a very famous Aussie song that we used to sing as kids, Cookebosits on the

324
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,440
 old gum tree, very classic song.

325
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,160
 And I was reading about that song because obviously it is very famous and I googled it and

326
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:55,760
 what came up was that there's an Aussie show called Spix and Specs, ages ago this happened,

327
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,880
 Adam Hills was the host and it's like never mind the buzz cocks of Australia.

328
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:05,680
 One of the questions was which song, which famous song has Cookebosits on the old gum

329
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:10,480
 tree in it and the answer was "Men at Works" "I come from a land down under."

330
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,880
 Now no one had made that connection before and so the people who own the rights to the

331
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:22,640
 song Cookebosits on the old gum tree got in touch, sued men at work and won and $4.5 million

332
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:28,040
 roughly in that region after years and years of them having to battle it out in court got

333
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:32,280
 handed over and they lost the case and they proved that there were two flute moments in

334
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:36,760
 it that copied the lines from this song which was written by an Aussie school teacher and

335
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,560
 then handed over to a library.

336
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:47,840
 That's I bet they felt bad to ever set that question, yeah, I know, it would have been Adam

337
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,040
 Hills I imagine, yeah.

338
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:55,560
 Just a headline I found which was sausage-redicted Cookebara "too fat to fly" I thought I'd

339
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,560
 share that with you.

340
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,240
 And yet you didn't read the full article which I did.

341
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,200
 Oh I did, well yeah.

342
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,200
 We all read the article.

343
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,200
 So we've done.

344
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,600
 Some links you just can't not click, she was a Cookebara and she became very fat but from

345
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,600
 sausage handouts.

346
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,680
 It's the article said.

347
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:15,600
 The article really is kind of summed up quite well in the headline there is nothing to do.

348
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,560
 Yeah reading was quite disappointing, there was very little more to be gained.

349
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:21,200
 Well it gets attacked by dogs at one point and then people notice it.

350
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,880
 It's because they smell like sausages.

351
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:29,280
 And someone thought oh no the poor thing it must have broken its wing and been able

352
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:34,520
 to protect itself from the dogs and it's just been eating sausages so it can't fly away.

353
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,520
 Did you read that thing?

354
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,520
 Someone sent this to us.

355
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:40,440
 So I think Mark Abrams had retweeted it, Mark Abrams of the ignoble prize had retweeted

356
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:44,520
 it and it was from Errol Flynn's autobiography.

357
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,400
 I saw the tweet but I didn't read it yet.

358
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,520
 Okay so what did you read Andy?

359
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:53,600
 It's basically he suddenly says it is autobiography that he started experimenting on ducks.

360
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,720
 He's like I did a lot of scientific experiments on ducks and he had read that if you gave ducks

361
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,720
 a bit of pork.

362
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,600
 So I'm just going off Cookebara's eating sausages.

363
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:06,360
 If you gave ducks a bit of pork it immediately goes through those systems within like two

364
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,520
 to three minutes they put it out on the other side.

365
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:12,720
 So he had a thought of what if I tied a bit of string to the pork and let it go through

366
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:18,280
 the duck and he did and so it went through and then he gave another bit of pork to another

367
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,680
 duck and another duck and he basically created a string of ducks.

368
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,680
 A duck centipede.

369
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,680
 A human centipede.

370
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:29,520
 Exactly duck centipede and he used to charge people to come and see his scientific experiments

371
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,480
 and people would come and watch duck centipede.

372
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,480
 This is awful.

373
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:37,080
 It's in his autobiography, it's got centipede around on Twitter.

374
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,800
 There are some plants which engage in cyblicide.

375
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,800
 Really?

376
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,800
 Yeah.

377
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,800
 Wow.

378
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:46,520
 So there's a tree in India called the Delbergier or Delbergier tree and it makes all these

379
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,760
 flat pods full of seeds and the seeds get dispersed by the wind.

380
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,960
 It gets spread around so you get more trees elsewhere.

381
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,840
 In the seed pod the very first seed to develop produces these chemicals which gas all the

382
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,240
 other seeds in the pod.

383
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,240
 Wow.

384
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,400
 And it means that it is much like clear to be the one which survives.

385
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,400
 It's not crazy.

386
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,880
 A very clever one.

387
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:17,320
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is Anachazinski.

388
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:23,760
 My fact is that the first ever mention of paper recommended it as a cure for frizzy hair.

389
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,680
 How does this cure work?

390
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,680
 Great question.

391
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,680
 Well I don't think it does.

392
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:28,680
 Oh.

393
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,680
 Is that one?

394
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,680
 Sorry James.

395
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:36,400
 I read this in a book called Paper Trail by a guy called Alexander Monroe which is such a

396
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,400
 good book.

397
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,400
 Really readable.

398
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,480
 Really interesting.

399
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:45,000
 And he cited this bamboo document which was found in a Chinese tomb in 217 BC and that

400
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,280
 document uses the Chinese for paper in it for the first time.

401
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:56,000
 But the context in which it uses it is it says if a man's hair without reason stands erect

402
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,680
 like worms, whiskers or eyebrows.

403
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:07,000
 Yeah, I know, I don't maybe worms with different back then.

404
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,200
 If a man stands erect like a worms whiskers or eyebrows, he would have encountered a bad

405
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:16,440
 spirit to resolve this boiler hemp shoe with paper and the evil will be dismissed.

406
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,880
 That's when paper paper first came into our lives, he has been boiled with a shoe.

407
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,880
 Wow.

408
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,880
 Amazing.

409
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,840
 So this is the word it's g, is that how you pronounce it?

410
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,840
 True.

411
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,840
 Yeah.

412
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,840
 Yeah, is that H.I.

413
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,840
 True.

414
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,840
 Okay.

415
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:37,200
 And I'm also reading a book about paper at the moment by Mark Kolanski and he has another

416
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:42,640
 time when they use this word very early, it was in 93 BC and it wasn't when a guard advised

417
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,480
 a prince to hide his deformed nose with a piece of paper.

418
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,480
 Did he draw a more perfect nose on the bit of paper and just hold it up?

419
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,480
 Didn't save it.

420
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,480
 That would make sense.

421
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,400
 I like when they do scaffolding on buildings and they put on the outside of the scaffolding

422
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,400
 what the new building is going to look like.

423
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,400
 Yeah, exactly.

424
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,400
 Yeah.

425
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,400
 For a nose.

426
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,400
 That's what I clever.

427
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,920
 My mom said when she was a kid, the queen was once visiting the area, she grew up in a Manchester

428
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,560
 and their line of terraced houses, they decided the cows upside looked a bit skanky and so

429
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,560
 they put covers on all of their houses, they stopped all in covers so the queen would think

430
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,560
 they were nicer.

431
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,560
 Well.

432
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,560
 Yeah.

433
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,560
 That's amazing.

434
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,560
 Yeah.

435
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,560
 How weird.

436
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,560
 Like a Potemkin village kind of thing.

437
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,560
 Yeah, exactly.

438
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,560
 Yeah.

439
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,560
 Yeah.

440
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,560
 They might as well have just not taken it to Manchester.

441
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,760
 They might just take it apart.

442
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,120
 Take it to Bab and say, "Oh, this is Manchester."

443
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,720
 "Oh, it looks a lot like Bath."

444
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,720
 Oh, no.

445
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,720
 So paper in China.

446
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,960
 There's a thing in China, it's a sort of tomb sweeping day basically.

447
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,360
 It happens every year and you take paper money, fake paper money to burn at your ancestors

448
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,360
 great.

449
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,360
 Yeah, I used to go and do that.

450
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,360
 Did you?

451
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,360
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

452
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,360
 And so is it stacks of...

453
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,360
 I didn't have any ancestors myself, so I just had to use other people's ancestors.

454
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,360
 Did you?

455
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,360
 Yeah, yeah, honestly.

456
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,360
 It was a thing.

457
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,360
 It was a big day, though, in Hong Kong.

458
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,880
 Yeah, so you buy them a monopoly money and you burn that.

459
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,920
 It's money for the dead.

460
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:01,480
 It's a specific currency for the afterlife and you burn it by the grave and it's...

461
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:04,000
 Did the other people not mind that you were doing it for their ancestors?

462
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,360
 Oh, I went with friends.

463
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:10,600
 And also, there's a lot of grave yards where it's kind of unmarked tombstones and stuff,

464
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,760
 belonging to the Prophet God in person.

465
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,960
 Yeah, was it only money that you were burning then?

466
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,320
 No, because in Taiwan, is this what you're going to say?

467
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:23,400
 We've now started burning cardboard iPads for their ancestors so that they can have them

468
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,920
 in the other world.

469
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:30,320
 You get helicopters and whole models of houses and plastic servants, you get, you burn

470
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,320
 a plastic servant.

471
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,320
 So they do that.

472
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,400
 They do that largely for funerals as well in China and Taiwan, Hong Kong.

473
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,840
 What they do is they build replicas of the things that you had in life and maybe give it

474
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,760
 a bit of an extension so that you can bring it into the afterlife.

475
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,920
 So I've seen it go by.

476
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,920
 You see these huge.

477
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:50,400
 It's like giant pinata kind of things and they bring it, yeah, to all the cremations and

478
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,400
 so on.

479
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,400
 It's amazing.

480
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,400
 That's so cool.

481
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,720
 Yeah, do is that you get that in the next life, is it?

482
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,720
 Yes.

483
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,720
 Yeah.

484
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:01,120
 So they will make exactly servants and little, little, you know, Cadillac cars and all

485
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,120
 that sort of stuff.

486
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,120
 That's amazing.

487
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,120
 Yeah.

488
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:07,360
 So about the history of paper.

489
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:12,760
 The fact that we have paper now, a lot of it is thanks to Buddhists.

490
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:18,360
 So when they first started making paper, a lot of it was used for kind of holy books, but

491
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:22,800
 if you think about it, a Jewish book like the Torah would be just read over and over again

492
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,280
 the same book.

493
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:27,520
 If you look in an old Torah, it's like really well worn.

494
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,240
 It will be well read.

495
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,000
 Christian books would only be read by monks.

496
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,680
 So they don't really need that many of those and the Koran you would just memorize, so

497
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,440
 you don't really need many of those.

498
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:42,000
 But in Buddhism, you kind of helps you to reach enlightenment that helps you if you just

499
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,800
 copy things out lots and lots of times and in order to do that, it's better to have a cheap

500
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,400
 writing material and that's where paper came in or one of the reasons why it proliferated

501
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,400
 so much in the early days.

502
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,400
 Very interesting.

503
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,400
 Oh, that's so cool.

504
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:59,800
 And we should say we're talking about tree-based paper because you've got papyrus, sorry, tree

505
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:04,520
 or rags here because you've got papyrus which is earlier and is made of reeds basically

506
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,400
 and you've got loads of other styles.

507
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:12,560
 And actually, when he says tree or rags, this definition of paper that Munro uses isn't

508
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,560
 rags.

509
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:18,600
 He says specifically that paper needs to be plant-based and it needs to be properly pulped.

510
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,840
 So it can't even be plant-based and sort of flattened out.

511
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,560
 Paper for him is pulped, plant-based.

512
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,560
 So that's what the paper in my original fact refers to.

513
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,560
 Okay.

514
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,760
 The bizarre thing about the invention of paper which happened probably in like 100 or 200

515
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:37,680
 BC is what you're doing is you're taking bits of plant material.

516
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:42,400
 You're mushing it down so you release all the cellulose which is inside it and then you're

517
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:47,320
 adding water and spreading it out and then the cellulose meshes together and becomes paper.

518
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,900
 But no one discovered cellulose until 1838.

519
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:54,360
 So how do you come up with this idea of making paper?

520
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,360
 It doesn't make any sense.

521
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,360
 That's cool.

522
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,360
 Because yeah, that's it.

523
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:01,960
 It's all these very, very long fibers that you get and it's better if you boil down your

524
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,840
 tree pulp rather than chopping it up.

525
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,840
 Yeah, yeah.

526
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,840
 In the shortness of the fibers loads.

527
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:11,120
 It was very popular for making kites in China, ancient China and there was a fifth-century

528
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:15,520
 Chinese emperor who ordered that people should be executed by attaching them to kites and

529
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:20,520
 having them fly away, which I don't think would have worked in reality but that's what he

530
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,520
 instructed.

531
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,520
 Ah.

532
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,520
 Yeah, nice.

533
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,520
 What a way to go.

534
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,880
 Quite a nice way to go, I suppose.

535
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,480
 Everyone's singing "Let's Go Fly a Kites" as you are.

536
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:33,560
 That would have been a morbid ending to Mary Poppins.

537
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:39,320
 Actually, one of my favourite things about paper has always been that paper was invented

538
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:45,160
 by wasps long, long before it was invented by humans and actually wasps taught us how to

539
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,160
 make paper.

540
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:50,720
 OK, are you reading my notes?

541
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,720
 You have to explain this.

542
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,600
 Do you mean white Anglo-Saxon Protestants?

543
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,840
 No.

544
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:02,160
 I wasps that make their nest out of paper essentially and they do it by chewing up wood and pulping

545
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,280
 it like we do and then exuding it in the same process.

546
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,000
 Wait a minute, we don't chew up the wood to make paper.

547
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
 Oh, is that not how you've done what my notes were?

548
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,800
 That's why they're a bit damp.

549
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,800
 But it's kind of it was.

550
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,800
 So it's the same process basically.

551
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,600
 It's exactly the same process and in fact, when I say they taught us how to make paper,

552
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,520
 they taught us in the west how to make paper because we were thousands of years behind

553
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,320
 the Chinese in this.

554
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:29,720
 So this was in the 18th century a French scientist called Rene Roumure in 1719 saw observe these

555
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:35,880
 wasps making paper nests and he wrote down in a book saying, I think we could use this.

556
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,200
 We could make paper like this as well.

557
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,840
 This seems like a really good thing to do, but never actually tries it.

558
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:45,160
 And then I think about 50 years later a guy called Jacob Schaffer read his book and thought,

559
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,160
 yeah, good idea.

560
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,160
 I'll give it a go.

561
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,160
 And he made paper that way.

562
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:53,480
 I definitely had paper before that, though, because the Mars brought it over to Spain in the 11th

563
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,480
 century or so.

564
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,480
 Yeah, that's what I thought.

565
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:59,880
 So I wonder if it is exactly the same process or if it's, I think it might be a different

566
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,880
 moment process.

567
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:05,880
 The amazing thing is that wasps do not, to this day, know what cellulosis is, incredibly.

568
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,880
 They retain the capacity to make paper.

569
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,800
 Do you think we're going to be the equivalent of speaks and specs here where a wasp is going

570
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:16,960
 to be listening to our show, realizing the amount of money they're owed for this invention?

571
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:24,000
 So for rag-based paper, cotton-based paper, they needed ammonia to make it.

572
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,200
 And so you would get rag men in lots of large cities going door to door saying, do you have

573
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,200
 any spare urine?

574
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,200
 Yeah.

575
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,200
 That was the thing.

576
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,160
 And people almost always do if you wait long enough.

577
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:42,920
 In fact, I would say that all urine I produce is spare.

578
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:47,800
 And that is treachery in all the old paper mills. It wasn't just the ammonia of the urine.

579
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,000
 They would make the paper out of old rags.

580
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,720
 And that would come from like soiled clothing.

581
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:58,040
 And so you would go to a paper mill and it would be the smells of soiled underwear and stuff

582
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,800
 and the smell of urine.

583
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,280
 And that's basically what it would be like.

584
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,280
 Wow.

585
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,280
 Great news.

586
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,280
 I've just shacked wet myself.

587
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:08,240
 I'm a paper magnate.

588
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,280
 Ooh, what's toilet paper made out of?

589
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:17,560
 I was going to say, but if you've pissed yourself, is that then going into, is it like a secure,

590
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,560
 there are two kinds of blue paper.

591
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:25,440
 So there's what they call virgin blue paper, which is made of tree pulp that has never been

592
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,440
 used for anything before.

593
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,520
 It's only been turned into blue paper.

594
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:32,520
 And does that have Richard Branson's face on it?

595
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:41,120
 And Jeremy Cobb in sat in the toilet, but there's no way for me to sit in here.

596
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:45,600
 So the other kind is recycled blue paper, which is not recycled blue paper, it's recycled

597
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:46,600
 things like office paper.

598
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,600
 Yeah.

599
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:51,120
 The other thing about these paper mills is at night time they would close them because they're

600
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,120
 really noisy.

601
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:57,040
 But then often they, you know, if they're in a big order, they go all night and everyone

602
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,040
 would complain.

603
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,240
 But they close them at night.

604
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:03,800
 And then children would crawl around the machinery cleaning their little bits and pieces.

605
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:09,240
 And then in the morning they would get hauled out, dried with rough cloths, spanked to remove

606
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:13,840
 numbness from their skin, give it a large glass of wine and set to bed.

607
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:17,240
 That's the life of a paper billboard.

608
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,240
 Wow.

609
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,240
 Wow.

610
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,240
 Sounds sort of fun.

611
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,240
 Yeah.

612
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,240
 It's spanking in wine.

613
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,240
 It sounds like 50 shades of gray.

614
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:31,240
 Okay.

615
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,240
 That's it.

616
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,240
 That's all of our facts.

617
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,240
 Thank you so much for listening.

618
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,400

 Or you can go to our group account which is @QIPodcast or go to our website.

624
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:57,000
 No such thing as a fish.com where we have all of our previous episodes and no such thing

625
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,760
 as the news.com which has all of our previous TV show episodes.

626
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:03,200
 We will be back again next week with another podcast.

627
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,200
 We'll see you then.

628
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,200
 Goodbye.
