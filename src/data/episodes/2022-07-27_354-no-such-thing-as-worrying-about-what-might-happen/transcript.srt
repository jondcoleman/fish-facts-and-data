14
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:34,000
 Happy New Year on with a podcast

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:42,640
 hey guys you've got a quick quiz question if the date is Wednesday the 31st of December

16
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:50,960
 are you in the last week of the year yes yes that is incorrect you're in the first week of the year

17
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,320
 so I'm afraid you're all have to leave what could not be in both no of course you can't be in both

18
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,320
 what do you mean it's Wednesday the 31st of December you're in the last no but the week's

19
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,800
 different isn't it because it's it's more heavy set on the other side of the week in days if it

20
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:10,960
 was on a scale it would weigh over to the the new year week wouldn't it dan's describing better what

21
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:16,880
 the international organization for standardization describes in terms of how to refer to weeks so

22
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,360
 you know across the world we have to have the same definition of week one week two week three of a

23
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:28,480
 year and the week week I gotta say I'm without the other side look the week week's up to start on a

24
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,960
 Monday and we've got to have the same week so that trading and business internationally globally

25
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,600
 works so there's an international body that decides what week one is and the definition of

26
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,800
 week one of the year is the week with the year's first Thursday in it so if the first of January

27
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,240
 is a Thursday then week one actually starts on the 29th of December which is that Monday right so

28
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:53,840
 week one is that so if the 31st of December is on a Wednesday then you're actually in week one

29
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,560
 of the next year because that's insane you can't have week one beginning two days before the year

30
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,960
 ends I'm sorry it's absolutely no one does things in weeks anyway you do things in quarters

31
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:09,440
 when it happens like that Anna always has her New Year's party on Sunday the 28th of December don't

32
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:16,320
 it's an absolutely banging event with me me and my cat in attendance I'm sorry you guys have never

33
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:22,000
 been able to make it just very quickly what number Archbishop of Paris do you reckon André

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:30,400
 Ventois is is is he the current 23rd 22nd as far as I can tell he's the 30th

35
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:39,440
 so that's his actual name André Ventois and he yeah he was born with the surname 23 and the

36
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:46,080
 the best guess is that it was because and a sort of ancestor of his was found and adopted and they

37
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,000
 were found on the 23rd of a month and so they were given that surname yeah so but as far as I can

38
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,560
 tell he's the 30th there's there's a lot of breaks in their archbishops over the years so there might

39
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:05,440
 be a few that are not in there hey what's Archbishop Ventois favourite band I don't know Andy what is

40
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:13,360
 Archbishop Ventois favourite band Eiffel 65 and it's because they have a French name and then a

41
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:20,960
 number oh really what well Eiffel Eiffel no no I do understand that yeah and he's French and he

42
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:27,520
 has a number in his name you know what their favourite punk band is I don't know it's Blink 182

43
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,080
 and that's because French people blink like the rest of us and there's a there's a number following

44
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:39,360
 that I really think we should move this on I've got to get out of here what is Archbishop Ventois

45
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:49,840
 favourite album by Adele there's a few options there 21 because he's called 23 and it's just another

46
00:04:49,840 --> 00:05:00,160
 number yeah yes very interesting he prepares it to the original 19 yeah are all of Adele's albums

47
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:07,920
 numbered yeah oh mate yes yeah 19 that is the age she was when actually it's actually not the ages

48
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,160
 anymore they've become untethered from her age but yeah I thought I was thinking she can't have

49
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:26,880
 released 23 albums okay there's an Indian loser called Shiva Keshavan and he has been a true victim

50
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:33,600
 of the Indian government's low prioritising of various olympic sports he it's you can understand

51
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,440
 why the Indian government isn't prioritising the loot look no think about the Himalayas think about

52
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,160
 the pre low territory you've got for looting I was just thinking that Sean Connery would be a good

53
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:52,560
 luge manager like coach because he'd be like you're a looser you're a looser and all the SH's Sean

54
00:05:52,560 --> 00:06:01,040
 Connery's both got Shiva Keshavan you're a looser but so he had to train on wheels not in a proper

55
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:06,880
 looge thing because that's normally on ice isn't it the looge he had to make a sled basically with

56
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,920
 wheels on and just train on busy roads just going downhill in the Himalayas and he had there's

57
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,080
 there's footage of him dodging a herd of goats which is in the middle of the road and he has

58
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:22,240
 sort of frantically looge around you know um old mcdonald had a farm very well did you got familiar

59
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:32,160
 yeah yeah eio well the earliest version we have was actually old mcdoogle had a farm eio and there's

60
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:39,760
 an even earlier version which is not about a farm but it's old Missouri had a mule he high he high

61
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:46,880
 ho and every country around the world has its own version of old mcdonald and they're all on

62
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:56,640
 wikipedia of course so in turkish it's Ali Baba has a farm eio in swedish it's Per Olson has a farm

63
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:06,800
 eio and in Serbian it's svakoyutro jedno jaje organismus nagudaje which means

64
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:16,320
 one egg a day gives the strength to human organism wow they've just gone completely random i don't

65
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:21,440
 understand that at all every other country in the world it's about someone having a farm and they're

66
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,560
 just like don't eat your eggs when planes are actually just coming into land as a normal procedure

67
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,280
 the way it works is that they have to get ready miles before they even see where the airport is

68
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,680
 they got to get to a certain height and then there's a couple of things that they have to either see

69
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,760
 they've got to either have eyes on the runway or the lights that they can see coming from it to

70
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:45,280
 know that they're at the right height and it's actually the computer on board the airline that

71
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,520
 makes them make a snap decision about whether or not they were able to land or if they're at the

72
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,800
 wrong bit so as they're getting ready to that moment the computer will just yell out in the cockpit

73
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:02,480
 decide that's all they get she goes decide and then they go yes we're doing it or they have to pull

74
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:12,240
 out it sounds like a tv quiz show and now it's time to decide oh you would have won a speedboat but

75
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:20,720
 you've died in a blink that's amazing do they get warning is there a sort of i'm gonna have to

76
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,280
 have to hurry you here your time to think i hope you've made up your mind because in a minute

77
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:31,840
 you're going to have to decide and then if they go for it it goes oh interesting decision

78
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,800
 we'll come back after the break to see if you've made the right call

79
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:43,600
 there is a problem with being in the center of america someone found out there's this massive

80
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:49,600
 problem that was generated for someone who lives quite near the center of the us in fact

81
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,480
 and this is to do with a company called maxmind have you read about this story about ip addresses

82
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:00,320
 okay so it's so weird basically uh maxmind is this company who about sort of just over 10 years ago

83
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,040
 started calculating the location of loads of ip addresses so you know with your computer you've

84
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,600
 got an ip address maxmind figured out whereabouts they all were geographically and then it could

85
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,800
 sell that information to companies like google and facebook and lots of other people um but often

86
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,800
 when you're trying to work out where an ip address is you can't get it exact and sometimes it'll just

87
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,400
 say this is somewhere in america or somewhere in the us and so for all of those maxmind just

88
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:29,200
 default assumed that they were in the middle so they got the coordinates of roughly the middle

89
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:35,120
 of america and said okay all the ip addresses that we can't quite place they just are here

90
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:41,280
 and it turns out here is a rural farmhouse belonging to someone called joce taylor who now

91
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:48,240
 has 600 million ip addresses registered to her farmhouse and it's it's a complete disaster because

92
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,440
 basically if there's a troll online or if there's someone who's hacked your company or if there's

93
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,520
 someone doing criminal activity online and the police are tracking them down they chase up their

94
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:02,800
 ip address and they constantly find it's at joce taylor's farmhouse and she's just inundated with

95
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,160
 kind of abuse and people writing her threatening letters and had no idea why for about eight years

96
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,720
 she was just like why am i being oh no what's happening to me are we definitely journalist

97
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,280
 tracked her down are we definitely discounting the fact that joce is like a massive cyber

98
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:24,160
 criminal is that she's she's a criminal mastermind an 82 year old criminal mastermind it's possible

99
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:33,440
 that's funny oh poor joce choice and apparently the verne scholars refer to the novel as around

100
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:40,880
 the world in 80 days and the play as around the world in 80 days but with 80 the digits so that's

101
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:46,240
 how you can tell the difference be honest i didn't get that from when you were reading it out i saw

102
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,680
 the fatal flaw in transferring this visual thing in front of me to the audio medium really we're

103
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,400
 really hoping you're going to say around the world in 80 plays was what they called the play he wasn't

104
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:03,920
 that smart a guy you know people claim he was you know you know mitten crabs is if you catch one

105
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:10,000
 is there always a string attached to another mitten crab on the other hand uh the cia they

106
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,640
 collected a load of jokes in the selviet union in the 80s that was one of the things they did and

107
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,280
 that got declassified quite recently um we're not quite sure why they did it but it might have been

108
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:24,640
 a way to kind of gauge what people were thinking in the selviet union or maybe a way of undermining

109
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:30,480
 the government or stuff so they found stuff like um there are two men waiting in a line to buy vodka

110
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,600
 the first man says i've had enough save my place i'm going to shoot gorbachev two hours later he

111
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,080
 returns to claim his place in the line his friend said did you get him and the man replies no the

112
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:46,000
 line there was even longer than the line here that's a good joke it's not bad is it a man goes into a

113
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,400
 shop a man goes into a shop and says you don't have any meat do you um no replies to sales lady

114
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:57,760
 we don't have any fish it's a star across the street that doesn't have any meat again that's

115
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,400
 good it works doesn't it i think that's really good yeah yeah were they planning on distributing

116
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:08,000
 the big book of cia jokes about your country feels like it doesn't it my favourite person to have

117
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,840
 sort of an olympic korea career and then a follow-up is a guy called uh ross rebagliati he was the

118
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:18,400
 first person ever to win gold at the winter olympics in snowboarding which was in 1998

119
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:24,560
 and it was really sad for him because he won gold and then he was drugs tested and they found cannabis

120
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:30,240
 in his system and so he was immediately had his gold rescinded he was put in jail for maybe importing

121
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,760
 it into japan i think which is where the olympics were and then within about 72 hours they then gave

122
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,360
 the gold medal back because they went actually cannabis is not on our list of banned substances

123
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,360
 as it was not back then um but he insisted that it was from secondhand smoke uh you know he hadn't

124
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,520
 smoked weed for almost a year and it was nothing to do with him he was furious but he has now gone

125
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:58,000
 on to found a company called legacy brands a cbd and cannabis consumables company and has a series

126
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,960
 of different strains of weed named after him so that's that's his job now and since he wasn't

127
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,520
 stoned then but he's stoned all the time now i guess you can never guess what's going to happen

128
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:15,600
 can you because the the 1984 olympics promotion by mcdonald's about uh you could get a free item

129
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,960
 off the menu every time the us team got on the podium uh i don't know what you got big mac for

130
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,960
 gold or something fries for something or something um they didn't expect the soviet union to drop out

131
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:32,320
 of the olympics so many american national anthem was playing all the time and uh there was i think

132
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:38,320
 there was even a shortage of hamburger buns because people got so many so you've got to be

133
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,840
 careful what you uh what you offer up i think yeah at any olympics saying that about team usa

134
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:50,960
 is not quite cool oh you're right you want to make it team togo just be super cautious yeah

135
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:56,640
 the danish basketball team i think you're gonna make it quite nation specific jamaica winter

136
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:02,480
 olympics they had one year where it looked a bit dodgy quite a few burgers but otherwise you say

137
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:08,160
 one more thing um just that you can bite so i think you were talking at the start about how

138
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,840
 audio stuff can also maybe trigger um with hallucinations or change your brain makeup and

139
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:18,400
 actually they have now invented headphones which i think either on the market now they're coming

140
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:24,160
 onto the market soon which send electrical impulses into your brain and they cause it to release more

141
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:29,600
 like dopamine and serotonin and oxytocin like happiness hormones essentially and they're called

142
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,720
 i think they're called nirvana headphones so they stimulate the vagus nerve in your brain

143
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,280
 apparently which then releases all those neurotransmitters and they'll do it in time to the beat of

144
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:44,400
 the music you're listening to so you could even be listening to the verb or something but you'd be

145
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:52,400
 over the moon oh unnecessary burn on the verb i love the verb but they're not upbeat yeah but

146
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:59,040
 i've heard that they've tried that but the drugs don't work so it's hey there was wasn't there a

147
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:08,080
 big clash in east berlin about updating the traffic light men because really that yeah the the east

148
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:14,160
 had particular traffic light men and they were called ample menschen i think which is that literally

149
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,120
 means exactly that the traffic light man and one of the things that was proposed is replacing all

150
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,640
 of them and people in east berlin particularly said no we really we really like these particular

151
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,640
 traffic lights it's sort of a something very recognizable very iconic about the south of the

152
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:32,880
 city and so those i think were rolled out and in fact this is not useful for anyone at home but we

153
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:41,760
 have one in a jar just here oh that's what this is about for right okay let's see it can we see it

154
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:48,560
 okay yeah yeah it's here so this is a little tin of tea this is the ample man yeah and you'll recognize

155
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:54,240
 the stop and the go you know what his yeah the go man looks a bit like an old monopoly man kind of

156
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:59,280
 thing because that doesn't be yeah we've all seen lots of these right these are these are in

157
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:03,440
 berlin well it's a big souvenir thing in berlin now yeah yeah but also on the traffic lights is the

158
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,120
 noticeable thing exactly where you see a traffic light go and you're like i mean they're all the

159
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,560
 souvenirs but they were well they were kept that's the that's sort of the point yeah yeah they're

160
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,920
 really cool they're much more jaunty mmm i'm just not sure that show and tell is ever going to work

161
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:27,600
 as a podcast but it works when you had your own time so maybe the american dairy association has

162
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,720
 a page on its website called famous cows of the world and it's a good read there are a whole

163
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,680
 bunch of cows on there but my favorite was elm farm ollie do you guys know about elm farm ollie

164
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:45,120
 well neither did i but it was the first cow to fly and also the uh when i say fly i should be clear

165
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:52,000
 it's the first clown to ride in an aeroplane clown so it was a clown as well as a cow it's a

166
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:00,960
 clown cow must have had massive shoes had a red nose and huge shoes i've lost it it was the first

167
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:09,200
 cow to take a flight and it was the first cow to be milked mid-flight this was in Missouri in 1930

168
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:14,480
 and it you know all these things have some kind of spurious scientific justification and so the

169
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,280
 justification for this when they paid huge amounts of money to take it up was they wanted to observe

170
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:24,240
 the mid-air and high altitude effect on animals in flight of their milking and of their milk and

171
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,280
 it turns out it didn't make a difference to the milk but oh there was a farmer called bunts

172
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,480
 else with bunts who milked her who then also became the first person to milk a cow mid-flight

173
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:41,040
 so a huge sequence of first for elm farm ollie yeah it's good to be the one who's milking elm

174
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:46,480
 farm ollie because if you if you ask you to smell her flower it's always going to be milk that squirts

175
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:53,840
 out of it into your mouth okay that's it dad do you want to try it that a punch line to that

176
00:17:53,840 --> 00:18:01,680
 punch yeah i'd like to see you try it dad the master is smoking possibly told that

177
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:08,960
 has wonky shut down now yeah has it what no it had new management a few years ago

178
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,120
 i've definitely had it in the last year i can guarantee they don't do that kind of rude service

179
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,600
 anymore they don't do the rude service uh all their trip advisor reviews went down hill slightly

180
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,360
 after they stopped being rude to the customers because that was part of the experience they're

181
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,000
 like three stars the guy was really nice to me he gave me my meal it was amazing i went there once

182
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,200
 and we sat down on the table it was me and three other people and then halfway through the meal

183
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,280
 literally halfway through the meal we went oh we need this table now you need to go upstairs

184
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,560
 and they took all my stuff and made us sit on a much smaller table upstairs while they put other

185
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:46,640
 people on our table wow i had a meal there with top davis who is uh people will know him on tv as

186
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,600
 king gary and a few other tv shows and we went there and they put us on a big round table where

187
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:57,040
 there was an entire family sitting and we had an old grandmother sitting in between us we weren't

188
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:03,440
 even next to each other on the table oh it was wonderful great days wonkeys anyway our podcast

189
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,720
 yeah back to the podcast

190
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:18,800
 do you guys know about the debonish fibs family no you know well they're an uh extremely prominent

191
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:26,640
 family in a sense in that their names are all over park benches across the uk and so this started

192
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,800
 to be spotted about 10 years ago maybe a bit more and there are sort of park benches with you know

193
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:36,240
 there's plaques on in memory of and they're always in memory of someone debonish fibs so for instance

194
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,960
 in darmouth park near where i used to live there's one that was in memory of winter debonish fibs

195
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:47,040
 and it said like to have everything just so and then the plaque was at a lopsided angle and there

196
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:52,960
 was there was another one somewhere which was in memory of barbara debonish fibs whose wish was

197
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:58,240
 to have a bench plaque inscribed with her last words unfortunately her last words were and then

198
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:05,680
 it's a series of expectives the asterisk that's really funny currently scientists are trying to

199
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:13,280
 find out uh who killed the dodo with a ct scanner whoa there was more than one dodo though that's

200
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:20,080
 true but yes no that's true what do you mean though so do you mean like a specific one or is it i do

201
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:26,160
 mean a specific one there's a dodo in oxford's museum of natural history and uh it's a celebrity

202
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,480
 dodo actually although these days all dodo's are celebrities but um this is the one that

203
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,960
 lewis carol may have seen when he was writing alice in wonderland and it might have inspired the

204
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:41,520
 dodo in that but scientists thought that it had been killed uh some some way or that it had died

205
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,360
 of natural causes actually because they thought it would be brought to uk threw it on a bonfire or

206
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,200
 something i thought they destroyed it yeah well they've still got the skull all right that's the

207
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,880
 main thing and so they they put the skull in a ct scanner and they found it didn't have natural

208
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:00,320
 causes it was shot in the head with a shotgun so that is the opposite of natural causes um

209
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,960
 and what they're trying to do now they've got a little bit of the lead that kind of impacted

210
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,520
 with the back of the skull and they're trying to find out what country the lead from those shotgun

211
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:14,720
 pellets was mined in and then they're going to try and find out where the shot was made from that

212
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,360
 lead and they basically they're on the longest cold case ever where they're trying to find out 400

213
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:26,320
 years later who pulled the trigger wow oh gosh what are they gonna do if prison is great great great

214
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,960
 great grandchildren yeah exactly they're gonna get a knock on their door where are you on the fourth

215
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:39,360
 of march 1596 it's just i was just looking into the quirks of iceland the country um i didn't know

216
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:47,440
 this beer was banned there until 1989 really it was banned in 1915 they had a referendum and they

217
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:53,360
 decided to ban beer and then in 1921 they had to change it a bit they legalized wine because

218
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:59,200
 spain threatened to stop buying iceland's fish if iceland kept on refusing to import spanish wine

219
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:05,120
 so they said okay i'm gonna have some wine and then they they allowed very very weak beer but they

220
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:10,480
 didn't allow normal strength beer and this backfired badly because people just started putting vodka

221
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:16,320
 into their incredibly weak beer and making a kind of horrible beer and vodka cocktail oh some of that

222
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,840
 some of the spirits that you get in iceland are unbelievable i went to there's a restaurant that

223
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:28,160
 specializes in slightly sort of quirky food and i ordered the fermented chuck and it comes in a jar

224
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:33,760
 sealed kilner jar with a rubber thing and a very very strong glass of what are we called a schnapps

225
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:40,320
 i don't know what you call it it's a very strong um pure alcohol thing uh and uh i said to the guy

226
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:46,000
 i didn't order the schnapps he said you're going to need and you because for the sake of the other

227
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,720
 diners you have to open the jar really really quickly and grab a little spoonful of this stuff

228
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:56,400
 and stick it in your mouth and close it because it smells so terrible and the taste was the most

229
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,760
 disgusting thing i've ever had it burned back at my throat and i and i did take a take the schnapps

230
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:07,600
 as a shot i drank it so quickly anything to make the taste of the fermented shot go away

231
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,440
 really thought you were going to turn around and say the amazing thing is it smells awful but the

232
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:18,080
 taste is disgusting no it smells awful and also tastes awful correct um hey one bit of royal etiquette

233
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:24,160
 which i think is um upheld in the royal family as opposed to being upheld by the tabloid press

234
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:29,920
 is eating etiquette which is that and it doesn't it makes sense so the queen is served first you

235
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:33,920
 would serve the queen first at a dinner and then when she stops eating really you're supposed to

236
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:40,080
 stop eating as well and this has existed for a few hundred years and it was really difficult

237
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,720
 with queen victoria because this was the practice then as well but queen victoria the thing about

238
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:50,480
 her was she was incredibly greedy she used to eat extremely fast like her advisors used to say

239
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:56,720
 stop eating so fast she got terrible indigestion she could eat seven courses in half an hour apparently

240
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,360
 and she was always served first and so the people who were served last by the time they got their

241
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,280
 plates they were sort of immediately whipped away from them again because queen victoria had

242
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:11,120
 inhaled her first course i gotta say anna we've been for dinner quite a lot of times and you will

243
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:17,440
 not let a plate go if there's any food left on it no matter whose plate it was yeah is this why

244
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,000
 you've never met the queen because it's i did it once and i've been banned from dining with the queen

245
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,960
 since desperately trying to lick everyone's plates is that it was taken away i had a quick look at

246
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:33,760
 some things that you could get sent to prison for in finland oh yeah in 2015 the police asked

247
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:40,000
 the members of the public that if they saw a pizza that was on sale for under six euros to inform the

248
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:48,800
 police the way that they saw it is it's impossible to run a business where you sell pizzas for less

249
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:53,520
 than six euros it's just the ingredients are too much it's completely impossible so if people are

250
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,400
 doing that it means that they can't be paying the tax on the pizza which means that they must

251
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:04,320
 be tax avoiders uh and so they asked literally asked people to say as soon if you see any pizza

252
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:10,000
 on sale for underneath that price send us the menu and we'll arrest the guys that's so funny

253
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,640
 that is a bargain price for a whole pizza yeah it is really unless you're in a shop in a shop

254
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:20,800
 it's the kind of normal price for a shop pizza that's a very very posh shop pizza really isn't it

255
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,960
 but i mean there are pizzas around the corner that you can take away delicious for a fiver

256
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,760
 and i'm now wondering if it's my responsibility to be informing on them just tell the police in

257
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:34,320
 finland because obviously the taxes in finland are a bit higher than they are in the uk so

258
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,360
 probably it's more of a seven pound thing in the uk oh you feel bad if you got the whole

259
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:46,480
 stuff and structure of the co-op sent to finish prison what are you in for i'm also in for selling

260
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:55,760
 this pizza there's the pizza wing isn't there they're hard and criminals i went on ebay um to

261
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:00,560
 look at what the most expensive items currently on ebay are that you can buy that are related to

262
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:07,360
 lincoln did you find the horse hair yes so good so there's a look of hair there's a look of hair

263
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:15,440
 from uh the horse you rode in the 1860 election called old bob and um old bob attended his funeral

264
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:21,120
 and for just one thousand two hundred and fifty dollars you can buy a hair of this horse

265
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:27,120
 one hair yeah actually yeah it's not a long strand one hair a single hair yeah you wouldn't

266
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,200
 like if you open the envelope that could just fall onto the carpet and you've lost it if you're a

267
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,800
 mafioso and you don't have the resources to put a whole horse's head on someone's pillow i'm just

268
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:42,000
 thinking that you know as a middle-aged man who's losing his hair it shouldn't i shouldn't be letting

269
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,320
 it go down the drain i should be saving this in case i become president or like the president's

270
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,960
 also something in the future i don't know surely this is our next tour match park inside

271
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:58,560
 i've got just one last thing about sort of ingenious ways of catching poachers people

272
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:04,400
 who are trying to illegally catch all of these fish um during the early 80s to about 1998 there

273
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:10,000
 was a guy who worked for the california u.s fish and wildlife service and his name was terry gross

274
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,520
 and he was sort of sick of the fact that there were poachers that would go in the early morning

275
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:20,000
 to catch all this salmon when that was highly illegal so you usually had to stop half an hour

276
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,680
 after sunset and they would drive out at two or three in the morning and they would get away

277
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:28,160
 with it because the tracks that were leading to all of these lakes were monitored by other poachers

278
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:32,800
 so if they saw a truck come down that they knew was one of the wardens they would say quickly get

279
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:37,200
 the boat in get out of there so they had plenty of warning so he had no idea what to do but then

280
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:43,360
 he came up with this idea of putting on a wetsuit getting into the water before the day ended

281
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:48,160
 and waiting patiently and what he would do is while they were fishing salmon he would loosen

282
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:53,600
 the glove of his wetsuit and as they were fishing it would hook onto his glove and he would slowly

283
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,920
 splash around and they would start going oh my god i've caught a massive salmon and he would go

284
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:01,120
 harder and harder and they're like this is the biggest salmon we've ever got they've got this on

285
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:06,240
 recording these words and they would slowly come in and they would get to him and as they got right

286
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:11,280
 up to him he would say good morning gentlemen state fish and game warden you're under arrest

287
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:16,400
 and he would pull out he would pull out of his wetsuit a citation book and he would give them

288
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:23,440
 their fides and then he would go back in and try and catch more people and hire a glass mpr and this

289
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,000
 american life um looked into it and they found that there were plenty of these people that used to do

290
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:34,400
 this sit there for hours and get caught by a fisherman yeah wait but did they so did they

291
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:38,640
 have their heads under water while they were waggling their glove above the water no because

292
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:45,120
 it was so dark so they would they would sort of yes sit above and yeah but just in a nice little

293
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:50,800
 spot it's brilliant this guy's an amazing guy that's real commitment to the job i don't know if

294
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:56,880
 i'd sit in freezing cold water for a full day in a pond to catch a poacher i had a neighbour once

295
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:05,040
 an elderly neighbour who would sleep in his car to try and catch car thieves really and he and he

296
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:12,880
 called them right yeah waggling keys out of the window as soon as someone grabs them i was just

297
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,760
 thinking them that this guy who's pretending to be a fish basically he's lucky that they're not

298
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:25,360
 catching them with dynamite isn't he yeah because that does not work well actually

299
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:32,960
 in the example in this interview they heard somebody go and get the net get the net and

300
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:41,200
 then another voice goes get the net heck get the gun so one more thing about uh

301
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,640
 olympians who have other jobs you know the brian brothers the the tennis the tennis guys the tennis

302
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,120
 brands yeah we absolutely love the brian brothers uh so it's sort of best doubles partnership ever

303
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:56,640
 of all time they've won a billion olympic medals and they have a second i don't know if i can call

304
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,400
 it a job so i don't know how much profit they make from it but they also are a band they have the

305
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:07,120
 brian brothers band and so bob plays the keyboard and mike is on uh the guitar or drums but he's

306
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:12,080
 not on the drums when the drummer of the counting crows joins them which he does sometimes so like

307
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:18,080
 the jit band and i mention it because everyone has to look up the 2009 song autograph which

308
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:25,440
 i'd forgotten about but is it features cameos from andy murray and no fact jokovic and i'm

309
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,440
 telling you i i wished to god it was this andy murray here because that would have been less

310
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:35,200
 awkward than what they make andy murray the tennis player do it's it's about what a horrible

311
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,000
 jurid is signing autographs after matches and andy murray's little rap section in the middle

312
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:47,840
 includes the lyrics during wimbledon it gets really crazy my hand cramps up and my mind gets hazy

313
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:53,040
 and um look i'm going to leave people to imagine the rest andy murray's rap section is never

314
00:30:53,040 --> 00:31:00,000
 the words that should never ever be put together another fun thing about ghost crabs is that they're

315
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:06,240
 very house proud but only when they are sexually mature which maybe is the same for humans so when

316
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:11,200
 males are not sexually mature and if you get female house crabs they burrow into the sand and

317
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,480
 they leave these tiny little holes in the sand they're smaller than a tiny coin but they can go

318
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,600
 four or five feet down which i think is kind of cool anyway they burrow holes into the sand and

319
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,680
 they just throw the sand anywhere the sound that they've used to borrow they just chuck it all over

320
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:31,920
 the beach but as soon as they hit sexual maturity they suddenly sculpt the sand into a perfect pyramid

321
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:36,080
 and this is to sort of advertise themselves to ladies we think so a woman can look across a

322
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:41,280
 beach and she'll spot the sexually mature men by the perfect pyramids that are next to their

323
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:46,320
 entrances and you'll see you'll see the little entrance and then a little crabby footsteps

324
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:51,600
 footprints going to the pyramid do you think that if a ghost crab goes to egypt they look over and

325
00:31:51,600 --> 00:32:00,880
 they go fucking hell there is a very attractive enormous ghost crab over there yeah very intimidating

326
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:08,880
 trip very intimidating stag do for those males so you can find out a lot of things from city scans

327
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:16,240
 of mummies they tried to they city scanned an egyptian priest called nas yamun and they scanned

328
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:22,320
 his throat and his vocal cords and they could find out what his voice was like so they did the city

329
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:29,040
 scan of his vocal cords they created a 3d printed vocal tract and then they kind of fired air down

330
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:34,960
 it and they could work out exactly what he sounded like um and it's basically people on the internet

331
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:41,680
 think he sounded a bit like britney spears cool oh i thought i thought i thought he just went

332
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:52,560
 he goes like like that and you know how she goes yeah that's your cat you're thinking of

333
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:58,880
 oh yeah sorry that's not pretty but yeah there was basically um they the sound did the rounds on

334
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:05,520
 social media and a lot of britney spears fans were very excited about it wow i'm some released

335
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:10,800
 material from 2000 years ago well the interesting thing is like nas yamun would have he was a priest

336
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:16,240
 so he would have done a lot of singing and chanting in the temples so basically if you went back to

337
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,720
 ancient egypt and you walked past the temple it would sound like someone's singing baby one more time

338
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:27,600
 wow he wouldn't have been dressed as a schoolgirl though seems implausible might have been there's

339
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:34,000
 probably a lot less chess players online than we actually think there are because they create fake

340
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:40,320
 accounts and they build them up and up to be sort of well played chess players with high rankings

341
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,720
 and then they play themselves and defeat that person so it's sort of creating bogus accounts in

342
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:54,000
 order to defeat them and then raise your ranking imagine if it's just one guy have you heard of

343
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:00,320
 sandbagging that's another cheating thing so yeah this is where you play deliberately badly to

344
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:05,040
 qualify for a tournament that is actually a bit beneath you and then you win you take the brakes

345
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:11,520
 off and you you thumb everybody that's that happens in golf as well people claim like you

346
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:16,000
 you play badly for ages until your handicap gets way worse and then eventually you go right

347
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,400
 today is the day that i'm going to try and win the tournament it's extremely locked down upon

348
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:25,440
 yeah yeah well they've got measures in place don't they i think they have actual measures

349
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,160
 in place now on the chess side to stop that so i think if you ever yeah i think it's if you ever

350
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:35,360
 achieved certain high scores they look at it and go well there's no way that you can now suck that

351
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:40,720
 much because you got to this level and if you if you won a certain amount of cash prize like a high

352
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:46,080
 cash prize well how did you get to that you must be good you must be sandbagging us in order to

353
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:50,160
 to do that so very embarrassing if you're not sandbagging and you are just having a really bad

354
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:59,120
 exact night have you just got lucky one time yeah it happened i think they had to change the rules

355
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:04,480
 or tighten them a few years ago because there was a middle school so sad when you're sort of forcing

356
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:10,080
 12 year olds to do this but in texas it's called henderson middle school and they entered a competition

357
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:16,400
 where you had to have a ranking under 900 and then they absolutely smashed it they were investigated

358
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:22,400
 and it turned out they'd lost all of their previous 28 matches and they're really good and someone

359
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,720
 worked out the chances of having lost them all being as good as they were and it was one in

360
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:33,920
 sextillion that they could have lost all 28 which is like if they'd been then playing chess since

361
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,920
 the start of the universe and everywhere in the universe it still wouldn't have happened probably

362
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:44,160
 so they were disqualified but 12 year olds come on okay i think it's not impossible that some

363
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,840
 people get to a really good position on chess.com because they're only playing people who are

364
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:53,280
 deliberately losing in order to sandbag so they think they're incredible they win a big cash prize

365
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,880
 and then the next time they play it their deficiencies are revealed and then they get banned

366
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,560
 from playing because chess.com thinks they were the ones doing it it's absolutely mind field

367
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:07,120
 it's a vicious cycle um other people who go down um sort of scavenging and and hunting around the

368
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:13,120
 the lost rivers are the it's tiburn is that the pronunciation is it the tiburn angling society

369
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:18,720
 yes the tiburn angling society it's just wonderful they they meet up once a year to report on the

370
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:24,720
 fish they found it's always zero so it's not the greatest angling society but they are obsessed

371
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:31,360
 with the idea of daylighting which is the idea of bringing these hidden rivers back to the surface

372
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:36,400
 through destruction of the stuff on top of bringing the tiburn back to being what it once

373
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,920
 gloriously was and it's an extraordinary thing that they put together in around 2000 where they

374
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:47,040
 put a full report to show how they would do it where it would go it would demolish about one

375
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:51,760
 billion pounds worth of real estate unfortunately telling it's only Buckingham Palace that needs

376
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:58,880
 to go really it's Buckingham Palace that's part of their plan they want to get rid of it

377
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:04,720
 i've one more thing about Houdini's habits at home when Houdini and his wife had an argument

378
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:10,000
 he would leave he'd walk around the block and then he'd come back and he would open the door of

379
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,360
 the room where his wife was and throw his hat into the room right if it was thrown out again

380
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:21,440
 she was still angry and i guess he would do it again and if the hat remained in the room

381
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:26,880
 she she calmed down and they were going and resolve it what if the argument was about him

382
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,600
 leaving his clothes hanging around the house all the time like a lot of the arguments in my house

383
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:41,600
 so i read a paper called Man and mongooses in indian culture by Derek Olodrick i'm not sure

384
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:47,680
 that's how you pronounce his name but i'm looking up afterwards and i found the oldest known story

385
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:53,040
 about mongooses and it's from 3 000 years ago there's a king who's having a feast and then a

386
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:58,720
 mongoose walks in and half of his body is made out of gold and he comes in and he rolls in all

387
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:03,520
 the food of the feast and the king's like what the hell are you doing and he said oh well i once

388
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:10,080
 rolled in the food of a brahman uh like a really holy uh hindu guy uh and the brahman was so holy

389
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:15,120
 that he turned when he rolled in his food he turned half into gold and this mongoose is going

390
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:21,520
 around looking for another holy person so he can turn his whole body into gold right i don't know

391
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:26,560
 if you want your whole body turned into gold i'm pretty sure king miters taught us that didn't he

392
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:31,760
 yeah i really haven't come across each other king miters didn't turn into gold did he yeah

393
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,560
 no no he turned everything he touched into gold he didn't like get a gold finger

394
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,160
 and then no but what he but he regressed his leg and he had a gold leg i know he regressed it

395
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,520
 because he couldn't eat but wait a minute what happened no no he regressed it because you couldn't

396
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:47,040
 well partly because you if you touched another person who he loved they turned into gold and

397
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:51,280
 that's based on the fact that people don't want to be turned into gold yeah what happened if

398
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:56,640
 with king miters touched himself do we know in is it in the story or they didn't do that in those

399
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:04,080
 days james it was a cleaner time i there was something about finland that was actually the

400
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:08,960
 original article i read and it's about um and so an amazing fact that i didn't know and i can't

401
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:13,840
 remember how the journalist lewis segwayed into it but i'm just going to segue into it by saying

402
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:20,000
 she also mentioned that finland's only monarch the only monarch it's ever had is this german guy

403
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:26,160
 who never visited finland that's all right and they this is in 1917 they got independence from

404
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:31,840
 russia and they started off thinking we want a king everyone else has got or a queen um everyone

405
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:35,360
 else has got one where should we find one we obviously don't have a royal family here in

406
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:40,720
 finland because we're brand new and so they picked this guy uh frederick charles of hess

407
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,720
 and he was a german prince they designed a crown for him which i think you can still

408
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:49,600
 see it's on display somewhere in finland and then before he even had a chance to enter the country

409
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,680
 they changed their mind uh after a few months and he abdicated

410
00:39:53,680 --> 00:40:01,360
 ah that's it that's did he abdicate from overseas as in he yeah he was out still outside god that's

411
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:06,160
 been good in those days when there were all those new countries being formed and if you were if you

412
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,800
 were a minor noble in anywhere in europe whenever there was a new country you must have been there

413
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,680
 with your fingers crossed thinking oh maybe i'm going to be king at that you're sitting in the

414
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,920
 waiting room with all the other potential monarchs going in for their interviews

415
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:26,640
 i hope that bastard from schleswig holstein doesn't get it he's coming out looking all cocky

416
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,800
 really ace the practical the waving section of the interview

417
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:39,440
 here's one quick thing on forgeries um there is a forger or there was a forger called elmer

418
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:45,600
 de horre he was a hungarian um in the united states and he did forgeries of loads of people

419
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:52,880
 Picasso matisse and he did loads of forgeries of madigliani okay and he did so many madigliani

420
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:57,920
 that these days it's impossible to compile a catalogue of madigliani's work because we don't

421
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:03,520
 know what is real and what is a forgery by this guy de horre and the reason i bring it up is because

422
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:10,640
 he has a collection of all of his forgeries and it's run by a guy called mark forgy no

423
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:15,200
 who's got extremely fast internet as well hasn't

424
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:26,080
 i like to have you guys come across freddy and truce overstegan no who were not today not

425
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:33,200
 he's not at the hotel here um they were part of the dutch resistance in fact and they were

426
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:40,080
 14 and 16 years old respectively and they were killers cold-blooded killers and they called

427
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:44,960
 their kills liquidations which was kind of terrifying and apparently the 14 year old actually

428
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,720
 looked about 12 so it was quite easy for them to get away with killing because no one expected

429
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:54,400
 to be killed by a 12 year old girl and the way they did it was they had various methods but they

430
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:59,840
 cycled around quite a lot i guess cycling was a thing for these resistance ladies and they would

431
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:04,960
 ambush collaborators so they'd be on two bikes and they'd have pistols in their bike baskets

432
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,760
 and they'd ambush them or sometimes they'd do a drive-by so freddy would be riding the bike and

433
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,800
 truce would be on the back and you know cycle past them collaborators and just shoot them up as you

434
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:21,280
 ride by off into the sunset and what was the liquidation bit or was that just a fancy they

435
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:26,400
 would just shoot them as opposed there was no melting down no they didn't have like a vat of

436
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:32,880
 acid in their cellar they dragged Nazi bodies cool get back what you didn't melt them down

437
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:38,320
 no we just we just did a drive-by and shot them well you got to melt them down mate

438
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:42,880
 maybe they did because i didn't look into it enough there are a few sort of modern

439
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:47,680
 loopholes for companies in britain that don't have a liquor license and i was reading about one

440
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:53,280
 place which was there was a new craft distillery in yorkshire that was being set up in a disused

441
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:58,400
 train station so they'd done it up and it was for it was going to be for gin i believe and it's

442
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:03,280
 called tapling and megan distilleries and by the time they were about to launch all the paperwork

443
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:08,320
 hadn't been done yet for their license but they had this big party that they wanted to promote

444
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:14,000
 their drinks so what they had to do was they looked and found a loophole which is if you're on a

445
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,120
 moving train you don't need a liquor license so all trains that you buy alcohol on they don't

446
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:23,600
 need a license a moving train is exempt from it and the fact that they were in a train station

447
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:28,400
 and they had a parked train there they got all the guests onto the train and they took it on a

448
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:33,200
 two and a half hour ride just to one they just went one way turned around well not even turned

449
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:39,280
 around just drove back again and did a two and a half hour gin masterclass once it was in motion

450
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:44,640
 and that that allowed them the loophole of of having the party still if you had a bar which had

451
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:51,920
 a miniature train on the counter so it sort of came two chewing along with your drink does that

452
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:56,320
 count and then you wouldn't need a liquor license maybe you have to be on the train so if you went

453
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:01,200
 to like what's that um what's that sushi place which has got the conveyor belt if you got a young

454
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:07,360
 sushi and you sit on the conveyor belt technically you don't need a license don't sit on one of the

455
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:12,960
 coloured plates you will be selected um i was looking at other ways that museums need to preserve

456
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:19,200
 their artefacts and one is from fires serious problem and it's a really difficult choice for

457
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:24,640
 museums because the main way to get rid of fires is with sprinkler systems but obviously if you

458
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:30,960
 sprinkle a whole art gallery then you sort of ruin the paintings that way but so a lot of museums

459
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,600
 kind of don't do it and that was a serious problem in brazil you might remember a couple of years

460
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:41,200
 ago when the main museum in brazil destroyed 90 percent of its collection because of a fire and

461
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:46,720
 they just didn't have the adequate protection but there is one place the Getty Museum in LA

462
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:53,120
 which has such cool fireproof systems so they have like they had the big wildfires last year

463
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:58,480
 and they were pretty much licking at the sides of the museum and the curators were completely

464
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:03,920
 chilled out about it because it's so well protected so it's full of like Rembrandt's and Manet's but

465
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:08,560
 they first of all they have a system where the oxygen can get sucked out of the rooms

466
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:12,720
 so that as soon as a fire got in there it wouldn't be able to breathe and so it would just immediately

467
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:18,560
 go out so it's like an anti-ventilation system and then they also have around the museum a million

468
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:24,160
 gallon water tank and so as soon as a fire starts coming close they just start releasing water into

469
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:29,120
 the ground all around the museum like a moat it's great and so firefighters who are fighting the

470
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:33,760
 wildfires use the museum as like a rest area and a vantage point to look around at the rest of LA

471
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:42,640
 and go ah well I guess I guess the art's okay wow really clever that's really clever uh well just

472
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:48,000
 speaking of water um there was a museum in Spain which is the Museum of Underwater Archaeology

473
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,920
 which is called Aqua uh and they've had a real problem with leaks this year

474
00:45:51,920 --> 00:46:00,560
 now hang on honestly they get all of their stuff is stuff that's been found underwater like statues

475
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:06,000
 which are sunk or with um shipwrecks or anything that's come from the bottom of the ocean and they

476
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:12,800
 have hundreds of thousands of things in there but they also have leaks in the basement and a lot of

477
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,400
 damp causing problems with the wall and they're really worried about it and they reckon that it's

478
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,840
 going to wreck all of the things which have been under water for thousands hundreds of years

479
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:27,680
 oh no um have you guys heard of at nuclear trains a twitter account no no this is a really cool one

480
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:32,800
 so it's a twitter bot um and it's made by two scientists who are called Matt Allinson and

481
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:38,160
 Keir Little and what it does is it tracks trains which are carrying nuclear waste across the UK

482
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:44,320
 so these trains go I didn't know they existed actually is that sorry I didn't know there were

483
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:49,040
 trains that had uh nuclear well right you it's not they're yet to tweet

484
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:57,440
 no no um well yeah I mean it's not it's not common knowledge but they sort of they have you have to

485
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:02,080
 transport radioactive containers and trains are not a bad way of doing it they're very tightly

486
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:08,480
 sealed um and these guys they're not pro or anti nuclear they they genuinely are just in it for

487
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:15,200
 the trains as they say um and they have clarified that the radiation you would get because sometimes

488
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:20,400
 these pass along platforms you know they go through brickson or whatever quite near passengers

489
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,360
 but they've said that the radiation you would get if you were on the platform one of these

490
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:28,000
 trains went by will be like you just eat one banana isn't that amazing that everyone on the

491
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,640
 platform has just eaten the equivalent of one banana but would you feel it would you feel full

492
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:42,800
 everyone slips over on the platform yeah no they don't emit bananas um they just get that much

493
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:48,480
 radiation yeah exactly yeah yeah yeah but that's quite dangerous because if you are such a banana

494
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,640
 lover that you're constantly operating on the banana eating cusp of getting radiation poisoning

495
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:58,400
 and you manage it right you know you're eating 350 bananas a day and you know 351 would tip you

496
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:03,520
 over the edge yeah yeah you're right yeah what happens then Andy if a train full of bananas

497
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:08,240
 passes by what is the radiation level in that at that speed that that kills you immediately

498
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:14,480
 so you have to transport bananas one by one don't they that's why they're so expensive once they

499
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:21,040
 get to the shops do you know that this is one of my favorite totally random facts but you know

500
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:27,120
 Penny Mordant who was very briefly actually Defense Secretary last year yeah and before that was

501
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:34,160
 International Development Secretary you know she's named after a Royal Navy frigate wow she's named

502
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:40,400
 after HMS Penelope that's so funny isn't that weird that's a really good giant frigate it's

503
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:45,600
 because she's from an army family and actually it was known as HMS Pepperpot because it was

504
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:51,040
 shelled so many so many times in World War two so she could easily be Pepperpot Mordant

505
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:59,760
 don't she do that dive which is is that Iron Man's wife Pepperpots is Iron Man's girlfriend yeah

506
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:04,560
 oh really yeah maybe that's why they didn't go with Pepperpot they didn't want her to be confused

507
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:09,280
 why is she called Pepperpots it's a weird name it's because she comes from a comic book like all

508
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:15,040
 these characters that they often they often have quite funny names and illiterate names don't they

509
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:23,120
 yeah good point I read about one plane crash or you know emergency landing in 2013 this guy called

510
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:27,760
 John Pedersen and he realized that his plane had had a little bit of damage and he wasn't going to

511
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:34,240
 make it all the way to the nearest airports this was in around Chicago and so he saw a long road

512
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:39,200
 and he thought well you know that's probably the best way to go I'm going to try and stop on this

513
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:43,600
 road but obviously there's traffic on this road so he doesn't want to hit any and what he managed to

514
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:49,040
 do was exactly time it so that when the lights went red and everyone stops that's when he landed

515
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:54,400
 in the middle of this intersection is that amazing wow that's his story and he's sticking to it

516
00:49:54,400 --> 00:50:01,680
 I was reading this article about it in the Chicago newspaper and they said that he landed and didn't

517
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:05,680
 hit anyone and he was in the middle of this intersection and then the lights changed and

518
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:13,280
 two cars just went and didn't notice him and crashed into him what and then just apparently

519
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:20,240
 it says and then mysteriously sped off so they kind of drove hit this plane and then thought oh

520
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:24,560
 shit I've just hit a plane and they just did a hit and run on this left the seat of the accident

521
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:29,440
 so I can't be bothered to fill the form in on this one no one's going to believe that are they

522
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:34,640
 I'm never going to get this sort of claim this plane just pulled out in front of me

523
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:44,720
 people always think that pneumatic technology is going to be the next big thing I think there was

524
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:51,680
 a lot of excitement in the US about 40 years ago that it was going to be how we all disposed of our

525
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:57,360
 rubbish and so Disneyland I think was a pioneer of this right so their entire garbage disposal

526
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:02,560
 system is fully pneumatic so if you're in Disneyland you put something in a bin and then it drops down

527
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:07,600
 into a tunnel system and every 20 minutes it just gets sucked about 60 miles an hour to a collection

528
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:11,680
 point there are a lot of theme park nerds who are about to get angry at you because it's the magic

529
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:16,480
 kingdom of Walt Disney world in Florida not Disneyland I guarantee you're gonna thank you for

530
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:22,160
 that correction I got to do a behind the scenes tour there once so I actually got to see some of the

531
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:27,200
 tunnels that those go through and you're just kind of walking through the backstage tunnels and there's

532
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:31,520
 just this tube next to you where every 20 minutes or so you just hear this hang on so do you do you

533
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:37,280
 have to sort of dive out the way every 20 minutes no it's just it's just a tube on a wall it's not

534
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:42,640
 like a transparent how big is the tube can you fit a human in it it's 20 inches diameter I think

535
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:51,280
 can you fit a mouse in it 20 inches okay so that's pretty big yeah I reckon yeah I I've been to

536
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:55,920
 Disneyland and Disney world as well and the rides I don't really like them as much I prefer the

537
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:01,040
 Universal ones the rides but if there was a garbage chute I think then I would be definitely

538
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,320
 going for you could sell t-shirts saying why don't you get sucked off at Disneyland

539
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:12,160
 like the rubbish for our pneumatic tube system I will I will argue with you for like half an hour

540
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:16,400
 that Universal's rides are terrible compared to Disney's but we do not have the time for that

541
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:29,520
 have you heard of Jebediah Buxton uh no I don't think so my favorite plaque plucky

542
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:38,640
 in the UK lived in Derbyshire the label is mental calculator so Jebediah Buxton lived in the early

543
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:45,360
 18th century I we think he was an autistic savant you know people who could do unbelievable

544
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:50,720
 calculations in their head so Jebediah Buxton was once asked after a church sermon what did

545
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:56,800
 you think of the sermon and he said oh I just counted how many words there were in it he just

546
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:02,640
 gave a word count that's so good I know he was self he was completely self-taught not formally

547
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:06,320
 trained at all and didn't know much about anything except numbers but knew everything about numbers

548
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:09,760
 so he walked around the local area which is called Elmton which is about a thousand acres

549
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:16,240
 and he could give its size not only in acres but also in square inches wow he was amazing

550
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:19,680
 sorry I have no idea what you just said because I was trying to count the number of words you were

551
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:23,120
 saying

552
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:30,080
 not as easy as it sounds is it it really isn't really is not uh if you get a seal and you blindfold

553
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:36,800
 it and you give it a pair of earmuffs then it can't find fish um I'm not surprised yeah yeah

554
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:42,640
 I'm not surprised at all actually sorry I've misread this they can find fish oh if you blindfold

555
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:46,640
 them and give them earmuffs okay that's gone from being an incredibly underwhelming fact

556
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:52,080
 it's being quite interesting and it's because they use their whiskers right and the whiskers

557
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:58,480
 can tell the movements in the water and this is amazing so when fish swim we talked before that

558
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:03,520
 they have like lots of eddies and vortices and stuff like that which they leave in the water

559
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:10,160
 these seals whiskers can detect these tiny little vortices in a fish that swam past 30 seconds ago

560
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:15,120
 so it swam past 30 seconds ago and it can still feel where it was and then it can still follow the

561
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:22,560
 track of the fish to get that even if it's wearing earmuffs oh wow that is amazing can it tell sort

562
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:28,400
 of the time that's passed rather than up to 30 like can they be like oh 15 seconds ahead because

563
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:34,720
 they can tell the strength of the wait they can't tell the future not the future what I'm saying

564
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:40,720
 is they could count up to 30 but when they feel it let's say it's a wake that comes past 15 seconds

565
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:45,440
 after it's been there can they know it's 15 seconds I don't know if they can count up to 30

566
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:52,080
 I don't know if they know it's exactly 30 but I think they will have a basic idea of time

567
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:57,040
 and we'll know that and know that the vortices will be stronger if it has gone more recently

568
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:00,560
 passed I mean it's like smelling something you know you feel like getting stronger as you get

569
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:04,720
 closer don't you yeah you don't when you're trying to find something in your house where the smells

570
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:10,240
 coming from you're not counting this you know your nose isn't saying that's exactly five meters away

571
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:17,280
 but you can tell that it's closer or further guys don't do that I think if you want to sue anyone

572
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:25,040
 you should sue the makers of Sherlock Holmes baffled have you guys seen that movie no it's from 1900

573
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:32,720
 it's the first ever movie with Sherlock Holmes in it and it's an American silent film and basically

574
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:39,760
 it's very much against the canon of Sherlock Holmes because what happens is people keep kind of

575
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:45,200
 stealing things from under his nose and then using trick photography they just disappear

576
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:50,320
 and then you just get a picture of Sherlock Holmes going oh what happened there why did they disappear

577
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:54,000
 and then they reappear in another part of the room and then they steal something else

578
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:59,840
 and then disappear again and it goes on like that for a couple of minutes and I just don't think

579
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:05,120
 that that's really I mean first of all he doesn't solve anything he just stands there looking confused

580
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:10,320
 yeah he's baffled yeah well that was made in 1900 I believe right is that right James so there's

581
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:18,000
 another one which I'd love to see 1916 the mystery of the leaping fish and this was a movie where

582
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:25,280
 Sherlock Holmes was sort of lampooed by Douglas Fairbanks Douglas Fairbanks junior who was one

583
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:30,400
 of Hollywood's leading actors at the time he was a swashbuckling adventurer and he along with Charlie

584
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:35,280
 Chaplin they set up they set up UA United Artists and he was a huge influence in Hollywood back in

585
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:40,960
 the day and he played basically the druggy version of Sherlock Holmes really bringing up that side

586
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:46,560
 of his character so the way that in the movie he was presented he wasn't called Sherlock Holmes

587
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:55,840
 he was called Coke Anyday E-N-N-Y-D-A-Y as his surname and he had a bandolier of syringes that he

588
00:56:55,840 --> 00:57:02,480
 wore across his chest so he was constantly injecting himself as the movie went along with cocaine yeah

589
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:09,120
 he had a clock with the clock face it says eats drinks sleeps and dope instead of the numbers

590
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:15,280
 so he would know when to inject himself and the idea was that Coke Anyday was trying to find all

591
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:20,080
 of these drug barons and once he caught them he would sample all the drugs that they had

592
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:26,000
 as he was busting them and Fairbanks hated the movie after it came out it was only a two-realer

593
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:31,200
 and he just said this is horrific but that's one of the earliest Sherlock Holmes movies as well

594
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:40,400
 amazing do you say 1916? 1916 yeah houses but that Dan that was the first year as the first full length

595
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:46,000
 Sherlock Holmes film but this was a bit more serious because he was because it wasn't a mad

596
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:52,960
 cocaine rob it was um he was played by William Gillette who was a distant cousin of the Gillette

597
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:59,680
 razor family yeah Gillette exactly yeah um and uh William Gillette was a really interesting guy so

598
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:05,040
 he only played Sherlock Holmes in one movie but um that was after he played him on stage about

599
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:10,720
 1,300 times he'd come up with a stage version of it and yeah and he and Arthur Conan Doyle were

600
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:16,640
 actually friends they I mean Arthur Conan Doyle was probably pleased because he managed to work

601
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:20,480
 out a way of doing the character well on stage and it was you know respectful and all of this

602
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:26,480
 but also entertaining and when they met I really like this William Gillette um they were meeting

603
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:33,200
 I think on the same train and Gillette got off the train dressed as Holmes and then he found Arthur

604
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:38,640
 Conan Doyle and he examined him through a magnifying glass and that was from that point onwards they

605
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:45,760
 were firm friends Conan Doyle loved it yeah that's it's a risky move isn't it because he really is

606
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:53,360
 yeah yeah he might think you were taking the piss a little bit but we also we had um temperance bars

607
00:58:53,360 --> 00:59:00,000
 in Britain which were super popular around the end of the 19th century again with this big push to

608
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,880
 stop people drinking and apparently for every little mill town there would be at least three

609
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:10,320
 temperance bars which is essentially like a I mean the cafe like a milk bar like it's a cafe

610
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:15,360
 yeah I think they might they used to be not not that long ago there was definitely one in Lancashire

611
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:20,720
 I know that much well there's one left now and uh it's Fitzpatrick's in Lancashire you're absolutely

612
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:27,040
 right and the owner of Fitzpatrick's in 2012 he'd just been on Harry Biker's actually and talking

613
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:31,840
 about the great stuff about non-alcoholic drinks like dandelion burdock and how great abstinence is

614
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:39,200
 and how popular the bar still was and then he was done for drink driving have you guys heard of the

615
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:48,160
 nuclear bomb that was dropped on the gregs but I can understand that okay gregs well no I've tricked

616
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:53,760
 you with my words this is the story of the only nuclear bomb that has ever been dropped on American

617
00:59:53,760 --> 01:00:00,720
 soil by an American plane okay and it fell on the family who were called the gregs um they lived in

618
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:06,880
 South Carolina parents three kids uh their cousin everyone was playing the kids were playing in the

619
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:12,800
 in the yard next door to the garden right perfectly normal afternoon high above them in the sky there's

620
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:18,000
 a plane which is doing a training exercise with a real nuclear bomb where they have to transport

621
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:23,920
 it across the country um so training exercise there had been some kind of mess up with getting it

622
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:30,320
 sort of locked into its um its sort of um hangar thing you know it's hanging there above the

623
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:36,880
 bomb bay doors um so the captain sends a crew member to adjust the the locking mechanism the

624
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:42,240
 crew member uh can't quite get a handle these are huge bombs it looks like a you know it looks like

625
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:47,600
 a whale weighs about three tons the crew member climbs slightly up the side of the bomb and reaches

626
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:52,800
 up to grab something to get a handhold unfortunately what he grabs is the emergency bomb release

627
01:00:52,800 --> 01:01:00,800
 mechanism right oh and then does he fly down on it like in dr strange level so the exact well the

628
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:05,600
 bomb falls onto the bomb bay doors right which crumple like paper yeah the crew member makes

629
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:12,720
 an x shape with his body and just about stays inside the plane okay the bomb is now falling

630
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:19,760
 towards the completely unaware greg family house it lands in their garden it makes a crater 15 meters

631
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:26,000
 across and 10 meters deep the no one is killed the family are all injured but they they you know

632
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:31,680
 they became superheroes no they become superheroes um the family's chickens unfortunately were

633
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:35,920
 vaporized but the but thank god the bomb did not go fully nuclear it kind of had the

634
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:42,080
 safety catch on but then amazingly they stayed the the crew was so apologetic they were so

635
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:46,800
 mortified they'd done this and they wrote to the family apologizing and they stayed in touch for

636
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:52,720
 years with the crew this family the great even to the extent that one of them visited the family

637
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:59,360
 for a week's holiday many years later wow that's so nice that's incredible that must have been an

638
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:02,400
 embarrassing moment because i used to get embarrassed enough you know when you had to knock on your

639
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:08,640
 neighbor's door and say i'm really sorry i've kicked my football into your garden i am so sorry i have

640
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:14,640
 dropped my nuclear bomb in your backyard um in the vietnam war i don't think we've ever mentioned

641
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:21,840
 operation wandering soul have we which was one of the tactics that the us used against vietnamese

642
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:28,400
 soldiers which was to play ghost noises incredibly loudly out of helicopters and from u.s soldiers

643
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:33,280
 sort of hidden in vietnam they'd have these big boomboxes and play ghost noises that doesn't seem

644
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:39,200
 like it would work because helicopters are extremely loud and it's not like you're gonna

645
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:44,480
 they're not like they can sneak up on you and then play this noise you're going to be first thing

646
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:49,200
 is you hear the helicopter and you're going to go why a ghost driving helicopters now doesn't make

647
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:54,720
 any sense you're so right the idea was that in vietnam the belief is that if you don't get a

648
01:02:54,720 --> 01:03:00,480
 proper burial then your soul wanders the earth and so they actually recorded south vietnamese

649
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:04,480
 people they recruited south vietnamese people to record themselves shrieking and screaming and

650
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:09,440
 saying my friends i've come back to let you know that i am dead i'm dead don't end up like me go

651
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:15,440
 home quickly wow really crazy and the vietnamese soldiers mainly didn't believe them and all it

652
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:22,480
 did was give them a target to return fire to so oh no that would still scare me i have to say if

653
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:28,080
 if the four of us were out you know in a in a jungle and we were scared in a boombox had a voice of

654
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:35,120
 saying alex bell saying don't come over here i'm dead i get scared by that what situation why are we

655
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:42,240
 in the jungle then i mean what how badly wrong is our tour gone that way we're on foot in vietnamese

656
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:48,880
 jungle and why still alex bell yeah and why does it take a boombox and a helicopter and the jungle

657
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:57,120
 for you to pay any attention to alex bell alex if you're listening here's how you get us to

658
01:03:57,120 --> 01:04:02,800
 actually upload the podcast correctly when you say there there are all these museums around

659
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:07,840
 nice and some of them do sound i would say of limited interest so there's a museum there's an

660
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:15,440
 island called hi me hi me um and there's collector on there who's collection museum whatever you like

661
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:22,320
 it's a lifetime of paper napkins which are organized by theme into binders and for online

662
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:28,320
 her sofa is covered in binders full of paper napkins i just does anybody else feel an overwhelming

663
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:36,320
 sense of sadness well there's napkins there to wipe your tears away so yeah that's so true

664
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:41,360
 place to have a cry um they have a museum of sea monsters but the way that they've done that is

665
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:47,760
 they have the stories of sea monsters um like any museum might do but the founders they phoned

666
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:54,080
 every single care home in iceland and they asked for all of the elderly residents do you know any

667
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:59,200
 stories about sea monsters that have happened in your history or have you heard any stories

668
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:02,960
 and they collected all of those and they're all the stories that are in the museum which i think

669
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:09,520
 is a really good way of finding social history isn't it yeah so wonderful but that's the origin of

670
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:14,000
 of grim's fairy tales in the first place isn't it the grim brothers didn't write them they went

671
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:19,840
 around and collected them they really mostly from women yeah there's a woman i think she was called

672
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:26,880
 daughter wilder who gave lots of the stories but they went around and particularly older women

673
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:31,360
 asked them for the stories that they remember i mean really we ought to be doing more of that

674
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:37,840
 i think that that kind of gathering of stories is a wonderful thing so good for them that's great

675
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:42,720
 yeah it sounds wonderful it sounds like an incredible filing system but done as an entire

676
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:49,120
 country where they're all dedicated to filing one aspect to social history yeah it's just yeah

677
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:53,760
 it's incredible with the grim brothers i read a story which i really hope is true i always keep

678
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:57,520
 meaning to look it up which is when they were gathering the stories one of the brothers was

679
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:05,120
 trying to get a great story of a sailor or some guy who who knew a bunch and he said what can i

680
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:10,720
 give you to give me your story and the sailor needed new trousers so the grim brother gave

681
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:15,840
 his trousers on the spot to this guy to wear and then gave him his story and he took it down sort of

682
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:20,720
 you know trouserless as he was as he was taking it just love i love that kind of i need your story

683
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:25,920
 what do you need my trousers fine go for it did that wait did the guy did the guy who was talking

684
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:30,960
 to not have any trousers on no he was probably just was he approaching a trouserless man and say

685
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:36,320
 tell me your story i think a trouserless sailor there's another story there yeah wait was it the

686
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:44,960
 story of when he the poo i'm actually in Berlin there was a traffic jam this year that was in the

687
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:51,120
 news which was this is in february and this was created by one german artist who calls himself

688
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:57,200
 an artist called simon weckert who created a traffic jam by just pulling a handcart so he was

689
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:02,720
 on foot and pulling a handcart behind him carrying 99 phones so how google maps works is when it's

690
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:08,800
 giving you traffic updates it assesses all the number of phones in a certain area and then assumes

691
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:12,720
 that those are lots of people in cars and then assumes that that means there's a huge traffic jam

692
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:18,160
 so google assumed massive traffic jam on this one bridge and it redirected traffic around it

693
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:22,960
 and this guy was just him on his own walking through the centre of berlin he actually walked

694
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:27,440
 past google's offices just to do a sort of middle finger up to them i guess that must be so freaky

695
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:30,640
 for the guys at google they must say oh my god the traffic jam it's coming this way

696
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:39,520
 it's an invisible one they're the worst that's hilarious they they claim to be supportive google

697
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:45,760
 a google spokesperson said whether via car or cart or camel we love seeing creative uses of google

698
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:51,040
 maps as it helps us make our work better oh yeah doesn't sound like they really liked it and now

699
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:57,920
 that guy has been killed he's been disappeared won't find him on google maps anymore um one thing

700
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:04,720
 that's quite similar which is uh about modern technology and slightly hacking it is the old

701
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:10,880
 teslas um which would drive you could set them to drive just underneath the speed limit wherever

702
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:17,360
 you were um they would read the traffic signs and so researchers at mackafee realised that if you

703
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:23,120
 got a 35 mile per hour traffic sign and you got some black sticky tape and turned the three into an

704
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:33,120
 eight then your tesla would drive at 85 miles an hour in nine wow these are the old teslas and

705
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:38,400
 new ones don't do that anymore um i think possibly thanks to this little bit of um work by mackafee

706
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:43,520
 but it just i mean especially as a 35 mile an hour traffic signs are usually in places that

707
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:49,520
 need people to slow down it's yeah yeah and that's that's why we're still in the trialing stage really

708
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:56,560
 of the driverless cars isn't it like one smear on a speed sign and everyone dies have we ever talked

709
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:02,800
 about just that reminds me of the tree of tenoray which is in um always in i think Liberia but

710
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:08,400
 somewhere up there and um it was the most isolated tree in the world and there was no tree anywhere

711
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:13,360
 for like i don't know 100 miles in any direction and then it got knocked over by a libyan truck

712
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:19,840
 driver literally there's nothing else to and he just decided i'm just going to drive straight into

713
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:24,080
 that by accident that must have been like the scene in austin powers where the guy's being

714
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:28,880
 about to be run over by the steamroller and he's shouting no from about 20 meters away very very

715
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:34,880
 slowly do you think the guy the truck driver was similarly i don't see anything else i think that's

716
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:39,600
 a really unfair analogy because in austin powers the idiot is the person who's about to be run over

717
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:45,200
 so that implies you're blaming the tree and the tree's gone to extreme lengths to escape traffic

718
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:51,280
 collisions it's so socially distanced that tree it is i think what it is is there's something about

719
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:56,640
 people when they're driving if there's a massive area with nothing there at all but there's one

720
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:02,560
 thing then some reason you just kind of get drawn towards it like your brain just can't

721
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:08,240
 avoid it there there is a thing called target fixation isn't there where someone is so focused

722
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:12,000
 on avoiding a thing that they keep looking at the thing and aiming towards it accidentally the

723
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,680
 conversation equivalent is that thing which is in the meaning of lift where there's something

724
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:19,520
 you're trying to avoid talking about and so you can never avoid talking about it and i think the

725
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:23,680
 example that's given in that book is if you're talking to someone with one leg and you find

726
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:28,720
 your conversation is liberally peppered with references to long john silver or the last leg

727
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:35,360
 of the ua for competition it reminds me of um michael windsor who is now basal brushes pa

728
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:40,400
 jenny you're always you're always name dropping i am friends with basal brush aren't you that's why

729
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:48,160
 i'm friends with basal brush so the way he got the job was he rang up basal brushes creator's son

730
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:54,720
 as basal brush and auditioned for him during that you just just was in character the whole time

731
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:58,160
 did the voice perfectly got his mannerisms and he got the job

732
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:03,440
 phone call which is an absolutely bold move because yeah you've got the potential to really

733
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:09,360
 upset somebody who literally this guy sees basal brush as his brother that's how um that's how

734
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:14,720
 peter cellars as well got his first job peter cellars of inspector clue so fame and the goonshow

735
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:19,200
 and so on he was getting nowhere and he was an impressionist and he called up the bbc and he

736
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:25,120
 did an impression of the the head of the bbc at the time saying to the person who's the producer

737
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:32,080
 picking up going have you got this peter cellars not in american it's where's peter cellars where's

738
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:37,520
 this peter cellars guy hey this kid's hard i hear you've got to get him you've got to get him now

739
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:42,880
 so yeah say he imitated it and the guy went oh i'm so sorry well yeah we'll book him and peter

740
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:47,120
 cellars later admitted that was actually me but the guy was so impressed that's hilarious that's

741
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:51,680
 actually how rory bremnes still keeps getting jobs he can do a very good impression of the director

742
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:58,320
 general of the bbc that's not fair rory bremnes great i don't know why i said that do you know

743
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:05,760
 vanilla ice is real name oh i feel like i should um oh gosh i can't remember it's a piece called

744
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:14,080
 rob rob van winkel oh yeah anyway apparently why on earth would you change that i mean that's

745
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:20,480
 a fantastic name and also wait a minute it scans perfectly doesn't it rip van winkel

746
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:28,160
 he wouldn't have to do ice ice baby he's got you're absolutely right yeah he was called vanilla

747
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:31,840
 because he was the only one in his friendship group who was white and he got called that and

748
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:37,520
 then he had a dance move called the ice right i didn't i didn't know it was white i didn't know

749
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:44,480
 anything about it you're kidding he almost played london i think in 2019 or 2020 possibly yeah 2018

750
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:50,640
 or 2019 on ice it's going to be his first vanilla ice on ice no funster yeah and he sings a song

751
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:56,240
 where the lyrics are ice ice baby this guy has an obsession he's got a problem it's an issue

752
01:12:57,200 --> 01:13:03,040
 actually um like crowley has something in common with rex lambett uh founding editor of bbc's list

753
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:09,200
 the magazine is it that they were both insane i suppose so actually you'll get sued for that and

754
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:15,120
 this is about being sued as well so um allister crowley tried to sue a writer called nina hamnet

755
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:20,880
 for libel because she called him a black magician um she said he was into black magic and he said

756
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:26,640
 that this wasn't true and he tried to sue her and he lost and he was declared bankrupt and then

757
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:30,400
 towards the end basically he became a big drug addict because he'd taken a lot of drugs before

758
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:36,480
 and then he became a real drug addict and he died quite young um but i was reading about nina hamnet

759
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:42,880
 and according to wikipedia she was a welsh artist and writer who was an expert on sailor shanties

760
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:50,480
 and became known as the queen of bohemia she sounds incredible isn't she um she was basically um like

761
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:57,120
 one of the main people in soho around the 1930s who kind of knew absolutely everyone um she had

762
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:02,560
 an incredible bohemian life but actually when she sued crowley it became such big news that it really

763
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:09,920
 kind of wrecked her life and she became a bit of a alcoholic just walking around taverns in fitrovia

764
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:18,960
 trading anecdotes for drinks sad if you take on black magic you're always wins yeah um i was amazed

765
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:23,600
 about other people's connections to the occult around this time and people who i thought were

766
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:29,280
 just legit humans so the way crowley first got into this whole world was i think he joined

767
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:34,240
 an order which is called the hermetic order of the golden dawn and another leading figure in that

768
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:41,200
 was yate which as in wb yate and he was actually him and his partner more gone famously his sort of

769
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:47,920
 muse and also iin nesbit who wrote the samyard if anyone's read that um anyway like five children

770
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:52,960
 in it yeah exactly wow sort of makes sense when you think about it you can imagine someone who

771
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:59,200
 was into weirdo magic writing that yeah but yates was a chapter leader for this order and crowley

772
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:04,160
 didn't like him and there was this big rivalry going on about who should be ruling this chapel

773
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:09,440
 crowley or yates and eventually crowley invaded his chapel mid sermon he launched what he called

774
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:16,800
 an astral siege on the chapel which involved um kicking the doors down and he was wearing a kilt

775
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:22,160
 for some reason and a cyrus mask because it's by by egyptian mythology and he started casting

776
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:27,440
 spells and waving daggers around and the police had to come and break it up wow well yeah the big

777
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:31,920
 story of that it's called the battle of blithe road and the story is that he came through and he

778
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:37,760
 started propelling black magic at yates and the others as he was coming up the stairs yates was

779
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:42,800
 using white magic and the white magic toppled him over down the stairs now that's what they say

780
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:47,040
 but when you read into it what it actually was is he was coming up the stairs and yates

781
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:52,480
 and his buddy who was a boxer was kicking him back down the stairs is that what white magic is

782
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:58,080
 white magic is some big guy kicking you down the stairs yeah exactly he's one of the gladiators

783
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:05,680
 this is white magic but this this order the idea was they wanted to discover a unified theory that

784
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:11,280
 explained the magical world so that they could bring endless possibilities to magicians that

785
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:16,640
 was why they were set up and that's why yates joined he wanted to use it for good um and so

786
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:24,160
 he joined crowley and he had a mentor there and the name of his mentor alan bennett wow yeah how

787
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:28,080
 good i mean it's not actual alan bennett obviously i was summoning a demon yesterday

788
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:36,480
 um this year has had an exciting new naval battle which is great because you know not as many

789
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:40,800
 classic naval counters as there yeah definitely well i don't want to get old Jeremy carbon on your

790
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:46,000
 aster i promise this is a good one because this is the first naval battle in the caribbean for

791
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:53,520
 75 years um and it's between uh venezuela uh venezuelan naval patrol vessel which was doing the

792
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:58,880
 rounds um defending the motherland and so on and it had guns anti aircraft guns that machine guns

793
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:04,160
 mounted on the deck lots of stuff on the other side was a portuguese cruise ship uh which included

794
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:10,960
 an 80 seat theater a sauna and a jacuzzi okay the venezuelan patrol vessels as it said you're being

795
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:15,520
 very territorially aggressive or something they basically they were chanting her arm a bit

796
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:19,520
 they approached they ordered it to come into port uh in venezuela and you know surrender and all of

797
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:24,160
 this they then opened fire and then they rammed the ship okay they rammed the cruise ship but

798
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:28,000
 unfortunately they didn't realize that the cruise ship question the resolute was built for polar

799
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:35,360
 cruising and i had a one meter thick hull the venezuelan naval patrol vessel crumpled basically

800
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:45,120
 like a tin can 44 sailors had to be rescued unbelievably embarrassing wow yeah that must

801
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:50,640
 have really that must have really livened up that cruise ship cruise for the on board and and if you

802
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:55,920
 look out on your left you'll see the venezuelan navy and venezuela is now owned by thomas cuck is

803
01:17:55,920 --> 01:18:05,520
 that right that's right yeah amazing you know that there's a lot of art that just sits out at sea

804
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:13,120
 on private yachts that often are worth sort of two to three times the value of the yacht itself

805
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:20,000
 they're such valuable pieces of art so for example um joe louis has a 200 million pound super yacht he

806
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:25,440
 is the majority stakeholder of totland hot spurs the football club he is he's a very he's a billionaire

807
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:30,720
 in the uk and um he has a yacht and that moored and when it moored people could see through the

808
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:36,720
 window and they saw hanging inside one of the rooms a francis bacon painting that sold anonymously

809
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:41,840
 christies for 26 million pounds and so there's courses you can take now to train people for the

810
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:46,800
 practical care of onboard art collection because everyone on board doesn't know how to look after

811
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:52,880
 these you know so priceless pieces of art and they keep getting damaged when they're out at sea and

812
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:58,800
 you know someone will pour um someone will pop a champagne bottle and a cork might hit a priceless

813
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:04,080
 piece of art or in some cases there was one guy a john michelle basquiat who's an artist

814
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:07,520
 who has little bits of corn flakes that are hanging off the paintings and they were very

815
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:11,600
 worried that they were going to be ripped off thinking that maybe the kids on board had spilt

816
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:18,080
 their corn flakes onto the painting itself um you can't you can't spill corn flakes onto a painting

817
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:24,880
 that's hanging vertically on i don't know dad you've got kids how how far does the food fly

818
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:33,200
 when it gets spilt exactly you very much can but that the ceiling fresco at the back of them is

819
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:39,520
 just a ball of cocoa pops isn't it yeah i think if you're putting cereal on your paintings then

820
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:44,880
 you shouldn't have an automatic right that it's taken seriously yeah well apparently in this

821
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:48,720
 case it was a mistake he was eating corn flakes looking at his painting as he was laying on the

822
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:52,800
 floor and it fell on it and it became part of the art is what they say in this article

823
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:58,320
 but then one of the more famous ones is that um some millionaire or billionaire owners came back

824
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:03,840
 onto their yacht and they've been told by that the captain had unwrapped a piece of art that had

825
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:09,760
 arrived for them onto the yacht and had hung the painting on the wall and this was a horrific moment

826
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:14,160
 to hear it because the piece of art that they'd unwrapped was a bit of art done by christo and

827
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:21,200
 john claude and their way of doing art is they wrap things up so they just wrap stuff up and so

828
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:26,480
 effectively the captain had taken the actual art off put it into a room with all the hot pipes and

829
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:30,080
 then hung up this painting on the wall and you might know some of their work they did the the

830
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:34,480
 rice stag in berlin they they wrapped the entire that's what they do they just go around wrapping

831
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:39,200
 things so yeah so there's courses now for teaching you how to look after art on the high seas very

832
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:44,320
 good so funny god i bet after that there was a famous dog he was called don the talking dog

833
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:52,640
 and he was called the canine phenomenon phenomenon of the century he debuted in 1912

834
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:59,440
 and he had a vocabulary that reached eight words what words were they well please don't say rough

835
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:06,080
 and breathe back i think it was a bit like that they were all in german first of all

836
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:13,680
 he could say he could say harbin he could say kuchen he could which means cake and the first one

837
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:20,880
 means have uh he could say he could kind of say ja and nine and he could say ruha oh come on i need

838
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:27,120
 a i need a recording of this or i will not believe well he was really saying he was absolutely

839
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:32,240
 massive he was like he was when he came over to america so he was big in germany obviously like

840
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:37,040
 you're gonna be big in germany if you speak german but when he came over to america there was a lot

841
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:42,960
 of kind of german expats there and they were really excited and so they met him on the coming

842
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:48,720
 off the ship a load of reporters and asked him for a quote which his owner said he was too seasick

843
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:54,640
 to give a quote when he arrived but he was very impressed by new york but whenever he went on

844
01:21:54,640 --> 01:22:01,840
 stage he would kind of answer a series of questions presumably the answers were always harbin or kuchen

845
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:06,800
 or something like that but the point was that he would make noises that sound a bit like it but

846
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:12,320
 according to um the journal science someone did an actual paper on it they said that really he's

847
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:17,600
 only just making noises and it's the people in the audience that are interpreting it as words

848
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:21,200
 they sound a bit like words but obviously he doesn't really know what he's doing and it helps

849
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:27,200
 that the german language sounds quite a lot more like a dog barking than sort of the spanish language

850
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:31,280
 i mean you wouldn't get away with a big romantic language and a dog trying to impersonate that

851
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:36,960
 you're absolutely right when i don't understand a question or i can't quite um determine what the

852
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:44,720
 person said i give an answer that is uh in determined as well so it could be uh a sort of a mixture

853
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:49,600
 of yes and no or or i'm not sure so you know and because i don't know what the person said but i

854
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:54,640
 still want to respond because they're staring at me so i'll often say something like oh and

855
01:22:58,160 --> 01:23:04,560
 and they and they go are you sure and i'll go uh so that's just a little hint there for some people

856
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:10,480
 you might want to it's a little little skill you can have that's sort of a halfway noise in russian

857
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:19,120
 you can say yes no yes no which means no dan yet means no right as well and you see how we have a

858
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:25,200
 term called oh yeah nah oh yeah probably heard of this one that's right yeah yeah so when people

859
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:31,760
 say you go into the beach oh yeah nah and you what does that mean does that mean yes on well it means

860
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:37,040
 you might but you just see how you go oh okay and they might say to you are you into it have

861
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:42,080
 you seen this thing are you into it oh yeah you know you could be but you don't want to give it away

862
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:47,360
 so it's a wonderful response because and then you can't you can't actually

863
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:53,440
 respond again to that by law in new zealand so if you've received an oh yeah nah you can't go

864
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:56,960
 look which is it because then you're just you're shunned i suppose you could just you could just

865
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:02,720
 say maybe i guess it's a similar word no because then you're really giving it away that you're

866
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:09,840
 not sure okay yeah all right it's not right yeah nah is is is the full spectrum okay very non-committal

867
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:14,240
 country an entire country that's terrified of commitment that's actually that's actually an

868
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:22,000
 option that's actually an option on the upcoming election ballot isn't it it is yeah yes no oh yeah

869
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:29,360
 nah now even though it ends on nah this the the year part is going to be strong oh yeah no

870
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:34,320
 oh really the way you say it well it is yeah there's different ways of saying it so i don't

871
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:39,200
 assume it meant no in the end the one you end on seems to be the dominant one ask me ask me whether

872
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:46,560
 it does oh does it just mean no right great should we get back to talking dogs

873
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:55,280
 and the breath actually can be a problem in some places like the edvard monk museum in norway

874
01:24:55,280 --> 01:25:01,040
 they say that the scream is fading the screen which is his most famous work is fading because of

875
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:06,320
 people's breath and that's because he used very cheap low quality paint he used cadmium sulfide

876
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:12,240
 paints monk when he did his painting and it means that when you breathe on it it kind of gets worse

877
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:15,760
 and worse and worse and they're trying to stop people from breathing and that means they should

878
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:22,880
 they should replace it with the screen yeah the screen in front of the screen yeah very nice

879
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:30,880
 sorry it was too good that i didn't like one of those ones i was afraid to breathe in front of

880
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:39,600
 it in case in case the joke faded to the car should we um we can stop there actually

881
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:46,320
 should we cast it yeah let's do that that was a great one no no it's fine i was only going to

882
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:51,360
 talk about um taser tampons we could let's talk about taser tampons quickly yeah and then we

883
01:25:51,360 --> 01:26:00,480
 can move on after that i read the press store so some modern uh self-defense gadgets that obviously

884
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:05,680
 it's still a bit of a growth area even though a lot of these things get released and they're not

885
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:12,000
 legal to carry so there is a killer engagement ring with a particularly sharp cut diamond

886
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:17,920
 an unbreakable umbrella which waks just as strong as a steel pipe but weighs only one pound and 11

887
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:25,520
 ounces i think my favorite is the pink stinger which is a stun gun made to look like a tampon

888
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:32,960
 it can deliver a 50 000 volt shock and can be used handheld or shot out to distances up to 14 feet

889
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:38,000
 so that's that's a heck of a tampon i think i've seen that done in thailand actually um

890
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:48,880
 so no but you don't wear it as a tampon before you fire it at your it's like a pink ball thing

891
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:54,640
 no it's it's to be hidden within your handbag and nobody would know not presumably among your

892
01:26:54,640 --> 01:27:00,240
 other tampons yeah you don't want to accidentally get the wrong one do you yeah although if you've

893
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:03,840
 got enemies and they ask for a tampon in the bathroom that's a hell of a prank

894
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:05,680
 prank

895
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:16,320
 50 000 volt prank prank goes wrong man doesn't understand what a prank is

896
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:24,240
 lovely wow that's extraordinary those are all on the market we can yeah they're they're available

897
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:29,520
 somewhere and i cannot guarantee that they are legal in in the territory in which you're currently

898
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:35,200
 listening so please don't waste your money i got one last thing which is i was i like the idea of

899
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:40,240
 the name center for north dakota so i just quickly looked into other names of north dakota to see if

900
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:46,080
 there's any fun names and i found there's a place called flasher which is great in north dakota place

901
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:52,800
 called zap and zap kind of the only major thing i could find that happened there was in 1969 there

902
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:58,560
 was a movement called zip to zap where the mayor of zap suddenly found two to three thousand partiers

903
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:01,280
 tearing up the streets and setting bonfires in the middle of them

904
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:06,240
 to have this big party and they had to get the national garden to push them out

905
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:10,880
 why was that called zip to zap i thought you were going to say the mayor zip wired into zap

906
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:18,080
 no i think it was just a group of people that let's zip over to zap and have a massive party

907
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:23,760
 is the uh i believe and then lastly a place called buttsville which is a cool name

908
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:31,520
 but that is weird there's a lot of butts in um in that part of the world isn't there because um

909
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:38,960
 butts like means uh it's like a raised bit of land or something so there's but yeah so in

910
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:44,160
 montana and wyoming and dakota's there's loads of butts you're not going to believe this in south

911
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:50,080
 dakota there is a place which was the original center of north america which was done by drawing

912
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:56,880
 two lines and it is called snake butt really yeah and they put an obelisk on it uh and they

913
01:28:56,880 --> 01:29:02,240
 named it the approximate center of north america and um then in 1930 they changed their minds and

914
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:07,200
 decided it was in rugby north dakota but it was snake butt a confusing name because it's actually

915
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:15,280
 really hard to work out where a snake's butt is really is do you know what i said i was having a

916
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:20,160
 look so i was going looking through some old books and uh maybe this is just me having sort of

917
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:24,080
 locked down brain but i suddenly had a look at one of the poo and i hadn't realized quite how

918
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:27,440
 philosophical it is so there's a wonderful bit where piglet and poo are sitting underneath the

919
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:34,640
 big tree and piglet says what if this big tree falls down and poo says what if it doesn't and i

920
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:40,240
 just thought it's a great attitude to life isn't it instead of catastrophizing and thinking what

921
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:44,720
 if this terrible thing happens i like that attitude i mean or am i being ridiculous and

922
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:49,680
 we don't know you're right i have to say it sounds like poo is praying for an end to the pain there

923
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:55,200
 it sounds like he's taking piglet there on the assumption the tree will fall on them both

924
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:59,840
 but i really like that why are we always worrying about the bad thing that's going to happen what

925
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:20,960
 if yeah what if it doesn't we just sit here happily and not worry about bad things happening to it
