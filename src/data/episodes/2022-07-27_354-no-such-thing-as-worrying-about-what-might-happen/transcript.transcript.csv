00:01:19,00:01:34,Happy New Year on with a podcast
00:01:34,00:01:42,hey guys you've got a quick quiz question if the date is Wednesday the 31st of December
00:01:43,00:01:50,are you in the last week of the year yes yes that is incorrect you're in the first week of the year
00:01:50,00:01:56,so I'm afraid you're all have to leave what could not be in both no of course you can't be in both
00:01:56,00:02:00,what do you mean it's Wednesday the 31st of December you're in the last no but the week's
00:02:00,00:02:04,different isn't it because it's it's more heavy set on the other side of the week in days if it
00:02:04,00:02:10,was on a scale it would weigh over to the the new year week wouldn't it dan's describing better what
00:02:10,00:02:16,the international organization for standardization describes in terms of how to refer to weeks so
00:02:16,00:02:21,you know across the world we have to have the same definition of week one week two week three of a
00:02:21,00:02:28,year and the week week I gotta say I'm without the other side look the week week's up to start on a
00:02:28,00:02:32,Monday and we've got to have the same week so that trading and business internationally globally
00:02:32,00:02:37,works so there's an international body that decides what week one is and the definition of
00:02:37,00:02:42,week one of the year is the week with the year's first Thursday in it so if the first of January
00:02:42,00:02:48,is a Thursday then week one actually starts on the 29th of December which is that Monday right so
00:02:48,00:02:53,week one is that so if the 31st of December is on a Wednesday then you're actually in week one
00:02:53,00:02:58,of the next year because that's insane you can't have week one beginning two days before the year
00:02:58,00:03:02,ends I'm sorry it's absolutely no one does things in weeks anyway you do things in quarters
00:03:04,00:03:09,when it happens like that Anna always has her New Year's party on Sunday the 28th of December don't
00:03:09,00:03:16,it's an absolutely banging event with me me and my cat in attendance I'm sorry you guys have never
00:03:16,00:03:22,been able to make it just very quickly what number Archbishop of Paris do you reckon André
00:03:22,00:03:30,Ventois is is is he the current 23rd 22nd as far as I can tell he's the 30th
00:03:31,00:03:39,so that's his actual name André Ventois and he yeah he was born with the surname 23 and the
00:03:39,00:03:46,the best guess is that it was because and a sort of ancestor of his was found and adopted and they
00:03:46,00:03:52,were found on the 23rd of a month and so they were given that surname yeah so but as far as I can
00:03:52,00:03:56,tell he's the 30th there's there's a lot of breaks in their archbishops over the years so there might
00:03:56,00:04:05,be a few that are not in there hey what's Archbishop Ventois favourite band I don't know Andy what is
00:04:05,00:04:13,Archbishop Ventois favourite band Eiffel 65 and it's because they have a French name and then a
00:04:13,00:04:20,number oh really what well Eiffel Eiffel no no I do understand that yeah and he's French and he
00:04:20,00:04:27,has a number in his name you know what their favourite punk band is I don't know it's Blink 182
00:04:27,00:04:32,and that's because French people blink like the rest of us and there's a there's a number following
00:04:32,00:04:39,that I really think we should move this on I've got to get out of here what is Archbishop Ventois
00:04:39,00:04:49,favourite album by Adele there's a few options there 21 because he's called 23 and it's just another
00:04:49,00:05:00,number yeah yes very interesting he prepares it to the original 19 yeah are all of Adele's albums
00:05:00,00:05:07,numbered yeah oh mate yes yeah 19 that is the age she was when actually it's actually not the ages
00:05:07,00:05:12,anymore they've become untethered from her age but yeah I thought I was thinking she can't have
00:05:12,00:05:26,released 23 albums okay there's an Indian loser called Shiva Keshavan and he has been a true victim
00:05:26,00:05:33,of the Indian government's low prioritising of various olympic sports he it's you can understand
00:05:33,00:05:39,why the Indian government isn't prioritising the loot look no think about the Himalayas think about
00:05:39,00:05:44,the pre low territory you've got for looting I was just thinking that Sean Connery would be a good
00:05:44,00:05:52,luge manager like coach because he'd be like you're a looser you're a looser and all the SH's Sean
00:05:52,00:06:01,Connery's both got Shiva Keshavan you're a looser but so he had to train on wheels not in a proper
00:06:01,00:06:06,looge thing because that's normally on ice isn't it the looge he had to make a sled basically with
00:06:06,00:06:11,wheels on and just train on busy roads just going downhill in the Himalayas and he had there's
00:06:11,00:06:16,there's footage of him dodging a herd of goats which is in the middle of the road and he has
00:06:16,00:06:22,sort of frantically looge around you know um old mcdonald had a farm very well did you got familiar
00:06:22,00:06:32,yeah yeah eio well the earliest version we have was actually old mcdoogle had a farm eio and there's
00:06:32,00:06:39,an even earlier version which is not about a farm but it's old Missouri had a mule he high he high
00:06:39,00:06:46,ho and every country around the world has its own version of old mcdonald and they're all on
00:06:46,00:06:56,wikipedia of course so in turkish it's Ali Baba has a farm eio in swedish it's Per Olson has a farm
00:06:56,00:07:06,eio and in Serbian it's svakoyutro jedno jaje organismus nagudaje which means
00:07:06,00:07:16,one egg a day gives the strength to human organism wow they've just gone completely random i don't
00:07:16,00:07:21,understand that at all every other country in the world it's about someone having a farm and they're
00:07:21,00:07:26,just like don't eat your eggs when planes are actually just coming into land as a normal procedure
00:07:26,00:07:31,the way it works is that they have to get ready miles before they even see where the airport is
00:07:31,00:07:35,they got to get to a certain height and then there's a couple of things that they have to either see
00:07:35,00:07:39,they've got to either have eyes on the runway or the lights that they can see coming from it to
00:07:39,00:07:45,know that they're at the right height and it's actually the computer on board the airline that
00:07:45,00:07:49,makes them make a snap decision about whether or not they were able to land or if they're at the
00:07:49,00:07:54,wrong bit so as they're getting ready to that moment the computer will just yell out in the cockpit
00:07:54,00:08:02,decide that's all they get she goes decide and then they go yes we're doing it or they have to pull
00:08:02,00:08:12,out it sounds like a tv quiz show and now it's time to decide oh you would have won a speedboat but
00:08:12,00:08:20,you've died in a blink that's amazing do they get warning is there a sort of i'm gonna have to
00:08:20,00:08:25,have to hurry you here your time to think i hope you've made up your mind because in a minute
00:08:25,00:08:31,you're going to have to decide and then if they go for it it goes oh interesting decision
00:08:31,00:08:36,we'll come back after the break to see if you've made the right call
00:08:36,00:08:43,there is a problem with being in the center of america someone found out there's this massive
00:08:43,00:08:49,problem that was generated for someone who lives quite near the center of the us in fact
00:08:49,00:08:54,and this is to do with a company called maxmind have you read about this story about ip addresses
00:08:54,00:09:00,okay so it's so weird basically uh maxmind is this company who about sort of just over 10 years ago
00:09:00,00:09:05,started calculating the location of loads of ip addresses so you know with your computer you've
00:09:05,00:09:09,got an ip address maxmind figured out whereabouts they all were geographically and then it could
00:09:09,00:09:14,sell that information to companies like google and facebook and lots of other people um but often
00:09:14,00:09:18,when you're trying to work out where an ip address is you can't get it exact and sometimes it'll just
00:09:18,00:09:24,say this is somewhere in america or somewhere in the us and so for all of those maxmind just
00:09:24,00:09:29,default assumed that they were in the middle so they got the coordinates of roughly the middle
00:09:29,00:09:35,of america and said okay all the ip addresses that we can't quite place they just are here
00:09:35,00:09:41,and it turns out here is a rural farmhouse belonging to someone called joce taylor who now
00:09:41,00:09:48,has 600 million ip addresses registered to her farmhouse and it's it's a complete disaster because
00:09:48,00:09:53,basically if there's a troll online or if there's someone who's hacked your company or if there's
00:09:53,00:09:57,someone doing criminal activity online and the police are tracking them down they chase up their
00:09:57,00:10:02,ip address and they constantly find it's at joce taylor's farmhouse and she's just inundated with
00:10:02,00:10:08,kind of abuse and people writing her threatening letters and had no idea why for about eight years
00:10:08,00:10:12,she was just like why am i being oh no what's happening to me are we definitely journalist
00:10:12,00:10:17,tracked her down are we definitely discounting the fact that joce is like a massive cyber
00:10:17,00:10:24,criminal is that she's she's a criminal mastermind an 82 year old criminal mastermind it's possible
00:10:24,00:10:33,that's funny oh poor joce choice and apparently the verne scholars refer to the novel as around
00:10:33,00:10:40,the world in 80 days and the play as around the world in 80 days but with 80 the digits so that's
00:10:40,00:10:46,how you can tell the difference be honest i didn't get that from when you were reading it out i saw
00:10:46,00:10:51,the fatal flaw in transferring this visual thing in front of me to the audio medium really we're
00:10:51,00:10:56,really hoping you're going to say around the world in 80 plays was what they called the play he wasn't
00:10:56,00:11:03,that smart a guy you know people claim he was you know you know mitten crabs is if you catch one
00:11:03,00:11:10,is there always a string attached to another mitten crab on the other hand uh the cia they
00:11:10,00:11:14,collected a load of jokes in the selviet union in the 80s that was one of the things they did and
00:11:14,00:11:19,that got declassified quite recently um we're not quite sure why they did it but it might have been
00:11:19,00:11:24,a way to kind of gauge what people were thinking in the selviet union or maybe a way of undermining
00:11:24,00:11:30,the government or stuff so they found stuff like um there are two men waiting in a line to buy vodka
00:11:30,00:11:35,the first man says i've had enough save my place i'm going to shoot gorbachev two hours later he
00:11:35,00:11:40,returns to claim his place in the line his friend said did you get him and the man replies no the
00:11:40,00:11:46,line there was even longer than the line here that's a good joke it's not bad is it a man goes into a
00:11:46,00:11:52,shop a man goes into a shop and says you don't have any meat do you um no replies to sales lady
00:11:52,00:11:57,we don't have any fish it's a star across the street that doesn't have any meat again that's
00:11:57,00:12:02,good it works doesn't it i think that's really good yeah yeah were they planning on distributing
00:12:02,00:12:08,the big book of cia jokes about your country feels like it doesn't it my favourite person to have
00:12:08,00:12:13,sort of an olympic korea career and then a follow-up is a guy called uh ross rebagliati he was the
00:12:13,00:12:18,first person ever to win gold at the winter olympics in snowboarding which was in 1998
00:12:18,00:12:24,and it was really sad for him because he won gold and then he was drugs tested and they found cannabis
00:12:24,00:12:30,in his system and so he was immediately had his gold rescinded he was put in jail for maybe importing
00:12:30,00:12:35,it into japan i think which is where the olympics were and then within about 72 hours they then gave
00:12:35,00:12:39,the gold medal back because they went actually cannabis is not on our list of banned substances
00:12:39,00:12:45,as it was not back then um but he insisted that it was from secondhand smoke uh you know he hadn't
00:12:45,00:12:51,smoked weed for almost a year and it was nothing to do with him he was furious but he has now gone
00:12:51,00:12:58,on to found a company called legacy brands a cbd and cannabis consumables company and has a series
00:12:58,00:13:04,of different strains of weed named after him so that's that's his job now and since he wasn't
00:13:04,00:13:09,stoned then but he's stoned all the time now i guess you can never guess what's going to happen
00:13:09,00:13:15,can you because the the 1984 olympics promotion by mcdonald's about uh you could get a free item
00:13:15,00:13:20,off the menu every time the us team got on the podium uh i don't know what you got big mac for
00:13:20,00:13:24,gold or something fries for something or something um they didn't expect the soviet union to drop out
00:13:24,00:13:32,of the olympics so many american national anthem was playing all the time and uh there was i think
00:13:32,00:13:38,there was even a shortage of hamburger buns because people got so many so you've got to be
00:13:38,00:13:43,careful what you uh what you offer up i think yeah at any olympics saying that about team usa
00:13:43,00:13:50,is not quite cool oh you're right you want to make it team togo just be super cautious yeah
00:13:50,00:13:56,the danish basketball team i think you're gonna make it quite nation specific jamaica winter
00:13:56,00:14:02,olympics they had one year where it looked a bit dodgy quite a few burgers but otherwise you say
00:14:02,00:14:08,one more thing um just that you can bite so i think you were talking at the start about how
00:14:08,00:14:13,audio stuff can also maybe trigger um with hallucinations or change your brain makeup and
00:14:13,00:14:18,actually they have now invented headphones which i think either on the market now they're coming
00:14:18,00:14:24,onto the market soon which send electrical impulses into your brain and they cause it to release more
00:14:24,00:14:29,like dopamine and serotonin and oxytocin like happiness hormones essentially and they're called
00:14:29,00:14:34,i think they're called nirvana headphones so they stimulate the vagus nerve in your brain
00:14:34,00:14:39,apparently which then releases all those neurotransmitters and they'll do it in time to the beat of
00:14:39,00:14:44,the music you're listening to so you could even be listening to the verb or something but you'd be
00:14:44,00:14:52,over the moon oh unnecessary burn on the verb i love the verb but they're not upbeat yeah but
00:14:52,00:14:59,i've heard that they've tried that but the drugs don't work so it's hey there was wasn't there a
00:14:59,00:15:08,big clash in east berlin about updating the traffic light men because really that yeah the the east
00:15:08,00:15:14,had particular traffic light men and they were called ample menschen i think which is that literally
00:15:14,00:15:19,means exactly that the traffic light man and one of the things that was proposed is replacing all
00:15:19,00:15:24,of them and people in east berlin particularly said no we really we really like these particular
00:15:24,00:15:28,traffic lights it's sort of a something very recognizable very iconic about the south of the
00:15:28,00:15:32,city and so those i think were rolled out and in fact this is not useful for anyone at home but we
00:15:32,00:15:41,have one in a jar just here oh that's what this is about for right okay let's see it can we see it
00:15:41,00:15:48,okay yeah yeah it's here so this is a little tin of tea this is the ample man yeah and you'll recognize
00:15:48,00:15:54,the stop and the go you know what his yeah the go man looks a bit like an old monopoly man kind of
00:15:54,00:15:59,thing because that doesn't be yeah we've all seen lots of these right these are these are in
00:15:59,00:16:03,berlin well it's a big souvenir thing in berlin now yeah yeah but also on the traffic lights is the
00:16:03,00:16:07,noticeable thing exactly where you see a traffic light go and you're like i mean they're all the
00:16:07,00:16:12,souvenirs but they were well they were kept that's the that's sort of the point yeah yeah they're
00:16:12,00:16:17,really cool they're much more jaunty mmm i'm just not sure that show and tell is ever going to work
00:16:17,00:16:27,as a podcast but it works when you had your own time so maybe the american dairy association has
00:16:27,00:16:32,a page on its website called famous cows of the world and it's a good read there are a whole
00:16:32,00:16:37,bunch of cows on there but my favorite was elm farm ollie do you guys know about elm farm ollie
00:16:37,00:16:45,well neither did i but it was the first cow to fly and also the uh when i say fly i should be clear
00:16:45,00:16:52,it's the first clown to ride in an aeroplane clown so it was a clown as well as a cow it's a
00:16:52,00:17:00,clown cow must have had massive shoes had a red nose and huge shoes i've lost it it was the first
00:17:00,00:17:09,cow to take a flight and it was the first cow to be milked mid-flight this was in Missouri in 1930
00:17:09,00:17:14,and it you know all these things have some kind of spurious scientific justification and so the
00:17:14,00:17:19,justification for this when they paid huge amounts of money to take it up was they wanted to observe
00:17:19,00:17:24,the mid-air and high altitude effect on animals in flight of their milking and of their milk and
00:17:24,00:17:29,it turns out it didn't make a difference to the milk but oh there was a farmer called bunts
00:17:29,00:17:34,else with bunts who milked her who then also became the first person to milk a cow mid-flight
00:17:34,00:17:41,so a huge sequence of first for elm farm ollie yeah it's good to be the one who's milking elm
00:17:41,00:17:46,farm ollie because if you if you ask you to smell her flower it's always going to be milk that squirts
00:17:46,00:17:53,out of it into your mouth okay that's it dad do you want to try it that a punch line to that
00:17:53,00:18:01,punch yeah i'd like to see you try it dad the master is smoking possibly told that
00:18:01,00:18:08,has wonky shut down now yeah has it what no it had new management a few years ago
00:18:08,00:18:13,i've definitely had it in the last year i can guarantee they don't do that kind of rude service
00:18:13,00:18:17,anymore they don't do the rude service uh all their trip advisor reviews went down hill slightly
00:18:17,00:18:21,after they stopped being rude to the customers because that was part of the experience they're
00:18:21,00:18:26,like three stars the guy was really nice to me he gave me my meal it was amazing i went there once
00:18:26,00:18:31,and we sat down on the table it was me and three other people and then halfway through the meal
00:18:31,00:18:35,literally halfway through the meal we went oh we need this table now you need to go upstairs
00:18:35,00:18:40,and they took all my stuff and made us sit on a much smaller table upstairs while they put other
00:18:40,00:18:46,people on our table wow i had a meal there with top davis who is uh people will know him on tv as
00:18:46,00:18:51,king gary and a few other tv shows and we went there and they put us on a big round table where
00:18:51,00:18:57,there was an entire family sitting and we had an old grandmother sitting in between us we weren't
00:18:57,00:19:03,even next to each other on the table oh it was wonderful great days wonkeys anyway our podcast
00:19:03,00:19:06,yeah back to the podcast
00:19:06,00:19:18,do you guys know about the debonish fibs family no you know well they're an uh extremely prominent
00:19:18,00:19:26,family in a sense in that their names are all over park benches across the uk and so this started
00:19:26,00:19:30,to be spotted about 10 years ago maybe a bit more and there are sort of park benches with you know
00:19:30,00:19:36,there's plaques on in memory of and they're always in memory of someone debonish fibs so for instance
00:19:36,00:19:40,in darmouth park near where i used to live there's one that was in memory of winter debonish fibs
00:19:40,00:19:47,and it said like to have everything just so and then the plaque was at a lopsided angle and there
00:19:47,00:19:52,was there was another one somewhere which was in memory of barbara debonish fibs whose wish was
00:19:52,00:19:58,to have a bench plaque inscribed with her last words unfortunately her last words were and then
00:19:58,00:20:05,it's a series of expectives the asterisk that's really funny currently scientists are trying to
00:20:05,00:20:13,find out uh who killed the dodo with a ct scanner whoa there was more than one dodo though that's
00:20:13,00:20:20,true but yes no that's true what do you mean though so do you mean like a specific one or is it i do
00:20:20,00:20:26,mean a specific one there's a dodo in oxford's museum of natural history and uh it's a celebrity
00:20:26,00:20:30,dodo actually although these days all dodo's are celebrities but um this is the one that
00:20:30,00:20:34,lewis carol may have seen when he was writing alice in wonderland and it might have inspired the
00:20:34,00:20:41,dodo in that but scientists thought that it had been killed uh some some way or that it had died
00:20:41,00:20:45,of natural causes actually because they thought it would be brought to uk threw it on a bonfire or
00:20:45,00:20:49,something i thought they destroyed it yeah well they've still got the skull all right that's the
00:20:49,00:20:54,main thing and so they they put the skull in a ct scanner and they found it didn't have natural
00:20:54,00:21:00,causes it was shot in the head with a shotgun so that is the opposite of natural causes um
00:21:00,00:21:04,and what they're trying to do now they've got a little bit of the lead that kind of impacted
00:21:04,00:21:09,with the back of the skull and they're trying to find out what country the lead from those shotgun
00:21:09,00:21:14,pellets was mined in and then they're going to try and find out where the shot was made from that
00:21:14,00:21:19,lead and they basically they're on the longest cold case ever where they're trying to find out 400
00:21:19,00:21:26,years later who pulled the trigger wow oh gosh what are they gonna do if prison is great great great
00:21:26,00:21:30,great grandchildren yeah exactly they're gonna get a knock on their door where are you on the fourth
00:21:30,00:21:39,of march 1596 it's just i was just looking into the quirks of iceland the country um i didn't know
00:21:39,00:21:47,this beer was banned there until 1989 really it was banned in 1915 they had a referendum and they
00:21:47,00:21:53,decided to ban beer and then in 1921 they had to change it a bit they legalized wine because
00:21:53,00:21:59,spain threatened to stop buying iceland's fish if iceland kept on refusing to import spanish wine
00:21:59,00:22:05,so they said okay i'm gonna have some wine and then they they allowed very very weak beer but they
00:22:05,00:22:10,didn't allow normal strength beer and this backfired badly because people just started putting vodka
00:22:10,00:22:16,into their incredibly weak beer and making a kind of horrible beer and vodka cocktail oh some of that
00:22:16,00:22:19,some of the spirits that you get in iceland are unbelievable i went to there's a restaurant that
00:22:19,00:22:28,specializes in slightly sort of quirky food and i ordered the fermented chuck and it comes in a jar
00:22:28,00:22:33,sealed kilner jar with a rubber thing and a very very strong glass of what are we called a schnapps
00:22:33,00:22:40,i don't know what you call it it's a very strong um pure alcohol thing uh and uh i said to the guy
00:22:40,00:22:46,i didn't order the schnapps he said you're going to need and you because for the sake of the other
00:22:46,00:22:50,diners you have to open the jar really really quickly and grab a little spoonful of this stuff
00:22:50,00:22:56,and stick it in your mouth and close it because it smells so terrible and the taste was the most
00:22:56,00:23:01,disgusting thing i've ever had it burned back at my throat and i and i did take a take the schnapps
00:23:01,00:23:07,as a shot i drank it so quickly anything to make the taste of the fermented shot go away
00:23:07,00:23:11,really thought you were going to turn around and say the amazing thing is it smells awful but the
00:23:11,00:23:18,taste is disgusting no it smells awful and also tastes awful correct um hey one bit of royal etiquette
00:23:18,00:23:24,which i think is um upheld in the royal family as opposed to being upheld by the tabloid press
00:23:24,00:23:29,is eating etiquette which is that and it doesn't it makes sense so the queen is served first you
00:23:29,00:23:33,would serve the queen first at a dinner and then when she stops eating really you're supposed to
00:23:33,00:23:40,stop eating as well and this has existed for a few hundred years and it was really difficult
00:23:40,00:23:44,with queen victoria because this was the practice then as well but queen victoria the thing about
00:23:44,00:23:50,her was she was incredibly greedy she used to eat extremely fast like her advisors used to say
00:23:50,00:23:56,stop eating so fast she got terrible indigestion she could eat seven courses in half an hour apparently
00:23:56,00:24:01,and she was always served first and so the people who were served last by the time they got their
00:24:01,00:24:05,plates they were sort of immediately whipped away from them again because queen victoria had
00:24:05,00:24:11,inhaled her first course i gotta say anna we've been for dinner quite a lot of times and you will
00:24:11,00:24:17,not let a plate go if there's any food left on it no matter whose plate it was yeah is this why
00:24:17,00:24:22,you've never met the queen because it's i did it once and i've been banned from dining with the queen
00:24:22,00:24:26,since desperately trying to lick everyone's plates is that it was taken away i had a quick look at
00:24:26,00:24:33,some things that you could get sent to prison for in finland oh yeah in 2015 the police asked
00:24:33,00:24:40,the members of the public that if they saw a pizza that was on sale for under six euros to inform the
00:24:40,00:24:48,police the way that they saw it is it's impossible to run a business where you sell pizzas for less
00:24:48,00:24:53,than six euros it's just the ingredients are too much it's completely impossible so if people are
00:24:53,00:24:58,doing that it means that they can't be paying the tax on the pizza which means that they must
00:24:58,00:25:04,be tax avoiders uh and so they asked literally asked people to say as soon if you see any pizza
00:25:04,00:25:10,on sale for underneath that price send us the menu and we'll arrest the guys that's so funny
00:25:10,00:25:14,that is a bargain price for a whole pizza yeah it is really unless you're in a shop in a shop
00:25:14,00:25:20,it's the kind of normal price for a shop pizza that's a very very posh shop pizza really isn't it
00:25:20,00:25:24,but i mean there are pizzas around the corner that you can take away delicious for a fiver
00:25:24,00:25:29,and i'm now wondering if it's my responsibility to be informing on them just tell the police in
00:25:29,00:25:34,finland because obviously the taxes in finland are a bit higher than they are in the uk so
00:25:34,00:25:39,probably it's more of a seven pound thing in the uk oh you feel bad if you got the whole
00:25:39,00:25:46,stuff and structure of the co-op sent to finish prison what are you in for i'm also in for selling
00:25:46,00:25:55,this pizza there's the pizza wing isn't there they're hard and criminals i went on ebay um to
00:25:55,00:26:00,look at what the most expensive items currently on ebay are that you can buy that are related to
00:26:00,00:26:07,lincoln did you find the horse hair yes so good so there's a look of hair there's a look of hair
00:26:07,00:26:15,from uh the horse you rode in the 1860 election called old bob and um old bob attended his funeral
00:26:15,00:26:21,and for just one thousand two hundred and fifty dollars you can buy a hair of this horse
00:26:21,00:26:27,one hair yeah actually yeah it's not a long strand one hair a single hair yeah you wouldn't
00:26:27,00:26:31,like if you open the envelope that could just fall onto the carpet and you've lost it if you're a
00:26:31,00:26:36,mafioso and you don't have the resources to put a whole horse's head on someone's pillow i'm just
00:26:36,00:26:42,thinking that you know as a middle-aged man who's losing his hair it shouldn't i shouldn't be letting
00:26:42,00:26:46,it go down the drain i should be saving this in case i become president or like the president's
00:26:46,00:26:50,also something in the future i don't know surely this is our next tour match park inside
00:26:50,00:26:58,i've got just one last thing about sort of ingenious ways of catching poachers people
00:26:58,00:27:04,who are trying to illegally catch all of these fish um during the early 80s to about 1998 there
00:27:04,00:27:10,was a guy who worked for the california u.s fish and wildlife service and his name was terry gross
00:27:10,00:27:15,and he was sort of sick of the fact that there were poachers that would go in the early morning
00:27:15,00:27:20,to catch all this salmon when that was highly illegal so you usually had to stop half an hour
00:27:20,00:27:23,after sunset and they would drive out at two or three in the morning and they would get away
00:27:23,00:27:28,with it because the tracks that were leading to all of these lakes were monitored by other poachers
00:27:28,00:27:32,so if they saw a truck come down that they knew was one of the wardens they would say quickly get
00:27:32,00:27:37,the boat in get out of there so they had plenty of warning so he had no idea what to do but then
00:27:37,00:27:43,he came up with this idea of putting on a wetsuit getting into the water before the day ended
00:27:43,00:27:48,and waiting patiently and what he would do is while they were fishing salmon he would loosen
00:27:48,00:27:53,the glove of his wetsuit and as they were fishing it would hook onto his glove and he would slowly
00:27:53,00:27:57,splash around and they would start going oh my god i've caught a massive salmon and he would go
00:27:57,00:28:01,harder and harder and they're like this is the biggest salmon we've ever got they've got this on
00:28:01,00:28:06,recording these words and they would slowly come in and they would get to him and as they got right
00:28:06,00:28:11,up to him he would say good morning gentlemen state fish and game warden you're under arrest
00:28:11,00:28:16,and he would pull out he would pull out of his wetsuit a citation book and he would give them
00:28:16,00:28:23,their fides and then he would go back in and try and catch more people and hire a glass mpr and this
00:28:23,00:28:28,american life um looked into it and they found that there were plenty of these people that used to do
00:28:28,00:28:34,this sit there for hours and get caught by a fisherman yeah wait but did they so did they
00:28:34,00:28:38,have their heads under water while they were waggling their glove above the water no because
00:28:38,00:28:45,it was so dark so they would they would sort of yes sit above and yeah but just in a nice little
00:28:45,00:28:50,spot it's brilliant this guy's an amazing guy that's real commitment to the job i don't know if
00:28:50,00:28:56,i'd sit in freezing cold water for a full day in a pond to catch a poacher i had a neighbour once
00:28:56,00:29:05,an elderly neighbour who would sleep in his car to try and catch car thieves really and he and he
00:29:05,00:29:12,called them right yeah waggling keys out of the window as soon as someone grabs them i was just
00:29:12,00:29:17,thinking them that this guy who's pretending to be a fish basically he's lucky that they're not
00:29:17,00:29:25,catching them with dynamite isn't he yeah because that does not work well actually
00:29:25,00:29:32,in the example in this interview they heard somebody go and get the net get the net and
00:29:32,00:29:41,then another voice goes get the net heck get the gun so one more thing about uh
00:29:41,00:29:46,olympians who have other jobs you know the brian brothers the the tennis the tennis guys the tennis
00:29:46,00:29:51,brands yeah we absolutely love the brian brothers uh so it's sort of best doubles partnership ever
00:29:51,00:29:56,of all time they've won a billion olympic medals and they have a second i don't know if i can call
00:29:56,00:30:00,it a job so i don't know how much profit they make from it but they also are a band they have the
00:30:00,00:30:07,brian brothers band and so bob plays the keyboard and mike is on uh the guitar or drums but he's
00:30:07,00:30:12,not on the drums when the drummer of the counting crows joins them which he does sometimes so like
00:30:12,00:30:18,the jit band and i mention it because everyone has to look up the 2009 song autograph which
00:30:18,00:30:25,i'd forgotten about but is it features cameos from andy murray and no fact jokovic and i'm
00:30:25,00:30:29,telling you i i wished to god it was this andy murray here because that would have been less
00:30:29,00:30:35,awkward than what they make andy murray the tennis player do it's it's about what a horrible
00:30:35,00:30:40,jurid is signing autographs after matches and andy murray's little rap section in the middle
00:30:40,00:30:47,includes the lyrics during wimbledon it gets really crazy my hand cramps up and my mind gets hazy
00:30:47,00:30:53,and um look i'm going to leave people to imagine the rest andy murray's rap section is never
00:30:53,00:31:00,the words that should never ever be put together another fun thing about ghost crabs is that they're
00:31:00,00:31:06,very house proud but only when they are sexually mature which maybe is the same for humans so when
00:31:06,00:31:11,males are not sexually mature and if you get female house crabs they burrow into the sand and
00:31:11,00:31:16,they leave these tiny little holes in the sand they're smaller than a tiny coin but they can go
00:31:16,00:31:21,four or five feet down which i think is kind of cool anyway they burrow holes into the sand and
00:31:21,00:31:25,they just throw the sand anywhere the sound that they've used to borrow they just chuck it all over
00:31:25,00:31:31,the beach but as soon as they hit sexual maturity they suddenly sculpt the sand into a perfect pyramid
00:31:31,00:31:36,and this is to sort of advertise themselves to ladies we think so a woman can look across a
00:31:36,00:31:41,beach and she'll spot the sexually mature men by the perfect pyramids that are next to their
00:31:41,00:31:46,entrances and you'll see you'll see the little entrance and then a little crabby footsteps
00:31:46,00:31:51,footprints going to the pyramid do you think that if a ghost crab goes to egypt they look over and
00:31:51,00:32:00,they go fucking hell there is a very attractive enormous ghost crab over there yeah very intimidating
00:32:00,00:32:08,trip very intimidating stag do for those males so you can find out a lot of things from city scans
00:32:08,00:32:16,of mummies they tried to they city scanned an egyptian priest called nas yamun and they scanned
00:32:16,00:32:22,his throat and his vocal cords and they could find out what his voice was like so they did the city
00:32:22,00:32:29,scan of his vocal cords they created a 3d printed vocal tract and then they kind of fired air down
00:32:29,00:32:34,it and they could work out exactly what he sounded like um and it's basically people on the internet
00:32:34,00:32:41,think he sounded a bit like britney spears cool oh i thought i thought i thought he just went
00:32:41,00:32:52,he goes like like that and you know how she goes yeah that's your cat you're thinking of
00:32:52,00:32:58,oh yeah sorry that's not pretty but yeah there was basically um they the sound did the rounds on
00:32:58,00:33:05,social media and a lot of britney spears fans were very excited about it wow i'm some released
00:33:05,00:33:10,material from 2000 years ago well the interesting thing is like nas yamun would have he was a priest
00:33:10,00:33:16,so he would have done a lot of singing and chanting in the temples so basically if you went back to
00:33:16,00:33:20,ancient egypt and you walked past the temple it would sound like someone's singing baby one more time
00:33:21,00:33:27,wow he wouldn't have been dressed as a schoolgirl though seems implausible might have been there's
00:33:27,00:33:34,probably a lot less chess players online than we actually think there are because they create fake
00:33:34,00:33:40,accounts and they build them up and up to be sort of well played chess players with high rankings
00:33:40,00:33:44,and then they play themselves and defeat that person so it's sort of creating bogus accounts in
00:33:44,00:33:54,order to defeat them and then raise your ranking imagine if it's just one guy have you heard of
00:33:54,00:34:00,sandbagging that's another cheating thing so yeah this is where you play deliberately badly to
00:34:00,00:34:05,qualify for a tournament that is actually a bit beneath you and then you win you take the brakes
00:34:05,00:34:11,off and you you thumb everybody that's that happens in golf as well people claim like you
00:34:11,00:34:16,you play badly for ages until your handicap gets way worse and then eventually you go right
00:34:16,00:34:20,today is the day that i'm going to try and win the tournament it's extremely locked down upon
00:34:20,00:34:25,yeah yeah well they've got measures in place don't they i think they have actual measures
00:34:25,00:34:30,in place now on the chess side to stop that so i think if you ever yeah i think it's if you ever
00:34:30,00:34:35,achieved certain high scores they look at it and go well there's no way that you can now suck that
00:34:35,00:34:40,much because you got to this level and if you if you won a certain amount of cash prize like a high
00:34:40,00:34:46,cash prize well how did you get to that you must be good you must be sandbagging us in order to
00:34:46,00:34:50,to do that so very embarrassing if you're not sandbagging and you are just having a really bad
00:34:50,00:34:59,exact night have you just got lucky one time yeah it happened i think they had to change the rules
00:34:59,00:35:04,or tighten them a few years ago because there was a middle school so sad when you're sort of forcing
00:35:04,00:35:10,12 year olds to do this but in texas it's called henderson middle school and they entered a competition
00:35:10,00:35:16,where you had to have a ranking under 900 and then they absolutely smashed it they were investigated
00:35:16,00:35:22,and it turned out they'd lost all of their previous 28 matches and they're really good and someone
00:35:22,00:35:26,worked out the chances of having lost them all being as good as they were and it was one in
00:35:26,00:35:33,sextillion that they could have lost all 28 which is like if they'd been then playing chess since
00:35:33,00:35:37,the start of the universe and everywhere in the universe it still wouldn't have happened probably
00:35:38,00:35:44,so they were disqualified but 12 year olds come on okay i think it's not impossible that some
00:35:44,00:35:47,people get to a really good position on chess.com because they're only playing people who are
00:35:47,00:35:53,deliberately losing in order to sandbag so they think they're incredible they win a big cash prize
00:35:53,00:35:56,and then the next time they play it their deficiencies are revealed and then they get banned
00:35:56,00:36:00,from playing because chess.com thinks they were the ones doing it it's absolutely mind field
00:36:00,00:36:07,it's a vicious cycle um other people who go down um sort of scavenging and and hunting around the
00:36:07,00:36:13,the lost rivers are the it's tiburn is that the pronunciation is it the tiburn angling society
00:36:13,00:36:18,yes the tiburn angling society it's just wonderful they they meet up once a year to report on the
00:36:18,00:36:24,fish they found it's always zero so it's not the greatest angling society but they are obsessed
00:36:24,00:36:31,with the idea of daylighting which is the idea of bringing these hidden rivers back to the surface
00:36:31,00:36:36,through destruction of the stuff on top of bringing the tiburn back to being what it once
00:36:36,00:36:41,gloriously was and it's an extraordinary thing that they put together in around 2000 where they
00:36:41,00:36:47,put a full report to show how they would do it where it would go it would demolish about one
00:36:47,00:36:51,billion pounds worth of real estate unfortunately telling it's only Buckingham Palace that needs
00:36:51,00:36:58,to go really it's Buckingham Palace that's part of their plan they want to get rid of it
00:36:58,00:37:04,i've one more thing about Houdini's habits at home when Houdini and his wife had an argument
00:37:04,00:37:10,he would leave he'd walk around the block and then he'd come back and he would open the door of
00:37:10,00:37:15,the room where his wife was and throw his hat into the room right if it was thrown out again
00:37:15,00:37:21,she was still angry and i guess he would do it again and if the hat remained in the room
00:37:21,00:37:26,she she calmed down and they were going and resolve it what if the argument was about him
00:37:26,00:37:31,leaving his clothes hanging around the house all the time like a lot of the arguments in my house
00:37:34,00:37:41,so i read a paper called Man and mongooses in indian culture by Derek Olodrick i'm not sure
00:37:41,00:37:47,that's how you pronounce his name but i'm looking up afterwards and i found the oldest known story
00:37:47,00:37:53,about mongooses and it's from 3 000 years ago there's a king who's having a feast and then a
00:37:53,00:37:58,mongoose walks in and half of his body is made out of gold and he comes in and he rolls in all
00:37:58,00:38:03,the food of the feast and the king's like what the hell are you doing and he said oh well i once
00:38:03,00:38:10,rolled in the food of a brahman uh like a really holy uh hindu guy uh and the brahman was so holy
00:38:10,00:38:15,that he turned when he rolled in his food he turned half into gold and this mongoose is going
00:38:15,00:38:21,around looking for another holy person so he can turn his whole body into gold right i don't know
00:38:21,00:38:26,if you want your whole body turned into gold i'm pretty sure king miters taught us that didn't he
00:38:26,00:38:31,yeah i really haven't come across each other king miters didn't turn into gold did he yeah
00:38:32,00:38:36,no no he turned everything he touched into gold he didn't like get a gold finger
00:38:36,00:38:40,and then no but what he but he regressed his leg and he had a gold leg i know he regressed it
00:38:40,00:38:43,because he couldn't eat but wait a minute what happened no no he regressed it because you couldn't
00:38:43,00:38:47,well partly because you if you touched another person who he loved they turned into gold and
00:38:47,00:38:51,that's based on the fact that people don't want to be turned into gold yeah what happened if
00:38:51,00:38:56,with king miters touched himself do we know in is it in the story or they didn't do that in those
00:38:56,00:39:04,days james it was a cleaner time i there was something about finland that was actually the
00:39:04,00:39:08,original article i read and it's about um and so an amazing fact that i didn't know and i can't
00:39:08,00:39:13,remember how the journalist lewis segwayed into it but i'm just going to segue into it by saying
00:39:13,00:39:20,she also mentioned that finland's only monarch the only monarch it's ever had is this german guy
00:39:20,00:39:26,who never visited finland that's all right and they this is in 1917 they got independence from
00:39:26,00:39:31,russia and they started off thinking we want a king everyone else has got or a queen um everyone
00:39:31,00:39:35,else has got one where should we find one we obviously don't have a royal family here in
00:39:35,00:39:40,finland because we're brand new and so they picked this guy uh frederick charles of hess
00:39:40,00:39:44,and he was a german prince they designed a crown for him which i think you can still
00:39:44,00:39:49,see it's on display somewhere in finland and then before he even had a chance to enter the country
00:39:50,00:39:53,they changed their mind uh after a few months and he abdicated
00:39:53,00:40:01,ah that's it that's did he abdicate from overseas as in he yeah he was out still outside god that's
00:40:01,00:40:06,been good in those days when there were all those new countries being formed and if you were if you
00:40:06,00:40:10,were a minor noble in anywhere in europe whenever there was a new country you must have been there
00:40:10,00:40:15,with your fingers crossed thinking oh maybe i'm going to be king at that you're sitting in the
00:40:15,00:40:19,waiting room with all the other potential monarchs going in for their interviews
00:40:19,00:40:26,i hope that bastard from schleswig holstein doesn't get it he's coming out looking all cocky
00:40:26,00:40:30,really ace the practical the waving section of the interview
00:40:30,00:40:39,here's one quick thing on forgeries um there is a forger or there was a forger called elmer
00:40:39,00:40:45,de horre he was a hungarian um in the united states and he did forgeries of loads of people
00:40:45,00:40:52,Picasso matisse and he did loads of forgeries of madigliani okay and he did so many madigliani
00:40:52,00:40:57,that these days it's impossible to compile a catalogue of madigliani's work because we don't
00:40:57,00:41:03,know what is real and what is a forgery by this guy de horre and the reason i bring it up is because
00:41:03,00:41:10,he has a collection of all of his forgeries and it's run by a guy called mark forgy no
00:41:10,00:41:15,who's got extremely fast internet as well hasn't
00:41:15,00:41:26,i like to have you guys come across freddy and truce overstegan no who were not today not
00:41:26,00:41:33,he's not at the hotel here um they were part of the dutch resistance in fact and they were
00:41:33,00:41:40,14 and 16 years old respectively and they were killers cold-blooded killers and they called
00:41:40,00:41:44,their kills liquidations which was kind of terrifying and apparently the 14 year old actually
00:41:44,00:41:48,looked about 12 so it was quite easy for them to get away with killing because no one expected
00:41:48,00:41:54,to be killed by a 12 year old girl and the way they did it was they had various methods but they
00:41:54,00:41:59,cycled around quite a lot i guess cycling was a thing for these resistance ladies and they would
00:41:59,00:42:04,ambush collaborators so they'd be on two bikes and they'd have pistols in their bike baskets
00:42:04,00:42:09,and they'd ambush them or sometimes they'd do a drive-by so freddy would be riding the bike and
00:42:09,00:42:14,truce would be on the back and you know cycle past them collaborators and just shoot them up as you
00:42:14,00:42:21,ride by off into the sunset and what was the liquidation bit or was that just a fancy they
00:42:21,00:42:26,would just shoot them as opposed there was no melting down no they didn't have like a vat of
00:42:26,00:42:32,acid in their cellar they dragged Nazi bodies cool get back what you didn't melt them down
00:42:32,00:42:38,no we just we just did a drive-by and shot them well you got to melt them down mate
00:42:38,00:42:42,maybe they did because i didn't look into it enough there are a few sort of modern
00:42:42,00:42:47,loopholes for companies in britain that don't have a liquor license and i was reading about one
00:42:47,00:42:53,place which was there was a new craft distillery in yorkshire that was being set up in a disused
00:42:53,00:42:58,train station so they'd done it up and it was for it was going to be for gin i believe and it's
00:42:58,00:43:03,called tapling and megan distilleries and by the time they were about to launch all the paperwork
00:43:03,00:43:08,hadn't been done yet for their license but they had this big party that they wanted to promote
00:43:08,00:43:14,their drinks so what they had to do was they looked and found a loophole which is if you're on a
00:43:14,00:43:19,moving train you don't need a liquor license so all trains that you buy alcohol on they don't
00:43:19,00:43:23,need a license a moving train is exempt from it and the fact that they were in a train station
00:43:23,00:43:28,and they had a parked train there they got all the guests onto the train and they took it on a
00:43:28,00:43:33,two and a half hour ride just to one they just went one way turned around well not even turned
00:43:33,00:43:39,around just drove back again and did a two and a half hour gin masterclass once it was in motion
00:43:39,00:43:44,and that that allowed them the loophole of of having the party still if you had a bar which had
00:43:44,00:43:51,a miniature train on the counter so it sort of came two chewing along with your drink does that
00:43:51,00:43:56,count and then you wouldn't need a liquor license maybe you have to be on the train so if you went
00:43:56,00:44:01,to like what's that um what's that sushi place which has got the conveyor belt if you got a young
00:44:01,00:44:07,sushi and you sit on the conveyor belt technically you don't need a license don't sit on one of the
00:44:07,00:44:12,coloured plates you will be selected um i was looking at other ways that museums need to preserve
00:44:12,00:44:19,their artefacts and one is from fires serious problem and it's a really difficult choice for
00:44:19,00:44:24,museums because the main way to get rid of fires is with sprinkler systems but obviously if you
00:44:24,00:44:30,sprinkle a whole art gallery then you sort of ruin the paintings that way but so a lot of museums
00:44:30,00:44:35,kind of don't do it and that was a serious problem in brazil you might remember a couple of years
00:44:35,00:44:41,ago when the main museum in brazil destroyed 90 percent of its collection because of a fire and
00:44:41,00:44:46,they just didn't have the adequate protection but there is one place the Getty Museum in LA
00:44:46,00:44:53,which has such cool fireproof systems so they have like they had the big wildfires last year
00:44:53,00:44:58,and they were pretty much licking at the sides of the museum and the curators were completely
00:44:58,00:45:03,chilled out about it because it's so well protected so it's full of like Rembrandt's and Manet's but
00:45:03,00:45:08,they first of all they have a system where the oxygen can get sucked out of the rooms
00:45:08,00:45:12,so that as soon as a fire got in there it wouldn't be able to breathe and so it would just immediately
00:45:12,00:45:18,go out so it's like an anti-ventilation system and then they also have around the museum a million
00:45:18,00:45:24,gallon water tank and so as soon as a fire starts coming close they just start releasing water into
00:45:24,00:45:29,the ground all around the museum like a moat it's great and so firefighters who are fighting the
00:45:29,00:45:33,wildfires use the museum as like a rest area and a vantage point to look around at the rest of LA
00:45:33,00:45:42,and go ah well I guess I guess the art's okay wow really clever that's really clever uh well just
00:45:42,00:45:48,speaking of water um there was a museum in Spain which is the Museum of Underwater Archaeology
00:45:48,00:45:51,which is called Aqua uh and they've had a real problem with leaks this year
00:45:51,00:46:00,now hang on honestly they get all of their stuff is stuff that's been found underwater like statues
00:46:00,00:46:06,which are sunk or with um shipwrecks or anything that's come from the bottom of the ocean and they
00:46:06,00:46:12,have hundreds of thousands of things in there but they also have leaks in the basement and a lot of
00:46:12,00:46:16,damp causing problems with the wall and they're really worried about it and they reckon that it's
00:46:16,00:46:19,going to wreck all of the things which have been under water for thousands hundreds of years
00:46:19,00:46:27,oh no um have you guys heard of at nuclear trains a twitter account no no this is a really cool one
00:46:27,00:46:32,so it's a twitter bot um and it's made by two scientists who are called Matt Allinson and
00:46:32,00:46:38,Keir Little and what it does is it tracks trains which are carrying nuclear waste across the UK
00:46:38,00:46:44,so these trains go I didn't know they existed actually is that sorry I didn't know there were
00:46:44,00:46:49,trains that had uh nuclear well right you it's not they're yet to tweet
00:46:49,00:46:57,no no um well yeah I mean it's not it's not common knowledge but they sort of they have you have to
00:46:57,00:47:02,transport radioactive containers and trains are not a bad way of doing it they're very tightly
00:47:02,00:47:08,sealed um and these guys they're not pro or anti nuclear they they genuinely are just in it for
00:47:08,00:47:15,the trains as they say um and they have clarified that the radiation you would get because sometimes
00:47:15,00:47:20,these pass along platforms you know they go through brickson or whatever quite near passengers
00:47:20,00:47:23,but they've said that the radiation you would get if you were on the platform one of these
00:47:23,00:47:28,trains went by will be like you just eat one banana isn't that amazing that everyone on the
00:47:28,00:47:32,platform has just eaten the equivalent of one banana but would you feel it would you feel full
00:47:32,00:47:42,everyone slips over on the platform yeah no they don't emit bananas um they just get that much
00:47:42,00:47:48,radiation yeah exactly yeah yeah yeah but that's quite dangerous because if you are such a banana
00:47:48,00:47:52,lover that you're constantly operating on the banana eating cusp of getting radiation poisoning
00:47:53,00:47:58,and you manage it right you know you're eating 350 bananas a day and you know 351 would tip you
00:47:58,00:48:03,over the edge yeah yeah you're right yeah what happens then Andy if a train full of bananas
00:48:03,00:48:08,passes by what is the radiation level in that at that speed that that kills you immediately
00:48:08,00:48:14,so you have to transport bananas one by one don't they that's why they're so expensive once they
00:48:14,00:48:21,get to the shops do you know that this is one of my favorite totally random facts but you know
00:48:21,00:48:27,Penny Mordant who was very briefly actually Defense Secretary last year yeah and before that was
00:48:27,00:48:34,International Development Secretary you know she's named after a Royal Navy frigate wow she's named
00:48:34,00:48:40,after HMS Penelope that's so funny isn't that weird that's a really good giant frigate it's
00:48:40,00:48:45,because she's from an army family and actually it was known as HMS Pepperpot because it was
00:48:45,00:48:51,shelled so many so many times in World War two so she could easily be Pepperpot Mordant
00:48:51,00:48:59,don't she do that dive which is is that Iron Man's wife Pepperpots is Iron Man's girlfriend yeah
00:48:59,00:49:04,oh really yeah maybe that's why they didn't go with Pepperpot they didn't want her to be confused
00:49:04,00:49:09,why is she called Pepperpots it's a weird name it's because she comes from a comic book like all
00:49:09,00:49:15,these characters that they often they often have quite funny names and illiterate names don't they
00:49:15,00:49:23,yeah good point I read about one plane crash or you know emergency landing in 2013 this guy called
00:49:23,00:49:27,John Pedersen and he realized that his plane had had a little bit of damage and he wasn't going to
00:49:27,00:49:34,make it all the way to the nearest airports this was in around Chicago and so he saw a long road
00:49:34,00:49:39,and he thought well you know that's probably the best way to go I'm going to try and stop on this
00:49:39,00:49:43,road but obviously there's traffic on this road so he doesn't want to hit any and what he managed to
00:49:43,00:49:49,do was exactly time it so that when the lights went red and everyone stops that's when he landed
00:49:49,00:49:54,in the middle of this intersection is that amazing wow that's his story and he's sticking to it
00:49:54,00:50:01,I was reading this article about it in the Chicago newspaper and they said that he landed and didn't
00:50:01,00:50:05,hit anyone and he was in the middle of this intersection and then the lights changed and
00:50:05,00:50:13,two cars just went and didn't notice him and crashed into him what and then just apparently
00:50:13,00:50:20,it says and then mysteriously sped off so they kind of drove hit this plane and then thought oh
00:50:20,00:50:24,shit I've just hit a plane and they just did a hit and run on this left the seat of the accident
00:50:24,00:50:29,so I can't be bothered to fill the form in on this one no one's going to believe that are they
00:50:29,00:50:34,I'm never going to get this sort of claim this plane just pulled out in front of me
00:50:34,00:50:44,people always think that pneumatic technology is going to be the next big thing I think there was
00:50:44,00:50:51,a lot of excitement in the US about 40 years ago that it was going to be how we all disposed of our
00:50:51,00:50:57,rubbish and so Disneyland I think was a pioneer of this right so their entire garbage disposal
00:50:57,00:51:02,system is fully pneumatic so if you're in Disneyland you put something in a bin and then it drops down
00:51:02,00:51:07,into a tunnel system and every 20 minutes it just gets sucked about 60 miles an hour to a collection
00:51:07,00:51:11,point there are a lot of theme park nerds who are about to get angry at you because it's the magic
00:51:11,00:51:16,kingdom of Walt Disney world in Florida not Disneyland I guarantee you're gonna thank you for
00:51:16,00:51:22,that correction I got to do a behind the scenes tour there once so I actually got to see some of the
00:51:22,00:51:27,tunnels that those go through and you're just kind of walking through the backstage tunnels and there's
00:51:27,00:51:31,just this tube next to you where every 20 minutes or so you just hear this hang on so do you do you
00:51:31,00:51:37,have to sort of dive out the way every 20 minutes no it's just it's just a tube on a wall it's not
00:51:37,00:51:42,like a transparent how big is the tube can you fit a human in it it's 20 inches diameter I think
00:51:42,00:51:51,can you fit a mouse in it 20 inches okay so that's pretty big yeah I reckon yeah I I've been to
00:51:51,00:51:55,Disneyland and Disney world as well and the rides I don't really like them as much I prefer the
00:51:55,00:52:01,Universal ones the rides but if there was a garbage chute I think then I would be definitely
00:52:01,00:52:04,going for you could sell t-shirts saying why don't you get sucked off at Disneyland
00:52:04,00:52:12,like the rubbish for our pneumatic tube system I will I will argue with you for like half an hour
00:52:12,00:52:16,that Universal's rides are terrible compared to Disney's but we do not have the time for that
00:52:22,00:52:29,have you heard of Jebediah Buxton uh no I don't think so my favorite plaque plucky
00:52:29,00:52:38,in the UK lived in Derbyshire the label is mental calculator so Jebediah Buxton lived in the early
00:52:38,00:52:45,18th century I we think he was an autistic savant you know people who could do unbelievable
00:52:45,00:52:50,calculations in their head so Jebediah Buxton was once asked after a church sermon what did
00:52:50,00:52:56,you think of the sermon and he said oh I just counted how many words there were in it he just
00:52:56,00:53:02,gave a word count that's so good I know he was self he was completely self-taught not formally
00:53:02,00:53:06,trained at all and didn't know much about anything except numbers but knew everything about numbers
00:53:06,00:53:09,so he walked around the local area which is called Elmton which is about a thousand acres
00:53:09,00:53:16,and he could give its size not only in acres but also in square inches wow he was amazing
00:53:16,00:53:19,sorry I have no idea what you just said because I was trying to count the number of words you were
00:53:19,00:53:23,saying
00:53:23,00:53:30,not as easy as it sounds is it it really isn't really is not uh if you get a seal and you blindfold
00:53:30,00:53:36,it and you give it a pair of earmuffs then it can't find fish um I'm not surprised yeah yeah
00:53:36,00:53:42,I'm not surprised at all actually sorry I've misread this they can find fish oh if you blindfold
00:53:42,00:53:46,them and give them earmuffs okay that's gone from being an incredibly underwhelming fact
00:53:46,00:53:52,it's being quite interesting and it's because they use their whiskers right and the whiskers
00:53:52,00:53:58,can tell the movements in the water and this is amazing so when fish swim we talked before that
00:53:58,00:54:03,they have like lots of eddies and vortices and stuff like that which they leave in the water
00:54:03,00:54:10,these seals whiskers can detect these tiny little vortices in a fish that swam past 30 seconds ago
00:54:10,00:54:15,so it swam past 30 seconds ago and it can still feel where it was and then it can still follow the
00:54:16,00:54:22,track of the fish to get that even if it's wearing earmuffs oh wow that is amazing can it tell sort
00:54:22,00:54:28,of the time that's passed rather than up to 30 like can they be like oh 15 seconds ahead because
00:54:28,00:54:34,they can tell the strength of the wait they can't tell the future not the future what I'm saying
00:54:34,00:54:40,is they could count up to 30 but when they feel it let's say it's a wake that comes past 15 seconds
00:54:40,00:54:45,after it's been there can they know it's 15 seconds I don't know if they can count up to 30
00:54:45,00:54:52,I don't know if they know it's exactly 30 but I think they will have a basic idea of time
00:54:52,00:54:57,and we'll know that and know that the vortices will be stronger if it has gone more recently
00:54:57,00:55:00,passed I mean it's like smelling something you know you feel like getting stronger as you get
00:55:00,00:55:04,closer don't you yeah you don't when you're trying to find something in your house where the smells
00:55:04,00:55:10,coming from you're not counting this you know your nose isn't saying that's exactly five meters away
00:55:10,00:55:17,but you can tell that it's closer or further guys don't do that I think if you want to sue anyone
00:55:17,00:55:25,you should sue the makers of Sherlock Holmes baffled have you guys seen that movie no it's from 1900
00:55:25,00:55:32,it's the first ever movie with Sherlock Holmes in it and it's an American silent film and basically
00:55:32,00:55:39,it's very much against the canon of Sherlock Holmes because what happens is people keep kind of
00:55:39,00:55:45,stealing things from under his nose and then using trick photography they just disappear
00:55:45,00:55:50,and then you just get a picture of Sherlock Holmes going oh what happened there why did they disappear
00:55:50,00:55:54,and then they reappear in another part of the room and then they steal something else
00:55:54,00:55:59,and then disappear again and it goes on like that for a couple of minutes and I just don't think
00:55:59,00:56:05,that that's really I mean first of all he doesn't solve anything he just stands there looking confused
00:56:05,00:56:10,yeah he's baffled yeah well that was made in 1900 I believe right is that right James so there's
00:56:10,00:56:18,another one which I'd love to see 1916 the mystery of the leaping fish and this was a movie where
00:56:18,00:56:25,Sherlock Holmes was sort of lampooed by Douglas Fairbanks Douglas Fairbanks junior who was one
00:56:25,00:56:30,of Hollywood's leading actors at the time he was a swashbuckling adventurer and he along with Charlie
00:56:30,00:56:35,Chaplin they set up they set up UA United Artists and he was a huge influence in Hollywood back in
00:56:35,00:56:40,the day and he played basically the druggy version of Sherlock Holmes really bringing up that side
00:56:40,00:56:46,of his character so the way that in the movie he was presented he wasn't called Sherlock Holmes
00:56:46,00:56:55,he was called Coke Anyday E-N-N-Y-D-A-Y as his surname and he had a bandolier of syringes that he
00:56:55,00:57:02,wore across his chest so he was constantly injecting himself as the movie went along with cocaine yeah
00:57:02,00:57:09,he had a clock with the clock face it says eats drinks sleeps and dope instead of the numbers
00:57:09,00:57:15,so he would know when to inject himself and the idea was that Coke Anyday was trying to find all
00:57:15,00:57:20,of these drug barons and once he caught them he would sample all the drugs that they had
00:57:20,00:57:26,as he was busting them and Fairbanks hated the movie after it came out it was only a two-realer
00:57:26,00:57:31,and he just said this is horrific but that's one of the earliest Sherlock Holmes movies as well
00:57:31,00:57:40,amazing do you say 1916? 1916 yeah houses but that Dan that was the first year as the first full length
00:57:40,00:57:46,Sherlock Holmes film but this was a bit more serious because he was because it wasn't a mad
00:57:46,00:57:52,cocaine rob it was um he was played by William Gillette who was a distant cousin of the Gillette
00:57:52,00:57:59,razor family yeah Gillette exactly yeah um and uh William Gillette was a really interesting guy so
00:57:59,00:58:05,he only played Sherlock Holmes in one movie but um that was after he played him on stage about
00:58:05,00:58:10,"1,300 times he'd come up with a stage version of it and yeah and he and Arthur Conan Doyle were"
00:58:10,00:58:16,actually friends they I mean Arthur Conan Doyle was probably pleased because he managed to work
00:58:16,00:58:20,out a way of doing the character well on stage and it was you know respectful and all of this
00:58:20,00:58:26,but also entertaining and when they met I really like this William Gillette um they were meeting
00:58:26,00:58:33,I think on the same train and Gillette got off the train dressed as Holmes and then he found Arthur
00:58:33,00:58:38,Conan Doyle and he examined him through a magnifying glass and that was from that point onwards they
00:58:38,00:58:45,were firm friends Conan Doyle loved it yeah that's it's a risky move isn't it because he really is
00:58:45,00:58:53,yeah yeah he might think you were taking the piss a little bit but we also we had um temperance bars
00:58:53,00:59:00,in Britain which were super popular around the end of the 19th century again with this big push to
00:59:00,00:59:04,stop people drinking and apparently for every little mill town there would be at least three
00:59:04,00:59:10,temperance bars which is essentially like a I mean the cafe like a milk bar like it's a cafe
00:59:10,00:59:15,yeah I think they might they used to be not not that long ago there was definitely one in Lancashire
00:59:15,00:59:20,I know that much well there's one left now and uh it's Fitzpatrick's in Lancashire you're absolutely
00:59:20,00:59:27,right and the owner of Fitzpatrick's in 2012 he'd just been on Harry Biker's actually and talking
00:59:27,00:59:31,about the great stuff about non-alcoholic drinks like dandelion burdock and how great abstinence is
00:59:31,00:59:39,and how popular the bar still was and then he was done for drink driving have you guys heard of the
00:59:39,00:59:48,nuclear bomb that was dropped on the gregs but I can understand that okay gregs well no I've tricked
00:59:48,00:59:53,you with my words this is the story of the only nuclear bomb that has ever been dropped on American
00:59:53,01:00:00,soil by an American plane okay and it fell on the family who were called the gregs um they lived in
01:00:00,01:00:06,South Carolina parents three kids uh their cousin everyone was playing the kids were playing in the
01:00:06,01:00:12,in the yard next door to the garden right perfectly normal afternoon high above them in the sky there's
01:00:12,01:00:18,a plane which is doing a training exercise with a real nuclear bomb where they have to transport
01:00:18,01:00:23,it across the country um so training exercise there had been some kind of mess up with getting it
01:00:23,01:00:30,sort of locked into its um its sort of um hangar thing you know it's hanging there above the
01:00:30,01:00:36,bomb bay doors um so the captain sends a crew member to adjust the the locking mechanism the
01:00:36,01:00:42,crew member uh can't quite get a handle these are huge bombs it looks like a you know it looks like
01:00:42,01:00:47,a whale weighs about three tons the crew member climbs slightly up the side of the bomb and reaches
01:00:47,01:00:52,up to grab something to get a handhold unfortunately what he grabs is the emergency bomb release
01:00:52,01:01:00,mechanism right oh and then does he fly down on it like in dr strange level so the exact well the
01:01:00,01:01:05,bomb falls onto the bomb bay doors right which crumple like paper yeah the crew member makes
01:01:05,01:01:12,an x shape with his body and just about stays inside the plane okay the bomb is now falling
01:01:12,01:01:19,towards the completely unaware greg family house it lands in their garden it makes a crater 15 meters
01:01:19,01:01:26,across and 10 meters deep the no one is killed the family are all injured but they they you know
01:01:26,01:01:31,they became superheroes no they become superheroes um the family's chickens unfortunately were
01:01:31,01:01:35,vaporized but the but thank god the bomb did not go fully nuclear it kind of had the
01:01:35,01:01:42,safety catch on but then amazingly they stayed the the crew was so apologetic they were so
01:01:42,01:01:46,mortified they'd done this and they wrote to the family apologizing and they stayed in touch for
01:01:46,01:01:52,years with the crew this family the great even to the extent that one of them visited the family
01:01:52,01:01:59,for a week's holiday many years later wow that's so nice that's incredible that must have been an
01:01:59,01:02:02,embarrassing moment because i used to get embarrassed enough you know when you had to knock on your
01:02:02,01:02:08,neighbor's door and say i'm really sorry i've kicked my football into your garden i am so sorry i have
01:02:08,01:02:14,dropped my nuclear bomb in your backyard um in the vietnam war i don't think we've ever mentioned
01:02:14,01:02:21,operation wandering soul have we which was one of the tactics that the us used against vietnamese
01:02:21,01:02:28,soldiers which was to play ghost noises incredibly loudly out of helicopters and from u.s soldiers
01:02:28,01:02:33,sort of hidden in vietnam they'd have these big boomboxes and play ghost noises that doesn't seem
01:02:33,01:02:39,like it would work because helicopters are extremely loud and it's not like you're gonna
01:02:39,01:02:44,they're not like they can sneak up on you and then play this noise you're going to be first thing
01:02:44,01:02:49,is you hear the helicopter and you're going to go why a ghost driving helicopters now doesn't make
01:02:49,01:02:54,any sense you're so right the idea was that in vietnam the belief is that if you don't get a
01:02:54,01:03:00,proper burial then your soul wanders the earth and so they actually recorded south vietnamese
01:03:00,01:03:04,people they recruited south vietnamese people to record themselves shrieking and screaming and
01:03:04,01:03:09,saying my friends i've come back to let you know that i am dead i'm dead don't end up like me go
01:03:09,01:03:15,home quickly wow really crazy and the vietnamese soldiers mainly didn't believe them and all it
01:03:15,01:03:22,did was give them a target to return fire to so oh no that would still scare me i have to say if
01:03:22,01:03:28,if the four of us were out you know in a in a jungle and we were scared in a boombox had a voice of
01:03:28,01:03:35,saying alex bell saying don't come over here i'm dead i get scared by that what situation why are we
01:03:35,01:03:42,in the jungle then i mean what how badly wrong is our tour gone that way we're on foot in vietnamese
01:03:42,01:03:48,jungle and why still alex bell yeah and why does it take a boombox and a helicopter and the jungle
01:03:48,01:03:57,for you to pay any attention to alex bell alex if you're listening here's how you get us to
01:03:57,01:04:02,actually upload the podcast correctly when you say there there are all these museums around
01:04:02,01:04:07,nice and some of them do sound i would say of limited interest so there's a museum there's an
01:04:07,01:04:15,island called hi me hi me um and there's collector on there who's collection museum whatever you like
01:04:15,01:04:22,it's a lifetime of paper napkins which are organized by theme into binders and for online
01:04:22,01:04:28,her sofa is covered in binders full of paper napkins i just does anybody else feel an overwhelming
01:04:28,01:04:36,sense of sadness well there's napkins there to wipe your tears away so yeah that's so true
01:04:36,01:04:41,place to have a cry um they have a museum of sea monsters but the way that they've done that is
01:04:41,01:04:47,they have the stories of sea monsters um like any museum might do but the founders they phoned
01:04:47,01:04:54,every single care home in iceland and they asked for all of the elderly residents do you know any
01:04:54,01:04:59,stories about sea monsters that have happened in your history or have you heard any stories
01:04:59,01:05:02,and they collected all of those and they're all the stories that are in the museum which i think
01:05:02,01:05:09,is a really good way of finding social history isn't it yeah so wonderful but that's the origin of
01:05:09,01:05:14,of grim's fairy tales in the first place isn't it the grim brothers didn't write them they went
01:05:14,01:05:19,around and collected them they really mostly from women yeah there's a woman i think she was called
01:05:19,01:05:26,daughter wilder who gave lots of the stories but they went around and particularly older women
01:05:26,01:05:31,asked them for the stories that they remember i mean really we ought to be doing more of that
01:05:31,01:05:37,i think that that kind of gathering of stories is a wonderful thing so good for them that's great
01:05:37,01:05:42,yeah it sounds wonderful it sounds like an incredible filing system but done as an entire
01:05:42,01:05:49,country where they're all dedicated to filing one aspect to social history yeah it's just yeah
01:05:49,01:05:53,it's incredible with the grim brothers i read a story which i really hope is true i always keep
01:05:53,01:05:57,meaning to look it up which is when they were gathering the stories one of the brothers was
01:05:57,01:06:05,trying to get a great story of a sailor or some guy who who knew a bunch and he said what can i
01:06:05,01:06:10,give you to give me your story and the sailor needed new trousers so the grim brother gave
01:06:10,01:06:15,his trousers on the spot to this guy to wear and then gave him his story and he took it down sort of
01:06:15,01:06:20,you know trouserless as he was as he was taking it just love i love that kind of i need your story
01:06:20,01:06:25,what do you need my trousers fine go for it did that wait did the guy did the guy who was talking
01:06:25,01:06:30,to not have any trousers on no he was probably just was he approaching a trouserless man and say
01:06:30,01:06:36,tell me your story i think a trouserless sailor there's another story there yeah wait was it the
01:06:36,01:06:44,story of when he the poo i'm actually in Berlin there was a traffic jam this year that was in the
01:06:44,01:06:51,news which was this is in february and this was created by one german artist who calls himself
01:06:51,01:06:57,an artist called simon weckert who created a traffic jam by just pulling a handcart so he was
01:06:57,01:07:02,on foot and pulling a handcart behind him carrying 99 phones so how google maps works is when it's
01:07:02,01:07:08,giving you traffic updates it assesses all the number of phones in a certain area and then assumes
01:07:08,01:07:12,that those are lots of people in cars and then assumes that that means there's a huge traffic jam
01:07:12,01:07:18,so google assumed massive traffic jam on this one bridge and it redirected traffic around it
01:07:18,01:07:22,and this guy was just him on his own walking through the centre of berlin he actually walked
01:07:22,01:07:27,past google's offices just to do a sort of middle finger up to them i guess that must be so freaky
01:07:27,01:07:30,for the guys at google they must say oh my god the traffic jam it's coming this way
01:07:30,01:07:39,it's an invisible one they're the worst that's hilarious they they claim to be supportive google
01:07:39,01:07:45,a google spokesperson said whether via car or cart or camel we love seeing creative uses of google
01:07:45,01:07:51,maps as it helps us make our work better oh yeah doesn't sound like they really liked it and now
01:07:51,01:07:57,that guy has been killed he's been disappeared won't find him on google maps anymore um one thing
01:07:57,01:08:04,that's quite similar which is uh about modern technology and slightly hacking it is the old
01:08:04,01:08:10,teslas um which would drive you could set them to drive just underneath the speed limit wherever
01:08:10,01:08:17,you were um they would read the traffic signs and so researchers at mackafee realised that if you
01:08:17,01:08:23,got a 35 mile per hour traffic sign and you got some black sticky tape and turned the three into an
01:08:23,01:08:33,eight then your tesla would drive at 85 miles an hour in nine wow these are the old teslas and
01:08:33,01:08:38,new ones don't do that anymore um i think possibly thanks to this little bit of um work by mackafee
01:08:38,01:08:43,but it just i mean especially as a 35 mile an hour traffic signs are usually in places that
01:08:43,01:08:49,need people to slow down it's yeah yeah and that's that's why we're still in the trialing stage really
01:08:49,01:08:56,of the driverless cars isn't it like one smear on a speed sign and everyone dies have we ever talked
01:08:56,01:09:02,about just that reminds me of the tree of tenoray which is in um always in i think Liberia but
01:09:02,01:09:08,somewhere up there and um it was the most isolated tree in the world and there was no tree anywhere
01:09:08,01:09:13,for like i don't know 100 miles in any direction and then it got knocked over by a libyan truck
01:09:13,01:09:19,driver literally there's nothing else to and he just decided i'm just going to drive straight into
01:09:19,01:09:24,that by accident that must have been like the scene in austin powers where the guy's being
01:09:24,01:09:28,about to be run over by the steamroller and he's shouting no from about 20 meters away very very
01:09:28,01:09:34,slowly do you think the guy the truck driver was similarly i don't see anything else i think that's
01:09:34,01:09:39,a really unfair analogy because in austin powers the idiot is the person who's about to be run over
01:09:39,01:09:45,so that implies you're blaming the tree and the tree's gone to extreme lengths to escape traffic
01:09:45,01:09:51,collisions it's so socially distanced that tree it is i think what it is is there's something about
01:09:51,01:09:56,people when they're driving if there's a massive area with nothing there at all but there's one
01:09:56,01:10:02,thing then some reason you just kind of get drawn towards it like your brain just can't
01:10:02,01:10:08,avoid it there there is a thing called target fixation isn't there where someone is so focused
01:10:08,01:10:12,on avoiding a thing that they keep looking at the thing and aiming towards it accidentally the
01:10:12,01:10:15,conversation equivalent is that thing which is in the meaning of lift where there's something
01:10:15,01:10:19,you're trying to avoid talking about and so you can never avoid talking about it and i think the
01:10:19,01:10:23,example that's given in that book is if you're talking to someone with one leg and you find
01:10:23,01:10:28,your conversation is liberally peppered with references to long john silver or the last leg
01:10:28,01:10:35,of the ua for competition it reminds me of um michael windsor who is now basal brushes pa
01:10:35,01:10:40,jenny you're always you're always name dropping i am friends with basal brush aren't you that's why
01:10:40,01:10:48,i'm friends with basal brush so the way he got the job was he rang up basal brushes creator's son
01:10:48,01:10:54,as basal brush and auditioned for him during that you just just was in character the whole time
01:10:54,01:10:58,did the voice perfectly got his mannerisms and he got the job
01:10:58,01:11:03,phone call which is an absolutely bold move because yeah you've got the potential to really
01:11:03,01:11:09,upset somebody who literally this guy sees basal brush as his brother that's how um that's how
01:11:09,01:11:14,peter cellars as well got his first job peter cellars of inspector clue so fame and the goonshow
01:11:14,01:11:19,and so on he was getting nowhere and he was an impressionist and he called up the bbc and he
01:11:19,01:11:25,did an impression of the the head of the bbc at the time saying to the person who's the producer
01:11:25,01:11:32,picking up going have you got this peter cellars not in american it's where's peter cellars where's
01:11:32,01:11:37,this peter cellars guy hey this kid's hard i hear you've got to get him you've got to get him now
01:11:37,01:11:42,so yeah say he imitated it and the guy went oh i'm so sorry well yeah we'll book him and peter
01:11:42,01:11:47,cellars later admitted that was actually me but the guy was so impressed that's hilarious that's
01:11:47,01:11:51,actually how rory bremnes still keeps getting jobs he can do a very good impression of the director
01:11:51,01:11:58,general of the bbc that's not fair rory bremnes great i don't know why i said that do you know
01:11:58,01:12:05,vanilla ice is real name oh i feel like i should um oh gosh i can't remember it's a piece called
01:12:05,01:12:14,rob rob van winkel oh yeah anyway apparently why on earth would you change that i mean that's
01:12:14,01:12:20,a fantastic name and also wait a minute it scans perfectly doesn't it rip van winkel
01:12:20,01:12:28,he wouldn't have to do ice ice baby he's got you're absolutely right yeah he was called vanilla
01:12:28,01:12:31,because he was the only one in his friendship group who was white and he got called that and
01:12:31,01:12:37,then he had a dance move called the ice right i didn't i didn't know it was white i didn't know
01:12:37,01:12:44,anything about it you're kidding he almost played london i think in 2019 or 2020 possibly yeah 2018
01:12:44,01:12:50,or 2019 on ice it's going to be his first vanilla ice on ice no funster yeah and he sings a song
01:12:50,01:12:56,where the lyrics are ice ice baby this guy has an obsession he's got a problem it's an issue
01:12:57,01:13:03,actually um like crowley has something in common with rex lambett uh founding editor of bbc's list
01:13:03,01:13:09,the magazine is it that they were both insane i suppose so actually you'll get sued for that and
01:13:09,01:13:15,this is about being sued as well so um allister crowley tried to sue a writer called nina hamnet
01:13:15,01:13:20,for libel because she called him a black magician um she said he was into black magic and he said
01:13:20,01:13:26,that this wasn't true and he tried to sue her and he lost and he was declared bankrupt and then
01:13:26,01:13:30,towards the end basically he became a big drug addict because he'd taken a lot of drugs before
01:13:30,01:13:36,and then he became a real drug addict and he died quite young um but i was reading about nina hamnet
01:13:36,01:13:42,and according to wikipedia she was a welsh artist and writer who was an expert on sailor shanties
01:13:42,01:13:50,and became known as the queen of bohemia she sounds incredible isn't she um she was basically um like
01:13:50,01:13:57,one of the main people in soho around the 1930s who kind of knew absolutely everyone um she had
01:13:57,01:14:02,an incredible bohemian life but actually when she sued crowley it became such big news that it really
01:14:02,01:14:09,kind of wrecked her life and she became a bit of a alcoholic just walking around taverns in fitrovia
01:14:09,01:14:18,trading anecdotes for drinks sad if you take on black magic you're always wins yeah um i was amazed
01:14:18,01:14:23,about other people's connections to the occult around this time and people who i thought were
01:14:23,01:14:29,just legit humans so the way crowley first got into this whole world was i think he joined
01:14:29,01:14:34,an order which is called the hermetic order of the golden dawn and another leading figure in that
01:14:34,01:14:41,was yate which as in wb yate and he was actually him and his partner more gone famously his sort of
01:14:41,01:14:47,muse and also iin nesbit who wrote the samyard if anyone's read that um anyway like five children
01:14:47,01:14:52,in it yeah exactly wow sort of makes sense when you think about it you can imagine someone who
01:14:52,01:14:59,was into weirdo magic writing that yeah but yates was a chapter leader for this order and crowley
01:14:59,01:15:04,didn't like him and there was this big rivalry going on about who should be ruling this chapel
01:15:04,01:15:09,crowley or yates and eventually crowley invaded his chapel mid sermon he launched what he called
01:15:09,01:15:16,an astral siege on the chapel which involved um kicking the doors down and he was wearing a kilt
01:15:16,01:15:22,for some reason and a cyrus mask because it's by by egyptian mythology and he started casting
01:15:22,01:15:27,spells and waving daggers around and the police had to come and break it up wow well yeah the big
01:15:27,01:15:31,story of that it's called the battle of blithe road and the story is that he came through and he
01:15:31,01:15:37,started propelling black magic at yates and the others as he was coming up the stairs yates was
01:15:37,01:15:42,using white magic and the white magic toppled him over down the stairs now that's what they say
01:15:42,01:15:47,but when you read into it what it actually was is he was coming up the stairs and yates
01:15:47,01:15:52,and his buddy who was a boxer was kicking him back down the stairs is that what white magic is
01:15:52,01:15:58,white magic is some big guy kicking you down the stairs yeah exactly he's one of the gladiators
01:15:58,01:16:05,this is white magic but this this order the idea was they wanted to discover a unified theory that
01:16:05,01:16:11,explained the magical world so that they could bring endless possibilities to magicians that
01:16:11,01:16:16,was why they were set up and that's why yates joined he wanted to use it for good um and so
01:16:16,01:16:24,he joined crowley and he had a mentor there and the name of his mentor alan bennett wow yeah how
01:16:24,01:16:28,good i mean it's not actual alan bennett obviously i was summoning a demon yesterday
01:16:28,01:16:36,um this year has had an exciting new naval battle which is great because you know not as many
01:16:36,01:16:40,classic naval counters as there yeah definitely well i don't want to get old Jeremy carbon on your
01:16:40,01:16:46,aster i promise this is a good one because this is the first naval battle in the caribbean for
01:16:46,01:16:53,75 years um and it's between uh venezuela uh venezuelan naval patrol vessel which was doing the
01:16:53,01:16:58,rounds um defending the motherland and so on and it had guns anti aircraft guns that machine guns
01:16:58,01:17:04,mounted on the deck lots of stuff on the other side was a portuguese cruise ship uh which included
01:17:04,01:17:10,an 80 seat theater a sauna and a jacuzzi okay the venezuelan patrol vessels as it said you're being
01:17:10,01:17:15,very territorially aggressive or something they basically they were chanting her arm a bit
01:17:15,01:17:19,they approached they ordered it to come into port uh in venezuela and you know surrender and all of
01:17:19,01:17:24,this they then opened fire and then they rammed the ship okay they rammed the cruise ship but
01:17:24,01:17:28,unfortunately they didn't realize that the cruise ship question the resolute was built for polar
01:17:28,01:17:35,cruising and i had a one meter thick hull the venezuelan naval patrol vessel crumpled basically
01:17:35,01:17:45,like a tin can 44 sailors had to be rescued unbelievably embarrassing wow yeah that must
01:17:45,01:17:50,have really that must have really livened up that cruise ship cruise for the on board and and if you
01:17:50,01:17:55,look out on your left you'll see the venezuelan navy and venezuela is now owned by thomas cuck is
01:17:55,01:18:05,that right that's right yeah amazing you know that there's a lot of art that just sits out at sea
01:18:05,01:18:13,on private yachts that often are worth sort of two to three times the value of the yacht itself
01:18:13,01:18:20,they're such valuable pieces of art so for example um joe louis has a 200 million pound super yacht he
01:18:20,01:18:25,is the majority stakeholder of totland hot spurs the football club he is he's a very he's a billionaire
01:18:25,01:18:30,in the uk and um he has a yacht and that moored and when it moored people could see through the
01:18:30,01:18:36,window and they saw hanging inside one of the rooms a francis bacon painting that sold anonymously
01:18:36,01:18:41,christies for 26 million pounds and so there's courses you can take now to train people for the
01:18:41,01:18:46,practical care of onboard art collection because everyone on board doesn't know how to look after
01:18:46,01:18:52,these you know so priceless pieces of art and they keep getting damaged when they're out at sea and
01:18:52,01:18:58,you know someone will pour um someone will pop a champagne bottle and a cork might hit a priceless
01:18:58,01:19:04,piece of art or in some cases there was one guy a john michelle basquiat who's an artist
01:19:04,01:19:07,who has little bits of corn flakes that are hanging off the paintings and they were very
01:19:07,01:19:11,worried that they were going to be ripped off thinking that maybe the kids on board had spilt
01:19:11,01:19:18,their corn flakes onto the painting itself um you can't you can't spill corn flakes onto a painting
01:19:18,01:19:24,that's hanging vertically on i don't know dad you've got kids how how far does the food fly
01:19:24,01:19:33,when it gets spilt exactly you very much can but that the ceiling fresco at the back of them is
01:19:33,01:19:39,just a ball of cocoa pops isn't it yeah i think if you're putting cereal on your paintings then
01:19:39,01:19:44,you shouldn't have an automatic right that it's taken seriously yeah well apparently in this
01:19:44,01:19:48,case it was a mistake he was eating corn flakes looking at his painting as he was laying on the
01:19:48,01:19:52,floor and it fell on it and it became part of the art is what they say in this article
01:19:52,01:19:58,but then one of the more famous ones is that um some millionaire or billionaire owners came back
01:19:58,01:20:03,onto their yacht and they've been told by that the captain had unwrapped a piece of art that had
01:20:03,01:20:09,arrived for them onto the yacht and had hung the painting on the wall and this was a horrific moment
01:20:09,01:20:14,to hear it because the piece of art that they'd unwrapped was a bit of art done by christo and
01:20:14,01:20:21,john claude and their way of doing art is they wrap things up so they just wrap stuff up and so
01:20:21,01:20:26,effectively the captain had taken the actual art off put it into a room with all the hot pipes and
01:20:26,01:20:30,then hung up this painting on the wall and you might know some of their work they did the the
01:20:30,01:20:34,rice stag in berlin they they wrapped the entire that's what they do they just go around wrapping
01:20:34,01:20:39,things so yeah so there's courses now for teaching you how to look after art on the high seas very
01:20:39,01:20:44,good so funny god i bet after that there was a famous dog he was called don the talking dog
01:20:44,01:20:52,and he was called the canine phenomenon phenomenon of the century he debuted in 1912
01:20:52,01:20:59,and he had a vocabulary that reached eight words what words were they well please don't say rough
01:20:59,01:21:06,and breathe back i think it was a bit like that they were all in german first of all
01:21:07,01:21:13,he could say he could say harbin he could say kuchen he could which means cake and the first one
01:21:13,01:21:20,means have uh he could say he could kind of say ja and nine and he could say ruha oh come on i need
01:21:20,01:21:27,a i need a recording of this or i will not believe well he was really saying he was absolutely
01:21:27,01:21:32,massive he was like he was when he came over to america so he was big in germany obviously like
01:21:32,01:21:37,you're gonna be big in germany if you speak german but when he came over to america there was a lot
01:21:37,01:21:42,of kind of german expats there and they were really excited and so they met him on the coming
01:21:42,01:21:48,off the ship a load of reporters and asked him for a quote which his owner said he was too seasick
01:21:48,01:21:54,to give a quote when he arrived but he was very impressed by new york but whenever he went on
01:21:54,01:22:01,stage he would kind of answer a series of questions presumably the answers were always harbin or kuchen
01:22:01,01:22:06,or something like that but the point was that he would make noises that sound a bit like it but
01:22:06,01:22:12,according to um the journal science someone did an actual paper on it they said that really he's
01:22:12,01:22:17,only just making noises and it's the people in the audience that are interpreting it as words
01:22:17,01:22:21,they sound a bit like words but obviously he doesn't really know what he's doing and it helps
01:22:21,01:22:27,that the german language sounds quite a lot more like a dog barking than sort of the spanish language
01:22:27,01:22:31,i mean you wouldn't get away with a big romantic language and a dog trying to impersonate that
01:22:31,01:22:36,you're absolutely right when i don't understand a question or i can't quite um determine what the
01:22:36,01:22:44,person said i give an answer that is uh in determined as well so it could be uh a sort of a mixture
01:22:44,01:22:49,of yes and no or or i'm not sure so you know and because i don't know what the person said but i
01:22:49,01:22:54,still want to respond because they're staring at me so i'll often say something like oh and
01:22:58,01:23:04,and they and they go are you sure and i'll go uh so that's just a little hint there for some people
01:23:04,01:23:10,you might want to it's a little little skill you can have that's sort of a halfway noise in russian
01:23:10,01:23:19,you can say yes no yes no which means no dan yet means no right as well and you see how we have a
01:23:19,01:23:25,term called oh yeah nah oh yeah probably heard of this one that's right yeah yeah so when people
01:23:25,01:23:31,say you go into the beach oh yeah nah and you what does that mean does that mean yes on well it means
01:23:31,01:23:37,you might but you just see how you go oh okay and they might say to you are you into it have
01:23:37,01:23:42,you seen this thing are you into it oh yeah you know you could be but you don't want to give it away
01:23:42,01:23:47,so it's a wonderful response because and then you can't you can't actually
01:23:47,01:23:53,respond again to that by law in new zealand so if you've received an oh yeah nah you can't go
01:23:53,01:23:56,look which is it because then you're just you're shunned i suppose you could just you could just
01:23:56,01:24:02,say maybe i guess it's a similar word no because then you're really giving it away that you're
01:24:02,01:24:09,not sure okay yeah all right it's not right yeah nah is is is the full spectrum okay very non-committal
01:24:09,01:24:14,country an entire country that's terrified of commitment that's actually that's actually an
01:24:14,01:24:22,option that's actually an option on the upcoming election ballot isn't it it is yeah yes no oh yeah
01:24:22,01:24:29,nah now even though it ends on nah this the the year part is going to be strong oh yeah no
01:24:29,01:24:34,oh really the way you say it well it is yeah there's different ways of saying it so i don't
01:24:34,01:24:39,assume it meant no in the end the one you end on seems to be the dominant one ask me ask me whether
01:24:39,01:24:46,it does oh does it just mean no right great should we get back to talking dogs
01:24:49,01:24:55,and the breath actually can be a problem in some places like the edvard monk museum in norway
01:24:55,01:25:01,they say that the scream is fading the screen which is his most famous work is fading because of
01:25:01,01:25:06,people's breath and that's because he used very cheap low quality paint he used cadmium sulfide
01:25:06,01:25:12,paints monk when he did his painting and it means that when you breathe on it it kind of gets worse
01:25:12,01:25:15,and worse and worse and they're trying to stop people from breathing and that means they should
01:25:15,01:25:22,they should replace it with the screen yeah the screen in front of the screen yeah very nice
01:25:22,01:25:30,sorry it was too good that i didn't like one of those ones i was afraid to breathe in front of
01:25:30,01:25:39,it in case in case the joke faded to the car should we um we can stop there actually
01:25:39,01:25:46,should we cast it yeah let's do that that was a great one no no it's fine i was only going to
01:25:46,01:25:51,talk about um taser tampons we could let's talk about taser tampons quickly yeah and then we
01:25:51,01:26:00,can move on after that i read the press store so some modern uh self-defense gadgets that obviously
01:26:00,01:26:05,it's still a bit of a growth area even though a lot of these things get released and they're not
01:26:05,01:26:12,legal to carry so there is a killer engagement ring with a particularly sharp cut diamond
01:26:12,01:26:17,an unbreakable umbrella which waks just as strong as a steel pipe but weighs only one pound and 11
01:26:17,01:26:25,ounces i think my favorite is the pink stinger which is a stun gun made to look like a tampon
01:26:25,01:26:32,it can deliver a 50 000 volt shock and can be used handheld or shot out to distances up to 14 feet
01:26:32,01:26:38,so that's that's a heck of a tampon i think i've seen that done in thailand actually um
01:26:38,01:26:48,so no but you don't wear it as a tampon before you fire it at your it's like a pink ball thing
01:26:48,01:26:54,no it's it's to be hidden within your handbag and nobody would know not presumably among your
01:26:54,01:27:00,other tampons yeah you don't want to accidentally get the wrong one do you yeah although if you've
01:27:00,01:27:03,got enemies and they ask for a tampon in the bathroom that's a hell of a prank
01:27:03,01:27:05,prank
01:27:05,01:27:16,50 000 volt prank prank goes wrong man doesn't understand what a prank is
01:27:16,01:27:24,lovely wow that's extraordinary those are all on the market we can yeah they're they're available
01:27:24,01:27:29,somewhere and i cannot guarantee that they are legal in in the territory in which you're currently
01:27:29,01:27:35,listening so please don't waste your money i got one last thing which is i was i like the idea of
01:27:35,01:27:40,the name center for north dakota so i just quickly looked into other names of north dakota to see if
01:27:40,01:27:46,there's any fun names and i found there's a place called flasher which is great in north dakota place
01:27:46,01:27:52,called zap and zap kind of the only major thing i could find that happened there was in 1969 there
01:27:52,01:27:58,was a movement called zip to zap where the mayor of zap suddenly found two to three thousand partiers
01:27:58,01:28:01,tearing up the streets and setting bonfires in the middle of them
01:28:01,01:28:06,to have this big party and they had to get the national garden to push them out
01:28:06,01:28:10,why was that called zip to zap i thought you were going to say the mayor zip wired into zap
01:28:10,01:28:18,no i think it was just a group of people that let's zip over to zap and have a massive party
01:28:18,01:28:23,is the uh i believe and then lastly a place called buttsville which is a cool name
01:28:23,01:28:31,but that is weird there's a lot of butts in um in that part of the world isn't there because um
01:28:31,01:28:38,butts like means uh it's like a raised bit of land or something so there's but yeah so in
01:28:38,01:28:44,montana and wyoming and dakota's there's loads of butts you're not going to believe this in south
01:28:44,01:28:50,dakota there is a place which was the original center of north america which was done by drawing
01:28:50,01:28:56,two lines and it is called snake butt really yeah and they put an obelisk on it uh and they
01:28:56,01:29:02,named it the approximate center of north america and um then in 1930 they changed their minds and
01:29:02,01:29:07,decided it was in rugby north dakota but it was snake butt a confusing name because it's actually
01:29:07,01:29:15,really hard to work out where a snake's butt is really is do you know what i said i was having a
01:29:15,01:29:20,look so i was going looking through some old books and uh maybe this is just me having sort of
01:29:20,01:29:24,locked down brain but i suddenly had a look at one of the poo and i hadn't realized quite how
01:29:24,01:29:27,philosophical it is so there's a wonderful bit where piglet and poo are sitting underneath the
01:29:27,01:29:34,big tree and piglet says what if this big tree falls down and poo says what if it doesn't and i
01:29:34,01:29:40,just thought it's a great attitude to life isn't it instead of catastrophizing and thinking what
01:29:40,01:29:44,if this terrible thing happens i like that attitude i mean or am i being ridiculous and
01:29:44,01:29:49,we don't know you're right i have to say it sounds like poo is praying for an end to the pain there
01:29:49,01:29:55,it sounds like he's taking piglet there on the assumption the tree will fall on them both
01:29:55,01:29:59,but i really like that why are we always worrying about the bad thing that's going to happen what
01:29:59,01:30:20,if yeah what if it doesn't we just sit here happily and not worry about bad things happening to it
