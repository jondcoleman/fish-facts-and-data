00:00:09,00:00:15,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast."
00:00:15,00:00:18,"This week, coming to you live from Dave's Lester Comedy Festival."
00:00:18,00:00:21,"My name is Dan Schreiber, and please welcome to the stage, it's Aniches Insky, James"
00:00:21,00:00:34,Harkin and Andy Murray.
00:00:34,00:00:39,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from"
00:00:39,00:00:42,"the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:42,00:00:47,"Starting with my fact, my fact this week is that when something thought to be a meteorite"
00:00:47,00:00:54,"actually turns out to be an ordinary rock, it's called a meteor wrong."
00:00:54,00:01:00,"So we were sent that fact in by someone called Molly Christie, she listens to the show,"
00:01:00,00:01:01,she sent it in.
00:01:01,00:01:07,"I was looking into it, it's not obviously a official scientific terminology, but if you"
00:01:07,00:01:11,"look into it, I've read AMAs on Reddit with meteorite experts, they all call it the"
00:01:11,00:01:12,meteorite.
00:01:12,00:01:13,It is quite a common thing.
00:01:13,00:01:17,"I went to the Natural History Museum a few years ago, and there's a kind of a department"
00:01:17,00:01:20,"there that if you have any weird stuff that you find in your garden or whatever, and you're"
00:01:20,00:01:22,"not sure what it is, you can send it to them."
00:01:22,00:01:27,"They do call them meteorongs, and they think that actually when people think they find meteorites,"
00:01:27,00:01:31,"it's almost always a meteorong, it's very rare that you actually do find a real one."
00:01:31,00:01:35,So the Natural History Museum has a room of meteorongs which are basically just rocks.
00:01:35,00:01:36,"Yeah, pretty much."
00:01:36,00:01:37,Pretty much.
00:01:37,00:01:38,"Yeah, they're gone."
00:01:38,00:01:46,"Yeah, there was a guy who was saying that, so he's at a University of Minnesota in America,"
00:01:46,00:01:50,"he's called Calvin Alexander, his university professor, and he's been asking people for"
00:01:50,00:01:55,"I think 30 years to come to him if they found a meteorite, they think they found a meteorite,"
00:01:55,00:02:01,"and he says he's seen thousands, more than 5,000 meteorongs, he's retiring next year, never"
00:02:01,00:02:04,yet has someone brought him something that's turned out to be a meteorite.
00:02:04,00:02:09,"Until this year, a couple of them had a thing in their garden that they'd actually found"
00:02:09,00:02:12,"a couple of years ago, and they said actually this looks a bit weird, brought it in."
00:02:12,00:02:13,There you go.
00:02:13,00:02:14,This is first ever meteorite.
00:02:14,00:02:15,That's really cool.
00:02:15,00:02:21,"Oh, we should say what a meteorite is because I wasn't sure, so a meteorite is a chunk"
00:02:21,00:02:26,"of rock flying through space, and then if it enters the Earth's atmosphere, it's a meteor,"
00:02:26,00:02:30,"but then if a bit lands, then that becomes a meteorite, yeah, so it can be three different"
00:02:30,00:02:32,"things, depending on where it is, yeah."
00:02:32,00:02:36,"And we get about 44 tons of meteorites falling on the planet every day, so you'd think there"
00:02:36,00:02:37,would be more.
00:02:37,00:02:41,"We do, there's a ridiculous number, I think it's 4 billion a year, loud or not, they're"
00:02:41,00:02:45,"mostly, I think, really, really small, but it's a lot."
00:02:45,00:02:50,Do you know how you can tell if you're out in the wild looking at rocks trying to find
00:02:50,00:02:52,meteorites if it is one?
00:02:52,00:02:53,No.
00:02:53,00:02:56,"So the magnetic, okay."
00:02:56,00:03:00,"Yeah, so if you have a little magnet with you, a little fridge magnet is something, if there's"
00:03:00,00:03:04,"a magnetic pull against it, that doesn't, it still might, there are lots of it, it could"
00:03:04,00:03:08,"be like a radiator or something, there's lots of things out there."
00:03:08,00:03:13,"So that's the thing, there are a lot of rocks that are just normal terrestrial rocks that"
00:03:13,00:03:17,"are also magnetic, so don't just go around with them, you know, with a magnet trying to find"
00:03:17,00:03:18,one.
00:03:18,00:03:22,"That's what, so I got really excited when they said, yeah, if it's magnetic, then it's definitely"
00:03:22,00:03:25,"a meteorite, except for the fact that a lot of rocks are magnetic, so it may just turn"
00:03:25,00:03:26,out to be a rock.
00:03:26,00:03:30,"However, if it's not magnetic, it could be a rock from Mars or from the Moon, which is"
00:03:30,00:03:35,"even rarer, however, it could also just be a rock, so it doesn't sound like they've"
00:03:35,00:03:37,cracked the perfect method.
00:03:37,00:03:41,I once wrote to a meteorite expert a few years ago and asked him what you should do if one
00:03:41,00:03:45,"land, because there's a common misconception that meteorites are hot when they land, but"
00:03:45,00:03:48,"they're not, because they've just gone through space, which is really cold."
00:03:48,00:03:51,"And then they have gone through the atmosphere, so warmed up a bit, but they should have had"
00:03:51,00:03:53,plenty of time to cool down.
00:03:53,00:03:58,"So you could actually conceivably get a frostbite from touching a meteorite, like that, and"
00:03:58,00:03:59,hold on the inside.
00:03:59,00:04:01,"But when I wrote to this guy and said, what should you actually do?"
00:04:01,00:04:05,"He said, whatever you do, don't touch it, you want to get a kind of a plastic bag and"
00:04:05,00:04:08,"then put it down, because just you touching it could contaminate it, I mean, it's not very"
00:04:08,00:04:09,good for science.
00:04:09,00:04:11,Don't touch those meteorites.
00:04:11,00:04:19,"I met an explorer over Skype called Charles Brewer Carias, amazing character, quite controversial"
00:04:19,00:04:20,character.
00:04:20,00:04:24,"The explorer and up was said to be based on him, you know, in the Pixar movie up, the guy"
00:04:24,00:04:26,living in the Venezuelan mountains said to be based on him.
00:04:26,00:04:30,"He's famous for a number of things and a lot of discoveries, including he told me that"
00:04:30,00:04:35,"he discovered what he thinks is the lost city of gold, and he did it while he was having"
00:04:35,00:04:39,"a poo in the woods, and he said to me, he said to me, I looked in between my legs and saw"
00:04:39,00:04:50,"something spectacular, but he also told me that he's discovered this glowing coral, glowing"
00:04:50,00:04:56,"coral, which is the oldest life form on this planet, and he said that he arrived via space"
00:04:56,00:04:59,"meteorites, and so it's now living on Earth, an extraterrestrial."
00:04:59,00:05:04,"Is this how trustworthy is this guy, is he friends with your yeti hunting friends and your"
00:05:04,00:05:05,ghost seeking friends?
00:05:05,00:05:06,I don't know.
00:05:06,00:05:10,"He said, he was like a biologist came in and said that this is definitely the oldest form"
00:05:10,00:05:14,"of life, and actually it feels like it's from out of space, and then I emailed the biologist"
00:05:14,00:05:19,and she said there's about as much exo-biology in it as there is in my foot.
00:05:19,00:05:24,"So he must have heard it wrong kind of thing, but actually in the hills of all of Venezuela,"
00:05:24,00:05:30,"she had an amazing foot, full of aliens."
00:05:30,00:05:34,"To not the Cambodian thing you shout when a meteorite arrives is star poo, is what you"
00:05:34,00:05:35,say.
00:05:35,00:05:39,"Archpecai, that's what happened when one landed in Cambodia in 2014."
00:05:39,00:05:40,Is that what they call them?
00:05:40,00:05:45,"Well loads of people shouted, the local, commercial people shouted star poo, so that's an official"
00:05:45,00:05:46,scientific name.
00:05:46,00:05:47,Right here on.
00:05:47,00:05:48,Yeah.
00:05:48,00:05:49,Wow.
00:05:49,00:05:54,"There was a, the R&I launched a really big search and rescue operation last year, I"
00:05:54,00:05:59,"think, because of a meteor flying through the sky, and they thought it was a distress"
00:05:59,00:06:00,flurbing sent up by a ship.
00:06:00,00:06:04,"There was an emergency operation, this was off the Cambrian coast, I think."
00:06:04,00:06:07,"And I think, you know, it takes quite a lot of money, and they went out there and then gradually"
00:06:07,00:06:10,reports that are coming through from the rest of the country saying there's this flur
00:06:10,00:06:14,"going across the sky everywhere, and it turned out, yep, no one's dying."
00:06:14,00:06:20,Which is actually good news in way.
00:06:20,00:06:24,"In the late 18th century in France, they didn't think that the Academy of France said they"
00:06:24,00:06:27,didn't think that meteorites could possibly exist.
00:06:27,00:06:32,"Supposedly what they said was, there are no rocks in the sky, therefore rocks cannot fall"
00:06:32,00:06:33,from the sky.
00:06:33,00:06:34,And they decided.
00:06:34,00:06:36,The logic is actually infallible.
00:06:36,00:06:40,"Yeah, it's true, but that's apparently what they said, and apparently they, it meant"
00:06:40,00:06:44,"that they didn't do any kind of studies on possible meteorites, because if someone said"
00:06:44,00:06:49,"they found one and saw one land, they were like, well, duh, obviously not real."
00:06:49,00:06:55,"But then in 1803, more than 2,000 meteorites fell in a single village in Normandy, and so"
00:06:55,00:06:58,they had to kind of change their mind a little.
00:06:58,00:06:59,Wow.
00:06:59,00:07:01,"Yeah, apparently that's a story, I don't know if it's true."
00:07:01,00:07:02,It's very cool.
00:07:02,00:07:03,Yeah.
00:07:03,00:07:09,There was a meteorite fell through the roof of a house owned by the Comet family recently.
00:07:09,00:07:11,I think it was two years ago.
00:07:11,00:07:13,"That was nice, isn't it?"
00:07:13,00:07:15,"Comet, I think they're French."
00:07:15,00:07:18,You didn't read anything more on that story than the effects.
00:07:18,00:07:19,"No, why would I?"
00:07:19,00:07:21,It's only going to get worse from there.
00:07:21,00:07:24,So we need to move on quite soon to our next fact.
00:07:24,00:07:28,"Okay, can I do just a quick thing, a new story that I read."
00:07:28,00:07:33,A Bosnian man had his house hit five times by meteorites in less than six months a few
00:07:33,00:07:35,years ago.
00:07:35,00:07:39,"Experts at the local university were like, well, maybe there's like a magnetic anomaly"
00:07:39,00:07:40,or something like that.
00:07:40,00:07:47,"But he thought that he said, I'm obviously being targeted by extraterrestrials."
00:07:47,00:07:52,"I don't know what I've done to annoy them, but there is no other explanation that makes sense."
00:07:52,00:07:56,The chance of being hit by a meteorite is so small that getting hit five times has to
00:07:56,00:07:59,be deliberate.
00:07:59,00:08:07,"Okay, let's move on to our second fact of the show and that is Andy Murray."
00:08:07,00:08:12,My fact this week is that Brown Falkans commit arson.
00:08:12,00:08:16,So these Australian birds are kind of Falkan and there are two species.
00:08:16,00:08:21,Brown Falkans and black kites and they've been observed picking up when they're wildfires.
00:08:21,00:08:25,They've been observed picking up smoldering bits of branch and twig and carrying them to
00:08:25,00:08:30,"new locations and starting fires in new areas, which then makes all the little creatures"
00:08:30,00:08:33,in the undergrowth run out so that they can kill them and eat them.
00:08:33,00:08:38,So this is deliberate fire starting as a way of getting food.
00:08:38,00:08:43,"And it's all so far, it's not been observed, it's not been filmed and it's anecdotal evidence"
00:08:43,00:08:48,"from park rangers, Aboriginal Australians and Australian firemen."
00:08:48,00:08:51,"So it could be made up, couldn't it?"
00:08:51,00:08:54,"I don't think it's made up, but I think it needs to be observed properly."
00:08:54,00:08:58,"It seems likely though, it doesn't make sense because they rely on fires for their food"
00:08:58,00:08:59,"very often, don't they?"
00:08:59,00:09:00,Those types of birds.
00:09:00,00:09:01,It makes sense.
00:09:01,00:09:05,It reminds me of a thing we did a radio show with a guy called Rupert Sheldrake a
00:09:05,00:09:11,few years ago and he said that people anecdotally have said that when sheep want to get across
00:09:11,00:09:16,"a cattle grid, they kind of roll over on the cattle grid to get from one side to the other."
00:09:16,00:09:21,"And he said, ""Nodes of people have seen this happening, but actually we think probably"
00:09:21,00:09:22,it never happened.
00:09:22,00:09:23,"It might be just a story."""
00:09:23,00:09:27,What they noticed was someone started reporting it in one bit of Australia and then a few
00:09:27,00:09:31,"days later, sheep across the country started doing it as if there was some kind of secret"
00:09:31,00:09:35,sheep whispering network that managed to spread.
00:09:35,00:09:38,"But it's, yeah, so it sounds like it's in the Sheldrake area slightly, I guess."
00:09:38,00:09:43,"But actually, these people who have been talking about it are, like you say, the park rangers"
00:09:43,00:09:46,and people who kind of would know that kind of thing.
00:09:46,00:09:52,"Yeah, so it would be very, very good to know if it does happen, so there's more research"
00:09:52,00:09:54,"being done, basically, and more observation being done."
00:09:54,00:09:58,"The one of the co-authors of it, Mark Bonta, has suggested that humans might have learnt"
00:09:58,00:10:05,"about spreading fires from birds, which seems less likely."
00:10:05,00:10:09,"Yeah, because they have to carry them quite small distances while they're still smoldering,"
00:10:09,00:10:13,"obviously, because if you fly far, then it'll go out."
00:10:13,00:10:20,"If we learn about carrying fire from birds, we overtook them so fast, but still that occasionally"
00:10:20,00:10:25,"picking up a burning ember, we've got one by a night."
00:10:25,00:10:26,"Does that happen, though?"
00:10:26,00:10:31,"So in 2014, Pigeon in Stockwell did start a fire by dropping a cigarette in its nest,"
00:10:31,00:10:32,so.
00:10:32,00:10:33,"Oh, I did it."
00:10:33,00:10:35,"Well, we don't know."
00:10:35,00:10:40,"I've read about this new Kickstarter that's been fully funded where you can now, if you're"
00:10:40,00:10:45,"out in the camping or whatever, it's this little kit where you light a fire and it heats"
00:10:45,00:10:49,up this pad that creates a battery charge for your iPhone.
00:10:49,00:10:53,"So you've got an external iPhone charger now, or smartphone charger, which plugs in"
00:10:53,00:10:55,to a fire source to give you what it's.
00:10:55,00:10:56,"Yeah, it's not really cool."
00:10:56,00:10:57,That is smart.
00:10:57,00:10:58,It's very cool.
00:10:58,00:10:59,Yeah.
00:10:59,00:11:05,"I mean, fire, actually some humans still can't make fire, or until the 20th century, there"
00:11:05,00:11:08,are tribes that had still hadn't learned how to make fire.
00:11:08,00:11:15,"So there are the, for instance, FA and Booty pigmies that I think pigmy tribes that are in"
00:11:15,00:11:20,"the Democratic Republic of the Congo, they, we think they could make fire thousands of years"
00:11:20,00:11:21,ago.
00:11:21,00:11:22,There's some evidence for that.
00:11:22,00:11:23,But it seems like they've forgotten.
00:11:23,00:11:26,"Now, it's part of tribal tradition that you have to carry around a burning ember with"
00:11:26,00:11:27,you all the time.
00:11:27,00:11:33,"So you get fire from, like if there's a lightning storm in the forest, then a tree sets on fire,"
00:11:33,00:11:34,and you pick up that.
00:11:34,00:11:37,"And it's the women's job in these tribes to carry around this burning ember, and they have"
00:11:37,00:11:42,"to wrap it up, you know, dump leaves when they move from one campsite to the next so that"
00:11:42,00:11:43,they keep this fire.
00:11:43,00:11:45,"Because if the fire goes out, it's like, we've got no fire."
00:11:45,00:11:46,Just waiting for the next storm.
00:11:46,00:11:47,"Waiting for the next storm, yeah."
00:11:47,00:11:48,Isn't that weird?
00:11:48,00:11:49,Yeah.
00:11:49,00:11:50,Yeah.
00:11:50,00:11:55,"And then I think some anthropologists turned off about 20 years ago and said, guys."
00:11:55,00:11:58,"I was reading about some other unusual birds, cool birds."
00:11:58,00:11:59,"Oh, yeah."
00:11:59,00:12:05,"And so, baby grey cat birds, they get their name because they make her noise like a cat."
00:12:05,00:12:09,"They kind of do a little meow, which sounds great, but it's not really great for them because"
00:12:09,00:12:10,it just attracts cats.
00:12:10,00:12:11,[LAUGHTER]
00:12:11,00:12:12,That is it.
00:12:12,00:12:15,"I must say, the evolutionary of the time."
00:12:15,00:12:16,Exactly.
00:12:16,00:12:22,"And in 2011, they did a study, and they found that domestic cats were responsible for nearly"
00:12:22,00:12:24,half of all deaths of these birds.
00:12:24,00:12:25,"Oh, my God."
00:12:25,00:12:26,"Oh, my God."
00:12:26,00:12:27,Here's another one.
00:12:27,00:12:30,There's a hummingbird called Anna's hummingbird.
00:12:30,00:12:31,"Oh, yeah."
00:12:31,00:12:32,"Yeah, so I'm not."
00:12:32,00:12:33,Yeah.
00:12:33,00:12:34,Didn't want to come tonight.
00:12:34,00:12:40,"Anna's hummingbird can shake their bodies 55 times per second, which is the fastest shake"
00:12:40,00:12:42,of any vertebrae known.
00:12:42,00:12:47,"Just back to the sounds, I was reading about a bird that's called the Fortail Drongo."
00:12:47,00:12:52,And this bird has the ability to mimic other animals and other birds.
00:12:52,00:12:56,"And what it does is it lets out, it's learned the call of those danger nearby."
00:12:56,00:13:00,"So if it feels like, it's so basically, it's so that they can steal food off other animals."
00:13:00,00:13:06,"So they'll be like, ""Danger's coming,"" and then they'll say it like a cat or like a hamster"
00:13:06,00:13:07,or something.
00:13:07,00:13:08,"Oh, like a human."
00:13:08,00:13:09,Could they say danger's coming?
00:13:09,00:13:10,I think they've mastered human.
00:13:10,00:13:11,I think they've mastered human.
00:13:11,00:13:12,Yeah.
00:13:12,00:13:14,"And so these things run off, and then they get the food."
00:13:14,00:13:19,But they've learned to both lie and not lie when there is actual danger.
00:13:19,00:13:23,"So they've kept animals on their toes when they hear it and go, ""Oh, it's probably that"
00:13:23,00:13:24,"dickhead bird."""
00:13:24,00:13:28,They can actually then get eaten because it wasn't telling us that.
00:13:28,00:13:29,It's cry wolf.
00:13:29,00:13:30,Yes.
00:13:30,00:13:31,But sometimes there is a wolf.
00:13:31,00:13:32,Yeah.
00:13:32,00:13:35,You obviously never read to the end of the story of cry wolf.
00:13:35,00:13:38,I got the gist of it.
00:13:38,00:13:39,The same thing.
00:13:39,00:13:40,You just get happy.
00:13:40,00:13:41,"Oh my, this is boring."
00:13:41,00:13:42,Oh my god.
00:13:42,00:13:43,Oh my god.
00:13:43,00:13:44,Cookies.
00:13:44,00:13:46,So I was looking at a bird's committing crimes.
00:13:46,00:13:51,"These birds commit arson, cookies are obviously very famous criminal birds, you know, put their"
00:13:51,00:13:56,"eggs in other birds' nest and disguise them as other birds' eggs, and then the egg hatches"
00:13:56,00:13:58,and it tips all the real eggs out of the nest.
00:13:58,00:13:59,And that's that.
00:13:59,00:14:04,"So they're murderers and kind of house thieves, but other birds are getting really wise"
00:14:04,00:14:05,to it.
00:14:05,00:14:10,So they've cookies have evolved to make their eggs mimic the eggs of whatever bird who's
00:14:10,00:14:11,nest they want to steal.
00:14:11,00:14:16,So the eggs look identical to our human eyes to the bird who's nest they want to steal
00:14:16,00:14:22,"eggs, but birds, other birds have now developed evolved really super sensitive infrared type"
00:14:22,00:14:23,vision.
00:14:23,00:14:27,So they can see really subtle differences in cookies eggs that completely distinguish them
00:14:27,00:14:28,from their own eggs.
00:14:28,00:14:30,So they're getting the better of them gradually.
00:14:30,00:14:31,That's very cool.
00:14:31,00:14:36,But then the cookies will probably evolve again to beat that and it's actually.
00:14:36,00:14:37,It's a race.
00:14:37,00:14:38,Yeah.
00:14:38,00:14:41,"Well, I can't be evolved to build their own nests one day, you know."
00:14:41,00:14:47,"Actually, I think of all the cuckoo species, I think most of them don't do that parasitic thing."
00:14:47,00:14:50,"The ones in Europe do, but around the world, I think most of them don't."
00:14:50,00:14:51,"Yeah, that's true."
00:14:51,00:14:56,"And last month in Israeli culture was arrested, it lebanon for spying."
00:14:56,00:14:57,So.
00:14:57,00:14:58,Happily?
00:14:58,00:14:59,No.
00:14:59,00:15:01,"And is it, was it charged?"
00:15:01,00:15:02,It.
00:15:02,00:15:03,"No, I don't think so."
00:15:03,00:15:04,I think it was eventually released.
00:15:04,00:15:06,So what kind of interrogation happened that they were?
00:15:06,00:15:08,"No, you didn't do it, did you?"
00:15:08,00:15:09,You've been framed.
00:15:09,00:15:15,It had a location transmitter and an Israeli identification tag on it.
00:15:15,00:15:20,"So I suppose the thinking was that Israeli spies would have written ""This is a spy"" on"
00:15:20,00:15:21,a bird.
00:15:21,00:15:22,Yeah.
00:15:22,00:15:29,"In 1471, a chicken in Basel was found guilty of laying a brightly coloured egg, which"
00:15:29,00:15:32,was thought to be indefiance of natural law.
00:15:32,00:15:34,What was the penalty?
00:15:34,00:15:36,"Unfortunately, it wasn't let free like the Israeli one."
00:15:36,00:15:39,It was burned to death at the stake.
00:15:39,00:15:40,Oh.
00:15:40,00:15:42,It was just a vicious stake.
00:15:42,00:15:47,And so Nandos was born.
00:15:47,00:15:51,I found a bird that I'd never heard of before.
00:15:51,00:15:52,It's a Tibetan black bird.
00:15:52,00:15:53,This is its name.
00:15:53,00:15:54,Turdus Maximus.
00:15:54,00:15:56,It's an actual bird.
00:15:56,00:15:59,"All COVID birds are the turdus genus, aren't they?"
00:15:59,00:16:00,I don't know.
00:16:00,00:16:01,Is that genus?
00:16:01,00:16:02,Russian are all turdus.
00:16:02,00:16:03,"So they're turdus, I think?"
00:16:03,00:16:04,They're turdus turdus.
00:16:04,00:16:07,So COVID is a crow's and--
00:16:07,00:16:08,COVID is the best.
00:16:08,00:16:12,"The crow's ravens, magpies, all birds like that, and they're so intelligent."
00:16:12,00:16:17,So this fact is kind of about birds are preyed learning how to use tools in a way.
00:16:17,00:16:19,And COVID is amazing at using tools.
00:16:19,00:16:26,"So there was one experiment where a crow was-- it was given a piece of wire, and it managed"
00:16:26,00:16:31,to bend this piece of wire into a hook using a glass kind of beaker that was nearby.
00:16:31,00:16:34,So it pushed the glass beaker against a wall so that it bent this bit of wire into
00:16:34,00:16:35,a hook.
00:16:35,00:16:39,"It ordered it could hook a stick that was slightly out of its reach, and it hooked the stick"
00:16:39,00:16:40,towards it.
00:16:40,00:16:43,And then it took the long stick with which it was able to get the food that it wanted to
00:16:43,00:16:44,get.
00:16:44,00:16:45,"That's impressive, isn't it?"
00:16:45,00:16:46,That's really impressive.
00:16:46,00:16:52,"I don't know why I couldn't just fly over and pick up the food, but it was challenging itself."
00:16:52,00:16:54,We're going to have to move on really shortly.
00:16:54,00:16:55,So anything else before we do?
00:16:55,00:17:02,"Koalas to escape forest fires, their instinctive reaction is to crawl up a tree, so they often"
00:17:02,00:17:05,have to get rescued by Australian fire fighters.
00:17:05,00:17:06,They're badly evolved.
00:17:06,00:17:07,Yeah.
00:17:07,00:17:11,"But they presumably move really slowly, so that's their best bet I'm guessing."
00:17:11,00:17:16,"I would never picture like a herd of koalas coming out, because the fighter was approaching"
00:17:16,00:17:17,them.
00:17:17,00:17:18,Yeah.
00:17:18,00:17:22,"All right, let's move on to our third fact of the evening, and that is Chisinski."
00:17:22,00:17:29,"Yeah, my fact is that in 1461, the mayor of Haien in Spain donated 10,000 eggs to his"
00:17:29,00:17:33,"citizens, so they can have a huge food fight."
00:17:33,00:17:34,It's nice of him.
00:17:34,00:17:35,He's a good guy.
00:17:35,00:17:41,"This is a guy called Constable Don Miguel Lucas de Aranzo, and he decided for Easter, Easter"
00:17:41,00:17:47,"celebration, give his people this big food fight, and he built this huge fake wooden castle"
00:17:47,00:17:51,"that he wheeled into the city centre, and I think he then hold himself up in his house"
00:17:51,00:17:55,"with some of his guards, and he was like to the townspeople, said, you get in this castle,"
00:17:55,00:17:58,"and let's pelt each other with eggs for a while, and they did it."
00:17:58,00:18:02,"And then they did it again on Mayday, because they enjoyed it so much, and for a few stops"
00:18:02,00:18:03,for a few years.
00:18:03,00:18:06,"It does kind of feel like a thing that should have carried on forever, doesn't it?"
00:18:06,00:18:07,Yes.
00:18:07,00:18:08,Because it does sound like the most fun thing ever.
00:18:08,00:18:09,Yeah.
00:18:09,00:18:10,One must have happened to stop it.
00:18:10,00:18:14,"I feel like he, because it always seems to be him throughout the 1460s, so maybe when"
00:18:14,00:18:18,"he left office, he sounds like maybe the Boris Johnson of the 15th century, he probably"
00:18:18,00:18:22,"has some dodgy policies, but did a lot of fun stuff on the side, but won the people"
00:18:22,00:18:23,round.
00:18:23,00:18:26,"I read that in one of the other fights that he had, that there was such a surplus of"
00:18:26,00:18:29,food that people then started hitting each other with chickens.
00:18:29,00:18:30,No.
00:18:30,00:18:31,No.
00:18:31,00:18:32,Yeah.
00:18:32,00:18:33,Why don't you hit someone with a chicken?
00:18:33,00:18:35,"It's just an older rag, isn't it?"
00:18:35,00:18:36,Oh.
00:18:36,00:18:40,"Waiter, I think this egg is off."
00:18:40,00:18:44,"Sir, you come into Dando's every day and say that."
00:18:44,00:18:48,"There were boiled eggs, I think, which sounds a bit less fun."
00:18:48,00:18:49,"Oh, right."
00:18:49,00:18:50,Yeah.
00:18:50,00:18:51,I've read mixed.
00:18:51,00:18:53,There's a lot of controversy over the type of egg.
00:18:53,00:18:54,"Oh, really?"
00:18:54,00:18:58,"Some also say boiled, some say just raw, but it's so hard to tell from the outside, isn't"
00:18:58,00:18:59,it?
00:18:59,00:19:00,Yeah.
00:19:00,00:19:07,"Actually, there is a game called Egg Roulette, which, so I think this is part of the Lincoln"
00:19:07,00:19:10,"Share World Egg Throwing Championships, which are a massive deal."
00:19:10,00:19:12,We've probably all tried to get tickets at some point.
00:19:12,00:19:17,"And they have stuff like the World Egg Trebuchet and Egg Throwing, obviously."
00:19:17,00:19:22,"And then one of the contests is Egg Roulette, which involves you sit at a table with one"
00:19:22,00:19:25,"of the person and you've got a whole bunch of eggs laid out in front of you, and they're"
00:19:25,00:19:28,"all boiled except one, and you take it in turns to select one and smash it against your"
00:19:28,00:19:29,forehead.
00:19:29,00:19:32,And then you get covered in raw egg when you pick the wrong one.
00:19:32,00:19:34,"It's not as dangerous as Russian roulette, but..."
00:19:34,00:19:39,"But you're still covered in, but you're still covered in sort of boiled egg when it's"
00:19:39,00:19:40,not great.
00:19:40,00:19:41,It's not a good result.
00:19:41,00:19:42,It's not ideal.
00:19:42,00:19:45,"And the egg throw in itself, it's quite good."
00:19:45,00:19:50,"It's what happens is your ten meters away from your friend, you chuck him the egg or"
00:19:50,00:19:54,"she, and they have to catch it and not break it."
00:19:54,00:19:57,"And then everyone does that, and everyone who does it right and it doesn't break, then they"
00:19:57,00:20:00,go to 20 meters and then 30 meters and then 40 meters.
00:20:00,00:20:01,"So it's quite a cool game though, isn't it?"
00:20:01,00:20:03,I reckon you should have a little later on.
00:20:03,00:20:07,"Well, that rules that you have to throw it fairly towards them, because you could throw"
00:20:07,00:20:10,"it off a bit, and then they find a very difficult..."
00:20:10,00:20:11,"You're in a team, so you actually..."
00:20:11,00:20:12,"Yeah, you're watching the catch it."
00:20:12,00:20:13,You want to see.
00:20:13,00:20:14,That's why your team keeps losing.
00:20:14,00:20:17,I'm going to get that guy this time.
00:20:17,00:20:20,Are you allowed to use an apron to catch it?
00:20:20,00:20:23,"The apron, I think, with your hands, it has to be."
00:20:23,00:20:26,"And they also have very strict drug rules as well, according to the website."
00:20:26,00:20:31,"No, they say that, like any sport, you're not allowed any performance in enhancing drugs,"
00:20:31,00:20:38,"but they do say that the local happyjack real ale is not only permitted, but recommended."
00:20:38,00:20:47,"I was reading about being egged, the phenomenon of being egged, being egged."
00:20:47,00:20:49,It's a fun thing to say.
00:20:49,00:20:54,"There was a 2006 study, which was called, ""Here's egg in your eye, a prospective study of"
00:20:54,00:20:57,"blunt oculotroma resulting from thrown eggs."""
00:20:57,00:21:02,"This was a real study, and it just concluded, ""Don't do it."""
00:21:02,00:21:06,"I mean, how have people been oculotly traumatised frequently?"
00:21:06,00:21:07,"Yes, really."
00:21:07,00:21:08,"Not frequently, no."
00:21:08,00:21:09,But it does happen.
00:21:09,00:21:10,Very seldom.
00:21:10,00:21:19,"This is Janu Kovic, the president of the Ukraine, got struck with a brick, was rushed to hospital"
00:21:19,00:21:21,"because he'd been struck with a brick, and it transpired when people looked."
00:21:21,00:21:24,"But I think they look back over the footage, and it has just been an egg."
00:21:24,00:21:29,So it is apparently more dangerous and hard hitting than they look.
00:21:29,00:21:30,Yeah.
00:21:30,00:21:31,Wow.
00:21:31,00:21:32,So he didn't look at the debris around him.
00:21:32,00:21:33,He just assumed it was a brick.
00:21:33,00:21:38,"I think, I guess, maybe he has serious oculotomage and could no longer see who's surrounding."
00:21:38,00:21:39,I don't agree.
00:21:39,00:21:40,You don't get egged.
00:21:40,00:21:41,You get yogoted.
00:21:41,00:21:43,It's called the Ayur-Turma.
00:21:43,00:21:44,Don't write in.
00:21:44,00:21:49,"Yeah, like yogate, the Ayur-Turma."
00:21:49,00:21:53,"And it's a specific kind of yogate that they use, which is sheep's milk yogate."
00:21:53,00:21:58,That's really good for Ayur-Turma-ing people because you're sort of reminding people that
00:21:58,00:22:03,the Greek and that they've shamed Greekness by trying Greek yoghurt.
00:22:03,00:22:07,"So when you say the special kind, do you go into a shop, say, ""Do you have any yoghurt?"""
00:22:07,00:22:15,"And they say, ""Is this for eating or for assaulting in politicians?"""
00:22:15,00:22:17,"They're in the top left corner, yeah."
00:22:17,00:22:22,"Oh, there was quite a vicious food fight in 1818 in Harvard, apparently."
00:22:22,00:22:26,"This was an era of quite a lot of student protests in America, I think."
00:22:26,00:22:31,"And yeah, this food fight started when someone threw a slice of buttered bread and it ended"
00:22:31,00:22:32,up going mad for days.
00:22:32,00:22:36,"And like, all the crocker, all harbours crockery was smashed, lots of plates and chairs were"
00:22:36,00:22:39,"thrown at each other, lots of furniture broken."
00:22:39,00:22:44,"There was, a lot of students were suspended unsurprisingly and then all the other students"
00:22:44,00:22:46,who hadn't been suspended went and protested.
00:22:46,00:22:47,One of them was Emerson.
00:22:47,00:22:50,Ralph Aldoemerson was there at the time and he protested and went stood under a tree and
00:22:50,00:22:54,"they sort of mobbed all the tutors and said, ""How dare you suspend students for breaking"
00:22:54,00:22:58,"all the furniture in this place, smashing all the crockery."""
00:22:58,00:23:00,And yet apparently this is quite a common occurrence.
00:23:00,00:23:03,So they let them all back in because they were upset.
00:23:03,00:23:04,Wow.
00:23:04,00:23:08,"Hey, let's move on to our final fact of the show and that is James Harkin."
00:23:08,00:23:15,"Okay, my fact this week is that in 1951, Australia's football team played against England and lost"
00:23:15,00:23:16,17 nil.
00:23:16,00:23:21,The goalkeeper was called Norman Conquest.
00:23:21,00:23:28,"What a great name, Norman Conquest, I love it and he's quite a famous goalkeeper he's"
00:23:28,00:23:32,in the Australian Hall of Fame but he's most famous for being in this one game where they
00:23:32,00:23:35,got absolutely annihilated by England.
00:23:35,00:23:37,"Well 17 nil, but how did he..."
00:23:37,00:23:40,There was a report written by a guy called Tugger Bryant.
00:23:40,00:23:46,It was another form of footballer and he said that Australia could not handle the mud.
00:23:46,00:23:48,"It was a really, really muddy pitch."
00:23:48,00:23:52,Australia could not handle the mud whereas England reveled in it and rang rings around
00:23:52,00:23:54,the Australians.
00:23:54,00:23:58,Our players spent more time on their backs in the mud than on their feet.
00:23:58,00:24:02,The only time they were on their feet was when the band played God save the Queen.
00:24:02,00:24:09,"So yeah, the English team could kind of deal with their heavy conditions but the Australians"
00:24:09,00:24:10,just weren't used to it.
00:24:10,00:24:14,I looked up more excellent football than names from history.
00:24:14,00:24:15,"Oh yeah, of course."
00:24:15,00:24:22,"So Reading in the 17s had a goalkeeper called Steve Death and just outside the goalie arena,"
00:24:22,00:24:25,"there's Zimbabwean defender, I'm sure you'll have heard of him, James, called Danger"
00:24:25,00:24:33,Forpence. It's gun-end chap called Naughty Naughty.
00:24:33,00:24:34,Amazing.
00:24:34,00:24:38,That's a brilliant striker called Creedence Clearwater Cuto because his parents were such
00:24:38,00:24:41,fans of Creedence Clearwater Revival.
00:24:41,00:24:44,"Yeah, he's my feminist, he's called everyone calls him Paul Easter, I think."
00:24:44,00:24:45,Do they?
00:24:45,00:24:46,Yeah.
00:24:46,00:24:48,"Australia, now obviously quite a decent team, aren't they?"
00:24:48,00:24:49,It's such a good team.
00:24:49,00:24:53,"Because that's from Australia or was brought up in Australia, weren't you?"
00:24:53,00:24:58,"So here, you're a fan of the soccer rules, and we watched the games in the last World Cup"
00:24:58,00:24:59,in the QI office.
00:24:59,00:25:03,"When they lost 17 nil, it was a record defeat, I think, of any team in an international game."
00:25:03,00:25:11,But now Australia holds the record win when they beat American Samoa 31 nil in 2001.
00:25:11,00:25:16,But what happened there was the American Samoa team all had passport issues and so all but
00:25:16,00:25:20,one of the players were ineligible to play because they couldn't get out of the cage
00:25:20,00:25:25,and they couldn't call up any of their under 20 team because they were all doing exams at
00:25:25,00:25:31,"the time and so they had to just draft in all these really, really young or inexperienced"
00:25:31,00:25:37,"players, including three, fifteen year olds and at the end of the game, the stadium showed"
00:25:37,00:25:43,that the score was 32 nil because everyone had lost count of them because of that record.
00:25:43,00:25:47,There's always a little caveat for any international glory for Australian sports.
00:25:47,00:25:48,It's so annoying.
00:25:48,00:25:50,Do you remember the Olympics?
00:25:50,00:25:55,"It was that speed racer guy on, so he was a speed skater, right?"
00:25:55,00:26:01,"Yeah, speed skater and he was coming last in the heats and, or I think it was, he'd made"
00:26:01,00:26:04,it through the heats and he was in the semis and as they came round the corner on the last
00:26:04,00:26:08,"bit, he was way in behind, someone tripped in front, took out everyone."
00:26:08,00:26:13,"He was so far back that he could dodge right around, came first, made it to the finals."
00:26:13,00:26:17,"So everyone was going, there was no way this guy should ever be here, but here he is now."
00:26:17,00:26:23,"The finals gets round to the same corner, he's way behind, same thing happens, he took over"
00:26:23,00:26:30,"it and just walked in to gold, first up to gold that we've got and he got it because both"
00:26:30,00:26:31,tied.
00:26:31,00:26:36,And he now goes around the country of Australia doing motivational talks and to score kids
00:26:36,00:26:37,and stuff.
00:26:37,00:26:42,"And his talks are basically, you never know, someone like, ""Cock up."""
00:26:42,00:26:47,He's always like the tenth person in the ass but the other nine get hit by others.
00:26:47,00:26:48,Yeah.
00:26:48,00:26:55,I was reading a bit about goalkeeping tactics over the years because this is about goalkeeper.
00:26:55,00:27:01,So John Burridge was a goalkeeper and he kept his reflexes nice and sharp between the 60s
00:27:01,00:27:09,and the 90s with his career by asking his wife to throw fruit at him when he wasn't looking.
00:27:09,00:27:15,"That was a guy called Harry Renny who was a Scottish goalie and in the 80s, 90s, his training"
00:27:15,00:27:20,"regime was to throw himself on the wooden boards for half an hour every day, just to toughen"
00:27:20,00:27:21,himself on.
00:27:21,00:27:23,"Yeah, because he'd have to be throwing himself on the floor."
00:27:23,00:27:24,"Exactly, yeah."
00:27:24,00:27:25,Yeah.
00:27:25,00:27:26,"Oh, okay."
00:27:26,00:27:27,That's for an hour.
00:27:27,00:27:31,So the first mention of football that I could find at least in Australia is a letter to
00:27:31,00:27:36,a newspaper complaining about football and it's a guy I'm going to read it out.
00:27:36,00:27:39,Our town is increasingly going in the wrong direction.
00:27:39,00:27:43,It will ultimately be no more than a Dutch Lang Street.
00:27:43,00:27:48,"My pipe is out, I must now halt, till you hear from me again, bog trotter."
00:27:48,00:27:49,Absolutely.
00:27:49,00:27:57,"And another thing about Norman Conquest is on, there's a website called HowManyOfMe.com where"
00:27:57,00:27:59,you can see how many names there are of you.
00:27:59,00:28:06,"This is only in America, unfortunately, but there are 288,278 Normans in America."
00:28:06,00:28:07,What?
00:28:07,00:28:08,Yeah.
00:28:08,00:28:09,What?
00:28:09,00:28:10,People called Norman.
00:28:10,00:28:11,How many?
00:28:11,00:28:12,"288,000."
00:28:12,00:28:14,"150 million men, roughly."
00:28:14,00:28:15,"Yeah, that's quite impressive."
00:28:15,00:28:16,That's massive.
00:28:16,00:28:21,There's 1882 people with the last name Conquest and there's one person in America called Norman
00:28:21,00:28:22,Conquest.
00:28:22,00:28:23,"Oh, really?"
00:28:23,00:28:24,Yeah.
00:28:24,00:28:25,"Oh, cool."
00:28:25,00:28:26,"So if you're listening, Norman."
00:28:26,00:28:29,"The name Norman is going out of fashion, I think, in Britain."
00:28:29,00:28:33,"I think in 2005, there were only two babies called Norman Bourne and then I couldn't even find"
00:28:33,00:28:39,"data for after that, so unless it's been a huge surge, then I think it might have disappeared"
00:28:39,00:28:40,entirely.
00:28:40,00:28:41,"No, it's really sad."
00:28:41,00:28:42,"Yeah, it's sad."
00:28:42,00:28:43,"Yeah, it's sad."
00:28:43,00:28:45,Can I quickly move the chat to names in Australia?
00:28:45,00:28:46,Yeah.
00:28:46,00:28:50,I've just started doing a Google on things that I both have been to in Australia just to see
00:28:50,00:28:51,the origins of it.
00:28:51,00:28:55,"And I was looking at Mount Cousie Cusco, which there's a lot of, I'm actually not sure how"
00:28:55,00:28:59,"to pronounce it properly, but it's the tallest mountain in Australia."
00:28:59,00:29:00,And I've climbed it.
00:29:00,00:29:01,It's so easy to climb.
00:29:01,00:29:03,It's a tiny little bump.
00:29:03,00:29:04,But we're very proud of it.
00:29:04,00:29:06,It's our tallest mountain.
00:29:06,00:29:10,"So there was a thing for years and years, it was called Mount Cousie Cusco, and it was"
00:29:10,00:29:17,"this wonderful mountain, and basically they discovered, and this was explained in a 1910 book that they"
00:29:17,00:29:21,eventually started recalculating the sizes and heights of mountains and discovered that
00:29:21,00:29:26,a mountain just near Mount Cousie Cusco called Mount Townsend was actually taller.
00:29:26,00:29:31,"So suddenly we had a new tallest mountain, and rather than changing all the books, they"
00:29:31,00:29:34,just decided this is going to be a massive hassle.
00:29:34,00:29:37,Let's just swap the names of the mountains.
00:29:37,00:29:39,They genuinely did that.
00:29:39,00:29:42,So Mount Cousie Cusco is actually Mount Townsend.
00:29:42,00:29:44,They were just too lazy to do any admin.
00:29:44,00:29:45,"That's such a good idea though, isn't it?"
00:29:45,00:29:46,Yeah.
00:29:46,00:29:47,You don't have to change any text for them.
00:29:47,00:29:51,"Yeah, all the mountains, you can just draw two arrows for these big mountains."
00:29:51,00:29:53,So does it not have many big mountains in Australia?
00:29:53,00:29:54,"No, not really."
00:29:54,00:29:55,I think it's bigger than ours.
00:29:55,00:29:56,How tall is Mount Cousie Cusco?
00:29:56,00:29:58,"It's 2,228 metres."
00:29:58,00:30:01,"Right, you know that's almost three times higher than England's highest mountain."
00:30:01,00:30:05,So where you go calling it a little bump?
00:30:05,00:30:06,Just be careful.
00:30:06,00:30:09,"It's not a tall, it's the biggest one in the mainland, isn't there?"
00:30:09,00:30:12,"There might be one in the Australian Islands, which is a bit..."
00:30:12,00:30:15,There are a bunch in the Australian Islands.
00:30:15,00:30:20,There's actually a bit on the Wikipedia page that says mountains higher than the highest mountain.
00:30:20,00:30:26,"There's a huge list, but not on the mainline, because there's a lot of mountains."
00:30:26,00:30:29,We just leave another one.
00:30:29,00:30:32,"We need to wrap up very soon, if you guys go anything before we do."
00:30:32,00:30:33,Some funny names?
00:30:33,00:30:34,Maybe.
00:30:34,00:30:36,"The background note to end on, exactly."
00:30:36,00:30:40,"There's a website called NameOfTheYear.com, which is quite cool."
00:30:40,00:30:44,"And there, I don't think it's an official award or anything like that, but they go around"
00:30:44,00:30:49,"and look in all the newspapers, and anyone who's kind of a notable person, and they take"
00:30:49,00:30:53,"all the funniest names, and they make them battle against each other, like which of these"
00:30:53,00:30:57,"is the best name, and they go through to the next round and you have a winner."
00:30:57,00:31:01,The winner last year was a lady who hit the news after being arrested for shot-lifting
00:31:01,00:31:06,"in Idaho, called Amanda Miranda Panda."
00:31:06,00:31:07,Wow.
00:31:07,00:31:12,We're sure she didn't just panic when the police are serving.
00:31:12,00:31:13,Yeah.
00:31:13,00:31:21,"Some of the people that she beat include Reverend Pierre Batista Pizza-Bola, who is the head"
00:31:21,00:31:28,"of the custody of the Holy Land Priory, and Dr. Wallop Promthong, who is a professor at"
00:31:28,00:31:31,Raja Mangala University.
00:31:31,00:31:34,"And there's people in Britain, various names."
00:31:34,00:31:37,"This was a newspaper article, I think it was in the Mirror or somewhere, people with funny"
00:31:37,00:31:38,names.
00:31:38,00:31:45,"There's a just in case, a barbed wire, a Terry Bull, and Doug Hall, all people in the UK with"
00:31:45,00:31:46,those names.
00:31:46,00:31:53,"And there's a retired erm, and called Stan Still, from Sirencester, and he said it's been"
00:31:53,00:31:57,"a blooming millstone around my neck, my entire life."
00:31:57,00:32:04,"Pretty way, I can't move."
00:32:04,00:32:06,"Okay, that's it."
