1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
 "You don't want it, who don't want it?"

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,600
 "You don't want it, who don't want it?"

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:15,080
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast.

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,120
 This week, coming to you live from Dave's Lester Comedy Festival.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,720
 My name is Dan Schreiber, and please welcome to the stage, it's Aniches Insky, James

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:34,640
 Harkin and Andy Murray.

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,000
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,800
 the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

9
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,800
 Starting with my fact, my fact this week is that when something thought to be a meteorite

10
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:54,680
 actually turns out to be an ordinary rock, it's called a meteor wrong.

11
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:00,720
 So we were sent that fact in by someone called Molly Christie, she listens to the show,

12
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,720
 she sent it in.

13
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:07,400
 I was looking into it, it's not obviously a official scientific terminology, but if you

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,200
 look into it, I've read AMAs on Reddit with meteorite experts, they all call it the

15
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,200
 meteorite.

16
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,200
 It is quite a common thing.

17
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,360
 I went to the Natural History Museum a few years ago, and there's a kind of a department

18
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,760
 there that if you have any weird stuff that you find in your garden or whatever, and you're

19
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,560
 not sure what it is, you can send it to them.

20
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,160
 They do call them meteorongs, and they think that actually when people think they find meteorites,

21
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,280
 it's almost always a meteorong, it's very rare that you actually do find a real one.

22
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,600
 So the Natural History Museum has a room of meteorongs which are basically just rocks.

23
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,600
 Yeah, pretty much.

24
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,600
 Pretty much.

25
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,600
 Yeah, they're gone.

26
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:46,240
 Yeah, there was a guy who was saying that, so he's at a University of Minnesota in America,

27
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,160
 he's called Calvin Alexander, his university professor, and he's been asking people for

28
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:55,360
 I think 30 years to come to him if they found a meteorite, they think they found a meteorite,

29
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:01,120
 and he says he's seen thousands, more than 5,000 meteorongs, he's retiring next year, never

30
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,960
 yet has someone brought him something that's turned out to be a meteorite.

31
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,600
 Until this year, a couple of them had a thing in their garden that they'd actually found

32
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,920
 a couple of years ago, and they said actually this looks a bit weird, brought it in.

33
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,920
 There you go.

34
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,920
 This is first ever meteorite.

35
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,920
 That's really cool.

36
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,920
 Oh, we should say what a meteorite is because I wasn't sure, so a meteorite is a chunk

37
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,120
 of rock flying through space, and then if it enters the Earth's atmosphere, it's a meteor,

38
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,520
 but then if a bit lands, then that becomes a meteorite, yeah, so it can be three different

39
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,240
 things, depending on where it is, yeah.

40
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,640
 And we get about 44 tons of meteorites falling on the planet every day, so you'd think there

41
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,640
 would be more.

42
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,680
 We do, there's a ridiculous number, I think it's 4 billion a year, loud or not, they're

43
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,400
 mostly, I think, really, really small, but it's a lot.

44
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,240
 Do you know how you can tell if you're out in the wild looking at rocks trying to find

45
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,120
 meteorites if it is one?

46
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,120
 No.

47
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,600
 So the magnetic, okay.

48
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,520
 Yeah, so if you have a little magnet with you, a little fridge magnet is something, if there's

49
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,760
 a magnetic pull against it, that doesn't, it still might, there are lots of it, it could

50
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,680
 be like a radiator or something, there's lots of things out there.

51
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,040
 So that's the thing, there are a lot of rocks that are just normal terrestrial rocks that

52
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,840
 are also magnetic, so don't just go around with them, you know, with a magnet trying to find

53
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,840
 one.

54
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,200
 That's what, so I got really excited when they said, yeah, if it's magnetic, then it's definitely

55
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,360
 a meteorite, except for the fact that a lot of rocks are magnetic, so it may just turn

56
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,360
 out to be a rock.

57
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,560
 However, if it's not magnetic, it could be a rock from Mars or from the Moon, which is

58
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,760
 even rarer, however, it could also just be a rock, so it doesn't sound like they've

59
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,440
 cracked the perfect method.

60
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,640
 I once wrote to a meteorite expert a few years ago and asked him what you should do if one

61
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,720
 land, because there's a common misconception that meteorites are hot when they land, but

62
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,760
 they're not, because they've just gone through space, which is really cold.

63
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,680
 And then they have gone through the atmosphere, so warmed up a bit, but they should have had

64
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,240
 plenty of time to cool down.

65
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:58,200
 So you could actually conceivably get a frostbite from touching a meteorite, like that, and

66
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,200
 hold on the inside.

67
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,440
 But when I wrote to this guy and said, what should you actually do?

68
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,000
 He said, whatever you do, don't touch it, you want to get a kind of a plastic bag and

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,480
 then put it down, because just you touching it could contaminate it, I mean, it's not very

70
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,480
 good for science.

71
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,320
 Don't touch those meteorites.

72
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:19,080
 I met an explorer over Skype called Charles Brewer Carias, amazing character, quite controversial

73
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,080
 character.

74
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:24,560
 The explorer and up was said to be based on him, you know, in the Pixar movie up, the guy

75
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,960
 living in the Venezuelan mountains said to be based on him.

76
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,960
 He's famous for a number of things and a lot of discoveries, including he told me that

77
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,120
 he discovered what he thinks is the lost city of gold, and he did it while he was having

78
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,160
 a poo in the woods, and he said to me, he said to me, I looked in between my legs and saw

79
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:50,520
 something spectacular, but he also told me that he's discovered this glowing coral, glowing

80
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:56,320
 coral, which is the oldest life form on this planet, and he said that he arrived via space

81
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,880
 meteorites, and so it's now living on Earth, an extraterrestrial.

82
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,600
 Is this how trustworthy is this guy, is he friends with your yeti hunting friends and your

83
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,600
 ghost seeking friends?

84
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,600
 I don't know.

85
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,120
 He said, he was like a biologist came in and said that this is definitely the oldest form

86
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,440
 of life, and actually it feels like it's from out of space, and then I emailed the biologist

87
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,000
 and she said there's about as much exo-biology in it as there is in my foot.

88
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,520
 So he must have heard it wrong kind of thing, but actually in the hills of all of Venezuela,

89
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:30,200
 she had an amazing foot, full of aliens.

90
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,560
 To not the Cambodian thing you shout when a meteorite arrives is star poo, is what you

91
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,560
 say.

92
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,600
 Archpecai, that's what happened when one landed in Cambodia in 2014.

93
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,840
 Is that what they call them?

94
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,840
 Well loads of people shouted, the local, commercial people shouted star poo, so that's an official

95
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,840
 scientific name.

96
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,840
 Right here on.

97
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,840
 Yeah.

98
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,840
 Wow.

99
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,320
 There was a, the R&I launched a really big search and rescue operation last year, I

100
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,080
 think, because of a meteor flying through the sky, and they thought it was a distress

101
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,400
 flurbing sent up by a ship.

102
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,960
 There was an emergency operation, this was off the Cambrian coast, I think.

103
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,840
 And I think, you know, it takes quite a lot of money, and they went out there and then gradually

104
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,560
 reports that are coming through from the rest of the country saying there's this flur

105
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,800
 going across the sky everywhere, and it turned out, yep, no one's dying.

106
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,000
 Which is actually good news in way.

107
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,440
 In the late 18th century in France, they didn't think that the Academy of France said they

108
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,160
 didn't think that meteorites could possibly exist.

109
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:32,040
 Supposedly what they said was, there are no rocks in the sky, therefore rocks cannot fall

110
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,040
 from the sky.

111
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,040
 And they decided.

112
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,040
 The logic is actually infallible.

113
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:40,040
 Yeah, it's true, but that's apparently what they said, and apparently they, it meant

114
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,400
 that they didn't do any kind of studies on possible meteorites, because if someone said

115
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,720
 they found one and saw one land, they were like, well, duh, obviously not real.

116
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:55,800
 But then in 1803, more than 2,000 meteorites fell in a single village in Normandy, and so

117
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,360
 they had to kind of change their mind a little.

118
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,360
 Wow.

119
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,400
 Yeah, apparently that's a story, I don't know if it's true.

120
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,400
 It's very cool.

121
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,400
 Yeah.

122
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:09,080
 There was a meteorite fell through the roof of a house owned by the Comet family recently.

123
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,520
 I think it was two years ago.

124
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,760
 That was nice, isn't it?

125
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,560
 Comet, I think they're French.

126
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,080
 You didn't read anything more on that story than the effects.

127
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,080
 No, why would I?

128
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,520
 It's only going to get worse from there.

129
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,560
 So we need to move on quite soon to our next fact.

130
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,080
 Okay, can I do just a quick thing, a new story that I read.

131
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,760
 A Bosnian man had his house hit five times by meteorites in less than six months a few

132
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,760
 years ago.

133
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,320
 Experts at the local university were like, well, maybe there's like a magnetic anomaly

134
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,800
 or something like that.

135
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:47,800
 But he thought that he said, I'm obviously being targeted by extraterrestrials.

136
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,680
 I don't know what I've done to annoy them, but there is no other explanation that makes sense.

137
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,800
 The chance of being hit by a meteorite is so small that getting hit five times has to

138
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,080
 be deliberate.

139
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:07,000
 Okay, let's move on to our second fact of the show and that is Andy Murray.

140
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,720
 My fact this week is that Brown Falkans commit arson.

141
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,880
 So these Australian birds are kind of Falkan and there are two species.

142
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:21,480
 Brown Falkans and black kites and they've been observed picking up when they're wildfires.

143
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,560
 They've been observed picking up smoldering bits of branch and twig and carrying them to

144
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,440
 new locations and starting fires in new areas, which then makes all the little creatures

145
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,920
 in the undergrowth run out so that they can kill them and eat them.

146
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:38,520
 So this is deliberate fire starting as a way of getting food.

147
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:43,880
 And it's all so far, it's not been observed, it's not been filmed and it's anecdotal evidence

148
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,920
 from park rangers, Aboriginal Australians and Australian firemen.

149
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,120
 So it could be made up, couldn't it?

150
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,080
 I don't think it's made up, but I think it needs to be observed properly.

151
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,800
 It seems likely though, it doesn't make sense because they rely on fires for their food

152
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,800
 very often, don't they?

153
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,800
 Those types of birds.

154
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,800
 It makes sense.

155
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,120
 It reminds me of a thing we did a radio show with a guy called Rupert Sheldrake a

156
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:11,480
 few years ago and he said that people anecdotally have said that when sheep want to get across

157
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,560
 a cattle grid, they kind of roll over on the cattle grid to get from one side to the other.

158
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,040
 And he said, "Nodes of people have seen this happening, but actually we think probably

159
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,040
 it never happened.

160
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,800
 It might be just a story."

161
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,280
 What they noticed was someone started reporting it in one bit of Australia and then a few

162
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:31,480
 days later, sheep across the country started doing it as if there was some kind of secret

163
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,280
 sheep whispering network that managed to spread.

164
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,280
 But it's, yeah, so it sounds like it's in the Sheldrake area slightly, I guess.

165
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:43,880
 But actually, these people who have been talking about it are, like you say, the park rangers

166
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,800
 and people who kind of would know that kind of thing.

167
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,280
 Yeah, so it would be very, very good to know if it does happen, so there's more research

168
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,800
 being done, basically, and more observation being done.

169
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,800
 The one of the co-authors of it, Mark Bonta, has suggested that humans might have learnt

170
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:05,600
 about spreading fires from birds, which seems less likely.

171
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,880
 Yeah, because they have to carry them quite small distances while they're still smoldering,

172
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,200
 obviously, because if you fly far, then it'll go out.

173
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:20,120
 If we learn about carrying fire from birds, we overtook them so fast, but still that occasionally

174
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:25,360
 picking up a burning ember, we've got one by a night.

175
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,360
 Does that happen, though?

176
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,120
 So in 2014, Pigeon in Stockwell did start a fire by dropping a cigarette in its nest,

177
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,120
 so.

178
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,120
 Oh, I did it.

179
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,880
 Well, we don't know.

180
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,640
 I've read about this new Kickstarter that's been fully funded where you can now, if you're

181
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,880
 out in the camping or whatever, it's this little kit where you light a fire and it heats

182
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,400
 up this pad that creates a battery charge for your iPhone.

183
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,800
 So you've got an external iPhone charger now, or smartphone charger, which plugs in

184
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,680
 to a fire source to give you what it's.

185
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,960
 Yeah, it's not really cool.

186
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,960
 That is smart.

187
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,960
 It's very cool.

188
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,960
 Yeah.

189
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:05,800
 I mean, fire, actually some humans still can't make fire, or until the 20th century, there

190
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,280
 are tribes that had still hadn't learned how to make fire.

191
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:15,200
 So there are the, for instance, FA and Booty pigmies that I think pigmy tribes that are in

192
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,040
 the Democratic Republic of the Congo, they, we think they could make fire thousands of years

193
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,040
 ago.

194
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,040
 There's some evidence for that.

195
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,040
 But it seems like they've forgotten.

196
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,920
 Now, it's part of tribal tradition that you have to carry around a burning ember with

197
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,920
 you all the time.

198
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:33,160
 So you get fire from, like if there's a lightning storm in the forest, then a tree sets on fire,

199
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,480
 and you pick up that.

200
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,840
 And it's the women's job in these tribes to carry around this burning ember, and they have

201
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:42,320
 to wrap it up, you know, dump leaves when they move from one campsite to the next so that

202
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,320
 they keep this fire.

203
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,960
 Because if the fire goes out, it's like, we've got no fire.

204
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,960
 Just waiting for the next storm.

205
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,960
 Waiting for the next storm, yeah.

206
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,960
 Isn't that weird?

207
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,960
 Yeah.

208
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,960
 Yeah.

209
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:55,000
 And then I think some anthropologists turned off about 20 years ago and said, guys.

210
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,560
 I was reading about some other unusual birds, cool birds.

211
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,560
 Oh, yeah.

212
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:05,120
 And so, baby grey cat birds, they get their name because they make her noise like a cat.

213
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,480
 They kind of do a little meow, which sounds great, but it's not really great for them because

214
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,960
 it just attracts cats.

215
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,960
 [LAUGHTER]

216
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,960
 That is it.

217
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,800
 I must say, the evolutionary of the time.

218
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,800
 Exactly.

219
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:22,520
 And in 2011, they did a study, and they found that domestic cats were responsible for nearly

220
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,680
 half of all deaths of these birds.

221
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,680
 Oh, my God.

222
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,680
 Oh, my God.

223
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,680
 Here's another one.

224
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,600
 There's a hummingbird called Anna's hummingbird.

225
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,600
 Oh, yeah.

226
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,600
 Yeah, so I'm not.

227
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,600
 Yeah.

228
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,600
 Didn't want to come tonight.

229
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:40,000
 Anna's hummingbird can shake their bodies 55 times per second, which is the fastest shake

230
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,200
 of any vertebrae known.

231
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:47,280
 Just back to the sounds, I was reading about a bird that's called the Fortail Drongo.

232
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:52,120
 And this bird has the ability to mimic other animals and other birds.

233
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,240
 And what it does is it lets out, it's learned the call of those danger nearby.

234
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,680
 So if it feels like, it's so basically, it's so that they can steal food off other animals.

235
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:06,280
 So they'll be like, "Danger's coming," and then they'll say it like a cat or like a hamster

236
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,280
 or something.

237
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,280
 Oh, like a human.

238
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,280
 Could they say danger's coming?

239
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,280
 I think they've mastered human.

240
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,280
 I think they've mastered human.

241
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,280
 Yeah.

242
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,920
 And so these things run off, and then they get the food.

243
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:19,440
 But they've learned to both lie and not lie when there is actual danger.

244
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,320
 So they've kept animals on their toes when they hear it and go, "Oh, it's probably that

245
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,320
 dickhead bird."

246
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,320
 They can actually then get eaten because it wasn't telling us that.

247
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,320
 It's cry wolf.

248
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,320
 Yes.

249
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,320
 But sometimes there is a wolf.

250
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,320
 Yeah.

251
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,720
 You obviously never read to the end of the story of cry wolf.

252
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,200
 I got the gist of it.

253
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,200
 The same thing.

254
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,200
 You just get happy.

255
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
 Oh my, this is boring.

256
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,200
 Oh my god.

257
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,200
 Oh my god.

258
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,200
 Cookies.

259
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,920
 So I was looking at a bird's committing crimes.

260
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:51,960
 These birds commit arson, cookies are obviously very famous criminal birds, you know, put their

261
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:56,000
 eggs in other birds' nest and disguise them as other birds' eggs, and then the egg hatches

262
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,480
 and it tips all the real eggs out of the nest.

263
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,480
 And that's that.

264
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:04,120
 So they're murderers and kind of house thieves, but other birds are getting really wise

265
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,120
 to it.

266
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,000
 So they've cookies have evolved to make their eggs mimic the eggs of whatever bird who's

267
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 nest they want to steal.

268
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,440
 So the eggs look identical to our human eyes to the bird who's nest they want to steal

269
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:22,680
 eggs, but birds, other birds have now developed evolved really super sensitive infrared type

270
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,680
 vision.

271
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,720
 So they can see really subtle differences in cookies eggs that completely distinguish them

272
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,720
 from their own eggs.

273
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,680
 So they're getting the better of them gradually.

274
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,680
 That's very cool.

275
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,560
 But then the cookies will probably evolve again to beat that and it's actually.

276
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,560
 It's a race.

277
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,560
 Yeah.

278
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,720
 Well, I can't be evolved to build their own nests one day, you know.

279
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:47,560
 Actually, I think of all the cuckoo species, I think most of them don't do that parasitic thing.

280
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,400
 The ones in Europe do, but around the world, I think most of them don't.

281
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,720
 Yeah, that's true.

282
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,560
 And last month in Israeli culture was arrested, it lebanon for spying.

283
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,560
 So.

284
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,560
 Happily?

285
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,560
 No.

286
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,560
 And is it, was it charged?

287
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,560
 It.

288
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,560
 No, I don't think so.

289
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,560
 I think it was eventually released.

290
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,560
 So what kind of interrogation happened that they were?

291
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,560
 No, you didn't do it, did you?

292
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,560
 You've been framed.

293
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:15,000
 It had a location transmitter and an Israeli identification tag on it.

294
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,080
 So I suppose the thinking was that Israeli spies would have written "This is a spy" on

295
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,080
 a bird.

296
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,080
 Yeah.

297
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:29,680
 In 1471, a chicken in Basel was found guilty of laying a brightly coloured egg, which

298
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,080
 was thought to be indefiance of natural law.

299
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,080
 What was the penalty?

300
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,880
 Unfortunately, it wasn't let free like the Israeli one.

301
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,560
 It was burned to death at the stake.

302
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,560
 Oh.

303
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,560
 It was just a vicious stake.

304
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,360
 And so Nandos was born.

305
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,960
 I found a bird that I'd never heard of before.

306
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,960
 It's a Tibetan black bird.

307
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,960
 This is its name.

308
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,960
 Turdus Maximus.

309
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,960
 It's an actual bird.

310
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,960
 All COVID birds are the turdus genus, aren't they?

311
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,960
 I don't know.

312
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,960
 Is that genus?

313
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,960
 Russian are all turdus.

314
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,960
 So they're turdus, I think?

315
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,960
 They're turdus turdus.

316
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,240
 So COVID is a crow's and--

317
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,080
 COVID is the best.

318
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:12,400
 The crow's ravens, magpies, all birds like that, and they're so intelligent.

319
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:17,240
 So this fact is kind of about birds are preyed learning how to use tools in a way.

320
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,440
 And COVID is amazing at using tools.

321
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:26,200
 So there was one experiment where a crow was-- it was given a piece of wire, and it managed

322
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:31,080
 to bend this piece of wire into a hook using a glass kind of beaker that was nearby.

323
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,800
 So it pushed the glass beaker against a wall so that it bent this bit of wire into

324
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,800
 a hook.

325
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,760
 It ordered it could hook a stick that was slightly out of its reach, and it hooked the stick

326
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,760
 towards it.

327
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,840
 And then it took the long stick with which it was able to get the food that it wanted to

328
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,840
 get.

329
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,840
 That's impressive, isn't it?

330
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,840
 That's really impressive.

331
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:52,480
 I don't know why I couldn't just fly over and pick up the food, but it was challenging itself.

332
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,000
 We're going to have to move on really shortly.

333
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,520
 So anything else before we do?

334
00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:02,280
 Koalas to escape forest fires, their instinctive reaction is to crawl up a tree, so they often

335
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,360
 have to get rescued by Australian fire fighters.

336
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,360
 They're badly evolved.

337
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,360
 Yeah.

338
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,700
 But they presumably move really slowly, so that's their best bet I'm guessing.

339
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:16,520
 I would never picture like a herd of koalas coming out, because the fighter was approaching

340
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,520
 them.

341
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,520
 Yeah.

342
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,360
 All right, let's move on to our third fact of the evening, and that is Chisinski.

343
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:29,880
 Yeah, my fact is that in 1461, the mayor of Haien in Spain donated 10,000 eggs to his

344
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,920
 citizens, so they can have a huge food fight.

345
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,920
 It's nice of him.

346
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,920
 He's a good guy.

347
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:41,640
 This is a guy called Constable Don Miguel Lucas de Aranzo, and he decided for Easter, Easter

348
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:47,040
 celebration, give his people this big food fight, and he built this huge fake wooden castle

349
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:51,120
 that he wheeled into the city centre, and I think he then hold himself up in his house

350
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,120
 with some of his guards, and he was like to the townspeople, said, you get in this castle,

351
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,440
 and let's pelt each other with eggs for a while, and they did it.

352
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,280
 And then they did it again on Mayday, because they enjoyed it so much, and for a few stops

353
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,280
 for a few years.

354
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,040
 It does kind of feel like a thing that should have carried on forever, doesn't it?

355
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,040
 Yes.

356
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,040
 Because it does sound like the most fun thing ever.

357
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,040
 Yeah.

358
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,040
 One must have happened to stop it.

359
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:14,000
 I feel like he, because it always seems to be him throughout the 1460s, so maybe when

360
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,720
 he left office, he sounds like maybe the Boris Johnson of the 15th century, he probably

361
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,520
 has some dodgy policies, but did a lot of fun stuff on the side, but won the people

362
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,520
 round.

363
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,400
 I read that in one of the other fights that he had, that there was such a surplus of

364
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,640
 food that people then started hitting each other with chickens.

365
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,640
 No.

366
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,640
 No.

367
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,640
 Yeah.

368
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,640
 Why don't you hit someone with a chicken?

369
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,680
 It's just an older rag, isn't it?

370
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,680
 Oh.

371
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,360
 Waiter, I think this egg is off.

372
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,600
 Sir, you come into Dando's every day and say that.

373
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,320
 There were boiled eggs, I think, which sounds a bit less fun.

374
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,320
 Oh, right.

375
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,320
 Yeah.

376
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,320
 I've read mixed.

377
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,320
 There's a lot of controversy over the type of egg.

378
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,320
 Oh, really?

379
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,160
 Some also say boiled, some say just raw, but it's so hard to tell from the outside, isn't

380
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,160
 it?

381
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,160
 Yeah.

382
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:07,560
 Actually, there is a game called Egg Roulette, which, so I think this is part of the Lincoln

383
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,080
 Share World Egg Throwing Championships, which are a massive deal.

384
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,840
 We've probably all tried to get tickets at some point.

385
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:17,680
 And they have stuff like the World Egg Trebuchet and Egg Throwing, obviously.

386
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:22,120
 And then one of the contests is Egg Roulette, which involves you sit at a table with one

387
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,240
 of the person and you've got a whole bunch of eggs laid out in front of you, and they're

388
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,640
 all boiled except one, and you take it in turns to select one and smash it against your

389
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,640
 forehead.

390
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,040
 And then you get covered in raw egg when you pick the wrong one.

391
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,080
 It's not as dangerous as Russian roulette, but...

392
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:39,800
 But you're still covered in, but you're still covered in sort of boiled egg when it's

393
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,800
 not great.

394
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,800
 It's not a good result.

395
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,800
 It's not ideal.

396
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,440
 And the egg throw in itself, it's quite good.

397
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,640
 It's what happens is your ten meters away from your friend, you chuck him the egg or

398
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,000
 she, and they have to catch it and not break it.

399
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,480
 And then everyone does that, and everyone who does it right and it doesn't break, then they

400
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,000
 go to 20 meters and then 30 meters and then 40 meters.

401
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,720
 So it's quite a cool game though, isn't it?

402
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,120
 I reckon you should have a little later on.

403
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,080
 Well, that rules that you have to throw it fairly towards them, because you could throw

404
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,240
 it off a bit, and then they find a very difficult...

405
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,440
 You're in a team, so you actually...

406
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,440
 Yeah, you're watching the catch it.

407
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,440
 You want to see.

408
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,440
 That's why your team keeps losing.

409
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,440
 I'm going to get that guy this time.

410
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,600
 Are you allowed to use an apron to catch it?

411
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,160
 The apron, I think, with your hands, it has to be.

412
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,960
 And they also have very strict drug rules as well, according to the website.

413
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,840
 No, they say that, like any sport, you're not allowed any performance in enhancing drugs,

414
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:38,960
 but they do say that the local happyjack real ale is not only permitted, but recommended.

415
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:47,240
 I was reading about being egged, the phenomenon of being egged, being egged.

416
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,960
 It's a fun thing to say.

417
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:54,720
 There was a 2006 study, which was called, "Here's egg in your eye, a prospective study of

418
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,600
 blunt oculotroma resulting from thrown eggs."

419
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,280
 This was a real study, and it just concluded, "Don't do it."

420
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,160
 I mean, how have people been oculotly traumatised frequently?

421
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,160
 Yes, really.

422
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,160
 Not frequently, no.

423
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,160
 But it does happen.

424
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,160
 Very seldom.

425
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:19,240
 This is Janu Kovic, the president of the Ukraine, got struck with a brick, was rushed to hospital

426
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,840
 because he'd been struck with a brick, and it transpired when people looked.

427
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,720
 But I think they look back over the footage, and it has just been an egg.

428
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,120
 So it is apparently more dangerous and hard hitting than they look.

429
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,120
 Yeah.

430
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,120
 Wow.

431
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,120
 So he didn't look at the debris around him.

432
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,880
 He just assumed it was a brick.

433
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:38,560
 I think, I guess, maybe he has serious oculotomage and could no longer see who's surrounding.

434
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,560
 I don't agree.

435
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,560
 You don't get egged.

436
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,560
 You get yogoted.

437
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,560
 It's called the Ayur-Turma.

438
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,560
 Don't write in.

439
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:49,680
 Yeah, like yogate, the Ayur-Turma.

440
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:53,240
 And it's a specific kind of yogate that they use, which is sheep's milk yogate.

441
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:58,480
 That's really good for Ayur-Turma-ing people because you're sort of reminding people that

442
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,080
 the Greek and that they've shamed Greekness by trying Greek yoghurt.

443
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:07,440
 So when you say the special kind, do you go into a shop, say, "Do you have any yoghurt?"

444
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:15,160
 And they say, "Is this for eating or for assaulting in politicians?"

445
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,360
 They're in the top left corner, yeah.

446
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:22,120
 Oh, there was quite a vicious food fight in 1818 in Harvard, apparently.

447
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:26,520
 This was an era of quite a lot of student protests in America, I think.

448
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:31,280
 And yeah, this food fight started when someone threw a slice of buttered bread and it ended

449
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,280
 up going mad for days.

450
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:36,400
 And like, all the crocker, all harbours crockery was smashed, lots of plates and chairs were

451
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,360
 thrown at each other, lots of furniture broken.

452
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,080
 There was, a lot of students were suspended unsurprisingly and then all the other students

453
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,160
 who hadn't been suspended went and protested.

454
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,160
 One of them was Emerson.

455
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,920
 Ralph Aldoemerson was there at the time and he protested and went stood under a tree and

456
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:54,640
 they sort of mobbed all the tutors and said, "How dare you suspend students for breaking

457
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,360
 all the furniture in this place, smashing all the crockery."

458
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,680
 And yet apparently this is quite a common occurrence.

459
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,480
 So they let them all back in because they were upset.

460
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,480
 Wow.

461
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,800
 Hey, let's move on to our final fact of the show and that is James Harkin.

462
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:15,120
 Okay, my fact this week is that in 1951, Australia's football team played against England and lost

463
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,960
 17 nil.

464
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,440
 The goalkeeper was called Norman Conquest.

465
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:28,280
 What a great name, Norman Conquest, I love it and he's quite a famous goalkeeper he's

466
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:32,600
 in the Australian Hall of Fame but he's most famous for being in this one game where they

467
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,760
 got absolutely annihilated by England.

468
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,880
 Well 17 nil, but how did he...

469
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,880
 There was a report written by a guy called Tugger Bryant.

470
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:46,280
 It was another form of footballer and he said that Australia could not handle the mud.

471
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,400
 It was a really, really muddy pitch.

472
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,400
 Australia could not handle the mud whereas England reveled in it and rang rings around

473
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,240
 the Australians.

474
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,520
 Our players spent more time on their backs in the mud than on their feet.

475
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,280
 The only time they were on their feet was when the band played God save the Queen.

476
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:09,280
 So yeah, the English team could kind of deal with their heavy conditions but the Australians

477
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,880
 just weren't used to it.

478
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,920
 I looked up more excellent football than names from history.

479
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,920
 Oh yeah, of course.

480
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:22,520
 So Reading in the 17s had a goalkeeper called Steve Death and just outside the goalie arena,

481
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,680
 there's Zimbabwean defender, I'm sure you'll have heard of him, James, called Danger

482
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:33,920
 Forpence. It's gun-end chap called Naughty Naughty.

483
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,920
 Amazing.

484
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:38,440
 That's a brilliant striker called Creedence Clearwater Cuto because his parents were such

485
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,120
 fans of Creedence Clearwater Revival.

486
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,280
 Yeah, he's my feminist, he's called everyone calls him Paul Easter, I think.

487
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,280
 Do they?

488
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,280
 Yeah.

489
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,280
 Australia, now obviously quite a decent team, aren't they?

490
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,280
 It's such a good team.

491
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:53,760
 Because that's from Australia or was brought up in Australia, weren't you?

492
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,080
 So here, you're a fan of the soccer rules, and we watched the games in the last World Cup

493
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,400
 in the QI office.

494
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:03,920
 When they lost 17 nil, it was a record defeat, I think, of any team in an international game.

495
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:11,280
 But now Australia holds the record win when they beat American Samoa 31 nil in 2001.

496
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:16,600
 But what happened there was the American Samoa team all had passport issues and so all but

497
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:20,240
 one of the players were ineligible to play because they couldn't get out of the cage

498
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,760
 and they couldn't call up any of their under 20 team because they were all doing exams at

499
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:31,960
 the time and so they had to just draft in all these really, really young or inexperienced

500
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:37,680
 players, including three, fifteen year olds and at the end of the game, the stadium showed

501
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:43,680
 that the score was 32 nil because everyone had lost count of them because of that record.

502
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,680
 There's always a little caveat for any international glory for Australian sports.

503
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,680
 It's so annoying.

504
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,200
 Do you remember the Olympics?

505
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:55,080
 It was that speed racer guy on, so he was a speed skater, right?

506
00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:01,160
 Yeah, speed skater and he was coming last in the heats and, or I think it was, he'd made

507
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,800
 it through the heats and he was in the semis and as they came round the corner on the last

508
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,520
 bit, he was way in behind, someone tripped in front, took out everyone.

509
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:13,600
 He was so far back that he could dodge right around, came first, made it to the finals.

510
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,840
 So everyone was going, there was no way this guy should ever be here, but here he is now.

511
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:23,520
 The finals gets round to the same corner, he's way behind, same thing happens, he took over

512
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:30,320
 it and just walked in to gold, first up to gold that we've got and he got it because both

513
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,320
 tied.

514
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:36,880
 And he now goes around the country of Australia doing motivational talks and to score kids

515
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,880
 and stuff.

516
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:42,320
 And his talks are basically, you never know, someone like, "Cock up."

517
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,800
 He's always like the tenth person in the ass but the other nine get hit by others.

518
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,800
 Yeah.

519
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:55,520
 I was reading a bit about goalkeeping tactics over the years because this is about goalkeeper.

520
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:01,520
 So John Burridge was a goalkeeper and he kept his reflexes nice and sharp between the 60s

521
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:09,000
 and the 90s with his career by asking his wife to throw fruit at him when he wasn't looking.

522
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,720
 That was a guy called Harry Renny who was a Scottish goalie and in the 80s, 90s, his training

523
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:20,800
 regime was to throw himself on the wooden boards for half an hour every day, just to toughen

524
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,800
 himself on.

525
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,560
 Yeah, because he'd have to be throwing himself on the floor.

526
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,560
 Exactly, yeah.

527
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,560
 Yeah.

528
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,560
 Oh, okay.

529
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,560
 That's for an hour.

530
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:31,680
 So the first mention of football that I could find at least in Australia is a letter to

531
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:36,520
 a newspaper complaining about football and it's a guy I'm going to read it out.

532
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,640
 Our town is increasingly going in the wrong direction.

533
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:43,240
 It will ultimately be no more than a Dutch Lang Street.

534
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:48,440
 My pipe is out, I must now halt, till you hear from me again, bog trotter.

535
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,440
 Absolutely.

536
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:57,080
 And another thing about Norman Conquest is on, there's a website called HowManyOfMe.com where

537
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,640
 you can see how many names there are of you.

538
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:06,720
 This is only in America, unfortunately, but there are 288,278 Normans in America.

539
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,720
 What?

540
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,720
 Yeah.

541
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,720
 What?

542
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,720
 People called Norman.

543
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,720
 How many?

544
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,720
 288,000.

545
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,240
 150 million men, roughly.

546
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,240
 Yeah, that's quite impressive.

547
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,240
 That's massive.

548
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:21,680
 There's 1882 people with the last name Conquest and there's one person in America called Norman

549
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,680
 Conquest.

550
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,680
 Oh, really?

551
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,680
 Yeah.

552
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,680
 Oh, cool.

553
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,680
 So if you're listening, Norman.

554
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,000
 The name Norman is going out of fashion, I think, in Britain.

555
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,680
 I think in 2005, there were only two babies called Norman Bourne and then I couldn't even find

556
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:39,120
 data for after that, so unless it's been a huge surge, then I think it might have disappeared

557
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,120
 entirely.

558
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,120
 No, it's really sad.

559
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,120
 Yeah, it's sad.

560
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,120
 Yeah, it's sad.

561
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,600
 Can I quickly move the chat to names in Australia?

562
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,600
 Yeah.

563
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,800
 I've just started doing a Google on things that I both have been to in Australia just to see

564
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,800
 the origins of it.

565
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,600
 And I was looking at Mount Cousie Cusco, which there's a lot of, I'm actually not sure how

566
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,080
 to pronounce it properly, but it's the tallest mountain in Australia.

567
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,080
 And I've climbed it.

568
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,080
 It's so easy to climb.

569
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,040
 It's a tiny little bump.

570
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,880
 But we're very proud of it.

571
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,360
 It's our tallest mountain.

572
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:10,720
 So there was a thing for years and years, it was called Mount Cousie Cusco, and it was

573
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:17,160
 this wonderful mountain, and basically they discovered, and this was explained in a 1910 book that they

574
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:21,880
 eventually started recalculating the sizes and heights of mountains and discovered that

575
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:26,560
 a mountain just near Mount Cousie Cusco called Mount Townsend was actually taller.

576
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:31,520
 So suddenly we had a new tallest mountain, and rather than changing all the books, they

577
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,320
 just decided this is going to be a massive hassle.

578
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,200
 Let's just swap the names of the mountains.

579
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,800
 They genuinely did that.

580
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,480
 So Mount Cousie Cusco is actually Mount Townsend.

581
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,120
 They were just too lazy to do any admin.

582
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,880
 That's such a good idea though, isn't it?

583
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,880
 Yeah.

584
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,880
 You don't have to change any text for them.

585
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:51,960
 Yeah, all the mountains, you can just draw two arrows for these big mountains.

586
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,920
 So does it not have many big mountains in Australia?

587
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,920
 No, not really.

588
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,920
 I think it's bigger than ours.

589
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,920
 How tall is Mount Cousie Cusco?

590
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,160
 It's 2,228 metres.

591
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,840
 Right, you know that's almost three times higher than England's highest mountain.

592
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,160
 So where you go calling it a little bump?

593
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,160
 Just be careful.

594
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,440
 It's not a tall, it's the biggest one in the mainland, isn't there?

595
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,160
 There might be one in the Australian Islands, which is a bit...

596
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,720
 There are a bunch in the Australian Islands.

597
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:20,080
 There's actually a bit on the Wikipedia page that says mountains higher than the highest mountain.

598
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:26,200
 There's a huge list, but not on the mainline, because there's a lot of mountains.

599
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,280
 We just leave another one.

600
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,440
 We need to wrap up very soon, if you guys go anything before we do.

601
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,440
 Some funny names?

602
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,440
 Maybe.

603
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,880
 The background note to end on, exactly.

604
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,680
 There's a website called NameOfTheYear.com, which is quite cool.

605
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:44,120
 And there, I don't think it's an official award or anything like that, but they go around

606
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:49,120
 and look in all the newspapers, and anyone who's kind of a notable person, and they take

607
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,280
 all the funniest names, and they make them battle against each other, like which of these

608
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:57,040
 is the best name, and they go through to the next round and you have a winner.

609
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:01,360
 The winner last year was a lady who hit the news after being arrested for shot-lifting

610
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:06,360
 in Idaho, called Amanda Miranda Panda.

611
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,360
 Wow.

612
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:12,360
 We're sure she didn't just panic when the police are serving.

613
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,360
 Yeah.

614
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:21,520
 Some of the people that she beat include Reverend Pierre Batista Pizza-Bola, who is the head

615
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:28,480
 of the custody of the Holy Land Priory, and Dr. Wallop Promthong, who is a professor at

616
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,880
 Raja Mangala University.

617
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,480
 And there's people in Britain, various names.

618
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,560
 This was a newspaper article, I think it was in the Mirror or somewhere, people with funny

619
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,560
 names.

620
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:45,560
 There's a just in case, a barbed wire, a Terry Bull, and Doug Hall, all people in the UK with

621
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,560
 those names.

622
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:53,400
 And there's a retired erm, and called Stan Still, from Sirencester, and he said it's been

623
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:57,040
 a blooming millstone around my neck, my entire life.

624
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:04,040
 Pretty way, I can't move.

625
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,040
 Okay, that's it.

626
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,040
 That's all of our facts.
