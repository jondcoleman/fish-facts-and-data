1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
 (ding, ding, ding, ding)

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,640
 (speaking in foreign language)

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,640
 (ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding)

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:13,640
 Hello and welcome to another episode

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,600
 of no such thing as a fish,

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,720
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,480
 from Brisbane!

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,480
 (audience cheering)

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,960
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,440
 with Annachos Insky, Andrew Hunter Murray,

11
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,600
 and James Harkin.

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,200
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

13
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,240
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,480
 And in a particular order, here we go.

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,760
 Starting with you, Andy.

16
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,680
 My fact is that during prohibition in America,

17
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,800
 the cops responsible for busting speakeasies did so,

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,160
 dressed as grave diggers, farmers, statues,

19
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,200
 opga goers, cowboys, judges,

20
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,800
 bums, and old Italian matrons.

21
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,240
 (audience laughing)

22
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,240
 What was the penultimate one there?

23
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,240
 Bums.

24
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,240
 Yeah, yeah.

25
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,240
 Like homeless people.

26
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,240
 Like homeless people.

27
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,240
 Exactly, yeah.

28
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,240
 What was the statues?

29
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,280
 There weren't just as bottoms on the way

30
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,840
 to a fancy dress party.

31
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,400
 (laughing)

32
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,400
 Although they probably could have done,

33
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,400
 they were incredible.

34
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,320
 They had, there were two agents and they had this massive,

35
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,600
 they were the best prohibition enforcing agents.

36
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,000
 So prohibition, 1919 to 1933, alcohol,

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,920
 sales were banned across America.

38
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,040
 And there were these guys called Isadot Einstein and Mo Smith.

39
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,880
 And they arrested 4,900 people in--

40
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,720
 Wow.

41
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,560
 Yeah, I know.

42
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,880
 And the conviction rate was 95%.

43
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,160
 They were incredible.

44
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,920
 But they were mainly famous for their disguises.

45
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,200
 So they had a dressing up box.

46
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,000
 They dressed as tram conductors, or opera singers sometimes.

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,560
 They went to the Democratic National Convention,

48
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,960
 disguised as politicians.

49
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,840
 But where would they, so like, if they were opera singers,

50
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,720
 were they just going to bars and just being like,

51
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,440
 "Hello."

52
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,640
 What does an opera singer look like, I guess, as a question?

53
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,320
 Yeah.

54
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,440
 Sometimes they would, there were some bars

55
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,920
 which were next to opera houses, I think.

56
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,000
 But they, yeah, go on.

57
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,640
 They like to go for all the different countries as well,

58
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,480
 didn't they?

59
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,520
 All the different nationalities.

60
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,000
 So apparently they dressed as a German pickle packer,

61
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,200
 a pol, I mean, that's just nice to say, isn't it?

62
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,120
 (laughing)

63
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,160
 A Polish count, a Hungarian violinist,

64
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,880
 a Yiddish gravedigger, a French matredi,

65
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,280
 an Italian fruit vendor, and a Russian fisherman.

66
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,600
 They were incredible.

67
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,600
 Supposedly, Einstein and Smith, both dudes,

68
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,880
 once posed as husband and wife,

69
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,120
 which is a much easier costume for one of them

70
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,400
 than it is for the other one.

71
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,920
 'Cause these were two big guys.

72
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,000
 And they said that no one would,

73
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,200
 no one suspected them of being prohibition agents

74
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,720
 because they just looked unlikely.

75
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,960
 So the pickle thing.

76
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,680
 And everyone was so pissed, they didn't notice.

77
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,360
 Sometimes they would go up to a bar

78
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,160
 and they'd say, "I'm a prohibition agent.

79
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,160
 "Let me in."

80
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,160
 And they would say, "Yeah, very funny.

81
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,000
 "In you go."

82
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,280
 And then they'd go in and arrest everybody.

83
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,920
 Wow, that's like jediism.

84
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,120
 So that happened once to it.

85
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,680
 He had the prohibition badge on his coat.

86
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,920
 And he said to him, "Would you sell a pint of whiskey

87
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,320
 "to a deserving prohibition agent, wink, wink?"

88
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,960
 Like pretending that he wasn't.

89
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,760
 And the guy said, "Oh yeah, of course, there you go."

90
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,240
 Well, that badge is amazing.

91
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,080
 Where'd you get it from?

92
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,600
 And he said, "I'll show you where it came from."

93
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,440
 Wow.

94
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,600
 And they took him straight down the station.

95
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,800
 Wow.

96
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,120
 They also said props were very important to their whole act,

97
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,120
 didn't they?

98
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,040
 They were auditioning for the circus at all times.

99
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,520
 But they love props, so they kept with them

100
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,840
 in their, in their satchel a string of fish, apparently,

101
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,480
 a picture of milk, some trombones, a piece of gold.

102
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,040
 Oh, this is Mary Poppins' s satchel.

103
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,440
 When you said a picture of milk, do you mean...

104
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,120
 I don't mean a milk portrait, James.

105
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,520
 Hi, we are milk photographers,

106
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,320
 and we'd like to come into your bath, please.

107
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,960
 LAUGHTER

108
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,520
 But the best part they had was this thing that one of them invented.

109
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,880
 I think it was Izzy, who invented it as the Einstein,

110
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,720
 was an artificial gullet.

111
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,880
 And this was so that he could pretend to drink in a bar

112
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,400
 without actually having to drink,

113
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,400
 because then he's sort of condoning the drinking.

114
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,320
 So it was an artificial gullet.

115
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,280
 It was a rubber bag that he hid inside his shirt.

116
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,080
 It was connected by a rubber tube to a funnel

117
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,120
 that was sewn into his vest pocket.

118
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,200
 And so he'd asked for a drink.

119
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,400
 The bummer would serve him a drink, and then he'd pretend to drink it,

120
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,520
 well, actually pouring it into his front pocket,

121
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,840
 where it got siphoned into this sack

122
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,640
 that he was hiding in his belly.

123
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,280
 That's really cool. That's amazing.

124
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,200
 A lot of effort. I like the tricks as well,

125
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,280
 because these guys were playing tricks on the drinkers,

126
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,840
 but also the people manufacturing the alcohol

127
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,920
 who were known as the moon shiners.

128
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,400
 They had amazing tricks as well to get past the agents

129
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,560
 who were trying to bust them.

130
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,000
 My favorite one is they developed these things

131
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 that were shoes that had cow hooves on the bottom.

132
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,800
 So when it looked like they'd found some tracks

133
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,600
 of a human-making moon shine, he said, "Ah, no, it's just a cow."

134
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,800
 Oh, it's just a cow walking along the two legs.

135
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,280
 Yes.

136
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,280
 Towards this abandoned still of alcohol.

137
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,600
 Well, we'll never solve it.

138
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,800
 [LAUGHTER]

139
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,040
 It was amazing.

140
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:10,360
 These guys, Einstein and Smith, they arrested 180 rabbis.

141
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,960
 And sometimes-- so Einstein was Jewish himself.

142
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,680
 And he once got told that he didn't look Jewish enough

143
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,680
 to go into this bar, which really annoyed him

144
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,880
 because he was Jewish, but he was a prohibition agent.

145
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,440
 So he sent along a non-Jewish agent

146
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,880
 and who did get it and then arrested them anyway.

147
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,840
 Well, is he Einstein went into a bar once?

148
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,080
 And the barman recognized him.

149
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,840
 And he said, that's you, that Izzy Epstein, isn't it?

150
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,800
 And the guy said, don't you mean Izzy Einstein?

151
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,560
 And then they got into a big argument.

152
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,440
 And Izzy said, I bet you one drink that is Izzy Einstein.

153
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,560
 [LAUGHTER]

154
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,400
 They bet the drink, and when he poured in the drink,

155
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,680
 he coughed him and said, I've got some pretty bad news

156
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,680
 for your hair guys.

157
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,400
 [LAUGHTER]

158
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,280
 People were very stupid in prohibition,

159
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,280
 aren't they?

160
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,120
 No signs.

161
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,800
 But the rabbi thing is interesting,

162
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,680
 because one of the only ways you could get alcohol

163
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,280
 during prohibition, at least at the start,

164
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,400
 we've got a bit of laksa, was if you're a priest or a rabbi,

165
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,720
 because you might need wine in your any religious rituals.

166
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,280
 And so suddenly, the number of priests and rabbis

167
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,280
 really skyrocketed during this period.

168
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,520
 And in California, where there are a lot of Catholics,

169
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,040
 very Catholic region, suddenly, the amount of wine

170
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,560
 being made for the sacrament increased by 700%.

171
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,960
 [LAUGHTER]

172
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,800
 Everyone extremely religious.

173
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,680
 I like that.

174
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,000
 They used to-- other methods that they would sort of get

175
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,200
 the alcohol is, from the Canadian border,

176
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:38,560
 they would fire alcohol torpedoes underneath the great lakes

177
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,320
 towards the American side.

178
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,800
 Yeah, so there was an agent who was sitting in the lake

179
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,040
 one day fishing, and this thing just went underneath them.

180
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,320
 And there was that, and they found it.

181
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,480
 And it was a torpedo packed with alcohol on the inside.

182
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,720
 Well, because they used to-- the boats,

183
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,240
 when they were smuggling sort of whiskey in, let's say,

184
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,080
 sometimes there'd be a police raid on the boats.

185
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,320
 And so a lot of boats would suddenly dump all their whiskey

186
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,400
 and disappear, let's say they're coming up to Coney Island.

187
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,600
 And so it used to actually wash up on beaches.

188
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,960
 You'd be on the beach.

189
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,640
 And a whole case of whiskey would just wash up for you.

190
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,120
 Wow.

191
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,440
 It was a good time.

192
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,640
 I found a--

193
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,960
 [LAUGHTER]

194
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,960
 It was a happy time.

195
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,760
 They also used to put them in canned fruit.

196
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,760
 So there's a liquid with the fruit.

197
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,320
 Well, the liquid would be the alcohol.

198
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,320
 So they would do that.

199
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,040
 Yeah.

200
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,600
 And what you were saying about the agents,

201
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,120
 they had a sort of interesting situation with their agents

202
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,240
 where some of them were amazing in doing

203
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,200
 these fancy dress box things.

204
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,840
 But other ones, they were so underpaid

205
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,520
 that they were susceptible to bribes.

206
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,280
 So they were being paid to be prohibition agents.

207
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,280
 They were being paid less than garbage collectors

208
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,320
 were being paid.

209
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,760
 So they were really susceptible to these bribes.

210
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,000
 And one in 10 of the prohibition agents actually

211
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,520
 got dismissed from being caught for taking bribes.

212
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,880
 It's a huge rate of, yeah, using them as smugglers themselves.

213
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,640
 So they tried to bring prohibition to Australia.

214
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:59,440
 You had a vote in Queensland in the 1930s

215
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,720
 and you voted against it in enormous numbers.

216
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,040
 [LAUGHTER]

217
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:11,040
 The biggest democratic turn out ever after that.

218
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,880
 But there was one place where they did have it.

219
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,320
 And that was in the Australian capital territory.

220
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:15,840
 OK.

221
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,600
 So--

222
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,280
 Bunch of squares, right, guys?

223
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,680
 Yeah.

224
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,400
 Cool.

225
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,120
 Well, kind of, but for a little while,

226
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,840
 the only place where you could get alcohol in the capital

227
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,360
 territory was in Parliament House.

228
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:27,960
 Wow.

229
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,480
 Everyone else had to go over the border,

230
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,920
 but you could get it in there.

231
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,680
 And the guy who was behind this whole law

232
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,200
 was a guy called King O'Malley.

233
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,720
 And he, according to Wikipedia,

234
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,280
 is particularly remembered for his role

235
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,440
 in the establishments of the Commonwealth Bank,

236
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,840
 the selection of Canberra as a national capital

237
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:47,080
 and taking the U out of the name of the Australian Labour Party.

238
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,760
 Really?

239
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,760
 That was him.

240
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,680
 Equally important contribution to the nation of Australia.

241
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,760
 People who campaign are very interested.

242
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,160
 People who are so devoted to campaign.

243
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,080
 So there was one woman called Carrie Nation.

244
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,640
 This was after Maine outlawed alcohol in 1851.

245
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,520
 So they did it well before the rest of the states.

246
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,840
 But the law was repealed.

247
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,160
 She was really unhappy that alcohol was on sale again.

248
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:15,000
 So she and her associates would smash up bars with axes.

249
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,320
 This is a very devout, sweet looking Christian lady.

250
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,040
 Dozens of women would turn up and sing hymns,

251
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,280
 and then Carrie would smash the bar with an axe.

252
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,080
 And she was frequently being fined,

253
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,800
 but she paid all the fines by selling souvenir axes.

254
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,000
 [LAUGHTER]

255
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,880
 It was very much a women's movement thing, a lot of it, wasn't it?

256
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,960
 And to be fair, there was a lot of problems with alcohol

257
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,680
 and sort of wife beating the town of the century

258
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,720
 and a lot of violence.

259
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,760
 But yeah, the women's movement, they

260
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,280
 used to have a lot of temperance meetings

261
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,960
 about how to make prohibition work because it wasn't working.

262
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,800
 There were a few meetings where they suggested ways

263
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,520
 of punishing drinkers more, some of these suggestions

264
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,200
 that women put forward were that people

265
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,600
 caught drinking or selling alcohol, we should say,

266
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,920
 because it wasn't illegal to drink.

267
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,080
 It was illegal to sell alcohol, wasn't it?

268
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,080
 People caught selling alcohol should it be sterilized?

269
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,560
 Or one woman suggested they should be locked up

270
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,600
 in a bottle-shaped cage in town centers

271
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,480
 so that you could walk past and cheer at them.

272
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,120
 And another one suggested they should be hung by the tongue

273
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,320
 from a plane and flown over the US.

274
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,760
 Whoa!

275
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,120
 Someone needs a drink.

276
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,200
 [LAUGHTER]

277
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,600
 Calm down.

278
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,520
 Such a resource-heavy punishment as well.

279
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,720
 One plane per person.

280
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,440
 [LAUGHTER]

281
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,240
 No, because you could get more than one person on a plane.

282
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,360
 Depends on the size of the plane.

283
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,640
 If you got like a Brian error, an easy budget airline.

284
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,280
 Yeah, there's a couple of budget airlines here.

285
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,720
 -Jet Star? -Jet Star.

286
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,480
 Yeah.

287
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,720
 -Tiger hour? -Local reference.

288
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,560
 Take.

289
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,840
 Have you-- it doesn't count when you ask the audience

290
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,680
 at a local rep.

291
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,640
 What's a good bit to say here?

292
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,840
 [LAUGHTER]

293
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,600
 Hey, we need to move on in a sec to our next fact.

294
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,640
 Oh, can I-- I've got such good boot lagging trial

295
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:08,400
 that this was in L.A. and there was a trial that was looking

296
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,920
 into whether someone had been boot lagging

297
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,920
 had been illegally selling alcohol.

298
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,440
 But it all turned on its head.

299
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,800
 And in the end, the jury itself ended up

300
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,840
 being put on trial after they drank all of the evidence.

301
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,960
 [LAUGHTER]

302
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,600
 OK, it is time for fact number two.

303
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,880
 And that is Chazinski.

304
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,960
 My fact is that spider wrestling was banned in the Philippines

305
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:35,920
 because children found it more entertaining than going to lessons.

306
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,680
 Which is unsurprising, really.

307
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,640
 So it's a big deal.

308
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,560
 In the Philippines, it has been for a number of decades.

309
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,560
 And there are lots of instances of educational districts

310
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,480
 banning it.

311
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,000
 And so the earliest I could find is a 1982 article.

312
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,320
 But there's a 2003 report which says,

313
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,320
 loads of districts banned spider wrestling

314
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,360
 because it turned out there was a lot of truancy

315
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,720
 because boys were going out and hunting spiders

316
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,520
 for their wrestling matches rather than going to school.

317
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,160
 And also, it was thought to be a slippery slope

318
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,720
 on the road to being a gambling addict.

319
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,200
 And it still kind of is.

320
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,640
 It thought was the first step on the way

321
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,080
 to a serious gambling problem.

322
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,800
 And it's basically school boys.

323
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,680
 And always boys, never girls in the Philippines,

324
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,760
 find two spiders, and they peel them on a stick.

325
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,960
 And they make them fight each other.

326
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,800
 And then they put tiny amounts of money on it.

327
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,880
 I'll add the way you said in the Philippines,

328
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,400
 as if in the UK it's just girls doing it.

329
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,920
 Oh, it's a very feminist game in the UK.

330
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,800
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

331
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,840
 Equal representation.

332
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,680
 It does sound pretty exciting.

333
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,680
 Yeah.

334
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,480
 How's it by speaking?

335
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,520
 Well, they wrestle until one of them is overpowered.

336
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,520
 And there are various-- sometimes they separate them

337
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,120
 before they kill each other, these spiders.

338
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,760
 Which must be very hard, I imagine.

339
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,200
 Break it up there.

340
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,880
 Above the belt.

341
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,880
 Some of the formal fights, I can't believe they're

342
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,760
 a formal fight, but there are formal fights.

343
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,320
 They have polystyrene foam on the ground,

344
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,480
 so spider won't hurt itself if it plummets from the stick.

345
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,280
 Despite the fact that famously spiders are not hurt

346
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,960
 when they fall to the ground.

347
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,760
 Is that famous?

348
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,840
 It's--

349
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,560
 I think you're thinking you've cat.

350
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,960
 I'm thinking of cats.

351
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,960
 You have been fighting the wrong animals.

352
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,840
 I've only researched cat fighting cats.

353
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,680
 Very much a women's spot cat fighting as well.

354
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:24,040
 Oh, technically, though, that was genius.

355
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,720
 Just on the technical.

356
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,400
 I just say how a spider can win a spider fight.

357
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,200
 Oh, yeah.

358
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,440
 Because there are not very good ways.

359
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,720
 OK, it's already spider listening.

360
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,160
 Here's some more tips.

361
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,760
 If you kill the other spider, you've won, well done.

362
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,720
 If you seriously enter the other spider, you've won.

363
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,920
 Or if you manage to wrap the other spider in a cocoon,

364
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,560
 then you have won.

365
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,560
 Wow.

366
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,720
 Some spiders try to escape, as you would,

367
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,080
 by dropping off the stick and weaving a thread.

368
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,960
 So hang on a thread.

369
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,600
 But if your spider does that three times,

370
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,080
 it's disqualified, and you've lost.

371
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,080
 Wow.

372
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,640
 So you can't get away that easy.

373
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,440
 I was looking into different spiders

374
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,680
 and their fighting abilities that if they were brought

375
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,280
 to the fight, what they could bring.

376
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,400
 So they are the same species, I guess, these ones.

377
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,400
 That's being the Philippines.

378
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,920
 I guess there's a particular species

379
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,160
 that gets used to a lot called the argyope spider,

380
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,800
 which is apparently a pretty cool spider in the ring.

381
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,960
 Or on the stick.

382
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,560
 But now you've got some better ones.

383
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,800
 So yeah, so this is just spiders from around the world.

384
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,840
 So there's the different fighting styles

385
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,840
 that you can have.

386
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:23,880
 There's the fishing spider who uses the patient's style.

387
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,960
 Place cards with it.

388
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:29,720
 Yeah, so it waits on the edge of a water just silently.

389
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,200
 That would have worked really well if that wasn't a one-player game.

390
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,320
 [LAUGHTER]

391
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,240
 But technically, brilliant.

392
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,680
 [LAUGHTER]

393
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,520
 Sorry, Dan.

394
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,200
 Well, no, it sits on the edge of a water,

395
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,440
 and it just patiently waits until it sees the prey coming.

396
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,480
 And then it goes for it.

397
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,520
 And it has a great success, but it stays very still.

398
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,600
 So that's the patience.

399
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,120
 There's the spitter, which is the spitting spider.

400
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,400
 It spits a mixture of venom, glue, and silk at its prey,

401
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,840
 so it captures it, and it kind of kills it with the venom.

402
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,080
 So that's an amazing technique that you could use.

403
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,000
 There's the mimic.

404
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,800
 This is one that uses a little bit of silk

405
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,560
 where they emulate a female moth, and they attract male moths

406
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,480
 to the scent, and they land on it, and they get stuck,

407
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,400
 and they bring them up, and then they kill them.

408
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,480
 And then there's the bite right there.

409
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,360
 Wait, hang on, hang on.

410
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,160
 No, go on.

411
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,880
 [LAUGHTER]

412
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,440
 Well, the moth one is not spider versus moth, these fights.

413
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,720
 Does it trick the other spider into thinking,

414
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,360
 well, it's a moth?

415
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,880
 Where's my spider opponent?

416
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,200
 And then it bounces.

417
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,080
 No, you're right.

418
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,360
 I've gone, I've gone mixed species, martial arts there.

419
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,680
 Yeah.

420
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,720
 [LAUGHTER]

421
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,200
 That is definitely no use for that.

422
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,440
 Yeah, the vibrator is a nice one.

423
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,120
 This is the--

424
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,080
 [LAUGHTER]

425
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,480
 --it goes onto other spiders' webs,

426
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,800
 and it mimics the vibrations of an insect that's caught,

427
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,760
 or another spider walking across it,

428
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,240
 but it doesn't get stuck itself.

429
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,880
 And then the spider comes to eat its prey,

430
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,240
 but then gets eaten itself.

431
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,360
 Yeah, nice, that's great.

432
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,680
 But you can't really put spiders of different species

433
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,720
 against each other, can you?

434
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,040
 Because they're just so different.

435
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,320
 You kind of like have a tarantula

436
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,560
 against a money spider, because that's just not going to work.

437
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,280
 Well, there are weight categories, so that wouldn't work.

438
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:04,760
 Ah, there.

439
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,760
 Yeah.

440
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,840
 [LAUGHTER]

441
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,520
 Just because the longest spider sperm is twice as long

442
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,160
 as a smallest spider, it's just a fact I have here.

443
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,480
 But it's an example of the difference between the different spiders.

444
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,640
 What fighting style would that be called?

445
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,320
 It's like the drowning style.

446
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,160
 Oh, my goodness.

447
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,640
 Crickets fight, as well.

448
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,160
 Oh, yeah.

449
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,640
 Yeah, you have crickets-- well, they're

450
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,280
 made to fight by evil humans.

451
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,440
 But this was a huge thing in China.

452
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,960
 And it was banned during communist times,

453
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,960
 because it seemed to be a bourgeois hobby,

454
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,440
 making crickets fight each other.

455
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,960
 But they are given herbal baths before each fight there,

456
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:48,280
 and said, I'm not kidding, they're put near water with herbs in it.

457
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,960
 They're given a maggot before a fight to incentivize them.

458
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,320
 They are trained by fighting their coaches,

459
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,440
 holding mouse whiskers to see if they can successfully

460
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,520
 wrestle, you know, like a sparring thing.

461
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,600
 And they get conjugal visits from lady crickets, as well.

462
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,520
 They do, do they?

463
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,320
 Yeah, do they?

464
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,320
 They do, do they?

465
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,920
 Before a fight, because I was reading one trainer saying

466
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,680
 that it relaxes them if they get to have sex before a fight.

467
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,760
 These crickets.

468
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,120
 Because like you would hear about sports people not

469
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,040
 having sex before fights.

470
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,440
 Crickets, for example.

471
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,360
 Yes.

472
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,800
 Crickets, crickets, all right.

473
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,960
 That was technically very good.

474
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,080
 Thank you, James.

475
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,600
 Well, in these-- so in these cricket fights,

476
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,840
 I did try and find out whether any people cheat in the cricket fights.

477
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:37,160
 But it turns out that if you Google cricket cheats,

478
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,320
 it's very hard to find.

479
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:43,800
 But the Chinese cricket thing is it is amazing,

480
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,360
 because culturally, it was very much part of the emperors

481
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:50,000
 used to have crickets in their bedside table, basically.

482
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 Because people would go to sleep to the sound of crickets.

483
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,440
 It would be very relaxing.

484
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,280
 Still to this day, $63 million is spent annually

485
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,880
 on tending to pet crickets.

486
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,720
 And like the spiders, there's no casualty in the cricket

487
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,160
 fighting.

488
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,480
 They sort of gnash their teeth at each other.

489
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,280
 And then the loser is the first cricket to just turn away.

490
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,680
 Just be like, oh, I can't do this anymore.

491
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,480
 And it's like, oh, game over.

492
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,920
 Yeah, Mr. Cricket, number one wins.

493
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:18,120
 They do treat the spiders very well as well in their Philippines.

494
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,200
 They're trained up, and they're given this special diet,

495
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,560
 like proper athletes.

496
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,240
 And they're fed on chili peppers,

497
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,200
 because that's thought to make them a bit more aggro.

498
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,240
 And then they're starved for the day before the fight,

499
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,760
 because again, that makes you kind of angry and uptight.

500
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,880
 But it's thought that the best spider to get

501
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,640
 is one that lives on electricity lines,

502
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,720
 because the electricity pulsing through your body

503
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,160
 gives you special kind of magic powers, like a super spider.

504
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,680
 Wow.

505
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,000
 So they're the most powerful fighters.

506
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,840
 It's not true.

507
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,120
 Oh.

508
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,720
 This is the opinion of turning old boys down.

509
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:51,120
 To make a whipspider really aggressive,

510
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,960
 you can shave its legs.

511
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,680
 Really?

512
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,840
 Because they are notably third-wave feminists,

513
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,520
 and they don't like that kind of thing.

514
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,360
 They're not doing it for you.

515
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,320
 They're not doing it for anybody.

516
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:05,240
 Why does that piss them off?

517
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,120
 Well, basically, what it is is they kind of,

518
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,320
 rather than normally fight, they do air punches at each other,

519
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,680
 and the way that you feel it is in the hair on your legs,

520
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,480
 and so if it can't feel the air punches of the other guy,

521
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,720
 it doesn't recognize that it's been aggressive towards it,

522
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,680
 and so then it will be more aggressive towards the other spider.

523
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,520
 So the way they fight is essentially by fanning each other.

524
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,200
 Pretty much.

525
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,920
 Oh, that's hardcore than I thought.

526
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,480
 He's spiders.

527
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,080
 Do you know how scientists do experiments on Black Widow spiders?

528
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,640
 I just really like this.

529
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,480
 No.

530
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,560
 They have to intimidate Black Widow spiders,

531
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,880
 but obviously Black Widow is quite dangerous.

532
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,120
 So they have jelly fingers, and they have to prod the Black Widow

533
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,920
 with a gelatin finger.

534
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,640
 Oh, really?

535
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,400
 Yeah.

536
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,160
 That's rather sweet.

537
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:52,680
 That makes sense.

538
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,480
 It does make sense.

539
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,400
 It makes perfect sense.

540
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,320
 It would be a more interesting fact if I said,

541
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,240
 do you know how they do it?

542
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,440
 They just go right in there and rest me in person.

543
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:07,400
 Female spiders, quite scary to male spiders, very often.

544
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,760
 Obviously, we know there's a lot of cannibalism in the spider world.

545
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,320
 Femals are always eating the males rather than having sex with them,

546
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,840
 often just before it, instead.

547
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,880
 They decide they're hungry rather than horny.

548
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,160
 And spiders have developed all these ways

549
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,520
 to combat that male spider.

550
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,880
 So there's one male spider that emits this airborne chemical,

551
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,120
 which is kind of like the Rohit male of the spider world.

552
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,320
 It knocks out.

553
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,040
 Well, it makes her kind of woozy.

554
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,920
 So this chemical makes her a bit sleepy,

555
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,320
 and she doesn't fight back, and she doesn't eat him.

556
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,640
 And then there's another one, which practices bondage.

557
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,240
 So male spiders will sort of play a bit of footsie.

558
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,320
 Yeah.

559
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,520
 That's someone who's in danger of being eaten by their partner.

560
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,800
 They start tickling their legs,

561
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,840
 and then really quickly weave the silk all around them.

562
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,080
 So they tie their legs together,

563
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,360
 and then they can have sex with them again without being eaten.

564
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,880
 It's called a bridal veil when some spiders do that.

565
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,520
 That's so much nicer than you saying it was bondage, right?

566
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,760
 Well, this is nursery web spiders.

567
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,160
 They have to tie females down with silk shackles,

568
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,400
 basically, not to be eaten.

569
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,280
 And scientists know this, because they

570
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,160
 decided to block up the male's spinnerets.

571
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,920
 So they couldn't weave the thing over the female,

572
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:22,160
 and then the males always got eaten in those experiments.

573
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,640
 Which is pretty rough on the male.

574
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,160
 Yeah.

575
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,920
 Says, we're just going to take away the one thing

576
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,880
 you can do to defend yourself.

577
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,480
 In you go, good luck on your date.

578
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,920
 I found a couple of things.

579
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:38,120
 This fact was about this practice of spider wrestling

580
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,800
 being banned in the Philippines.

581
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,040
 So I looked into a few other things.

582
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,200
 They've been banned in the Philippines.

583
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,920
 And just one that I thought was really interesting.

584
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:49,160
 Their president, Deterte, very recently,

585
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,160
 banned tourists from going to a place called Borrake.

586
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,000
 This is fresh in the news as we're recording it.

587
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,480
 This is one of the top tourist destinations

588
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,840
 that they have in the Philippines.

589
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,520
 It turns over an annual $1 billion.

590
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,840
 It's massive for them.

591
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,080
 And it's because a few hundred businesses

592
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,400
 had sewage waste problems that they weren't dealing with.

593
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,360
 So he's shut it down for six months.

594
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,240
 So one of the leading tourist places in the world right now

595
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,480
 is complete lockdown.

596
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,960
 No one is allowed to go to.

597
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,200
 So financially, it's going to absolutely ruin them.

598
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,400
 It's going to be very interesting.

599
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,600
 And then this is really weird.

600
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,320
 Supposedly, the song "My Way" by Frank Sinatra

601
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,840
 has been banned by karaoke use in the Philippines,

602
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,160
 not officially, but most people have taken it off of them.

603
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,800
 Because the only way is Deterte's way.

604
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,800
 This has been over 10 or so years,

605
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,640
 people have been getting into violent fights.

606
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,480
 There's been deaths off the back of people

607
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,200
 getting up and going, I'm going to sing "My Way,"

608
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,040
 start singing it.

609
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:43,600
 Why?

610
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,560
 They think that they're just saying something

611
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,640
 of huge arrogance on stage.

612
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,320
 It's what they think.

613
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,400
 They haven't got great answers.

614
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,160
 But there's been six deaths associated with "My Way"

615
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,440
 at karaoke.

616
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,080
 And so they've just taken it off all the machines going,

617
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,840
 we can't afford a death in our karaoke club.

618
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,400
 Let's sing "Bee-Gees" instead.

619
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,400
 Stay in our life.

620
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,880
 Stay in our life.

621
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,880
 Stay in our life.

622
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,680
 Stay in our life.

623
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,200
 Stay in our life.

624
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,040
 Stay in our life.

625
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,040
 Stay in our life.

626
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,040
 Stay in our life.

627
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,680
 Alright, let's move on.

628
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,160
 OK, it is time for fact number three.

629
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,640
 And that is "My Fact."

630
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,680
 "My Fact This Week" is that there are more people pretending

631
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:24,800
 to be Vikings in the game "Vikings War of Clans"

632
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,960
 than there were ever actual Vikings on Earth.

633
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,880
 [LAUGHTER]

634
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,840
 It's not incredible.

635
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,320
 That's amazing.

636
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,280
 Yeah, so I got sent this fact in by a very good friend

637
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,000
 of the podcast.

638
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,160
 He's appeared on a few times.

639
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,320
 He's called "Leven Skyrus," a Belgian scientist comedian.

640
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,000
 And he was watching a video, which they explained

641
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,280
 that there were 20 million Vikings on this game and growing.

642
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,880
 And so he went to verify it.

643
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,480
 He went to a page on Wikipedia that showed

644
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,440
 the total population of Scandinavia in the year 1,000.

645
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,600
 He found it was less than 1 million.

646
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,920
 Vikings lasted from the year 793 to 1066.

647
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,800
 So about 300 years, roughly 12 generations

648
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,360
 that would leave to 12 million Vikings.

649
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,560
 And that's if all the Scandinavians were Vikings.

650
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,680
 So it's a big number underneath the 20 million.

651
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,960
 So we have more Vikings in this game than ever were in real life.

652
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,920
 I would still back the actual Vikings in a fight

653
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,160
 against the people playing this game.

654
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,840
 [LAUGHTER]

655
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,640
 I was looking at some other games to see

656
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,840
 if there were more of the real things and the actual players.

657
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,360
 Oh, OK, yeah.

658
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,040
 I was looking at Farmville.

659
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,320
 Do you remember Farmville?

660
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,320
 Yeah.

661
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,680
 So at one stage, there were 311 million people

662
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,480
 playing it worldwide.

663
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,800
 Do you think there are more or less actual farmers in the world

664
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,960
 than us?

665
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,480
 More.

666
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,000
 I mean, there are far fewer than that.

667
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,160
 More.

668
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,280
 I say it's exactly the same.

669
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,280
 Exactly.

670
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,040
 To the number.

671
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,320
 To the number three and one million.

672
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,400
 The internet seems to think there are 570 million farms

673
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,520
 in the world, so they're a little bit off.

674
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,520
 Damn, that was right.

675
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,520
 Yeah.

676
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,520
 That's a very rare occurrence.

677
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,520
 I'm right.

678
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,520
 So I'll take that.

679
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,400
 And FIFA 18 came out in 2018.

680
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,600
 And their number of users went up to 1.6 million.

681
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,240
 Now, do you think there are more or fewer footballers?

682
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,960
 Actual footballers in the world than that.

683
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,560
 What professional footballers?

684
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,000
 People who are signed up to FIFA.

685
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,800
 What's footballers?

686
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,560
 Oh, a fewer.

687
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,560
 I don't think there are 1.6 million footballers.

688
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,320
 OK.

689
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:20,200
 According to FIFA, there are 265 million footballers in the world.

690
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,200
 No.

691
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,200
 We wouldn't know if there was.

692
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,200
 Shit.

693
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,200
 I know.

694
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,200
 But this is according to FIFA on their actual website.

695
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:31,800
 To get everyone together, you've got one footballer to two farmers.

696
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,880
 Our priorities are way out of whack.

697
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:40,160
 And because they have to fight over the same field as well.

698
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,400
 Apparently, and this is genuinely according to FIFA,

699
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,080
 there are 26 million registered footballers in China.

700
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,240
 And that is more than the population of Australia,

701
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,800
 which is 24 million.

702
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,280
 Wow.

703
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:52,960
 It's too many.

704
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,480
 It can't be.

705
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,640
 I found a few weird games that exist as online games, as digital games.

706
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,080
 So Donald Rumsfeld, the former Secretary of Defense of America

707
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,960
 and the Bush administration, he released a game.

708
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,480
 Really?

709
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,200
 Yeah, it's called Churchill Solitaire.

710
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,000
 And it's a game that Churchill used to play.

711
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,280
 It was sort of different rules, and Churchill was obsessed with it.

712
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,080
 And so Donald Rumsfeld teamed up with this team to do it.

713
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:21,000
 He learned it from a man who used to play it with Winston Churchill.

714
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,120
 And so he thought these are amazing rules.

715
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,680
 And when they released the game--

716
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,840
 this is the quote from the company that released it--

717
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,000
 Mr. Rumsfeld can't code.

718
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,680
 He doesn't much even know how to use a computer.

719
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,360
 But he was guided by his young digital-minded associates

720
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,240
 who assembled the video games with the same method

721
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,080
 he used to rule the Pentagon, a flurry of memos called snowflakes.

722
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,000
 As a result, Churchill Solitaire is likely

723
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,040
 to be the only video game developed by an 83-year-old man

724
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,920
 using a dictaphone to record memos for the program.

725
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,440
 [LAUGHTER]

726
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,640
 Hey, why didn't he just use his fingers to phone?

727
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,120
 [LAUGHTER]

728
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,800
 Well, just a celebrity video games is a thing.

729
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,200
 So Kanye Weston, out in 2016, he was working on a video game.

730
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,240
 And the aim of the computer game that Kanye West was launching

731
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,560
 was that you had to escort his deceased mother

732
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,680
 through the gates of heaven by holding her up to the light.

733
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,960
 Oh, my God.

734
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,720
 Now, it's not out yet.

735
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,320
 A lot of people claim it's not going to happen.

736
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,840
 But in September, last year, the game studio developing it.

737
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,320
 So no, no, no.

738
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,080
 We're still working on the Kanye West deceased mum game.

739
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:27,880
 Wow.

740
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,840
 So look out for that.

741
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,640
 There is a new app, which is available in China.

742
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,560
 And it's a game where you applaud speeches

743
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,240
 by Chinese President Xi Jinping.

744
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,760
 [LAUGHTER]

745
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,280
 And you have to applaud them as much as you can

746
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,800
 by just mashing your button as much as you can.

747
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,320
 Oh, my God.

748
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,560
 And apparently, the record for button mashing on this game

749
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:56,120
 is 60 button presses per second.

750
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,360
 Wow.

751
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,640
 That sounds like a fee for start, doesn't it?

752
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,960
 [LAUGHTER]

753
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,320
 Apparently, that's true.

754
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,920
 I guess if you use multiple fingers,

755
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,400
 if you can bash 10 fingers at once.

756
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:06,920
 Yeah.

757
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,360
 And if you think you're going to get arrested,

758
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:12,720
 if you don't get it, you can achieve great things.

759
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,360
 Michael Jackson released a Compute Game.

760
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,280
 Yeah.

761
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,840
 He was involved with the Bay Compute Games,

762
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,080
 but in one of the Michael Jackson's moonwalker,

763
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,800
 you had to control Jackson to save kidnapped children

764
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,600
 from a villain.

765
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,120
 Wow.

766
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:28,280
 Please.

767
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,360
 And they played versions of his hits in the background.

768
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,200
 You normally defeated the villains by moonwalking

769
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,800
 or by doing dance moves.

770
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,040
 It was a great game.

771
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:35,640
 Did you play it?

772
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,720
 Yeah, as a kid a lot.

773
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,520
 Yeah.

774
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,840
 Yeah, I didn't think of how you just put it in context,

775
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,160
 but yeah, sort of regret it now.

776
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,840
 [LAUGHTER]

777
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,520
 That was the great video game crash of the 1980s.

778
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,960
 It was a huge deal in video game, well, but it was 1982.

779
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,360
 It was when all video games went really weird and really

780
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,080
 crap, because everyone jumped on board, made them cheaply.

781
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,320
 There was one in 1982 that came out, which

782
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,400
 was called Communist Mutants from Space.

783
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,400
 This was obviously late Cold War.

784
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,440
 And the way it worked was you were fighting against aliens

785
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,080
 from a Communist planet, which was called Ruski.

786
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:15,640
 And it was amazing the Democrat planet.

787
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:19,120
 And the aliens leader was a mother creature.

788
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:24,000
 And she'd gone mad from drinking too much irradiated vodka.

789
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,120
 How do they think of these things?

790
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,120
 Wow.

791
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,080
 Hey, we need to move on, Shirley, to our next bag.

792
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,400
 You know Second Life?

793
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,520
 Second Life, a big online thing.

794
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,880
 Second Life has support groups called things like,

795
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,840
 has Second Life taken over your life?

796
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,080
 Unfortunately, they take place inside Second Life.

797
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,160
 Oh, my God.

798
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:43,840
 Oh, wow.

799
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,760
 So you have to be playing to take part?

800
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,640
 That's so sad.

801
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,720
 I just had a look at a couple of games that Vikings might play.

802
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,840
 Oh, cool, yeah.

803
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,440
 So one game that they played in the longhouse

804
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,280
 after their meal was called Haneutu Cast.

805
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,600
 And their game was you threw bones at other players

806
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,320
 with the intent of causing an injury.

807
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:08,080
 And then you used their bones for the next game.

808
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:13,040
 Can I throw a bone pretty hard to actually extract another bone?

809
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:17,040
 Is that where the phrase "throw me a bone" comes from?

810
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,000
 I shouldn't think so.

811
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,760
 No.

812
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:23,000
 OK, sorry, no James, you got no?

813
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,920
 Oh, just that another one is they had swimming competitions.

814
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,600
 But the goal of their swimming competitions

815
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,280
 was not who could get their quickest.

816
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,800
 It was who could hold his opponent underwater for the longest.

817
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,240
 That would be so much more exciting to watch.

818
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,960
 Just as an Olympic suggestion, too.

819
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,520
 All right, it's time to move on to our final fact of the show.

820
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,440
 And that is James.

821
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,000
 OK, my fact this week is that Aussie Osborne's 1992

822
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,320
 TAR was called No Martos.

823
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,640
 His 2018 TAR is called No Martos 2.

824
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:05,560
 And has he confirmed how many in the series?

825
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,480
 Oh, I think he's going to go forever, isn't he?

826
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,880
 Yeah, he's going to.

827
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,080
 In between, he did a retirement sucks, TAR.

828
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,440
 Wow, yeah.

829
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,960
 But the No Martos was originally No Martias.

830
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,600
 And then he was misdiagnosed now with multiple sclerosis.

831
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,040
 And then he renamed it No Martos.

832
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,560
 And he thought he would never TAR again.

833
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,880
 But he is out there now.

834
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,360
 Yeah, I love-- I was looking into TAR names, generally,

835
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,440
 because they're all quite fun.

836
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,560
 Sometimes bands do have some really good ones.

837
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:39,280
 Peter Gabriel of Genesis, he used to have a great one.

838
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,720
 So Peter Gabriel once had a TAR, which

839
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,360
 was called China 1984 TAR.

840
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,040
 The interesting thing about this is that TAR took place

841
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:50,520
 in Europe and the USA in 1980.

842
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,600
 [LAUGHTER]

843
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:57,640
 So it had no relevance whatsoever to China 1984 TAR.

844
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,960
 He also did playtime, 1988 TAR.

845
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,680
 That took place in 1982.

846
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,600
 Yeah, he just thought-- he thought, ah, it doesn't matter.

847
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,800
 Just any old shitty name's going to work.

848
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,120
 Elson John once had louder than a concord,

849
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,760
 but not quite as pretty, which I think

850
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,440
 is a really nice name for a TAR.

851
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:14,920
 Yeah.

852
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,200
 One direction once TAR'd under the name, take me home,

853
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,200
 which doesn't imply that they really

854
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,720
 want to be there in the first place.

855
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,840
 Some 41 did a reunion tour, and they called it.

856
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,840
 Don't call it a sum back tour.

857
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,560
 Very--

858
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:31,320
 You were the consultant James on that tour, weren't you?

859
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,120
 Elson John first-- his first retirement tour

860
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,160
 was announced in 1977.

861
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,520
 And he is now doing his final retirement tour.

862
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,880
 I think it's going to take him three years

863
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,920
 to get all the way around the world.

864
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,680
 Yeah.

865
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,920
 But Ozzy Osborne was a bit of a rocker, wasn't he?

866
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,800
 Still is, I guess, although he doesn't drink any more.

867
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,760
 And I think one of the reasons is because according

868
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,240
 to his autobiography, he was invited in 1981

869
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,880
 to a meeting with the head of CBS Europe.

870
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,520
 And he decided to lighten the mood a bit

871
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,520
 by doing a strip tease on the table,

872
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:05,040
 and then kissing the record executive on the lips.

873
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,640
 And Sharon later on told him that he'd actually

874
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,760
 performed a Nazi goose step up and down on the table

875
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,680
 before dipping his testicles into the executive's wine

876
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,400
 and then urinating in it.

877
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:19,080
 Wow.

878
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,680
 He really-- he doesn't disappoint.

879
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,240
 You think you're going to look up Ozzy Osborne

880
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,920
 and find out he's not actually as mad as he seems.

881
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,840
 But my Lord, he--

882
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,000
 It's amazing.

883
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,360
 He once got bored and he dragged a shark--

884
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,520
 don't know where he got the shark, no information on that--

885
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,480
 dragged a shark into the hotel room, a dead shark,

886
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,920
 threw the hotel room window, soaked in blood,

887
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,160
 and covered the hotel room in shark's blood.

888
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,200
 What?

889
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,240
 He did genuinely bite the head of two live doves

890
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,360
 during a meeting with a PR manager.

891
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,360
 So he'd meant to let them off at the end of the meeting.

892
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,600
 But she says something that really irritated him.

893
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,160
 So instead of that, he took out two of his three

894
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,200
 live doves and bit the head.

895
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,240
 Two of his three?

896
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,240
 Yeah.

897
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:03,160
 No, what third one must have been absolutely terrifying?

898
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:07,280
 This magic actor's gone very sour.

899
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,400
 You know the tiny-- if you've seen spinal tap,

900
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,880
 you know they do a thing where they have to perform.

901
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,000
 They get the dimensions wrong and they

902
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,640
 perform in front of this tiny stone hand, which is about--

903
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,320
 it's about 12 inches high and it's at a tall feet high.

904
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,200
 So Black Sabbath went on tour in 1983.

905
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,120
 They had a replica of Stonehenge on stage,

906
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:26,480
 and it was so massive that it didn't fit on stage.

907
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,280
 None of it could fit on stage.

908
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,360
 So I think-- really?

909
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,800
 I think they wanted it and they got it in a meter.

910
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,080
 So I think that's where that comes from.

911
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:32,600
 Wow.

912
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,760
 Yeah, that's so cool.

913
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,960
 That must have been onto that, yeah?

914
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,400
 I really like the Aussie Osborne, obviously, famously.

915
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,480
 So the doves story, but the famous one is the bat story.

916
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,120
 So he bit off a bat's head on stage.

917
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:47,680
 And the story goes that, in fact, he didn't know it was a bat.

918
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,640
 He thought it was a rubber bat that a fan had thrown on to stage,

919
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,480
 picked it up, bit the head off, and then

920
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,240
 realized that it was an actual bat.

921
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,840
 And that's the big story of Aussie Osborne

922
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,080
 from his, from his drunken drug days.

923
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:04,280
 But a few years back in 2010, he was trying to convert part

924
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,640
 of his Buckingham Shura state.

925
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,440
 But he couldn't, because it turned out

926
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,560
 that he had bats in the loft, and there were protected species.

927
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,160
 So unless he promised to protect them,

928
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,040
 he wasn't able to do anything about it.

929
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:15,560
 Wow.

930
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,800
 Yeah, so they finally got there.

931
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:21,160
 The idea was that, like you say, that's what happened.

932
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,840
 He said that-- sorry about this, but he said that as he

933
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,600
 bit it off, he felt the head twitch in his mouth.

934
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,600
 OK.

935
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,760
 But according to the guy who claims that he was the one who

936
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,320
 threw it on stage called Mark Neal, he'd

937
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,600
 found the bat two weeks earlier, and it was alive.

938
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,600
 But by the time he'd taken to it, it was long dead.

939
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,960
 And so he'd actually put a dead bat in his mouth,

940
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,920
 according to that guy.

941
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,440
 Wow.

942
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,720
 I don't know who to believe.

943
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,160
 I don't know, which is worse.

944
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,600
 No, they're both pretty awful.

945
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,560
 Yeah, they're both horrible.

946
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,320
 Yeah.

947
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,720
 So the drummer was called Bill Ward.

948
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,000
 And Tony Iomey, one of the other band members,

949
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,880
 was a known prankster.

950
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,640
 But they particularly loved setting the drummer on fire.

951
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,480
 So apparently, they related a story of one show where Tony

952
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,560
 said to Bill, I'd like to set you on fire now, please.

953
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,560
 And apparently, Bill said, I don't really

954
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,680
 want you to, not now.

955
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,480
 And then at the end of the show, he came out to Tony and said,

956
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,640
 OK, well, I have to go home in a minute.

957
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,600
 So do you want to set me on fire or what?

958
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,600
 He did.

959
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,720
 He sprayed him with lighter fluid, covered him

960
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,320
 in lighter fluid, lit a match.

961
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,720
 And he was wearing polyester pants,

962
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,760
 and said that he went up extremely fast.

963
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,760
 And he was on the floor screaming and crying.

964
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,560
 And Tony said, I couldn't help him,

965
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:31,360
 because I was so busy laughing.

966
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,000
 It actually turned out to be quite serious.

967
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,560
 And I felt very bad for him yet.

968
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,440
 And ambulance was called.

969
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,880
 And again, in 1980, he got third degree burns,

970
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,480
 because they set fire to him again.

971
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,360
 He just kept on volunteering for this.

972
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,320
 Wow.

973
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,640
 Well, he's actually-- he's one of the few people on Earth

974
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,680
 who's had his entire DNA sequenced for some years.

975
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,520
 He's one of the ones you mean?

976
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,800
 Sorry, Ozzy Osborne, yeah.

977
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,200
 He's one of the few people who's had his DNA sequenced.

978
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,400
 So James Watson had his-- a few others.

979
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,400
 And he was done by a scientist who wanted to work out

980
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,920
 how the hell he's still alive, basically.

981
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,640
 They were like, does he have a special gene?

982
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,080
 Does he have anything?

983
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,720
 And he does have a few oddities within his body.

984
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,160
 Nothing major.

985
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:14,320
 He's got a bit of neanderthal in him as well.

986
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,560
 Oh, but we all do, don't we?

987
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,320
 Yeah.

988
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,240
 But he's probably got a bit more than most.

989
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,120
 Yeah, he's up to like 70%.

990
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,960
 No, we all have like two or three percent, don't we?

991
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,200
 But they found that he had a little bit more than most.

992
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,320
 Yeah.

993
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:31,560
 But yeah, so he had a few bits that could process alcohol

994
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,480
 a bit more addictively.

995
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,680
 And that's why it made him an addict.

996
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,160
 So they did learn a lot from doing it.

997
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,160
 They said he was 2.6 times more likely to hallucinate

998
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,200
 on marijuana.

999
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,080
 He had an increased risk of cocaine addiction.

1000
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,840
 He was six times more likely than average

1001
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,440
 to be alcohol dependent.

1002
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,320
 But weirdly, the person who conducted the test said,

1003
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,880
 Aussie Aussie wants kryptonite is caffeine, which is bizarre,

1004
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,920
 because he's taken every single drug under the sun.

1005
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,920
 But apparently, yeah, he's extremely slow to metabolize

1006
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,760
 coffee.

1007
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,680
 So if you think he's a bit of a mess right now,

1008
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,320
 it's just because of the coffee thing.

1009
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:06,320
 That's massive.

1010
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,000
 That kind of explains one thing I've got here, which

1011
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,200
 is that he keeps failing driving tests.

1012
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,480
 And one time, he fell asleep during the test.

1013
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,760
 That's a major, isn't it?

1014
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,000
 Yeah, that's a major.

1015
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,440
 I think June's a lack of caffeine, maybe, I don't know.

1016
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,080
 He said, when I woke up, there was a note on the seat saying,

1017
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:25,920
 you have failed.

1018
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:32,840
 And yet, the examiner left him the car.

1019
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,320
 Yeah.

1020
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,680
 Do you want to hear the least rock and roll story I've ever

1021
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,200
 heard that was a piece of the Guardian about the worst gigs ever?

1022
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,000
 It was very funny.

1023
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,160
 And it was the Jonas Brothers.

1024
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,560
 Yeah, they started off as a Christian rock band,

1025
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,800
 I think, maybe they still are.

1026
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,160
 But Joe Jonas said, we played a strawberry festival where

1027
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,800
 they actually judge strawberries with taste test and everything.

1028
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,120
 It was the most awkward gig we've ever done.

1029
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,280
 There was hardly anyone there.

1030
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,280
 And the sound cut out halfway through.

1031
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,280
 We had to perform without any sound equipment.

1032
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,880
 These poor kids.

1033
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,680
 They said, we didn't get angry and smash the place up.

1034
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,640
 But we did get asked to judge the winning strawberry

1035
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,520
 as compensation for the bad sound.

1036
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,480
 The winning strawberry was fantastic.

1037
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,320
 Oh.

1038
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,720
 I thought they would have deliberately

1039
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,440
 given it to a really shit strawberry.

1040
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:17,960
 No.

1041
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,200
 What's a raspberry or something?

1042
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,440
 They're nice boys.

1043
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,040
 Sorry, I just wanted to count about it.

1044
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:27,840
 Biting their head off two dubs, but leaving the third terrified one.

1045
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:32,640
 I've got a good first time to count from someone we know.

1046
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,920
 Rock and roll account.

1047
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,360
 So Freddie Mercury used to have parties.

1048
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,640
 And obviously, he was a wild child.

1049
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:44,760
 And he had parties and he used to invite small people or dwarves

1050
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,240
 to the parties and put bowls on the heads full of cocaine

1051
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,720
 so they could be easily consumed.

1052
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,240
 Which of our friends was at this party?

1053
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,040
 I don't like to say, but this same friend did say he also

1054
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,280
 toured with black Sabbath.

1055
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,440
 And because the done thing is to throw a TV out the window.

1056
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,360
 You've got to throw a TV out the window at some point.

1057
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,120
 So I think actually one member of black Sabbath

1058
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,480
 was on the way to the airport once and stopped the driver

1059
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,640
 and said, got turned around.

1060
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,600
 I've forgotten something and got driven back.

1061
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,640
 Ran upstairs, brought the TV downstairs and threw it

1062
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,800
 in the swimming pool of the hotel.

1063
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,040
 Then got back in the cabin and said, OK, thank God.

1064
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:19,240
 Right, we better go to the airport.

1065
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,120
 But this guy that we know did also tour black Sabbath

1066
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,480
 and decided he had to throw a TV out of the hotel window.

1067
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,520
 But forgot to one plug it.

1068
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,320
 So apparently ended up with the TV just dangling precariously.

1069
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:32,160
 From the 24th of a hotel.

1070
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,240
 Do you know what one of the main rules that are rolling stones?

1071
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:38,480
 Gig is these days for the band.

1072
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,000
 I don't know.

1073
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,360
 You're not allowed to touch Keith Richards' shepherd's pie.

1074
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,200
 And there's that. Are you for this one for something though?

1075
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,200
 No, no.

1076
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,320
 He's completely clean these days.

1077
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,240
 And he has a shepherd's pie before every gig.

1078
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,480
 And in 1989 in Toronto, he found that someone had tried it

1079
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,880
 before him, and he refused to go on stage

1080
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,160
 until a new shepherd's pie was made and brought to him.

1081
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,840
 He said, nobody touches the shepherd's pie

1082
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,720
 till I've been in there.

1083
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,240
 Don't bust my crust, baby.

1084
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,640
 He didn't say that.

1085
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,400
 He said it.

1086
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,080
 The mom's a great lyricist.

1087
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,440
 That's amazing.

1088
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,200
 We're going to have to wrap up shortly.

1089
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,880
 Anything before we do?

1090
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,400
 Just quickly, I've got one, which is that just on tours,

1091
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,200
 recent tours, Beyonce had a thing a few years ago where she's in.

1092
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:31,800
 No, she had this whole thing where she really enraged a lot

1093
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,920
 of people from comments that she had made.

1094
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,840
 And critics were really attacking her.

1095
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,560
 The newspapers were attacking her.

1096
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,240
 But she was still going on this tour.

1097
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,760
 So she decided to sell as part of her merchandise.

1098
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,800
 merchandise.

1099
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,000
 You want some merchandise?

1100
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,360
 It was a new Jersey tour.

1101
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,480
 I'm not merchandise.

1102
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:57,160
 So weird when your mouth just goes somewhere else.

1103
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,400
 You're on the road, and it's just merchandise.

1104
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,400
 Whoa!

1105
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:07,680
 She sold, as merchandise, boycott Beyonce t-shirts

1106
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,960
 to cash in on the fact she was like,

1107
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,960
 "Of people are going to hate me.

1108
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,960
 Sure, I'll just keep selling stuff.

1109
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,200
 It will just still generate funds.

1110
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,840
 Yeah, so you could buy at her gig, boycott Beyonce t-shirts."

1111
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,840
 Really?

1112
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,520
 What's the other thing about Elvis' manager did that as well?

1113
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:25,600
 Yeah, Elvis' manager sold, I hate Elvis t-shirts, I think,

1114
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,600
 or an I hate Elvis piece of merchandise

1115
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,560
 to make sure he could also cash in on the people

1116
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,560
 who weren't huge Elvis fans.

1117
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,600
 What else do you want to do?

1118
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,360
 Can I very quickly tell you a few?

1119
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,640
 I just looked up a few tribute bands who tour.

1120
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,880
 And just the names tribute bands have other best things

1121
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,880
 in the world.

1122
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,320
 So there's the Red Not Chili Peppers.

1123
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,840
 There's an Alanis Morissette tribute band

1124
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,200
 called Alanish, but it just sounds

1125
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,840
 like they're a bit like someone called Alan.

1126
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:53,040
 But there's a tribute band to yes, who are called no.

1127
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:59,160
 There's non-Jovie, earth wind for hire, earth wind of fire,

1128
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,880
 proxy music.

1129
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,160
 And my favourite is a rather poorly gentlemen,

1130
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:07,840
 but he goes by the name, "Blobby Williams."

1131
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:11,600
 OK, that is it.

1132
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,320
 That is all of our facts.

1133
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,960
