00:00:05,00:00:09,"(ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding)"
00:00:09,00:00:13,Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:13,00:00:16,"of no such thing as a fish,"
00:00:16,00:00:20,a weekly podcast this week coming to you live
00:00:20,00:00:22,from Brisbane!
00:00:22,00:00:25,(audience cheering)
00:00:25,00:00:29,My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here
00:00:29,00:00:32,"with Annachos Insky, Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:32,00:00:33,and James Harkin.
00:00:33,00:00:36,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:36,00:00:39,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:39,00:00:42,"And in a particular order, here we go."
00:00:42,00:00:44,"Starting with you, Andy."
00:00:44,00:00:47,"My fact is that during prohibition in America,"
00:00:47,00:00:50,"the cops responsible for busting speakeasies did so,"
00:00:50,00:00:55,"dressed as grave diggers, farmers, statues,"
00:00:55,00:00:58,"opga goers, cowboys, judges,"
00:00:58,00:01:00,"bums, and old Italian matrons."
00:01:00,00:01:02,(audience laughing)
00:01:02,00:01:04,What was the penultimate one there?
00:01:04,00:01:05,Bums.
00:01:05,00:01:06,"Yeah, yeah."
00:01:06,00:01:07,Like homeless people.
00:01:07,00:01:08,Like homeless people.
00:01:08,00:01:09,"Exactly, yeah."
00:01:09,00:01:10,What was the statues?
00:01:10,00:01:13,There weren't just as bottoms on the way
00:01:13,00:01:14,to a fancy dress party.
00:01:14,00:01:16,(laughing)
00:01:16,00:01:17,"Although they probably could have done,"
00:01:17,00:01:18,they were incredible.
00:01:18,00:01:21,"They had, there were two agents and they had this massive,"
00:01:21,00:01:24,they were the best prohibition enforcing agents.
00:01:24,00:01:28,"So prohibition, 1919 to 1933, alcohol,"
00:01:28,00:01:29,sales were banned across America.
00:01:29,00:01:34,And there were these guys called Isadot Einstein and Mo Smith.
00:01:34,00:01:37,"And they arrested 4,900 people in--"
00:01:37,00:01:38,Wow.
00:01:38,00:01:39,"Yeah, I know."
00:01:39,00:01:40,And the conviction rate was 95%.
00:01:40,00:01:42,They were incredible.
00:01:42,00:01:44,But they were mainly famous for their disguises.
00:01:44,00:01:47,So they had a dressing up box.
00:01:47,00:01:50,"They dressed as tram conductors, or opera singers sometimes."
00:01:50,00:01:51,"They went to the Democratic National Convention,"
00:01:51,00:01:52,disguised as politicians.
00:01:52,00:01:54,"But where would they, so like, if they were opera singers,"
00:01:54,00:01:56,"were they just going to bars and just being like,"
00:01:56,00:01:58,"""Hello."""
00:01:58,00:02:00,"What does an opera singer look like, I guess, as a question?"
00:02:00,00:02:01,Yeah.
00:02:01,00:02:03,"Sometimes they would, there were some bars"
00:02:03,00:02:07,"which were next to opera houses, I think."
00:02:07,00:02:09,"But they, yeah, go on."
00:02:09,00:02:11,"They like to go for all the different countries as well,"
00:02:11,00:02:12,didn't they?
00:02:12,00:02:13,All the different nationalities.
00:02:13,00:02:17,"So apparently they dressed as a German pickle packer,"
00:02:17,00:02:20,"a pol, I mean, that's just nice to say, isn't it?"
00:02:20,00:02:22,(laughing)
00:02:22,00:02:25,"A Polish count, a Hungarian violinist,"
00:02:25,00:02:27,"a Yiddish gravedigger, a French matredi,"
00:02:27,00:02:31,"an Italian fruit vendor, and a Russian fisherman."
00:02:31,00:02:32,They were incredible.
00:02:32,00:02:34,"Supposedly, Einstein and Smith, both dudes,"
00:02:34,00:02:36,"once posed as husband and wife,"
00:02:36,00:02:39,which is a much easier costume for one of them
00:02:39,00:02:40,than it is for the other one.
00:02:40,00:02:41,'Cause these were two big guys.
00:02:41,00:02:43,"And they said that no one would,"
00:02:43,00:02:45,no one suspected them of being prohibition agents
00:02:45,00:02:46,because they just looked unlikely.
00:02:46,00:02:47,So the pickle thing.
00:02:47,00:02:50,"And everyone was so pissed, they didn't notice."
00:02:50,00:02:52,Sometimes they would go up to a bar
00:02:52,00:02:54,"and they'd say, ""I'm a prohibition agent."
00:02:54,00:02:55,"""Let me in."""
00:02:55,00:02:56,"And they would say, ""Yeah, very funny."
00:02:56,00:02:57,"""In you go."""
00:02:57,00:02:59,And then they'd go in and arrest everybody.
00:02:59,00:03:01,"Wow, that's like jediism."
00:03:01,00:03:03,So that happened once to it.
00:03:03,00:03:05,He had the prohibition badge on his coat.
00:03:05,00:03:07,"And he said to him, ""Would you sell a pint of whiskey"
00:03:07,00:03:11,"""to a deserving prohibition agent, wink, wink?"""
00:03:11,00:03:12,Like pretending that he wasn't.
00:03:12,00:03:14,"And the guy said, ""Oh yeah, of course, there you go."""
00:03:14,00:03:16,"Well, that badge is amazing."
00:03:16,00:03:17,Where'd you get it from?
00:03:17,00:03:19,"And he said, ""I'll show you where it came from."""
00:03:19,00:03:20,Wow.
00:03:20,00:03:21,And they took him straight down the station.
00:03:21,00:03:22,Wow.
00:03:22,00:03:26,"They also said props were very important to their whole act,"
00:03:26,00:03:27,didn't they?
00:03:27,00:03:30,They were auditioning for the circus at all times.
00:03:30,00:03:32,"But they love props, so they kept with them"
00:03:32,00:03:35,"in their, in their satchel a string of fish, apparently,"
00:03:35,00:03:39,"a picture of milk, some trombones, a piece of gold."
00:03:39,00:03:42,"Oh, this is Mary Poppins' s satchel."
00:03:42,00:03:44,"When you said a picture of milk, do you mean..."
00:03:44,00:03:46,"I don't mean a milk portrait, James."
00:03:46,00:03:48,"Hi, we are milk photographers,"
00:03:48,00:03:50,"and we'd like to come into your bath, please."
00:03:50,00:03:52,LAUGHTER
00:03:52,00:03:56,But the best part they had was this thing that one of them invented.
00:03:56,00:03:58,"I think it was Izzy, who invented it as the Einstein,"
00:03:58,00:04:00,was an artificial gullet.
00:04:00,00:04:04,And this was so that he could pretend to drink in a bar
00:04:04,00:04:06,"without actually having to drink,"
00:04:06,00:04:09,because then he's sort of condoning the drinking.
00:04:09,00:04:10,So it was an artificial gullet.
00:04:10,00:04:12,It was a rubber bag that he hid inside his shirt.
00:04:12,00:04:15,It was connected by a rubber tube to a funnel
00:04:15,00:04:17,that was sewn into his vest pocket.
00:04:17,00:04:19,And so he'd asked for a drink.
00:04:19,00:04:21,"The bummer would serve him a drink, and then he'd pretend to drink it,"
00:04:21,00:04:23,"well, actually pouring it into his front pocket,"
00:04:23,00:04:25,where it got siphoned into this sack
00:04:25,00:04:27,that he was hiding in his belly.
00:04:27,00:04:29,That's really cool. That's amazing.
00:04:29,00:04:31,"A lot of effort. I like the tricks as well,"
00:04:31,00:04:34,"because these guys were playing tricks on the drinkers,"
00:04:34,00:04:36,but also the people manufacturing the alcohol
00:04:36,00:04:38,who were known as the moon shiners.
00:04:38,00:04:42,They had amazing tricks as well to get past the agents
00:04:42,00:04:43,who were trying to bust them.
00:04:43,00:04:46,My favorite one is they developed these things
00:04:46,00:04:49,that were shoes that had cow hooves on the bottom.
00:04:49,00:04:51,So when it looked like they'd found some tracks
00:04:51,00:04:54,"of a human-making moon shine, he said, ""Ah, no, it's just a cow."""
00:04:54,00:04:56,"Oh, it's just a cow walking along the two legs."
00:04:56,00:04:58,Yes.
00:04:58,00:05:00,Towards this abandoned still of alcohol.
00:05:00,00:05:02,"Well, we'll never solve it."
00:05:02,00:05:04,[LAUGHTER]
00:05:04,00:05:06,It was amazing.
00:05:06,00:05:10,"These guys, Einstein and Smith, they arrested 180 rabbis."
00:05:10,00:05:12,And sometimes-- so Einstein was Jewish himself.
00:05:12,00:05:15,And he once got told that he didn't look Jewish enough
00:05:15,00:05:17,"to go into this bar, which really annoyed him"
00:05:17,00:05:19,"because he was Jewish, but he was a prohibition agent."
00:05:19,00:05:22,So he sent along a non-Jewish agent
00:05:22,00:05:24,and who did get it and then arrested them anyway.
00:05:24,00:05:27,"Well, is he Einstein went into a bar once?"
00:05:27,00:05:30,And the barman recognized him.
00:05:30,00:05:33,"And he said, that's you, that Izzy Epstein, isn't it?"
00:05:33,00:05:36,"And the guy said, don't you mean Izzy Einstein?"
00:05:36,00:05:38,And then they got into a big argument.
00:05:38,00:05:42,"And Izzy said, I bet you one drink that is Izzy Einstein."
00:05:42,00:05:44,[LAUGHTER]
00:05:44,00:05:46,"They bet the drink, and when he poured in the drink,"
00:05:46,00:05:48,"he coughed him and said, I've got some pretty bad news"
00:05:48,00:05:49,for your hair guys.
00:05:49,00:05:52,[LAUGHTER]
00:05:52,00:05:54,"People were very stupid in prohibition,"
00:05:54,00:05:55,aren't they?
00:05:55,00:05:56,No signs.
00:05:56,00:05:57,"But the rabbi thing is interesting,"
00:05:57,00:06:00,because one of the only ways you could get alcohol
00:06:00,00:06:02,"during prohibition, at least at the start,"
00:06:02,00:06:04,"we've got a bit of laksa, was if you're a priest or a rabbi,"
00:06:04,00:06:07,because you might need wine in your any religious rituals.
00:06:07,00:06:11,"And so suddenly, the number of priests and rabbis"
00:06:11,00:06:15,really skyrocketed during this period.
00:06:15,00:06:17,"And in California, where there are a lot of Catholics,"
00:06:17,00:06:20,"very Catholic region, suddenly, the amount of wine"
00:06:20,00:06:22,being made for the sacrament increased by 700%.
00:06:22,00:06:24,[LAUGHTER]
00:06:24,00:06:26,Everyone extremely religious.
00:06:26,00:06:27,I like that.
00:06:27,00:06:30,They used to-- other methods that they would sort of get
00:06:30,00:06:33,"the alcohol is, from the Canadian border,"
00:06:33,00:06:38,they would fire alcohol torpedoes underneath the great lakes
00:06:38,00:06:40,towards the American side.
00:06:40,00:06:42,"Yeah, so there was an agent who was sitting in the lake"
00:06:42,00:06:45,"one day fishing, and this thing just went underneath them."
00:06:45,00:06:46,"And there was that, and they found it."
00:06:46,00:06:49,And it was a torpedo packed with alcohol on the inside.
00:06:49,00:06:50,"Well, because they used to-- the boats,"
00:06:50,00:06:54,"when they were smuggling sort of whiskey in, let's say,"
00:06:54,00:06:56,sometimes there'd be a police raid on the boats.
00:06:56,00:06:58,And so a lot of boats would suddenly dump all their whiskey
00:06:58,00:07:00,"and disappear, let's say they're coming up to Coney Island."
00:07:00,00:07:02,And so it used to actually wash up on beaches.
00:07:02,00:07:03,You'd be on the beach.
00:07:03,00:07:06,And a whole case of whiskey would just wash up for you.
00:07:06,00:07:07,Wow.
00:07:07,00:07:08,It was a good time.
00:07:08,00:07:09,I found a--
00:07:09,00:07:10,[LAUGHTER]
00:07:10,00:07:11,It was a happy time.
00:07:11,00:07:13,They also used to put them in canned fruit.
00:07:13,00:07:15,So there's a liquid with the fruit.
00:07:15,00:07:17,"Well, the liquid would be the alcohol."
00:07:17,00:07:18,So they would do that.
00:07:18,00:07:19,Yeah.
00:07:19,00:07:22,"And what you were saying about the agents,"
00:07:22,00:07:25,they had a sort of interesting situation with their agents
00:07:25,00:07:27,where some of them were amazing in doing
00:07:27,00:07:29,these fancy dress box things.
00:07:29,00:07:31,"But other ones, they were so underpaid"
00:07:31,00:07:33,that they were susceptible to bribes.
00:07:33,00:07:36,So they were being paid to be prohibition agents.
00:07:36,00:07:38,They were being paid less than garbage collectors
00:07:38,00:07:39,were being paid.
00:07:39,00:07:41,So they were really susceptible to these bribes.
00:07:41,00:07:44,And one in 10 of the prohibition agents actually
00:07:44,00:07:46,got dismissed from being caught for taking bribes.
00:07:46,00:07:49,"It's a huge rate of, yeah, using them as smugglers themselves."
00:07:49,00:07:52,So they tried to bring prohibition to Australia.
00:07:52,00:07:59,You had a vote in Queensland in the 1930s
00:07:59,00:08:01,and you voted against it in enormous numbers.
00:08:01,00:08:06,[LAUGHTER]
00:08:06,00:08:11,The biggest democratic turn out ever after that.
00:08:11,00:08:12,But there was one place where they did have it.
00:08:12,00:08:15,And that was in the Australian capital territory.
00:08:15,00:08:15,OK.
00:08:15,00:08:16,So--
00:08:16,00:08:18,"Bunch of squares, right, guys?"
00:08:18,00:08:19,Yeah.
00:08:19,00:08:20,Cool.
00:08:20,00:08:22,"Well, kind of, but for a little while,"
00:08:22,00:08:24,the only place where you could get alcohol in the capital
00:08:24,00:08:27,territory was in Parliament House.
00:08:27,00:08:27,Wow.
00:08:27,00:08:29,"Everyone else had to go over the border,"
00:08:29,00:08:30,but you could get it in there.
00:08:30,00:08:32,And the guy who was behind this whole law
00:08:32,00:08:35,was a guy called King O'Malley.
00:08:35,00:08:36,"And he, according to Wikipedia,"
00:08:36,00:08:38,is particularly remembered for his role
00:08:38,00:08:40,"in the establishments of the Commonwealth Bank,"
00:08:40,00:08:42,the selection of Canberra as a national capital
00:08:42,00:08:47,and taking the U out of the name of the Australian Labour Party.
00:08:47,00:08:48,Really?
00:08:48,00:08:49,That was him.
00:08:49,00:08:53,Equally important contribution to the nation of Australia.
00:08:53,00:08:55,People who campaign are very interested.
00:08:55,00:08:58,People who are so devoted to campaign.
00:08:58,00:09:01,So there was one woman called Carrie Nation.
00:09:01,00:09:03,This was after Maine outlawed alcohol in 1851.
00:09:03,00:09:05,So they did it well before the rest of the states.
00:09:05,00:09:06,But the law was repealed.
00:09:06,00:09:09,She was really unhappy that alcohol was on sale again.
00:09:09,00:09:15,So she and her associates would smash up bars with axes.
00:09:15,00:09:18,"This is a very devout, sweet looking Christian lady."
00:09:18,00:09:20,"Dozens of women would turn up and sing hymns,"
00:09:20,00:09:22,and then Carrie would smash the bar with an axe.
00:09:22,00:09:24,"And she was frequently being fined,"
00:09:24,00:09:26,but she paid all the fines by selling souvenir axes.
00:09:26,00:09:30,[LAUGHTER]
00:09:30,00:09:32,"It was very much a women's movement thing, a lot of it, wasn't it?"
00:09:32,00:09:34,"And to be fair, there was a lot of problems with alcohol"
00:09:34,00:09:36,and sort of wife beating the town of the century
00:09:36,00:09:37,and a lot of violence.
00:09:37,00:09:39,"But yeah, the women's movement, they"
00:09:39,00:09:41,used to have a lot of temperance meetings
00:09:41,00:09:43,about how to make prohibition work because it wasn't working.
00:09:43,00:09:46,There were a few meetings where they suggested ways
00:09:46,00:09:49,"of punishing drinkers more, some of these suggestions"
00:09:49,00:09:51,that women put forward were that people
00:09:51,00:09:53,"caught drinking or selling alcohol, we should say,"
00:09:53,00:09:54,because it wasn't illegal to drink.
00:09:54,00:09:57,"It was illegal to sell alcohol, wasn't it?"
00:09:57,00:10:00,People caught selling alcohol should it be sterilized?
00:10:00,00:10:02,Or one woman suggested they should be locked up
00:10:02,00:10:05,in a bottle-shaped cage in town centers
00:10:05,00:10:07,so that you could walk past and cheer at them.
00:10:07,00:10:10,And another one suggested they should be hung by the tongue
00:10:10,00:10:12,from a plane and flown over the US.
00:10:12,00:10:14,Whoa!
00:10:14,00:10:16,Someone needs a drink.
00:10:16,00:10:19,[LAUGHTER]
00:10:19,00:10:20,Calm down.
00:10:20,00:10:24,Such a resource-heavy punishment as well.
00:10:24,00:10:25,One plane per person.
00:10:25,00:10:29,[LAUGHTER]
00:10:29,00:10:33,"No, because you could get more than one person on a plane."
00:10:33,00:10:34,Depends on the size of the plane.
00:10:34,00:10:38,"If you got like a Brian error, an easy budget airline."
00:10:38,00:10:40,"Yeah, there's a couple of budget airlines here."
00:10:40,00:10:42,-Jet Star? -Jet Star.
00:10:42,00:10:43,Yeah.
00:10:43,00:10:45,-Tiger hour? -Local reference.
00:10:45,00:10:47,Take.
00:10:47,00:10:50,Have you-- it doesn't count when you ask the audience
00:10:50,00:10:51,at a local rep.
00:10:51,00:10:53,What's a good bit to say here?
00:10:53,00:10:56,[LAUGHTER]
00:10:56,00:10:59,"Hey, we need to move on in a sec to our next fact."
00:10:59,00:11:02,"Oh, can I-- I've got such good boot lagging trial"
00:11:02,00:11:08,that this was in L.A. and there was a trial that was looking
00:11:08,00:11:09,into whether someone had been boot lagging
00:11:09,00:11:11,had been illegally selling alcohol.
00:11:11,00:11:13,But it all turned on its head.
00:11:13,00:11:15,"And in the end, the jury itself ended up"
00:11:15,00:11:18,being put on trial after they drank all of the evidence.
00:11:18,00:11:21,[LAUGHTER]
00:11:21,00:11:24,"OK, it is time for fact number two."
00:11:24,00:11:26,And that is Chazinski.
00:11:26,00:11:30,My fact is that spider wrestling was banned in the Philippines
00:11:30,00:11:35,because children found it more entertaining than going to lessons.
00:11:35,00:11:37,"Which is unsurprising, really."
00:11:37,00:11:38,So it's a big deal.
00:11:38,00:11:41,"In the Philippines, it has been for a number of decades."
00:11:41,00:11:44,And there are lots of instances of educational districts
00:11:44,00:11:45,banning it.
00:11:45,00:11:48,And so the earliest I could find is a 1982 article.
00:11:48,00:11:50,"But there's a 2003 report which says,"
00:11:50,00:11:53,loads of districts banned spider wrestling
00:11:53,00:11:55,because it turned out there was a lot of truancy
00:11:55,00:11:57,because boys were going out and hunting spiders
00:11:57,00:12:00,for their wrestling matches rather than going to school.
00:12:00,00:12:03,"And also, it was thought to be a slippery slope"
00:12:03,00:12:05,on the road to being a gambling addict.
00:12:05,00:12:07,And it still kind of is.
00:12:07,00:12:08,It thought was the first step on the way
00:12:08,00:12:10,to a serious gambling problem.
00:12:10,00:12:11,And it's basically school boys.
00:12:11,00:12:14,"And always boys, never girls in the Philippines,"
00:12:14,00:12:16,"find two spiders, and they peel them on a stick."
00:12:16,00:12:17,And they make them fight each other.
00:12:17,00:12:19,And then they put tiny amounts of money on it.
00:12:19,00:12:21,"I'll add the way you said in the Philippines,"
00:12:21,00:12:24,as if in the UK it's just girls doing it.
00:12:24,00:12:26,"Oh, it's a very feminist game in the UK."
00:12:26,00:12:27,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:12:27,00:12:28,Equal representation.
00:12:28,00:12:31,It does sound pretty exciting.
00:12:31,00:12:32,Yeah.
00:12:32,00:12:35,How's it by speaking?
00:12:35,00:12:37,"Well, they wrestle until one of them is overpowered."
00:12:37,00:12:40,And there are various-- sometimes they separate them
00:12:40,00:12:43,"before they kill each other, these spiders."
00:12:43,00:12:44,"Which must be very hard, I imagine."
00:12:44,00:12:47,Break it up there.
00:12:47,00:12:48,Above the belt.
00:12:48,00:12:50,"Some of the formal fights, I can't believe they're"
00:12:50,00:12:52,"a formal fight, but there are formal fights."
00:12:52,00:12:54,"They have polystyrene foam on the ground,"
00:12:54,00:12:57,so spider won't hurt itself if it plummets from the stick.
00:12:57,00:12:59,Despite the fact that famously spiders are not hurt
00:12:59,00:13:00,when they fall to the ground.
00:13:00,00:13:02,Is that famous?
00:13:02,00:13:03,It's--
00:13:03,00:13:05,I think you're thinking you've cat.
00:13:05,00:13:07,I'm thinking of cats.
00:13:07,00:13:10,You have been fighting the wrong animals.
00:13:10,00:13:14,I've only researched cat fighting cats.
00:13:14,00:13:18,Very much a women's spot cat fighting as well.
00:13:18,00:13:24,"Oh, technically, though, that was genius."
00:13:24,00:13:25,Just on the technical.
00:13:25,00:13:29,I just say how a spider can win a spider fight.
00:13:29,00:13:30,"Oh, yeah."
00:13:30,00:13:31,Because there are not very good ways.
00:13:31,00:13:32,"OK, it's already spider listening."
00:13:32,00:13:34,Here's some more tips.
00:13:34,00:13:36,"If you kill the other spider, you've won, well done."
00:13:36,00:13:38,"If you seriously enter the other spider, you've won."
00:13:38,00:13:40,"Or if you manage to wrap the other spider in a cocoon,"
00:13:40,00:13:42,then you have won.
00:13:42,00:13:43,Wow.
00:13:43,00:13:45,"Some spiders try to escape, as you would,"
00:13:45,00:13:48,by dropping off the stick and weaving a thread.
00:13:48,00:13:48,So hang on a thread.
00:13:48,00:13:50,"But if your spider does that three times,"
00:13:50,00:13:53,"it's disqualified, and you've lost."
00:13:53,00:13:54,Wow.
00:13:54,00:13:55,So you can't get away that easy.
00:13:55,00:13:58,I was looking into different spiders
00:13:58,00:14:00,and their fighting abilities that if they were brought
00:14:00,00:14:02,"to the fight, what they could bring."
00:14:02,00:14:04,"So they are the same species, I guess, these ones."
00:14:04,00:14:05,That's being the Philippines.
00:14:05,00:14:06,I guess there's a particular species
00:14:06,00:14:09,"that gets used to a lot called the argyope spider,"
00:14:09,00:14:11,which is apparently a pretty cool spider in the ring.
00:14:11,00:14:12,Or on the stick.
00:14:12,00:14:14,But now you've got some better ones.
00:14:14,00:14:16,"So yeah, so this is just spiders from around the world."
00:14:16,00:14:18,So there's the different fighting styles
00:14:18,00:14:19,that you can have.
00:14:19,00:14:23,There's the fishing spider who uses the patient's style.
00:14:23,00:14:24,Place cards with it.
00:14:24,00:14:29,"Yeah, so it waits on the edge of a water just silently."
00:14:29,00:14:32,That would have worked really well if that wasn't a one-player game.
00:14:32,00:14:35,[LAUGHTER]
00:14:35,00:14:37,"But technically, brilliant."
00:14:37,00:14:39,[LAUGHTER]
00:14:39,00:14:40,"Sorry, Dan."
00:14:40,00:14:42,"Well, no, it sits on the edge of a water,"
00:14:42,00:14:45,and it just patiently waits until it sees the prey coming.
00:14:45,00:14:46,And then it goes for it.
00:14:46,00:14:48,"And it has a great success, but it stays very still."
00:14:48,00:14:49,So that's the patience.
00:14:49,00:14:52,"There's the spitter, which is the spitting spider."
00:14:52,00:14:55,"It spits a mixture of venom, glue, and silk at its prey,"
00:14:55,00:14:58,"so it captures it, and it kind of kills it with the venom."
00:14:58,00:15:01,So that's an amazing technique that you could use.
00:15:01,00:15:02,There's the mimic.
00:15:02,00:15:04,This is one that uses a little bit of silk
00:15:04,00:15:07,"where they emulate a female moth, and they attract male moths"
00:15:07,00:15:09,"to the scent, and they land on it, and they get stuck,"
00:15:09,00:15:11,"and they bring them up, and then they kill them."
00:15:11,00:15:12,And then there's the bite right there.
00:15:12,00:15:13,"Wait, hang on, hang on."
00:15:13,00:15:14,"No, go on."
00:15:14,00:15:16,[LAUGHTER]
00:15:16,00:15:20,"Well, the moth one is not spider versus moth, these fights."
00:15:20,00:15:22,"Does it trick the other spider into thinking,"
00:15:22,00:15:23,"well, it's a moth?"
00:15:23,00:15:24,Where's my spider opponent?
00:15:24,00:15:26,And then it bounces.
00:15:26,00:15:27,"No, you're right."
00:15:27,00:15:29,"I've gone, I've gone mixed species, martial arts there."
00:15:29,00:15:30,Yeah.
00:15:30,00:15:31,[LAUGHTER]
00:15:31,00:15:35,That is definitely no use for that.
00:15:35,00:15:37,"Yeah, the vibrator is a nice one."
00:15:37,00:15:39,This is the--
00:15:39,00:15:40,[LAUGHTER]
00:15:40,00:15:42,"--it goes onto other spiders' webs,"
00:15:42,00:15:46,"and it mimics the vibrations of an insect that's caught,"
00:15:46,00:15:48,"or another spider walking across it,"
00:15:48,00:15:50,but it doesn't get stuck itself.
00:15:50,00:15:51,"And then the spider comes to eat its prey,"
00:15:51,00:15:53,but then gets eaten itself.
00:15:53,00:15:54,"Yeah, nice, that's great."
00:15:54,00:15:56,But you can't really put spiders of different species
00:15:56,00:15:57,"against each other, can you?"
00:15:57,00:15:59,Because they're just so different.
00:15:59,00:16:00,You kind of like have a tarantula
00:16:00,00:16:02,"against a money spider, because that's just not going to work."
00:16:02,00:16:04,"Well, there are weight categories, so that wouldn't work."
00:16:04,00:16:04,"Ah, there."
00:16:04,00:16:05,Yeah.
00:16:05,00:16:06,[LAUGHTER]
00:16:06,00:16:10,Just because the longest spider sperm is twice as long
00:16:10,00:16:13,"as a smallest spider, it's just a fact I have here."
00:16:13,00:16:16,But it's an example of the difference between the different spiders.
00:16:16,00:16:19,What fighting style would that be called?
00:16:19,00:16:21,It's like the drowning style.
00:16:21,00:16:24,"Oh, my goodness."
00:16:24,00:16:25,"Crickets fight, as well."
00:16:25,00:16:26,"Oh, yeah."
00:16:26,00:16:28,"Yeah, you have crickets-- well, they're"
00:16:28,00:16:30,made to fight by evil humans.
00:16:30,00:16:33,But this was a huge thing in China.
00:16:33,00:16:34,"And it was banned during communist times,"
00:16:34,00:16:36,"because it seemed to be a bourgeois hobby,"
00:16:36,00:16:38,making crickets fight each other.
00:16:38,00:16:42,"But they are given herbal baths before each fight there,"
00:16:42,00:16:48,"and said, I'm not kidding, they're put near water with herbs in it."
00:16:48,00:16:51,They're given a maggot before a fight to incentivize them.
00:16:51,00:16:54,"They are trained by fighting their coaches,"
00:16:54,00:16:57,holding mouse whiskers to see if they can successfully
00:16:57,00:16:59,"wrestle, you know, like a sparring thing."
00:16:59,00:17:03,"And they get conjugal visits from lady crickets, as well."
00:17:03,00:17:04,"They do, do they?"
00:17:04,00:17:05,"Yeah, do they?"
00:17:05,00:17:07,"They do, do they?"
00:17:07,00:17:09,"Before a fight, because I was reading one trainer saying"
00:17:09,00:17:12,that it relaxes them if they get to have sex before a fight.
00:17:12,00:17:13,These crickets.
00:17:13,00:17:16,Because like you would hear about sports people not
00:17:16,00:17:18,having sex before fights.
00:17:18,00:17:19,"Crickets, for example."
00:17:19,00:17:21,Yes.
00:17:21,00:17:22,"Crickets, crickets, all right."
00:17:22,00:17:23,That was technically very good.
00:17:23,00:17:26,"Thank you, James."
00:17:26,00:17:28,"Well, in these-- so in these cricket fights,"
00:17:28,00:17:31,I did try and find out whether any people cheat in the cricket fights.
00:17:31,00:17:37,"But it turns out that if you Google cricket cheats,"
00:17:37,00:17:38,it's very hard to find.
00:17:38,00:17:43,"But the Chinese cricket thing is it is amazing,"
00:17:43,00:17:46,"because culturally, it was very much part of the emperors"
00:17:46,00:17:50,"used to have crickets in their bedside table, basically."
00:17:50,00:17:52,Because people would go to sleep to the sound of crickets.
00:17:52,00:17:53,It would be very relaxing.
00:17:53,00:17:57,"Still to this day, $63 million is spent annually"
00:17:57,00:17:59,on tending to pet crickets.
00:17:59,00:18:02,"And like the spiders, there's no casualty in the cricket"
00:18:02,00:18:03,fighting.
00:18:03,00:18:05,They sort of gnash their teeth at each other.
00:18:05,00:18:08,And then the loser is the first cricket to just turn away.
00:18:08,00:18:10,"Just be like, oh, I can't do this anymore."
00:18:10,00:18:12,"And it's like, oh, game over."
00:18:12,00:18:14,"Yeah, Mr. Cricket, number one wins."
00:18:14,00:18:18,They do treat the spiders very well as well in their Philippines.
00:18:18,00:18:20,"They're trained up, and they're given this special diet,"
00:18:20,00:18:21,like proper athletes.
00:18:21,00:18:23,"And they're fed on chili peppers,"
00:18:23,00:18:25,because that's thought to make them a bit more aggro.
00:18:25,00:18:28,"And then they're starved for the day before the fight,"
00:18:28,00:18:31,"because again, that makes you kind of angry and uptight."
00:18:31,00:18:33,But it's thought that the best spider to get
00:18:33,00:18:35,"is one that lives on electricity lines,"
00:18:35,00:18:37,because the electricity pulsing through your body
00:18:37,00:18:40,"gives you special kind of magic powers, like a super spider."
00:18:40,00:18:40,Wow.
00:18:40,00:18:42,So they're the most powerful fighters.
00:18:42,00:18:42,It's not true.
00:18:42,00:18:44,Oh.
00:18:44,00:18:45,This is the opinion of turning old boys down.
00:18:45,00:18:51,"To make a whipspider really aggressive,"
00:18:51,00:18:53,you can shave its legs.
00:18:53,00:18:54,Really?
00:18:54,00:18:56,"Because they are notably third-wave feminists,"
00:18:56,00:18:59,and they don't like that kind of thing.
00:18:59,00:19:00,They're not doing it for you.
00:19:00,00:19:01,They're not doing it for anybody.
00:19:01,00:19:05,Why does that piss them off?
00:19:05,00:19:08,"Well, basically, what it is is they kind of,"
00:19:08,00:19:11,"rather than normally fight, they do air punches at each other,"
00:19:11,00:19:14,"and the way that you feel it is in the hair on your legs,"
00:19:14,00:19:17,"and so if it can't feel the air punches of the other guy,"
00:19:17,00:19:20,"it doesn't recognize that it's been aggressive towards it,"
00:19:20,00:19:23,and so then it will be more aggressive towards the other spider.
00:19:23,00:19:26,So the way they fight is essentially by fanning each other.
00:19:26,00:19:30,Pretty much.
00:19:30,00:19:31,"Oh, that's hardcore than I thought."
00:19:31,00:19:33,He's spiders.
00:19:33,00:19:37,Do you know how scientists do experiments on Black Widow spiders?
00:19:37,00:19:38,I just really like this.
00:19:38,00:19:39,No.
00:19:39,00:19:41,"They have to intimidate Black Widow spiders,"
00:19:41,00:19:43,but obviously Black Widow is quite dangerous.
00:19:43,00:19:48,"So they have jelly fingers, and they have to prod the Black Widow"
00:19:48,00:19:49,with a gelatin finger.
00:19:49,00:19:50,"Oh, really?"
00:19:50,00:19:51,Yeah.
00:19:51,00:19:52,That's rather sweet.
00:19:52,00:19:52,That makes sense.
00:19:52,00:19:53,It does make sense.
00:19:53,00:19:56,It makes perfect sense.
00:19:56,00:19:58,"It would be a more interesting fact if I said,"
00:19:58,00:19:59,do you know how they do it?
00:19:59,00:20:01,They just go right in there and rest me in person.
00:20:01,00:20:07,"Female spiders, quite scary to male spiders, very often."
00:20:07,00:20:09,"Obviously, we know there's a lot of cannibalism in the spider world."
00:20:09,00:20:12,"Femals are always eating the males rather than having sex with them,"
00:20:12,00:20:13,"often just before it, instead."
00:20:13,00:20:15,They decide they're hungry rather than horny.
00:20:15,00:20:18,And spiders have developed all these ways
00:20:18,00:20:19,to combat that male spider.
00:20:19,00:20:22,"So there's one male spider that emits this airborne chemical,"
00:20:22,00:20:26,which is kind of like the Rohit male of the spider world.
00:20:26,00:20:27,It knocks out.
00:20:27,00:20:30,"Well, it makes her kind of woozy."
00:20:30,00:20:31,"So this chemical makes her a bit sleepy,"
00:20:31,00:20:34,"and she doesn't fight back, and she doesn't eat him."
00:20:34,00:20:37,"And then there's another one, which practices bondage."
00:20:37,00:20:41,So male spiders will sort of play a bit of footsie.
00:20:41,00:20:43,Yeah.
00:20:43,00:20:45,That's someone who's in danger of being eaten by their partner.
00:20:45,00:20:50,"They start tickling their legs,"
00:20:50,00:20:52,and then really quickly weave the silk all around them.
00:20:52,00:20:54,"So they tie their legs together,"
00:20:54,00:20:56,and then they can have sex with them again without being eaten.
00:20:56,00:20:59,It's called a bridal veil when some spiders do that.
00:20:59,00:21:03,"That's so much nicer than you saying it was bondage, right?"
00:21:03,00:21:05,"Well, this is nursery web spiders."
00:21:05,00:21:08,"They have to tie females down with silk shackles,"
00:21:08,00:21:09,"basically, not to be eaten."
00:21:09,00:21:11,"And scientists know this, because they"
00:21:11,00:21:14,decided to block up the male's spinnerets.
00:21:14,00:21:17,"So they couldn't weave the thing over the female,"
00:21:17,00:21:22,and then the males always got eaten in those experiments.
00:21:22,00:21:23,Which is pretty rough on the male.
00:21:23,00:21:24,Yeah.
00:21:24,00:21:25,"Says, we're just going to take away the one thing"
00:21:25,00:21:27,you can do to defend yourself.
00:21:27,00:21:29,"In you go, good luck on your date."
00:21:32,00:21:33,I found a couple of things.
00:21:33,00:21:38,This fact was about this practice of spider wrestling
00:21:38,00:21:39,being banned in the Philippines.
00:21:39,00:21:41,So I looked into a few other things.
00:21:41,00:21:43,They've been banned in the Philippines.
00:21:43,00:21:45,And just one that I thought was really interesting.
00:21:45,00:21:49,"Their president, Deterte, very recently,"
00:21:49,00:21:52,banned tourists from going to a place called Borrake.
00:21:52,00:21:55,This is fresh in the news as we're recording it.
00:21:55,00:21:57,This is one of the top tourist destinations
00:21:57,00:21:58,that they have in the Philippines.
00:21:58,00:22:01,It turns over an annual $1 billion.
00:22:01,00:22:02,It's massive for them.
00:22:02,00:22:05,And it's because a few hundred businesses
00:22:05,00:22:07,had sewage waste problems that they weren't dealing with.
00:22:07,00:22:09,So he's shut it down for six months.
00:22:09,00:22:13,So one of the leading tourist places in the world right now
00:22:13,00:22:14,is complete lockdown.
00:22:14,00:22:15,No one is allowed to go to.
00:22:15,00:22:18,"So financially, it's going to absolutely ruin them."
00:22:18,00:22:19,It's going to be very interesting.
00:22:19,00:22:20,And then this is really weird.
00:22:20,00:22:24,"Supposedly, the song ""My Way"" by Frank Sinatra"
00:22:24,00:22:27,"has been banned by karaoke use in the Philippines,"
00:22:27,00:22:30,"not officially, but most people have taken it off of them."
00:22:30,00:22:33,Because the only way is Deterte's way.
00:22:33,00:22:36,"This has been over 10 or so years,"
00:22:36,00:22:38,people have been getting into violent fights.
00:22:38,00:22:40,There's been deaths off the back of people
00:22:40,00:22:42,"getting up and going, I'm going to sing ""My Way,"""
00:22:42,00:22:43,start singing it.
00:22:43,00:22:43,Why?
00:22:43,00:22:45,They think that they're just saying something
00:22:45,00:22:47,of huge arrogance on stage.
00:22:47,00:22:48,It's what they think.
00:22:48,00:22:49,They haven't got great answers.
00:22:49,00:22:53,"But there's been six deaths associated with ""My Way"""
00:22:53,00:22:54,at karaoke.
00:22:54,00:22:57,"And so they've just taken it off all the machines going,"
00:22:57,00:22:59,we can't afford a death in our karaoke club.
00:22:59,00:23:02,"Let's sing ""Bee-Gees"" instead."
00:23:02,00:23:03,Stay in our life.
00:23:03,00:23:04,Stay in our life.
00:23:04,00:23:05,Stay in our life.
00:23:05,00:23:06,Stay in our life.
00:23:06,00:23:08,Stay in our life.
00:23:08,00:23:10,Stay in our life.
00:23:10,00:23:11,Stay in our life.
00:23:11,00:23:12,Stay in our life.
00:23:12,00:23:13,"Alright, let's move on."
00:23:13,00:23:16,"OK, it is time for fact number three."
00:23:16,00:23:17,"And that is ""My Fact."""
00:23:17,00:23:20,"""My Fact This Week"" is that there are more people pretending"
00:23:20,00:23:24,"to be Vikings in the game ""Vikings War of Clans"""
00:23:24,00:23:27,than there were ever actual Vikings on Earth.
00:23:27,00:23:29,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:29,00:23:30,It's not incredible.
00:23:30,00:23:31,That's amazing.
00:23:31,00:23:34,"Yeah, so I got sent this fact in by a very good friend"
00:23:34,00:23:35,of the podcast.
00:23:35,00:23:36,He's appeared on a few times.
00:23:36,00:23:39,"He's called ""Leven Skyrus,"" a Belgian scientist comedian."
00:23:39,00:23:42,"And he was watching a video, which they explained"
00:23:42,00:23:46,that there were 20 million Vikings on this game and growing.
00:23:46,00:23:47,And so he went to verify it.
00:23:47,00:23:50,He went to a page on Wikipedia that showed
00:23:50,00:23:53,"the total population of Scandinavia in the year 1,000."
00:23:53,00:23:55,He found it was less than 1 million.
00:23:55,00:23:58,Vikings lasted from the year 793 to 1066.
00:23:58,00:24:01,"So about 300 years, roughly 12 generations"
00:24:01,00:24:04,that would leave to 12 million Vikings.
00:24:04,00:24:06,And that's if all the Scandinavians were Vikings.
00:24:06,00:24:08,So it's a big number underneath the 20 million.
00:24:08,00:24:11,So we have more Vikings in this game than ever were in real life.
00:24:11,00:24:13,I would still back the actual Vikings in a fight
00:24:13,00:24:15,against the people playing this game.
00:24:15,00:24:17,[LAUGHTER]
00:24:17,00:24:19,I was looking at some other games to see
00:24:19,00:24:22,if there were more of the real things and the actual players.
00:24:22,00:24:23,"Oh, OK, yeah."
00:24:23,00:24:25,I was looking at Farmville.
00:24:25,00:24:26,Do you remember Farmville?
00:24:26,00:24:27,Yeah.
00:24:27,00:24:30,"So at one stage, there were 311 million people"
00:24:30,00:24:32,playing it worldwide.
00:24:32,00:24:35,Do you think there are more or less actual farmers in the world
00:24:35,00:24:36,than us?
00:24:36,00:24:37,More.
00:24:37,00:24:39,"I mean, there are far fewer than that."
00:24:39,00:24:40,More.
00:24:40,00:24:42,I say it's exactly the same.
00:24:42,00:24:43,Exactly.
00:24:43,00:24:44,To the number.
00:24:44,00:24:46,To the number three and one million.
00:24:46,00:24:49,The internet seems to think there are 570 million farms
00:24:49,00:24:51,"in the world, so they're a little bit off."
00:24:51,00:24:52,"Damn, that was right."
00:24:52,00:24:53,Yeah.
00:24:53,00:24:54,That's a very rare occurrence.
00:24:54,00:24:55,I'm right.
00:24:55,00:24:56,So I'll take that.
00:24:56,00:24:59,And FIFA 18 came out in 2018.
00:24:59,00:25:02,And their number of users went up to 1.6 million.
00:25:02,00:25:05,"Now, do you think there are more or fewer footballers?"
00:25:05,00:25:06,Actual footballers in the world than that.
00:25:06,00:25:08,What professional footballers?
00:25:08,00:25:11,People who are signed up to FIFA.
00:25:11,00:25:11,What's footballers?
00:25:11,00:25:12,"Oh, a fewer."
00:25:12,00:25:14,I don't think there are 1.6 million footballers.
00:25:14,00:25:15,OK.
00:25:15,00:25:20,"According to FIFA, there are 265 million footballers in the world."
00:25:20,00:25:21,No.
00:25:21,00:25:22,We wouldn't know if there was.
00:25:22,00:25:23,Shit.
00:25:23,00:25:24,I know.
00:25:24,00:25:25,But this is according to FIFA on their actual website.
00:25:25,00:25:31,"To get everyone together, you've got one footballer to two farmers."
00:25:31,00:25:35,Our priorities are way out of whack.
00:25:35,00:25:40,And because they have to fight over the same field as well.
00:25:40,00:25:42,"Apparently, and this is genuinely according to FIFA,"
00:25:42,00:25:46,there are 26 million registered footballers in China.
00:25:46,00:25:48,"And that is more than the population of Australia,"
00:25:48,00:25:50,which is 24 million.
00:25:50,00:25:52,Wow.
00:25:52,00:25:52,It's too many.
00:25:52,00:25:54,It can't be.
00:25:54,00:25:59,"I found a few weird games that exist as online games, as digital games."
00:25:59,00:26:03,"So Donald Rumsfeld, the former Secretary of Defense of America"
00:26:03,00:26:05,"and the Bush administration, he released a game."
00:26:05,00:26:06,Really?
00:26:06,00:26:08,"Yeah, it's called Churchill Solitaire."
00:26:08,00:26:10,And it's a game that Churchill used to play.
00:26:10,00:26:13,"It was sort of different rules, and Churchill was obsessed with it."
00:26:13,00:26:17,And so Donald Rumsfeld teamed up with this team to do it.
00:26:17,00:26:21,He learned it from a man who used to play it with Winston Churchill.
00:26:21,00:26:23,And so he thought these are amazing rules.
00:26:23,00:26:24,And when they released the game--
00:26:24,00:26:26,this is the quote from the company that released it--
00:26:26,00:26:29,Mr. Rumsfeld can't code.
00:26:29,00:26:31,He doesn't much even know how to use a computer.
00:26:31,00:26:34,But he was guided by his young digital-minded associates
00:26:34,00:26:36,who assembled the video games with the same method
00:26:36,00:26:40,"he used to rule the Pentagon, a flurry of memos called snowflakes."
00:26:40,00:26:42,"As a result, Churchill Solitaire is likely"
00:26:42,00:26:45,to be the only video game developed by an 83-year-old man
00:26:45,00:26:47,using a dictaphone to record memos for the program.
00:26:47,00:26:50,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:50,00:26:53,"Hey, why didn't he just use his fingers to phone?"
00:26:53,00:26:57,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:57,00:27:01,"Well, just a celebrity video games is a thing."
00:27:01,00:27:05,"So Kanye Weston, out in 2016, he was working on a video game."
00:27:05,00:27:08,And the aim of the computer game that Kanye West was launching
00:27:08,00:27:10,was that you had to escort his deceased mother
00:27:10,00:27:13,through the gates of heaven by holding her up to the light.
00:27:13,00:27:14,"Oh, my God."
00:27:14,00:27:17,"Now, it's not out yet."
00:27:17,00:27:20,A lot of people claim it's not going to happen.
00:27:20,00:27:23,"But in September, last year, the game studio developing it."
00:27:23,00:27:24,"So no, no, no."
00:27:24,00:27:27,We're still working on the Kanye West deceased mum game.
00:27:27,00:27:27,Wow.
00:27:27,00:27:29,So look out for that.
00:27:29,00:27:33,"There is a new app, which is available in China."
00:27:33,00:27:36,And it's a game where you applaud speeches
00:27:36,00:27:39,by Chinese President Xi Jinping.
00:27:39,00:27:42,[LAUGHTER]
00:27:42,00:27:45,And you have to applaud them as much as you can
00:27:45,00:27:47,by just mashing your button as much as you can.
00:27:47,00:27:49,"Oh, my God."
00:27:49,00:27:52,"And apparently, the record for button mashing on this game"
00:27:52,00:27:56,is 60 button presses per second.
00:27:56,00:27:57,Wow.
00:27:57,00:27:59,"That sounds like a fee for start, doesn't it?"
00:27:59,00:28:01,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:01,00:28:03,"Apparently, that's true."
00:28:03,00:28:04,"I guess if you use multiple fingers,"
00:28:04,00:28:06,if you can bash 10 fingers at once.
00:28:06,00:28:06,Yeah.
00:28:06,00:28:08,"And if you think you're going to get arrested,"
00:28:08,00:28:12,"if you don't get it, you can achieve great things."
00:28:12,00:28:14,Michael Jackson released a Compute Game.
00:28:14,00:28:15,Yeah.
00:28:15,00:28:16,"He was involved with the Bay Compute Games,"
00:28:16,00:28:19,"but in one of the Michael Jackson's moonwalker,"
00:28:19,00:28:21,you had to control Jackson to save kidnapped children
00:28:21,00:28:23,from a villain.
00:28:23,00:28:24,Wow.
00:28:24,00:28:28,Please.
00:28:28,00:28:30,And they played versions of his hits in the background.
00:28:30,00:28:32,You normally defeated the villains by moonwalking
00:28:32,00:28:33,or by doing dance moves.
00:28:33,00:28:35,It was a great game.
00:28:35,00:28:35,Did you play it?
00:28:35,00:28:36,"Yeah, as a kid a lot."
00:28:36,00:28:37,Yeah.
00:28:37,00:28:39,"Yeah, I didn't think of how you just put it in context,"
00:28:39,00:28:42,"but yeah, sort of regret it now."
00:28:42,00:28:43,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:43,00:28:47,That was the great video game crash of the 1980s.
00:28:47,00:28:49,"It was a huge deal in video game, well, but it was 1982."
00:28:49,00:28:52,It was when all video games went really weird and really
00:28:52,00:28:55,"crap, because everyone jumped on board, made them cheaply."
00:28:55,00:28:58,"There was one in 1982 that came out, which"
00:28:58,00:29:01,was called Communist Mutants from Space.
00:29:01,00:29:04,This was obviously late Cold War.
00:29:04,00:29:07,And the way it worked was you were fighting against aliens
00:29:07,00:29:10,"from a Communist planet, which was called Ruski."
00:29:10,00:29:15,And it was amazing the Democrat planet.
00:29:15,00:29:19,And the aliens leader was a mother creature.
00:29:19,00:29:24,And she'd gone mad from drinking too much irradiated vodka.
00:29:24,00:29:27,How do they think of these things?
00:29:27,00:29:28,Wow.
00:29:28,00:29:30,"Hey, we need to move on, Shirley, to our next bag."
00:29:30,00:29:31,You know Second Life?
00:29:31,00:29:33,"Second Life, a big online thing."
00:29:33,00:29:36,"Second Life has support groups called things like,"
00:29:36,00:29:38,has Second Life taken over your life?
00:29:38,00:29:42,"Unfortunately, they take place inside Second Life."
00:29:42,00:29:43,"Oh, my God."
00:29:43,00:29:43,"Oh, wow."
00:29:43,00:29:45,So you have to be playing to take part?
00:29:45,00:29:46,That's so sad.
00:29:46,00:29:49,I just had a look at a couple of games that Vikings might play.
00:29:49,00:29:50,"Oh, cool, yeah."
00:29:50,00:29:53,So one game that they played in the longhouse
00:29:53,00:29:56,after their meal was called Haneutu Cast.
00:29:56,00:29:59,And their game was you threw bones at other players
00:29:59,00:30:01,with the intent of causing an injury.
00:30:01,00:30:08,And then you used their bones for the next game.
00:30:08,00:30:13,Can I throw a bone pretty hard to actually extract another bone?
00:30:13,00:30:17,"Is that where the phrase ""throw me a bone"" comes from?"
00:30:17,00:30:18,I shouldn't think so.
00:30:18,00:30:18,No.
00:30:18,00:30:23,"OK, sorry, no James, you got no?"
00:30:23,00:30:26,"Oh, just that another one is they had swimming competitions."
00:30:26,00:30:28,But the goal of their swimming competitions
00:30:28,00:30:30,was not who could get their quickest.
00:30:30,00:30:32,It was who could hold his opponent underwater for the longest.
00:30:36,00:30:40,That would be so much more exciting to watch.
00:30:40,00:30:43,"Just as an Olympic suggestion, too."
00:30:43,00:30:47,"All right, it's time to move on to our final fact of the show."
00:30:47,00:30:49,And that is James.
00:30:49,00:30:53,"OK, my fact this week is that Aussie Osborne's 1992"
00:30:53,00:30:56,TAR was called No Martos.
00:30:56,00:31:00,His 2018 TAR is called No Martos 2.
00:31:00,00:31:05,And has he confirmed how many in the series?
00:31:05,00:31:08,"Oh, I think he's going to go forever, isn't he?"
00:31:08,00:31:09,"Yeah, he's going to."
00:31:09,00:31:13,"In between, he did a retirement sucks, TAR."
00:31:13,00:31:14,"Wow, yeah."
00:31:14,00:31:16,But the No Martos was originally No Martias.
00:31:16,00:31:21,And then he was misdiagnosed now with multiple sclerosis.
00:31:21,00:31:24,And then he renamed it No Martos.
00:31:24,00:31:25,And he thought he would never TAR again.
00:31:25,00:31:27,But he is out there now.
00:31:27,00:31:31,"Yeah, I love-- I was looking into TAR names, generally,"
00:31:31,00:31:32,because they're all quite fun.
00:31:32,00:31:34,Sometimes bands do have some really good ones.
00:31:34,00:31:39,"Peter Gabriel of Genesis, he used to have a great one."
00:31:39,00:31:41,"So Peter Gabriel once had a TAR, which"
00:31:41,00:31:44,was called China 1984 TAR.
00:31:44,00:31:47,The interesting thing about this is that TAR took place
00:31:47,00:31:50,in Europe and the USA in 1980.
00:31:50,00:31:52,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:52,00:31:57,So it had no relevance whatsoever to China 1984 TAR.
00:31:57,00:31:59,"He also did playtime, 1988 TAR."
00:31:59,00:32:02,That took place in 1982.
00:32:02,00:32:05,"Yeah, he just thought-- he thought, ah, it doesn't matter."
00:32:05,00:32:08,Just any old shitty name's going to work.
00:32:08,00:32:11,"Elson John once had louder than a concord,"
00:32:11,00:32:12,"but not quite as pretty, which I think"
00:32:12,00:32:14,is a really nice name for a TAR.
00:32:14,00:32:14,Yeah.
00:32:14,00:32:17,"One direction once TAR'd under the name, take me home,"
00:32:17,00:32:18,which doesn't imply that they really
00:32:18,00:32:20,want to be there in the first place.
00:32:20,00:32:23,"Some 41 did a reunion tour, and they called it."
00:32:23,00:32:25,Don't call it a sum back tour.
00:32:25,00:32:27,Very--
00:32:27,00:32:31,"You were the consultant James on that tour, weren't you?"
00:32:31,00:32:34,Elson John first-- his first retirement tour
00:32:34,00:32:37,was announced in 1977.
00:32:37,00:32:40,And he is now doing his final retirement tour.
00:32:40,00:32:41,I think it's going to take him three years
00:32:41,00:32:42,to get all the way around the world.
00:32:42,00:32:43,Yeah.
00:32:43,00:32:46,"But Ozzy Osborne was a bit of a rocker, wasn't he?"
00:32:46,00:32:49,"Still is, I guess, although he doesn't drink any more."
00:32:49,00:32:51,And I think one of the reasons is because according
00:32:51,00:32:54,"to his autobiography, he was invited in 1981"
00:32:54,00:32:56,to a meeting with the head of CBS Europe.
00:32:56,00:32:58,And he decided to lighten the mood a bit
00:32:58,00:33:01,"by doing a strip tease on the table,"
00:33:01,00:33:05,and then kissing the record executive on the lips.
00:33:05,00:33:07,And Sharon later on told him that he'd actually
00:33:07,00:33:10,performed a Nazi goose step up and down on the table
00:33:10,00:33:13,before dipping his testicles into the executive's wine
00:33:13,00:33:15,and then urinating in it.
00:33:15,00:33:19,Wow.
00:33:19,00:33:20,He really-- he doesn't disappoint.
00:33:20,00:33:22,You think you're going to look up Ozzy Osborne
00:33:22,00:33:24,and find out he's not actually as mad as he seems.
00:33:24,00:33:27,"But my Lord, he--"
00:33:27,00:33:29,It's amazing.
00:33:29,00:33:31,He once got bored and he dragged a shark--
00:33:31,00:33:33,"don't know where he got the shark, no information on that--"
00:33:33,00:33:36,"dragged a shark into the hotel room, a dead shark,"
00:33:36,00:33:38,"threw the hotel room window, soaked in blood,"
00:33:38,00:33:41,and covered the hotel room in shark's blood.
00:33:41,00:33:42,What?
00:33:42,00:33:45,He did genuinely bite the head of two live doves
00:33:45,00:33:47,during a meeting with a PR manager.
00:33:47,00:33:50,So he'd meant to let them off at the end of the meeting.
00:33:50,00:33:52,But she says something that really irritated him.
00:33:52,00:33:55,"So instead of that, he took out two of his three"
00:33:55,00:33:56,live doves and bit the head.
00:33:56,00:33:57,Two of his three?
00:33:57,00:33:58,Yeah.
00:33:58,00:34:03,"No, what third one must have been absolutely terrifying?"
00:34:03,00:34:07,This magic actor's gone very sour.
00:34:07,00:34:10,"You know the tiny-- if you've seen spinal tap,"
00:34:10,00:34:11,you know they do a thing where they have to perform.
00:34:11,00:34:13,They get the dimensions wrong and they
00:34:13,00:34:15,"perform in front of this tiny stone hand, which is about--"
00:34:15,00:34:18,it's about 12 inches high and it's at a tall feet high.
00:34:18,00:34:21,So Black Sabbath went on tour in 1983.
00:34:21,00:34:23,"They had a replica of Stonehenge on stage,"
00:34:23,00:34:26,and it was so massive that it didn't fit on stage.
00:34:26,00:34:28,None of it could fit on stage.
00:34:28,00:34:29,So I think-- really?
00:34:29,00:34:30,I think they wanted it and they got it in a meter.
00:34:30,00:34:32,So I think that's where that comes from.
00:34:32,00:34:32,Wow.
00:34:32,00:34:33,"Yeah, that's so cool."
00:34:33,00:34:34,"That must have been onto that, yeah?"
00:34:34,00:34:38,"I really like the Aussie Osborne, obviously, famously."
00:34:38,00:34:41,"So the doves story, but the famous one is the bat story."
00:34:41,00:34:44,So he bit off a bat's head on stage.
00:34:44,00:34:47,"And the story goes that, in fact, he didn't know it was a bat."
00:34:47,00:34:50,"He thought it was a rubber bat that a fan had thrown on to stage,"
00:34:50,00:34:52,"picked it up, bit the head off, and then"
00:34:52,00:34:54,realized that it was an actual bat.
00:34:54,00:34:57,And that's the big story of Aussie Osborne
00:34:57,00:35:00,"from his, from his drunken drug days."
00:35:00,00:35:04,"But a few years back in 2010, he was trying to convert part"
00:35:04,00:35:06,of his Buckingham Shura state.
00:35:06,00:35:08,"But he couldn't, because it turned out"
00:35:08,00:35:11,"that he had bats in the loft, and there were protected species."
00:35:11,00:35:13,"So unless he promised to protect them,"
00:35:13,00:35:15,he wasn't able to do anything about it.
00:35:15,00:35:15,Wow.
00:35:15,00:35:17,"Yeah, so they finally got there."
00:35:17,00:35:21,"The idea was that, like you say, that's what happened."
00:35:21,00:35:23,"He said that-- sorry about this, but he said that as he"
00:35:23,00:35:26,"bit it off, he felt the head twitch in his mouth."
00:35:26,00:35:27,OK.
00:35:27,00:35:30,But according to the guy who claims that he was the one who
00:35:30,00:35:33,"threw it on stage called Mark Neal, he'd"
00:35:33,00:35:36,"found the bat two weeks earlier, and it was alive."
00:35:36,00:35:39,"But by the time he'd taken to it, it was long dead."
00:35:39,00:35:41,"And so he'd actually put a dead bat in his mouth,"
00:35:41,00:35:42,according to that guy.
00:35:42,00:35:43,Wow.
00:35:43,00:35:44,I don't know who to believe.
00:35:44,00:35:46,"I don't know, which is worse."
00:35:46,00:35:47,"No, they're both pretty awful."
00:35:47,00:35:48,"Yeah, they're both horrible."
00:35:48,00:35:49,Yeah.
00:35:49,00:35:52,So the drummer was called Bill Ward.
00:35:52,00:35:55,"And Tony Iomey, one of the other band members,"
00:35:55,00:35:56,was a known prankster.
00:35:56,00:35:59,But they particularly loved setting the drummer on fire.
00:35:59,00:36:02,"So apparently, they related a story of one show where Tony"
00:36:02,00:36:05,"said to Bill, I'd like to set you on fire now, please."
00:36:05,00:36:08,"And apparently, Bill said, I don't really"
00:36:08,00:36:09,"want you to, not now."
00:36:09,00:36:11,"And then at the end of the show, he came out to Tony and said,"
00:36:11,00:36:12,"OK, well, I have to go home in a minute."
00:36:12,00:36:15,So do you want to set me on fire or what?
00:36:15,00:36:16,He did.
00:36:16,00:36:18,"He sprayed him with lighter fluid, covered him"
00:36:18,00:36:20,"in lighter fluid, lit a match."
00:36:20,00:36:21,"And he was wearing polyester pants,"
00:36:21,00:36:23,and said that he went up extremely fast.
00:36:23,00:36:25,And he was on the floor screaming and crying.
00:36:25,00:36:27,"And Tony said, I couldn't help him,"
00:36:27,00:36:31,because I was so busy laughing.
00:36:31,00:36:33,It actually turned out to be quite serious.
00:36:33,00:36:34,And I felt very bad for him yet.
00:36:34,00:36:36,And ambulance was called.
00:36:36,00:36:38,"And again, in 1980, he got third degree burns,"
00:36:38,00:36:41,because they set fire to him again.
00:36:41,00:36:43,He just kept on volunteering for this.
00:36:43,00:36:44,Wow.
00:36:44,00:36:47,"Well, he's actually-- he's one of the few people on Earth"
00:36:47,00:36:50,who's had his entire DNA sequenced for some years.
00:36:50,00:36:51,He's one of the ones you mean?
00:36:51,00:36:52,"Sorry, Ozzy Osborne, yeah."
00:36:52,00:36:56,He's one of the few people who's had his DNA sequenced.
00:36:56,00:36:59,So James Watson had his-- a few others.
00:36:59,00:37:01,And he was done by a scientist who wanted to work out
00:37:01,00:37:03,"how the hell he's still alive, basically."
00:37:03,00:37:05,"They were like, does he have a special gene?"
00:37:05,00:37:07,Does he have anything?
00:37:07,00:37:09,And he does have a few oddities within his body.
00:37:09,00:37:11,Nothing major.
00:37:11,00:37:14,He's got a bit of neanderthal in him as well.
00:37:14,00:37:15,"Oh, but we all do, don't we?"
00:37:15,00:37:16,Yeah.
00:37:16,00:37:18,But he's probably got a bit more than most.
00:37:18,00:37:22,"Yeah, he's up to like 70%."
00:37:22,00:37:23,"No, we all have like two or three percent, don't we?"
00:37:23,00:37:26,But they found that he had a little bit more than most.
00:37:26,00:37:27,Yeah.
00:37:27,00:37:31,"But yeah, so he had a few bits that could process alcohol"
00:37:31,00:37:32,a bit more addictively.
00:37:32,00:37:33,And that's why it made him an addict.
00:37:33,00:37:36,So they did learn a lot from doing it.
00:37:36,00:37:39,They said he was 2.6 times more likely to hallucinate
00:37:39,00:37:40,on marijuana.
00:37:40,00:37:43,He had an increased risk of cocaine addiction.
00:37:43,00:37:44,He was six times more likely than average
00:37:44,00:37:46,to be alcohol dependent.
00:37:46,00:37:49,"But weirdly, the person who conducted the test said,"
00:37:49,00:37:52,"Aussie Aussie wants kryptonite is caffeine, which is bizarre,"
00:37:52,00:37:54,because he's taken every single drug under the sun.
00:37:54,00:37:57,"But apparently, yeah, he's extremely slow to metabolize"
00:37:57,00:37:58,coffee.
00:37:58,00:38:01,"So if you think he's a bit of a mess right now,"
00:38:01,00:38:03,it's just because of the coffee thing.
00:38:03,00:38:06,That's massive.
00:38:06,00:38:09,"That kind of explains one thing I've got here, which"
00:38:09,00:38:12,is that he keeps failing driving tests.
00:38:12,00:38:15,"And one time, he fell asleep during the test."
00:38:15,00:38:17,"That's a major, isn't it?"
00:38:17,00:38:19,"Yeah, that's a major."
00:38:19,00:38:22,"I think June's a lack of caffeine, maybe, I don't know."
00:38:22,00:38:25,"He said, when I woke up, there was a note on the seat saying,"
00:38:25,00:38:25,you have failed.
00:38:25,00:38:32,"And yet, the examiner left him the car."
00:38:32,00:38:35,Yeah.
00:38:35,00:38:37,Do you want to hear the least rock and roll story I've ever
00:38:37,00:38:40,heard that was a piece of the Guardian about the worst gigs ever?
00:38:40,00:38:41,It was very funny.
00:38:41,00:38:43,And it was the Jonas Brothers.
00:38:43,00:38:45,"Yeah, they started off as a Christian rock band,"
00:38:45,00:38:46,"I think, maybe they still are."
00:38:46,00:38:50,"But Joe Jonas said, we played a strawberry festival where"
00:38:50,00:38:52,they actually judge strawberries with taste test and everything.
00:38:52,00:38:55,It was the most awkward gig we've ever done.
00:38:55,00:38:56,There was hardly anyone there.
00:38:56,00:38:58,And the sound cut out halfway through.
00:38:58,00:39:00,We had to perform without any sound equipment.
00:39:00,00:39:01,These poor kids.
00:39:01,00:39:04,"They said, we didn't get angry and smash the place up."
00:39:04,00:39:06,But we did get asked to judge the winning strawberry
00:39:06,00:39:09,as compensation for the bad sound.
00:39:09,00:39:11,The winning strawberry was fantastic.
00:39:11,00:39:14,Oh.
00:39:14,00:39:15,I thought they would have deliberately
00:39:15,00:39:17,given it to a really shit strawberry.
00:39:17,00:39:17,No.
00:39:17,00:39:19,What's a raspberry or something?
00:39:19,00:39:21,They're nice boys.
00:39:21,00:39:23,"Sorry, I just wanted to count about it."
00:39:23,00:39:27,"Biting their head off two dubs, but leaving the third terrified one."
00:39:27,00:39:32,I've got a good first time to count from someone we know.
00:39:32,00:39:33,Rock and roll account.
00:39:33,00:39:37,So Freddie Mercury used to have parties.
00:39:37,00:39:39,"And obviously, he was a wild child."
00:39:39,00:39:44,And he had parties and he used to invite small people or dwarves
00:39:44,00:39:48,to the parties and put bowls on the heads full of cocaine
00:39:48,00:39:50,so they could be easily consumed.
00:39:50,00:39:53,Which of our friends was at this party?
00:39:53,00:39:56,"I don't like to say, but this same friend did say he also"
00:39:56,00:39:57,toured with black Sabbath.
00:39:57,00:40:00,And because the done thing is to throw a TV out the window.
00:40:00,00:40:02,You've got to throw a TV out the window at some point.
00:40:02,00:40:04,So I think actually one member of black Sabbath
00:40:04,00:40:06,was on the way to the airport once and stopped the driver
00:40:06,00:40:07,"and said, got turned around."
00:40:07,00:40:09,I've forgotten something and got driven back.
00:40:09,00:40:12,"Ran upstairs, brought the TV downstairs and threw it"
00:40:12,00:40:13,in the swimming pool of the hotel.
00:40:13,00:40:16,"Then got back in the cabin and said, OK, thank God."
00:40:16,00:40:19,"Right, we better go to the airport."
00:40:19,00:40:22,But this guy that we know did also tour black Sabbath
00:40:22,00:40:24,and decided he had to throw a TV out of the hotel window.
00:40:24,00:40:25,But forgot to one plug it.
00:40:25,00:40:29,So apparently ended up with the TV just dangling precariously.
00:40:29,00:40:32,From the 24th of a hotel.
00:40:32,00:40:34,Do you know what one of the main rules that are rolling stones?
00:40:34,00:40:38,Gig is these days for the band.
00:40:38,00:40:39,I don't know.
00:40:39,00:40:43,You're not allowed to touch Keith Richards' shepherd's pie.
00:40:43,00:40:45,And there's that. Are you for this one for something though?
00:40:45,00:40:46,"No, no."
00:40:46,00:40:48,He's completely clean these days.
00:40:48,00:40:51,And he has a shepherd's pie before every gig.
00:40:51,00:40:54,"And in 1989 in Toronto, he found that someone had tried it"
00:40:54,00:40:56,"before him, and he refused to go on stage"
00:40:56,00:41:00,until a new shepherd's pie was made and brought to him.
00:41:00,00:41:01,"He said, nobody touches the shepherd's pie"
00:41:01,00:41:02,till I've been in there.
00:41:02,00:41:04,"Don't bust my crust, baby."
00:41:08,00:41:09,He didn't say that.
00:41:09,00:41:10,He said it.
00:41:10,00:41:12,The mom's a great lyricist.
00:41:12,00:41:13,That's amazing.
00:41:13,00:41:15,We're going to have to wrap up shortly.
00:41:15,00:41:16,Anything before we do?
00:41:16,00:41:20,"Just quickly, I've got one, which is that just on tours,"
00:41:20,00:41:24,"recent tours, Beyonce had a thing a few years ago where she's in."
00:41:24,00:41:31,"No, she had this whole thing where she really enraged a lot"
00:41:31,00:41:33,of people from comments that she had made.
00:41:33,00:41:36,And critics were really attacking her.
00:41:36,00:41:38,The newspapers were attacking her.
00:41:38,00:41:40,But she was still going on this tour.
00:41:40,00:41:43,So she decided to sell as part of her merchandise.
00:41:43,00:41:45,merchandise.
00:41:45,00:41:47,You want some merchandise?
00:41:47,00:41:49,It was a new Jersey tour.
00:41:49,00:41:50,I'm not merchandise.
00:41:50,00:41:57,So weird when your mouth just goes somewhere else.
00:41:57,00:41:59,"You're on the road, and it's just merchandise."
00:41:59,00:42:02,Whoa!
00:42:02,00:42:07,"She sold, as merchandise, boycott Beyonce t-shirts"
00:42:07,00:42:08,"to cash in on the fact she was like,"
00:42:08,00:42:09,"""Of people are going to hate me."
00:42:09,00:42:11,"Sure, I'll just keep selling stuff."
00:42:11,00:42:13,It will just still generate funds.
00:42:13,00:42:16,"Yeah, so you could buy at her gig, boycott Beyonce t-shirts."""
00:42:16,00:42:17,Really?
00:42:17,00:42:20,What's the other thing about Elvis' manager did that as well?
00:42:20,00:42:25,"Yeah, Elvis' manager sold, I hate Elvis t-shirts, I think,"
00:42:25,00:42:27,or an I hate Elvis piece of merchandise
00:42:27,00:42:29,to make sure he could also cash in on the people
00:42:29,00:42:31,who weren't huge Elvis fans.
00:42:31,00:42:32,What else do you want to do?
00:42:32,00:42:34,Can I very quickly tell you a few?
00:42:34,00:42:36,I just looked up a few tribute bands who tour.
00:42:36,00:42:38,And just the names tribute bands have other best things
00:42:38,00:42:39,in the world.
00:42:39,00:42:42,So there's the Red Not Chili Peppers.
00:42:42,00:42:43,There's an Alanis Morissette tribute band
00:42:43,00:42:46,"called Alanish, but it just sounds"
00:42:46,00:42:47,like they're a bit like someone called Alan.
00:42:47,00:42:53,"But there's a tribute band to yes, who are called no."
00:42:53,00:42:59,"There's non-Jovie, earth wind for hire, earth wind of fire,"
00:42:59,00:43:00,proxy music.
00:43:00,00:43:03,"And my favourite is a rather poorly gentlemen,"
00:43:03,00:43:07,"but he goes by the name, ""Blobby Williams."""
00:43:07,00:43:11,"OK, that is it."
