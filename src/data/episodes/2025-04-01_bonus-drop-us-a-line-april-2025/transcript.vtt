00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960
 (upbeat music)

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.160
 Hey, Club Fish members, how you doing?

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.000
 It's Dan here.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 Hope you're well.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.680
 Welcome to your bonus bit of content.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.760
 This is a compilation episode that we have for you today,

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.520
 all the best bits that didn't make it into the main episode,

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.200
 largely 'cause they just didn't fit the narrative.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.520
 So, hope you enjoy it.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.640
 But before we get to it, just a quick reminder,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.240

 we're gonna be there doing fish live

 at the Crossed Wires Festival.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.920
 Alice Levine put together this awesome podcast festival.

 Okay, that's it.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.800
 Let's get to the main episode now.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.640
 Here we go.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.560
 The best of the bits that didn't make it on with the show.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.260
 (upbeat music)

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:14.640
 - Hi, everybody, Andy here.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.960
 Welcome to an audience fact special episode

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.240
 of No Such Thing as a Fish.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.200
 You have all been sending your facts to podcast@qi.com.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.680
 Is that the address?

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.520
 - That's the address.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.040
 That's what I say every week, so I hope so.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.200
 - Well, they've been getting through,

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.560
 and they've been coming in thick and fast.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.160
 And we've creamed off the ones on the top,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.440
 and we're gonna be reading them out

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.400
 and sharing them back with you now.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.720
 - It's harder than it looks, isn't it, Andy?

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.720
 - It's a very difficult job.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.080
 Damn, this is amazing.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.920
 (laughing)

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.760
 - I'm happy to be here.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.240
 Do you wanna mention who else is here?

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.360
 (laughing)

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.680
 - Where are we as well?

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.440
 And how often does this podcast go out?

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.960
 - God.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.280
 - Can I tell you one last thing about the boss for us?

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.120
 - Yeah.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.000
 - Constantinople and how it was defended.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.560
 There's one weakness in a naval sense.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.120
 There's a waterway which is calm and navigable.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.680
 And basically, if you could sail your ships in there.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.740
 - Oh, like a harbour.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:05.960
 - Yeah, you could invade,

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.640
 and it would be incredibly easy to invade.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.880
 So how did Constantinople, as it was then,

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:10.800
 solve this problem?

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.120
 - Cannons.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.600
 - Great idea.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.600
 Arguably better than what they came up with.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.080
 (laughing)

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.000
 - Crocodiles.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.200
 - Crocodiles, good call.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.040
 - That's good.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.760
 - So I was going to tell you about the chain of the Golden Horn.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.600
 - Okay.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.480
 - They had a massive chain just across the water.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.320
 - Yeah.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.680
 - Like a rope barrier outside a nightclub.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.680
 - I thought didn't this work though?

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.120
 - Actually, I'm being unfair.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.440
 It worked better than you'd think it would.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.880
 It's about half a mile long.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.720
 - Okay.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.560
 - Just this huge chain across the water,

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.800
 and then they can lower it

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.880
 if someone approaches who's friendly.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.720
 And then what?

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.560
 Joink it up again.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.720
 - They were quite common, those things, I think.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.560
 - Okay.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.280
 - Yeah, I've heard of them before.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.280
 I heard of one.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.920
 This is in like British history,

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.320
 but there was one of them somewhere

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.280
 where someone was in a boat

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.280
 and they went in the boat towards this chain

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.240
 and they're going to hit it.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.200
 And what happened was everyone on the boat

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.400
 ran to the back of the boat,

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.480
 so it lifted the front of it.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.320
 So they went over it

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.000
 and then everyone ran to the front.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.960
 - Surely not.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.360
 That was like a heralded to story if I ever heard one.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.640
 - I think it is a story,

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.600
 like I remember where it's from.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.440
 - It's good.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.280
 - That's great.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.160
 - There was a report in Scientific American in 1858

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.640
 about a healthy person called Mr. Gru,

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.840
 but he was born without a sternum or a breastbone.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.800
 And so you could see completely clearly his heart

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.360
 and part of his lungs.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.920
 So it was just a thin layer of skin around it.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.600
 And so he'd be exhibited in theaters around Europe

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.960
 for a few years and in lecture halls

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.680
 because it really helped doctors know

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.800
 about the structure of the heart and how it beat

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.120
 'cause he'd literally stand at the front of a lecture hall

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.440
 and you'd be sitting at the back

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.520
 and you could see his heart boom-bombing

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.560
 and bouncing out of his chest.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.520
 - 'Cause he didn't grew properly.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.920
 He was just--

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:52.760
 - Wow, good stuff.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:53.600
 Yeah.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.680
 - It wasn't Gru the name of the guy from Despicable Me.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.520
 - Yeah, yes.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.720
 - And so did he have this?

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.320
 And then he thought he was so exceptional

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.560
 that he decided to take over the world with his minions.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.680
 - And that's what that's based on.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.520
 - Yes.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.360
 - There we go.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.200
 - What kind of full circle?

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.040
 - Did he have ribs?

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.200
 And if so, where did they meet?

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.040
 - I think maybe the ribs didn't meet.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.040
 No breastbone.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.360
 - It feels like they wouldn't meet.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.200
 - Yeah.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.040
 - They just sort of stop.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.880
 - Big hole.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:16.720
 - It just floats.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.560
 That feels very painful.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.800
 - There are muscles between your ribs.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.320
 So it would stay in place.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.320
 - Right.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.280
 - It wouldn't be good to like,

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.160
 my daughter likes to jump on my chest.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.000
 That wouldn't be great.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.840
 - Oh.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:26.680
 - You have to just limit that.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:27.500
 - Yeah.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.880
 - And if he coughed or sneezed,

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.880
 then his lung really bounced out of his chest.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.440
 You really see it as long.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.000
 - And if he really fancied someone like Jessica Rabbit,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 walking past his heart really pumped out of his chest.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.320
 - There was actually a really sad study

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.280
 about which bits of their lives people would skip.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.000
 Like if they could say skip ahead five minutes

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.840
 for about 10 minutes.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.920
 I've found that people would skip a huge proportion of it.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.780
 Obviously, 'cause most of your life is just drudgery.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.120
 Like if we could skip to the end of this guys,

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.000
 we wouldn't, wouldn't we?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.360
 - Well, people listening could just fast forward to the answer.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.360
 - If only we could.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.640
 - Accessory breasts.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.480
 That's another thing.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.320
 - Accessory.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.160
 - Okay.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.640
 So you know the classic total recall three boobed lady,

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.440
 three boobs is a thing.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.800
 But like Andy's saying,

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.240
 you might not know where to find it.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.880
 So it's quite possible that you have three lactating breasts.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.040
 But in the image that I saw,

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.040
 which to be fair was a drawing,

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.120
 a lady was breastfeeding her child

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.080
 and then thigh feeding her other child

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.160
 because the breast had criss.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.480
 - Was this something real?

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.320
 - Yeah.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.960
 - This isn't from one of your manga.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.560
 (all laughing)

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.760
 - That's collection of erotic manga

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.040
 is unparalleled in this hemisphere.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.880
 - Saint Jerome was a famous translator.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:44.720
 - Really?

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.440
 - Not through like audio.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.200
 He would translate the Bible into the Vulgate.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.120
 And what he did was he took the sort of Hebrew Bible

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.920
 and then he put it into Latin,

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.080
 but he'd put it into a way that everyone could understand.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.800
 So he put, he changed some of the words

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:00.880
 that maybe he shouldn't have done.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.880
 So there was a, in fact, a Greek word, which was Maschia,

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.320
 which meant like Messiah.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.440
 And he changed it to Christos,

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.800
 meaning anointed.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.160
 But actually the more reasonable way of translating that

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.200
 would be unctus, meaning anointed.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.840
 And that is why we call Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ,

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.400
 because of that translation.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.240
 - Oh, wow.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.760
 So we should call him unctus.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:25.600
 - Jesus unct.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.440
 - Jesus unct.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.280
 Yeah.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.600
 Unctiano Ronaldo.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.440
 - What's that doing?

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:30.760
 - It should be like,

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.920
 anyone called Christian or anything like that

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.080
 should be unctiano, really.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.920
 - That's so funny.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.280
 - He is quite an oily man.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.360
 - Well, exactly.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.720
 - But isn't it amazing like one little bit of translation

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.600
 can change so much in history?

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.400
 - That's where we get Christopher from as well, isn't it?

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.640
 - Yeah, Christian and everything.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.920
 - No, unctophosan, for example.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.160
 (both laughing)

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.240
 - Unctophosan.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.560
 - The only thing I know about Saint Jerome

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.600
 is that he apparently told,

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.160
 I think this is in the realms of maybe true,

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.000
 maybe not be true.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.600
 He told nuns not to eat beans

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.000
 because he thought the flatulence that they would produce

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.960
 is so close to their front, bottom,

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.440
 that they might induce orgasms accidentally

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.920
 off the tickling sensation of the fart.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:18.320
 So he said, "Tony beans, nuns."

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.400
 And he went back to translating the Bible.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.680
 (both laughing)

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.920
 - There's a story told by John Sessions on QI

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.880
 in one of the early series that you guys might remember

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.520
 which I always love.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.600
 And I actually don't know,

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.440
 I think his source would have been,

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.480
 he's been told by someone else

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.880
 who was told by Gandhi himself, probably.

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:35.800
 That's what I'm assuming.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.080
 But basically in the scene,

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.280
 so there are 300,000 extras, as you say,

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.200
 and Richard Attenborough's the director.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.320
 And the person who's organizing all the extras

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.680
 in the whole scene is this other guy called David Tomlin

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.960
 who's overseeing this funeral scene.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.720
 So Gandhi's just died and Attenborough says to Tomlin,

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.440
 "You've got to tell these 300,000 extras

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.840
 how they're gonna behave."

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.720
 And Gandhi's just died, the hero,

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.800
 like the ultimate icon of their country.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.640
 This is the worst news they've ever heard.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.720
 They're devastated, their lives have fallen apart

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.840
 before their very eyes.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.040
 Can you possibly convey to them how they have to act?

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.960
 So David Tomlin just turned around to this crowd

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.360
 and said, "Right, listen up, Gandhi's dead

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.800
 and you're all fucking sad."

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.240
 (both laughing)

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.080
 - Wow.

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:21.920
 - Yeah, it works.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.200
 - That's very good.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.240
 - So there are three bridges now,

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.600
 I think spanning the Bosphorus

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.200
 and built at various different times.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:32.240
 But the 1973 one, the first one was the Game Changer.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:36.480
 In 1960s, you had to wait two and a half hours to cross,

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.280
 I think by car, but it was just so clogged.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.680
 And then for vans and lorries,

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:43.320
 it was days you had to wait to cross by boat

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.600
 before the bridges happened.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.760
 - Oh yeah.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.000
 - And I listened to this amazing interview with Harvey Binney,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.600
 who's one of the architects, British guy.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.760
 He's retired now obviously, because it was a long time ago.

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.080
 And he was interviewed by the BBC

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.520
 and here's a good riddle, me this.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:57.440
 - Oh, hey, go on.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:01.760
 - The distance between the tops of the two towers,

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.160
 'cause it's a suspension bridge.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.240
 It's got two towers spanning the middle of it,

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.520
 is different at the top and at the bottom.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.080
 Riddle me this, the...

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.440
 - Sorry, so as in you take the top

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.400
 and then you go straight down that pole to the bottom.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.640
 - But those towers are not straight.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:16.880
 - Well, they are straight.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:17.720
 - Oh.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:18.560
 - Or is it the curvature of the earth?

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.440
 - The earth is not straight.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.520
 - That was right, what I said.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.520
 - Yeah.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.960
 - Because they had to build both towers absolutely straight,

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.240
 but it's such a distance apart

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.440
 that if you build them both straight,

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.120
 the curvature of the earth comes into play.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.080
 And it's about 10 centimetres different at the top.

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:32.920
 - Who's it?

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.640
 - And he said, look, we did have to take that into account

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.160
 because you don't want to end up with like 10 centimetres.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.040
 You don't want to miss 10 centimetres of cable.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.600
 - It's long, but it's not that long.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.640
 - The earth doesn't feel that curved, does it?

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:46.000
 - I know, the earth is more curved than you'd think.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.640
 - The earth is a lot more curved than dad thinks.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:49.480
 - Hell yeah.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:52.000
 (all laughing)

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.560
 - Only joking, I'll need that.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.480
 - We're just constantly losing giant containers

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.520
 off the back of sherps.

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:58.360
 - Why don't they pick it?

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.320
 - You'd want to fish them out and see what's in each one.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.160
 - You would, right?

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.000
 - It could be a container of baked beans,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.200
 a container of Barbies.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.600
 - That is a fun format for a TV show.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.560
 - How does it work, sorry?

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.600
 - They already do this.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.000
 - Well, it's a team of celebrities.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.320
 - But there is one of these that exists,

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:14.440
 but it's on land, right?

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.680
 Where you go into containers and you open them much.

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:17.840
 - That's it, it's an American show.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.520
 And you get like, you take an old container unit

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.320
 that's not been claimed.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.160
 Or it's like--

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.720
 - It's run out, they've paid their rent.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.280
 - Yeah, that doesn't download for this show.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:27.000
 - And a load of experts can look inside,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.720
 but they can't go in, they can't open anything up.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.480
 So you just have to bid an amount for it

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.960
 based on what you think might be in there.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.600
 - Yeah, what is it called, you've told me.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.600
 - Nothing wrong with liking a really good show, you know?

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:37.440
 - It's called Storage Wars.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.280
 - Storage Wars.

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.320
 - Can I just say if the producers of Storage Wars

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.040
 are listening and they want a celebrity to come on,

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.160
 then Dan is available.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.200
 - I am available.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.240
 - It's more outlandish, isn't it?

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.800
 I'll send you in this little rowing boat

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.200
 to the middle of Pacific Ocean to find a container.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.480
 - The thing about heartbeats is

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.320
 some people can hear their own heartbeats

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:59.920
 better than others, and this is called entereception.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.520
 And it's the ability to interpret signals

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.320
 from inside your body, so.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.040
 - I'm so hoping you don't say this means

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.040
 they're gonna die prematurely

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.560
 because I hear my heartbeats so loudly all the time.

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:13.000
 - You're more likely to report having anxiety

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.240
 if you do that, and you're more likely to,

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.440
 if your heartbeat changes slightly,

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:20.960
 to think it's something to be worried about,

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.720
 whereas actually normally people's heartbeats

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.320
 do change quite a lot throughout the course of a day.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.080
 And actually the best thing is to have a medium.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.800
 You wanna sometimes hear it a little bit,

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.240
 but not be obsessed with it, basically.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:36.000
 - So are you concerned about it sometimes, Anna?

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.160
 - No, I don't get concerned.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.000
 I just, it keeps me awake.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.240
 Sometimes 'cause you lie down on your pillow,

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.240
 you can always hear it in your ear.

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.800
 - So do you, yeah, do you hear it internally

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.520
 or can you hear it outwardly?

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:44.360
 - Hear it out?

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.120
 What, like, hear it before you get to my shirt?

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.200
 - Yeah, can you, no.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.400
 That's physically, I mean, can you hear the noise?

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.600
 - You're not a cartoon character, Anna.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.400
 Could your husband hear the noise

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.080
 or is it through your inner ear?

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.320
 - I've never asked him, but I snore so loudly

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:59.480
 that I think it would cover up any noise I'm making.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.640
 - You're like the Telltale Heart by Edgar Ellingham.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:02.480
 - Oh, yeah.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.960
 - You're like that your whole life.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:04.960
 - I am.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.280
 Hang on, what does the heart tell?

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.120
 It beats and it tells someone.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.280
 - He's murdered someone.

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:10.080
 - He's murdered the old man.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:10.920
 Oh, it happens right away.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:13.520
 It's sort of straight away, he kills the old man

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.240
 'cause he's got this weird eye.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.080
 The old man has a weird eye.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.800
 The guy hates that this old man has this weird eye

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:18.960
 and he gets obsessed with it

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.920
 and he decides, "Oh, am I gonna have to kill the old man?"

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:22.800
 I mean, I think I just live in the same building

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.640
 or something, it's always his landlord or something.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:28.280
 But he kills him and then he keeps hearing it.

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.720
 He buries it under the floorboards

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.120
 and he keeps hearing his heartbeat.

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.680
 And some people come around to investigate.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.120
 We've heard there's been an old man murdered.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.960
 Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.080
 He's like, "Can you not hear that?"

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:37.920
 - No one else can hear it.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.200
 - Like, "No, no, Hannah's in the car now."

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.320
 (all laughing)

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.800
 - I was actually looking up.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.000
 'Cause I was thinking I like eel in Japanese restaurants,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.800
 which is the only context I've really had it,

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.720
 but obviously it used to be a huge thing.

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.600
 You'd mostly in London and Cockneys

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.960
 and everyone ate Jelly Deal, right?

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:54.600
 You'd have pie mash and eel shops or whatever.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:55.440
 - That's right.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.040
 - And I was wondering, was it nice?

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:01.000
 And honestly, I've been through so many forums

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.920
 where people were reminiscing about eating it

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:06.080
 and not a single person has said it wasn't disgusting.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.600
 - And presumably if you're posting on those forums,

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.200
 you're a kind of nostalgia called buffer.

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.040
 - Exactly.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.040
 - Like that I would think is the prime territory.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:13.880
 - You're desperate to say,

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:16.040
 "Oh, it was better in the good old days."

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.920
 And they all just had to know it was rank.

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:22.360
 I thought after Brexit, I thought we're gonna get it back.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.200
 - Did you?

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.240
 - I thought, yeah, that was the sunlit uplands

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.580
 that I was looking for.

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:27.400
 - That's what you voted for, wasn't it?

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:28.680
 - Bring back the Jelly Deals.

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.040
 - No, actually, Brexit has stuffed the eel thing.

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:31.880
 - Oh no.

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:33.240
 - I'm so sorry, it has.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.320
 - Wasted boat jams.

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.600
 - I'm sure you guys are familiar

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.280
 with the Sustainable Eel Group.

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:41.400
 Basically, we used to ship 10 million eels a year to Europe.

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.160
 Legally, this isn't trafficked.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.400
 And more than half of that was for rewilding.

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.160
 'Cause if you get an eel swimming into the seven asteroid,

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.080
 it's screwed, right?

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.400
 It's like, it can't get up the seven asteroid tour

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.600
 but it's spawning ground.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:52.840
 The river is too blocked up.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:54.560
 But there are loads of places in Europe

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.760
 where you can introduce Neil, it'll swim up,

00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:59.160
 it'll find a cracking place to spawn, whatever.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.240
 And you've done a great job there.

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:03.040
 But Brexit has ruined it, so.

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.840
 - 'Cause they can't fill in the paperwork and stuff.

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:05.800
 - It's okay.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.280
 Yeah, they can't fill in the paperwork.

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.120
 'Cause it basically trade barriers.

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.640
 - Yeah, it's a bit of a pain.

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.200
 - Does your heart really go bum-bum-bum?

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.160
 Does it just go bum and you've just heard

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:16.520
 the bum-bum in movies?

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:17.360
 Or is it an echo?

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.360
 Is the bum-bum-bum?

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.680
 - If you've got a very hollow body.

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:22.520
 - Yeah.

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:23.360
 - For a hollow head.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.480
 - I'm just testing now.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:25.800
 - It does go bum-bum sometimes.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.520
 I might be too very hard, I think.

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:28.520
 - I can only hear the,

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:29.680
 the moment I can only hear the bum.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:30.840
 - Yeah.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.800
 - Well, you'll be using your pulse.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:33.640
 - Yeah.

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:34.480
 - You're not listening to your.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:35.480
 - But it's like, for instance, if you listen.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.520
 - Wait, what do you think the heart is?

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.200
 - Well, I think the heart,

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.680
 the bum-bum I associate with heart, not with my pulse.

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.680
 I know that you can feel the pulse.

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.120
 But you can't say, oh, I can hear my heart

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.080
 by touching your veins on your wrist.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:47.920
 - Yeah.

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:48.760
 - Okay, hang on.

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:49.600
 - This has all got a bit stoner,

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.080
 but go on, James, bring it back.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.200
 - Well, I doubt I will.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.800
 But it's like with a clock.

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.800
 You know, a clock ticks, but it doesn't talk.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.880
 It just goes tick, tick, tick.

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.080
 'Cause it's the same mechanism doing it all the time.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.960
 But if you listen to it, you can almost hear a talk,

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:04.920
 even though there's not one there

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:05.960
 because you're expecting it.

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.320
 - I was playing it cool by agreeing with you,

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:09.160
 but I absolutely thought there was a talk.

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:10.480
 (laughing)

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.480
 - I thought in every clock,

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.200
 they'd entered two different tones just before.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.960
 - I thought the pendulum, yeah,

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.440
 I assumed for years and years and years.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:17.440
 When the pendulum goes one way,

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:18.320
 that makes a tick sound.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.440
 And then, I don't know, inside the glass cabinet,

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.840
 there's something which makes it sound

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:24.080
 a bit different going the other way.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.560
 - It's weird that you've still got that pendulum watch.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.320
 - There is a different kind of eel,

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.720
 which does a similar-ish thing.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:31.160
 It's called a snake eel.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:35.440
 And they have a very pointy tip on their tail.

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.160
 And they use it in a slightly different way.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.240
 They use it just to power out of the stomach of the fish,

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.920
 which is eaten them sideways.

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.600
 And then they just go out of the stomach.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:44.800
 - Oh, like pierce it.

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.280
 - They just pierce it, they just go through.

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.520
 - Well, that sounds not very good for the fish.

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:48.440
 - Well, it's not good for anyone

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:49.800
 'cause they can't get through the rib cage

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.480
 once they're through the stomach.

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.280
 So they just end up stuck in there.

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:55.480
 - That's like a blooper from the alien movies.

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.160
 (laughing)

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:00.920
 The alien's like, "I'm stuck, we're gonna have to do this again."

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:02.880
 - Yeah, and the fish doesn't even notice.

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:06.160
 Fish can cope with a lot of stuff.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.480
 - Something piercing a big hole in its stomach

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.520
 and then landing up squirming around in its rib cage.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:12.000
 I don't know whether they don't notice,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.720
 but they definitely don't take any action.

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:15.560
 - They play it cool.

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:16.400
 - They play it cool, yeah.

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:17.240
 - Good on 'em.

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:20.280
 - You know, if you eat mussels as a human,

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.200
 you put them in the pot and it's boiling water.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.120
 - Oh, yes, and they often come back out, don't they?

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.680
 Quite soon afterwards.

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.240
 - But you're not supposed to eat the closed ones

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.600
 'cause they might come out.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:29.600
 Well, that is actually true.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:33.320
 If you see an enemy, if you eat a mussel and it's closed,

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.120
 then the mussel can just go through your body

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.120
 and come out the other end

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.920
 and the mussel will still be fine.

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:38.760
 - Oh, really?

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:39.600
 - Yeah.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.160
 - Whereas normally what they'll do is

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.520
 they'll bring in the mussel and the shell

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:45.600
 and then they'll eat the mussel and eject the shell,

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.600
 but if it's closed, they can't get us the mussel.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.920
 - Do the enemies, anemones, eat the whole thing

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:52.640
 and then just sort it out inside?

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:53.480
 - Yes, they do.

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:54.920
 - 'Cause that's a more dignified way of eating, I think.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:55.760
 - Yeah.

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.120
 - Now, if you could do that with a lobster.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.880
 - If you could do that with a Big Mac

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.440
 and you put in the entire, the burger

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:04.640
 and the bit of plastic that comes, that goes around it.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:05.640
 - With the plastic on the cheese.

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.080
 - Or if you could, yeah.

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:08.640
 (laughing)

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:11.200
 Or if you could do it with a Kinder Egg

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.440
 and then you could eat the whole thing

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.560
 and you could even make the tie inside you.

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:15.400
 - I love that.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.240
 (laughing)

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.080
 Just open your mouth.

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:18.880
 There's a little mechanical wiggle on there.

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:24.000
 50% of eel consumed on the planet is eaten in Japan.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:24.840
 - It's big.

00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:25.960
 - And if you go to a Japanese restaurant,

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.600
 they'll always have, they have eel on the menu.

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:32.040
 But the nice news is that 35% of Japanese people

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.840
 are willing to eat cultured eel.

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:34.680
 - As in--

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:35.520
 - What eel that goes to the theater?

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:36.360
 - That's right.

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:37.200
 (laughing)

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.120
 It costs more because obviously you've seen

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:40.200
 the prices of the restaurant these days, all right.

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:42.400
 (laughing)

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.800
 No, you can, it's saffron-lay-miz.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:45.640
 (laughing)

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:46.480
 It liked Hamilton.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.320
 It didn't love it.

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:48.880
 Like, it wasn't five stars.

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:52.280
 But no, it's like, you can grow really good eel now.

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.960
 You know, the art of it, like growing meats

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.440
 which are of different varieties.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.240
 The eel you can get now is really realistic.

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:58.160
 - We're at like fake eel.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.000
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:17:59.840
 - Oh, wow, really?

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:01.760
 - It looks like it, it tastes like it, all of that, you know.

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.040
 So that might be quite good.

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.200
 - And how many Japanese people are willing to eat that?

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:06.040
 - Over a third.

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:07.320
 - That's good figures.

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.200
 That's much better than like proportions of American people

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.880
 who would be willing to eat fake meat.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:11.840
 I suspect culture meat.

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:14.360
 - Yeah, but we all say we're willing to eat kangaroo testicles

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:15.200
 until we're actually on.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.760
 I'm a celebrity to get me out of here.

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:17.600
 (laughing)

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:21.360
 And then you don't want to, you're right, you're right.

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:24.760
 - Alfred Hitchcock was terrified of eggs, had ovo-phobia.

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:28.240
 So he said the white round thing without any holes.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.800
 That's how he referred to eggs.

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.720
 And when you break it inside,

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:35.320
 there's that yellow thing round without any holes.

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:38.760
 So I think he likes holes and he doesn't like eggs.

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:40.240
 - Did he like ping pong balls?

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.080
 - Yeah, I don't know.

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.440
 He's no mention on ping pong balls,

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.880
 but what's interesting is his favorite breakfast

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:47.880
 was quiche lorraine, and he used to make it himself.

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:48.720
 - What?

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.480
 - Yeah, so he would have to deal with this phobia

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:53.000
 until the egg no longer resembled an egg,

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:53.960
 and then he was fine with it.

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:55.080
 - Stick a hole in it.

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.640
 - Stick a hole in it, yeah.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.760
 - So that says to me it wasn't that serious.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:00.760
 Was it being still making his own quiche lorraine?

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:04.320
 - No, 'cause I think it's a sort of you face your fears

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.640
 and then it goes quite quickly once you get the fear.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.360
 For him, it was the shape and the lack of holes.

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:09.360
 - No, no, I know, but if I like,

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.800
 I don't like a house spider,

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:14.040
 and I can't just like go and kill a house spider really fast

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.080
 and be like, well, it was really quick,

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.360
 so it doesn't matter, I can't go near it.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.920
 - The other day Anna, a house spider fell on me

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:23.080
 as I was sitting up in bed from the ceiling.

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:23.920
 And it was-

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:24.760
 - You told me this before,

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:25.800
 I didn't enjoy the story at the time,

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:26.640
 I'm not enjoying it now.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:27.880
 - It was a four inch, it was big.

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:28.720
 - I don't like it.

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:29.560
 - And I was shirtless.

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:31.880
 - That's not four inches, what's going on?

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:34.440
 (all laughing)

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.600
 So Lowell Bender writes,

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:37.800
 "If you haven't already covered this,

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.600
 I'd like you to know that some US banks

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.400
 have their own zip code."

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.160
 - Ah, nice. - It's cool, isn't it?

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.240
 And then they write,

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:47.360
 "I came across this because for reasons unknown to me,

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:50.280
 meetup.com defaulted to that zip code,

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:53.600
 but I'm in and then they give their own zip code."

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:54.440
 - Which is?

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:57.080
 - Well, this might be a call for help really.

00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:58.080
 - Yeah, what's-

00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:59.480
 - What's meetup.com?

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:01.120
 - Well, it sounds like a dating site.

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:02.080
 - It does, doesn't it?

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:04.960
 - And it then sounds like he's trying to give his address

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:07.400
 on the podcast, or she, or they.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:10.040
 So I wonder if this is just a trick

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.640
 to try and get some fish lists.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:12.960
 - Yeah, get some free meetups.

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.720
 - Are we being cat-fished right now?

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.680
 - Wait, I'm so confused.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.680
 So this person went on a dating site

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.880
 and ended up accidentally booking in a date with a bank.

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:23.120
 (all laughing)

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.360
 Went to meet their date,

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:27.120
 had put misleading pictures up of a not bank,

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.560
 and then arrived and it was a bank.

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.400
 - No, it's- - Come over and make a deposit.

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.200
 - I bet the innuendo is going to be-

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.240
 - What's the safe word?

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:34.080
 There we go.

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:34.920
 - Yeah, there we go.

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:35.760
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:36.600
 - Put 'em up.

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:38.480
 (all laughing)

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.520
 - This is a stick up.

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:42.800
 (all laughing)

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.200
 - I make the same mistake every week when we do this,

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.120
 and then I go home and I get sushi

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.000
 for the thing next to the station,

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.680
 you know, which comes with soy sauce and wasabi sauce,

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:51.640
 and it's always 'round the train.

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:53.480
 So I squeeze in and then you have to get the chopsticks out

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:54.960
 and you have to open the soy sauce,

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:57.480
 and you have to open the sauce and it goes just everywhere.

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:59.800
 - And you have to ask someone to hold your finger bowl

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.600
 and it's, you had to take your shoes off as well.

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:03.600
 It's nightmare.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:04.880
 - But you know when you started you're like,

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:07.240
 people will think I've given up if I don't keep going.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.920
 So I'm always covered in soy sauce and it stinks.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:11.720
 - I don't think people think about you that much.

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:12.640
 I don't mean to offend,

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.400
 but just most people are busy with their own stuff.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.080
 They're not going to think that woman's only,

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.160
 that woman stopped eating her sushi halfway.

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:19.000
 What's going on?

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.960
 - Is that top podcaster, Anna Tosinski,

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.320
 eating half a sushi?

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:25.400
 - She's quit, isn't she?

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:27.240
 She's too embarrassed to finish it.

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:29.880
 - When's she going to eat the other half of it?

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:32.120
 (all laughing)

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:33.480
 - It's for her dinner.

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:34.960
 - Oh shit, I missed my stuff.

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.080
 (all laughing)

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:37.920
 - It was worth it.

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:38.760
 It was worth it.

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:43.080
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:44.360
 and that is Andy.

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.200
 My fact is that after Chernobyl,

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.720
 nearby children were tweeted,

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.880
 and they taught, they taught.

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:54.360
 Putty tat, oh dear.

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:55.480
 - Good.

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:58.280
 - Someone sent us a tweet this morning, actually,

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:01.200
 Sean Gibson, and it was referring to,

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:04.400
 it's just a headline from the Intelligencia Journal

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:06.680
 in Pennsylvania, from 1913.

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:09.720
 Self-rising bed exceeds expectations

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.840
 and throws inventor out of the window.

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:13.960
 (all laughing)

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:15.640
 No more information given.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.480
 - Brilliant, they need it.

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.240
 - The thing that you have always done for hiccups,

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.320
 since I was Tony, is you drink some water upside down.

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:22.880
 - Yeah, all of that stuff is rubbish.

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:23.720
 - No, it works.

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:24.560
 - No, it doesn't, Andy.

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:25.400
 - It's just a distraction technique.

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:26.240
 - It works for me.

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.080
 - It works for me.

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.320
 - No, it doesn't.

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.400
 - You're still hiccuping.

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.480
 (all laughing)

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:31.320
 You've been doing it all day.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:32.140
 - I'm not.

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:35.440
 - My headline fact this week,

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:39.960
 is from Jeffrey Partica, or Partica, or Party car.

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:40.880
 - Party car, yeah.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.200
 - Party car, yeah, it's Party car.

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.400
 - Remember when we went to Dublin

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:44.640
 and we got in a party car?

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:45.480
 - Yeah, that was great.

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:46.320
 - That was cool.

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.160
 - The taxi.

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.000
 - Unintentionally, we got in a--

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:48.840
 - I did not remember that.

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:50.320
 - We got a taxi home from a gig,

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:52.320
 and then the guy just pressed a button,

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:53.800
 and all the lights started going off,

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:55.040
 and there was like a disco ball,

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.080
 and they started playing music.

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:57.480
 - It just went thundersly disco.

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:59.160
 - They always do that in taxis for me.

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:00.000
 - It's very cool.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 - All right, one of you don't remember, yeah.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.280
 - Electric eels are not a type of eel.

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:07.120
 - Are they not?

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:07.960
 - No, they're not.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:08.800
 - I don't assume they were.

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:10.800
 - They're just an electric fish that's very long.

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.520
 But I thought I'd read about them anyway.

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:15.440
 There's this absolutely hero called Ken Katania,

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:17.400
 who's worked out what it feels like

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:20.200
 to be attacked by an electric eel,

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:23.720
 and he says that being attacked by a large electric eel

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:26.960
 is like being tasered by nine tasers at the same time.

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:30.240
 Well, what he did was he stuck his arm into a tank

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.680
 with a small eel, and did it 10 times,

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:35.400
 and he reckons because he knows how electric eels work,

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:37.680
 you could just extrapolate from the small eel

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.480
 to the size of a normal eel.

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:42.760
 So if you get bitten by a small electric eel,

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:45.480
 it's about the same as touching a horse fence.

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.080
 So do you know what that's like?

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:48.240
 - I do, actually, yeah.

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:50.640
 - 'Cause you like to steal horses, don't you?

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.080
 - I don't know, I used to raise on the podcast,

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.320
 but yeah, I'm a horse wrestler.

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:55.600
 - You've touched an electrified horse fence.

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.200
 - Yeah, well, 'cause you know, when you're a kid,

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.000
 we used to line up, so one of you touches the fence,

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.960
 and then everyone holds onto the other one's shoulders,

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:01.800
 and then you--

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:03.200
 - Okay, so it's a bit of a shock, it's not a, yeah.

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.240
 - It's quite a shock.

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:05.720
 - Hang on, if you're holding it normally,

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.120
 does it not shock you at all,

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.640
 because you're earthed with your rubber shoes and rubber?

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:11.080
 - The earthing is the problem, right?

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:12.360
 'Cause it goes through your body together.

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:13.200
 - Oh, sorry.

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.080
 So you're not wearing your big wellies at this point?

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:16.360
 - No, no, the whole point is to shock you

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:17.880
 and all your friends in a line.

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:19.960
 - Anyway, electrical is worse, he says,

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:21.280
 but he hasn't actually had the balls

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:23.520
 to sting himself with a proper big one.

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:26.400
 - No, because actually, if you're tazored by nine tazers,

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:27.520
 you're probably gonna die.

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:28.360
 - Yeah.

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:29.720
 - No, not a good idea, very not.

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.840
 (laughing)

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:34.640
 - And one interesting thing is that they use their electricity

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:38.200
 for electro-location, so they can, a bit like Sonar,

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.520
 they can kind of fire their electric field around

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:42.880
 and then feel where everything is.

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:45.920
 So, 'cause it's so dark and muddy down there,

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:48.040
 that's how they can see where everything is.

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:51.080
 But the sensors that they use, it's not exactly the same,

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.120
 but it's very, very similar principles

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:55.480
 to how your mobile phone works.

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:58.440
 So you know how there's sensors in there

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:00.480
 that kind of can tell that your finger's there

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.480
 and it's all about capacitors and blah, blah, blah.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:03.480
 I'm not gonna go into it now,

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.760
 but it's basically the same technology

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:07.840
 as electric heels use to find their way around.

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:09.880
 - You see, you've got all your clever computers

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:11.520
 and all your internets in the old days.

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:14.520
 We got around just with eel tech.

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.080
 (laughing)

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:17.520
 And we jelly 'em up at the end of the day

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:20.060
 and it was absolutely horrible.

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:22.320
 (laughing)

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:26.240
 - Isn't it weird that when you have a vasectomy

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:28.000
 and then you produce semen,

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.240
 what would you think that looks like?

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:31.880
 'Cause you know when you think about, you picture semen.

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:32.720
 - Yeah.

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:33.560
 - And you think that that's--

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:34.760
 - I can't picture anything in my head,

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:37.080
 but I'm not even gonna try this one.

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:38.600
 - It probably looks absolutely identical.

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:40.880
 Yeah, maybe, or just a bit more watery.

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:43.000
 - That's what I would have thought it looks more watery

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.040
 'cause it looks more transparent maybe.

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.960
 - Maybe it doesn't have those green bits.

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:49.200
 (laughing)

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:55.600
 - We've still got the chunky cheesy bits, right?

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:56.920
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:59.680
 (laughing)

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:01.880
 It's a different chew they need to cut, James.

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:03.320
 - I thought it doesn't sparkle.

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:05.200
 (laughing)

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.040
 - Well, in a way, it doesn't sparkle.

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:07.880
 - It doesn't sing.

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.400
 It doesn't make that weird singing sound.

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:12.160
 (laughing)

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:15.080
 - It's just from screaming as they go.

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:15.920
 - Don't do it!

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:16.760
 - You're on it!

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:18.200
 (laughing)

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.920
 - I go to Valhalla!

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:22.200
 We will fight them on the beach.

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.040
 - So Anna--

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:23.880
 - This hasn't got more I wanted to.

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:24.720
 It's just the same.

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:26.040
 - Where did you want it to go?

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:28.040
 Where on earth did you want that to go?

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:30.620
 (upbeat music)

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:34.320
 - Okey-dokey.

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:36.240
 Hope you enjoyed that compilation.

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:38.360

 And we will cherry pick some of the best emails

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:49.960

 and use them in a future Drop Us Align episode.

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:55.560
 All right, Club Fish members, that is it.

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:56.400
 Take care.

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.360
 We will see you soon.

00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:58.200
 Goodbye.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:00.780
