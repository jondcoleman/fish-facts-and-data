00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,960
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:04,160
 Hey, Club Fish members, how you doing?

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,000
 It's Dan here.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Hope you're well.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,680
 Welcome to your bonus bit of content.

6
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,760
 This is a compilation episode that we have for you today,

7
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,520
 all the best bits that didn't make it into the main episode,

8
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,200
 largely 'cause they just didn't fit the narrative.

9
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,520
 So, hope you enjoy it.

10
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,640
 But before we get to it, just a quick reminder,

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,240
 if you happen to be in Sheffield,

12
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,640
 we're gonna be there doing fish live

13
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,720
 at the Crossed Wires Festival.

14
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,920
 Alice Levine put together this awesome podcast festival.

15
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,040
 There's gonna be multiple shows down there.

16
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,800
 So, if you're around on the 6th of July,

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,280
 we're gonna be there from 2 p.m. recording a live show.

18
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,640
 Do come along, it's gonna be lots of fun.

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,240
 Tickets are available at crossedwires.live,

 Okay, that's it.

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,800
 Let's get to the main episode now.

24
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,640
 Here we go.

25
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,560
 The best of the bits that didn't make it on with the show.

26
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,260
 (upbeat music)

27
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:14,640
 - Hi, everybody, Andy here.

28
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,960
 Welcome to an audience fact special episode

29
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,240
 of No Such Thing as a Fish.

30
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,200
 You have all been sending your facts to podcast@qi.com.

31
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,680
 Is that the address?

32
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,520
 - That's the address.

33
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,040
 That's what I say every week, so I hope so.

34
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,200
 - Well, they've been getting through,

35
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,560
 and they've been coming in thick and fast.

36
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,160
 And we've creamed off the ones on the top,

37
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,440
 and we're gonna be reading them out

38
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,400
 and sharing them back with you now.

39
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,720
 - It's harder than it looks, isn't it, Andy?

40
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,720
 - It's a very difficult job.

41
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,080
 Damn, this is amazing.

42
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:41,920
 (laughing)

43
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,760
 - I'm happy to be here.

44
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,240
 Do you wanna mention who else is here?

45
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,360
 (laughing)

46
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,680
 - Where are we as well?

47
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,440
 And how often does this podcast go out?

48
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,960
 - God.

49
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,280
 - Can I tell you one last thing about the boss for us?

50
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,120
 - Yeah.

51
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,000
 - Constantinople and how it was defended.

52
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,560
 There's one weakness in a naval sense.

53
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,120
 There's a waterway which is calm and navigable.

54
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,680
 And basically, if you could sail your ships in there.

55
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,740
 - Oh, like a harbour.

56
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,960
 - Yeah, you could invade,

57
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,640
 and it would be incredibly easy to invade.

58
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,880
 So how did Constantinople, as it was then,

59
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,800
 solve this problem?

60
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,120
 - Cannons.

61
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,600
 - Great idea.

62
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,600
 Arguably better than what they came up with.

63
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,080
 (laughing)

64
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,000
 - Crocodiles.

65
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,200
 - Crocodiles, good call.

66
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,040
 - That's good.

67
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,760
 - So I was going to tell you about the chain of the Golden Horn.

68
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,600
 - Okay.

69
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,480
 - They had a massive chain just across the water.

70
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,320
 - Yeah.

71
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,680
 - Like a rope barrier outside a nightclub.

72
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,680
 - I thought didn't this work though?

73
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,120
 - Actually, I'm being unfair.

74
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,440
 It worked better than you'd think it would.

75
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,880
 It's about half a mile long.

76
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,720
 - Okay.

77
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,560
 - Just this huge chain across the water,

78
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,800
 and then they can lower it

79
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,880
 if someone approaches who's friendly.

80
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,720
 And then what?

81
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,560
 Joink it up again.

82
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,720
 - They were quite common, those things, I think.

83
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,560
 - Okay.

84
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,280
 - Yeah, I've heard of them before.

85
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,280
 I heard of one.

86
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,920
 This is in like British history,

87
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,320
 but there was one of them somewhere

88
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,280
 where someone was in a boat

89
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,280
 and they went in the boat towards this chain

90
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,240
 and they're going to hit it.

91
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,200
 And what happened was everyone on the boat

92
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,400
 ran to the back of the boat,

93
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,480
 so it lifted the front of it.

94
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,320
 So they went over it

95
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,000
 and then everyone ran to the front.

96
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,960
 - Surely not.

97
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,360
 That was like a heralded to story if I ever heard one.

98
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,640
 - I think it is a story,

99
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,600
 like I remember where it's from.

100
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,440
 - It's good.

101
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,280
 - That's great.

102
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,160
 - There was a report in Scientific American in 1858

103
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,640
 about a healthy person called Mr. Gru,

104
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,840
 but he was born without a sternum or a breastbone.

105
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,800
 And so you could see completely clearly his heart

106
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,360
 and part of his lungs.

107
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,920
 So it was just a thin layer of skin around it.

108
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,600
 And so he'd be exhibited in theaters around Europe

109
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,960
 for a few years and in lecture halls

110
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,680
 because it really helped doctors know

111
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,800
 about the structure of the heart and how it beat

112
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,120
 'cause he'd literally stand at the front of a lecture hall

113
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,440
 and you'd be sitting at the back

114
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,520
 and you could see his heart boom-bombing

115
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,560
 and bouncing out of his chest.

116
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,520
 - 'Cause he didn't grew properly.

117
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,920
 He was just--

118
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,760
 - Wow, good stuff.

119
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,600
 Yeah.

120
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,680
 - It wasn't Gru the name of the guy from Despicable Me.

121
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,520
 - Yeah, yes.

122
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,720
 - And so did he have this?

123
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,320
 And then he thought he was so exceptional

124
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,560
 that he decided to take over the world with his minions.

125
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,680
 - And that's what that's based on.

126
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,520
 - Yes.

127
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,360
 - There we go.

128
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,200
 - What kind of full circle?

129
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,040
 - Did he have ribs?

130
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,200
 And if so, where did they meet?

131
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,040
 - I think maybe the ribs didn't meet.

132
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,040
 No breastbone.

133
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,360
 - It feels like they wouldn't meet.

134
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,200
 - Yeah.

135
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,040
 - They just sort of stop.

136
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:15,880
 - Big hole.

137
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,720
 - It just floats.

138
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,560
 That feels very painful.

139
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,800
 - There are muscles between your ribs.

140
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,320
 So it would stay in place.

141
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,320
 - Right.

142
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,280
 - It wouldn't be good to like,

143
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,160
 my daughter likes to jump on my chest.

144
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,000
 That wouldn't be great.

145
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,840
 - Oh.

146
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,680
 - You have to just limit that.

147
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,500
 - Yeah.

148
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,880
 - And if he coughed or sneezed,

149
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,880
 then his lung really bounced out of his chest.

150
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,440
 You really see it as long.

151
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,000
 - And if he really fancied someone like Jessica Rabbit,

152
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 walking past his heart really pumped out of his chest.

153
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,320
 - There was actually a really sad study

154
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,280
 about which bits of their lives people would skip.

155
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,000
 Like if they could say skip ahead five minutes

156
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,840
 for about 10 minutes.

157
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,920
 I've found that people would skip a huge proportion of it.

158
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,780
 Obviously, 'cause most of your life is just drudgery.

159
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,120
 Like if we could skip to the end of this guys,

160
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,000
 we wouldn't, wouldn't we?

161
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,360
 - Well, people listening could just fast forward to the answer.

162
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,360
 - If only we could.

163
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,640
 - Accessory breasts.

164
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,480
 That's another thing.

165
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,320
 - Accessory.

166
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,160
 - Okay.

167
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,640
 So you know the classic total recall three boobed lady,

168
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,440
 three boobs is a thing.

169
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,800
 But like Andy's saying,

170
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,240
 you might not know where to find it.

171
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,880
 So it's quite possible that you have three lactating breasts.

172
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,040
 But in the image that I saw,

173
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,040
 which to be fair was a drawing,

174
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,120
 a lady was breastfeeding her child

175
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,080
 and then thigh feeding her other child

176
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,160
 because the breast had criss.

177
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,480
 - Was this something real?

178
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,320
 - Yeah.

179
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,960
 - This isn't from one of your manga.

180
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,560
 (all laughing)

181
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,760
 - That's collection of erotic manga

182
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,040
 is unparalleled in this hemisphere.

183
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,880
 - Saint Jerome was a famous translator.

184
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,720
 - Really?

185
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,440
 - Not through like audio.

186
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,200
 He would translate the Bible into the Vulgate.

187
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,120
 And what he did was he took the sort of Hebrew Bible

188
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,920
 and then he put it into Latin,

189
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,080
 but he'd put it into a way that everyone could understand.

190
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,800
 So he put, he changed some of the words

191
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,880
 that maybe he shouldn't have done.

192
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,880
 So there was a, in fact, a Greek word, which was Maschia,

193
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,320
 which meant like Messiah.

194
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,440
 And he changed it to Christos,

195
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,800
 meaning anointed.

196
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,160
 But actually the more reasonable way of translating that

197
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,200
 would be unctus, meaning anointed.

198
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,840
 And that is why we call Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ,

199
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,400
 because of that translation.

200
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,240
 - Oh, wow.

201
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,760
 So we should call him unctus.

202
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,600
 - Jesus unct.

203
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,440
 - Jesus unct.

204
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,280
 Yeah.

205
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,600
 Unctiano Ronaldo.

206
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,440
 - What's that doing?

207
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,760
 - It should be like,

208
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,920
 anyone called Christian or anything like that

209
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,080
 should be unctiano, really.

210
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,920
 - That's so funny.

211
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,280
 - He is quite an oily man.

212
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,360
 - Well, exactly.

213
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,720
 - But isn't it amazing like one little bit of translation

214
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,600
 can change so much in history?

215
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,400
 - That's where we get Christopher from as well, isn't it?

216
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,640
 - Yeah, Christian and everything.

217
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,920
 - No, unctophosan, for example.

218
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,160
 (both laughing)

219
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,240
 - Unctophosan.

220
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,560
 - The only thing I know about Saint Jerome

221
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,600
 is that he apparently told,

222
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,160
 I think this is in the realms of maybe true,

223
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,000
 maybe not be true.

224
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,600
 He told nuns not to eat beans

225
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,000
 because he thought the flatulence that they would produce

226
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,960
 is so close to their front, bottom,

227
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,440
 that they might induce orgasms accidentally

228
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,920
 off the tickling sensation of the fart.

229
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,320
 So he said, "Tony beans, nuns."

230
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,400
 And he went back to translating the Bible.

231
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,680
 (both laughing)

232
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,920
 - There's a story told by John Sessions on QI

233
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,880
 in one of the early series that you guys might remember

234
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,520
 which I always love.

235
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,600
 And I actually don't know,

236
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,440
 I think his source would have been,

237
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,480
 he's been told by someone else

238
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,880
 who was told by Gandhi himself, probably.

239
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,800
 That's what I'm assuming.

240
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,080
 But basically in the scene,

241
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,280
 so there are 300,000 extras, as you say,

242
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,200
 and Richard Attenborough's the director.

243
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,320
 And the person who's organizing all the extras

244
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,680
 in the whole scene is this other guy called David Tomlin

245
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,960
 who's overseeing this funeral scene.

246
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,720
 So Gandhi's just died and Attenborough says to Tomlin,

247
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,440
 "You've got to tell these 300,000 extras

248
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,840
 how they're gonna behave."

249
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,720
 And Gandhi's just died, the hero,

250
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,800
 like the ultimate icon of their country.

251
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,640
 This is the worst news they've ever heard.

252
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,720
 They're devastated, their lives have fallen apart

253
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,840
 before their very eyes.

254
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,040
 Can you possibly convey to them how they have to act?

255
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,960
 So David Tomlin just turned around to this crowd

256
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,360
 and said, "Right, listen up, Gandhi's dead

257
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,800
 and you're all fucking sad."

258
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,240
 (both laughing)

259
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,080
 - Wow.

260
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,920
 - Yeah, it works.

261
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,200
 - That's very good.

262
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,240
 - So there are three bridges now,

263
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,600
 I think spanning the Bosphorus

264
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,200
 and built at various different times.

265
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,240
 But the 1973 one, the first one was the Game Changer.

266
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,480
 In 1960s, you had to wait two and a half hours to cross,

267
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,280
 I think by car, but it was just so clogged.

268
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,680
 And then for vans and lorries,

269
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,320
 it was days you had to wait to cross by boat

270
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,600
 before the bridges happened.

271
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,760
 - Oh yeah.

272
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,000
 - And I listened to this amazing interview with Harvey Binney,

273
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,600
 who's one of the architects, British guy.

274
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,760
 He's retired now obviously, because it was a long time ago.

275
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,080
 And he was interviewed by the BBC

276
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,520
 and here's a good riddle, me this.

277
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,440
 - Oh, hey, go on.

278
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,760
 - The distance between the tops of the two towers,

279
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,160
 'cause it's a suspension bridge.

280
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,240
 It's got two towers spanning the middle of it,

281
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,520
 is different at the top and at the bottom.

282
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,080
 Riddle me this, the...

283
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,440
 - Sorry, so as in you take the top

284
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,400
 and then you go straight down that pole to the bottom.

285
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,640
 - But those towers are not straight.

286
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,880
 - Well, they are straight.

287
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,720
 - Oh.

288
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,560
 - Or is it the curvature of the earth?

289
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,440
 - The earth is not straight.

290
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,520
 - That was right, what I said.

291
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,520
 - Yeah.

292
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,960
 - Because they had to build both towers absolutely straight,

293
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,240
 but it's such a distance apart

294
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,440
 that if you build them both straight,

295
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,120
 the curvature of the earth comes into play.

296
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,080
 And it's about 10 centimetres different at the top.

297
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,920
 - Who's it?

298
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,640
 - And he said, look, we did have to take that into account

299
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,160
 because you don't want to end up with like 10 centimetres.

300
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,040
 You don't want to miss 10 centimetres of cable.

301
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,600
 - It's long, but it's not that long.

302
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,640
 - The earth doesn't feel that curved, does it?

303
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,000
 - I know, the earth is more curved than you'd think.

304
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,640
 - The earth is a lot more curved than dad thinks.

305
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,480
 - Hell yeah.

306
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,000
 (all laughing)

307
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,560
 - Only joking, I'll need that.

308
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,480
 - We're just constantly losing giant containers

309
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,520
 off the back of sherps.

310
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,360
 - Why don't they pick it?

311
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,320
 - You'd want to fish them out and see what's in each one.

312
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,160
 - You would, right?

313
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,000
 - It could be a container of baked beans,

314
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,200
 a container of Barbies.

315
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,600
 - That is a fun format for a TV show.

316
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,560
 - How does it work, sorry?

317
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,600
 - They already do this.

318
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,000
 - Well, it's a team of celebrities.

319
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,320
 - But there is one of these that exists,

320
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,440
 but it's on land, right?

321
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,680
 Where you go into containers and you open them much.

322
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,840
 - That's it, it's an American show.

323
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,520
 And you get like, you take an old container unit

324
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,320
 that's not been claimed.

325
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,160
 Or it's like--

326
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,720
 - It's run out, they've paid their rent.

327
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,280
 - Yeah, that doesn't download for this show.

328
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,000
 - And a load of experts can look inside,

329
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,720
 but they can't go in, they can't open anything up.

330
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,480
 So you just have to bid an amount for it

331
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,960
 based on what you think might be in there.

332
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,600
 - Yeah, what is it called, you've told me.

333
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,600
 - Nothing wrong with liking a really good show, you know?

334
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,440
 - It's called Storage Wars.

335
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,280
 - Storage Wars.

336
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,320
 - Can I just say if the producers of Storage Wars

337
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,040
 are listening and they want a celebrity to come on,

338
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,160
 then Dan is available.

339
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,200
 - I am available.

340
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,240
 - It's more outlandish, isn't it?

341
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,800
 I'll send you in this little rowing boat

342
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,200
 to the middle of Pacific Ocean to find a container.

343
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,480
 - The thing about heartbeats is

344
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,320
 some people can hear their own heartbeats

345
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,920
 better than others, and this is called entereception.

346
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,520
 And it's the ability to interpret signals

347
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,320
 from inside your body, so.

348
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,040
 - I'm so hoping you don't say this means

349
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,040
 they're gonna die prematurely

350
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,560
 because I hear my heartbeats so loudly all the time.

351
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,000
 - You're more likely to report having anxiety

352
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,240
 if you do that, and you're more likely to,

353
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,440
 if your heartbeat changes slightly,

354
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,960
 to think it's something to be worried about,

355
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,720
 whereas actually normally people's heartbeats

356
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,320
 do change quite a lot throughout the course of a day.

357
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,080
 And actually the best thing is to have a medium.

358
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,800
 You wanna sometimes hear it a little bit,

359
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,240
 but not be obsessed with it, basically.

360
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,000
 - So are you concerned about it sometimes, Anna?

361
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,160
 - No, I don't get concerned.

362
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,000
 I just, it keeps me awake.

363
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,240
 Sometimes 'cause you lie down on your pillow,

364
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,240
 you can always hear it in your ear.

365
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,800
 - So do you, yeah, do you hear it internally

366
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,520
 or can you hear it outwardly?

367
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,360
 - Hear it out?

368
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,120
 What, like, hear it before you get to my shirt?

369
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,200
 - Yeah, can you, no.

370
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,400
 That's physically, I mean, can you hear the noise?

371
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,600
 - You're not a cartoon character, Anna.

372
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,400
 Could your husband hear the noise

373
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,080
 or is it through your inner ear?

374
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,320
 - I've never asked him, but I snore so loudly

375
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,480
 that I think it would cover up any noise I'm making.

376
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,640
 - You're like the Telltale Heart by Edgar Ellingham.

377
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,480
 - Oh, yeah.

378
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,960
 - You're like that your whole life.

379
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,960
 - I am.

380
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,280
 Hang on, what does the heart tell?

381
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,120
 It beats and it tells someone.

382
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,280
 - He's murdered someone.

383
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,080
 - He's murdered the old man.

384
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,920
 Oh, it happens right away.

385
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,520
 It's sort of straight away, he kills the old man

386
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,240
 'cause he's got this weird eye.

387
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,080
 The old man has a weird eye.

388
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,800
 The guy hates that this old man has this weird eye

389
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,960
 and he gets obsessed with it

390
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,920
 and he decides, "Oh, am I gonna have to kill the old man?"

391
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,800
 I mean, I think I just live in the same building

392
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,640
 or something, it's always his landlord or something.

393
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,280
 But he kills him and then he keeps hearing it.

394
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,720
 He buries it under the floorboards

395
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,120
 and he keeps hearing his heartbeat.

396
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,680
 And some people come around to investigate.

397
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,120
 We've heard there's been an old man murdered.

398
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,960
 Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

399
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,080
 He's like, "Can you not hear that?"

400
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,920
 - No one else can hear it.

401
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,200
 - Like, "No, no, Hannah's in the car now."

402
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,320
 (all laughing)

403
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,800
 - I was actually looking up.

404
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,000
 'Cause I was thinking I like eel in Japanese restaurants,

405
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,800
 which is the only context I've really had it,

406
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,720
 but obviously it used to be a huge thing.

407
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,600
 You'd mostly in London and Cockneys

408
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,960
 and everyone ate Jelly Deal, right?

409
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,600
 You'd have pie mash and eel shops or whatever.

410
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,440
 - That's right.

411
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,040
 - And I was wondering, was it nice?

412
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,000
 And honestly, I've been through so many forums

413
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,920
 where people were reminiscing about eating it

414
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,080
 and not a single person has said it wasn't disgusting.

415
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,600
 - And presumably if you're posting on those forums,

416
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,200
 you're a kind of nostalgia called buffer.

417
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,040
 - Exactly.

418
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,040
 - Like that I would think is the prime territory.

419
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,880
 - You're desperate to say,

420
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,040
 "Oh, it was better in the good old days."

421
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,920
 And they all just had to know it was rank.

422
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,360
 I thought after Brexit, I thought we're gonna get it back.

423
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,200
 - Did you?

424
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,240
 - I thought, yeah, that was the sunlit uplands

425
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,580
 that I was looking for.

426
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,400
 - That's what you voted for, wasn't it?

427
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,680
 - Bring back the Jelly Deals.

428
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,040
 - No, actually, Brexit has stuffed the eel thing.

429
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:31,880
 - Oh no.

430
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,240
 - I'm so sorry, it has.

431
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,320
 - Wasted boat jams.

432
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,600
 - I'm sure you guys are familiar

433
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,280
 with the Sustainable Eel Group.

434
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,400
 Basically, we used to ship 10 million eels a year to Europe.

435
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,160
 Legally, this isn't trafficked.

436
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,400
 And more than half of that was for rewilding.

437
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,160
 'Cause if you get an eel swimming into the seven asteroid,

438
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,080
 it's screwed, right?

439
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,400
 It's like, it can't get up the seven asteroid tour

440
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,600
 but it's spawning ground.

441
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,840
 The river is too blocked up.

442
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,560
 But there are loads of places in Europe

443
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,760
 where you can introduce Neil, it'll swim up,

444
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,160
 it'll find a cracking place to spawn, whatever.

445
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,240
 And you've done a great job there.

446
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,040
 But Brexit has ruined it, so.

447
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,840
 - 'Cause they can't fill in the paperwork and stuff.

448
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,800
 - It's okay.

449
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,280
 Yeah, they can't fill in the paperwork.

450
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,120
 'Cause it basically trade barriers.

451
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,640
 - Yeah, it's a bit of a pain.

452
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,200
 - Does your heart really go bum-bum-bum?

453
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,160
 Does it just go bum and you've just heard

454
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,520
 the bum-bum in movies?

455
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,360
 Or is it an echo?

456
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,360
 Is the bum-bum-bum?

457
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,680
 - If you've got a very hollow body.

458
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,520
 - Yeah.

459
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,360
 - For a hollow head.

460
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,480
 - I'm just testing now.

461
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,800
 - It does go bum-bum sometimes.

462
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,520
 I might be too very hard, I think.

463
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,520
 - I can only hear the,

464
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,680
 the moment I can only hear the bum.

465
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,840
 - Yeah.

466
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,800
 - Well, you'll be using your pulse.

467
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,640
 - Yeah.

468
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,480
 - You're not listening to your.

469
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,480
 - But it's like, for instance, if you listen.

470
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,520
 - Wait, what do you think the heart is?

471
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,200
 - Well, I think the heart,

472
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,680
 the bum-bum I associate with heart, not with my pulse.

473
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,680
 I know that you can feel the pulse.

474
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,120
 But you can't say, oh, I can hear my heart

475
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,080
 by touching your veins on your wrist.

476
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,920
 - Yeah.

477
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,760
 - Okay, hang on.

478
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,600
 - This has all got a bit stoner,

479
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,080
 but go on, James, bring it back.

480
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,200
 - Well, I doubt I will.

481
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,800
 But it's like with a clock.

482
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,800
 You know, a clock ticks, but it doesn't talk.

483
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,880
 It just goes tick, tick, tick.

484
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,080
 'Cause it's the same mechanism doing it all the time.

485
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,960
 But if you listen to it, you can almost hear a talk,

486
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,920
 even though there's not one there

487
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,960
 because you're expecting it.

488
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,320
 - I was playing it cool by agreeing with you,

489
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,160
 but I absolutely thought there was a talk.

490
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,480
 (laughing)

491
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,480
 - I thought in every clock,

492
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,200
 they'd entered two different tones just before.

493
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,960
 - I thought the pendulum, yeah,

494
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,440
 I assumed for years and years and years.

495
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,440
 When the pendulum goes one way,

496
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,320
 that makes a tick sound.

497
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,440
 And then, I don't know, inside the glass cabinet,

498
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,840
 there's something which makes it sound

499
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,080
 a bit different going the other way.

500
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,560
 - It's weird that you've still got that pendulum watch.

501
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,320
 - There is a different kind of eel,

502
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,720
 which does a similar-ish thing.

503
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,160
 It's called a snake eel.

504
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:35,440
 And they have a very pointy tip on their tail.

505
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,160
 And they use it in a slightly different way.

506
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,240
 They use it just to power out of the stomach of the fish,

507
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,920
 which is eaten them sideways.

508
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,600
 And then they just go out of the stomach.

509
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,800
 - Oh, like pierce it.

510
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,280
 - They just pierce it, they just go through.

511
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,520
 - Well, that sounds not very good for the fish.

512
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,440
 - Well, it's not good for anyone

513
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,800
 'cause they can't get through the rib cage

514
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,480
 once they're through the stomach.

515
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,280
 So they just end up stuck in there.

516
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,480
 - That's like a blooper from the alien movies.

517
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,160
 (laughing)

518
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,920
 The alien's like, "I'm stuck, we're gonna have to do this again."

519
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,880
 - Yeah, and the fish doesn't even notice.

520
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,160
 Fish can cope with a lot of stuff.

521
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,480
 - Something piercing a big hole in its stomach

522
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,520
 and then landing up squirming around in its rib cage.

523
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,000
 I don't know whether they don't notice,

524
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,720
 but they definitely don't take any action.

525
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,560
 - They play it cool.

526
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,400
 - They play it cool, yeah.

527
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,240
 - Good on 'em.

528
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,280
 - You know, if you eat mussels as a human,

529
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,200
 you put them in the pot and it's boiling water.

530
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,120
 - Oh, yes, and they often come back out, don't they?

531
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,680
 Quite soon afterwards.

532
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,240
 - But you're not supposed to eat the closed ones

533
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,600
 'cause they might come out.

534
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,600
 Well, that is actually true.

535
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,320
 If you see an enemy, if you eat a mussel and it's closed,

536
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,120
 then the mussel can just go through your body

537
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,120
 and come out the other end

538
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,920
 and the mussel will still be fine.

539
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,760
 - Oh, really?

540
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,600
 - Yeah.

541
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,160
 - Whereas normally what they'll do is

542
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,520
 they'll bring in the mussel and the shell

543
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,600
 and then they'll eat the mussel and eject the shell,

544
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,600
 but if it's closed, they can't get us the mussel.

545
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,920
 - Do the enemies, anemones, eat the whole thing

546
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,640
 and then just sort it out inside?

547
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,480
 - Yes, they do.

548
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,920
 - 'Cause that's a more dignified way of eating, I think.

549
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,760
 - Yeah.

550
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,120
 - Now, if you could do that with a lobster.

551
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,880
 - If you could do that with a Big Mac

552
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,440
 and you put in the entire, the burger

553
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,640
 and the bit of plastic that comes, that goes around it.

554
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,640
 - With the plastic on the cheese.

555
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,080
 - Or if you could, yeah.

556
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,640
 (laughing)

557
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,200
 Or if you could do it with a Kinder Egg

558
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,440
 and then you could eat the whole thing

559
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,560
 and you could even make the tie inside you.

560
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,400
 - I love that.

561
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,240
 (laughing)

562
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,080
 Just open your mouth.

563
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,880
 There's a little mechanical wiggle on there.

564
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,000
 50% of eel consumed on the planet is eaten in Japan.

565
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,840
 - It's big.

566
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:25,960
 - And if you go to a Japanese restaurant,

567
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,600
 they'll always have, they have eel on the menu.

568
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,040
 But the nice news is that 35% of Japanese people

569
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,840
 are willing to eat cultured eel.

570
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,680
 - As in--

571
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,520
 - What eel that goes to the theater?

572
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,360
 - That's right.

573
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,200
 (laughing)

574
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,120
 It costs more because obviously you've seen

575
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,200
 the prices of the restaurant these days, all right.

576
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,400
 (laughing)

577
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,800
 No, you can, it's saffron-lay-miz.

578
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,640
 (laughing)

579
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,480
 It liked Hamilton.

580
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,320
 It didn't love it.

581
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,880
 Like, it wasn't five stars.

582
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,280
 But no, it's like, you can grow really good eel now.

583
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,960
 You know, the art of it, like growing meats

584
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,440
 which are of different varieties.

585
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,240
 The eel you can get now is really realistic.

586
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,160
 - We're at like fake eel.

587
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,000
 - Yeah, yeah.

588
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,840
 - Oh, wow, really?

589
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,760
 - It looks like it, it tastes like it, all of that, you know.

590
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,040
 So that might be quite good.

591
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,200
 - And how many Japanese people are willing to eat that?

592
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,040
 - Over a third.

593
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,320
 - That's good figures.

594
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,200
 That's much better than like proportions of American people

595
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,880
 who would be willing to eat fake meat.

596
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,840
 I suspect culture meat.

597
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,360
 - Yeah, but we all say we're willing to eat kangaroo testicles

598
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,200
 until we're actually on.

599
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,760
 I'm a celebrity to get me out of here.

600
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,600
 (laughing)

601
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,360
 And then you don't want to, you're right, you're right.

602
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,760
 - Alfred Hitchcock was terrified of eggs, had ovo-phobia.

603
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,240
 So he said the white round thing without any holes.

604
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,800
 That's how he referred to eggs.

605
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,720
 And when you break it inside,

606
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,320
 there's that yellow thing round without any holes.

607
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,760
 So I think he likes holes and he doesn't like eggs.

608
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,240
 - Did he like ping pong balls?

609
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,080
 - Yeah, I don't know.

610
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,440
 He's no mention on ping pong balls,

611
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,880
 but what's interesting is his favorite breakfast

612
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,880
 was quiche lorraine, and he used to make it himself.

613
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,720
 - What?

614
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,480
 - Yeah, so he would have to deal with this phobia

615
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,000
 until the egg no longer resembled an egg,

616
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,960
 and then he was fine with it.

617
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,080
 - Stick a hole in it.

618
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,640
 - Stick a hole in it, yeah.

619
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,760
 - So that says to me it wasn't that serious.

620
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,760
 Was it being still making his own quiche lorraine?

621
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,320
 - No, 'cause I think it's a sort of you face your fears

622
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,640
 and then it goes quite quickly once you get the fear.

623
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,360
 For him, it was the shape and the lack of holes.

624
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,360
 - No, no, I know, but if I like,

625
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,800
 I don't like a house spider,

626
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,040
 and I can't just like go and kill a house spider really fast

627
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,080
 and be like, well, it was really quick,

628
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,360
 so it doesn't matter, I can't go near it.

629
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,920
 - The other day Anna, a house spider fell on me

630
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,080
 as I was sitting up in bed from the ceiling.

631
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:23,920
 And it was-

632
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,760
 - You told me this before,

633
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,800
 I didn't enjoy the story at the time,

634
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,640
 I'm not enjoying it now.

635
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,880
 - It was a four inch, it was big.

636
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,720
 - I don't like it.

637
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,560
 - And I was shirtless.

638
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,880
 - That's not four inches, what's going on?

639
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,440
 (all laughing)

640
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,600
 So Lowell Bender writes,

641
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,800
 "If you haven't already covered this,

642
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,600
 I'd like you to know that some US banks

643
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,400
 have their own zip code."

644
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,160
 - Ah, nice. - It's cool, isn't it?

645
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,240
 And then they write,

646
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,360
 "I came across this because for reasons unknown to me,

647
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,280
 meetup.com defaulted to that zip code,

648
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,600
 but I'm in and then they give their own zip code."

649
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,440
 - Which is?

650
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,080
 - Well, this might be a call for help really.

651
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,080
 - Yeah, what's-

652
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,480
 - What's meetup.com?

653
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,120
 - Well, it sounds like a dating site.

654
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,080
 - It does, doesn't it?

655
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,960
 - And it then sounds like he's trying to give his address

656
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,400
 on the podcast, or she, or they.

657
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,040
 So I wonder if this is just a trick

658
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,640
 to try and get some fish lists.

659
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,960
 - Yeah, get some free meetups.

660
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,720
 - Are we being cat-fished right now?

661
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,680
 - Wait, I'm so confused.

662
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,680
 So this person went on a dating site

663
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,880
 and ended up accidentally booking in a date with a bank.

664
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,120
 (all laughing)

665
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,360
 Went to meet their date,

666
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,120
 had put misleading pictures up of a not bank,

667
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,560
 and then arrived and it was a bank.

668
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,400
 - No, it's- - Come over and make a deposit.

669
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,200
 - I bet the innuendo is going to be-

670
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,240
 - What's the safe word?

671
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,080
 There we go.

672
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:34,920
 - Yeah, there we go.

673
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,760
 - Yeah, yeah.

674
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,600
 - Put 'em up.

675
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,480
 (all laughing)

676
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,520
 - This is a stick up.

677
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,800
 (all laughing)

678
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,200
 - I make the same mistake every week when we do this,

679
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,120
 and then I go home and I get sushi

680
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,000
 for the thing next to the station,

681
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,680
 you know, which comes with soy sauce and wasabi sauce,

682
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,640
 and it's always 'round the train.

683
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,480
 So I squeeze in and then you have to get the chopsticks out

684
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,960
 and you have to open the soy sauce,

685
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,480
 and you have to open the sauce and it goes just everywhere.

686
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,800
 - And you have to ask someone to hold your finger bowl

687
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,600
 and it's, you had to take your shoes off as well.

688
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,600
 It's nightmare.

689
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,880
 - But you know when you started you're like,

690
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,240
 people will think I've given up if I don't keep going.

691
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,920
 So I'm always covered in soy sauce and it stinks.

692
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,720
 - I don't think people think about you that much.

693
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,640
 I don't mean to offend,

694
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,400
 but just most people are busy with their own stuff.

695
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,080
 They're not going to think that woman's only,

696
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,160
 that woman stopped eating her sushi halfway.

697
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,000
 What's going on?

698
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,960
 - Is that top podcaster, Anna Tosinski,

699
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,320
 eating half a sushi?

700
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,400
 - She's quit, isn't she?

701
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,240
 She's too embarrassed to finish it.

702
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,880
 - When's she going to eat the other half of it?

703
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,120
 (all laughing)

704
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,480
 - It's for her dinner.

705
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,960
 - Oh shit, I missed my stuff.

706
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,080
 (all laughing)

707
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:37,920
 - It was worth it.

708
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,760
 It was worth it.

709
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:43,080
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

710
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,360
 and that is Andy.

711
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,200
 My fact is that after Chernobyl,

712
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,720
 nearby children were tweeted,

713
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,880
 and they taught, they taught.

714
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,360
 Putty tat, oh dear.

715
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,480
 - Good.

716
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,280
 - Someone sent us a tweet this morning, actually,

717
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,200
 Sean Gibson, and it was referring to,

718
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,400
 it's just a headline from the Intelligencia Journal

719
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,680
 in Pennsylvania, from 1913.

720
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,720
 Self-rising bed exceeds expectations

721
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,840
 and throws inventor out of the window.

722
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,960
 (all laughing)

723
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,640
 No more information given.

724
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,480
 - Brilliant, they need it.

725
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,240
 - The thing that you have always done for hiccups,

726
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,320
 since I was Tony, is you drink some water upside down.

727
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,880
 - Yeah, all of that stuff is rubbish.

728
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,720
 - No, it works.

729
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,560
 - No, it doesn't, Andy.

730
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,400
 - It's just a distraction technique.

731
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,240
 - It works for me.

732
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,080
 - It works for me.

733
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,320
 - No, it doesn't.

734
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,400
 - You're still hiccuping.

735
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,480
 (all laughing)

736
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,320
 You've been doing it all day.

737
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,140
 - I'm not.

738
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:35,440
 - My headline fact this week,

739
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,960
 is from Jeffrey Partica, or Partica, or Party car.

740
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,880
 - Party car, yeah.

741
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,200
 - Party car, yeah, it's Party car.

742
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,400
 - Remember when we went to Dublin

743
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,640
 and we got in a party car?

744
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,480
 - Yeah, that was great.

745
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,320
 - That was cool.

746
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,160
 - The taxi.

747
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,000
 - Unintentionally, we got in a--

748
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,840
 - I did not remember that.

749
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,320
 - We got a taxi home from a gig,

750
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,320
 and then the guy just pressed a button,

751
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,800
 and all the lights started going off,

752
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,040
 and there was like a disco ball,

753
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,080
 and they started playing music.

754
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,480
 - It just went thundersly disco.

755
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,160
 - They always do that in taxis for me.

756
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,000
 - It's very cool.

757
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 - All right, one of you don't remember, yeah.

758
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,280
 - Electric eels are not a type of eel.

759
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,120
 - Are they not?

760
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:07,960
 - No, they're not.

761
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,800
 - I don't assume they were.

762
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,800
 - They're just an electric fish that's very long.

763
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,520
 But I thought I'd read about them anyway.

764
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,440
 There's this absolutely hero called Ken Katania,

765
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,400
 who's worked out what it feels like

766
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,200
 to be attacked by an electric eel,

767
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,720
 and he says that being attacked by a large electric eel

768
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,960
 is like being tasered by nine tasers at the same time.

769
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,240
 Well, what he did was he stuck his arm into a tank

770
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,680
 with a small eel, and did it 10 times,

771
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,400
 and he reckons because he knows how electric eels work,

772
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,680
 you could just extrapolate from the small eel

773
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,480
 to the size of a normal eel.

774
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,760
 So if you get bitten by a small electric eel,

775
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,480
 it's about the same as touching a horse fence.

776
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,080
 So do you know what that's like?

777
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,240
 - I do, actually, yeah.

778
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,640
 - 'Cause you like to steal horses, don't you?

779
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,080
 - I don't know, I used to raise on the podcast,

780
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,320
 but yeah, I'm a horse wrestler.

781
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,600
 - You've touched an electrified horse fence.

782
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,200
 - Yeah, well, 'cause you know, when you're a kid,

783
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,000
 we used to line up, so one of you touches the fence,

784
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,960
 and then everyone holds onto the other one's shoulders,

785
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,800
 and then you--

786
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,200
 - Okay, so it's a bit of a shock, it's not a, yeah.

787
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,240
 - It's quite a shock.

788
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,720
 - Hang on, if you're holding it normally,

789
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,120
 does it not shock you at all,

790
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,640
 because you're earthed with your rubber shoes and rubber?

791
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,080
 - The earthing is the problem, right?

792
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,360
 'Cause it goes through your body together.

793
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,200
 - Oh, sorry.

794
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,080
 So you're not wearing your big wellies at this point?

795
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,360
 - No, no, the whole point is to shock you

796
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,880
 and all your friends in a line.

797
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,960
 - Anyway, electrical is worse, he says,

798
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,280
 but he hasn't actually had the balls

799
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,520
 to sting himself with a proper big one.

800
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,400
 - No, because actually, if you're tazored by nine tazers,

801
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,520
 you're probably gonna die.

802
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,360
 - Yeah.

803
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,720
 - No, not a good idea, very not.

804
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,840
 (laughing)

805
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,640
 - And one interesting thing is that they use their electricity

806
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,200
 for electro-location, so they can, a bit like Sonar,

807
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,520
 they can kind of fire their electric field around

808
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,880
 and then feel where everything is.

809
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,920
 So, 'cause it's so dark and muddy down there,

810
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,040
 that's how they can see where everything is.

811
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:51,080
 But the sensors that they use, it's not exactly the same,

812
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,120
 but it's very, very similar principles

813
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,480
 to how your mobile phone works.

814
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,440
 So you know how there's sensors in there

815
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,480
 that kind of can tell that your finger's there

816
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,480
 and it's all about capacitors and blah, blah, blah.

817
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,480
 I'm not gonna go into it now,

818
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,760
 but it's basically the same technology

819
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,840
 as electric heels use to find their way around.

820
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,880
 - You see, you've got all your clever computers

821
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,520
 and all your internets in the old days.

822
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,520
 We got around just with eel tech.

823
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,080
 (laughing)

824
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,520
 And we jelly 'em up at the end of the day

825
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,060
 and it was absolutely horrible.

826
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,320
 (laughing)

827
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,240
 - Isn't it weird that when you have a vasectomy

828
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,000
 and then you produce semen,

829
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,240
 what would you think that looks like?

830
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,880
 'Cause you know when you think about, you picture semen.

831
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,720
 - Yeah.

832
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,560
 - And you think that that's--

833
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,760
 - I can't picture anything in my head,

834
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,080
 but I'm not even gonna try this one.

835
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,600
 - It probably looks absolutely identical.

836
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,880
 Yeah, maybe, or just a bit more watery.

837
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,000
 - That's what I would have thought it looks more watery

838
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,040
 'cause it looks more transparent maybe.

839
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,960
 - Maybe it doesn't have those green bits.

840
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,200
 (laughing)

841
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:55,600
 - We've still got the chunky cheesy bits, right?

842
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,920
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

843
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,680
 (laughing)

844
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,880
 It's a different chew they need to cut, James.

845
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,320
 - I thought it doesn't sparkle.

846
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,200
 (laughing)

847
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,040
 - Well, in a way, it doesn't sparkle.

848
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:07,880
 - It doesn't sing.

849
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,400
 It doesn't make that weird singing sound.

850
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,160
 (laughing)

851
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:15,080
 - It's just from screaming as they go.

852
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:15,920
 - Don't do it!

853
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,760
 - You're on it!

854
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,200
 (laughing)

855
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,920
 - I go to Valhalla!

856
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,200
 We will fight them on the beach.

857
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,040
 - So Anna--

858
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:23,880
 - This hasn't got more I wanted to.

859
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,720
 It's just the same.

860
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,040
 - Where did you want it to go?

861
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,040
 Where on earth did you want that to go?

862
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,620
 (upbeat music)

863
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:34,320
 - Okey-dokey.

864
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,240
 Hope you enjoyed that compilation.

865
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,360
 If you wanna get in contact with any of us

866
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,120
 about the things that we said on this episode,

867
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,140
 why not write to us?

868
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:44,640
 At podcast@qi.com.

869
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,240
 And we will cherry pick some of the best emails

870
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,960
 that you've sent in about this and the main episodes

871
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,780
 and use them in a future Drop Us Align episode.

872
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,560
 All right, Club Fish members, that is it.

873
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,400
 Take care.

874
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,360
 We will see you soon.

875
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,200
 Goodbye.

876
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,780
 (upbeat music)

877
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:03,360
