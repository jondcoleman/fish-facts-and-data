00:00:11,00:00:14,"all the best bits that didn't make it into the main episode,"
00:00:14,00:00:17,largely 'cause they just didn't fit the narrative.
00:00:17,00:00:18,"So, hope you enjoy it."
00:00:18,00:00:20,"But before we get to it, just a quick reminder,"

00:00:51,00:00:55,The best of the bits that didn't make it on with the show.
00:00:55,00:00:58,(upbeat music)
00:00:58,00:01:14,"- Hi, everybody, Andy here."
00:01:14,00:01:17,Welcome to an audience fact special episode
00:01:17,00:01:19,of No Such Thing as a Fish.
00:01:19,00:01:23,You have all been sending your facts to podcast@qi.com.
00:01:23,00:01:24,Is that the address?
00:01:24,00:01:25,- That's the address.
00:01:25,00:01:28,"That's what I say every week, so I hope so."
00:01:28,00:01:29,"- Well, they've been getting through,"
00:01:29,00:01:30,and they've been coming in thick and fast.
00:01:30,00:01:32,"And we've creamed off the ones on the top,"
00:01:32,00:01:33,and we're gonna be reading them out
00:01:33,00:01:36,and sharing them back with you now.
00:01:36,00:01:37,"- It's harder than it looks, isn't it, Andy?"
00:01:37,00:01:39,- It's a very difficult job.
00:01:39,00:01:41,"Damn, this is amazing."
00:01:41,00:01:41,(laughing)
00:01:41,00:01:43,- I'm happy to be here.
00:01:43,00:01:45,Do you wanna mention who else is here?
00:01:45,00:01:46,(laughing)
00:01:46,00:01:47,- Where are we as well?
00:01:47,00:01:49,And how often does this podcast go out?
00:01:49,00:01:50,- God.
00:01:50,00:01:53,- Can I tell you one last thing about the boss for us?
00:01:53,00:01:54,- Yeah.
00:01:54,00:01:56,- Constantinople and how it was defended.
00:01:56,00:01:58,There's one weakness in a naval sense.
00:01:58,00:02:01,There's a waterway which is calm and navigable.
00:02:01,00:02:03,"And basically, if you could sail your ships in there."
00:02:03,00:02:04,"- Oh, like a harbour."
00:02:04,00:02:05,"- Yeah, you could invade,"
00:02:05,00:02:07,and it would be incredibly easy to invade.
00:02:07,00:02:09,"So how did Constantinople, as it was then,"
00:02:09,00:02:10,solve this problem?
00:02:10,00:02:13,- Cannons.
00:02:13,00:02:14,- Great idea.
00:02:14,00:02:16,Arguably better than what they came up with.
00:02:16,00:02:19,(laughing)
00:02:19,00:02:20,- Crocodiles.
00:02:20,00:02:21,"- Crocodiles, good call."
00:02:21,00:02:22,- That's good.
00:02:22,00:02:24,- So I was going to tell you about the chain of the Golden Horn.
00:02:24,00:02:25,- Okay.
00:02:25,00:02:28,- They had a massive chain just across the water.
00:02:28,00:02:29,- Yeah.
00:02:29,00:02:31,- Like a rope barrier outside a nightclub.
00:02:31,00:02:33,- I thought didn't this work though?
00:02:33,00:02:35,"- Actually, I'm being unfair."
00:02:35,00:02:37,It worked better than you'd think it would.
00:02:37,00:02:38,It's about half a mile long.
00:02:38,00:02:39,- Okay.
00:02:39,00:02:40,"- Just this huge chain across the water,"
00:02:40,00:02:41,and then they can lower it
00:02:41,00:02:43,if someone approaches who's friendly.
00:02:43,00:02:44,And then what?
00:02:44,00:02:45,Joink it up again.
00:02:45,00:02:47,"- They were quite common, those things, I think."
00:02:47,00:02:48,- Okay.
00:02:48,00:02:50,"- Yeah, I've heard of them before."
00:02:50,00:02:51,I heard of one.
00:02:51,00:02:52,"This is in like British history,"
00:02:52,00:02:54,but there was one of them somewhere
00:02:54,00:02:56,where someone was in a boat
00:02:56,00:02:59,and they went in the boat towards this chain
00:02:59,00:03:00,and they're going to hit it.
00:03:00,00:03:02,And what happened was everyone on the boat
00:03:02,00:03:03,"ran to the back of the boat,"
00:03:03,00:03:05,so it lifted the front of it.
00:03:05,00:03:06,So they went over it
00:03:06,00:03:08,and then everyone ran to the front.
00:03:08,00:03:09,- Surely not.
00:03:09,00:03:12,That was like a heralded to story if I ever heard one.
00:03:12,00:03:13,"- I think it is a story,"
00:03:13,00:03:14,like I remember where it's from.
00:03:14,00:03:15,- It's good.
00:03:15,00:03:16,- That's great.
00:03:16,00:03:20,- There was a report in Scientific American in 1858
00:03:20,00:03:22,"about a healthy person called Mr. Gru,"
00:03:22,00:03:25,but he was born without a sternum or a breastbone.
00:03:25,00:03:28,And so you could see completely clearly his heart
00:03:28,00:03:30,and part of his lungs.
00:03:30,00:03:32,So it was just a thin layer of skin around it.
00:03:32,00:03:35,And so he'd be exhibited in theaters around Europe
00:03:35,00:03:36,for a few years and in lecture halls
00:03:36,00:03:38,because it really helped doctors know
00:03:38,00:03:40,about the structure of the heart and how it beat
00:03:40,00:03:43,'cause he'd literally stand at the front of a lecture hall
00:03:43,00:03:44,and you'd be sitting at the back
00:03:44,00:03:46,and you could see his heart boom-bombing
00:03:46,00:03:48,and bouncing out of his chest.
00:03:48,00:03:50,- 'Cause he didn't grew properly.
00:03:50,00:03:51,He was just--
00:03:51,00:03:52,"- Wow, good stuff."
00:03:52,00:03:53,Yeah.
00:03:53,00:03:55,- It wasn't Gru the name of the guy from Despicable Me.
00:03:55,00:03:56,"- Yeah, yes."
00:03:56,00:03:57,- And so did he have this?
00:03:57,00:03:59,And then he thought he was so exceptional
00:03:59,00:04:01,that he decided to take over the world with his minions.
00:04:01,00:04:02,- And that's what that's based on.
00:04:02,00:04:03,- Yes.
00:04:03,00:04:04,- There we go.
00:04:04,00:04:05,- What kind of full circle?
00:04:05,00:04:06,- Did he have ribs?
00:04:06,00:04:09,"And if so, where did they meet?"
00:04:09,00:04:11,- I think maybe the ribs didn't meet.
00:04:11,00:04:12,No breastbone.
00:04:12,00:04:13,- It feels like they wouldn't meet.
00:04:13,00:04:14,- Yeah.
00:04:14,00:04:15,- They just sort of stop.
00:04:15,00:04:15,- Big hole.
00:04:15,00:04:16,- It just floats.
00:04:16,00:04:17,That feels very painful.
00:04:17,00:04:18,- There are muscles between your ribs.
00:04:18,00:04:20,So it would stay in place.
00:04:20,00:04:21,- Right.
00:04:21,00:04:22,"- It wouldn't be good to like,"
00:04:22,00:04:24,my daughter likes to jump on my chest.
00:04:24,00:04:25,That wouldn't be great.
00:04:25,00:04:25,- Oh.
00:04:25,00:04:26,- You have to just limit that.
00:04:26,00:04:27,- Yeah.
00:04:27,00:04:28,"- And if he coughed or sneezed,"
00:04:28,00:04:30,then his lung really bounced out of his chest.
00:04:30,00:04:32,You really see it as long.
00:04:32,00:04:35,"- And if he really fancied someone like Jessica Rabbit,"
00:04:35,00:04:39,walking past his heart really pumped out of his chest.
00:04:39,00:04:41,- There was actually a really sad study
00:04:41,00:04:43,about which bits of their lives people would skip.
00:04:43,00:04:45,Like if they could say skip ahead five minutes
00:04:45,00:04:45,for about 10 minutes.
00:04:45,00:04:48,I've found that people would skip a huge proportion of it.
00:04:48,00:04:51,"Obviously, 'cause most of your life is just drudgery."
00:04:51,00:04:54,"Like if we could skip to the end of this guys,"
00:04:54,00:04:55,"we wouldn't, wouldn't we?"
00:04:55,00:04:58,"- Well, people listening could just fast forward to the answer."
00:04:58,00:04:59,- If only we could.
00:04:59,00:05:02,- Accessory breasts.
00:05:02,00:05:03,That's another thing.
00:05:03,00:05:04,- Accessory.
00:05:04,00:05:05,- Okay.
00:05:05,00:05:08,"So you know the classic total recall three boobed lady,"
00:05:08,00:05:10,three boobs is a thing.
00:05:10,00:05:11,"But like Andy's saying,"
00:05:11,00:05:13,you might not know where to find it.
00:05:13,00:05:16,So it's quite possible that you have three lactating breasts.
00:05:16,00:05:18,"But in the image that I saw,"
00:05:18,00:05:20,"which to be fair was a drawing,"
00:05:20,00:05:22,a lady was breastfeeding her child
00:05:22,00:05:25,and then thigh feeding her other child
00:05:25,00:05:27,because the breast had criss.
00:05:27,00:05:28,- Was this something real?
00:05:28,00:05:29,- Yeah.
00:05:29,00:05:30,- This isn't from one of your manga.
00:05:30,00:05:33,(all laughing)
00:05:33,00:05:36,- That's collection of erotic manga
00:05:36,00:05:39,is unparalleled in this hemisphere.
00:05:40,00:05:43,- Saint Jerome was a famous translator.
00:05:43,00:05:44,- Really?
00:05:44,00:05:46,- Not through like audio.
00:05:46,00:05:50,He would translate the Bible into the Vulgate.
00:05:50,00:05:54,And what he did was he took the sort of Hebrew Bible
00:05:54,00:05:55,"and then he put it into Latin,"
00:05:55,00:05:58,but he'd put it into a way that everyone could understand.
00:05:58,00:05:59,"So he put, he changed some of the words"
00:05:59,00:06:00,that maybe he shouldn't have done.
00:06:00,00:06:05,"So there was a, in fact, a Greek word, which was Maschia,"
00:06:05,00:06:08,which meant like Messiah.
00:06:08,00:06:10,"And he changed it to Christos,"
00:06:10,00:06:11,meaning anointed.
00:06:11,00:06:15,But actually the more reasonable way of translating that
00:06:15,00:06:18,"would be unctus, meaning anointed."
00:06:18,00:06:20,"And that is why we call Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ,"
00:06:20,00:06:22,because of that translation.
00:06:22,00:06:23,"- Oh, wow."
00:06:23,00:06:24,So we should call him unctus.
00:06:24,00:06:25,- Jesus unct.
00:06:25,00:06:26,- Jesus unct.
00:06:26,00:06:27,Yeah.
00:06:27,00:06:28,Unctiano Ronaldo.
00:06:28,00:06:29,- What's that doing?
00:06:29,00:06:30,"- It should be like,"
00:06:30,00:06:32,anyone called Christian or anything like that
00:06:32,00:06:34,"should be unctiano, really."
00:06:34,00:06:34,- That's so funny.
00:06:34,00:06:36,- He is quite an oily man.
00:06:36,00:06:37,"- Well, exactly."
00:06:37,00:06:40,- But isn't it amazing like one little bit of translation
00:06:40,00:06:42,can change so much in history?
00:06:42,00:06:44,"- That's where we get Christopher from as well, isn't it?"
00:06:44,00:06:45,"- Yeah, Christian and everything."
00:06:45,00:06:47,"- No, unctophosan, for example."
00:06:47,00:06:50,(both laughing)
00:06:50,00:06:51,- Unctophosan.
00:06:51,00:06:54,- The only thing I know about Saint Jerome
00:06:54,00:06:56,"is that he apparently told,"
00:06:56,00:06:59,"I think this is in the realms of maybe true,"
00:06:59,00:07:00,maybe not be true.
00:07:00,00:07:02,He told nuns not to eat beans
00:07:02,00:07:05,because he thought the flatulence that they would produce
00:07:05,00:07:08,"is so close to their front, bottom,"
00:07:08,00:07:12,that they might induce orgasms accidentally
00:07:12,00:07:14,off the tickling sensation of the fart.
00:07:14,00:07:18,"So he said, ""Tony beans, nuns."""
00:07:18,00:07:20,And he went back to translating the Bible.
00:07:20,00:07:23,(both laughing)
00:07:23,00:07:25,- There's a story told by John Sessions on QI
00:07:25,00:07:27,in one of the early series that you guys might remember
00:07:27,00:07:29,which I always love.
00:07:29,00:07:30,"And I actually don't know,"
00:07:30,00:07:31,"I think his source would have been,"
00:07:31,00:07:32,he's been told by someone else
00:07:32,00:07:34,"who was told by Gandhi himself, probably."
00:07:34,00:07:35,That's what I'm assuming.
00:07:35,00:07:39,"But basically in the scene,"
00:07:39,00:07:41,"so there are 300,000 extras, as you say,"
00:07:41,00:07:43,and Richard Attenborough's the director.
00:07:43,00:07:46,And the person who's organizing all the extras
00:07:46,00:07:48,in the whole scene is this other guy called David Tomlin
00:07:48,00:07:50,who's overseeing this funeral scene.
00:07:50,00:07:54,"So Gandhi's just died and Attenborough says to Tomlin,"
00:07:54,00:07:57,"""You've got to tell these 300,000 extras"
00:07:57,00:07:58,"how they're gonna behave."""
00:07:58,00:08:01,"And Gandhi's just died, the hero,"
00:08:01,00:08:03,like the ultimate icon of their country.
00:08:03,00:08:05,This is the worst news they've ever heard.
00:08:05,00:08:07,"They're devastated, their lives have fallen apart"
00:08:07,00:08:08,before their very eyes.
00:08:08,00:08:12,Can you possibly convey to them how they have to act?
00:08:12,00:08:13,So David Tomlin just turned around to this crowd
00:08:13,00:08:16,"and said, ""Right, listen up, Gandhi's dead"
00:08:16,00:08:17,"and you're all fucking sad."""
00:08:17,00:08:20,(both laughing)
00:08:20,00:08:21,- Wow.
00:08:21,00:08:21,"- Yeah, it works."
00:08:21,00:08:23,- That's very good.
00:08:23,00:08:24,"- So there are three bridges now,"
00:08:24,00:08:26,I think spanning the Bosphorus
00:08:26,00:08:28,and built at various different times.
00:08:28,00:08:32,"But the 1973 one, the first one was the Game Changer."
00:08:32,00:08:36,"In 1960s, you had to wait two and a half hours to cross,"
00:08:36,00:08:39,"I think by car, but it was just so clogged."
00:08:39,00:08:40,"And then for vans and lorries,"
00:08:40,00:08:43,it was days you had to wait to cross by boat
00:08:43,00:08:44,before the bridges happened.
00:08:44,00:08:45,- Oh yeah.
00:08:45,00:08:48,"- And I listened to this amazing interview with Harvey Binney,"
00:08:48,00:08:50,"who's one of the architects, British guy."
00:08:50,00:08:52,"He's retired now obviously, because it was a long time ago."
00:08:52,00:08:54,And he was interviewed by the BBC
00:08:54,00:08:56,"and here's a good riddle, me this."
00:08:56,00:08:57,"- Oh, hey, go on."
00:08:57,00:09:01,"- The distance between the tops of the two towers,"
00:09:01,00:09:03,'cause it's a suspension bridge.
00:09:03,00:09:05,"It's got two towers spanning the middle of it,"
00:09:05,00:09:07,is different at the top and at the bottom.
00:09:07,00:09:10,"Riddle me this, the..."
00:09:10,00:09:11,"- Sorry, so as in you take the top"
00:09:11,00:09:13,and then you go straight down that pole to the bottom.
00:09:13,00:09:15,- But those towers are not straight.
00:09:15,00:09:16,"- Well, they are straight."
00:09:16,00:09:17,- Oh.
00:09:17,00:09:18,- Or is it the curvature of the earth?
00:09:18,00:09:20,- The earth is not straight.
00:09:20,00:09:21,"- That was right, what I said."
00:09:21,00:09:22,- Yeah.
00:09:22,00:09:25,"- Because they had to build both towers absolutely straight,"
00:09:25,00:09:27,but it's such a distance apart
00:09:27,00:09:28,"that if you build them both straight,"
00:09:28,00:09:30,the curvature of the earth comes into play.
00:09:30,00:09:32,And it's about 10 centimetres different at the top.
00:09:32,00:09:32,- Who's it?
00:09:32,00:09:34,"- And he said, look, we did have to take that into account"
00:09:34,00:09:37,because you don't want to end up with like 10 centimetres.
00:09:37,00:09:39,You don't want to miss 10 centimetres of cable.
00:09:39,00:09:41,"- It's long, but it's not that long."
00:09:41,00:09:43,"- The earth doesn't feel that curved, does it?"
00:09:43,00:09:46,"- I know, the earth is more curved than you'd think."
00:09:46,00:09:48,- The earth is a lot more curved than dad thinks.
00:09:48,00:09:49,- Hell yeah.
00:09:49,00:09:52,(all laughing)
00:09:52,00:09:54,"- Only joking, I'll need that."
00:09:54,00:09:56,- We're just constantly losing giant containers
00:09:56,00:09:57,off the back of sherps.
00:09:57,00:09:58,- Why don't they pick it?
00:09:58,00:10:00,- You'd want to fish them out and see what's in each one.
00:10:00,00:10:01,"- You would, right?"
00:10:01,00:10:02,"- It could be a container of baked beans,"
00:10:02,00:10:03,a container of Barbies.
00:10:03,00:10:06,- That is a fun format for a TV show.
00:10:06,00:10:07,"- How does it work, sorry?"
00:10:07,00:10:08,- They already do this.
00:10:08,00:10:11,"- Well, it's a team of celebrities."
00:10:11,00:10:13,"- But there is one of these that exists,"
00:10:13,00:10:14,"but it's on land, right?"
00:10:14,00:10:16,Where you go into containers and you open them much.
00:10:16,00:10:17,"- That's it, it's an American show."
00:10:17,00:10:19,"And you get like, you take an old container unit"
00:10:19,00:10:21,that's not been claimed.
00:10:21,00:10:22,Or it's like--
00:10:22,00:10:23,"- It's run out, they've paid their rent."
00:10:23,00:10:25,"- Yeah, that doesn't download for this show."
00:10:25,00:10:27,"- And a load of experts can look inside,"
00:10:27,00:10:29,"but they can't go in, they can't open anything up."
00:10:29,00:10:31,So you just have to bid an amount for it
00:10:31,00:10:32,based on what you think might be in there.
00:10:32,00:10:34,"- Yeah, what is it called, you've told me."
00:10:34,00:10:36,"- Nothing wrong with liking a really good show, you know?"
00:10:36,00:10:37,- It's called Storage Wars.
00:10:37,00:10:38,- Storage Wars.
00:10:38,00:10:40,- Can I just say if the producers of Storage Wars
00:10:40,00:10:43,"are listening and they want a celebrity to come on,"
00:10:43,00:10:44,then Dan is available.
00:10:44,00:10:45,- I am available.
00:10:45,00:10:46,"- It's more outlandish, isn't it?"
00:10:46,00:10:47,I'll send you in this little rowing boat
00:10:47,00:10:50,to the middle of Pacific Ocean to find a container.
00:10:50,00:10:53,- The thing about heartbeats is
00:10:53,00:10:56,some people can hear their own heartbeats
00:10:56,00:10:59,"better than others, and this is called entereception."
00:10:59,00:11:02,And it's the ability to interpret signals
00:11:02,00:11:04,"from inside your body, so."
00:11:04,00:11:06,- I'm so hoping you don't say this means
00:11:06,00:11:07,they're gonna die prematurely
00:11:07,00:11:09,because I hear my heartbeats so loudly all the time.
00:11:09,00:11:13,- You're more likely to report having anxiety
00:11:13,00:11:16,"if you do that, and you're more likely to,"
00:11:16,00:11:18,"if your heartbeat changes slightly,"
00:11:18,00:11:20,"to think it's something to be worried about,"
00:11:20,00:11:22,whereas actually normally people's heartbeats
00:11:22,00:11:25,do change quite a lot throughout the course of a day.
00:11:26,00:11:29,And actually the best thing is to have a medium.
00:11:29,00:11:30,"You wanna sometimes hear it a little bit,"
00:11:30,00:11:33,"but not be obsessed with it, basically."
00:11:33,00:11:36,"- So are you concerned about it sometimes, Anna?"
00:11:36,00:11:37,"- No, I don't get concerned."
00:11:37,00:11:38,"I just, it keeps me awake."
00:11:38,00:11:39,"Sometimes 'cause you lie down on your pillow,"
00:11:39,00:11:40,you can always hear it in your ear.
00:11:40,00:11:41,"- So do you, yeah, do you hear it internally"
00:11:41,00:11:43,or can you hear it outwardly?
00:11:43,00:11:44,- Hear it out?
00:11:44,00:11:46,"What, like, hear it before you get to my shirt?"
00:11:46,00:11:47,"- Yeah, can you, no."
00:11:47,00:11:49,"That's physically, I mean, can you hear the noise?"
00:11:49,00:11:51,"- You're not a cartoon character, Anna."
00:11:51,00:11:53,Could your husband hear the noise
00:11:53,00:11:55,or is it through your inner ear?
00:11:55,00:11:57,"- I've never asked him, but I snore so loudly"
00:11:57,00:11:59,that I think it would cover up any noise I'm making.
00:11:59,00:12:01,- You're like the Telltale Heart by Edgar Ellingham.
00:12:01,00:12:02,"- Oh, yeah."
00:12:02,00:12:03,- You're like that your whole life.
00:12:03,00:12:04,- I am.
00:12:04,00:12:06,"Hang on, what does the heart tell?"
00:12:06,00:12:07,It beats and it tells someone.
00:12:07,00:12:08,- He's murdered someone.
00:12:08,00:12:10,- He's murdered the old man.
00:12:10,00:12:10,"Oh, it happens right away."
00:12:10,00:12:13,"It's sort of straight away, he kills the old man"
00:12:13,00:12:15,'cause he's got this weird eye.
00:12:15,00:12:16,The old man has a weird eye.
00:12:16,00:12:17,The guy hates that this old man has this weird eye
00:12:17,00:12:18,and he gets obsessed with it
00:12:18,00:12:20,"and he decides, ""Oh, am I gonna have to kill the old man?"""
00:12:20,00:12:22,"I mean, I think I just live in the same building"
00:12:22,00:12:25,"or something, it's always his landlord or something."
00:12:25,00:12:28,But he kills him and then he keeps hearing it.
00:12:28,00:12:29,He buries it under the floorboards
00:12:29,00:12:31,and he keeps hearing his heartbeat.
00:12:31,00:12:32,And some people come around to investigate.
00:12:32,00:12:34,We've heard there's been an old man murdered.
00:12:34,00:12:35,"Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom."
00:12:35,00:12:37,"He's like, ""Can you not hear that?"""
00:12:37,00:12:37,- No one else can hear it.
00:12:37,00:12:39,"- Like, ""No, no, Hannah's in the car now."""
00:12:39,00:12:41,(all laughing)
00:12:41,00:12:42,- I was actually looking up.
00:12:42,00:12:45,"'Cause I was thinking I like eel in Japanese restaurants,"
00:12:45,00:12:46,"which is the only context I've really had it,"
00:12:46,00:12:48,but obviously it used to be a huge thing.
00:12:48,00:12:50,You'd mostly in London and Cockneys
00:12:50,00:12:51,"and everyone ate Jelly Deal, right?"
00:12:51,00:12:54,You'd have pie mash and eel shops or whatever.
00:12:54,00:12:55,- That's right.
00:12:55,00:12:58,"- And I was wondering, was it nice?"
00:12:58,00:13:01,"And honestly, I've been through so many forums"
00:13:01,00:13:02,where people were reminiscing about eating it
00:13:02,00:13:06,and not a single person has said it wasn't disgusting.
00:13:06,00:13:08,"- And presumably if you're posting on those forums,"
00:13:08,00:13:10,you're a kind of nostalgia called buffer.
00:13:10,00:13:11,- Exactly.
00:13:11,00:13:13,- Like that I would think is the prime territory.
00:13:13,00:13:13,"- You're desperate to say,"
00:13:13,00:13:16,"""Oh, it was better in the good old days."""
00:13:16,00:13:18,And they all just had to know it was rank.
00:13:18,00:13:22,"I thought after Brexit, I thought we're gonna get it back."
00:13:22,00:13:23,- Did you?
00:13:23,00:13:24,"- I thought, yeah, that was the sunlit uplands"
00:13:24,00:13:25,that I was looking for.
00:13:25,00:13:27,"- That's what you voted for, wasn't it?"
00:13:27,00:13:28,- Bring back the Jelly Deals.
00:13:28,00:13:31,"- No, actually, Brexit has stuffed the eel thing."
00:13:31,00:13:31,- Oh no.
00:13:31,00:13:33,"- I'm so sorry, it has."
00:13:33,00:13:34,- Wasted boat jams.
00:13:34,00:13:36,- I'm sure you guys are familiar
00:13:36,00:13:38,with the Sustainable Eel Group.
00:13:38,00:13:41,"Basically, we used to ship 10 million eels a year to Europe."
00:13:41,00:13:43,"Legally, this isn't trafficked."
00:13:43,00:13:45,And more than half of that was for rewilding.
00:13:45,00:13:47,"'Cause if you get an eel swimming into the seven asteroid,"
00:13:47,00:13:48,"it's screwed, right?"
00:13:48,00:13:50,"It's like, it can't get up the seven asteroid tour"
00:13:50,00:13:51,but it's spawning ground.
00:13:51,00:13:52,The river is too blocked up.
00:13:52,00:13:54,But there are loads of places in Europe
00:13:54,00:13:56,"where you can introduce Neil, it'll swim up,"
00:13:56,00:13:59,"it'll find a cracking place to spawn, whatever."
00:13:59,00:14:01,And you've done a great job there.
00:14:01,00:14:03,"But Brexit has ruined it, so."
00:14:03,00:14:04,- 'Cause they can't fill in the paperwork and stuff.
00:14:04,00:14:05,- It's okay.
00:14:05,00:14:07,"Yeah, they can't fill in the paperwork."
00:14:07,00:14:09,'Cause it basically trade barriers.
00:14:09,00:14:11,"- Yeah, it's a bit of a pain."
00:14:11,00:14:13,- Does your heart really go bum-bum-bum?
00:14:13,00:14:15,Does it just go bum and you've just heard
00:14:15,00:14:16,the bum-bum in movies?
00:14:16,00:14:17,Or is it an echo?
00:14:17,00:14:19,Is the bum-bum-bum?
00:14:19,00:14:21,- If you've got a very hollow body.
00:14:21,00:14:22,- Yeah.
00:14:22,00:14:23,- For a hollow head.
00:14:23,00:14:24,- I'm just testing now.
00:14:24,00:14:25,- It does go bum-bum sometimes.
00:14:25,00:14:27,"I might be too very hard, I think."
00:14:27,00:14:28,"- I can only hear the,"
00:14:28,00:14:29,the moment I can only hear the bum.
00:14:29,00:14:30,- Yeah.
00:14:30,00:14:32,"- Well, you'll be using your pulse."
00:14:32,00:14:33,- Yeah.
00:14:33,00:14:34,- You're not listening to your.
00:14:34,00:14:35,"- But it's like, for instance, if you listen."
00:14:35,00:14:37,"- Wait, what do you think the heart is?"
00:14:37,00:14:39,"- Well, I think the heart,"
00:14:39,00:14:41,"the bum-bum I associate with heart, not with my pulse."
00:14:41,00:14:43,I know that you can feel the pulse.
00:14:43,00:14:45,"But you can't say, oh, I can hear my heart"
00:14:45,00:14:47,by touching your veins on your wrist.
00:14:47,00:14:47,- Yeah.
00:14:47,00:14:48,"- Okay, hang on."
00:14:48,00:14:49,"- This has all got a bit stoner,"
00:14:49,00:14:51,"but go on, James, bring it back."
00:14:51,00:14:52,"- Well, I doubt I will."
00:14:52,00:14:53,But it's like with a clock.
00:14:53,00:14:56,"You know, a clock ticks, but it doesn't talk."
00:14:56,00:14:58,"It just goes tick, tick, tick."
00:14:58,00:15:01,'Cause it's the same mechanism doing it all the time.
00:15:01,00:15:03,"But if you listen to it, you can almost hear a talk,"
00:15:03,00:15:04,even though there's not one there
00:15:04,00:15:05,because you're expecting it.
00:15:05,00:15:07,"- I was playing it cool by agreeing with you,"
00:15:07,00:15:09,but I absolutely thought there was a talk.
00:15:09,00:15:10,(laughing)
00:15:10,00:15:11,"- I thought in every clock,"
00:15:11,00:15:13,they'd entered two different tones just before.
00:15:13,00:15:14,"- I thought the pendulum, yeah,"
00:15:14,00:15:16,I assumed for years and years and years.
00:15:16,00:15:17,"When the pendulum goes one way,"
00:15:17,00:15:18,that makes a tick sound.
00:15:18,00:15:21,"And then, I don't know, inside the glass cabinet,"
00:15:21,00:15:22,there's something which makes it sound
00:15:22,00:15:24,a bit different going the other way.
00:15:24,00:15:26,- It's weird that you've still got that pendulum watch.
00:15:26,00:15:28,"- There is a different kind of eel,"
00:15:28,00:15:29,which does a similar-ish thing.
00:15:29,00:15:31,It's called a snake eel.
00:15:31,00:15:35,And they have a very pointy tip on their tail.
00:15:35,00:15:37,And they use it in a slightly different way.
00:15:37,00:15:40,"They use it just to power out of the stomach of the fish,"
00:15:40,00:15:41,which is eaten them sideways.
00:15:41,00:15:43,And then they just go out of the stomach.
00:15:43,00:15:44,"- Oh, like pierce it."
00:15:44,00:15:46,"- They just pierce it, they just go through."
00:15:46,00:15:47,"- Well, that sounds not very good for the fish."
00:15:47,00:15:48,"- Well, it's not good for anyone"
00:15:48,00:15:49,'cause they can't get through the rib cage
00:15:49,00:15:51,once they're through the stomach.
00:15:51,00:15:53,So they just end up stuck in there.
00:15:53,00:15:55,- That's like a blooper from the alien movies.
00:15:55,00:15:57,(laughing)
00:15:57,00:16:00,"The alien's like, ""I'm stuck, we're gonna have to do this again."""
00:16:00,00:16:02,"- Yeah, and the fish doesn't even notice."
00:16:02,00:16:06,Fish can cope with a lot of stuff.
00:16:06,00:16:08,- Something piercing a big hole in its stomach
00:16:08,00:16:10,and then landing up squirming around in its rib cage.
00:16:10,00:16:12,"I don't know whether they don't notice,"
00:16:12,00:16:14,but they definitely don't take any action.
00:16:14,00:16:15,- They play it cool.
00:16:15,00:16:16,"- They play it cool, yeah."
00:16:16,00:16:17,- Good on 'em.
00:16:17,00:16:20,"- You know, if you eat mussels as a human,"
00:16:20,00:16:22,you put them in the pot and it's boiling water.
00:16:22,00:16:24,"- Oh, yes, and they often come back out, don't they?"
00:16:24,00:16:25,Quite soon afterwards.
00:16:25,00:16:27,- But you're not supposed to eat the closed ones
00:16:27,00:16:28,'cause they might come out.
00:16:28,00:16:29,"Well, that is actually true."
00:16:29,00:16:33,"If you see an enemy, if you eat a mussel and it's closed,"
00:16:33,00:16:35,then the mussel can just go through your body
00:16:35,00:16:36,and come out the other end
00:16:36,00:16:37,and the mussel will still be fine.
00:16:37,00:16:38,"- Oh, really?"
00:16:38,00:16:39,- Yeah.
00:16:39,00:16:41,- Whereas normally what they'll do is
00:16:41,00:16:43,they'll bring in the mussel and the shell
00:16:43,00:16:45,"and then they'll eat the mussel and eject the shell,"
00:16:45,00:16:47,"but if it's closed, they can't get us the mussel."
00:16:47,00:16:50,"- Do the enemies, anemones, eat the whole thing"
00:16:50,00:16:52,and then just sort it out inside?
00:16:52,00:16:53,"- Yes, they do."
00:16:53,00:16:54,"- 'Cause that's a more dignified way of eating, I think."
00:16:54,00:16:55,- Yeah.
00:16:55,00:16:57,"- Now, if you could do that with a lobster."
00:16:57,00:16:58,- If you could do that with a Big Mac
00:16:58,00:17:01,"and you put in the entire, the burger"
00:17:01,00:17:04,"and the bit of plastic that comes, that goes around it."
00:17:04,00:17:05,- With the plastic on the cheese.
00:17:05,00:17:07,"- Or if you could, yeah."
00:17:07,00:17:08,(laughing)
00:17:08,00:17:11,Or if you could do it with a Kinder Egg
00:17:11,00:17:12,and then you could eat the whole thing
00:17:12,00:17:14,and you could even make the tie inside you.
00:17:14,00:17:15,- I love that.
00:17:15,00:17:16,(laughing)
00:17:16,00:17:17,Just open your mouth.
00:17:17,00:17:18,There's a little mechanical wiggle on there.
00:17:18,00:17:24,50% of eel consumed on the planet is eaten in Japan.
00:17:24,00:17:24,- It's big.
00:17:24,00:17:25,"- And if you go to a Japanese restaurant,"
00:17:25,00:17:28,"they'll always have, they have eel on the menu."
00:17:28,00:17:32,But the nice news is that 35% of Japanese people
00:17:32,00:17:33,are willing to eat cultured eel.
00:17:33,00:17:34,- As in--
00:17:34,00:17:35,- What eel that goes to the theater?
00:17:35,00:17:36,- That's right.
00:17:36,00:17:37,(laughing)
00:17:37,00:17:38,It costs more because obviously you've seen
00:17:38,00:17:40,"the prices of the restaurant these days, all right."
00:17:40,00:17:42,(laughing)
00:17:42,00:17:44,"No, you can, it's saffron-lay-miz."
00:17:44,00:17:45,(laughing)
00:17:45,00:17:46,It liked Hamilton.
00:17:46,00:17:47,It didn't love it.
00:17:47,00:17:48,"Like, it wasn't five stars."
00:17:48,00:17:52,"But no, it's like, you can grow really good eel now."
00:17:52,00:17:53,"You know, the art of it, like growing meats"
00:17:53,00:17:55,which are of different varieties.
00:17:55,00:17:57,The eel you can get now is really realistic.
00:17:57,00:17:58,- We're at like fake eel.
00:17:58,00:17:59,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:17:59,00:17:59,"- Oh, wow, really?"
00:17:59,00:18:01,"- It looks like it, it tastes like it, all of that, you know."
00:18:01,00:18:03,So that might be quite good.
00:18:03,00:18:05,- And how many Japanese people are willing to eat that?
00:18:05,00:18:06,- Over a third.
00:18:06,00:18:07,- That's good figures.
00:18:07,00:18:09,That's much better than like proportions of American people
00:18:09,00:18:10,who would be willing to eat fake meat.
00:18:10,00:18:11,I suspect culture meat.
00:18:11,00:18:14,"- Yeah, but we all say we're willing to eat kangaroo testicles"
00:18:14,00:18:15,until we're actually on.
00:18:15,00:18:16,I'm a celebrity to get me out of here.
00:18:16,00:18:17,(laughing)
00:18:17,00:18:21,"And then you don't want to, you're right, you're right."
00:18:21,00:18:24,"- Alfred Hitchcock was terrified of eggs, had ovo-phobia."
00:18:24,00:18:28,So he said the white round thing without any holes.
00:18:28,00:18:29,That's how he referred to eggs.
00:18:29,00:18:31,"And when you break it inside,"
00:18:31,00:18:35,there's that yellow thing round without any holes.
00:18:35,00:18:38,So I think he likes holes and he doesn't like eggs.
00:18:38,00:18:40,- Did he like ping pong balls?
00:18:40,00:18:41,"- Yeah, I don't know."
00:18:41,00:18:42,"He's no mention on ping pong balls,"
00:18:42,00:18:44,but what's interesting is his favorite breakfast
00:18:44,00:18:47,"was quiche lorraine, and he used to make it himself."
00:18:47,00:18:48,- What?
00:18:48,00:18:50,"- Yeah, so he would have to deal with this phobia"
00:18:50,00:18:53,"until the egg no longer resembled an egg,"
00:18:53,00:18:53,and then he was fine with it.
00:18:53,00:18:55,- Stick a hole in it.
00:18:55,00:18:56,"- Stick a hole in it, yeah."
00:18:56,00:18:58,- So that says to me it wasn't that serious.
00:18:58,00:19:00,Was it being still making his own quiche lorraine?
00:19:00,00:19:04,"- No, 'cause I think it's a sort of you face your fears"
00:19:04,00:19:06,and then it goes quite quickly once you get the fear.
00:19:06,00:19:08,"For him, it was the shape and the lack of holes."
00:19:08,00:19:09,"- No, no, I know, but if I like,"
00:19:09,00:19:10,"I don't like a house spider,"
00:19:10,00:19:14,and I can't just like go and kill a house spider really fast
00:19:14,00:19:15,"and be like, well, it was really quick,"
00:19:15,00:19:17,"so it doesn't matter, I can't go near it."
00:19:17,00:19:19,"- The other day Anna, a house spider fell on me"
00:19:19,00:19:23,as I was sitting up in bed from the ceiling.
00:19:23,00:19:23,And it was-
00:19:23,00:19:24,"- You told me this before,"
00:19:24,00:19:25,"I didn't enjoy the story at the time,"
00:19:25,00:19:26,I'm not enjoying it now.
00:19:26,00:19:27,"- It was a four inch, it was big."
00:19:27,00:19:28,- I don't like it.
00:19:28,00:19:29,- And I was shirtless.
00:19:29,00:19:31,"- That's not four inches, what's going on?"
00:19:31,00:19:34,(all laughing)
00:19:34,00:19:36,"So Lowell Bender writes,"
00:19:36,00:19:37,"""If you haven't already covered this,"
00:19:37,00:19:39,I'd like you to know that some US banks
00:19:39,00:19:41,"have their own zip code."""
00:19:41,00:19:43,"- Ah, nice. - It's cool, isn't it?"
00:19:43,00:19:44,"And then they write,"
00:19:44,00:19:47,"""I came across this because for reasons unknown to me,"
00:19:47,00:19:50,"meetup.com defaulted to that zip code,"
00:19:50,00:19:53,"but I'm in and then they give their own zip code."""
00:19:53,00:19:54,- Which is?
00:19:54,00:19:57,"- Well, this might be a call for help really."
00:19:57,00:19:58,"- Yeah, what's-"
00:19:58,00:19:59,- What's meetup.com?
00:19:59,00:20:01,"- Well, it sounds like a dating site."
00:20:01,00:20:02,"- It does, doesn't it?"
00:20:02,00:20:04,- And it then sounds like he's trying to give his address
00:20:04,00:20:07,"on the podcast, or she, or they."
00:20:07,00:20:10,So I wonder if this is just a trick
00:20:10,00:20:11,to try and get some fish lists.
00:20:11,00:20:12,"- Yeah, get some free meetups."
00:20:12,00:20:15,- Are we being cat-fished right now?
00:20:15,00:20:17,"- Wait, I'm so confused."
00:20:17,00:20:19,So this person went on a dating site
00:20:19,00:20:21,and ended up accidentally booking in a date with a bank.
00:20:21,00:20:23,(all laughing)
00:20:23,00:20:24,"Went to meet their date,"
00:20:24,00:20:27,"had put misleading pictures up of a not bank,"
00:20:27,00:20:28,and then arrived and it was a bank.
00:20:28,00:20:30,"- No, it's- - Come over and make a deposit."
00:20:30,00:20:32,- I bet the innuendo is going to be-
00:20:32,00:20:33,- What's the safe word?
00:20:33,00:20:34,There we go.
00:20:34,00:20:34,"- Yeah, there we go."
00:20:34,00:20:35,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:20:35,00:20:36,- Put 'em up.
00:20:36,00:20:38,(all laughing)
00:20:38,00:20:39,- This is a stick up.
00:20:39,00:20:42,(all laughing)
00:20:42,00:20:45,"- I make the same mistake every week when we do this,"
00:20:45,00:20:47,and then I go home and I get sushi
00:20:47,00:20:48,"for the thing next to the station,"
00:20:48,00:20:49,"you know, which comes with soy sauce and wasabi sauce,"
00:20:49,00:20:51,and it's always 'round the train.
00:20:51,00:20:53,So I squeeze in and then you have to get the chopsticks out
00:20:53,00:20:54,"and you have to open the soy sauce,"
00:20:54,00:20:57,and you have to open the sauce and it goes just everywhere.
00:20:57,00:20:59,- And you have to ask someone to hold your finger bowl
00:20:59,00:21:02,"and it's, you had to take your shoes off as well."
00:21:02,00:21:03,It's nightmare.
00:21:03,00:21:04,"- But you know when you started you're like,"
00:21:04,00:21:07,people will think I've given up if I don't keep going.
00:21:07,00:21:09,So I'm always covered in soy sauce and it stinks.
00:21:09,00:21:11,- I don't think people think about you that much.
00:21:11,00:21:12,"I don't mean to offend,"
00:21:12,00:21:14,but just most people are busy with their own stuff.
00:21:14,00:21:16,"They're not going to think that woman's only,"
00:21:16,00:21:18,that woman stopped eating her sushi halfway.
00:21:18,00:21:19,What's going on?
00:21:19,00:21:21,"- Is that top podcaster, Anna Tosinski,"
00:21:21,00:21:23,eating half a sushi?
00:21:23,00:21:25,"- She's quit, isn't she?"
00:21:25,00:21:27,She's too embarrassed to finish it.
00:21:27,00:21:29,- When's she going to eat the other half of it?
00:21:29,00:21:32,(all laughing)
00:21:32,00:21:33,- It's for her dinner.
00:21:33,00:21:34,"- Oh shit, I missed my stuff."
00:21:34,00:21:37,(all laughing)
00:21:37,00:21:37,- It was worth it.
00:21:37,00:21:38,It was worth it.
00:21:38,00:21:43,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:21:43,00:21:44,and that is Andy.
00:21:44,00:21:46,"My fact is that after Chernobyl,"
00:21:46,00:21:48,"nearby children were tweeted,"
00:21:48,00:21:51,"and they taught, they taught."
00:21:51,00:21:54,"Putty tat, oh dear."
00:21:54,00:21:55,- Good.
00:21:55,00:21:58,"- Someone sent us a tweet this morning, actually,"
00:21:58,00:22:01,"Sean Gibson, and it was referring to,"
00:22:01,00:22:04,it's just a headline from the Intelligencia Journal
00:22:04,00:22:06,"in Pennsylvania, from 1913."
00:22:06,00:22:09,Self-rising bed exceeds expectations
00:22:09,00:22:11,and throws inventor out of the window.
00:22:11,00:22:13,(all laughing)
00:22:13,00:22:15,No more information given.
00:22:15,00:22:17,"- Brilliant, they need it."
00:22:17,00:22:19,"- The thing that you have always done for hiccups,"
00:22:19,00:22:21,"since I was Tony, is you drink some water upside down."
00:22:21,00:22:22,"- Yeah, all of that stuff is rubbish."
00:22:22,00:22:23,"- No, it works."
00:22:23,00:22:24,"- No, it doesn't, Andy."
00:22:24,00:22:25,- It's just a distraction technique.
00:22:25,00:22:26,- It works for me.
00:22:26,00:22:27,- It works for me.
00:22:27,00:22:28,"- No, it doesn't."
00:22:28,00:22:29,- You're still hiccuping.
00:22:29,00:22:30,(all laughing)
00:22:30,00:22:31,You've been doing it all day.
00:22:31,00:22:32,- I'm not.
00:22:32,00:22:35,"- My headline fact this week,"
00:22:35,00:22:39,"is from Jeffrey Partica, or Partica, or Party car."
00:22:39,00:22:40,"- Party car, yeah."
00:22:40,00:22:42,"- Party car, yeah, it's Party car."
00:22:42,00:22:43,- Remember when we went to Dublin
00:22:43,00:22:44,and we got in a party car?
00:22:44,00:22:45,"- Yeah, that was great."
00:22:45,00:22:46,- That was cool.
00:22:46,00:22:47,- The taxi.
00:22:47,00:22:48,"- Unintentionally, we got in a--"
00:22:48,00:22:48,- I did not remember that.
00:22:48,00:22:50,"- We got a taxi home from a gig,"
00:22:50,00:22:52,"and then the guy just pressed a button,"
00:22:52,00:22:53,"and all the lights started going off,"
00:22:53,00:22:55,"and there was like a disco ball,"
00:22:55,00:22:56,and they started playing music.
00:22:56,00:22:57,- It just went thundersly disco.
00:22:57,00:22:59,- They always do that in taxis for me.
00:22:59,00:23:00,- It's very cool.
00:23:00,00:23:02,"- All right, one of you don't remember, yeah."
00:23:02,00:23:06,- Electric eels are not a type of eel.
00:23:06,00:23:07,- Are they not?
00:23:07,00:23:07,"- No, they're not."
00:23:07,00:23:08,- I don't assume they were.
00:23:08,00:23:10,- They're just an electric fish that's very long.
00:23:10,00:23:12,But I thought I'd read about them anyway.
00:23:12,00:23:15,"There's this absolutely hero called Ken Katania,"
00:23:15,00:23:17,who's worked out what it feels like
00:23:17,00:23:20,"to be attacked by an electric eel,"
00:23:20,00:23:23,and he says that being attacked by a large electric eel
00:23:23,00:23:26,is like being tasered by nine tasers at the same time.
00:23:26,00:23:30,"Well, what he did was he stuck his arm into a tank"
00:23:30,00:23:32,"with a small eel, and did it 10 times,"
00:23:32,00:23:35,"and he reckons because he knows how electric eels work,"
00:23:35,00:23:37,you could just extrapolate from the small eel
00:23:37,00:23:39,to the size of a normal eel.
00:23:39,00:23:42,"So if you get bitten by a small electric eel,"
00:23:42,00:23:45,it's about the same as touching a horse fence.
00:23:45,00:23:47,So do you know what that's like?
00:23:47,00:23:48,"- I do, actually, yeah."
00:23:48,00:23:50,"- 'Cause you like to steal horses, don't you?"
00:23:50,00:23:52,"- I don't know, I used to raise on the podcast,"
00:23:52,00:23:53,"but yeah, I'm a horse wrestler."
00:23:53,00:23:55,- You've touched an electrified horse fence.
00:23:55,00:23:57,"- Yeah, well, 'cause you know, when you're a kid,"
00:23:57,00:23:59,"we used to line up, so one of you touches the fence,"
00:23:59,00:24:00,"and then everyone holds onto the other one's shoulders,"
00:24:00,00:24:01,and then you--
00:24:01,00:24:03,"- Okay, so it's a bit of a shock, it's not a, yeah."
00:24:03,00:24:04,- It's quite a shock.
00:24:04,00:24:05,"- Hang on, if you're holding it normally,"
00:24:05,00:24:07,"does it not shock you at all,"
00:24:07,00:24:09,because you're earthed with your rubber shoes and rubber?
00:24:09,00:24:11,"- The earthing is the problem, right?"
00:24:11,00:24:12,'Cause it goes through your body together.
00:24:12,00:24:13,"- Oh, sorry."
00:24:13,00:24:15,So you're not wearing your big wellies at this point?
00:24:15,00:24:16,"- No, no, the whole point is to shock you"
00:24:16,00:24:17,and all your friends in a line.
00:24:17,00:24:19,"- Anyway, electrical is worse, he says,"
00:24:19,00:24:21,but he hasn't actually had the balls
00:24:21,00:24:23,to sting himself with a proper big one.
00:24:23,00:24:26,"- No, because actually, if you're tazored by nine tazers,"
00:24:26,00:24:27,you're probably gonna die.
00:24:27,00:24:28,- Yeah.
00:24:28,00:24:29,"- No, not a good idea, very not."
00:24:29,00:24:31,(laughing)
00:24:31,00:24:34,- And one interesting thing is that they use their electricity
00:24:34,00:24:38,"for electro-location, so they can, a bit like Sonar,"
00:24:38,00:24:40,they can kind of fire their electric field around
00:24:40,00:24:42,and then feel where everything is.
00:24:42,00:24:45,"So, 'cause it's so dark and muddy down there,"
00:24:45,00:24:48,that's how they can see where everything is.
00:24:48,00:24:51,"But the sensors that they use, it's not exactly the same,"
00:24:51,00:24:53,"but it's very, very similar principles"
00:24:53,00:24:55,to how your mobile phone works.
00:24:55,00:24:58,So you know how there's sensors in there
00:24:58,00:25:00,that kind of can tell that your finger's there
00:25:00,00:25:02,"and it's all about capacitors and blah, blah, blah."
00:25:02,00:25:03,"I'm not gonna go into it now,"
00:25:03,00:25:05,but it's basically the same technology
00:25:05,00:25:07,as electric heels use to find their way around.
00:25:07,00:25:09,"- You see, you've got all your clever computers"
00:25:09,00:25:11,and all your internets in the old days.
00:25:11,00:25:14,We got around just with eel tech.
00:25:14,00:25:16,(laughing)
00:25:16,00:25:17,And we jelly 'em up at the end of the day
00:25:17,00:25:20,and it was absolutely horrible.
00:25:20,00:25:22,(laughing)
00:25:22,00:25:26,- Isn't it weird that when you have a vasectomy
00:25:26,00:25:28,"and then you produce semen,"
00:25:28,00:25:29,what would you think that looks like?
00:25:29,00:25:31,"'Cause you know when you think about, you picture semen."
00:25:31,00:25:32,- Yeah.
00:25:32,00:25:33,- And you think that that's--
00:25:33,00:25:34,"- I can't picture anything in my head,"
00:25:34,00:25:37,but I'm not even gonna try this one.
00:25:37,00:25:38,- It probably looks absolutely identical.
00:25:38,00:25:40,"Yeah, maybe, or just a bit more watery."
00:25:40,00:25:43,- That's what I would have thought it looks more watery
00:25:43,00:25:45,'cause it looks more transparent maybe.
00:25:45,00:25:46,- Maybe it doesn't have those green bits.
00:25:46,00:25:49,(laughing)
00:25:49,00:25:55,"- We've still got the chunky cheesy bits, right?"
00:25:55,00:25:56,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:25:56,00:25:59,(laughing)
00:25:59,00:26:01,"It's a different chew they need to cut, James."
00:26:01,00:26:03,- I thought it doesn't sparkle.
00:26:03,00:26:05,(laughing)
00:26:05,00:26:07,"- Well, in a way, it doesn't sparkle."
00:26:07,00:26:07,- It doesn't sing.
00:26:07,00:26:09,It doesn't make that weird singing sound.
00:26:09,00:26:12,(laughing)
00:26:12,00:26:15,- It's just from screaming as they go.
00:26:15,00:26:15,- Don't do it!
00:26:15,00:26:16,- You're on it!
00:26:16,00:26:18,(laughing)
00:26:18,00:26:19,- I go to Valhalla!
00:26:19,00:26:22,We will fight them on the beach.
00:26:22,00:26:23,- So Anna--
00:26:23,00:26:23,- This hasn't got more I wanted to.
00:26:23,00:26:24,It's just the same.
00:26:24,00:26:26,- Where did you want it to go?
00:26:26,00:26:28,Where on earth did you want that to go?
00:26:28,00:26:30,(upbeat music)
00:26:30,00:26:34,- Okey-dokey.
