00:00:00,00:00:05,"Hi everyone, James here at Merry Christmas. This is our Christmas special and what it is,"
00:00:05,00:00:11,it's a compilation of all the best bits of the first half of our live TV show.
00:00:11,00:00:15,So what we did is we asked the audience to bring in their facts and we read them out and we
00:00:15,00:00:20,talked about them. Hopefully you'll enjoy it. The audio is a little bit sketchy because it's made
00:00:20,00:00:26,of five or six different episodes but we hope it's really good. And if you haven't got everyone
00:00:26,00:00:30,"there present yet then why not run out to the bookshop now and buy one, three, four, two,"
00:00:30,00:00:34,"cue our facts to leave you flabbergasted, a perfect stocking filler for that one person who you"
00:00:34,00:00:37,"can't think of anything else to buy them. Okay, on with the show."
00:00:37,00:00:51,[Music]
00:00:51,00:01:06,Please welcome to stage its anichesensky James Harkin and Andrew Hunter Murray. [Applause]
00:01:06,00:01:12,Hi everyone. So you guys have sent in your facts. We have a prize which is here which is one of our
00:01:12,00:01:20,no such thing as a fish t-shirt. Very exciting. And so we're going to read them out now. Do you
00:01:20,00:01:28,"guys want to start with one? Okay, what have I got? Oh yeah, I like this one so it's about"
00:01:29,00:01:37,"soon and now and it's from Alex. Hello, thank you very much Alex. Okay, so the fact is the word soon"
00:01:37,00:01:42,used to mean right now but people would misuse it and so it came to mean in a bit.
00:01:42,00:01:50,Because maybe people started saying soon to mean right now but then they were a bit delayed on their way
00:01:50,00:01:53,and so they got to the place and then someone said oh they must have meant in a bit.
00:01:53,00:01:59,"Yeah, that's how language it rolls. Can I read another one here? Yeah, yeah go ahead. I just read this and this"
00:01:59,00:02:06,"seems, well I actually don't believe it. So Karen, where are you? Karen's favourite fact."
00:02:06,00:02:11,"Karen, you better be right about this. According to Karen."
00:02:11,00:02:22,The numplate of the car in which Fransford and Ann was shot is the date that World War One ended.
00:02:22,00:02:30,"Do you know what that, how exact to date is 18 or is it literally 11/11/18?"
00:02:30,00:02:40,"I've got a picture of the car. Okay. And this is esusicsworldwarone.org.uk and it says, did you"
00:02:40,00:02:48,know the Arschteuk's number plate reads A111-118? So that could be 11/11/18.
00:02:48,00:02:55,"Karen, I take it all back. One thing I know about Fransford and Ann is that"
00:02:55,00:03:01,they used to sew him into his clothes. Oh really? And so when he was shot they couldn't really
00:03:01,00:03:07,loosen his clothes because obviously he was like sewn into them and that was perhaps one of
00:03:07,00:03:12,"the reasons why he died because they couldn't get the bullet out. Mainly the shooting thing, but"
00:03:13,00:03:21,that's not a layer 100% of the blame for the clothes. He was shot essentially by incredibly bad luck.
00:03:21,00:03:25,Wasn't here in the end because they missed him and then I think this is trying to get another
00:03:25,00:03:29,person I can't say. They missed him and then they gave up and all the people who'd plotted to
00:03:29,00:03:33,assassinate him were arrested and sent away except there's one guy who went to buy a bagel somewhere
00:03:33,00:03:39,else in town and he stepped out and I think he was holding a sandwich in one hand as Fransford and
00:03:39,00:03:46,and his wife went past the car broke down. Oh yeah. He stood there with the bagel and the car just
00:03:46,00:03:51,stopped because he thought that it was going in a completely different direction and then I'm
00:03:51,00:03:56,pretty sure there might be a historian in here. He then tried to kill himself. The bullet ricocheted
00:03:56,00:04:04,into Fransford and failed at about six times because he jumped into a river. So he jumped over a
00:04:04,00:04:08,bridge and he thought this will kill me. I'll drown. It didn't and the river was only about that
00:04:08,00:04:13,high so he ended up breaking his legs and he took a cyanide pill but it was old so he ended up
00:04:13,00:04:18,vomiting and then before the police got there all the locals got there and started beating him up.
00:04:18,00:04:23,He was soaked with broken legs with vomit coming out from a fake side by getting his ass kicked
00:04:23,00:04:28,"by locals. It was a terrible end to a- Was that one of the- I think I was one of the other guys,"
00:04:28,00:04:32,wasn't it? I was a kid. He was tied and failed. So the main guy needed to do the little principle.
00:04:32,00:04:38,Yes. I've been to that bridge actually and my memory is that that river was a bit deeper than
00:04:38,00:04:44,"that. Well, is it ready historians in? Who know that story? No? Okay, well we'll go with it then."
00:04:44,00:04:48,We'll believe it. And I go all that by the way from a Benelton novel so I'm not sure.
00:04:48,00:04:57,"And in that, Fransford has killed by a time traveller. So I've got one here from Harrison Fleming."
00:04:57,00:05:03,"Harrison Fleming. There we go. Australian bush rangers, brackets outlaws, would put their horses"
00:05:03,00:05:09,shoes on their horses backwards so that their traps would appear to be going in the opposite direction.
00:05:09,00:05:14,"Isn't that cool? And I like that because apparently that's what Yeti's doing. Oh, I knew you was going to say."
00:05:14,00:05:19,They take their feet off and they put them on the other way round. So when you think they've
00:05:19,00:05:24,"gone that way, they've busted loose that way. Yeah. And that's the only reason we've never seen"
00:05:24,00:05:29,"them, is that right? According to the park ranger, the Yeti Parky says they can turn themselves invisible."
00:05:32,00:05:37,That's the Yeti Parky and Brutal. Yes. Did you go to it? You've been to Brutal. I've been to Brutal but
00:05:37,00:05:44,"I didn't go to the Yeti Park. Maybe it did. Well, time for his country. Or has a happiness minister"
00:05:44,00:05:49,"doesn't it? Yeah. I mean, they show you round and you only see the bits that they want you to see."
00:05:49,00:05:54,So it seems like a very happy country. So maybe the happiness minister is just focusing on those parts
00:05:54,00:06:00,"for now. We did do this on the podcast but it got rejected which is that, according to Poland's"
00:06:00,00:06:06,"only officially registered ghost hunter, the ghosts in Poland are now going on strike. And the"
00:06:06,00:06:10,"reason they're going on strike is they're sick of our skepticism towards them. So they've said,"
00:06:10,00:06:14,"they said to him, if you're going to have that attitude, we're not going to bother haunting you"
00:06:14,00:06:21,"anymore. But isn't that a good... Oh, none of the crockery is broken. That's a good thing, isn't it?"
00:06:21,00:06:25,I don't know. The walls aren't covered in nectar plants.
00:06:27,00:06:30,Not for the ghost hunter. They'll have to start breeding them. Ghosts? Yeah.
00:06:30,00:06:31,There's not just killing people.
00:06:31,00:06:41,"So I've got a fact here from Emily and Alan, a joint effort for those guys."
00:06:41,00:06:45,"Hi. Is it just you's Emily, like on the other side of the room? If you had a bite,"
00:06:47,00:06:56,"and this is that, the US military bled AC/DC music at General Noriega's, who was a 1980s dictator in"
00:06:56,00:07:02,"Panamorsany, at General Noriega's compound in Panama for two days continuously to remove him,"
00:07:02,00:07:04,and he surrendered as a result.
00:07:04,00:07:08,"That's not fair. I think that's... Yeah, it depends which album you..."
00:07:08,00:07:15,"Now you won't believe this, but Andy knows every single AC/DC album and that's all he listens to at"
00:07:15,00:07:22,"the office. No, I've got six. I'll tell you what though, after the second one, they start getting"
00:07:22,00:07:29,"pretty repetitive. Let's do one more from your side too. Sure. Okay, well I have one here. It's"
00:07:29,00:07:35,"got a really nice picture on, so that's the reason I'm reading it, by Amy Eastpop. Oh, hello."
00:07:35,00:07:42,"It is that symptoms of the asthma can be treated with a rollercoaster ride, and there's a nice"
00:07:42,00:07:48,picture of someone on a rollercoaster. Those are rollercoasters and not pure gold stones as well.
00:07:48,00:07:53,"They said this way, yeah. Do they cure everything? So someone did a study... Kidney stones maybe."
00:07:53,00:08:00,"Yeah, they took fake kidneys onto rollercoasters, and they put stones into them, and then the stones"
00:08:00,00:08:03,"would kind of work their way out of these fake kidneys, and it happened more if you're at the back"
00:08:03,00:08:07,"of their rollercoaster than at the front. But doesn't it matter how they work their way out,"
00:08:07,00:08:12,because they haven't put a person who feels actual pain around the fake kidney? So if they're working
00:08:12,00:08:18,"their way out through your spinal cord, that is the viable solution to kidney stones."
00:08:18,00:08:23,"That's true. Shall we carry out? Yeah, you go. This is from Anna Martinez."
00:08:23,00:08:27,"Oh, hello Anna. And it's got a citation as well, which is why I like it."
00:08:27,00:08:38,"It's from nature, from May 2007, even the month. Viagra is excellent cure for jet lag in hamsters."
00:08:41,00:08:46,"Do they find that out by chance? Oh, he's been at the Viagra again."
00:08:46,00:08:53,He seems very perky. It's fine if I was flying back from Singapore.
00:08:53,00:09:00,"Wait, so I didn't know animals jet lag. Oh yeah, they do even plan skit jet lag."
00:09:00,00:09:04,Plan skit jet lag. I think they've tried it in bacteria jet lag. I've seen to remember.
00:09:04,00:09:11,"Yeah. What about rocks? Yeah. Anything else? Oh, I got a good fact. It's more of a quiz question."
00:09:12,00:09:17,"According to Steven Spielberg, this is just talking about plants and rocks and animals."
00:09:17,00:09:22,"According to Steven Spielberg, what is ET? Is he, so ET the extraterrestrial,"
00:09:22,00:09:29,"is he a plant, a rock, or an animal? I would just say an animal. A rock? He's a plant. He's a"
00:09:29,00:09:37,"bullet. He's a plant. He's a plant. He comes from a plant and his job is a biologist. Yeah, yeah,"
00:09:37,00:09:43,"because I read I read the sequel to ET, which is the story. I didn't read the actual book."
00:09:43,00:09:48,"I read the review on Amazon, which says, right at the end, it's written by William Cosnicol and"
00:09:48,00:09:54,"William Cosnicol wrote the original novel of the movie, so they're like the screen adapted novel."
00:09:54,00:09:59,"And the review ends by saying, I hope there's a future sequel in the trilogy of what should be"
00:09:59,00:10:05,a trilogy of ET because there were so many unanswered questions left at the end of this second book.
00:10:05,00:10:11,"For example, what happens to the turnip ship when it goes into the multi-dimensional wormhole?"
00:10:11,00:10:17,"So spoiler alert for the end of the novel ET part two. Okay, Anna, do you got one?"
00:10:17,00:10:23,"Yeah, so this is another one. This one's about Sean Connery. Sean Connery was once pulled over and"
00:10:23,00:10:29,"fined by a British officer for disaster speeding. It looks like speeding, but I assume speeding."
00:10:29,00:10:35,What are the odds? It would be the word species. It could be how Sean Connery pronounced his
00:10:35,00:10:45,"spitting was anyway. The officer's name was Sergeant James Bond. No. That didn't have a citation,"
00:10:45,00:10:51,"actually. All right, I got another one, which is that, so I'll read the facts and we can find out"
00:10:51,00:10:56,"who it is, who sent in an afterwards. Wolfsburg Football Club's longest-serving manager,"
00:10:56,00:11:02,what a slash is called Wolfgang Wolf. That's incredible.
00:11:02,00:11:07,It's very good. Who was that? What's your name? James. I know some of the funny football names.
00:11:07,00:11:10,"Yeah, yeah. There was one guy you played for Chelsea called Naughty, Naughty."
00:11:10,00:11:16,And do you remember that guy? He was a goalkeeper for Australia when England
00:11:16,00:11:24,beat Australia 8-1 or something. I think it was called Norman Conquest. I've got a football
00:11:24,00:11:28,"fact here, which is about a Swiss football team. I don't want to give it away. Who's it from?"
00:11:28,00:11:38,Michael. So this is the fact that Swiss football team young boys play at Wankdorf Stadium.
00:11:38,00:11:45,Very good fact. I've got another one here. This is from Katie Clark. Where are you Katie?
00:11:45,00:11:52,"OK. OK, so the flag that flies over Big Ben, over the houses of Parliament,"
00:11:52,00:12:01,is the same size as Wimbledon Centre Court. That's a big ass flag. That is huge.
00:12:01,00:12:05,You're not thinking table tennis. I was walking past it the other day and I did think
00:12:05,00:12:12,"what an unusually large flag it was. I genuinely did. And I was walking past Wimbledon thinking,"
00:12:12,00:12:22,"what a small tennis club. It's from Mark. Is it Mark? It's drawing. No fact, just a nice picture of you all."
00:12:22,00:12:32,Anyway. Mark's thought outside the box. It's an interesting choice for the fact to read out.
00:12:32,00:12:36,It's not that read out friendly. There's one person in a tie which is Dan. There's one with
00:12:36,00:12:43,big hair which is James. This one has got the woman's hair which is you. Completely neutral
00:12:43,00:12:56,stick bag. It's a really good lightness. I got a fact here. This is the reason that scuba divers
00:12:56,00:13:02,roll out of the boat backwards is that if they rolled forwards they would fall into the boat.
00:13:02,00:13:11,And that was sent in by two people.
00:13:11,00:13:22,Exact wording. Sam Brighton. Yeah. Sam Barton and Ellen Crane. Are you two together?
00:13:22,00:13:28,Oh okay. Two cheeky ones. All right. So I read out an actual fact.
00:13:28,00:13:34,Yeah. Okay. This is from Ben and it is that major league baseball umpires are required to
00:13:34,00:13:42,wear black underwear in case they turn their trousers. Oh. My favourite fact about baseball is about
00:13:42,00:13:47,Clarence Bleckin. Do you remember that one? He was sliding into fourth base once in 1920 and he
00:13:47,00:13:54,bit himself on his own ass. I think he had to be taken out of the game. You're going to have to explain
00:13:54,00:14:03,that. He was very flexible. He had false teeth and they fell out. I really like there was
00:14:03,00:14:09,"um Lou Garrig, very famous baseball player, more famous now so for the Lou Garrig's disease."
00:14:09,00:14:14,So I was reading a Stephen Hawking biography and at the top they mentioned Lou Garrig's disease
00:14:14,00:14:19,and then there's a little footnote that says recent research has shown that Lou Garrig didn't in fact
00:14:19,00:14:25,die from Lou Garrig's disease. He died from something very similar to Lou Garrig's disease.
00:14:25,00:14:30,So he's got a disease named after him that wasn't what he had. Just one more baseball.
00:14:30,00:14:35,Yeah. Yeah. See the Cubs have got to their major league to the um to the finals this time.
00:14:35,00:14:40,Oh you know the big deal isn't it? 75 years or something. But when I was reading about that I heard
00:14:40,00:14:47,about a guy called Joe Sprintz and in 1939 he tried to break the record for the highest that anyone
00:14:47,00:14:53,had dropped a baseball that he could catch it and so he got a blimp to go up 800 feet and they dropped
00:14:53,00:14:59,"a baseball down. He had a glove and it came down and it caught him in the glove, hit him in the face"
00:14:59,00:15:03,and it broke his nose and he lost five teeth. I'm worse still he dropped the ball.
00:15:03,00:15:13,So this is from David. It's about rocking chair. Oh hi um so this is that when the world's largest
00:15:13,00:15:17,rocking chair was built. It was immediately welded to the ground because the sight of it rocking
00:15:17,00:15:26,in the wind terrified the locals. Very good. That's amazing. Sorry next time. I've got one. Yep.
00:15:26,00:15:32,It's about Adam and who's that from? Oh what's your name? I'm Steven. Steven hello. So it's about
00:15:32,00:15:39,Adam and we all know Adam and don't we? Yeah music person? Yeah famed 80s music person Adam and
00:15:39,00:15:46,Adam and used to walk Paul McCartney's dog because Adam and his mum was his cleaner and he helped with
00:15:46,00:15:55,the dog walking. I go on here which is that the Kakapo parrot is an endangered species of parrot.
00:15:55,00:16:01,It evolved out of being able to fly so can't fly anymore. However they have forgotten that they
00:16:01,00:16:08,can't fly and that's true. They know that they can fly but they don't try it on the ground. They
00:16:08,00:16:14,climb up trees. They go to the end of branches and go I'll have my fly now and and they plummet to
00:16:14,00:16:19,the ground and it's killing them. Yeah they're endangered now so they're trying to stop them. They're
00:16:19,00:16:24,trying to go you can't fly and on top of that that's not on here but they also have this thing where
00:16:24,00:16:29,and this was in there's a very famous Douglas Adams book called Last Chance to See and he talks
00:16:29,00:16:33,about how Kakapo parrots have a mating call that when they when they do their mating call
00:16:33,00:16:39,it's really deep so deep it's kind of like the base of a stereo system so it's just this
00:16:39,00:16:43,kind of noise. Now the problem with the base of a stereo system is the point is if you put it in
00:16:43,00:16:48,your room no matter where it's playing from you can't find the source that's meant to be the the
00:16:48,00:16:54,idea of it surround sound. So their mating call gets them nowhere because the female parrot is like
00:16:54,00:17:01,where are and so she can never find the Kakapo. That reminds me a bit of do you remember that story
00:17:01,00:17:10,about lesbian sheep? So it's like the rape on a time story. No so and there are lesbian sheep and the
00:17:10,00:17:15,thing is if you're a female sheep and you want to mate what you do is you stand perfectly still and
00:17:15,00:17:20,wait for the male to come and mount you and so when you've got two lesbians sheep and they both
00:17:20,00:17:26,stand perfectly still and so the both kind of stood there looking at each other. Are you going to go
00:17:26,00:17:33,or am I? That's amazing. So that bird fact did anyone see the documentary this week which showed
00:17:33,00:17:37,that kind of seabird and I can't remember what it is it's like a little puffing that lives at the
00:17:37,00:17:42,top of a cliff and it rears they rear one young one youth every year and then as soon as the youth
00:17:42,00:17:47,is ready they push it off the cliff really really high and it has to stick its wings out and try to
00:17:47,00:17:53,hit the sea but the sea isn't directly below it the sea is about 150 meters away from the cliff.
00:17:53,00:17:58,And it's unbelievably far they're unbelievably high and there are loads of wolves waiting to
00:17:58,00:18:04,eat the sea and you're just most of them just they go they don't quite and they just do slow motion
00:18:04,00:18:08,filming are they going to make it a motion don't they hit the ground they tumble over and then
00:18:08,00:18:12,their wolves come out. Imagine being that wolf though that was pretty good. So if I'm just looking
00:18:12,00:18:18,up with your mouth. Anna have you got another one? Yeah sure and this is that switch one do I like
00:18:18,00:18:22,it. Okay I don't know who's the missing is I don't know anything about it but when the ancient
00:18:22,00:18:27,Romans deployed lions against Germanic tribes the tribesmen simply assumed they were large dogs.
00:18:27,00:18:31,I don't believe that. I always it feels like really an instinctive fear when you see it.
00:18:31,00:18:37,I can't imagine even if I'd never seen them going yeah it just looks like straight as panel it feels like
00:18:37,00:18:42,you probably would get scared of it the first time it turned you into a ghost you probably
00:18:45,00:18:52,Andy of you Andy? I do like this one John Lakeri's father once seduced a woman on a night train by
00:18:52,00:19:02,claiming to be John Lakeri. How do you pretend to be him though? We would have known all the relevant
00:19:02,00:19:09,stuff about his childhood I suppose. Yeah but you could just make that no one knows John Lakeri
00:19:09,00:19:13,well enough that they'd be like oh yeah I knew about his butterfly obsession when he like no one
00:19:13,00:19:20,knows anything he's a spy the guy's a spy. Here's another one in 1996 two neighbours in Devon
00:19:20,00:19:25,spent a year hooting at owls on a where they were actually hooting at each other.
00:19:25,00:19:38,I was really really good story yesterday about this is from like 10 years ago in Iceland there was
00:19:38,00:19:44,a lady who who was with this big party and she got changed she just went off and got changed and when
00:19:44,00:19:48,she got changed no one recognised her and thought that the woman that was she was before in the other
00:19:48,00:19:54,clothing had gone missing so they sent out a huge day-long search party in order to look for this
00:19:54,00:20:00,lady and the lady herself was in the search party going what did she look like again? Yeah I'll help
00:20:00,00:20:05,out and then they worked out it with her just some different clothing. Since you mentioned birds my
00:20:05,00:20:10,favourite thing about birds this week that came out is that they just found out that swifts can stay
00:20:10,00:20:17,in the air without touching the ground or a tree for ten whole months without touching down one
00:20:17,00:20:22,single time it's not incredible and we don't know how they're sleeping or eating but they're mating
00:20:22,00:20:26,and eating in the air aren't they? They are eating in the air are they mating? I thought it was pre-breeding
00:20:26,00:20:34,season and then maybe they do a little bit. Oh I think they do a bit. Yeah. Yeah we think they've
00:20:34,00:20:40,seen that they gain altitude at dusk at bedtime and we think maybe they do this so that then they
00:20:40,00:20:44,can go to sleep and then they just gradually descend and by morning when they wake up they just wake
00:20:44,00:20:48,up and time on to the ground. There may be sleep like on a cloud because that's quite fluffy.
00:20:48,00:21:00,Okay this is about a place in Canada called Church Hill. Who's this that from? Oh hello what's your name?
00:21:01,00:21:12,Clint? I'm going to call you Clint. Was it Clint? Clint? Clint? Clint? KLIM like that. Okay well
00:21:12,00:21:25,actually I've just noticed your name is on this. So this is from Clint and people in Church Hill
00:21:25,00:21:32,Canada leave their car doors unlocked in case neighbors need to make a quick escape from polar bears.
00:21:32,00:21:37,What? That's good that isn't it. I thought because people always say that people think how to leave
00:21:37,00:21:42,their house doors unlocked because they're so friendly. They're not friendly. That is terrified.
00:21:42,00:21:48,Another thing you don't get there is donuts right? Oh yeah. You still kind of do have some
00:21:48,00:21:53,donuts but if you make a new building in Vancouver you're not supposed to put donuts on it and that's
00:21:53,00:21:58,so that old people who've got arthritis will be able to use levers instead of knobs. Yeah? That's
00:21:58,00:22:07,or also polar bears will be able to use it. Okay this is a fact from Alex about oxymorons. It's that
00:22:07,00:22:15,oxy is Greek for sharp. Moron is Greek for dull. Oxymoron is an oxymoron.
00:22:18,00:22:28,That's pretty good. I can't really wouldn't know that. We got just on words. We got sent in because we
00:22:28,00:22:33,asked people on Twitter as well to send in some facts and I really like this. This is from someone
00:22:33,00:22:39,"called @StrayGym and you said during the 1914 Christmas truce, Germans put up a sign facing the"
00:22:39,00:22:45,British truce saying got mit unz. Effectively God with us. The British responded by erecting a
00:22:45,00:22:57,sign facing the Germans saying we got mit unz tool. How's it going nice? How do they get across the
00:22:57,00:23:06,slightly offensive German accent in sign form? We got a fact here about Fiji and their declaration of
00:23:06,00:23:13,independence. Who was that? Yeah what's your name? Joe. So this is Joe's fact. In 2010 Fiji lost their
00:23:13,00:23:23,declaration of independence and had to ask Britain for a photocopy. Let's do a few more.
00:23:23,00:23:29,Yeah so this is about pistachios. Is that your name? Or are you just a foul of pistachios?
00:23:29,00:23:36,Lucy. So this is a Lucy about pistachios and this is the fact that if too many pistachios are
00:23:36,00:23:44,"shipped in the same container, they will self eat and spontaneously combust. Is that true? Yeah,"
00:23:44,00:23:52,is it? Could we try it? Yeah. Do you remember ages ago? I said this on the podcast and then
00:23:52,00:23:55,everyone was like it can't be true and it's definitely true and then we found out it definitely
00:23:55,00:24:02,wasn't true. But I was told it by Ash. She's up there in the corner. Ash is the singer and composer
00:24:02,00:24:07,"of our theme tune. This is Emperor Yess, Wasp sash and he told me and I used it on the show. It's"
00:24:07,00:24:13,like that's amazing that when you're bringing sparkling water overseas from somewhere before you
00:24:13,00:24:19,"take the sparkling water into a boat, you have to remove all the bubbles because it'll explode"
00:24:19,00:24:23,on the other side or it will go un-fizzy. So what they do is they take out all the bubbles
00:24:23,00:24:28,and then they ship the water out and then on the other side they put the same bubbles back in.
00:24:30,00:24:33,It's the same. It's the fact that it's the same bubbles that makes it impossible.
00:24:33,00:24:40,"It's got to be the same ones. We've got bubbles. Yeah, and then I told Ash I was like after we found"
00:24:40,00:24:45,"out that it wasn't real, which like there's no even way to Google. It's not the same thing. I was"
00:24:45,00:24:50,"like, Ash, it's like that wasn't real and he was like, yeah, I know I found it wasn't real ages ago,"
00:24:50,00:24:57,"yeah. That was the same episode when you said that if you have water which you can't drink,"
00:24:57,00:25:01,you can feed it to a camel and it vomits it out and then it'll be completely drinkable.
00:25:01,00:25:09,"And I still stand behind that back. I'm pretty sure an explorer wrote into us and said,"
00:25:09,00:25:11,I'll do you mock at you. I wrote you. Are you wrote into it?
00:25:11,00:25:17,"I am an explorer of sorts. Yeah, I found in a book. It was like a 19th century explorer's book"
00:25:17,00:25:22,and he said a good way to treat dehydration is to drink the vomit of a camel. So I mean it was
00:25:22,00:25:26,obviously nonsense at the time but I think people have believed it for a while. I'd definitely
00:25:26,00:25:29,remember reading a reference. But that's for dehydration and not for poison.
00:25:29,00:25:32,"I'm no sorry it was about a sorry it was for poison. It was a toxin thing, yeah."
00:25:32,00:25:38,So it's the jury's out on whether if you dehydrated you should drink camel vomit. It's got liquid content.
00:25:38,00:25:40,Why are we all being so squeamish about this?
00:25:40,00:25:47,That fact actually reminds me of bees. I think bees air condition themselves by spitting inside
00:25:47,00:25:51,"of their hives, don't they? So that it creates like a nice bit of condensation which calls"
00:25:51,00:25:57,them down in summer. They spit on each other's faces to call each other. So why you've been doing
00:25:57,00:26:08,that to me? No. Okay. Turkey Vultures we down their own legs to call themselves Stone.
00:26:08,00:26:15,Which is why I've been doing that. This is actually sorry but you've mentioned Vultures. This is
00:26:15,00:26:20,one of my favourite facts I found on this series of QI we just research which is the reason the
00:26:20,00:26:24,"Vultures have their necks, they don't have fur on their necks is because it's quite hard for them"
00:26:24,00:26:28,to scavenge actually because it's quite hard to get into the body of a dead animal. So if there's
00:26:28,00:26:33,not an open wound then they find the easiest orifice to enter through and so they either go in through
00:26:33,00:26:38,the eyeballs of you know your dead deer all they just go straight up the arse and the reason
00:26:38,00:26:43,that they they have that little bear bit is so they don't pull their heads out covered in feces
00:26:43,00:26:50,from the animal that they've been scavenging inside. They do and they'll cover in feces but it doesn't
00:26:50,00:26:55,kind of stick there because they don't have all the feathers. Yeah yeah yeah it's easier to remove
00:26:55,00:27:01,just to clarify that. Wait so that's literally why they've evolved like that so they don't get the
00:27:01,00:27:05,rest of their body covered in shit but their head is... Well they don't usually need to crawl up
00:27:05,00:27:11,entirely inside the animal usually just the neck is enough. I know but it's just odd that they haven't
00:27:11,00:27:16,worked out how to eat something else so they've just thought well let's just lose all the feathers
00:27:16,00:27:24,here and then we can keep getting shit all over our heads. This is about German international
00:27:24,00:27:36,development agencies. Ah who is that? Joe hi Joe. I pretty much already read all of it. The German
00:27:36,00:27:46,international development agency is called Chiz. It's called GIZ and then Open brackets Giz.
00:27:46,00:27:55,Is GIZ that an acronym? Yeah but you you do call it Giz. Great.
00:27:55,00:28:05,Andy have you if you got one? Yes. Mine is also about German and about squirrels
00:28:06,00:28:13,anybody? Hello what's your name? Ed. Hello. Ed's back to his. The German word for squirrel literally
00:28:13,00:28:25,means oak croissant. Icon hind yeah can we get some verification from the back? No. They've left.
00:28:29,00:28:39,Citation needed I think. This one's about kangaroos and it's got a drawing on it. Is that ring a bell
00:28:39,00:28:43,with anybody? Hello. Oh right at the back. What's your name? Clint.
00:28:43,00:28:53,Lewis. There's facts from Lewis and it's I'm going to read it out verbatim. My fact is rubbish but I
00:28:53,00:29:00,didn't Google it. Brackets for shame on you Googlers. Then we get to the meter the master.
00:29:00,00:29:07,A kangaroo licks its arms to stay cool and then there's a drawing of a kangaroo
00:29:07,00:29:15,licking its arms. It's really good. That's great. Don't they pose with their biceps when they're
00:29:15,00:29:19,trying to pick up lady kangaroos? Yeah there's all these photos of kangaroos are like oh
00:29:19,00:29:25,do you want me to get that? Like genuinely bicep. That's sort of bodybuilding. They also very
00:29:25,00:29:32,famously have three vaginas don't they? Yes. Very famously within the QI office. It's not in the
00:29:32,00:29:39,Australian national anthem isn't it? Speaking of things which have three vaginas. No wait a minute
00:29:39,00:29:44,no. Are you going to say what I think you're going to say? I think I know. She doesn't have
00:29:44,00:29:49,three vaginas. No. But do you want us to you talk about it? So a kangaroo has three vaginas which
00:29:49,00:29:55,means it has two wombs because it has two extra kind of bits that go out to a womb and does anyone
00:29:55,00:30:00,know some body else who has two wombs? James found this out just today and he can't stop. I want
00:30:00,00:30:07,to use it. I wanted to use it for the show but they wouldn't let me. Mary Berry. Mary Berry has two
00:30:07,00:30:20,wombs. As two and three vaginas. That's no way to speak about Melonsou and Paul Hollywood.
