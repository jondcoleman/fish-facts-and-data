1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,500
 *singing*

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,000
 That didn't work at all, let's have the theme change.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 *music*

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 *music*

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 *cheering*

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 How are you?

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,500
 And welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast this week coming to you.

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,000
 From the "Up the Creek" comedy club in Greenwich.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,500
 My name is Dan Schreiber and please welcome to the stage.

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,500
 It's the three regulars Anichesinsky James Harkin and Andy Murray!

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:48,500
 *cheering*

12
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:53,500
 And once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

13
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,000
 and in no particular order, here we go.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,500
 Starting with you, James Harkin.

15
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:07,500
 Okay, my fact this week is that there is only a one in 800,000 chance that nobody will cough during this podcast recording.

16
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,500
 *laughter*

17
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,500
 How those odds are looking bad.

18
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:20,500
 Yeah, so there's a recent study done that I saw this on the improbable website.

19
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:31,500
 And it was by Professor Andreas Wagner from the University of Hanover and it was called "Why do people not cough in concerts, the economics of concerts etiquette?"

20
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:43,500
 And he basically found out the probability that a certain number of people would cough and I kind of extrapolated his data into the number of people who are here tonight and got it completely wrong.

21
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,500
 *laughter*

22
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,500
 I did huge genuine coughs, that was one.

23
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,500
 No, we put the idea in their minds now.

24
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,500
 Yeah, I have an unbearable urge to cough.

25
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,500
 *laughter*

26
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,500
 I'm not very suggestible, but...

27
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,500
 This could really have spiled the entire podcast.

28
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:06,500
 So I read a different report that suggested that people actively try to cough more when they go to classical concerts.

29
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,500
 Yeah, what?

30
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,500
 Yeah, they find themselves just wanting to...

31
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,500
 Well, I knew it. There's so annoying. Why are they doing that all the time?

32
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,500
 I don't know. I mean...

33
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,500
 Hang on, you haven't looked into what their motivation is.

34
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,500
 I was kind of hoping one of you guys had it. It was at the top of the Google search. I figured you guys agreed it.

35
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,500
 Well, luckily enough, I did look into that.

36
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,500
 Oh, yeah!

37
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,500
 *laughter*

38
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:33,500
 There's a few different thoughts. One is that you might be showing displeasure to the performance.

39
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,500
 And you'll think it's a bit like, "I'm not happy, I'm just going to cough in it."

40
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,500
 Yeah, a great bar show.

41
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,500
 *laughter*

42
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:48,500
 Oh my god. Yeah, and the other thing is maybe you are actively suppressing the idea that you're going to cough through most of it.

43
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,500
 And then suddenly you think, "Okay, this allowed bit, I can finally cough." And you would do it that way.

44
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,500
 Okay, people always do in the loud parts.

45
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,500
 Yeah.

46
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,500
 Yeah, yeah.

47
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,500
 *laughter*

48
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:05,500
 There's a guy called Robert R. Provein, who writes amazing studies on sneezing and yawning and on coughing.

49
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:12,500
 And he does all these studies on bits of human experience that don't get much scientific attention because they're not seen as important.

50
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:17,500
 And so he has studied lots and lots of people about coughing and he didn't experiment.

51
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,500
 He asked people to cough.

52
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,500
 So, on average, you can cough within 1.7 seconds if you're asked to.

53
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,500
 *laughter*

54
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,500
 Whereas if you're asked to sneeze on demand, most people can't do it.

55
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,500
 And if they can, the average time is 8.1 seconds to sum it up.

56
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:37,500
 Which I think is amazing that anyone can do that. In 8 seconds, it would take me ages to work up a sneeze.

57
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,500
 Yeah.

58
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,500
 Yeah.

59
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,500
 I used to have a friend that could vomit on command.

60
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,500
 It's true, it's true. Some people have this.

61
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:50,500
 And he would only need a tiny sip of something and then he'd go, "What?" and just yak up onto the street.

62
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,500
 It was amazing.

63
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,500
 It was extraordinary.

64
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,500
 What does he do these days?

65
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,500
 His Australia's got talent.

66
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,500
 *laughter*

67
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:04,500
 Do you know that? So, talking of sneezing and coughing, a cough leaves your mouth at 50 miles an hour.

68
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,500
 Which is quite fast.

69
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,500
 And I think it's, yeah, 3,000 droplets are expelled when you cough.

70
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,500
 So, one cough, 3,000 droplets are expelled.

71
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:19,500
 When you sneeze, it leaves your mouth at more than 200 miles an hour and more than 40,000 droplets are expelled from your mouth in one sneeze.

72
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,500
 Wow.

73
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,500
 How cool is that?

74
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,500
 How many miles in it?

75
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,500
 Two, more than 200 miles an hour for a sneeze, 50 for a cough, so it's way ahead.

76
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,500
 If you sneeze in a car that is going at 80 miles an hour...

77
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,500
 *laughter*

78
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,500
 I suppose technically that sneeze is going at 280 miles an hour.

79
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,500
 I feel like I need to explain relativity to you.

80
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,500
 No, I mean...

81
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,500
 No, it's not the time.

82
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,500
 So, people who are extremely bothered by coughing might have a thing called mesophonia.

83
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:53,500
 Which is, basically, it's a kind of thing where you're really bothered by any kind of noise.

84
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,500
 But coughing is one of them.

85
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,500
 Chewing food is another one.

86
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,500
 And...

87
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,500
 *laughter*

88
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,500
 We've got a few mesophones in tonight.

89
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,500
 *laughter*

90
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,500
 Mesophones.

91
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,500
 I think it's someone that sounds like a cough.

92
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,500
 *laughter*

93
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:14,500
 There's a 10-level scale of mesophonia and you can go online and see which one you are.

94
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:20,500
 Level 5 is when you cover your ears if someone's coughing or kind of chewing or whatever.

95
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,500
 Level 9 is consciously suppressing the desire to do harm to others.

96
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,500
 *laughter*

97
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,500
 And level 10 is actual violence.

98
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,500
 *laughter*

99
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,500
 Wow.

100
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,500
 Level 7, I found really interesting.

101
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,500
 It said in level 7, there was a few different things.

102
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,500
 And one of them was that maybe unwanted sexual arousal.

103
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,500
 *laughter*

104
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,500
 I read, I did read a wiki page about that called coughing fetish.

105
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,500
 Where, yeah, it's an actual thing.

106
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,500
 It's an actual thing.

107
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,500
 And we are a growing group of people who demand your respect.

108
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,500
 *laughter*

109
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:00,500
 No, it's so, but actually it's a bit misleading because coughing fetish is not sexy.

110
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,500
 *laughter*

111
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:08,500
 It leads to, it redirects to a page called smoking fetish and it's the fetish of watching people smoke.

112
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,500
 Well, speaking of getting turned on, you know when...

113
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,500
 I think you have a new member of your group then.

114
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,500
 If I can introduce myself.

115
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,500
 *laughter*

116
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,500
 I'm actually okay and I can promise I will never cough again in case it ends me by.

117
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:33,500
 But, you know when someone has a cold and like let's see you're going out with someone who has a cold.

118
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:38,500
 And they're like, well that's disgusting, you would have a cold, I'm not looking for any of my nails saying I'm going to kiss you.

119
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:44,500
 Actually, there is almost zero percent chance you're going to get infected from a cold by kissing someone.

120
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,500
 Right.

121
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:50,500
 Like the only way you can get infected is if nasal mucus dribbles down into your mouth during the...

122
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,500
 Well, exactly, you're not kissing that guy anyway.

123
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,500
 So, you can't, it's not an excuse.

124
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,500
 That's okay.

125
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,500
 It's not an excuse.

126
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,500
 But it's also a lot of reason for someone to kiss you just because you've got a cold.

127
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,500
 *laughter*

128
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,500
 Fish cough?

129
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:11,500
 *laughter*

130
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,500
 I've not got much on this.

131
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,500
 *laughter*

132
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,500
 That's the shortest fact ever is it's just two words.

133
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,500
 Yeah, nine letters.

134
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,500
 Yeah, they sort of, they have particles that clog out their gills and so it's a half cough, half sneeze.

135
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,500
 It's not exactly a cough.

136
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,500
 There's an internet factoid that giraffes don't cough.

137
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,500
 Oh yeah, I don't think that's true, isn't it?

138
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,500
 It isn't. I found a medical study of a giraffe that was coughing.

139
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,500
 *laughter*

140
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:41,500
 When the giraffe know it was about to cough before a human knew they were about to cough because it's got further to go.

141
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,500
 Yeah, when most people can cough within like 1.2 seconds.

142
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,500
 It's like three and a half minutes for a giraffe.

143
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:55,500
 But no, there was a giraffe with severe respiratory disease who couldn't stop coughing and ended up dying.

144
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,500
 Death visits us all later in the afternoon.

145
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,500
 So it would have died of something else.

146
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,500
 *laughter*

147
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,500
 James, I've lost them.

148
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,500
 Dolphins don't cough.

149
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,500
 Really?

150
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,500
 No.

151
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,500
 Do you have any more of that fact?

152
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,500
 *laughter*

153
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,500
 Back to you Andy.

154
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,500
 *laughter*

155
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,500
 My scoff.

156
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,500
 *laughter*

157
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,500
 Which is the same length as fish cough.

158
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,500
 So I've got to join short as fact.

159
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:41,500
 But scientists have tested it by spraying them with little mists of capsaicin or capsaicin,

160
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,500
 which is the molecule which makes chili pepper spicy.

161
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,500
 So they made a mist out of it and they sprayed a little bit of it at the mice.

162
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,500
 And then they had tiny microphones to listen.

163
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,500
 Yeah, because normally you can't hear mice coughing because it's such a small sound.

164
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,500
 So they need an extra sensitive microphone.

165
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,500
 But what have they built a mouse size version of this in my hand?

166
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,500
 The mice aren't holding the microphones.

167
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,500
 There's a tiny mouse podcast somewhere.

168
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,500
 Humans cough.

169
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,500
 *laughter*

170
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,500
 We're going to have to move on to our next slide.

171
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,500
 Oh, no more!

172
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:27,500
 So drinking cough syrup before a pie eating championship can shave 1.2 seconds of the time it takes you to eat a pie.

173
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,500
 *laughter*

174
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,500
 Why?

175
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,500
 It's kind of like nausea throat and lubricates as well, both of those things.

176
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,500
 And so there's a ban on what they called outside gravy.

177
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,500
 *laughter*

178
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,500
 In the world pie eating championships.

179
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,500
 Outside gravy, that's disgusting.

180
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:53,500
 But it was, the world pie eating championships is held in Wiggand and they thought that people were coming in with this gravy that was mixed with cough syrup.

181
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:59,500
 In 2009 Barry Rigby was the champion of the pie eating and this was the first year they brought in the new rule.

182
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,500
 And just, they asked him what is the trick of being a great pie eater.

183
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,500
 And he said, "I'm not giving too much away."

184
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,500
 But the basic rule is bite swallow, bite swallow.

185
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,500
 *laughter*

186
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,500
 Okay, time for fact number two and that is my fact.

187
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:23,500
 My fact this week is that the Colosseum has recently banned centurions.

188
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,500
 *laughter*

189
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,500
 Yeah, so basically obviously it's a massive tourist attraction now, the area.

190
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:33,500
 And like if you went somewhere like Hollywood, they'll have Spider-Man and Superman dressed up there.

191
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,500
 That's the same thing with the Colosseum.

192
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:40,500
 You get people dressed up as centurions and they're sort of hassling the tourists, they're charging too much, they're just getting in the way.

193
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,500
 Like a pest there now basically.

194
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,500
 That they've said you guys are banned and so it's the big holy year next year.

195
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,500
 And so they want to clean it up before the holy year happens.

196
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,500
 And so centurions are no longer allowed at the Colosseum.

197
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:58,500
 The quote from the mayor is amazing because he said that they were inappropriate, insistent and sometimes aggressive.

198
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,500
 Considering that dressed as men who conquered Europe.

199
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,500
 *laughter*

200
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:13,500
 Well centurions, I mean I think this is very well known but I just want to make it clear how many people they tended to rule over.

201
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,500
 It is quite weird, yeah, that they ruled over 80 people.

202
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,500
 There would be eight soldiers and then there would be ten blocks of eight and that would be a centuria.

203
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,500
 And centurions were all over them.

204
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,500
 But I like that two centurions, you know what they were called?

205
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,500
 I centurions.

206
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,500
 No, it was actually called a mannipple.

207
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,500
 *laughter*

208
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,500
 It's called a mannipple, it's a mannipple.

209
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,500
 But let's not mispronounce for comic effects.

210
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,500
 Mannipple.

211
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:47,500
 Yeah, mannipple, a mannipple is two centuries of Roman soldiers and it means literally a handful.

212
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,500
 It's from the same origin as manipulation which is a handful.

213
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,500
 So they keep for centurions getting into fights.

214
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:01,500
 And in 2013, this is just a story of the kind of scrapes they got into, one of them attacked a tourist.

215
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,500
 And the tourist fell over and broke a finger.

216
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:09,500
 And the tourist, it was called Jose Azna, said that he had offered the centurion more cash.

217
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,500
 Because that was the thing, they posed for a photo with you and then they say give us some money.

218
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,500
 They say give us five euros or ten euros, whatever.

219
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,500
 And he said he had offered the centurion more cash.

220
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,500
 But, quotes.

221
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:27,500
 He said in Italy we blow on nose with dollars and call me a son of a bitch, a mafioso and a cuckold.

222
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,500
 But it's a hard job being a living statue, isn't it?

223
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:37,500
 There was a guy, a red and an interview with a guy called Paul Edmides and he's a living statue.

224
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:43,500
 And he said that he's been spat on, prodded, pushed over, sniffed out by dogs,

225
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:51,500
 perched on by pigeons. But he said that occasionally a dog would urinate on him.

226
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,500
 He said he liked that because it was a sign that he was doing well.

227
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,500
 Wow.

228
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,500
 By matching going home after work and your wife goes, oh, how is your day?

229
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,500
 And your life is great. I got pissed on by six dogs.

230
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:11,500
 There was the first arrests related to living statues in the UK in 2011.

231
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:17,500
 And it happened when the invisible king was convicted of assaulting the silver wizard.

232
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:22,500
 And the king accused the wizard of stealing his spot, which was by the London Eye, prime turf.

233
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,500
 But the twist is they were flatmates.

234
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,500
 Imagine that flat when they're watching TV.

235
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:35,500
 Are they working? Are they not working?

236
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:42,500
 I was just looking at street performers on living statues. And there's a street performer in Paris.

237
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,500
 In 2013, a street performer in Paris called Stephen Cohen.

238
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:51,500
 And with his performance, he wanted to evoke his situation which was being torn between two countries.

239
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,500
 So his native country was South Africa and then it was France where he currently lived.

240
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,500
 And so what he did was he went to the Eiffel Tower and he was dressed like a bird.

241
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,500
 And he was wearing a garter and tights in these long red gloves.

242
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:09,500
 And no underwear or trousers. And had tied a rooster to his penis.

243
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,500
 And was being led around the Eiffel Tower by his penis by a rooster.

244
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:18,500
 And so that was his art and he was arrested in decent expression.

245
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,500
 Yeah, sure. I'm cool with that.

246
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:26,500
 He missed a chance to say it was being pulled around by his cock.

247
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,500
 I looked through an online database of street performers.

248
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:34,500
 Oh yeah. And I found, just I love these guys, they're called whispering trees.

249
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:39,500
 An absolute surefire shocker, brilliant either side of an entrance, watch the queue jump.

250
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,500
 So they just dress as trees, stand really still and then whisper it you as you go by.

251
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,500
 Oh wow. I also found Big Rory.

252
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,500
 Okay, and this is the exact entry on Big Rory in this database.

253
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:56,500
 Big Rory, the Scots giant with power presence and bagpipes, dangerous, but safe.

254
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,500
 It's funny it's a job where you have to be slightly shit to do well.

255
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,500
 It's true, there's no one paying statues money.

256
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:08,500
 Exactly, maybe Nelson on top of Nelson's car, there's a living statue.

257
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:13,500
 He's been there for 200 years, not under penny.

258
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:18,500
 And the world, they have a world statue championships in the Netherlands every year.

259
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,500
 And it was won by a Britain in 2009, which is really exciting.

260
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:27,500
 A guy called Chris Clarkson of South Pot. He does a lot of statue work.

261
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:32,500
 But before that, he was an actor and he'd worked in a touch of frost and in holly oches

262
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:37,500
 where presumably he was fired for having a bit too much of expression.

263
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:44,500
 They asked him how to be a good statue and he said to stand in front of the television for an hour and a half without moving.

264
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,500
 And then you'll get a feeling of what it's like.

265
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:51,500
 Because apparently it just really hurts, like standing still for long periods really, really hurts.

266
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,500
 Especially if you're watching the holly oches.

267
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:59,500
 An almost linking fact back to Roman legions and Roman soldiers.

268
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:05,500
 But also sort of on the street performances, did you know that Barth is haunted by a naked Roman soldier?

269
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,500
 No.

270
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,500
 Yeah, I didn't know this either.

271
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:15,500
 But apparently the apparition is said to be quite convincing.

272
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:20,500
 And at one point a police officer in Barthomers took it for a genuine striker and chased it down the street.

273
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,500
 Only to see it disappear into thin air.

274
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,500
 So look out for that. It's a naked Roman soldier.

275
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,500
 And the question this article asked, which I think you're going to ask me now.

276
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,500
 If he's naked, how do you know he's a Roman soldier?

277
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:38,500
 That is the question.

278
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:44,500
 Is he shouting, "Venny, VDV, cheers."

279
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,500
 Sometimes you just know.

280
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,500
 That's so good.

281
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,500
 I didn't read, I've been reading a book about haunted bits of Britain by Derek Acora.

282
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,500
 And that's not in there.

283
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,500
 There's amazing places.

284
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,500
 Can I tell you my favourite place in there?

285
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,500
 It's the Yovl railway station's buffet.

286
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:04,500
 It's haunted by a sausage roll.

287
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:09,500
 So just back to the Coliseum very quickly.

288
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,500
 They had what was probably, because obviously it was a huge arena.

289
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,500
 And they had seating. There was a seating plan as well.

290
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,500
 And they had probably the most early version.

291
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:24,500
 So far as I can read of ticketing, and the ticketing was done on pottery.

292
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,500
 So you were given shards of pottery, and they'd have chiseled into it,

293
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,500
 your seat, the row that you were in.

294
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,500
 How many people could they sit in there?

295
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,500
 That was about 50,000?

296
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,500
 Yeah, that's a lot of pottery.

297
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,500
 That's why you know when they find ancient Roman pottery,

298
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,500
 it's always in little bits and pieces.

299
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,500
 Because it was all broken up.

300
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,500
 It's the equivalent of one directions back in town.

301
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,500
 It's a smash of these.

302
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,500
 Okay, time for fact number three.

303
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,500
 And that is Chuzinski.

304
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:02,500
 Yeah, my fact this week is that, from 1978 to 1991,

305
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:07,500
 tens of thousands of chicken heads were dropped from helicopters over Switzerland.

306
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,500
 Okay, so yeah, okay, why? Tell us the story.

307
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,500
 So this was because there'd been a rabies epidemic in Europe from about the 1930s,

308
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,500
 I think, and foxes were infected with rabies, and it was spreading,

309
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,500
 and I think it spread about 20 miles a year.

310
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,500
 So it was gradually encroaching.

311
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,500
 And they didn't know how to get rid of it until they came up with this idea.

312
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:30,500
 In Switzerland, a Swiss scientist came up with this idea of putting vaccines,

313
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,500
 rabies vaccines into chicken heads that were left over from slaughterhouses,

314
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,500
 and then dropping them from helicopters over Switzerland,

315
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,500
 and then foxes eat the chicken heads, and they're immune from rabies.

316
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,500
 And I just think that's ingenious, and it works.

317
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,500
 So lots of European countries took this on.

318
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,500
 So I think Germany in the late 1980s said,

319
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,500
 "Okay, it's a bit weird and barbaric that you're doing this whole chicken head thing."

320
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,500
 So they manufactured just little fish pellets and dropped them instead with the vaccine in,

321
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,500
 and it turned out that worked as well.

322
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,500
 Yeah, it's not as cool though.

323
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:07,500
 Imagine being in a helicopter with a sack of chicken heads.

324
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,500
 You'd feel like the king of the world.

325
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:19,500
 But the worst thing is, oh, the king of the world is flying over us.

326
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,500
 I wonder what he's got to distribute.

327
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:26,500
 But they did, they, before they worked out the chicken head thing,

328
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,500
 they did try other options of how to vaccinate foxes.

329
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,500
 And one of the things, it was called the vac trap.

330
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,500
 And it was basically the equivalent of a bear trap.

331
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:40,500
 So anything that stood on it would trigger a giant needle that would just go "quang it into them"

332
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,500
 and inject them.

333
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:46,500
 And they had to stop because too many hikers kept walking along.

334
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,500
 It's suddenly getting walloped by a needle.

335
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,500
 But did you see that they actually didn't stop because of their hikers?

336
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,500
 Because they were concerned, the people who manufactured it, that that would be a problem.

337
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:00,500
 And you know, people are getting vaccinated against rabies they don't have when they're on a walk.

338
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:05,500
 And they set these traps on a, this is in the US, they did this.

339
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,500
 They set these traps on a beach, which was a deserted beach.

340
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,500
 And they thought this was a good place to test out our vaccine.

341
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:16,500
 And it turned out that the US Navy was planning to use that deserted beach a few days later

342
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,500
 to promote invasion as a training exercise for all of its soldiers.

343
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:24,500
 And so the people who'd set them offered to remove them.

344
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:29,500
 And officials argued that the hazards would serve as an additional measure of the invaders prowess.

345
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:34,500
 So the, the rabies vaccine was invented by Louis Pasteur.

346
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,500
 Yeah.

347
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,500
 A few other people as well, but he's like the headline guy, really.

348
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,500
 One of the things that he did in the lab is he would get some saliva from a rabid dog.

349
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,500
 And then he would use that for his experiments.

350
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:52,500
 But unlike everyone else who kind of used kind of gloves and I don't know how it sold classes.

351
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,500
 11 people use.

352
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,500
 He just went straight in there and just went up to the rabid dog.

353
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,500
 And just got the saliva out of there, right?

354
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:05,500
 Which is pretty brave considering that if you got bitten, the protocol was to be shot immediately.

355
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:09,500
 If you got bitten, you just got shot.

356
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,500
 That's fierce predical.

357
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,500
 That is hard car.

358
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:18,500
 I read that he sucked the saliva from the mouth of a rabid dog, which was sort of secured on a laptop.

359
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:23,500
 And he's supposedly using a pipette held in his mouth, which seems needlessly.

360
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,500
 It seems needlessly bravado-ish.

361
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:32,500
 It kind of feels like he's the bear grills of his day.

362
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,500
 It's amazing.

363
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,500
 On necessary feats of apparent courage.

364
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,500
 Well, I have a fact about air drops.

365
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,500
 Okay.

366
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,500
 And animal air drops.

367
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:48,500
 So wasps pick up ants when they're competing over food and drop them away from the food.

368
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,500
 This is true.

369
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:56,500
 Researchers observed this in the world and then they tested it on a real situation.

370
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,500
 So they put out some tuna.

371
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,500
 They let some ants go and start eating the tuna and then they release some wasps.

372
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,500
 And sometimes the ants will attack the wasp.

373
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,500
 And even though they're much smaller, they can spray former acid and stuff.

374
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:15,500
 And so sometimes the wasps just pick up the ants, fly them away from the tuna, drop them and then go back to the tuna.

375
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:19,500
 Imagine if you're flying around and just dropping ants anywhere you want to.

376
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:24,500
 You'd feel like King of the World.

377
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:31,500
 I regret sharing my fun to see with you.

378
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,500
 It's possible that the ants could enjoy that, are they right?

379
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:39,500
 It's like my meal was interrupted, but it was fun paragliding.

380
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:48,500
 That's actually small enough. There's a certain size of animal. Once you get small enough, you probably wouldn't die because your maximum velocity you can reach is not high enough to squish you.

381
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,500
 I think even mice, you can drop from really high height.

382
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,500
 They're not heavy enough to hurt them properly.

383
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,500
 Okay.

384
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:58,500
 Horses on the other hand.

385
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,500
 I have a chicken fact.

386
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:10,500
 Pond Square in Highgate in London is haunted by a half frozen chicken.

387
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:15,500
 Oh, I know who's chicken that is.

388
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:20,500
 So for a very long time, there's been a half frozen chicken that's been haunting this pond.

389
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,500
 And everyone has been sort of going, oh, there's a half frozen chicken.

390
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:38,500
 And it turns out that the half frozen chicken belonged to a man called Francis Bacon, who if you remember, died when he was experimenting on which bit don't you believe when you're shaking your head?

391
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:43,500
 First of all, he supposedly died of a chill after stuffing a chicken with snow, didn't he?

392
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,500
 I don't think that's true, first of all.

393
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,500
 And then the rest of it, obviously, I don't think that's true either.

394
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:57,500
 Why would the chicken horn highgate, though, that's what Francis Bacon might horn highgate, but the chicken was already dead, I think.

395
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,500
 I know it's a really odd situation.

396
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:04,500
 So chicken heads can help pro athletes, actually.

397
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,500
 And this is real. There's a guy called...

398
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,500
 Ouch. Wow.

399
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,500
 It's a terrible burn on everything we've heard so far.

400
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:22,500
 No, chicken heads can help pro athletes. There's a guy called Hans Wilhelm Mula Wolfart.

401
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:27,500
 He was the doctor from Bayern Munich until quite recently when he got fired.

402
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:34,500
 But he used to inject an extract of chicken heads into the kind of tendons of athletes to help them.

403
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,500
 There's a little bit of evidence that it might work.

404
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:44,500
 He treated Mike Lowen, Stephen Gerard, Usain Bolt, Paula Radcliffe, Bono.

405
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:49,500
 So five great athletes of our time.

406
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:53,500
 But he got fired quite recently, and he is quite controversial.

407
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:59,500
 He once prescribed goat's blood injections into a striker from a football team.

408
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:03,500
 But because he's called Hans, he's known as Healing Hans.

409
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,500
 But he is quite famous, actually.

410
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,500
 Do you guys know about cooking? No.

411
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:13,500
 Okay, I'm glad. Apparently this is a social media phenomenon where you cook.

412
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:19,500
 And it's kind of like planking, but instead of lying flat and impersonating your plank in front of the camera,

413
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,500
 you pretend to be a frozen chicken carcass in public.

414
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,500
 Do you have to pour on the high gate?

415
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,500
 You can actually do it anyway.

416
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:34,500
 So all you have to do is take all of your clothes off and then crouch down and then have a photo taken of yourself

417
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,500
 and then a naked person crouch down in a fetal position sort of on their knees.

418
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,500
 Looks like a chicken, a chicken carcass.

419
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:47,500
 How does someone sat the naked look like a chicken any more than a centurion?

420
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,500
 Good point.

421
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:54,500
 No, so okay, so if you were just very quickly, if you were going sort of profile

422
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,500
 and you were leaning on your knees and you were leaning over,

423
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:01,500
 a human in that position looks remarkably like a frozen chicken.

424
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:05,500
 So many mistakes on Christmas Day.

425
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:11,500
 Can I, this fact has the element of talking about these were dropped from helicopters.

426
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,500
 I started looking into helicopters slightly.

427
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:20,500
 Do you know that the world's biggest helicopter can carry it big enough that it can carry a plane?

428
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,500
 Wow, it's nice.

429
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,500
 No way.

430
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,500
 Do you know when the earliest helicopter was?

431
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,500
 No.

432
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,500
 Da Vinci supposedly had one, did he?

433
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,500
 He drew one.

434
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,500
 He designed one, yes.

435
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:35,500
 But it wasn't as early as the helicopter that was invented in 400 BC by the Chinese.

436
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,500
 What?

437
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:40,500
 Which, because officially, so this was, it was called the Bamboo Copter, apparently,

438
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,500
 which stresses me out.

439
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,500
 I think I might have mentioned on the podcast before that one of my favourite etymologies is helicopter,

440
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:50,500
 because it's the etymology is so unusually split up.

441
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,500
 So it's helicos, which is a spiral and a poteir,

442
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:57,500
 which you wouldn't expect to be a word on its own, which is like the wing.

443
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:01,500
 So by saying Bamboo Copter, they've stomped right in the middle of that word helicos.

444
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,500
 You should never say anything copter.

445
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,500
 It should be either pter or helicos.

446
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,500
 Exactly.

447
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,500
 Yeah, I feel your pain, Anna.

448
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:14,500
 Yeah, I've written a strongly worded letter to ancient Chinese emperors.

449
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:18,500
 You know a very popular escape from prisoners via helicopter.

450
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,500
 I mean, popular.

451
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,500
 To find popular.

452
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:26,500
 It seems to be, so people actually do it more often than you would think.

453
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:31,500
 France holds the record for most prison escapes via helicopter.

454
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:36,500
 And that's 11, so actually not as much as I was, as I was saying earlier.

455
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,500
 Oh, sorry.

456
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,500
 It's epidemic proportions.

457
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:43,500
 But there's a guy with the world record for most helicopter escapes from prison,

458
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,500
 which is three.

459
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,500
 He escaped in 2001, 2003, 2007.

460
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:51,500
 And at no point did someone go, we should watch out for this guy every time he goes into the yard.

461
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,500
 I say let's put a roof on Davies, so I say we should.

462
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,500
 OK, time for our final fact.

463
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,500
 And that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

464
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:07,500
 My fact is that in 2015, a 10-year study concluded that punching glass is very dangerous.

465
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:11,500
 Wasn't the only thing they found out, but it was pretty much the headline.

466
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:16,500
 There was a study by a group of Australian doctors, and they concluded in about July this year.

467
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:22,500
 They measured everyone who came into a particular hospital from 2003 to 2012, collected lots of data.

468
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:27,500
 And they said that it is really, really dangerous to punch glass.

469
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,500
 And they found out other things.

470
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:34,500
 They found out that the typical patient who punches glass is a 26-year-old single male

471
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,500
 who is unemployed and intoxicated.

472
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:49,500
 Of the 137 people that they found who punched glass, 113 women, 122 were single.

473
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:54,500
 95 were unemployed and 91 were drunk.

474
00:28:54,500 --> 00:29:00,500
 Wow, and they have one conclusion as well, which is how to deal with this thing.

475
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:06,500
 Preventing young, intoxicated males from aiming punches at glass is a difficult task.

476
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:16,500
 And perhaps the only rational method, although costly, is to replace all glass within arms reach with safety glass.

477
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:21,500
 Now more glass for you.

478
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,500
 That's amazing.

479
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:27,500
 I think it might be cheaper to replace all drunk men with so many.

480
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:31,500
 This was in Australia, but there was another study in Sunderland.

481
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:36,500
 And there were only 67 patients in this one, but it was in Sunderland.

482
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:41,500
 And so England's Australia.

483
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:48,500
 Well, they found that all of the people had consumed alcohol.

484
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,500
 So it's dangerous. Why is it dangerous?

485
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,500
 Well, Anna.

486
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,500
 Because you can mess your hand up real bad.

487
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,500
 Like the glass breaks and then a glass gets into your stomach.

488
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,500
 I was wondering if there were any more complex conclusions in that your hand.

489
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,500
 So it was just that people got injured a lot.

490
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:11,500
 People say that 'cause I put my hand through a window once, but I wasn't even drunk.

491
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,500
 You were drunk on 26 a male every time.

492
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,500
 I actually wasn't any of those things.

493
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,500
 But I remembered the fact that I was about a 15.

494
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:24,500
 I remember that people had said that the time people must get injured is when they retract their arm, when they've broken glass,

495
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,500
 because that's when it slices up against you.

496
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:35,500
 And so I held my hand suspended out with a window and I was in my family and I was like, "Daddy, what do I do now?"

497
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:40,500
 But I didn't even lose two. Well, I held my arm through the hole in the glass until my dad came upstairs

498
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,500
 and went, "You can't pull your hand out of the glass now."

499
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,500
 And it was absolutely fine.

500
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,500
 And you would have that presence of mine to think,

501
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,500
 "I remember reading a paper about this guy."

502
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:58,500
 And thus was a QI researcher born.

503
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:04,500
 I was researching great bits of glass just to see...

504
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,500
 Just to see what was considered to be...

505
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:11,500
 And thus was a great QI researcher not born.

506
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,500
 Yeah, so I was looking into great bits of glass.

507
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:18,500
 And then I came across a whole sort of, "Did you mean great bits of glass to stand on?"

508
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,500
 And so I started reading into great bits of glass to stand on.

509
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,500
 Now, one of the best bits of glass to stand on.

510
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:29,500
 And it's not a typo glass, but it's an achievement if you ever get to stand on this.

511
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:35,500
 There's actually, at the bottom of the International Space Station, so I know in a gravityless place,

512
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,500
 there can't really be a bottom, but it's the bit that's facing Earth.

513
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,500
 They actually have a glass floor that you can stand on.

514
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:46,500
 So, yeah, so you push yourself up to it and there's photos of astronauts looking down,

515
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,500
 so they can see all of Earth below their feet.

516
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:52,500
 Which is really nice. I've not heard that before as an International Space Station.

517
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,500
 And it reminded me that in the Grand Canyon,

518
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:59,500
 you can actually go on a thing called the Skywalk now, which is really amazing.

519
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,500
 So it's this incredible bit that hangs over the Grand Canyon.

520
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,500
 It's complete glass and you just look down as you're looking over.

521
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,500
 When they opened it, they wanted some spectacular people to walk on it.

522
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:13,500
 And they asked Buzz Aldrin, "Would you be one of the two first people to do it?"

523
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:18,500
 And there was another astronaut there, a guy who's the only Native American astronaut,

524
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,500
 a part Native American astronaut.

525
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,500
 Oh, don't tell me the buzz was the second person.

526
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:26,500
 They were meant to meet up at the middle and Buzz stopped to do a salute at the guy got there first.

527
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:31,500
 So he's the second, once again, the second man to make it to something.

528
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,500
 Oh, no.

529
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,500
 On punching.

530
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,500
 Yeah, yeah.

531
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:41,500
 So, recent research has just been done into the human fist.

532
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:46,500
 And there is a suggestion and one scientist strongly believes on the basis of this research

533
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,500
 that the human fist was evolved for punching.

534
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:53,500
 So we think that humans are superior to all other beings,

535
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:57,500
 because we evolved with our dexterous hands for writing or for whatever.

536
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,500
 We actually evolved to beat each other up.

537
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,500
 And it turns out we're much more well adapted.

538
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:05,500
 Our fist, the fact that they fit our fingers fit so well into the palm of our hands,

539
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,500
 that really is ideal for punch-ups.

540
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:11,500
 So the idea is that an opposable thumb you could use to grab something,

541
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:16,500
 but you can also use it to kind of buttress your fist to properly hit someone, right?

542
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:20,500
 Hold it down. And nature's being defensive as well as aggressive,

543
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:24,500
 because apparently males have evolved to be punched.

544
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,500
 Before you go any further, I have not.

545
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:31,500
 Your face says otherwise.

546
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:47,500
 So, what was on the head with some applause over there?

547
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:53,500
 Do you know that the World Record most punches, quickest punches, this is ridiculous, by the way.

548
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:57,500
 But the most punches in 15 seconds is 200.

549
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,500
 No way!

550
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:03,500
 I think he was hitting like... 200 guys.

551
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:09,500
 Yeah, he was hitting a punch bag, I think.

552
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:13,500
 Do you know there's a robot that they've trained to punch humans?

553
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,500
 Why would you do that?

554
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:19,500
 We've all seen Terminator 2, we know that it's...

555
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:25,500
 This is a Frownhofer-IFF Institute in Germany,

556
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,500
 and they've invented a robot that punches people.

557
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:33,500
 And the idea is that you contest how hard it has to hit a human before it hurts.

558
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:39,500
 Wow, these guys are idiots, and they're going to be the first against the wall when the robot turns.

559
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:45,500
 They have like an ultrasound scanner that can tell whether you're bruising or not before you actually bruise.

560
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:52,500
 And the idea, according to them, is that it's going to stop in the future from humans being injured by robots.

561
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:56,500
 So we're prepping for Frownhofer, that's amazing.

562
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:00,500
 You know that you also, when you donate your body to science,

563
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:06,500
 and you can read up now on how many different ways they sort of take you apart and use different bits for different things,

564
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:12,500
 one of the things is that they'll take your arm now and just have it punching a punching bag constantly to see why we punch.

565
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,500
 Wow, that's amazing.

566
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:18,500
 There's another one where you can become like a crash test dummy, can't you?

567
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:24,500
 Because a normal crash test dummy is quite hard to get a real, you can't make it really like a human,

568
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:30,500
 but if you put a human in there and then see how they react to being in a crash, then that really, really does help science.

569
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,500
 It's an amazing tool.

570
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:38,500
 It's like, if you've done anything bad ass in your actual life, I think saying, writing on your donor card at the bottom,

571
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:42,500
 please preference for crash test dummy, it is the way to go.

572
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:46,500
 I would like my head to be thrown out of a helicopter.

573
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:52,500
 Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening.

574
00:35:52,500 --> 00:36:02,500
 If you would like to get in contact with any of us about the things we've said over the course of this past cast,

575
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:06,500
 we could be found on our Twitter account, so I'm on @Sriberland, James.

576

579
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:22,500
 Thank you so much for listening. Thank you so much for being here, guys.

580
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,500
 Goodbye.

581
