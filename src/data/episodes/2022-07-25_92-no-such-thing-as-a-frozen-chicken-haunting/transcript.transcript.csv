00:00:08,00:00:11,"That didn't work at all, let's have the theme change."
00:00:11,00:00:14,*music*
00:00:14,00:00:17,*music*
00:00:17,00:00:20,*cheering*
00:00:20,00:00:23,How are you?
00:00:23,00:00:29,"And welcome to another episode of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"" a weekly podcast this week coming to you."
00:00:29,00:00:32,"From the ""Up the Creek"" comedy club in Greenwich."
00:00:32,00:00:34,My name is Dan Schreiber and please welcome to the stage.
00:00:34,00:00:38,It's the three regulars Anichesinsky James Harkin and Andy Murray!
00:00:38,00:00:48,*cheering*
00:00:48,00:00:53,And once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:00:53,00:00:56,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:56,00:00:58,"Starting with you, James Harkin."
00:00:58,00:01:07,"Okay, my fact this week is that there is only a one in 800,000 chance that nobody will cough during this podcast recording."
00:01:07,00:01:11,*laughter*
00:01:11,00:01:15,How those odds are looking bad.
00:01:15,00:01:20,"Yeah, so there's a recent study done that I saw this on the improbable website."
00:01:20,00:01:31,"And it was by Professor Andreas Wagner from the University of Hanover and it was called ""Why do people not cough in concerts, the economics of concerts etiquette?"""
00:01:31,00:01:43,And he basically found out the probability that a certain number of people would cough and I kind of extrapolated his data into the number of people who are here tonight and got it completely wrong.
00:01:43,00:01:45,*laughter*
00:01:45,00:01:47,"I did huge genuine coughs, that was one."
00:01:47,00:01:50,"No, we put the idea in their minds now."
00:01:50,00:01:52,"Yeah, I have an unbearable urge to cough."
00:01:52,00:01:53,*laughter*
00:01:53,00:01:54,"I'm not very suggestible, but..."
00:01:54,00:01:57,This could really have spiled the entire podcast.
00:01:57,00:02:06,So I read a different report that suggested that people actively try to cough more when they go to classical concerts.
00:02:06,00:02:07,"Yeah, what?"
00:02:07,00:02:10,"Yeah, they find themselves just wanting to..."
00:02:10,00:02:14,"Well, I knew it. There's so annoying. Why are they doing that all the time?"
00:02:14,00:02:16,I don't know. I mean...
00:02:16,00:02:18,"Hang on, you haven't looked into what their motivation is."
00:02:18,00:02:22,I was kind of hoping one of you guys had it. It was at the top of the Google search. I figured you guys agreed it.
00:02:22,00:02:25,"Well, luckily enough, I did look into that."
00:02:25,00:02:26,"Oh, yeah!"
00:02:26,00:02:27,*laughter*
00:02:27,00:02:33,There's a few different thoughts. One is that you might be showing displeasure to the performance.
00:02:33,00:02:36,"And you'll think it's a bit like, ""I'm not happy, I'm just going to cough in it."""
00:02:36,00:02:38,"Yeah, a great bar show."
00:02:38,00:02:40,*laughter*
00:02:40,00:02:48,"Oh my god. Yeah, and the other thing is maybe you are actively suppressing the idea that you're going to cough through most of it."
00:02:48,00:02:52,"And then suddenly you think, ""Okay, this allowed bit, I can finally cough."" And you would do it that way."
00:02:52,00:02:55,"Okay, people always do in the loud parts."
00:02:55,00:02:56,Yeah.
00:02:56,00:02:57,"Yeah, yeah."
00:02:57,00:02:58,*laughter*
00:02:58,00:03:05,"There's a guy called Robert R. Provein, who writes amazing studies on sneezing and yawning and on coughing."
00:03:05,00:03:12,And he does all these studies on bits of human experience that don't get much scientific attention because they're not seen as important.
00:03:12,00:03:17,And so he has studied lots and lots of people about coughing and he didn't experiment.
00:03:17,00:03:19,He asked people to cough.
00:03:19,00:03:23,"So, on average, you can cough within 1.7 seconds if you're asked to."
00:03:23,00:03:24,*laughter*
00:03:24,00:03:28,"Whereas if you're asked to sneeze on demand, most people can't do it."
00:03:28,00:03:31,"And if they can, the average time is 8.1 seconds to sum it up."
00:03:31,00:03:37,"Which I think is amazing that anyone can do that. In 8 seconds, it would take me ages to work up a sneeze."
00:03:37,00:03:38,Yeah.
00:03:38,00:03:39,Yeah.
00:03:39,00:03:42,I used to have a friend that could vomit on command.
00:03:42,00:03:45,"It's true, it's true. Some people have this."
00:03:45,00:03:50,"And he would only need a tiny sip of something and then he'd go, ""What?"" and just yak up onto the street."
00:03:50,00:03:51,It was amazing.
00:03:51,00:03:52,It was extraordinary.
00:03:52,00:03:53,What does he do these days?
00:03:53,00:03:55,His Australia's got talent.
00:03:55,00:03:57,*laughter*
00:03:57,00:04:04,"Do you know that? So, talking of sneezing and coughing, a cough leaves your mouth at 50 miles an hour."
00:04:04,00:04:05,Which is quite fast.
00:04:05,00:04:08,"And I think it's, yeah, 3,000 droplets are expelled when you cough."
00:04:08,00:04:11,"So, one cough, 3,000 droplets are expelled."
00:04:11,00:04:19,"When you sneeze, it leaves your mouth at more than 200 miles an hour and more than 40,000 droplets are expelled from your mouth in one sneeze."
00:04:19,00:04:20,Wow.
00:04:20,00:04:21,How cool is that?
00:04:21,00:04:22,How many miles in it?
00:04:22,00:04:26,"Two, more than 200 miles an hour for a sneeze, 50 for a cough, so it's way ahead."
00:04:26,00:04:29,If you sneeze in a car that is going at 80 miles an hour...
00:04:29,00:04:31,*laughter*
00:04:31,00:04:35,I suppose technically that sneeze is going at 280 miles an hour.
00:04:35,00:04:38,I feel like I need to explain relativity to you.
00:04:38,00:04:40,"No, I mean..."
00:04:40,00:04:43,"No, it's not the time."
00:04:43,00:04:48,"So, people who are extremely bothered by coughing might have a thing called mesophonia."
00:04:48,00:04:53,"Which is, basically, it's a kind of thing where you're really bothered by any kind of noise."
00:04:53,00:04:54,But coughing is one of them.
00:04:54,00:04:56,Chewing food is another one.
00:04:56,00:04:57,And...
00:04:57,00:04:58,*laughter*
00:04:58,00:05:00,We've got a few mesophones in tonight.
00:05:00,00:05:02,*laughter*
00:05:02,00:05:03,Mesophones.
00:05:03,00:05:05,I think it's someone that sounds like a cough.
00:05:05,00:05:08,*laughter*
00:05:08,00:05:14,There's a 10-level scale of mesophonia and you can go online and see which one you are.
00:05:14,00:05:20,Level 5 is when you cover your ears if someone's coughing or kind of chewing or whatever.
00:05:20,00:05:25,Level 9 is consciously suppressing the desire to do harm to others.
00:05:25,00:05:28,*laughter*
00:05:28,00:05:30,And level 10 is actual violence.
00:05:30,00:05:32,*laughter*
00:05:32,00:05:33,Wow.
00:05:33,00:05:35,"Level 7, I found really interesting."
00:05:35,00:05:37,"It said in level 7, there was a few different things."
00:05:37,00:05:41,And one of them was that maybe unwanted sexual arousal.
00:05:41,00:05:42,*laughter*
00:05:42,00:05:46,"I read, I did read a wiki page about that called coughing fetish."
00:05:46,00:05:48,"Where, yeah, it's an actual thing."
00:05:48,00:05:49,It's an actual thing.
00:05:49,00:05:53,And we are a growing group of people who demand your respect.
00:05:53,00:05:55,*laughter*
00:05:55,00:06:00,"No, it's so, but actually it's a bit misleading because coughing fetish is not sexy."
00:06:00,00:06:01,*laughter*
00:06:01,00:06:08,"It leads to, it redirects to a page called smoking fetish and it's the fetish of watching people smoke."
00:06:08,00:06:12,"Well, speaking of getting turned on, you know when..."
00:06:12,00:06:16,I think you have a new member of your group then.
00:06:16,00:06:20,If I can introduce myself.
00:06:20,00:06:24,*laughter*
00:06:24,00:06:28,I'm actually okay and I can promise I will never cough again in case it ends me by.
00:06:28,00:06:33,"But, you know when someone has a cold and like let's see you're going out with someone who has a cold."
00:06:33,00:06:38,"And they're like, well that's disgusting, you would have a cold, I'm not looking for any of my nails saying I'm going to kiss you."
00:06:38,00:06:44,"Actually, there is almost zero percent chance you're going to get infected from a cold by kissing someone."
00:06:44,00:06:45,Right.
00:06:45,00:06:50,Like the only way you can get infected is if nasal mucus dribbles down into your mouth during the...
00:06:50,00:06:52,"Well, exactly, you're not kissing that guy anyway."
00:06:52,00:06:55,"So, you can't, it's not an excuse."
00:06:55,00:06:56,That's okay.
00:06:56,00:06:58,It's not an excuse.
00:06:58,00:07:01,But it's also a lot of reason for someone to kiss you just because you've got a cold.
00:07:01,00:07:04,*laughter*
00:07:04,00:07:06,Fish cough?
00:07:06,00:07:11,*laughter*
00:07:11,00:07:13,I've not got much on this.
00:07:13,00:07:15,*laughter*
00:07:15,00:07:17,That's the shortest fact ever is it's just two words.
00:07:17,00:07:19,"Yeah, nine letters."
00:07:19,00:07:23,"Yeah, they sort of, they have particles that clog out their gills and so it's a half cough, half sneeze."
00:07:23,00:07:25,It's not exactly a cough.
00:07:25,00:07:28,There's an internet factoid that giraffes don't cough.
00:07:28,00:07:30,"Oh yeah, I don't think that's true, isn't it?"
00:07:30,00:07:34,It isn't. I found a medical study of a giraffe that was coughing.
00:07:34,00:07:36,*laughter*
00:07:36,00:07:41,When the giraffe know it was about to cough before a human knew they were about to cough because it's got further to go.
00:07:41,00:07:45,"Yeah, when most people can cough within like 1.2 seconds."
00:07:45,00:07:48,It's like three and a half minutes for a giraffe.
00:07:48,00:07:55,"But no, there was a giraffe with severe respiratory disease who couldn't stop coughing and ended up dying."
00:07:55,00:07:59,Death visits us all later in the afternoon.
00:07:59,00:08:03,So it would have died of something else.
00:08:03,00:08:07,*laughter*
00:08:07,00:08:11,"James, I've lost them."
00:08:11,00:08:15,Dolphins don't cough.
00:08:15,00:08:16,Really?
00:08:16,00:08:17,No.
00:08:17,00:08:19,Do you have any more of that fact?
00:08:19,00:08:21,*laughter*
00:08:21,00:08:23,Back to you Andy.
00:08:23,00:08:25,*laughter*
00:08:25,00:08:27,My scoff.
00:08:27,00:08:29,*laughter*
00:08:29,00:08:32,Which is the same length as fish cough.
00:08:32,00:08:35,So I've got to join short as fact.
00:08:35,00:08:41,"But scientists have tested it by spraying them with little mists of capsaicin or capsaicin,"
00:08:41,00:08:44,which is the molecule which makes chili pepper spicy.
00:08:44,00:08:48,So they made a mist out of it and they sprayed a little bit of it at the mice.
00:08:48,00:08:51,And then they had tiny microphones to listen.
00:08:51,00:08:55,"Yeah, because normally you can't hear mice coughing because it's such a small sound."
00:08:55,00:08:57,So they need an extra sensitive microphone.
00:08:57,00:09:01,But what have they built a mouse size version of this in my hand?
00:09:01,00:09:03,The mice aren't holding the microphones.
00:09:03,00:09:07,There's a tiny mouse podcast somewhere.
00:09:07,00:09:09,Humans cough.
00:09:09,00:09:13,*laughter*
00:09:13,00:09:15,We're going to have to move on to our next slide.
00:09:15,00:09:17,"Oh, no more!"
00:09:17,00:09:27,So drinking cough syrup before a pie eating championship can shave 1.2 seconds of the time it takes you to eat a pie.
00:09:27,00:09:29,*laughter*
00:09:29,00:09:31,Why?
00:09:31,00:09:35,"It's kind of like nausea throat and lubricates as well, both of those things."
00:09:35,00:09:39,And so there's a ban on what they called outside gravy.
00:09:39,00:09:41,*laughter*
00:09:41,00:09:43,In the world pie eating championships.
00:09:43,00:09:45,"Outside gravy, that's disgusting."
00:09:45,00:09:53,"But it was, the world pie eating championships is held in Wiggand and they thought that people were coming in with this gravy that was mixed with cough syrup."
00:09:53,00:09:59,In 2009 Barry Rigby was the champion of the pie eating and this was the first year they brought in the new rule.
00:09:59,00:10:03,"And just, they asked him what is the trick of being a great pie eater."
00:10:03,00:10:05,"And he said, ""I'm not giving too much away."""
00:10:05,00:10:09,"But the basic rule is bite swallow, bite swallow."
00:10:09,00:10:13,*laughter*
00:10:13,00:10:17,"Okay, time for fact number two and that is my fact."
00:10:17,00:10:23,My fact this week is that the Colosseum has recently banned centurions.
00:10:23,00:10:25,*laughter*
00:10:25,00:10:28,"Yeah, so basically obviously it's a massive tourist attraction now, the area."
00:10:28,00:10:33,"And like if you went somewhere like Hollywood, they'll have Spider-Man and Superman dressed up there."
00:10:33,00:10:35,That's the same thing with the Colosseum.
00:10:35,00:10:40,"You get people dressed up as centurions and they're sort of hassling the tourists, they're charging too much, they're just getting in the way."
00:10:40,00:10:42,Like a pest there now basically.
00:10:42,00:10:46,That they've said you guys are banned and so it's the big holy year next year.
00:10:46,00:10:49,And so they want to clean it up before the holy year happens.
00:10:49,00:10:52,And so centurions are no longer allowed at the Colosseum.
00:10:52,00:10:58,"The quote from the mayor is amazing because he said that they were inappropriate, insistent and sometimes aggressive."
00:10:58,00:11:02,Considering that dressed as men who conquered Europe.
00:11:02,00:11:05,*laughter*
00:11:05,00:11:13,"Well centurions, I mean I think this is very well known but I just want to make it clear how many people they tended to rule over."
00:11:13,00:11:17,"It is quite weird, yeah, that they ruled over 80 people."
00:11:17,00:11:21,There would be eight soldiers and then there would be ten blocks of eight and that would be a centuria.
00:11:21,00:11:23,And centurions were all over them.
00:11:23,00:11:25,"But I like that two centurions, you know what they were called?"
00:11:25,00:11:27,I centurions.
00:11:27,00:11:29,"No, it was actually called a mannipple."
00:11:29,00:11:31,*laughter*
00:11:31,00:11:35,"It's called a mannipple, it's a mannipple."
00:11:35,00:11:39,But let's not mispronounce for comic effects.
00:11:39,00:11:41,Mannipple.
00:11:41,00:11:47,"Yeah, mannipple, a mannipple is two centuries of Roman soldiers and it means literally a handful."
00:11:47,00:11:51,It's from the same origin as manipulation which is a handful.
00:11:51,00:11:55,So they keep for centurions getting into fights.
00:11:55,00:12:01,"And in 2013, this is just a story of the kind of scrapes they got into, one of them attacked a tourist."
00:12:01,00:12:03,And the tourist fell over and broke a finger.
00:12:03,00:12:09,"And the tourist, it was called Jose Azna, said that he had offered the centurion more cash."
00:12:09,00:12:13,"Because that was the thing, they posed for a photo with you and then they say give us some money."
00:12:13,00:12:15,"They say give us five euros or ten euros, whatever."
00:12:15,00:12:17,And he said he had offered the centurion more cash.
00:12:17,00:12:19,"But, quotes."
00:12:19,00:12:27,"He said in Italy we blow on nose with dollars and call me a son of a bitch, a mafioso and a cuckold."
00:12:27,00:12:31,"But it's a hard job being a living statue, isn't it?"
00:12:31,00:12:37,"There was a guy, a red and an interview with a guy called Paul Edmides and he's a living statue."
00:12:37,00:12:43,"And he said that he's been spat on, prodded, pushed over, sniffed out by dogs,"
00:12:43,00:12:51,perched on by pigeons. But he said that occasionally a dog would urinate on him.
00:12:51,00:12:55,He said he liked that because it was a sign that he was doing well.
00:12:55,00:12:57,Wow.
00:12:57,00:13:01,"By matching going home after work and your wife goes, oh, how is your day?"
00:13:01,00:13:05,And your life is great. I got pissed on by six dogs.
00:13:05,00:13:11,There was the first arrests related to living statues in the UK in 2011.
00:13:11,00:13:17,And it happened when the invisible king was convicted of assaulting the silver wizard.
00:13:17,00:13:22,"And the king accused the wizard of stealing his spot, which was by the London Eye, prime turf."
00:13:22,00:13:26,But the twist is they were flatmates.
00:13:26,00:13:30,Imagine that flat when they're watching TV.
00:13:30,00:13:35,Are they working? Are they not working?
00:13:35,00:13:42,I was just looking at street performers on living statues. And there's a street performer in Paris.
00:13:42,00:13:45,"In 2013, a street performer in Paris called Stephen Cohen."
00:13:45,00:13:51,"And with his performance, he wanted to evoke his situation which was being torn between two countries."
00:13:51,00:13:55,So his native country was South Africa and then it was France where he currently lived.
00:13:55,00:13:59,And so what he did was he went to the Eiffel Tower and he was dressed like a bird.
00:13:59,00:14:03,And he was wearing a garter and tights in these long red gloves.
00:14:03,00:14:09,And no underwear or trousers. And had tied a rooster to his penis.
00:14:09,00:14:13,And was being led around the Eiffel Tower by his penis by a rooster.
00:14:13,00:14:18,And so that was his art and he was arrested in decent expression.
00:14:18,00:14:21,"Yeah, sure. I'm cool with that."
00:14:21,00:14:26,He missed a chance to say it was being pulled around by his cock.
00:14:26,00:14:29,I looked through an online database of street performers.
00:14:29,00:14:34,"Oh yeah. And I found, just I love these guys, they're called whispering trees."
00:14:34,00:14:39,"An absolute surefire shocker, brilliant either side of an entrance, watch the queue jump."
00:14:39,00:14:43,"So they just dress as trees, stand really still and then whisper it you as you go by."
00:14:43,00:14:47,Oh wow. I also found Big Rory.
00:14:47,00:14:50,"Okay, and this is the exact entry on Big Rory in this database."
00:14:50,00:14:56,"Big Rory, the Scots giant with power presence and bagpipes, dangerous, but safe."
00:14:56,00:15:00,It's funny it's a job where you have to be slightly shit to do well.
00:15:00,00:15:03,"It's true, there's no one paying statues money."
00:15:03,00:15:08,"Exactly, maybe Nelson on top of Nelson's car, there's a living statue."
00:15:08,00:15:13,"He's been there for 200 years, not under penny."
00:15:13,00:15:18,"And the world, they have a world statue championships in the Netherlands every year."
00:15:18,00:15:22,"And it was won by a Britain in 2009, which is really exciting."
00:15:22,00:15:27,A guy called Chris Clarkson of South Pot. He does a lot of statue work.
00:15:27,00:15:32,"But before that, he was an actor and he'd worked in a touch of frost and in holly oches"
00:15:32,00:15:37,where presumably he was fired for having a bit too much of expression.
00:15:37,00:15:44,They asked him how to be a good statue and he said to stand in front of the television for an hour and a half without moving.
00:15:44,00:15:46,And then you'll get a feeling of what it's like.
00:15:46,00:15:51,"Because apparently it just really hurts, like standing still for long periods really, really hurts."
00:15:51,00:15:54,Especially if you're watching the holly oches.
00:15:54,00:15:59,An almost linking fact back to Roman legions and Roman soldiers.
00:15:59,00:16:05,"But also sort of on the street performances, did you know that Barth is haunted by a naked Roman soldier?"
00:16:05,00:16:06,No.
00:16:06,00:16:09,"Yeah, I didn't know this either."
00:16:09,00:16:15,But apparently the apparition is said to be quite convincing.
00:16:15,00:16:20,And at one point a police officer in Barthomers took it for a genuine striker and chased it down the street.
00:16:20,00:16:23,Only to see it disappear into thin air.
00:16:23,00:16:25,So look out for that. It's a naked Roman soldier.
00:16:25,00:16:29,"And the question this article asked, which I think you're going to ask me now."
00:16:29,00:16:33,"If he's naked, how do you know he's a Roman soldier?"
00:16:33,00:16:38,That is the question.
00:16:38,00:16:44,"Is he shouting, ""Venny, VDV, cheers."""
00:16:44,00:16:46,Sometimes you just know.
00:16:46,00:16:47,That's so good.
00:16:47,00:16:51,"I didn't read, I've been reading a book about haunted bits of Britain by Derek Acora."
00:16:51,00:16:53,And that's not in there.
00:16:53,00:16:54,There's amazing places.
00:16:54,00:16:56,Can I tell you my favourite place in there?
00:16:56,00:17:00,It's the Yovl railway station's buffet.
00:17:00,00:17:04,It's haunted by a sausage roll.
00:17:04,00:17:09,So just back to the Coliseum very quickly.
00:17:09,00:17:13,"They had what was probably, because obviously it was a huge arena."
00:17:13,00:17:16,And they had seating. There was a seating plan as well.
00:17:16,00:17:19,And they had probably the most early version.
00:17:19,00:17:24,"So far as I can read of ticketing, and the ticketing was done on pottery."
00:17:24,00:17:28,"So you were given shards of pottery, and they'd have chiseled into it,"
00:17:28,00:17:31,"your seat, the row that you were in."
00:17:31,00:17:33,How many people could they sit in there?
00:17:33,00:17:35,"That was about 50,000?"
00:17:35,00:17:37,"Yeah, that's a lot of pottery."
00:17:37,00:17:41,"That's why you know when they find ancient Roman pottery,"
00:17:41,00:17:44,it's always in little bits and pieces.
00:17:44,00:17:46,Because it was all broken up.
00:17:46,00:17:49,It's the equivalent of one directions back in town.
00:17:49,00:17:51,It's a smash of these.
00:17:51,00:17:54,"Okay, time for fact number three."
00:17:54,00:17:57,And that is Chuzinski.
00:17:57,00:18:02,"Yeah, my fact this week is that, from 1978 to 1991,"
00:18:02,00:18:07,tens of thousands of chicken heads were dropped from helicopters over Switzerland.
00:18:07,00:18:11,"Okay, so yeah, okay, why? Tell us the story."
00:18:11,00:18:15,"So this was because there'd been a rabies epidemic in Europe from about the 1930s,"
00:18:15,00:18:18,"I think, and foxes were infected with rabies, and it was spreading,"
00:18:18,00:18:20,and I think it spread about 20 miles a year.
00:18:20,00:18:22,So it was gradually encroaching.
00:18:22,00:18:25,And they didn't know how to get rid of it until they came up with this idea.
00:18:25,00:18:30,"In Switzerland, a Swiss scientist came up with this idea of putting vaccines,"
00:18:30,00:18:34,"rabies vaccines into chicken heads that were left over from slaughterhouses,"
00:18:34,00:18:38,"and then dropping them from helicopters over Switzerland,"
00:18:38,00:18:42,"and then foxes eat the chicken heads, and they're immune from rabies."
00:18:42,00:18:45,"And I just think that's ingenious, and it works."
00:18:45,00:18:48,So lots of European countries took this on.
00:18:48,00:18:51,"So I think Germany in the late 1980s said,"
00:18:51,00:18:54,"""Okay, it's a bit weird and barbaric that you're doing this whole chicken head thing."""
00:18:54,00:18:58,"So they manufactured just little fish pellets and dropped them instead with the vaccine in,"
00:18:58,00:19:00,and it turned out that worked as well.
00:19:00,00:19:02,"Yeah, it's not as cool though."
00:19:02,00:19:07,Imagine being in a helicopter with a sack of chicken heads.
00:19:07,00:19:10,You'd feel like the king of the world.
00:19:10,00:19:19,"But the worst thing is, oh, the king of the world is flying over us."
00:19:19,00:19:21,I wonder what he's got to distribute.
00:19:21,00:19:26,"But they did, they, before they worked out the chicken head thing,"
00:19:26,00:19:29,they did try other options of how to vaccinate foxes.
00:19:29,00:19:31,"And one of the things, it was called the vac trap."
00:19:31,00:19:34,And it was basically the equivalent of a bear trap.
00:19:34,00:19:40,"So anything that stood on it would trigger a giant needle that would just go ""quang it into them"""
00:19:40,00:19:42,and inject them.
00:19:42,00:19:46,And they had to stop because too many hikers kept walking along.
00:19:46,00:19:49,It's suddenly getting walloped by a needle.
00:19:49,00:19:52,But did you see that they actually didn't stop because of their hikers?
00:19:52,00:19:56,"Because they were concerned, the people who manufactured it, that that would be a problem."
00:19:56,00:20:00,"And you know, people are getting vaccinated against rabies they don't have when they're on a walk."
00:20:00,00:20:05,"And they set these traps on a, this is in the US, they did this."
00:20:05,00:20:08,"They set these traps on a beach, which was a deserted beach."
00:20:08,00:20:11,And they thought this was a good place to test out our vaccine.
00:20:11,00:20:16,And it turned out that the US Navy was planning to use that deserted beach a few days later
00:20:16,00:20:20,to promote invasion as a training exercise for all of its soldiers.
00:20:20,00:20:24,And so the people who'd set them offered to remove them.
00:20:24,00:20:29,And officials argued that the hazards would serve as an additional measure of the invaders prowess.
00:20:29,00:20:34,"So the, the rabies vaccine was invented by Louis Pasteur."
00:20:34,00:20:35,Yeah.
00:20:35,00:20:39,"A few other people as well, but he's like the headline guy, really."
00:20:39,00:20:43,One of the things that he did in the lab is he would get some saliva from a rabid dog.
00:20:43,00:20:46,And then he would use that for his experiments.
00:20:46,00:20:52,But unlike everyone else who kind of used kind of gloves and I don't know how it sold classes.
00:20:52,00:20:53,11 people use.
00:20:53,00:20:57,He just went straight in there and just went up to the rabid dog.
00:20:57,00:21:00,"And just got the saliva out of there, right?"
00:21:00,00:21:05,"Which is pretty brave considering that if you got bitten, the protocol was to be shot immediately."
00:21:05,00:21:09,"If you got bitten, you just got shot."
00:21:09,00:21:11,That's fierce predical.
00:21:11,00:21:12,That is hard car.
00:21:12,00:21:18,"I read that he sucked the saliva from the mouth of a rabid dog, which was sort of secured on a laptop."
00:21:18,00:21:23,"And he's supposedly using a pipette held in his mouth, which seems needlessly."
00:21:23,00:21:27,It seems needlessly bravado-ish.
00:21:27,00:21:32,It kind of feels like he's the bear grills of his day.
00:21:32,00:21:33,It's amazing.
00:21:33,00:21:35,On necessary feats of apparent courage.
00:21:35,00:21:37,"Well, I have a fact about air drops."
00:21:37,00:21:38,Okay.
00:21:38,00:21:40,And animal air drops.
00:21:40,00:21:48,So wasps pick up ants when they're competing over food and drop them away from the food.
00:21:48,00:21:50,This is true.
00:21:50,00:21:56,Researchers observed this in the world and then they tested it on a real situation.
00:21:56,00:21:58,So they put out some tuna.
00:21:58,00:22:02,They let some ants go and start eating the tuna and then they release some wasps.
00:22:02,00:22:05,And sometimes the ants will attack the wasp.
00:22:05,00:22:08,"And even though they're much smaller, they can spray former acid and stuff."
00:22:08,00:22:15,"And so sometimes the wasps just pick up the ants, fly them away from the tuna, drop them and then go back to the tuna."
00:22:15,00:22:19,Imagine if you're flying around and just dropping ants anywhere you want to.
00:22:19,00:22:24,You'd feel like King of the World.
00:22:24,00:22:31,I regret sharing my fun to see with you.
00:22:31,00:22:34,"It's possible that the ants could enjoy that, are they right?"
00:22:34,00:22:39,"It's like my meal was interrupted, but it was fun paragliding."
00:22:39,00:22:48,"That's actually small enough. There's a certain size of animal. Once you get small enough, you probably wouldn't die because your maximum velocity you can reach is not high enough to squish you."
00:22:48,00:22:50,"I think even mice, you can drop from really high height."
00:22:50,00:22:53,They're not heavy enough to hurt them properly.
00:22:53,00:22:54,Okay.
00:22:54,00:22:58,Horses on the other hand.
00:22:58,00:23:01,I have a chicken fact.
00:23:01,00:23:10,Pond Square in Highgate in London is haunted by a half frozen chicken.
00:23:10,00:23:15,"Oh, I know who's chicken that is."
00:23:15,00:23:20,"So for a very long time, there's been a half frozen chicken that's been haunting this pond."
00:23:20,00:23:24,"And everyone has been sort of going, oh, there's a half frozen chicken."
00:23:24,00:23:38,"And it turns out that the half frozen chicken belonged to a man called Francis Bacon, who if you remember, died when he was experimenting on which bit don't you believe when you're shaking your head?"
00:23:38,00:23:43,"First of all, he supposedly died of a chill after stuffing a chicken with snow, didn't he?"
00:23:43,00:23:45,"I don't think that's true, first of all."
00:23:45,00:23:49,"And then the rest of it, obviously, I don't think that's true either."
00:23:49,00:23:57,"Why would the chicken horn highgate, though, that's what Francis Bacon might horn highgate, but the chicken was already dead, I think."
00:23:57,00:24:00,I know it's a really odd situation.
00:24:00,00:24:04,"So chicken heads can help pro athletes, actually."
00:24:04,00:24:08,And this is real. There's a guy called...
00:24:08,00:24:11,Ouch. Wow.
00:24:11,00:24:15,It's a terrible burn on everything we've heard so far.
00:24:15,00:24:22,"No, chicken heads can help pro athletes. There's a guy called Hans Wilhelm Mula Wolfart."
00:24:22,00:24:27,He was the doctor from Bayern Munich until quite recently when he got fired.
00:24:27,00:24:34,But he used to inject an extract of chicken heads into the kind of tendons of athletes to help them.
00:24:34,00:24:37,There's a little bit of evidence that it might work.
00:24:37,00:24:44,"He treated Mike Lowen, Stephen Gerard, Usain Bolt, Paula Radcliffe, Bono."
00:24:44,00:24:49,So five great athletes of our time.
00:24:49,00:24:53,"But he got fired quite recently, and he is quite controversial."
00:24:53,00:24:59,He once prescribed goat's blood injections into a striker from a football team.
00:24:59,00:25:03,"But because he's called Hans, he's known as Healing Hans."
00:25:03,00:25:05,"But he is quite famous, actually."
00:25:05,00:25:08,Do you guys know about cooking? No.
00:25:08,00:25:13,"Okay, I'm glad. Apparently this is a social media phenomenon where you cook."
00:25:13,00:25:19,"And it's kind of like planking, but instead of lying flat and impersonating your plank in front of the camera,"
00:25:19,00:25:22,you pretend to be a frozen chicken carcass in public.
00:25:22,00:25:26,Do you have to pour on the high gate?
00:25:26,00:25:28,You can actually do it anyway.
00:25:28,00:25:34,So all you have to do is take all of your clothes off and then crouch down and then have a photo taken of yourself
00:25:34,00:25:37,and then a naked person crouch down in a fetal position sort of on their knees.
00:25:37,00:25:40,"Looks like a chicken, a chicken carcass."
00:25:40,00:25:47,How does someone sat the naked look like a chicken any more than a centurion?
00:25:47,00:25:49,Good point.
00:25:49,00:25:54,"No, so okay, so if you were just very quickly, if you were going sort of profile"
00:25:54,00:25:57,"and you were leaning on your knees and you were leaning over,"
00:25:57,00:26:01,a human in that position looks remarkably like a frozen chicken.
00:26:01,00:26:05,So many mistakes on Christmas Day.
00:26:05,00:26:11,"Can I, this fact has the element of talking about these were dropped from helicopters."
00:26:11,00:26:14,I started looking into helicopters slightly.
00:26:14,00:26:20,Do you know that the world's biggest helicopter can carry it big enough that it can carry a plane?
00:26:20,00:26:22,"Wow, it's nice."
00:26:22,00:26:23,No way.
00:26:23,00:26:25,Do you know when the earliest helicopter was?
00:26:25,00:26:26,No.
00:26:26,00:26:28,"Da Vinci supposedly had one, did he?"
00:26:28,00:26:29,He drew one.
00:26:29,00:26:30,"He designed one, yes."
00:26:30,00:26:35,But it wasn't as early as the helicopter that was invented in 400 BC by the Chinese.
00:26:35,00:26:36,What?
00:26:36,00:26:40,"Which, because officially, so this was, it was called the Bamboo Copter, apparently,"
00:26:40,00:26:42,which stresses me out.
00:26:42,00:26:46,"I think I might have mentioned on the podcast before that one of my favourite etymologies is helicopter,"
00:26:46,00:26:50,because it's the etymology is so unusually split up.
00:26:50,00:26:53,"So it's helicos, which is a spiral and a poteir,"
00:26:53,00:26:57,"which you wouldn't expect to be a word on its own, which is like the wing."
00:26:57,00:27:01,"So by saying Bamboo Copter, they've stomped right in the middle of that word helicos."
00:27:01,00:27:03,You should never say anything copter.
00:27:03,00:27:06,It should be either pter or helicos.
00:27:06,00:27:07,Exactly.
00:27:07,00:27:08,"Yeah, I feel your pain, Anna."
00:27:08,00:27:14,"Yeah, I've written a strongly worded letter to ancient Chinese emperors."
00:27:14,00:27:18,You know a very popular escape from prisoners via helicopter.
00:27:18,00:27:21,"I mean, popular."
00:27:21,00:27:22,To find popular.
00:27:22,00:27:26,"It seems to be, so people actually do it more often than you would think."
00:27:26,00:27:31,France holds the record for most prison escapes via helicopter.
00:27:31,00:27:36,"And that's 11, so actually not as much as I was, as I was saying earlier."
00:27:36,00:27:37,"Oh, sorry."
00:27:37,00:27:39,It's epidemic proportions.
00:27:39,00:27:43,"But there's a guy with the world record for most helicopter escapes from prison,"
00:27:43,00:27:44,which is three.
00:27:44,00:27:47,"He escaped in 2001, 2003, 2007."
00:27:47,00:27:51,"And at no point did someone go, we should watch out for this guy every time he goes into the yard."
00:27:51,00:27:54,"I say let's put a roof on Davies, so I say we should."
00:27:54,00:27:56,"OK, time for our final fact."
00:27:56,00:27:58,And that is Andrew Hunter Murray.
00:27:58,00:28:07,"My fact is that in 2015, a 10-year study concluded that punching glass is very dangerous."
00:28:07,00:28:11,"Wasn't the only thing they found out, but it was pretty much the headline."
00:28:11,00:28:16,"There was a study by a group of Australian doctors, and they concluded in about July this year."
00:28:16,00:28:22,"They measured everyone who came into a particular hospital from 2003 to 2012, collected lots of data."
00:28:22,00:28:27,"And they said that it is really, really dangerous to punch glass."
00:28:27,00:28:29,And they found out other things.
00:28:29,00:28:34,They found out that the typical patient who punches glass is a 26-year-old single male
00:28:34,00:28:37,who is unemployed and intoxicated.
00:28:37,00:28:49,"Of the 137 people that they found who punched glass, 113 women, 122 were single."
00:28:49,00:28:54,95 were unemployed and 91 were drunk.
00:28:54,00:29:00,"Wow, and they have one conclusion as well, which is how to deal with this thing."
00:29:00,00:29:06,"Preventing young, intoxicated males from aiming punches at glass is a difficult task."
00:29:06,00:29:16,"And perhaps the only rational method, although costly, is to replace all glass within arms reach with safety glass."
00:29:16,00:29:21,Now more glass for you.
00:29:21,00:29:22,That's amazing.
00:29:22,00:29:27,I think it might be cheaper to replace all drunk men with so many.
00:29:27,00:29:31,"This was in Australia, but there was another study in Sunderland."
00:29:31,00:29:36,"And there were only 67 patients in this one, but it was in Sunderland."
00:29:36,00:29:41,And so England's Australia.
00:29:41,00:29:48,"Well, they found that all of the people had consumed alcohol."
00:29:48,00:29:51,So it's dangerous. Why is it dangerous?
00:29:51,00:29:54,"Well, Anna."
00:29:54,00:29:57,Because you can mess your hand up real bad.
00:29:57,00:30:00,Like the glass breaks and then a glass gets into your stomach.
00:30:00,00:30:03,I was wondering if there were any more complex conclusions in that your hand.
00:30:03,00:30:06,So it was just that people got injured a lot.
00:30:06,00:30:11,"People say that 'cause I put my hand through a window once, but I wasn't even drunk."
00:30:11,00:30:14,You were drunk on 26 a male every time.
00:30:14,00:30:16,I actually wasn't any of those things.
00:30:16,00:30:19,But I remembered the fact that I was about a 15.
00:30:19,00:30:24,"I remember that people had said that the time people must get injured is when they retract their arm, when they've broken glass,"
00:30:24,00:30:26,because that's when it slices up against you.
00:30:26,00:30:35,"And so I held my hand suspended out with a window and I was in my family and I was like, ""Daddy, what do I do now?"""
00:30:35,00:30:40,"But I didn't even lose two. Well, I held my arm through the hole in the glass until my dad came upstairs"
00:30:40,00:30:43,"and went, ""You can't pull your hand out of the glass now."""
00:30:43,00:30:44,And it was absolutely fine.
00:30:44,00:30:46,"And you would have that presence of mine to think,"
00:30:46,00:30:49,"""I remember reading a paper about this guy."""
00:30:49,00:30:58,And thus was a QI researcher born.
00:30:58,00:31:04,I was researching great bits of glass just to see...
00:31:04,00:31:06,Just to see what was considered to be...
00:31:06,00:31:11,And thus was a great QI researcher not born.
00:31:11,00:31:13,"Yeah, so I was looking into great bits of glass."
00:31:13,00:31:18,"And then I came across a whole sort of, ""Did you mean great bits of glass to stand on?"""
00:31:18,00:31:21,And so I started reading into great bits of glass to stand on.
00:31:21,00:31:24,"Now, one of the best bits of glass to stand on."
00:31:24,00:31:29,"And it's not a typo glass, but it's an achievement if you ever get to stand on this."
00:31:29,00:31:35,"There's actually, at the bottom of the International Space Station, so I know in a gravityless place,"
00:31:35,00:31:38,"there can't really be a bottom, but it's the bit that's facing Earth."
00:31:38,00:31:41,They actually have a glass floor that you can stand on.
00:31:41,00:31:46,"So, yeah, so you push yourself up to it and there's photos of astronauts looking down,"
00:31:46,00:31:48,so they can see all of Earth below their feet.
00:31:48,00:31:52,Which is really nice. I've not heard that before as an International Space Station.
00:31:52,00:31:55,"And it reminded me that in the Grand Canyon,"
00:31:55,00:31:59,"you can actually go on a thing called the Skywalk now, which is really amazing."
00:31:59,00:32:02,So it's this incredible bit that hangs over the Grand Canyon.
00:32:02,00:32:05,It's complete glass and you just look down as you're looking over.
00:32:05,00:32:08,"When they opened it, they wanted some spectacular people to walk on it."
00:32:08,00:32:13,"And they asked Buzz Aldrin, ""Would you be one of the two first people to do it?"""
00:32:13,00:32:18,"And there was another astronaut there, a guy who's the only Native American astronaut,"
00:32:18,00:32:19,a part Native American astronaut.
00:32:19,00:32:21,"Oh, don't tell me the buzz was the second person."
00:32:21,00:32:26,They were meant to meet up at the middle and Buzz stopped to do a salute at the guy got there first.
00:32:26,00:32:31,"So he's the second, once again, the second man to make it to something."
00:32:31,00:32:32,"Oh, no."
00:32:32,00:32:34,On punching.
00:32:34,00:32:35,"Yeah, yeah."
00:32:35,00:32:41,"So, recent research has just been done into the human fist."
00:32:41,00:32:46,And there is a suggestion and one scientist strongly believes on the basis of this research
00:32:46,00:32:49,that the human fist was evolved for punching.
00:32:49,00:32:53,"So we think that humans are superior to all other beings,"
00:32:53,00:32:57,because we evolved with our dexterous hands for writing or for whatever.
00:32:57,00:32:59,We actually evolved to beat each other up.
00:32:59,00:33:01,And it turns out we're much more well adapted.
00:33:01,00:33:05,"Our fist, the fact that they fit our fingers fit so well into the palm of our hands,"
00:33:05,00:33:07,that really is ideal for punch-ups.
00:33:07,00:33:11,"So the idea is that an opposable thumb you could use to grab something,"
00:33:11,00:33:16,"but you can also use it to kind of buttress your fist to properly hit someone, right?"
00:33:16,00:33:20,"Hold it down. And nature's being defensive as well as aggressive,"
00:33:20,00:33:24,because apparently males have evolved to be punched.
00:33:24,00:33:27,"Before you go any further, I have not."
00:33:27,00:33:31,Your face says otherwise.
00:33:33,00:33:47,"So, what was on the head with some applause over there?"
00:33:47,00:33:53,"Do you know that the World Record most punches, quickest punches, this is ridiculous, by the way."
00:33:53,00:33:57,But the most punches in 15 seconds is 200.
00:33:57,00:33:59,No way!
00:33:59,00:34:03,I think he was hitting like... 200 guys.
00:34:03,00:34:09,"Yeah, he was hitting a punch bag, I think."
00:34:09,00:34:13,Do you know there's a robot that they've trained to punch humans?
00:34:13,00:34:15,Why would you do that?
00:34:15,00:34:19,"We've all seen Terminator 2, we know that it's..."
00:34:19,00:34:25,"This is a Frownhofer-IFF Institute in Germany,"
00:34:25,00:34:27,and they've invented a robot that punches people.
00:34:27,00:34:33,And the idea is that you contest how hard it has to hit a human before it hurts.
00:34:33,00:34:39,"Wow, these guys are idiots, and they're going to be the first against the wall when the robot turns."
00:34:39,00:34:45,They have like an ultrasound scanner that can tell whether you're bruising or not before you actually bruise.
00:34:45,00:34:52,"And the idea, according to them, is that it's going to stop in the future from humans being injured by robots."
00:34:52,00:34:56,"So we're prepping for Frownhofer, that's amazing."
00:34:56,00:35:00,"You know that you also, when you donate your body to science,"
00:35:00,00:35:06,"and you can read up now on how many different ways they sort of take you apart and use different bits for different things,"
00:35:06,00:35:12,one of the things is that they'll take your arm now and just have it punching a punching bag constantly to see why we punch.
00:35:12,00:35:14,"Wow, that's amazing."
00:35:14,00:35:18,"There's another one where you can become like a crash test dummy, can't you?"
00:35:18,00:35:24,"Because a normal crash test dummy is quite hard to get a real, you can't make it really like a human,"
00:35:24,00:35:30,"but if you put a human in there and then see how they react to being in a crash, then that really, really does help science."
00:35:30,00:35:32,It's an amazing tool.
00:35:32,00:35:38,"It's like, if you've done anything bad ass in your actual life, I think saying, writing on your donor card at the bottom,"
00:35:38,00:35:42,"please preference for crash test dummy, it is the way to go."
00:35:42,00:35:46,I would like my head to be thrown out of a helicopter.
00:35:46,00:35:52,"Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening."
00:35:52,00:36:02,"If you would like to get in contact with any of us about the things we've said over the course of this past cast,"
00:36:02,00:36:06,"we could be found on our Twitter account, so I'm on @Sriberland, James."
00:36:06,00:36:08,"@Xshaped, Andy."
00:36:08,00:36:10,Andrew Hunter M. Chazinski.
00:36:10,00:36:18,"@Sriberland, James."
00:36:18,00:36:22,"Thank you so much for listening. Thank you so much for being here, guys."
00:36:22,00:36:24,Goodbye.
00:36:24,00:36:34,(Applause)
