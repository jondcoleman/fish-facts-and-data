00:00:14,00:00:19,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of Most of Things A Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:19,00:00:22,to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:00:22,00:00:26,"My name is Andrew Hunter Murray, and I am sitting here with James Harkin, Anna Tajinski,"
00:00:26,00:00:31,"and Alex Bell, and once again we have gathered around these microphones to tell you our"
00:00:31,00:00:34,four favourite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:34,00:00:40,"So, in no particular order, here we go, starting with fact number one, and this week that"
00:00:40,00:00:41,is James.
00:00:41,00:00:47,"Okay, my fact this week is that when a prince in the Byzantine Empire was ready to marry,"
00:00:47,00:00:52,caught officials would walk around the land with an imperial shoe that they used to check
00:00:52,00:00:54,the foot size of potential princesses.
00:00:54,00:00:55,That is amazing.
00:00:55,00:00:56,It's amazing.
00:00:56,00:01:00,"I mean, I can't really believe that."
00:01:00,00:01:02,"No, it sounds very much like a fairy tale."
00:01:02,00:01:03,"Yeah, it does."
00:01:03,00:01:04,It's just my wife or something.
00:01:04,00:01:05,Yeah.
00:01:05,00:01:06,I jack up the Beanstalk.
00:01:06,00:01:07,Yeah.
00:01:07,00:01:12,"So, does everyone do you think know what the Byzantine Empire was?"
00:01:12,00:01:15,I did not until I started researching this fact.
00:01:15,00:01:19,"So it is otherwise known as the Eastern Roman Empire, and the Roman Empire kind of split"
00:01:19,00:01:23,"into two towards the end, and they had the Western side and the Eastern side."
00:01:23,00:01:27,"So this was around Turkey and around the Balkans, as they are today."
00:01:27,00:01:28,Yes.
00:01:28,00:01:30,"In fact, they never called themselves Byzantins, did they?"
00:01:30,00:01:31,Or Byzantines.
00:01:31,00:01:33,They always called themselves Romans.
00:01:33,00:01:38,"So apparently what would happen is when the prince wanted to marry, caught officials would"
00:01:38,00:01:43,"go around not just with this shoe, but also with a painting of a perfect or ideal match"
00:01:43,00:01:47,"that they should look like, and they try and find the perfect woman for him."
00:01:47,00:01:49,"This is like a manual tinder, then."
00:01:49,00:01:53,"I suppose so, but what if you're a terrible artist, for instance, and you're not very"
00:01:53,00:01:54,good at faces?
00:01:54,00:01:55,So you have the same problem with tinder.
00:01:55,00:01:59,"You've got people with the Instagram filters that completely distort, you know, it's so nice"
00:01:59,00:02:00,having a young person here.
00:02:00,00:02:01,It's my choice.
00:02:01,00:02:04,"I'm the only single person on the table on that, yeah."
00:02:04,00:02:09,"And I read this in the OUP blog, so it's Oxford University Press blog, and there's a whole"
00:02:09,00:02:12,thing about amazing facts about Byzantine Empire.
00:02:12,00:02:13,It is.
00:02:13,00:02:14,I'd never heard of this.
00:02:14,00:02:17,"There were wife shows, weren't they?"
00:02:17,00:02:20,"And they would, you know, put these women on display."
00:02:20,00:02:24,"So it sounds like they would choose sometimes a, sort of, a lineup of women, so the mother"
00:02:24,00:02:27,"of the prince would dispatch, you know, some emissaries to go around the empire, measuring"
00:02:27,00:02:32,"up these women, and then pick the favourite 13, and then bring them back."
00:02:32,00:02:36,"And then there'd be sort of a bride show where they'd all, you know, they'd all be brought"
00:02:36,00:02:40,"to podium, and then they could press their buttons to take themselves out of the game."
00:02:40,00:02:41,Exactly.
00:02:41,00:02:45,"I'm trying a very labored way to describe the show, take me out, which I've never seen."
00:02:45,00:02:46,"And I, obviously, am flailing."
00:02:46,00:02:51,"I'd say it's more like an episode of the Bachelor, so the Emperor Theophilus had the Golden Apple,"
00:02:51,00:02:53,which he would then give to the winning bride.
00:02:53,00:02:55,"It's, I mean, it's literally the Bachelor."
00:02:55,00:02:58,We're talking about shows that I've never heard of.
00:02:58,00:03:01,How similar was it to blind date?
00:03:01,00:03:02,Quite similar.
00:03:02,00:03:03,Is it?
00:03:03,00:03:06,"Yeah, except the man behind the screen has the power to kill you if he doesn't like you."
00:03:06,00:03:07,Okay.
00:03:07,00:03:11,There's another thing about Byzantine wife finding for royalty.
00:03:11,00:03:15,This is from a book called A Cabinet of Byzantine Curiosities.
00:03:15,00:03:21,"And the finalists who were the potential brides selected for the Emperor, they were sometimes"
00:03:21,00:03:24,"examined, nude in the bath, by the prince's mum."
00:03:24,00:03:26,"Ah, so that's a bit like that."
00:03:26,00:03:29,"Another show where, what's it called, where everyone's naked, and you..."
00:03:29,00:03:30,"Oh, naked attraction."
00:03:30,00:03:31,Yeah.
00:03:31,00:03:32,Yes.
00:03:32,00:03:33,It is like that.
00:03:33,00:03:37,All Channel 4 formats are taken from the Byzantine Empire.
00:03:37,00:03:40,"I think that was Theophano, wasn't it?"
00:03:40,00:03:44,I think it was just one mother who was particularly keen on getting the right woman who...
00:03:44,00:03:45,Embarrassed.
00:03:45,00:03:46,I know.
00:03:46,00:03:50,"She put the final three in the bath, and then she draped a golden robe around the one whose"
00:03:50,00:03:52,body presumably she thought was the most beautiful.
00:03:52,00:03:53,Wait a minute.
00:03:53,00:03:57,"Wasn't there another show where someone went on a date, and their parents were watching"
00:03:57,00:03:59,"the date, and they got to choose who had the date?"
00:03:59,00:04:00,I think that...
00:04:00,00:04:02,I think there's a BBC 3 format based on that.
00:04:02,00:04:03,Yeah.
00:04:03,00:04:04,That's called Sun Sex and Suspicious Parents.
00:04:04,00:04:06,"No, that's a slightly different one."
00:04:06,00:04:08,I don't care if I didn't watch these.
00:04:08,00:04:09,I just work in television.
00:04:09,00:04:14,"That's the one where the parents go on holiday, secretly observe their children."
00:04:14,00:04:17,"They're being raucous abroad, and then they confront them at the end."
00:04:17,00:04:22,I don't know if we'll be talking about a great historic civilization and empire in this
00:04:22,00:04:23,podcast.
00:04:23,00:04:24,We are Channel 4.
00:04:24,00:04:30,"But that would be so fitting, because it was always the mum, right?"
00:04:30,00:04:33,"The son had no choice in it, it seemed like it was always the mother who'd go out and"
00:04:33,00:04:34,select the...
00:04:34,00:04:37,She was very much the executive producer of these mountains.
00:04:37,00:04:43,"I looked into whether Byzantium was Byzantine, you know, whether the word Byzantine is..."
00:04:43,00:04:45,"Because it's complicated by Byzantine, you know, that's what it means."
00:04:45,00:04:46,And they...
00:04:46,00:04:49,Was it an especially complicated place?
00:04:49,00:04:53,"It was quite complicated, but only compared with Western Europe at the time where you just"
00:04:53,00:04:55,had a load of feudal lords and things.
00:04:55,00:04:58,And there were a load of behavioral codes about where you could sit at Royal Bankwits and
00:04:58,00:05:01,what you could talk about and who you could talk to.
00:05:01,00:05:06,"But actually, compared with modern, for example, derivatives companies, then it's actually"
00:05:06,00:05:07,quite simple.
00:05:07,00:05:08,So it's complicated.
00:05:08,00:05:12,It's also the Facebook stages of most of the royal marriages given that...
00:05:12,00:05:15,"Yeah, my stepmother picked her out of the bar for me."
00:05:15,00:05:20,"I read that Byzantine in the way that we use it in common parlance has negative connotations,"
00:05:20,00:05:25,"obviously, and that that was partly because the Empire was portrayed not only as complicated,"
00:05:25,00:05:28,but as quite secretive and lots of lascivious stuff was going on.
00:05:28,00:05:33,And so one example of this was they were interquite a lot of sexual things that the West didn't
00:05:33,00:05:34,appreciate.
00:05:34,00:05:39,And one of these things was recorded by a historian who wrote a very famous book at the time
00:05:39,00:05:44,"called The Secret History, and it was about Emperor Justinian's wife, Theodora, who used"
00:05:44,00:05:49,to dance around naked in this huge atrium in front of lots of people in this theatre.
00:05:49,00:05:53,"And she'd just have a ribbon round her waist because it was actually legal to be fully naked,"
00:05:53,00:05:54,ribbon round her waist.
00:05:54,00:05:59,And then she would lie on the ground and have slaves drop grain on her torso and other
00:05:59,00:06:00,parts from above.
00:06:00,00:06:06,And then she'd have a herd of geese fly in and peck the grain of her nude body.
00:06:06,00:06:07,Wow.
00:06:07,00:06:10,It would be a skeen of geese if it was flying in.
00:06:10,00:06:11,Sorry.
00:06:11,00:06:12,"Oh, yeah."
00:06:12,00:06:13,Thanks for that.
00:06:13,00:06:14,I think landed and walked over.
00:06:14,00:06:15,They'd become a gaggle of geese.
00:06:15,00:06:16,They become a gaggle.
00:06:16,00:06:17,Yeah.
00:06:17,00:06:19,"You were really in your focusing on the wrong aspects of the story, here you go."
00:06:19,00:06:22,"You were a massive kill during a strip club, aren't you?"
00:06:22,00:06:25,"So the geese are pecking at her bits, are they?"
00:06:25,00:06:26,I believe so.
00:06:26,00:06:27,Yeah.
00:06:27,00:06:29,There's some question mark over how true this account is.
00:06:29,00:06:32,I think this guy has sort of fallen out with her and Justinian at this point.
00:06:32,00:06:36,"You know when you go to St. James's Park and you want to feed the geese, and you throw"
00:06:36,00:06:40,"bits of like bread there, not bread, because they don't like bread, but you throw stuff"
00:06:40,00:06:41,at them.
00:06:41,00:06:43,"And then always the pigeons come in and eat it, don't they?"
00:06:43,00:06:49,"She reckons she was late, and the pigeons just can't live with that a bit since then."
00:06:49,00:06:52,"He doesn't recall that, but it can only have been the case."
00:06:52,00:06:53,Is that sexy?
00:06:53,00:06:54,Having pigeons.
00:06:54,00:06:59,"For anyone, no, even the geese, I would say."
00:06:59,00:07:00,Geese are very aggressive.
00:07:00,00:07:01,I would have thought it would be very unpleasant.
00:07:01,00:07:02,I would.
00:07:02,00:07:03,Just one would be bad.
00:07:03,00:07:04,Yeah.
00:07:04,00:07:05,Oh my God.
00:07:05,00:07:06,I don't think.
00:07:06,00:07:10,I'm not sure if I'll do it down there.
00:07:10,00:07:13,Here's the thing about Byzantine Empire.
00:07:13,00:07:17,"It was around the same time as the Norman Conquest, it was happening."
00:07:17,00:07:22,"And when the Norman Conquest happened, a load of Anglo-Saxons from Britain became refugees"
00:07:22,00:07:25,and left Britain.
00:07:25,00:07:27,And they traveled down into Europe.
00:07:27,00:07:32,And they got to the Byzantine Empire where they kind of became citizens.
00:07:32,00:07:38,"And they lived around the Black Sea around Crimea, which it is today, and apparently they called"
00:07:38,00:07:39,it New England.
00:07:39,00:07:40,Really?
00:07:40,00:07:43,"So that's where the first New England was, yeah."
00:07:43,00:07:44,That's so cool.
00:07:44,00:07:45,That is amazing.
00:07:45,00:07:46,"It's interesting, isn't it?"
00:07:46,00:07:51,Imagining basically the British becoming refugees and kind of going down to living Crimea
00:07:51,00:07:53,given all the modern day.
00:07:53,00:07:54,Yeah.
00:07:54,00:07:55,Things happen.
00:07:55,00:07:56,Yeah.
00:07:56,00:07:59,"Wow, and it would have been a much more progressive place then than old Anglo-Saxon just"
00:07:59,00:08:01,"conquered England, which was a nightmare."
00:08:01,00:08:03,I've got a couple of facts about matchmaking.
00:08:03,00:08:04,Yeah.
00:08:04,00:08:09,"So in 1924, there was a magazine called Science and Invention, and it said that to match a couple"
00:08:09,00:08:15,"up properly, one test that you should conduct was firing a gun in the air behind them"
00:08:15,00:08:18,when neither of them knew about it.
00:08:18,00:08:22,"And it's to test whether they're calm under pressure, because apparently in every couple"
00:08:22,00:08:25,you want someone who can remain calm under pressure.
00:08:25,00:08:28,"And if they both react nervously, then they shouldn't get married."
00:08:28,00:08:29,That's interesting.
00:08:29,00:08:34,"I thought it would be that they were like, oh, we're all going to die, and then they kind"
00:08:34,00:08:36,of jump into each other's arms kind of thing.
00:08:36,00:08:40,"Yeah, to see who jumps in front of them, like in friends when Joey jumps in front of a sandwich"
00:08:40,00:08:41,when a car backfires.
00:08:41,00:08:42,Yes.
00:08:42,00:08:43,Yes.
00:08:43,00:08:46,I would have thought it's quite good survival instinct to try and jump out of the way if you
00:08:46,00:08:48,"hear a gun being fired, though."
00:08:48,00:08:51,And I would say you don't want two people in a couple who just stand there and let the
00:08:51,00:08:52,bullet penetrate their bodies.
00:08:52,00:08:53,That is true.
00:08:53,00:08:54,Sorry.
00:08:54,00:08:57,It's how they react to an extreme loud noise really close by.
00:08:57,00:09:01,"It's not, you don't have to fire a gun, ask anyone for this demonstration to work."
00:09:01,00:09:03,How have he died in this experiment?
00:09:03,00:09:07,This would be another great channel for full management.
00:09:07,00:09:13,"I have one fact about Cinderella's glass slippers, which was that in 2015, a scientific study"
00:09:13,00:09:18,"was published in the Journal of Physics Special Topics, which worked out how practical the"
00:09:18,00:09:19,slippers would have been.
00:09:19,00:09:25,"And it based on a weight of 55 kilograms of Cinderella and a size full foot, she only"
00:09:25,00:09:28,"would have been able to wear the slippers if she stood completely still, because if she"
00:09:28,00:09:31,"tried to run away from the prints in them, they would have immediately shattered."
00:09:31,00:09:34,"But that's why they fell off when she ran away, and that's why, like, it wasn't worth it."
00:09:34,00:09:35,"Oh, right."
00:09:35,00:09:37,They thought of that in the story.
00:09:37,00:09:39,"But actually, she wouldn't have been able to walk anyway, she would have to stand exactly"
00:09:39,00:09:40,still.
00:09:40,00:09:44,"The only way it would have worked is if they heels were 1.15 centimetres tall, which is"
00:09:44,00:09:45,not very high.
00:09:45,00:09:49,There's an Italian version of Cinderella from the 19th century.
00:09:49,00:09:53,"Well, it's from earlier than that, but it was first recorded in a book about Cinderella"
00:09:53,00:09:56,stories from the 1890s.
00:09:56,00:10:01,"And that version has Cinderella being born inside a squash, like a button at squash."
00:10:01,00:10:05,"So her mother gives birth to her, but she thinks she's just given birth to a squash."
00:10:05,00:10:07,And so she abandons her in the woods.
00:10:07,00:10:11,"And then the prints walks by, and by that time Cinderella inside the squash has learned"
00:10:11,00:10:12,to talk.
00:10:12,00:10:15,"So the prints walks past and says, oh, it's with, it's a talking pumpkin."
00:10:15,00:10:18,And so then he takes it home with him.
00:10:18,00:10:24,"And I would argue this is a different story, like there's no detail so far that correlates."
00:10:24,00:10:26,"Well, there's the pumpkin thing."
00:10:26,00:10:30,"And then eventually she breaks out of the squash and acts as his servant, and then she goes"
00:10:30,00:10:35,"to a ball he's holding dressed up as a princess, and he falls in love with her and they get married."
00:10:35,00:10:39,"And it's called, the story is called Zucatina, as in Zucchini."
00:10:39,00:10:40,"Oh, really?"
00:10:40,00:10:41,"You know, related."
00:10:41,00:10:42,"What, presumably?"
00:10:42,00:10:43,Which one's Zucchini again?
00:10:43,00:10:44,Cautier.
00:10:44,00:10:45,Yeah.
00:10:45,00:10:46,"Also, is she in a courgette?"
00:10:46,00:10:47,"No, it says she's in a button at squash."
00:10:47,00:10:49,"I guess they're all related, I say."
00:10:49,00:10:50,"Family, yeah."
00:10:50,00:10:51,Same family.
00:10:51,00:10:54,Some sort of legume.
00:10:54,00:11:02,"Okay, it's time for fact number two, and that is Anna."
00:11:02,00:11:08,"Yes, my fact this week is that China has built an exact replica of an Austrian village,"
00:11:08,00:11:11,so that tourists don't have to fly all the way to Austria.
00:11:11,00:11:17,"So this is the, based on the town of Halstadt in Austria, and I think it's the oldest village"
00:11:17,00:11:18,or the oldest town in Austria.
00:11:18,00:11:19,It's really beautiful.
00:11:19,00:11:23,"It's your ideal, when you picture an Austrian village."
00:11:23,00:11:25,It's kind of just really a delic.
00:11:25,00:11:26,Okay.
00:11:26,00:11:27,I'm just picturing that.
00:11:27,00:11:28,Oh.
00:11:28,00:11:29,Oh.
00:11:29,00:11:30,"It's nice, isn't it?"
00:11:30,00:11:31,"Oh, sorry."
00:11:31,00:11:32,I pictured a Swiss one instead.
00:11:32,00:11:33,"Oh, god."
00:11:33,00:11:34,Mine's just sort of Chinese people.
00:11:34,00:11:36,I can't remember.
00:11:36,00:11:42,"So this development was started in China in 2012 in Boluo County, which is sort of in"
00:11:42,00:11:47,"the factory belt, and basically the bunch of Chinese architects were sent to the real town"
00:11:47,00:11:52,"of Halstadt in Cognito, and they went round it, and they took lots of notes, and they did"
00:11:52,00:11:55,"lots of sketches on what it looked like, or took some pictures like this."
00:11:55,00:11:56,"Not in Cognito, is it?"
00:11:56,00:11:57,"Like, don't steal our town."
00:11:57,00:11:59,"Like, why they could have just gone to visit them?"
00:11:59,00:12:00,No one's going to care.
00:12:00,00:12:04,"Well, they might raise suspicions, and then they went back to China, and they started"
00:12:04,00:12:08,"copying it at a very high speed, and it was built within about a year."
00:12:08,00:12:11,And the mayor of the original town found out about halfway through.
00:12:11,00:12:13,And he said he was a bit annoyed at first.
00:12:13,00:12:17,"He said they should have told us, but he's actually really impressed with the town."
00:12:17,00:12:21,"He says it is exactly the same, and he went to the official welcoming ceremony there and"
00:12:21,00:12:22,everything.
00:12:22,00:12:23,So happily ever after.
00:12:23,00:12:24,That's good.
00:12:24,00:12:25,Yeah.
00:12:25,00:12:26,Another fairy tale.
00:12:26,00:12:27,Yeah.
00:12:27,00:12:28,Are they twins?
00:12:28,00:12:29,That would be nice.
00:12:29,00:12:30,"They are twins, yes."
00:12:30,00:12:31,Yes.
00:12:31,00:12:32,Good.
00:12:32,00:12:33,Why did they do this?
00:12:33,00:12:34,Because tourists are traveling.
00:12:34,00:12:38,"Well, I suppose China is quite interested in Western culture, and so they have quite a lot"
00:12:38,00:12:43,"of replicas of other Western buildings, or Western enclave."
00:12:43,00:12:44,Whole other towns.
00:12:44,00:12:45,They've got a replica of Paris.
00:12:45,00:12:46,They've got replica of a Swedish town.
00:12:46,00:12:48,But the idea is that people can live there as well.
00:12:48,00:12:49,You can move in.
00:12:49,00:12:50,So there are lots of people living in this Austrian town.
00:12:50,00:12:51,Yeah.
00:12:51,00:12:52,And I think a lot of them aren't that successful.
00:12:52,00:12:53,And there's a lot of people.
00:12:53,00:12:54,There's a lot of people.
00:12:54,00:12:55,Very nice.
00:12:55,00:12:56,"Well, I guess."
00:12:56,00:13:01,"But the one, the massive one of Paris that they built is basically a ghost town now,"
00:13:01,00:13:02,because it didn't work out.
00:13:02,00:13:04,"There's often this pretty successful, I think, and people actually are living there."
00:13:04,00:13:06,"And it's like a big, gated community."
00:13:06,00:13:07,"Some people live there, yeah."
00:13:07,00:13:08,So it's mainly touristy.
00:13:08,00:13:10,"But the Paris one, I thought, yeah, they didn't quite finish it."
00:13:10,00:13:13,"Although they did build a huge, rifle tower, which is the main bit."
00:13:13,00:13:17,"I just think if you're going to build a new town, like we do that in the UK sometimes, why"
00:13:17,00:13:21,not build it that looks like New Orleans or something?
00:13:21,00:13:22,Why not?
00:13:22,00:13:23,"Yeah, it might as well."
00:13:23,00:13:24,Yeah.
00:13:24,00:13:25,"They're tried and tested, aren't they?"
00:13:25,00:13:26,"Yeah, exactly."
00:13:26,00:13:27,Exactly.
00:13:27,00:13:28,And it's worked for Haustadt.
00:13:28,00:13:32,"This is probably one of the reasons why the mayor is OK with it, because visitors to"
00:13:32,00:13:36,"the real Haustadt since the town was built, have gone from 50 to 1,000 per year from"
00:13:36,00:13:37,China.
00:13:37,00:13:40,And I seem to be the only one who's not completely cool with this wholesale town plagiarism
00:13:40,00:13:41,that's going on.
00:13:41,00:13:42,What?
00:13:42,00:13:43,Why not?
00:13:43,00:13:46,"Because, you know, things should be where they are and nowhere else."
00:13:46,00:13:48,They haven't removed the town from the streets.
00:13:48,00:13:53,"Do you think maybe we should knock down Blackpool Tower, because that was just a copy of"
00:13:53,00:13:54,the Eiffel Tower?
00:13:54,00:13:58,"Oh, well, James, I had not had that brought to my attention before, and yes, I do."
00:13:58,00:14:03,"I think future archaeologists are going to be extremely confused when they come across,"
00:14:03,00:14:05,"you know, the real Paris and then the fake Paris, and they're going to say, well, this"
00:14:05,00:14:09,"seems to be the main civilization, because all of the stuff was here, and then that's"
00:14:09,00:14:10,spread out around the world.
00:14:10,00:14:14,"I get worried about that, actually, because you know how now, obviously, we've fetishised"
00:14:14,00:14:18,"antique stuff and historical stuff, and we build houses in old style, and we have antique"
00:14:18,00:14:21,"furniture, and I worry about archaeologists, a couple of thousand years in the future about"
00:14:21,00:14:22,confusing them.
00:14:22,00:14:26,"You know, going, wait, I thought this house was from the 21st century, but there's a"
00:14:26,00:14:29,"16th century chair in it, and they won't know what to do."
00:14:29,00:14:30,Exactly.
00:14:30,00:14:31,Anyway.
00:14:31,00:14:37,"But this is a kind of thing, which is not unique to Chinese culture, but it is more prevalent"
00:14:37,00:14:38,there.
00:14:38,00:14:42,So there was a study which found that of the articles submitted to the science journal
00:14:42,00:14:47,"at Shiejiang University, 30% of them were plagiarised either partly or wholly, and that's"
00:14:47,00:14:48,quite a high proportion.
00:14:48,00:14:49,Yeah.
00:14:49,00:14:53,"And very few people theorised that it's about the way you learn Chinese characters, you have"
00:14:53,00:14:56,"to learn through copying a repetition, and it's seen completely differently there."
00:14:56,00:14:59,It's not seen as plagiarism to the same extent.
00:14:59,00:15:04,"Yeah, I read that apparently lots of theorists think that it's, as you say, because of the Chinese"
00:15:04,00:15:08,"characters, and it's because it's so difficult to learn so many, that there's not enough creative"
00:15:08,00:15:14,"space left over in Chinese brains for creativity, which seems like the most absurd reason you've"
00:15:14,00:15:15,ever heard.
00:15:15,00:15:19,"First of all, they invented almost everything we had up until about the 16th century, didn't"
00:15:19,00:15:20,they?
00:15:20,00:15:21,Yeah.
00:15:21,00:15:22,And then we copied it.
00:15:22,00:15:23,And then we copied it.
00:15:23,00:15:24,Yeah.
00:15:24,00:15:29,"We should be allowed to use a wheelbarrow, because it was invented by the Chinese."
00:15:29,00:15:32,"Yeah, that's really awkward, because you're now claiming that as the landmark invention,"
00:15:32,00:15:35,which is sort of insulting to some of the other things they did invent.
00:15:35,00:15:36,Do you know what?
00:15:36,00:15:40,I think I could get by the rest of my life never using a wheelbarrow.
00:15:40,00:15:43,This podcast has taken a distinctly brexity flavour.
00:15:43,00:15:46,"Yeah, I didn't mean to."
00:15:46,00:15:47,"But yeah, they do."
00:15:47,00:15:50,"And it's kind of a form of flattery in a way, isn't it?"
00:15:50,00:15:52,It's just that interest in designs over the rest of the world.
00:15:52,00:15:55,I think it seems that imitation is the highest form of flattery.
00:15:55,00:15:57,"That's the difference between wearing similar clothes to someone, and then getting"
00:15:57,00:15:59,plastic surgery for your face looks exactly like them.
00:15:59,00:16:00,It's...
00:16:00,00:16:01,I'd be flattered.
00:16:01,00:16:02,"Feel free, Alex."
00:16:02,00:16:04,But massively wasted out.
00:16:04,00:16:06,Have you heard about the replica Noah's Ark?
00:16:06,00:16:07,No.
00:16:07,00:16:08,No.
00:16:08,00:16:12,"So this was built in America in, oh, when was it finished?"
00:16:12,00:16:17,"It was finished a few years ago, but this decade, and lots of people keep building replica"
00:16:17,00:16:18,Noah's Arks.
00:16:18,00:16:19,But this one is massive.
00:16:19,00:16:26,"It's in Kentucky, and it cost $120 million to build, it's built by this Bible group called"
00:16:26,00:16:27,Answers in Genesis.
00:16:27,00:16:29,So I think they're an online church.
00:16:29,00:16:34,"It took 700 workers, as long as an American football field, it's massive."
00:16:34,00:16:35,How long is that?
00:16:35,00:16:36,100 yards.
00:16:36,00:16:37,100 yards.
00:16:37,00:16:39,And it was built by a man called Ken Ham.
00:16:39,00:16:41,Ham was one of Noah's sites.
00:16:41,00:16:42,"Oh, yeah."
00:16:42,00:16:43,Yeah.
00:16:43,00:16:45,"Also, the first chimpanzee in space."
00:16:45,00:16:49,"Yeah, I don't know which he was named after."
00:16:49,00:16:50,If either.
00:16:50,00:16:53,"But they've got this massive plan, and no one knows what Noah's Ark looked like either,"
00:16:53,00:16:55,but they've insisted it's a replica.
00:16:55,00:16:58,"We have in the Bible, it says how big it is, doesn't it?"
00:16:58,00:17:01,It says the number of qubits by the number of qubits.
00:17:01,00:17:02,Okay.
00:17:02,00:17:03,But yeah.
00:17:03,00:17:04,"And Irving Finkel did that study, didn't he?"
00:17:04,00:17:08,"So he's great at the British Museum, and he did that study that decided it was spherical."
00:17:08,00:17:09,He thinks he's a coracle.
00:17:09,00:17:10,Yeah.
00:17:10,00:17:15,"But his design is based on Babylonian tablets, so not on the Hebrew Bible."
00:17:15,00:17:16,Yeah.
00:17:16,00:17:20,For clearly he wants more massively reliable fare.
00:17:20,00:17:21,"He's working on another thing, Mr. Ham."
00:17:21,00:17:22,"Oh, yeah."
00:17:22,00:17:28,"He's working with his partners on a 10-year plan to build a biblical walled city in Kentucky,"
00:17:28,00:17:31,which is also going to feature a 10 plagues of Egypt ride.
00:17:31,00:17:32,Wow.
00:17:32,00:17:33,That sounds good.
00:17:33,00:17:36,But then did they kill your first boss at the end of the year?
00:17:36,00:17:40,That's the bit where the camera goes off.
00:17:40,00:17:47,"There's another boat, replica boat, in the news at the moment, actually, which is a replica"
00:17:47,00:17:51,of the boat that James Cook used to sail to Australia.
00:17:51,00:17:55,"So that's the endeavor, but that is moving to Whitby."
00:17:55,00:18:00,"So it's been in Stockton on Tees, and it's just been bought by someone for £110,000."
00:18:00,00:18:05,"And it's going to cost them £250,000 to move it 39 miles up the road."
00:18:05,00:18:07,I was going to say it's not far from Whitby to Stockton.
00:18:07,00:18:08,"No, it's not."
00:18:08,00:18:10,It's certainly not written to Australia.
00:18:10,00:18:12,But I think it's the land bit.
00:18:12,00:18:13,There's the problem.
00:18:13,00:18:14,"I mean, if you could sail there."
00:18:14,00:18:15,"Oh, is it going over the land?"
00:18:15,00:18:16,"It has to go over the land a bit, yeah."
00:18:16,00:18:17,I think that has passed the difficulty.
00:18:17,00:18:20,It's oddly expensive to move boats across the land for some reason.
00:18:20,00:18:22,"Well, they're not going to get to Australia like that."
00:18:22,00:18:25,"No, no, they will come across water at some point."
00:18:25,00:18:26,Are they going to resale at Australia?
00:18:26,00:18:30,"No, he's just going to literally move it to Whitby and keep it as a tourist attraction there."
00:18:30,00:18:31,All right.
00:18:31,00:18:33,And I wonder if he was told after he'd made the initial purchase that it was going to cost
00:18:33,00:18:37,"all the £250,000 to move it for where it is."
00:18:37,00:18:44,"On other replica model villages that aren't quite real places, in Gravesend, there's a whole"
00:18:44,00:18:48,"town that's fake, and it's used by police to simulate pretty much any manner of crime."
00:18:48,00:18:53,"So, it's got like financial fraud, maybe they can do that."
00:18:53,00:18:57,"So, for fighting riots, for burglaries, bank robberies, hostage situations, terrorist attacks."
00:18:57,00:19:01,"So, Hang on, is this the most terrifying place to accidentally get lost in one year or two?"
00:19:01,00:19:05,"Well, it's the most of the time, but then it'll suddenly be populated by about 300 members"
00:19:05,00:19:06,of the Met Police.
00:19:06,00:19:07,Wow.
00:19:07,00:19:08,Wow.
00:19:08,00:19:09,"They must have some stuff there, right?"
00:19:09,00:19:11,Because people are working there all the time.
00:19:11,00:19:16,"So, they must have like a microwave and they're probably a TV and some, you know, safes"
00:19:16,00:19:17,and stuff like that.
00:19:17,00:19:18,Yeah.
00:19:18,00:19:20,They're sick of all that stuff.
00:19:20,00:19:23,"And then when they arrest you, say, ""Oh, no, no, I'm part of the team, I'm part of the team."""
00:19:23,00:19:26,"I assume the response would be incredible, because you're literally in their training ground."
00:19:26,00:19:30,"And you've got like 400 policemen, you really eager to press their senior officers and prove"
00:19:30,00:19:31,themselves.
00:19:31,00:19:35,"Actually, I've never really felt like committing crimes, but I do kind of feel like going"
00:19:35,00:19:37,there and trying to steal something.
00:19:37,00:19:41,"And apparently, the one thing you want to steal is a microwave, setting your sights high,"
00:19:41,00:19:42,aren't you?
00:19:42,00:19:49,"Lock up your microwave, it's crazy."
00:19:49,00:19:53,"Pocos and James Harkin were tazered 80 times today and honestly, a single microwave."
00:19:53,00:20:00,He was about clutching a microwave and a steak bake.
00:20:00,00:20:08,"Okay, it's time for fact number three and that is my fact."
00:20:08,00:20:11,My fact is that ants have self-control.
00:20:11,00:20:19,So ants are able to defer gratification and put in more effort to get a bigger treat later
00:20:19,00:20:22,on than a smaller treat now.
00:20:22,00:20:27,"You offer it one small dollop of sugar, let's say 60 centimeters from its nest and then"
00:20:27,00:20:33,"you put a bigger dollop of sugar 120 centimeters away and then you show the ant, the one that's"
00:20:33,00:20:37,"120 centimeters away, it will walk out of its nest and ignore the smaller dollop and go"
00:20:37,00:20:40,the further distance to get the big one.
00:20:40,00:20:42,Why doesn't it get both?
00:20:42,00:20:44,"Well, I don't know."
00:20:44,00:20:49,I think maybe they stop it from going back for the smaller one later on and they explain
00:20:49,00:20:51,that to it before it starts.
00:20:51,00:20:52,I think so.
00:20:52,00:20:54,"You better choose now, Mr. Ant."
00:20:54,00:20:59,"They show it to the larger part, they give a little tour of the environment before it starts."
00:20:59,00:21:03,But twice as many ants deferred gratification and went to the bigger one than didn't.
00:21:03,00:21:06,And they tested it later on to make sure the ants weren't just picking something they
00:21:06,00:21:07,already knew about.
00:21:07,00:21:12,And they made the rewards of the same size in the experiment and in that case 83% chose
00:21:12,00:21:16,"the one that was actually closer, so given equal amounts of food, they'll pick the closer"
00:21:16,00:21:17,one.
00:21:17,00:21:18,"But anyway, I think it's a pretty amazing fact."
00:21:18,00:21:19,"It's really cool, yeah."
00:21:19,00:21:20,It's incredible.
00:21:20,00:21:25,Because they did a similar thing with Ravens who can understand the explaining stage.
00:21:25,00:21:26,Can't they?
00:21:26,00:21:29,They really can't understand English.
00:21:29,00:21:32,"According to science, Ravens are so clever, they can understand anything."
00:21:32,00:21:35,"I think they all understand the explaining stage, that's why the experiment yields the"
00:21:35,00:21:36,results it does.
00:21:36,00:21:37,"Yes, yeah, they do."
00:21:37,00:21:41,They may not understand the briefing document.
00:21:41,00:21:47,"But yeah, they obviously train them to know that they won't get the small bit of food if"
00:21:47,00:21:48,they go and eat the bigger bit of food.
00:21:48,00:21:53,"And when they did it to Ravens, they gave Ravens a treat that was inside a box, so they'd"
00:21:53,00:21:55,show them putting the treat inside a box.
00:21:55,00:21:58,"And it's a puzzle box, you know, like one of those Japanese puzzle boxes."
00:21:58,00:22:02,And then the Ravens worked out how to open the box using a specific tool that they used
00:22:02,00:22:07,"to open it, and then the scientists offered them either a piece of food that had been smaller"
00:22:07,00:22:12,"than the piece of food that was inside the box, or the tool needed to open the box without"
00:22:12,00:22:14,showing them the box.
00:22:14,00:22:18,"And the Ravens, almost all of the time, chose the tool and went to open the box."
00:22:18,00:22:23,"With one caveat, so the study said that one Raven had to be excluded as it worked out ways"
00:22:23,00:22:27,"to open the puzzle box without the tool, modifying bits of bark instead, so they were able to"
00:22:27,00:22:28,get into it.
00:22:28,00:22:33,So this is like deal or no deal.
00:22:33,00:22:35,Deal over the box is gone a bit of sausage.
00:22:35,00:22:40,"But then that is kind of delayed gratification, isn't it, because if you know there's a possible"
00:22:40,00:22:42,big prize you might get in the future.
00:22:42,00:22:43,Yeah.
00:22:43,00:22:44,Have we tried deal or no deal with ants?
00:22:44,00:22:46,I don't think we have.
00:22:46,00:22:50,"Well, and I would watch a version of deal or no deal where every box had different bits"
00:22:50,00:22:52,of food in it.
00:22:52,00:22:56,"Would you have to eat the food at the end, though, on the show you'd have to, right?"
00:22:56,00:23:01,"It gets to the end, you have to eat whatever's in the box that you choose to open."
00:23:01,00:23:04,"And that might be something you're allergic to, but you have to eat it."
00:23:04,00:23:06,Their worst box is still 1p.
00:23:06,00:23:07,Oh yeah.
00:23:07,00:23:14,I was reading the study and apparently this self-control thing is supposed to be to do with
00:23:14,00:23:19,"the size of the brain of the animal, so the bigger the brain in relation to its body,"
00:23:19,00:23:21,the more self-control it has.
00:23:21,00:23:23,"And so I was like, okay, does that make sense?"
00:23:23,00:23:26,"So I went and looked at a list of, there's a really helpful Wikipedia list of brain to body"
00:23:26,00:23:29,ratios of all the creatures in the world.
00:23:29,00:23:33,"And it got like so, humans have about, like, your brain is about the 50th to the size of"
00:23:33,00:23:34,your body.
00:23:34,00:23:37,"And like cats and dogs, it's, they have even smaller sets, like, the brain is 100th to the size"
00:23:37,00:23:39,of the body.
00:23:39,00:23:43,"Ants, the brain is 1/7th of their body, which I just found insane."
00:23:43,00:23:45,I imagine if your brain was a whole 7th of your body.
00:23:45,00:23:47,"That's basically like your whole head, isn't it?"
00:23:47,00:23:49,"No, it's bigger than your head."
00:23:49,00:23:50,It's bigger than your head.
00:23:50,00:23:51,I think it's like your head and your arms.
00:23:51,00:23:56,"Well, the clever thing that ants do using their massive brains is they, when given the chance,"
00:23:56,00:24:01,will use sponges to soak up liquid food.
00:24:01,00:24:03,So this is really clever.
00:24:03,00:24:08,Scientists gave them a pot of honey that was kind of mixed up with some mortar that they
00:24:08,00:24:09,would find really delicious.
00:24:09,00:24:12,"And then they gave them some tools that they would find in nature, like twigs and pine"
00:24:12,00:24:13,needles and stuff like that.
00:24:13,00:24:17,"And then they gave them some different tools that they wouldn't find in nature, like paper"
00:24:17,00:24:18,and little bits of sponge.
00:24:18,00:24:27,And the ants very quickly learned that the best thing to do rather than take a twig and
00:24:27,00:24:30,go and dip it in the honey and take it back to its mates would pick the sponge because
00:24:30,00:24:34,it realised it was more absorbent and went and dipped that in the honey and then took
00:24:34,00:24:35,it back to its mates.
00:24:35,00:24:36,It's incredible.
00:24:36,00:24:37,"Yeah, it's so cool."
00:24:37,00:24:40,"And then the next experiment, they gave them the choice of three different types of"
00:24:40,00:24:41,kitchen towel.
00:24:41,00:24:42,And they always look for the one.
00:24:42,00:24:43,The flash ball.
00:24:43,00:24:47,Because they always know there's way more absorbent than the other lady around.
00:24:47,00:24:50,Have we talked about Sir John Lubbock and his 19th century ant experiments?
00:24:50,00:24:52,I believe not.
00:24:52,00:24:54,He wanted to test like ants' friendship.
00:24:54,00:25:00,"So he put some ants in little environments, which was sort of an ant hill and there was some"
00:25:00,00:25:03,"water nearby and some, you know, little other mounds of things."
00:25:03,00:25:05,"And firstly, chloroformed some of the ants."
00:25:05,00:25:09,"He sort of kidnapped the ants, some ants out of the nest, chloroformed them and then abandoned"
00:25:09,00:25:12,them a short way from the ants for the other ants to find them so they sort of found their
00:25:12,00:25:13,friends.
00:25:13,00:25:14,How do you chloroform an ant?
00:25:14,00:25:17,How do you get your arm around it from behind?
00:25:17,00:25:20,"Very, very tiny car."
00:25:20,00:25:25,Then he would observe what the ants did to either ants that were from their own colony or
00:25:25,00:25:26,ants from another colony.
00:25:26,00:25:30,"But then he realized that ants don't recover from a chloroform, so he tried the same thing"
00:25:30,00:25:32,"that he got, he got ants drunk, which he said was really difficult."
00:25:32,00:25:37,"He said, I tried the same experiment only instead of chloroform the ants, I made them intoxicated."
00:25:37,00:25:41,"It was rather more difficult experiment, no ant would voluntarily degrade herself by"
00:25:41,00:25:46,"getting drunk, it's not so easy in all cases to hit off the rex of this compulsory intoxication."
00:25:46,00:25:50,"So, you know, he got these ants drunk and what he found was that sober ants would try and"
00:25:50,00:25:56,"pick up and help the drunk ants, then the sober ants would take them back to the nest."
00:25:56,00:26:01,"Now, if the ant was from the same colony, it would kind of look off to presumably be inside,"
00:26:01,00:26:04,like it would have bucked it in a towel and they-
00:26:04,00:26:05,Holders antenna back.
00:26:05,00:26:06,But this is the creepy bit.
00:26:06,00:26:11,"This is the creepy bit, if it wasn't from the same colony, it would bring the sober ant,"
00:26:11,00:26:15,would bring the drunk at back out and just quietly throw it in the water and drown it.
00:26:15,00:26:16,Wow!
00:26:16,00:26:19,"Which is horrendous, but yeah, isn't that amazing?"
00:26:19,00:26:23,"I thought that, and for some reason, I thought that ants chewed each other's legs off when"
00:26:23,00:26:24,they got drunk.
00:26:24,00:26:25,Hmm.
00:26:25,00:26:26,I think that might be bees.
00:26:26,00:26:30,"Oh, you're right, drunk bees will have their legs chewed off by their friends."
00:26:30,00:26:31,Really?
00:26:31,00:26:32,Yeah.
00:26:32,00:26:35,"What to kind of stop them going out, like kind of when I take my mum's car keys away"
00:26:35,00:26:36,when she's drunk.
00:26:36,00:26:42,"I was like, ""Oh, it's fine, I can fly, I can fly, and I feel fine."""
00:26:42,00:26:46,It's for your own good.
00:26:46,00:26:48,You'll thank me in the morning.
00:26:48,00:26:53,So this thing about self-control is related to the really famous experiment of the marshmallow test.
00:26:53,00:26:54,Yes.
00:26:54,00:26:59,"She was done in the 1960s, across the years of the 1960s, lots of them by the same scientist,"
00:26:59,00:27:02,whose name was Walter Michelle.
00:27:02,00:27:07,"And he tested children, he said, ""You can have one marshmallow now, or I'll come back"
00:27:07,00:27:11,"in 15 minutes, and you can have a second marshmallow if you haven't eaten the first one, but if"
00:27:11,00:27:15,"you want to be the first one, just ring the bell, and I'll come back and you can eat it."""
00:27:15,00:27:19,Some kids just immediately ate the marshmallow without even ringing the bell.
00:27:19,00:27:20,Just one.
00:27:20,00:27:25,"Yeah, but basically he found that children who were able to defer gratification ended up"
00:27:25,00:27:29,"doing better in later life, they got in less trouble with the law, they were healthier,"
00:27:29,00:27:32,"they paid more, this kind of thing."
00:27:32,00:27:35,"What I would have done is when he left the room, I would have hollowed out the marshmallow"
00:27:35,00:27:36,and eaten the middle.
00:27:36,00:27:38,"So you get the matter in our marshmallow, but then you leave it on the table so it looks"
00:27:38,00:27:39,like you don't need it.
00:27:39,00:27:44,"You are like the child who took an Oreo apart, licked the cream from the inside, and then"
00:27:44,00:27:46,put the Oreo back together.
00:27:46,00:27:47,That's what happened in one of the experiments.
00:27:47,00:27:48,What happened to him?
00:27:48,00:27:52,He is our president of the United States.
00:27:52,00:27:55,"But actually kids are getting better at this, aren't they?"
00:27:55,00:27:59,"There's been some work done this year, or quite recently, which found that the"
00:27:59,00:28:06,"children are getting better by about six seconds per year, as in the average of how long people"
00:28:06,00:28:07,were waiting.
00:28:07,00:28:12,"And there was a guy who did this study was called John Protsko, and he asked a load of psychologists"
00:28:12,00:28:16,"what they thought, and a load of child behavioural experts, what they thought."
00:28:16,00:28:22,"And only 16% thought that children's self-control had improved since the experiments of the 60s,"
00:28:22,00:28:27,"and 52% was sure that children would have been much worse at it, but actually they're better."
00:28:27,00:28:28,Wow.
00:28:28,00:28:31,So it's not like now that everyone is just watching YouTube all the time.
00:28:31,00:28:34,So does this mean that the intervals between are we nearly there yet?
00:28:34,00:28:35,They're going to get six seconds longer every year?
00:28:35,00:28:36,The one?
00:28:36,00:28:39,"Yes, so we are more nearly there than we used to be."
00:28:39,00:28:44,Do you know who's also good at it?
00:28:44,00:28:48,This experiment is a Camerunian children.
00:28:48,00:28:52,"They found out, I think this was this year in the last couple of years, so they repeated"
00:28:52,00:28:56,"the marshmallow experiment with three to five year olds from Germany, and then three"
00:28:56,00:29:00,to five year olds from Camerun from the Nusso tribe.
00:29:00,00:29:06,And they found that while 30% of the German kids managed to wait long enough to get the second
00:29:06,00:29:10,"treat, 70% of the Camerunian kids did, and they're not entirely sure why they think it might"
00:29:10,00:29:15,"be because from this particular group of people have strict appearance, and so it makes them"
00:29:15,00:29:18,used to being patient and waiting for staff.
00:29:18,00:29:21,"But yeah, they're really good at it."
00:29:21,00:29:24,"In that experiment, 10% of the Camerunian children just fell asleep waiting."
00:29:24,00:29:25,Yeah.
00:29:25,00:29:28,"They didn't have to, they didn't fall over the tall."
00:29:28,00:29:30,And there's another theory about why it might be.
00:29:30,00:29:34,"Maybe you're right, it may be that they've got strict appearance, and they're just told"
00:29:34,00:29:36,to be quiet and be patient more.
00:29:36,00:29:39,"But also, there's a thing about how much you trust that you're going to get the second"
00:29:39,00:29:40,marshmallow at the end.
00:29:40,00:29:43,"Yeah, I was thinking that actually, when you first had the experiment, there were a few"
00:29:43,00:29:44,things like that.
00:29:44,00:29:48,"For instance, one, you might not be that hungry, you might think, you know why I only really"
00:29:48,00:29:52,"want one marshmallow and two would be a bit much, so I'm just going to have this one."
00:29:52,00:29:55,A good scientist would starve the children beforehand.
00:29:55,00:29:58,"Well, what do you mean by good in this room?"
00:29:58,00:30:02,"Yeah, well, you might not like marshmallows on a body at all, so you might wait not because"
00:30:02,00:30:03,you've got self control.
00:30:03,00:30:05,"Hey, can I give you something more about ants?"
00:30:05,00:30:06,Yeah.
00:30:06,00:30:11,"So scientists have started putting barcodes on ants in order to monitor their behaviour,"
00:30:11,00:30:14,and they just look really cool.
00:30:14,00:30:18,"So this was said in passing in an experiment as to how ants respond to loneliness, which"
00:30:18,00:30:21,"is a bit sad actually, they don't like it at all."
00:30:21,00:30:25,So scientists plucked a few ants out of their colonies and they put them on their own and they
00:30:25,00:30:29,"fed them and everything, but they still died 10 times sooner than they would have otherwise."
00:30:29,00:30:31,"10 times sooner, that's terrible."
00:30:31,00:30:34,"They hit me on their own, because they don't live for long anyway, do they?"
00:30:34,00:30:35,They don't.
00:30:35,00:30:36,"I don't suppose they do, actually."
00:30:36,00:30:37,I don't really know.
00:30:37,00:30:41,"Some ants queen ants can live to 20 years, which was quite amazing."
00:30:41,00:30:42,That's incredible.
00:30:42,00:30:43,"That's true, rubbish."
00:30:43,00:30:46,Queen ants are the only ants who can legally drink the alcohol in this experiment of
00:30:46,00:30:52,"ounces. Anyway, to monitor ants, then scientists have started putting these tiny barcode backpacks"
00:30:52,00:30:58,"on them, and they glue them on, and this means they can just monitor all of their behaviour."
00:30:58,00:31:01,"So now we can really get detailed impressions of ant movement and everything, because we've"
00:31:01,00:31:06,"got computers locked onto every barcode, but we're only going to learn about ants that carry"
00:31:06,00:31:07,backpacks around.
00:31:07,00:31:10,Do you think their behaviour might change when you put a backpack on them?
00:31:10,00:31:14,"Yeah, they'll probably think they're on that gap here."
00:31:14,00:31:19,They'll probably just go cleaning their chakras and whatever.
00:31:19,00:31:23,We've learned that ants really find themselves.
00:31:23,00:31:28,"There's an ant expert called Clint Penic, who says he can identify different ants by their"
00:31:28,00:31:30,"ferrimones, just by smelling them."
00:31:30,00:31:31,He's lying.
00:31:31,00:31:33,"Well, he did it successfully for his mate."
00:31:33,00:31:37,"He had an ant infestation, and he went and sniffed them, and those ants were the ones that"
00:31:37,00:31:38,smelled like blue cheese.
00:31:38,00:31:39,"Well, what does he do?"
00:31:39,00:31:43,"He says, ""Oh, that one's Derek, and that one's Arthur, and that one's..."""
00:31:43,00:31:47,"He doesn't know all the individual ants by name, but he does know different types of ants,"
00:31:47,00:31:51,"and he says, ""Some smell like chocolate, but you have to crush their heads in order to smell"
00:31:51,00:31:53,"it, so that's a bit of a shame."""
00:31:53,00:31:54,Oh.
00:31:54,00:31:59,"Hello, I've brought my new pet ant, I wonder if you can tell me which kind of this place."
00:31:59,00:32:00,"Yes, of course."
00:32:00,00:32:01,Crush.
00:32:01,00:32:15,"I'm afraid your ant was not one of the one-two's heads, but I was like, ""Shorten up, I'm"
00:32:15,00:32:16,"in front of the head."""
00:32:16,00:32:17,"Okay, it's time for a final fact, and that is Alex."
00:32:17,00:32:19,My fact this week is that when filming the famous hill scene at the beginning of The Sound
00:32:19,00:32:23,"of Music, the helicopter down-draft would knock Julie Andrews over after each take."
00:32:23,00:32:27,I really want to see this be-roll.
00:32:27,00:32:28,That's incredible.
00:32:28,00:32:29,"And she said this herself, right?"
00:32:29,00:32:34,"Yeah, in some interview, in a sort of behind-the-scenes documentary, or I think it was actually"
00:32:34,00:32:38,"a documentary by Sue Perkins, that she made about The Sound of Music and a town where it"
00:32:38,00:32:43,"was filmed, because it's filmed in a town in Austria, and it was not a big film there."
00:32:43,00:32:46,"And most of the people who live there, they know it exists, but they've never seen it, and"
00:32:46,00:32:50,"they're kind of a bit baffled by why Taurus, so many Taurus from the YouTube."
00:32:50,00:32:51,It's actually in Germany as well.
00:32:51,00:32:52,It's in Germany.
00:32:52,00:32:55,"The hill scene is filmed in Germany, which I think is a cruel irony given the plotline"
00:32:55,00:32:56,of the film.
00:32:56,00:33:01,"Well, the other cruel irony is that they only had enough budget for one day of helicopter shooting,"
00:33:01,00:33:05,so they hired the helicopter for one day.
00:33:05,00:33:08,They filmed the very first scene of the movie with Julie Andrews spinning around on the
00:33:08,00:33:13,"hill a few times, then the helicopter immediately flew off over the mountains to film the very"
00:33:13,00:33:14,end of the film.
00:33:14,00:33:17,"The last scene, which is the Von Trapp family walking over the mountain."
00:33:17,00:33:18,That's wireless.
00:33:18,00:33:19,"Yes, wireless."
00:33:19,00:33:24,"Which is someone in the film walking over the mountains, but the story is based on a real"
00:33:24,00:33:25,life family.
00:33:25,00:33:29,"In real life, they escape whatever was they running from by train."
00:33:29,00:33:30,They escape the Nazi.
00:33:30,00:33:32,"I'm sorry, if you want to see the sound of music."
00:33:32,00:33:35,"I actually haven't seen the sound of the movie, but it's much of a spoiler."
00:33:35,00:33:38,"I mean, I did know that the Nazis didn't win the war."
00:33:38,00:33:39,So they escape.
00:33:39,00:33:40,They escape.
00:33:40,00:33:45,They might have won this battle.
00:33:45,00:33:49,"In real life, the Von Trapp family escaped the Nazis via train, but in the film, they had"
00:33:49,00:33:53,"them escaping by foot over the mountains, and they filmed them going over the mountains"
00:33:53,00:33:56,straight in the direction of Hitler's private chalet.
00:33:56,00:34:00,"So they would have bumped into Hitler, if he carried on watching the film after the credits."
00:34:00,00:34:05,"The post-credit scene is when they reveal a bit of the Marvel films, was it the Eagles"
00:34:05,00:34:06,Nest?
00:34:06,00:34:07,Yes.
00:34:07,00:34:08,Yes.
00:34:08,00:34:09,Was the name of the private.
00:34:09,00:34:16,"The Eagles Nest would be a great sound of music too, even to the Eagles Nest."
00:34:16,00:34:18,So she fell over.
00:34:18,00:34:22,"Because I was watching a Missbusters, because they were testing exactly the strength of"
00:34:22,00:34:26,"a helicopter down draft, and they made this model head, and then they made a helicopter hover"
00:34:26,00:34:31,"above it, and they tested the force that was coming down on it, and it's very small."
00:34:31,00:34:36,"So I was like 50 grams of force, and then it went up to about 100 grams as it accelerated"
00:34:36,00:34:37,upwards.
00:34:37,00:34:40,It's pretty windy if you go near a helicopter.
00:34:40,00:34:41,It's windy.
00:34:41,00:34:45,"And it came down very, it came down dangerously low, because it was pretty health and safety,"
00:34:45,00:34:48,"and there was one point at which Gideon was like, ""I thought I was going to lose my head."""
00:34:48,00:34:50,I just think she maybe was a bit weak.
00:34:50,00:34:53,"She probably was very slight, and she was a movie star."
00:34:53,00:34:54,She were in a big dress.
00:34:54,00:34:55,She was.
00:34:55,00:34:56,"Big, flowy dress."
00:34:56,00:35:00,"And she was on a quiet, steep mountain, and it was probably already windy, I'm sure."
00:35:00,00:35:04,"But apparently they did 10 takes of this, and she started screaming, ""Okay, that's enough."
00:35:04,00:35:05,"I've had enough now."""
00:35:05,00:35:09,"But the helicopter pilot couldn't hear her, so he took it to mean, ""Yep, let's go around"
00:35:09,00:35:10,"for another take."""
00:35:10,00:35:11,So he just kept going.
00:35:11,00:35:12,Wow.
00:35:12,00:35:15,"It's weird that, because yeah, she said the helicopter pilot thought I was just saying,"
00:35:15,00:35:16,"""Yeah, fine."
00:35:16,00:35:17,"Keep going."""
00:35:17,00:35:19,"But you would have thought as the helicopter pilot, if you've watched yourself knock"
00:35:19,00:35:24,"this woman flat on her face five times, you'd assume she was complaining about it by that"
00:35:24,00:35:25,point.
00:35:25,00:35:26,Yeah.
00:35:26,00:35:27,I think the downwash is quite strong.
00:35:27,00:35:30,"Yeah, maybe Mythbusters didn't crack the formula for a strong downdrop."
00:35:30,00:35:33,"I guess it depends on the helicopter, definitely."
00:35:33,00:35:35,And it depends on a load of other things.
00:35:35,00:35:39,But there is amazing footage online of a helicopter taking off.
00:35:39,00:35:43,"And as it goes, it just knocks over an entire row of porta-loos and it sends them all over"
00:35:43,00:35:45,the place.
00:35:45,00:35:48,And there are huge ribbons of blue paper flying off into the sky.
00:35:48,00:35:49,It's brilliant.
00:35:49,00:35:50,"Oh, wow."
00:35:50,00:35:51,Yeah.
00:35:51,00:35:56,There was a guy in Manchester who was playing golf this year and his ball was on the side of
00:35:56,00:36:02,the green and a helicopter went past and blew his golf ball into the hole.
00:36:02,00:36:03,Does that count?
00:36:03,00:36:08,"It doesn't know, but his mates didn't know that at the time, but they suspected it."
00:36:08,00:36:13,He said that they didn't pay up the 50 pH they would have owed him for getting a burning.
00:36:13,00:36:16,He said they accused me of colluding with a pilot.
00:36:16,00:36:20,I'm now known as Chopper Henderson.
00:36:20,00:36:26,"Just on golf courses and helicopters, there was a really good cracked article that was written"
00:36:26,00:36:31,by a helicopter pilot who was talking about the ridiculous task he's been given as one.
00:36:31,00:36:35,And he was once hired by some people who wanted to play golf to fly his helicopter across
00:36:35,00:36:39,of about two grand an hour over the golf course to dry the greens because it had rained
00:36:39,00:36:41,the night before.
00:36:41,00:36:42,Yeah.
00:36:42,00:36:45,He used that method to dry their crops.
00:36:45,00:36:51,"So for example, cherry farmers fly a helicopter really low because cherries get a lot of moisture"
00:36:51,00:36:52,on the outside right?
00:36:52,00:36:53,Yeah.
00:36:53,00:36:54,Or you can just blow the water off.
00:36:54,00:36:55,Yeah.
00:36:55,00:36:58,"But if it soaks in, then the cherries will split after a certain point they can't absorb"
00:36:58,00:36:59,that much water.
00:36:59,00:37:02,"And then if it's split, there's a much higher chance it'll rot."
00:37:02,00:37:05,"So you just get a chopper to fly over a few times, dry cherries."
00:37:05,00:37:06,Yeah.
00:37:06,00:37:14,As a hotel in Sussex made of a converted helicopter and it's called the holy copter.
00:37:14,00:37:15,Because of holiday.
00:37:15,00:37:16,Yeah.
00:37:16,00:37:21,I thought because it had holly the plant on it or it's like hollywood or...
00:37:21,00:37:22,No.
00:37:22,00:37:23,It's funny when you see it written down.
00:37:23,00:37:25,Although it's still pretty funny when you say that loud.
00:37:25,00:37:26,I love it.
00:37:26,00:37:27,I think it's great.
00:37:27,00:37:29,Drawing as a person called holy copter somewhere.
00:37:29,00:37:30,Probably.
00:37:30,00:37:31,No.
00:37:31,00:37:32,Yes.
00:37:32,00:37:33,No.
00:37:33,00:37:34,Just counts on it.
00:37:34,00:37:36,Must be somewhere.
00:37:36,00:37:38,Copter sounds like a medieval job.
00:37:38,00:37:41,"Well, the thing is copter in helicopter is not the suffix."
00:37:41,00:37:43,The suffix is pter.
00:37:43,00:37:45,It's my favourite etymology of all time.
00:37:45,00:37:46,Always has been.
00:37:46,00:37:47,Yeah.
00:37:47,00:37:48,"It's helico, pter."
00:37:48,00:37:49,I should tell you what that is.
00:37:49,00:37:50,I should tell you what that is.
00:37:50,00:37:51,I should tell you what that is.
00:37:51,00:37:52,I should tell you what that is.
00:37:52,00:37:53,That's what I call it.
00:37:53,00:37:55,"Because pter is like a pterodactyl, which means..."
00:37:55,00:37:57,"Pterodactyl is wing, wing."
00:37:57,00:37:58,Yeah.
00:37:58,00:38:01,"And helico, helix, so what the blade's been around, yeah."
00:38:01,00:38:02,Yeah.
00:38:02,00:38:07,"What do you know when the helicopter, the first functioning helicopter, was invented and flown?"
00:38:07,00:38:11,"Um, 1920."
00:38:11,00:38:12,Nice.
00:38:12,00:38:13,1784.
00:38:13,00:38:14,Wow.
00:38:14,00:38:15,What?
00:38:15,00:38:16,I got the teen bit.
00:38:16,00:38:18,You did very well.
00:38:18,00:38:23,"So in 1784, though, these two French inventors called Lornoi and Bianvenu."
00:38:23,00:38:24,And they...
00:38:24,00:38:30,"I mean, that's me trying to write a French character and can't think very well."
00:38:30,00:38:35,And he's called Bianvenu Panzelon.
00:38:35,00:38:36,It was his real name.
00:38:36,00:38:42,"He was a very welcoming man, and he made a toy helicopter, but it had a rotary wing and the..."
00:38:42,00:38:47,"Because they didn't have motors at that point, the power was provided by a spring mechanism,"
00:38:47,00:38:52,"and they made it fly up in the air, and it was only a year after the first successful balloon flight,"
00:38:52,00:38:55,which feels like a big step in the right direction.
00:38:55,00:38:57,So that was the first helicopter.
00:38:57,00:38:58,Wow.
00:38:58,00:39:04,"I think you talked about on QI this year, or going in the coming series, how the BBC plan"
00:39:04,00:39:10,for the Cold War was to broadcast the sound of music on repeat in the event of a nuclear strike.
00:39:10,00:39:11,Really?
00:39:11,00:39:14,"You know, because everything else would be pretty awful."
00:39:14,00:39:18,"Oh, and what we wouldn't find at awful having the sound of music on repeat for all of you to not see."
00:39:18,00:39:20,This good news is me and Andy haven't seen it.
00:39:20,00:39:21,Yeah.
00:39:21,00:39:25,"You're going to feel really guilty about that spoiler, Alex."
00:39:25,00:39:32,"Okay, that's it."
00:39:32,00:39:33,That's all of our facts.
00:39:33,00:39:35,Thank you very much indeed for listening.
