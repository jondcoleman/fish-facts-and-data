 Hello, and welcome to another episode of Most of Things A Fish, a weekly podcast coming

3
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,040
 to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

4
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26,040
 My name is Andrew Hunter Murray, and I am sitting here with James Harkin, Anna Tajinski,

5
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:31,120
 and Alex Bell, and once again we have gathered around these microphones to tell you our

6
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,320
 four favourite facts from the last seven days.

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,040
 So, in no particular order, here we go, starting with fact number one, and this week that

8
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,040
 is James.

9
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:47,240
 Okay, my fact this week is that when a prince in the Byzantine Empire was ready to marry,

10
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:52,240
 caught officials would walk around the land with an imperial shoe that they used to check

11
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,760
 the foot size of potential princesses.

12
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,760
 That is amazing.

13
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,760
 It's amazing.

14
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,240
 I mean, I can't really believe that.

15
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,440
 No, it sounds very much like a fairy tale.

16
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,440
 Yeah, it does.

17
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,960
 It's just my wife or something.

18
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:05,960
 Yeah.

19
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,960
 I jack up the Beanstalk.

20
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,960
 Yeah.

21
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,120
 So, does everyone do you think know what the Byzantine Empire was?

22
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,560
 I did not until I started researching this fact.

23
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,920
 So it is otherwise known as the Eastern Roman Empire, and the Roman Empire kind of split

24
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,320
 into two towards the end, and they had the Western side and the Eastern side.

25
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,120
 So this was around Turkey and around the Balkans, as they are today.

26
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,120
 Yes.

27
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,640
 In fact, they never called themselves Byzantins, did they?

28
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,640
 Or Byzantines.

29
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,520
 They always called themselves Romans.

30
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,480
 So apparently what would happen is when the prince wanted to marry, caught officials would

31
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:43,720
 go around not just with this shoe, but also with a painting of a perfect or ideal match

32
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,440
 that they should look like, and they try and find the perfect woman for him.

33
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,120
 This is like a manual tinder, then.

34
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,240
 I suppose so, but what if you're a terrible artist, for instance, and you're not very

35
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,240
 good at faces?

36
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,880
 So you have the same problem with tinder.

37
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,360
 You've got people with the Instagram filters that completely distort, you know, it's so nice

38
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,360
 having a young person here.

39
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,360
 It's my choice.

40
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,560
 I'm the only single person on the table on that, yeah.

41
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,560
 And I read this in the OUP blog, so it's Oxford University Press blog, and there's a whole

42
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,600
 thing about amazing facts about Byzantine Empire.

43
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,600
 It is.

44
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,600
 I'd never heard of this.

45
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,320
 There were wife shows, weren't they?

46
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,200
 And they would, you know, put these women on display.

47
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,120
 So it sounds like they would choose sometimes a, sort of, a lineup of women, so the mother

48
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,800
 of the prince would dispatch, you know, some emissaries to go around the empire, measuring

49
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,160
 up these women, and then pick the favourite 13, and then bring them back.

50
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,120
 And then there'd be sort of a bride show where they'd all, you know, they'd all be brought

51
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,960
 to podium, and then they could press their buttons to take themselves out of the game.

52
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,960
 Exactly.

53
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,200
 I'm trying a very labored way to describe the show, take me out, which I've never seen.

54
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,760
 And I, obviously, am flailing.

55
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,040
 I'd say it's more like an episode of the Bachelor, so the Emperor Theophilus had the Golden Apple,

56
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,520
 which he would then give to the winning bride.

57
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,440
 It's, I mean, it's literally the Bachelor.

58
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,200
 We're talking about shows that I've never heard of.

59
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,000
 How similar was it to blind date?

60
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Quite similar.

61
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Is it?

62
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,720
 Yeah, except the man behind the screen has the power to kill you if he doesn't like you.

63
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,720
 Okay.

64
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,680
 There's another thing about Byzantine wife finding for royalty.

65
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,520
 This is from a book called A Cabinet of Byzantine Curiosities.

66
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:21,120
 And the finalists who were the potential brides selected for the Emperor, they were sometimes

67
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,240
 examined, nude in the bath, by the prince's mum.

68
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,000
 Ah, so that's a bit like that.

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,480
 Another show where, what's it called, where everyone's naked, and you...

70
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,480
 Oh, naked attraction.

71
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,480
 Yeah.

72
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,480
 Yes.

73
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,480
 It is like that.

74
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,800
 All Channel 4 formats are taken from the Byzantine Empire.

75
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,000
 I think that was Theophano, wasn't it?

76
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,080
 I think it was just one mother who was particularly keen on getting the right woman who...

77
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,080
 Embarrassed.

78
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,080
 I know.

79
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,400
 She put the final three in the bath, and then she draped a golden robe around the one whose

80
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,880
 body presumably she thought was the most beautiful.

81
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,880
 Wait a minute.

82
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,600
 Wasn't there another show where someone went on a date, and their parents were watching

83
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,880
 the date, and they got to choose who had the date?

84
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,880
 I think that...

85
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,840
 I think there's a BBC 3 format based on that.

86
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,840
 Yeah.

87
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,840
 That's called Sun Sex and Suspicious Parents.

88
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,840
 No, that's a slightly different one.

89
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,160
 I don't care if I didn't watch these.

90
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,160
 I just work in television.

91
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:14,040
 That's the one where the parents go on holiday, secretly observe their children.

92
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,720
 They're being raucous abroad, and then they confront them at the end.

93
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,320
 I don't know if we'll be talking about a great historic civilization and empire in this

94
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,320
 podcast.

95
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,320
 We are Channel 4.

96
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:30,000
 But that would be so fitting, because it was always the mum, right?

97
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,440
 The son had no choice in it, it seemed like it was always the mother who'd go out and

98
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,440
 select the...

99
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,760
 She was very much the executive producer of these mountains.

100
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:43,040
 I looked into whether Byzantium was Byzantine, you know, whether the word Byzantine is...

101
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,920
 Because it's complicated by Byzantine, you know, that's what it means.

102
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,920
 And they...

103
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,120
 Was it an especially complicated place?

104
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,520
 It was quite complicated, but only compared with Western Europe at the time where you just

105
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,720
 had a load of feudal lords and things.

106
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,920
 And there were a load of behavioral codes about where you could sit at Royal Bankwits and

107
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,560
 what you could talk about and who you could talk to.

108
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,280
 But actually, compared with modern, for example, derivatives companies, then it's actually

109
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,280
 quite simple.

110
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,280
 So it's complicated.

111
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,720
 It's also the Facebook stages of most of the royal marriages given that...

112
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,240
 Yeah, my stepmother picked her out of the bar for me.

113
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,120
 I read that Byzantine in the way that we use it in common parlance has negative connotations,

114
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:25,040
 obviously, and that that was partly because the Empire was portrayed not only as complicated,

115
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,200
 but as quite secretive and lots of lascivious stuff was going on.

116
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:33,680
 And so one example of this was they were interquite a lot of sexual things that the West didn't

117
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,680
 appreciate.

118
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,160
 And one of these things was recorded by a historian who wrote a very famous book at the time

119
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:44,760
 called The Secret History, and it was about Emperor Justinian's wife, Theodora, who used

120
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:49,320
 to dance around naked in this huge atrium in front of lots of people in this theatre.

121
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,240
 And she'd just have a ribbon round her waist because it was actually legal to be fully naked,

122
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,240
 ribbon round her waist.

123
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,160
 And then she would lie on the ground and have slaves drop grain on her torso and other

124
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,720
 parts from above.

125
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,640
 And then she'd have a herd of geese fly in and peck the grain of her nude body.

126
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,640
 Wow.

127
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,320
 It would be a skeen of geese if it was flying in.

128
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,320
 Sorry.

129
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,320
 Oh, yeah.

130
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,320
 Thanks for that.

131
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,320
 I think landed and walked over.

132
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,320
 They'd become a gaggle of geese.

133
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,320
 They become a gaggle.

134
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,320
 Yeah.

135
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,720
 You were really in your focusing on the wrong aspects of the story, here you go.

136
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,640
 You were a massive kill during a strip club, aren't you?

137
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,320
 So the geese are pecking at her bits, are they?

138
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,320
 I believe so.

139
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,320
 Yeah.

140
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,000
 There's some question mark over how true this account is.

141
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,360
 I think this guy has sort of fallen out with her and Justinian at this point.

142
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,720
 You know when you go to St. James's Park and you want to feed the geese, and you throw

143
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,560
 bits of like bread there, not bread, because they don't like bread, but you throw stuff

144
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,560
 at them.

145
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,880
 And then always the pigeons come in and eat it, don't they?

146
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:49,480
 She reckons she was late, and the pigeons just can't live with that a bit since then.

147
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,200
 He doesn't recall that, but it can only have been the case.

148
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,560
 Is that sexy?

149
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,560
 Having pigeons.

150
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,160
 For anyone, no, even the geese, I would say.

151
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,160
 Geese are very aggressive.

152
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,600
 I would have thought it would be very unpleasant.

153
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,600
 I would.

154
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,600
 Just one would be bad.

155
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,600
 Yeah.

156
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,600
 Oh my God.

157
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,600
 I don't think.

158
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,280
 I'm not sure if I'll do it down there.

159
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,800
 Here's the thing about Byzantine Empire.

160
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,920
 It was around the same time as the Norman Conquest, it was happening.

161
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:22,960
 And when the Norman Conquest happened, a load of Anglo-Saxons from Britain became refugees

162
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,040
 and left Britain.

163
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,320
 And they traveled down into Europe.

164
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:32,720
 And they got to the Byzantine Empire where they kind of became citizens.

165
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,600
 And they lived around the Black Sea around Crimea, which it is today, and apparently they called

166
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,600
 it New England.

167
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,600
 Really?

168
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,320
 So that's where the first New England was, yeah.

169
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,320
 That's so cool.

170
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,320
 That is amazing.

171
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,320
 It's interesting, isn't it?

172
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:51,400
 Imagining basically the British becoming refugees and kind of going down to living Crimea

173
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,400
 given all the modern day.

174
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,400
 Yeah.

175
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,400
 Things happen.

176
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,400
 Yeah.

177
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,760
 Wow, and it would have been a much more progressive place then than old Anglo-Saxon just

178
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,520
 conquered England, which was a nightmare.

179
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,520
 I've got a couple of facts about matchmaking.

180
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,520
 Yeah.

181
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:09,800
 So in 1924, there was a magazine called Science and Invention, and it said that to match a couple

182
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:15,360
 up properly, one test that you should conduct was firing a gun in the air behind them

183
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,080
 when neither of them knew about it.

184
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,840
 And it's to test whether they're calm under pressure, because apparently in every couple

185
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,840
 you want someone who can remain calm under pressure.

186
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,760
 And if they both react nervously, then they shouldn't get married.

187
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,760
 That's interesting.

188
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:34,560
 I thought it would be that they were like, oh, we're all going to die, and then they kind

189
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,600
 of jump into each other's arms kind of thing.

190
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,240
 Yeah, to see who jumps in front of them, like in friends when Joey jumps in front of a sandwich

191
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,240
 when a car backfires.

192
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,240
 Yes.

193
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,240
 Yes.

194
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,960
 I would have thought it's quite good survival instinct to try and jump out of the way if you

195
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,120
 hear a gun being fired, though.

196
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,440
 And I would say you don't want two people in a couple who just stand there and let the

197
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,440
 bullet penetrate their bodies.

198
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,440
 That is true.

199
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,440
 Sorry.

200
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,160
 It's how they react to an extreme loud noise really close by.

201
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:01,240
 It's not, you don't have to fire a gun, ask anyone for this demonstration to work.

202
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,240
 How have he died in this experiment?

203
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,280
 This would be another great channel for full management.

204
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:13,360
 I have one fact about Cinderella's glass slippers, which was that in 2015, a scientific study

205
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,320
 was published in the Journal of Physics Special Topics, which worked out how practical the

206
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,480
 slippers would have been.

207
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:25,360
 And it based on a weight of 55 kilograms of Cinderella and a size full foot, she only

208
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,920
 would have been able to wear the slippers if she stood completely still, because if she

209
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,560
 tried to run away from the prints in them, they would have immediately shattered.

210
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,680
 But that's why they fell off when she ran away, and that's why, like, it wasn't worth it.

211
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,680
 Oh, right.

212
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,680
 They thought of that in the story.

213
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,880
 But actually, she wouldn't have been able to walk anyway, she would have to stand exactly

214
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,880
 still.

215
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,560
 The only way it would have worked is if they heels were 1.15 centimetres tall, which is

216
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,920
 not very high.

217
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,600
 There's an Italian version of Cinderella from the 19th century.

218
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,640
 Well, it's from earlier than that, but it was first recorded in a book about Cinderella

219
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,520
 stories from the 1890s.

220
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:01,720
 And that version has Cinderella being born inside a squash, like a button at squash.

221
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,320
 So her mother gives birth to her, but she thinks she's just given birth to a squash.

222
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,320
 And so she abandons her in the woods.

223
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,200
 And then the prints walks by, and by that time Cinderella inside the squash has learned

224
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,200
 to talk.

225
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,240
 So the prints walks past and says, oh, it's with, it's a talking pumpkin.

226
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,640
 And so then he takes it home with him.

227
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:24,240
 And I would argue this is a different story, like there's no detail so far that correlates.

228
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,040
 Well, there's the pumpkin thing.

229
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,200
 And then eventually she breaks out of the squash and acts as his servant, and then she goes

230
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:35,480
 to a ball he's holding dressed up as a princess, and he falls in love with her and they get married.

231
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,880
 And it's called, the story is called Zucatina, as in Zucchini.

232
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,880
 Oh, really?

233
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,880
 You know, related.

234
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,880
 What, presumably?

235
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,880
 Which one's Zucchini again?

236
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,880
 Cautier.

237
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,880
 Yeah.

238
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,880
 Also, is she in a courgette?

239
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,880
 No, it says she's in a button at squash.

240
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,880
 I guess they're all related, I say.

241
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,880
 Family, yeah.

242
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,880
 Same family.

243
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,880
 Some sort of legume.

244
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:02,800
 Okay, it's time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

245
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,480
 Yes, my fact this week is that China has built an exact replica of an Austrian village,

246
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,240
 so that tourists don't have to fly all the way to Austria.

247
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:17,200
 So this is the, based on the town of Halstadt in Austria, and I think it's the oldest village

248
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,560
 or the oldest town in Austria.

249
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,560
 It's really beautiful.

250
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,480
 It's your ideal, when you picture an Austrian village.

251
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,320
 It's kind of just really a delic.

252
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,320
 Okay.

253
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,320
 I'm just picturing that.

254
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,320
 Oh.

255
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,320
 Oh.

256
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,320
 It's nice, isn't it?

257
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,320
 Oh, sorry.

258
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,320
 I pictured a Swiss one instead.

259
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,320
 Oh, god.

260
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,320
 Mine's just sort of Chinese people.

261
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,320
 I can't remember.

262
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:42,040
 So this development was started in China in 2012 in Boluo County, which is sort of in

263
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:47,920
 the factory belt, and basically the bunch of Chinese architects were sent to the real town

264
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,160
 of Halstadt in Cognito, and they went round it, and they took lots of notes, and they did

265
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,000
 lots of sketches on what it looked like, or took some pictures like this.

266
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 Not in Cognito, is it?

267
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,480
 Like, don't steal our town.

268
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,720
 Like, why they could have just gone to visit them?

269
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,720
 No one's going to care.

270
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,600
 Well, they might raise suspicions, and then they went back to China, and they started

271
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,080
 copying it at a very high speed, and it was built within about a year.

272
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,840
 And the mayor of the original town found out about halfway through.

273
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,720
 And he said he was a bit annoyed at first.

274
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,800
 He said they should have told us, but he's actually really impressed with the town.

275
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,640
 He says it is exactly the same, and he went to the official welcoming ceremony there and

276
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,640
 everything.

277
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,640
 So happily ever after.

278
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,640
 That's good.

279
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,640
 Yeah.

280
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,640
 Another fairy tale.

281
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,640
 Yeah.

282
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,640
 Are they twins?

283
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,640
 That would be nice.

284
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,640
 They are twins, yes.

285
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,640
 Yes.

286
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,640
 Good.

287
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,640
 Why did they do this?

288
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,640
 Because tourists are traveling.

289
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,160
 Well, I suppose China is quite interested in Western culture, and so they have quite a lot

290
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,320
 of replicas of other Western buildings, or Western enclave.

291
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,320
 Whole other towns.

292
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,320
 They've got a replica of Paris.

293
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,320
 They've got replica of a Swedish town.

294
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,000
 But the idea is that people can live there as well.

295
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 You can move in.

296
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,520
 So there are lots of people living in this Austrian town.

297
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,520
 Yeah.

298
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,520
 And I think a lot of them aren't that successful.

299
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,520
 And there's a lot of people.

300
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,520
 There's a lot of people.

301
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,520
 Very nice.

302
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,520
 Well, I guess.

303
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:01,000
 But the one, the massive one of Paris that they built is basically a ghost town now,

304
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 because it didn't work out.

305
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,600
 There's often this pretty successful, I think, and people actually are living there.

306
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,400
 And it's like a big, gated community.

307
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,400
 Some people live there, yeah.

308
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,400
 So it's mainly touristy.

309
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,360
 But the Paris one, I thought, yeah, they didn't quite finish it.

310
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,840
 Although they did build a huge, rifle tower, which is the main bit.

311
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,800
 I just think if you're going to build a new town, like we do that in the UK sometimes, why

312
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,080
 not build it that looks like New Orleans or something?

313
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,080
 Why not?

314
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,080
 Yeah, it might as well.

315
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,080
 Yeah.

316
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,080
 They're tried and tested, aren't they?

317
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,080
 Yeah, exactly.

318
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,080
 Exactly.

319
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,080
 And it's worked for Haustadt.

320
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:32,240
 This is probably one of the reasons why the mayor is OK with it, because visitors to

321
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,520
 the real Haustadt since the town was built, have gone from 50 to 1,000 per year from

322
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,360
 China.

323
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,760
 And I seem to be the only one who's not completely cool with this wholesale town plagiarism

324
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,760
 that's going on.

325
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,760
 What?

326
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,760
 Why not?

327
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,200
 Because, you know, things should be where they are and nowhere else.

328
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,960
 They haven't removed the town from the streets.

329
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:53,320
 Do you think maybe we should knock down Blackpool Tower, because that was just a copy of

330
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,320
 the Eiffel Tower?

331
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,840
 Oh, well, James, I had not had that brought to my attention before, and yes, I do.

332
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:03,200
 I think future archaeologists are going to be extremely confused when they come across,

333
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,880
 you know, the real Paris and then the fake Paris, and they're going to say, well, this

334
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,280
 seems to be the main civilization, because all of the stuff was here, and then that's

335
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,280
 spread out around the world.

336
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:14,360
 I get worried about that, actually, because you know how now, obviously, we've fetishised

337
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,080
 antique stuff and historical stuff, and we build houses in old style, and we have antique

338
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,760
 furniture, and I worry about archaeologists, a couple of thousand years in the future about

339
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,760
 confusing them.

340
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,120
 You know, going, wait, I thought this house was from the 21st century, but there's a

341
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,600
 16th century chair in it, and they won't know what to do.

342
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,600
 Exactly.

343
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,600
 Anyway.

344
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,000
 But this is a kind of thing, which is not unique to Chinese culture, but it is more prevalent

345
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 there.

346
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,200
 So there was a study which found that of the articles submitted to the science journal

347
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:47,160
 at Shiejiang University, 30% of them were plagiarised either partly or wholly, and that's

348
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,560
 quite a high proportion.

349
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,560
 Yeah.

350
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,720
 And very few people theorised that it's about the way you learn Chinese characters, you have

351
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,720
 to learn through copying a repetition, and it's seen completely differently there.

352
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,400
 It's not seen as plagiarism to the same extent.

353
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:04,000
 Yeah, I read that apparently lots of theorists think that it's, as you say, because of the Chinese

354
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,800
 characters, and it's because it's so difficult to learn so many, that there's not enough creative

355
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,800
 space left over in Chinese brains for creativity, which seems like the most absurd reason you've

356
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,800
 ever heard.

357
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,200
 First of all, they invented almost everything we had up until about the 16th century, didn't

358
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,200
 they?

359
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,200
 Yeah.

360
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,200
 And then we copied it.

361
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,200
 And then we copied it.

362
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,200
 Yeah.

363
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:29,040
 We should be allowed to use a wheelbarrow, because it was invented by the Chinese.

364
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,600
 Yeah, that's really awkward, because you're now claiming that as the landmark invention,

365
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,800
 which is sort of insulting to some of the other things they did invent.

366
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,800
 Do you know what?

367
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,400
 I think I could get by the rest of my life never using a wheelbarrow.

368
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,240
 This podcast has taken a distinctly brexity flavour.

369
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,120
 Yeah, I didn't mean to.

370
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,120
 But yeah, they do.

371
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,280
 And it's kind of a form of flattery in a way, isn't it?

372
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,680
 It's just that interest in designs over the rest of the world.

373
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,040
 I think it seems that imitation is the highest form of flattery.

374
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,560
 That's the difference between wearing similar clothes to someone, and then getting

375
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,840
 plastic surgery for your face looks exactly like them.

376
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,840
 It's...

377
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,840
 I'd be flattered.

378
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,840
 Feel free, Alex.

379
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,840
 But massively wasted out.

380
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,880
 Have you heard about the replica Noah's Ark?

381
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,880
 No.

382
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,880
 No.

383
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,160
 So this was built in America in, oh, when was it finished?

384
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:17,480
 It was finished a few years ago, but this decade, and lots of people keep building replica

385
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,480
 Noah's Arks.

386
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,480
 But this one is massive.

387
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:26,080
 It's in Kentucky, and it cost $120 million to build, it's built by this Bible group called

388
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,080
 Answers in Genesis.

389
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,720
 So I think they're an online church.

390
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,640
 It took 700 workers, as long as an American football field, it's massive.

391
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,640
 How long is that?

392
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,640
 100 yards.

393
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,640
 100 yards.

394
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,840
 And it was built by a man called Ken Ham.

395
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,800
 Ham was one of Noah's sites.

396
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,800
 Oh, yeah.

397
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,800
 Yeah.

398
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,800
 Also, the first chimpanzee in space.

399
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,680
 Yeah, I don't know which he was named after.

400
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,680
 If either.

401
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,880
 But they've got this massive plan, and no one knows what Noah's Ark looked like either,

402
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,800
 but they've insisted it's a replica.

403
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,280
 We have in the Bible, it says how big it is, doesn't it?

404
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,160
 It says the number of qubits by the number of qubits.

405
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,160
 Okay.

406
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,160
 But yeah.

407
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,960
 And Irving Finkel did that study, didn't he?

408
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,480
 So he's great at the British Museum, and he did that study that decided it was spherical.

409
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,680
 He thinks he's a coracle.

410
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,680
 Yeah.

411
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:15,240
 But his design is based on Babylonian tablets, so not on the Hebrew Bible.

412
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,240
 Yeah.

413
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,080
 For clearly he wants more massively reliable fare.

414
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,760
 He's working on another thing, Mr. Ham.

415
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,760
 Oh, yeah.

416
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:28,480
 He's working with his partners on a 10-year plan to build a biblical walled city in Kentucky,

417
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,840
 which is also going to feature a 10 plagues of Egypt ride.

418
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,840
 Wow.

419
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,840
 That sounds good.

420
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,960
 But then did they kill your first boss at the end of the year?

421
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,480
 That's the bit where the camera goes off.

422
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:47,520
 There's another boat, replica boat, in the news at the moment, actually, which is a replica

423
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,520
 of the boat that James Cook used to sail to Australia.

424
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,600
 So that's the endeavor, but that is moving to Whitby.

425
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,600
 So it's been in Stockton on Tees, and it's just been bought by someone for £110,000.

426
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:05,000
 And it's going to cost them £250,000 to move it 39 miles up the road.

427
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 I was going to say it's not far from Whitby to Stockton.

428
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 No, it's not.

429
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 It's certainly not written to Australia.

430
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,040
 But I think it's the land bit.

431
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,040
 There's the problem.

432
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,280
 I mean, if you could sail there.

433
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,440
 Oh, is it going over the land?

434
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,640
 It has to go over the land a bit, yeah.

435
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,640
 I think that has passed the difficulty.

436
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,960
 It's oddly expensive to move boats across the land for some reason.

437
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,640
 Well, they're not going to get to Australia like that.

438
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,000
 No, no, they will come across water at some point.

439
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,800
 Are they going to resale at Australia?

440
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,160
 No, he's just going to literally move it to Whitby and keep it as a tourist attraction there.

441
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,160
 All right.

442
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,760
 And I wonder if he was told after he'd made the initial purchase that it was going to cost

443
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,520
 all the £250,000 to move it for where it is.

444
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:44,040
 On other replica model villages that aren't quite real places, in Gravesend, there's a whole

445
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:48,480
 town that's fake, and it's used by police to simulate pretty much any manner of crime.

446
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,440
 So, it's got like financial fraud, maybe they can do that.

447
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,760
 So, for fighting riots, for burglaries, bank robberies, hostage situations, terrorist attacks.

448
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,360
 So, Hang on, is this the most terrifying place to accidentally get lost in one year or two?

449
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,040
 Well, it's the most of the time, but then it'll suddenly be populated by about 300 members

450
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,040
 of the Met Police.

451
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,040
 Wow.

452
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,040
 Wow.

453
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,960
 They must have some stuff there, right?

454
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,480
 Because people are working there all the time.

455
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:16,080
 So, they must have like a microwave and they're probably a TV and some, you know, safes

456
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,080
 and stuff like that.

457
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,080
 Yeah.

458
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,000
 They're sick of all that stuff.

459
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,480
 And then when they arrest you, say, "Oh, no, no, I'm part of the team, I'm part of the team."

460
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,640
 I assume the response would be incredible, because you're literally in their training ground.

461
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,560
 And you've got like 400 policemen, you really eager to press their senior officers and prove

462
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,560
 themselves.

463
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:35,080
 Actually, I've never really felt like committing crimes, but I do kind of feel like going

464
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,040
 there and trying to steal something.

465
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:41,320
 And apparently, the one thing you want to steal is a microwave, setting your sights high,

466
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,320
 aren't you?

467
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:49,040
 Lock up your microwave, it's crazy.

468
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:53,480
 Pocos and James Harkin were tazered 80 times today and honestly, a single microwave.

469
00:19:53,480 --> 00:20:00,680
 He was about clutching a microwave and a steak bake.

470
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:08,080
 Okay, it's time for fact number three and that is my fact.

471
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,400
 My fact is that ants have self-control.

472
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:19,280
 So ants are able to defer gratification and put in more effort to get a bigger treat later

473
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,480
 on than a smaller treat now.

474
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,880
 You offer it one small dollop of sugar, let's say 60 centimeters from its nest and then

475
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:33,120
 you put a bigger dollop of sugar 120 centimeters away and then you show the ant, the one that's

476
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,960
 120 centimeters away, it will walk out of its nest and ignore the smaller dollop and go

477
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,640
 the further distance to get the big one.

478
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,160
 Why doesn't it get both?

479
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,360
 Well, I don't know.

480
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:49,280
 I think maybe they stop it from going back for the smaller one later on and they explain

481
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,000
 that to it before it starts.

482
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 I think so.

483
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,560
 You better choose now, Mr. Ant.

484
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:59,040
 They show it to the larger part, they give a little tour of the environment before it starts.

485
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:03,560
 But twice as many ants deferred gratification and went to the bigger one than didn't.

486
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,640
 And they tested it later on to make sure the ants weren't just picking something they

487
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,640
 already knew about.

488
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:12,080
 And they made the rewards of the same size in the experiment and in that case 83% chose

489
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,000
 the one that was actually closer, so given equal amounts of food, they'll pick the closer

490
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 one.

491
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,480
 But anyway, I think it's a pretty amazing fact.

492
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,480
 It's really cool, yeah.

493
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,480
 It's incredible.

494
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,320
 Because they did a similar thing with Ravens who can understand the explaining stage.

495
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,320
 Can't they?

496
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,360
 They really can't understand English.

497
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,920
 According to science, Ravens are so clever, they can understand anything.

498
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,680
 I think they all understand the explaining stage, that's why the experiment yields the

499
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,680
 results it does.

500
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,680
 Yes, yeah, they do.

501
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,800
 They may not understand the briefing document.

502
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:47,160
 But yeah, they obviously train them to know that they won't get the small bit of food if

503
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,720
 they go and eat the bigger bit of food.

504
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,440
 And when they did it to Ravens, they gave Ravens a treat that was inside a box, so they'd

505
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,280
 show them putting the treat inside a box.

506
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,440
 And it's a puzzle box, you know, like one of those Japanese puzzle boxes.

507
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,240
 And then the Ravens worked out how to open the box using a specific tool that they used

508
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,600
 to open it, and then the scientists offered them either a piece of food that had been smaller

509
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,800
 than the piece of food that was inside the box, or the tool needed to open the box without

510
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,080
 showing them the box.

511
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,840
 And the Ravens, almost all of the time, chose the tool and went to open the box.

512
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:23,320
 With one caveat, so the study said that one Raven had to be excluded as it worked out ways

513
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:27,680
 to open the puzzle box without the tool, modifying bits of bark instead, so they were able to

514
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,680
 get into it.

515
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:33,400
 So this is like deal or no deal.

516
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,880
 Deal over the box is gone a bit of sausage.

517
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:40,320
 But then that is kind of delayed gratification, isn't it, because if you know there's a possible

518
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,240
 big prize you might get in the future.

519
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,240
 Yeah.

520
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,960
 Have we tried deal or no deal with ants?

521
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,480
 I don't think we have.

522
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,920
 Well, and I would watch a version of deal or no deal where every box had different bits

523
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,200
 of food in it.

524
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,160
 Would you have to eat the food at the end, though, on the show you'd have to, right?

525
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:01,160
 It gets to the end, you have to eat whatever's in the box that you choose to open.

526
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,680
 And that might be something you're allergic to, but you have to eat it.

527
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,920
 Their worst box is still 1p.

528
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,920
 Oh yeah.

529
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:14,240
 I was reading the study and apparently this self-control thing is supposed to be to do with

530
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,600
 the size of the brain of the animal, so the bigger the brain in relation to its body,

531
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,400
 the more self-control it has.

532
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,200
 And so I was like, okay, does that make sense?

533
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,960
 So I went and looked at a list of, there's a really helpful Wikipedia list of brain to body

534
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,200
 ratios of all the creatures in the world.

535
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,000
 And it got like so, humans have about, like, your brain is about the 50th to the size of

536
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 your body.

537
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,680
 And like cats and dogs, it's, they have even smaller sets, like, the brain is 100th to the size

538
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,000
 of the body.

539
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 Ants, the brain is 1/7th of their body, which I just found insane.

540
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,880
 I imagine if your brain was a whole 7th of your body.

541
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,560
 That's basically like your whole head, isn't it?

542
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,240
 No, it's bigger than your head.

543
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,240
 It's bigger than your head.

544
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,240
 I think it's like your head and your arms.

545
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:56,960
 Well, the clever thing that ants do using their massive brains is they, when given the chance,

546
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,200
 will use sponges to soak up liquid food.

547
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,200
 So this is really clever.

548
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,160
 Scientists gave them a pot of honey that was kind of mixed up with some mortar that they

549
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,560
 would find really delicious.

550
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,600
 And then they gave them some tools that they would find in nature, like twigs and pine

551
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,920
 needles and stuff like that.

552
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,080
 And then they gave them some different tools that they wouldn't find in nature, like paper

553
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,760
 and little bits of sponge.

554
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:27,000
 And the ants very quickly learned that the best thing to do rather than take a twig and

555
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,840
 go and dip it in the honey and take it back to its mates would pick the sponge because

556
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,960
 it realised it was more absorbent and went and dipped that in the honey and then took

557
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,960
 it back to its mates.

558
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,960
 It's incredible.

559
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,960
 Yeah, it's so cool.

560
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,600
 And then the next experiment, they gave them the choice of three different types of

561
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,600
 kitchen towel.

562
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,600
 And they always look for the one.

563
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,600
 The flash ball.

564
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,040
 Because they always know there's way more absorbent than the other lady around.

565
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:50,840
 Have we talked about Sir John Lubbock and his 19th century ant experiments?

566
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,160
 I believe not.

567
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,800
 He wanted to test like ants' friendship.

568
00:24:54,800 --> 00:25:00,240
 So he put some ants in little environments, which was sort of an ant hill and there was some

569
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,640
 water nearby and some, you know, little other mounds of things.

570
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,840
 And firstly, chloroformed some of the ants.

571
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,680
 He sort of kidnapped the ants, some ants out of the nest, chloroformed them and then abandoned

572
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,920
 them a short way from the ants for the other ants to find them so they sort of found their

573
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,920
 friends.

574
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,920
 How do you chloroform an ant?

575
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,560
 How do you get your arm around it from behind?

576
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,840
 Very, very tiny car.

577
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:25,440
 Then he would observe what the ants did to either ants that were from their own colony or

578
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,920
 ants from another colony.

579
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,040
 But then he realized that ants don't recover from a chloroform, so he tried the same thing

580
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,760
 that he got, he got ants drunk, which he said was really difficult.

581
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:37,440
 He said, I tried the same experiment only instead of chloroform the ants, I made them intoxicated.

582
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,240
 It was rather more difficult experiment, no ant would voluntarily degrade herself by

583
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:46,960
 getting drunk, it's not so easy in all cases to hit off the rex of this compulsory intoxication.

584
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,720
 So, you know, he got these ants drunk and what he found was that sober ants would try and

585
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:56,600
 pick up and help the drunk ants, then the sober ants would take them back to the nest.

586
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:01,800
 Now, if the ant was from the same colony, it would kind of look off to presumably be inside,

587
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,320
 like it would have bucked it in a towel and they-

588
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,320
 Holders antenna back.

589
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,960
 But this is the creepy bit.

590
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,120
 This is the creepy bit, if it wasn't from the same colony, it would bring the sober ant,

591
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,520
 would bring the drunk at back out and just quietly throw it in the water and drown it.

592
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,520
 Wow!

593
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,280
 Which is horrendous, but yeah, isn't that amazing?

594
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:23,000
 I thought that, and for some reason, I thought that ants chewed each other's legs off when

595
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 they got drunk.

596
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 Hmm.

597
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 I think that might be bees.

598
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,880
 Oh, you're right, drunk bees will have their legs chewed off by their friends.

599
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,880
 Really?

600
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,880
 Yeah.

601
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,600
 What to kind of stop them going out, like kind of when I take my mum's car keys away

602
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,600
 when she's drunk.

603
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:42,600
 I was like, "Oh, it's fine, I can fly, I can fly, and I feel fine."

604
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,360
 It's for your own good.

605
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,360
 You'll thank me in the morning.

606
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:53,440
 So this thing about self-control is related to the really famous experiment of the marshmallow test.

607
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,440
 Yes.

608
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:59,880
 She was done in the 1960s, across the years of the 1960s, lots of them by the same scientist,

609
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,160
 whose name was Walter Michelle.

610
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:07,480
 And he tested children, he said, "You can have one marshmallow now, or I'll come back

611
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:11,320
 in 15 minutes, and you can have a second marshmallow if you haven't eaten the first one, but if

612
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:15,120
 you want to be the first one, just ring the bell, and I'll come back and you can eat it."

613
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,280
 Some kids just immediately ate the marshmallow without even ringing the bell.

614
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,280
 Just one.

615
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:25,240
 Yeah, but basically he found that children who were able to defer gratification ended up

616
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:29,480
 doing better in later life, they got in less trouble with the law, they were healthier,

617
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,000
 they paid more, this kind of thing.

618
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,240
 What I would have done is when he left the room, I would have hollowed out the marshmallow

619
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,240
 and eaten the middle.

620
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,520
 So you get the matter in our marshmallow, but then you leave it on the table so it looks

621
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,520
 like you don't need it.

622
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:44,520
 You are like the child who took an Oreo apart, licked the cream from the inside, and then

623
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,440
 put the Oreo back together.

624
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,760
 That's what happened in one of the experiments.

625
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,760
 What happened to him?

626
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:52,720
 He is our president of the United States.

627
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,240
 But actually kids are getting better at this, aren't they?

628
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:59,240
 There's been some work done this year, or quite recently, which found that the

629
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:06,360
 children are getting better by about six seconds per year, as in the average of how long people

630
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,360
 were waiting.

631
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:12,280
 And there was a guy who did this study was called John Protsko, and he asked a load of psychologists

632
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:16,280
 what they thought, and a load of child behavioural experts, what they thought.

633
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:22,000
 And only 16% thought that children's self-control had improved since the experiments of the 60s,

634
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,200
 and 52% was sure that children would have been much worse at it, but actually they're better.

635
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,200
 Wow.

636
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,400
 So it's not like now that everyone is just watching YouTube all the time.

637
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,080
 So does this mean that the intervals between are we nearly there yet?

638
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,960
 They're going to get six seconds longer every year?

639
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,960
 The one?

640
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,880
 Yes, so we are more nearly there than we used to be.

641
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:44,360
 Do you know who's also good at it?

642
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:48,240
 This experiment is a Camerunian children.

643
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,600
 They found out, I think this was this year in the last couple of years, so they repeated

644
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:56,240
 the marshmallow experiment with three to five year olds from Germany, and then three

645
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,720
 to five year olds from Camerun from the Nusso tribe.

646
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:06,200
 And they found that while 30% of the German kids managed to wait long enough to get the second

647
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,720
 treat, 70% of the Camerunian kids did, and they're not entirely sure why they think it might

648
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,720
 be because from this particular group of people have strict appearance, and so it makes them

649
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,960
 used to being patient and waiting for staff.

650
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,040
 But yeah, they're really good at it.

651
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,960
 In that experiment, 10% of the Camerunian children just fell asleep waiting.

652
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,960
 Yeah.

653
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,760
 They didn't have to, they didn't fall over the tall.

654
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,800
 And there's another theory about why it might be.

655
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,000
 Maybe you're right, it may be that they've got strict appearance, and they're just told

656
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,160
 to be quiet and be patient more.

657
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:39,400
 But also, there's a thing about how much you trust that you're going to get the second

658
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,400
 marshmallow at the end.

659
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,480
 Yeah, I was thinking that actually, when you first had the experiment, there were a few

660
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,480
 things like that.

661
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,760
 For instance, one, you might not be that hungry, you might think, you know why I only really

662
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:52,280
 want one marshmallow and two would be a bit much, so I'm just going to have this one.

663
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,160
 A good scientist would starve the children beforehand.

664
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,320
 Well, what do you mean by good in this room?

665
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,240
 Yeah, well, you might not like marshmallows on a body at all, so you might wait not because

666
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,240
 you've got self control.

667
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,480
 Hey, can I give you something more about ants?

668
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,480
 Yeah.

669
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,520
 So scientists have started putting barcodes on ants in order to monitor their behaviour,

670
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,920
 and they just look really cool.

671
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:18,960
 So this was said in passing in an experiment as to how ants respond to loneliness, which

672
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,120
 is a bit sad actually, they don't like it at all.

673
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,440
 So scientists plucked a few ants out of their colonies and they put them on their own and they

674
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,840
 fed them and everything, but they still died 10 times sooner than they would have otherwise.

675
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,400
 10 times sooner, that's terrible.

676
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,960
 They hit me on their own, because they don't live for long anyway, do they?

677
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,960
 They don't.

678
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,960
 I don't suppose they do, actually.

679
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,960
 I don't really know.

680
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:41,600
 Some ants queen ants can live to 20 years, which was quite amazing.

681
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,600
 That's incredible.

682
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,600
 That's true, rubbish.

683
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,680
 Queen ants are the only ants who can legally drink the alcohol in this experiment of

684
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:52,920
 ounces. Anyway, to monitor ants, then scientists have started putting these tiny barcode backpacks

685
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:58,080
 on them, and they glue them on, and this means they can just monitor all of their behaviour.

686
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,840
 So now we can really get detailed impressions of ant movement and everything, because we've

687
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:06,440
 got computers locked onto every barcode, but we're only going to learn about ants that carry

688
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,440
 backpacks around.

689
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,000
 Do you think their behaviour might change when you put a backpack on them?

690
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,240
 Yeah, they'll probably think they're on that gap here.

691
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:19,200
 They'll probably just go cleaning their chakras and whatever.

692
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,000
 We've learned that ants really find themselves.

693
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,520
 There's an ant expert called Clint Penic, who says he can identify different ants by their

694
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,800
 ferrimones, just by smelling them.

695
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,800
 He's lying.

696
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,640
 Well, he did it successfully for his mate.

697
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,840
 He had an ant infestation, and he went and sniffed them, and those ants were the ones that

698
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,840
 smelled like blue cheese.

699
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,840
 Well, what does he do?

700
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,720
 He says, "Oh, that one's Derek, and that one's Arthur, and that one's..."

701
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,880
 He doesn't know all the individual ants by name, but he does know different types of ants,

702
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:51,240
 and he says, "Some smell like chocolate, but you have to crush their heads in order to smell

703
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,000
 it, so that's a bit of a shame."

704
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 Oh.

705
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,200
 Hello, I've brought my new pet ant, I wonder if you can tell me which kind of this place.

706
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,200
 Yes, of course.

707
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,200
 Crush.

708
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:15,320
 I'm afraid your ant was not one of the one-two's heads, but I was like, "Shorten up, I'm

709
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,320
 in front of the head."

710
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,320
 Okay, it's time for a final fact, and that is Alex.

711
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,280
 My fact this week is that when filming the famous hill scene at the beginning of The Sound

712
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:23,760
 of Music, the helicopter down-draft would knock Julie Andrews over after each take.

713
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,200
 I really want to see this be-roll.

714
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,200
 That's incredible.

715
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,760
 And she said this herself, right?

716
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:34,000
 Yeah, in some interview, in a sort of behind-the-scenes documentary, or I think it was actually

717
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,800
 a documentary by Sue Perkins, that she made about The Sound of Music and a town where it

718
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:43,320
 was filmed, because it's filmed in a town in Austria, and it was not a big film there.

719
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,560
 And most of the people who live there, they know it exists, but they've never seen it, and

720
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:50,200
 they're kind of a bit baffled by why Taurus, so many Taurus from the YouTube.

721
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,200
 It's actually in Germany as well.

722
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,200
 It's in Germany.

723
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,680
 The hill scene is filmed in Germany, which I think is a cruel irony given the plotline

724
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,680
 of the film.

725
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:01,000
 Well, the other cruel irony is that they only had enough budget for one day of helicopter shooting,

726
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,200
 so they hired the helicopter for one day.

727
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,680
 They filmed the very first scene of the movie with Julie Andrews spinning around on the

728
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:13,160
 hill a few times, then the helicopter immediately flew off over the mountains to film the very

729
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,160
 end of the film.

730
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,160
 The last scene, which is the Von Trapp family walking over the mountain.

731
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,160
 That's wireless.

732
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,160
 Yes, wireless.

733
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:24,200
 Which is someone in the film walking over the mountains, but the story is based on a real

734
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,680
 life family.

735
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:29,440
 In real life, they escape whatever was they running from by train.

736
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,440
 They escape the Nazi.

737
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,440
 I'm sorry, if you want to see the sound of music.

738
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,800
 I actually haven't seen the sound of the movie, but it's much of a spoiler.

739
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,200
 I mean, I did know that the Nazis didn't win the war.

740
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,200
 So they escape.

741
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,200
 They escape.

742
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:45,640
 They might have won this battle.

743
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:49,560
 In real life, the Von Trapp family escaped the Nazis via train, but in the film, they had

744
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:53,480
 them escaping by foot over the mountains, and they filmed them going over the mountains

745
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,760
 straight in the direction of Hitler's private chalet.

746
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:00,200
 So they would have bumped into Hitler, if he carried on watching the film after the credits.

747
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:05,440
 The post-credit scene is when they reveal a bit of the Marvel films, was it the Eagles

748
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,440
 Nest?

749
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,440
 Yes.

750
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,440
 Yes.

751
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,440
 Was the name of the private.

752
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:16,360
 The Eagles Nest would be a great sound of music too, even to the Eagles Nest.

753
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,360
 So she fell over.

754
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:22,520
 Because I was watching a Missbusters, because they were testing exactly the strength of

755
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:26,280
 a helicopter down draft, and they made this model head, and then they made a helicopter hover

756
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:31,040
 above it, and they tested the force that was coming down on it, and it's very small.

757
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:36,880
 So I was like 50 grams of force, and then it went up to about 100 grams as it accelerated

758
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,880
 upwards.

759
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,120
 It's pretty windy if you go near a helicopter.

760
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,120
 It's windy.

761
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:45,160
 And it came down very, it came down dangerously low, because it was pretty health and safety,

762
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:48,320
 and there was one point at which Gideon was like, "I thought I was going to lose my head."

763
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,360
 I just think she maybe was a bit weak.

764
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,560
 She probably was very slight, and she was a movie star.

765
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,720
 She were in a big dress.

766
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,720
 She was.

767
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,720
 Big, flowy dress.

768
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,880
 And she was on a quiet, steep mountain, and it was probably already windy, I'm sure.

769
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,480
 But apparently they did 10 takes of this, and she started screaming, "Okay, that's enough.

770
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,480
 I've had enough now."

771
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,120
 But the helicopter pilot couldn't hear her, so he took it to mean, "Yep, let's go around

772
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,120
 for another take."

773
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,120
 So he just kept going.

774
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,120
 Wow.

775
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:15,040
 It's weird that, because yeah, she said the helicopter pilot thought I was just saying,

776
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,040
 "Yeah, fine.

777
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,040
 Keep going."

778
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,560
 But you would have thought as the helicopter pilot, if you've watched yourself knock

779
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:24,040
 this woman flat on her face five times, you'd assume she was complaining about it by that

780
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,040
 point.

781
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,040
 Yeah.

782
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,040
 I think the downwash is quite strong.

783
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,280
 Yeah, maybe Mythbusters didn't crack the formula for a strong downdrop.

784
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,520
 I guess it depends on the helicopter, definitely.

785
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,080
 And it depends on a load of other things.

786
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:39,280
 But there is amazing footage online of a helicopter taking off.

787
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,920
 And as it goes, it just knocks over an entire row of porta-loos and it sends them all over

788
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,120
 the place.

789
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,360
 And there are huge ribbons of blue paper flying off into the sky.

790
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,360
 It's brilliant.

791
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,360
 Oh, wow.

792
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,360
 Yeah.

793
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:56,280
 There was a guy in Manchester who was playing golf this year and his ball was on the side of

794
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:02,400
 the green and a helicopter went past and blew his golf ball into the hole.

795
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,560
 Does that count?

796
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:08,360
 It doesn't know, but his mates didn't know that at the time, but they suspected it.

797
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:13,520
 He said that they didn't pay up the 50 pH they would have owed him for getting a burning.

798
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,160
 He said they accused me of colluding with a pilot.

799
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:20,160
 I'm now known as Chopper Henderson.

800
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:26,760
 Just on golf courses and helicopters, there was a really good cracked article that was written

801
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:31,000
 by a helicopter pilot who was talking about the ridiculous task he's been given as one.

802
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,560
 And he was once hired by some people who wanted to play golf to fly his helicopter across

803
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,760
 of about two grand an hour over the golf course to dry the greens because it had rained

804
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,760
 the night before.

805
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,760
 Yeah.

806
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,480
 He used that method to dry their crops.

807
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:51,120
 So for example, cherry farmers fly a helicopter really low because cherries get a lot of moisture

808
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,120
 on the outside right?

809
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,120
 Yeah.

810
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,120
 Or you can just blow the water off.

811
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,120
 Yeah.

812
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:58,960
 But if it soaks in, then the cherries will split after a certain point they can't absorb

813
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,960
 that much water.

814
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,120
 And then if it's split, there's a much higher chance it'll rot.

815
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:05,440
 So you just get a chopper to fly over a few times, dry cherries.

816
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,440
 Yeah.

817
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:14,800
 As a hotel in Sussex made of a converted helicopter and it's called the holy copter.

818
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,800
 Because of holiday.

819
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,800
 Yeah.

820
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,240
 I thought because it had holly the plant on it or it's like hollywood or...

821
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,240
 No.

822
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,240
 It's funny when you see it written down.

823
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,560
 Although it's still pretty funny when you say that loud.

824
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,560
 I love it.

825
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,560
 I think it's great.

826
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,280
 Drawing as a person called holy copter somewhere.

827
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,280
 Probably.

828
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,280
 No.

829
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,280
 Yes.

830
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,280
 No.

831
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,280
 Just counts on it.

832
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,040
 Must be somewhere.

833
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,240
 Copter sounds like a medieval job.

834
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,960
 Well, the thing is copter in helicopter is not the suffix.

835
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,120
 The suffix is pter.

836
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,120
 It's my favourite etymology of all time.

837
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,120
 Always has been.

838
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,120
 Yeah.

839
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,120
 It's helico, pter.

840
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,120
 I should tell you what that is.

841
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,120
 I should tell you what that is.

842
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,120
 I should tell you what that is.

843
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,120
 I should tell you what that is.

844
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,120
 That's what I call it.

845
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,120
 Because pter is like a pterodactyl, which means...

846
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,120
 Pterodactyl is wing, wing.

847
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,120
 Yeah.

848
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:01,360
 And helico, helix, so what the blade's been around, yeah.

849
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,360
 Yeah.

850
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:07,080
 What do you know when the helicopter, the first functioning helicopter, was invented and flown?

851
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:11,360
 Um, 1920.

852
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,360
 Nice.

853
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,360
 1784.

854
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,360
 Wow.

855
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,360
 What?

856
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,360
 I got the teen bit.

857
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,360
 You did very well.

858
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:23,360
 So in 1784, though, these two French inventors called Lornoi and Bianvenu.

859
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,360
 And they...

860
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:30,840
 I mean, that's me trying to write a French character and can't think very well.

861
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:35,720
 And he's called Bianvenu Panzelon.

862
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,720
 It was his real name.

863
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:42,840
 He was a very welcoming man, and he made a toy helicopter, but it had a rotary wing and the...

864
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:47,840
 Because they didn't have motors at that point, the power was provided by a spring mechanism,

865
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:52,840
 and they made it fly up in the air, and it was only a year after the first successful balloon flight,

866
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,680
 which feels like a big step in the right direction.

867
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,360
 So that was the first helicopter.

868
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,360
 Wow.

869
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:04,760
 I think you talked about on QI this year, or going in the coming series, how the BBC plan

870
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:10,360
 for the Cold War was to broadcast the sound of music on repeat in the event of a nuclear strike.

871
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,360
 Really?

872
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,360
 You know, because everything else would be pretty awful.

873
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:18,360
 Oh, and what we wouldn't find at awful having the sound of music on repeat for all of you to not see.

874
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,360
 This good news is me and Andy haven't seen it.

875
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,360
 Yeah.

876
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:25,360
 You're going to feel really guilty about that spoiler, Alex.

877
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:32,360
 Okay, that's it.

878
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,360
 That's all of our facts.

879
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,360
 Thank you very much indeed for listening.

880
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,360
