00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 We run it on QI a few years ago.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 Which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 It's a nice fish thing as a fish.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 It says it right there, first paragraph, no such thing as a fish.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 It's a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Colburn Garden.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Anna Chazinski.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 And we have a special guest today.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 He's a very close friend of ours.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 He's the co-creator and producer of Museum of Curiosity.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 And has a lot of claims to fame that we probably should mention.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 Tell you what, Rich, give us one of your claims to fame.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 Okay, I coined to the term "International Man of Mystery".

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 For the Austin Power movies, you knew one of the actors, right?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 Yeah, I knew Neil Malaki, who was working very closely with Mike Myers.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 Yeah, those two used to be a double act, didn't they?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 Yeah, they were a double act, that's right.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 And I used it as a program.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 In fact, it does come from a back page advert in the stage.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 And it was for a guy who was the International Man of Mystery.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 I can't remember his name.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 And Neil just took it and gave it to Mike Myers.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 I just thought it was a coincidence.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 But then Neil confirmed it to me that he passed that on.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 And that became the thing in the movie.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 Yeah, it was me.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 And you're also just not quite in charge of fire, right?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 Half of me is in charge.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 Yeah, there's a scene where there's a choir singing to be an Englishman on a stage.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 And I got moved, actually.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 I was near the middle.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 He was just even quieter.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 And he got moved nearer and nearer the centre.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 He's very tall, I think, that was to make a nice sort of like...

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 Trainsverted V shape.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 Yeah, kind of pyramid shape of heads.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 But I got moved right... I must be just ugly, also.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 I got moved right to the edge.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 And if you watch on a proper...

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 I mean, if you watch on an ordinary old telly, you won't see me at all.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 But widescreen.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 Yeah, widescreen, you'll be makes it in.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 Is it your better half, at least?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 It was my right-hand side.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 You tell me.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 I think most people think their left-hand side is their better half.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 Do they? Yeah.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 It's probably my evil side.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 Like, if you cut Nixon's face in half,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 and you make a kind of mirror image of one side,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 you get evil Nixon.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 Pretty sure both sides of Nixon were evil.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 Well, yeah, but evil people have more asymmetric faces apparently.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 Okay.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 Yeah, I'm sure that's a cute eye factor.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 People are going to be freaking out at home now looking at their wonky faces in the mirror.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 So it's really weird.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 You can see a nice happy smiling face if you do one side.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 And then a really scowling evil.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 Sinister.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 A convoluted way of saying, "Our special guest is Rich Turner."

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 Yeah, that's the Rich Turner podcast.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 There we go.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 Okay, so we've gathered around the microphone once again.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 And we brought with us our favorite four facts from the last seven days.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 So here we go in no particular order.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 These are our favorite things.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 Rich, we're going to start with you.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 A fact number one.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 Okay, when Neil Armstrong stepped on the moon and said

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 "That's one small step for a man."

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 Or, "For man, he was wearing ladies underwear."

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 That's really...

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 Did you get that fact from Buzz Aldrin when we met him last year?

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 Yeah, he's just like slapping him down.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 They were both wearing ladies underwear as a matter of fact.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 So when Apollo needed to get their spacesuits made,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 they ended up asking playtex, the bra manufacturers, to make the spacesuit.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 So they actually got the women from the production lines at their factory.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 And they made the spacesuits.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 They made, I think it's 21 layers, all made by them.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 So effectively, all of the same technology, all the same skills,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 all the same stuff as we're making bras and girdles.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 And that's what they were.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 And you know, look at those pictures again and think of that.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 It's a great big playtex bra that they're wearing.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 And it makes sense.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 It's actually, you look at the stitching.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 The stitching, the clasp.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 I were trying to take it off and they couldn't quite fumble around.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 Buzz could do it one handed, he was right about that.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 Why did they choose a latex?

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 Why did they choose that company to make the suits?

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 Playtex, I think it's because they had the skills with the stitching.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 Actually, they were the only people that knew how to make that.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 I mean, something like three rows of stitches and a row, tiny, tiny stitches.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 Great deal of precision required.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 And they won the contract because they were the best at doing it.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 Well, they made out of latex.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 But parts of the space suit were made of latex, yeah, I think they were.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 Were they frilly?

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 I understand that the space suits now are, they haven't been washed.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 They're still covered in moon dust.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 So they're sitting in the back rooms of a museum somewhere.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 Yeah, and I've read that when ex Apollo astronauts like to go to a museum to revisit the whole experience of going to space,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 they don't go to the Smithsonian to look at the rockets and the capsules.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 They go to the space suit museum or wherever it is.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 There's a space suit in the science museum, isn't there in London?

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 I don't know.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 I've seen it. It's quite cool because it has, like, where you would think are the, what do you call it?

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 The arm seams?

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 Yeah. So where the seams are, do you think it's the seams?

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 Actually, it's little pipes where they used to put water up there to keep people warm or cool.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 It's one of the undergarment layers, yeah. Actually, that was a British invention.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 That was invented for British fighter jet pilots to keep them warm.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 I think it was one of the proudest moments.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 I think Patrick more flagged it up on the day of the moon, ending to remind people that there was something British that was up there.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 Something British on the moon.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 There's not many British things on the moon, are there?

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 We were talking the other day, you and I, about Patrick more.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 And you were convinced that he had a crater on the moon.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 Yeah. But he doesn't. It was a different one.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 Really?

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 Well, well, he, I mean, the one that Rich thought that was Patrick more has turned out to be another more.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 Another more.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 Roger more?

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 Yes, Roger.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 From MoonRaker.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 MoonRaker.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 Is that just a film with Roger more raking out in Fraser on the moon?

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 Where does MoonRaker and the name come from?

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 Because there is, they call, there's a town in Wiltshire, or somewhere, where they call the MoonRakers.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 Because supposedly, they were so stupid, they saw a moon inside the lake and they tried to get it out.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 But, I don't know where that comes from, James Bond.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 Well, so we think to put a Bond movie about, isn't it?

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 Yeah.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 Based in Wiltshire.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 Well, Neil Armstrong's boots are supposed to be around this space and where aren't they?

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 Are they? I thought they're in a museum, wow.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 I think the, well, the, the, what's it called, the Silicon Rubber?

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 Right.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 They're called overshoes.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 They're like galoshes that they had on, on the space suit.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 They actually, I think through them off, I think they're on the moon.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 Oh, I think they, they're among the many things that they chucked onto the moon and left there.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 There's the lovely Hasselblad cameras at all up there, except one.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 I think one came back home and that was auctioned recently for quite a lot of money, I can't remember how much.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 Yeah, I can imagine.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 It's so kind of how tolerant we are of littering on the moon.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 I can't remember how many billions of tons it is, but there's like some billion tons of litter in space,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 and then a lot of people have left litter on the moon.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 Yeah.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 And it's basically fine.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 Well, there's a strict laws now about space junk, because we're, it's getting to the point now.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 I mean, the movie, that's the whole point of the movie, Gravity, was that they were pointing out that

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 we'll reach this point where we can't actually leave our planet because of these spinning bits of debris that are just

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 hurtling around the planet six times the speed of a bullet.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 So it's, it's been, it's been a bit concerned.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 I'll top of it on the moon.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 They've actually turned, or they're trying to turn certain areas of the moon into sort of like national parks, as it were,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 so that no one could, because the Chinese are now going there, India have got plans to go there,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 and they want all these heritage spots like the Apollo 11 moon landing spot to be,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 to be preserved.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 Isn't that typically American?

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 You go and trash a place.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 The bits that you've trashed, you declare to be preserved, to be preserved as a national park.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 Yeah.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 You get the rest.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 Well, the thing is, I reckon if they call it a national park, then technically it's going to be an American national park.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 So that means part of the moon would be American.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 Yes.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 You're not allowed to claim parts of the moon, are you?

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 You're not allowed to, but that's a technicality.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 There is, there is a scam, and I come to what it's called.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 In fact, there are a whole bunch of scams that allow you to buy land on the moon,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 and they look surprisingly plausible, but definitely not a thing.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 If anyone's bought land on the moon, you do not own land on the moon.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 No, but there is something on the moon that does belong to an individual millionaire on earth,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 and that's the lunar rover that was sent up by the Russians.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 It landed at the same time that Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were on there,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 and it was a remote rover that would pick tops and rocks.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 And the Russians left it there, and they're a bit short of money for their space programme,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 so they auctioned it off.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 Someone wanted it.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 Not really.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 So that landed within the same time frame,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 literally on the same day?

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 No, it must have been there.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 It was moving on the surface of the moon when they were moving around.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 That's fantastic.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 I'm not worried about that.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 Anyway, on Underwear.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 Yes, let's go back to Underwear.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 And still for Underwear, guys.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 You can buy flatulence filtering underwear now.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 Oh, yeah, it's handy.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 It's called Freddy's.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 It doesn't do that anyway for years.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 I'm so sorry, everyone.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 But yeah, isn't that good?

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 You can buy it for like $35, and they're called Shreddies,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 and they're made of a special kind of carbon,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 which apparently absorbs the smell.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 Yeah, I'll be like graphite kind of stuff.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 They actually call it Zorflex,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 but I think that might be a made-up word.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 It'd be a bit like charcoal, which would normally stop normal smells.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 So if you can't afford a pair, you could just put some charcoal in your pants.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 Yes.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 So the British troops in World War II,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 some British troops, had a secret plan to go into battle in Women's Underwear.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 This was a Scottish group.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 They were kilts wearing soldiers,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 and they were worried that their legs would be in exposed poisonous gas,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 and obviously other parts underneath the kilts

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 that they wouldn't normally cover would be hit by the poison gas.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 So they did tests to see if it would work,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 if they were long stockings and woolen bloomers,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 and the test showed that it would work,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 but it was decided that the protective clothing

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 would be too costly to supply all Scots regiments,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 and so they just banned kilts from the battlegrounds.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 That's tragic.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 So when did they ban kilts?

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 1940.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 Really?

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 Oh, that is a shame.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 What, they don't march into battle in a kilk anymore?

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 Not on the battleground.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 They can march ahead, but they wouldn't fight in it.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 So it's just for dressing up at weekends now.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 James Joyce always used to keep a pair of dolls knickers in his pocket,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 but apparently he always kept them there,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 and then when he got really drunk sometimes,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 he would take them out, put them on his fingers,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 and then do like a little dance on the table with his fingers

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 I'm doing the dance for people at home.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 That does what she's entertaining.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 Yeah, so it's a party trick.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 That's much better than his books.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 It's a bit easier to understand than Eulice.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 Yeah, Eulice.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 Is anyone read Eulice?

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 I started reading it.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 I started reading it as well.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 It's completely unreadable, isn't it?

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 It was pretty dense.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 It was so unreadable that when it first came out,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 it got banned in Britain because they thought it was written in code.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 Well, that's true.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 That's true.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 Das Kapital was the reason it was allowed to be published,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 I only found this out yesterday.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 They knew that it was like revolutionary, dangerous stuff,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 but it was deemed by the publishing powers that be,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 that it was totally dense, unreadable,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 and no one would ever make it through it.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 And it would have a really conceivable impact.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 Wow.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 It is.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 Okay, it's time to move on to fact number two.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 And that is my fact.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 My fact is that in 1963, Muhammad Ali released a stand-up comedy album.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 Wow.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 Yeah, that's good.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 Cool.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 Cool.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 It was called "I Am The Greatest".

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 I didn't know he intended it to be comedy,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 so it was meant to be funny,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 because it was kind of marketed as like a cabaret sort of thing.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 Yeah, it says this is the blurb on the back.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 It says, "Yep, it's no empty boast.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 As the greatest sportsman of the last, this or any century does his thing

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 in a hilarious, amazing collection of stand-up poetry and wrapping,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 just prior to entering the history books by becoming the greatest ever,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 cap locks, heavyweight champ of all time."

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 So that's the kind of, yeah, stand-ups in there.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 And the reason I know about this is was I was in HMV walking around,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 looking at the audio comedy section,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 and you know, Peter Cook, Jerry Seinfeld, Muhammad Ali.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 I was like, "What is this doing here?"

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 It's interesting, though, because this was when he was a rising boxing superstar.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 It was at the time when he was doing quite well.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 He wasn't yet world champion.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 And also the year in 1963, it's a really interesting year.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 It was the year that Bill Cosby released his first album.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 It was kind of the period where stand-up comedy was really being turned into something.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 So you could argue that the album that he released, Muhammad Ali,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 was a spoken word album.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 But I think it's only called a spoken word album

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 because of the context of the time that it was released in.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 But it was a guy on stage telling jokes,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 reading funny poems to an audience who were laughing along to it.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 He was basically like the predecessor of Tim Key.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 I don't, maybe he was serious, so he was a famously not a humble man.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 I think he had the impression in his head that he was the greatest

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
 because he did some extraordinary things.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 Like, there's a clip on YouTube that you can see of

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 when a guy is standing on the edge of a building ready to commit suicide.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 He's just lost it and the police are there and everything.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 They're filming it. It's just a news crew filming it

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 and suddenly someone just goes, "And then Muhammad Ali arrived

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 and he comes running to the building with his entourage.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 He gets up. He's in the other window and he talks the man down."

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 Yeah, it's this is an amazing shot.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 It's also interesting the way that, because it's just on that idea

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 of that sort of idea that he could just run up to a building

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 and talk someone down and they would just allow him.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 "Oh, Muhammad Ali is here. Yeah, let him chat to the guy."

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 Step back.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 That's a lot better than when Paul Gascon turns up

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 with a fishing rod and some chicken.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 Yeah, I'm actually trying to think of any sports person alive today

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
 who could do anything about that.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 Actually, there was some of the England cricket team talk

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 to Guy Offerbridge in Australia.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 Yeah, in Australia last year.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 Yeah.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 Stuart Broad was there.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 Stuart Broad and can't remember who else.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 The prior, I think.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 Yes.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 You know the famous Rumble in the Jungle match?

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 Yes.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 George Foreman.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 It was an African country.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 Yeah, in Zaire.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 He was in Kinshasa.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 Yes.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 This is not an amazing fact.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000
 I just didn't know it.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
 Because of the time difference,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 the match was fought at 4 a.m. in the morning.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 Yeah.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 So everyone in the country who came to watch it

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 because it was such a big event,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 they were all there at 4 a.m.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 Muhammad Ali was up at 4 a.m.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 It's one of those times where you don't know whether it's best

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 to stay up for it or get up early.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 Yeah.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 And then you actually only fall asleep at 3.30.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 Yeah.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 I think the government paid a huge amount.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 It was in Zaire.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 Yes, it was.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 Yeah.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 I think the Zaire government paid a huge amount of money to have it there,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 didn't it?

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 Because it was going to help terrorism and help draw attention to it.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 Yeah.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 It's a big tourist hotspot now.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 Democratic Republic of Canada isn't it?

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 Work like a charm, guys.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 It's just so much.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 Okay.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 So just speaking, just going into boxing,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 rather than Muhammad Ali,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 the first rules of boxing,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 the first codified rules were the Queen's Be Rules.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 And they had an explicit rule for bidding boots with having springs.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 Which is quite good.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 So before that, you're allowed boots with springs.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 Presumably, someone must have gone to a boxing match

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 with springs on his boots.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 And they had to bat it.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 Yeah.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 That sounds like it would just be really quite cum some are not very helpful.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 I know.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 Or you could bounce over them and then hit them on the back of the head.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 That's true.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 Seriously good spring.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 I was thinking you should get springs on your back.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 So when you're knocked down, just come right back up again.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 Hope you're great.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 Like one of those toys you get.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 Another rule about boxing.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 In the 18th century, most boxes had long hair.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 But they stopped that after referees made it legal to hold your opponents hair

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 with one hand and hit him with the other.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 OK, we're going to have to wrap up on this one.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 Is anyone?

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 He was also a magician, wasn't he?

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 Yeah.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 Yeah, Muhammad Ali could do magic tricks.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 He was a magician as well.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 Really?

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 Yeah.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 I can't imagine.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 Well, I don't know.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 His son, Muhammad Ali Junior, who's a very poor man now

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 because he's been sort of cut off by Muhammad Ali's third wife.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 Yeah.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:41.000
 Now, he remembered that he's dad used to do magic tricks in the ring when he was, when he was in training.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 Yeah, he used to make handkerchiefs disappear.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 And he used to do like a levitation trick where you stand on the tiptoes of one toe

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 and it makes it look like you're levitating.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 But because of his Islamic beliefs, he wasn't allowed to deceive anyone.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 So he would always explain exactly how his tricks were done as soon as he'd done them.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
 I was thrown out of the magic circle pretty swiftly.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 I wouldn't like to be the balancer to throw him out of the magic circle, do you?

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 I got one last fact for Muhammad Ali.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 Do we all know what he changed his name from Cassius Clay to?

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 Muhammad Ali.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 I know what you've been saying.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 Yeah, it's nice.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 Is it Cassius X?

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 Yeah, Cassius X.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 And he did it because he was with Malcolm X at the time hanging out with him.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 So there was the X-men.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 And how long did you keep that name for long then?

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 No, he didn't.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 He only had it because while he was waiting to get a verified name from the nation of Islam,

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 didn't he?

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 When he decided to shake Cassius Clay because that was his slave name.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 But the nation of Islam, Elijah Muhammad had to give him a proper name.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 And so he took Cassius X and the interim.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 I think that's what that was like.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 Yeah, it is.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 Yeah.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 Might use that next year.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 Cool.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 You heard it here first, guys.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 Yeah.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 All right.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 Okay.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000
 Time for fact number three.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 And that is Chazinsky.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 Yep. My effect is that in 1325 in Italy, war was declared and 2000 people were killed because of a stolen bucket.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 Okay.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 The war of the Okan bucket.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 Okan bucket.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 So it was there were two rival city states, Bologna and Medina at the time.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 And Modenese soldiers stole the bucket, the Bolognaese bucket from their city well.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 And it had some loot in it, apparently, that I guess they'd acquired in other kind of battles.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 And they stole the bucket.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 And so Bologna declared war on them and brought a 32,000 strong army to invade and reclaim the bucket.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 You could say that the crusades, I mean, it all depends on how you translate words for sort of a vessel that holds things.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
 But you could say that the crusades were all fought over a bucket, couldn't you?

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 Go on.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 The holy bucket.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 The holy grail.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 Yeah, good. Yeah, I mean, these are ancient languages, it might be just a bucket.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 I like wars that have started over really apparently minor and comical.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 Such as?

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 Such as The War of Jenkins Ear. That's quite a famous one isn't it?

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 What was that?

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 So Jenkins was a British privateer in 1738 and he went out to the Americas and his ear was cut off by Spanish,

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 who were also in the Americas, privateering themselves.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 And so he came back to Britain and he brandished his ear in Parliament.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 And I was like, look what those Spanish guys have done to me.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 And so they went to who?

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 Oh.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 Over here.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 What to get the ear back or?

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 Oh, no, he had the ear.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 Just because they were so irritated that the Spaniards dead cut off the ear.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 It kind of makes you wonder about the butterfly effect really.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 That maybe every war in the world was started by something incredibly tiny.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 Tiny, yeah.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 Just we don't know what it was always.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 Just two people just going, you're it dick.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 Yeah.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 Did you say you won the war?

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 The War of Jenkins Ear, or the war.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 Of the bucket.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 Oh, yeah, the War of the Bucket.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 So the Modenese who'd stolen the bucket initially won the war.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 And you can still, if you go to Modena in their cathedral, you can see the bucket.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 It's proudly hung up as a symbol of their victory.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 Is it?

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 Wow.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 Yeah, an open bucket.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 Go check it out.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 Empty bucket. Nothing in it.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 I don't think there's anything in it now.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 Yeah.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 Here's a better reason for going to war.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 When the goals sacked Rome for the first time, it was because they'd recently drunk wine for the first time

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 and they wanted to take over the place where it came from.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 That caught into the other us.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 The best reason I've ever heard.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 That's good, isn't it?

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 It's amazing.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 This is amazing.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 The shortest war in history, the Britain Zanzibar War, you could argue, was started by a cricket match, basically.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 So it was in 1896 and it was started when Zanzibar declared war because British ships were in a harbour they weren't allowed to be in.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 But they were in the harbour because the British sailors on the ships wanted to participate in a cricket tournament.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 Oh.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 And there was a football war, wasn't there?

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 Between Nicaragua and Costa Rica, wasn't it?

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 Yes. I think we might have mentioned that on our Nicaragua cosplay book last.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 Yeah, I can't remember.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 But it was basically just, there was a lot of tension between the two countries.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 And then there was a football match.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 There was some problems in the stands, a bit of hulganism, and then that just turned into a full-scale war.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 And as in always in war, there were no real clear winners.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 Yeah.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 The Costa Rica has got a bit of form as well because they had the Google Maps world.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 Do you remember that one?

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000
 What was that?

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 What happened was, there's an island in a river between Nicaragua and Costa Rica.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 And they've been fighting over it for years, so this is really a pretext.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 But the Nicaraguan guy said, oh, they sent some people over there in Costa Rica.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 He was like, why are you doing that?

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 He said, well, just look at Google Maps, it's ours.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 And someone in Google Maps had put the border in a slightly different place than Costa Rica thought.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 And so they used Google Maps as a pretext for war.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000
 Didn't last very long.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:53.000
 And Google Maps kind of apologized.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 That's awesome.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000
 Okay, we should wrap up.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 And one more interesting bucket.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 Bring it.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 It's not even that good.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 The only other interesting bucket I could find.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 And it's kind of worth mentioning because it's about the Sentinelese people.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 And I don't know if that's how you pronounce it, but they're one of the few people in the world,

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 which we don't know anything about, because they're very hard to access.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 So they live in the Andaman Islands in the Bay of Bengal.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 And they, whenever outsiders try and sort of penetrate their culture,

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 then they get arrows shot at them and they're repelled.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000
 So no one is anything about them except sometimes people go and leave gifts for them.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 And so anthropologists have been in the past and they've left gifts of coconuts, bananas,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 pigs and buckets for them.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 And they take away all of these and they take them back into the forest with them.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 But they only take away red plastic buckets, but they refuse to take away green plastic buckets

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.000
 that are left for them.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 Nobody knows why.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 A mystery.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 Weird.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 Well, one day someone's going to get in there and be able to ask them why. That'd be great.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 I'll be the first question that should be asked.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 What's with the whole red bucket thing?

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 Okay, buckets are quite dangerous.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 The only stats I have are from 1996, but in that year, 10,907 Americans were taken to hospital

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 with injuries caused by buckets.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 Wow, did you get any details on the injuries?

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 Was that a prank's bucket on top of doors?

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 It could have been that, couldn't they? I was thinking people tripping over buckets.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 Yeah, that too.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 Or standing on one.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 Or some to get behind a horse, but a lot of Americans are into that apparently.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 What?

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000
 Yeah, no, there's a documentary on Channel 4 a little while ago that...

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 Are you talking about what I think you're talking about?

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 Yeah, I think the name for the documentary was Footprints on the Pale.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 And that's what the wife should look for.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 When she goes down to the barn to see if her husband's been...

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm curious.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 In the '50s, a lot of young Americans first experience of sex was with an animal.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 Right.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 I think the Kinsley Pot was slightly debunked a little bit, but yeah.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 All right.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000
 I mean, that obviously does go on in certain places, I suppose.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 And Footprints on the Pale?

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 Footprints on the Pale could just mean they were using it to climb onto the horse.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 I think that's what Richard's saying.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 It's a great country song title, isn't it?

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 Okay, now it's time to head to the final fact of the show.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 And that is James. James, what do you got?

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 Okay, my fact is there is a group of chimpanzees in Zambia

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 who were a blade of grass in their left ear as a fashion statement.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 That's quite cool.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 How do we know as a fashion statement?

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000
 Well, because there's no other use for it.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 And they've noticed that when it started with one chimpanzee called Julie in 2010

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 and she started walking around with this little bit of grass out of her ear.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 And then whenever she met another chimpanzee, they would put a piece of grass in there here

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000
 and it kind of spread like a meme around the Zambian forests.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 And so they think it's a cultural, fashionable thing.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000
 And the pictures are brilliant. We'll put one up on the website, but it's just literally like a...

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:03.000
 You know, like in sitcom, in sketches where you had like a farmer and he was chewing a long piece of grass.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 It's a bit like that, only it's sticking out of their ear.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000
 It's a long piece that sticks right in there, not behind there.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 No, right in there. And it's probably about, I would say, about 25 centimeters long.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 And they're just walking along with it sticking out. It's like an earring kind of thing.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:22.000
 It's great. I wonder if it's to do with the people who put that in our area, that bit of grass.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000
 And you're the guys who don't, so it's a tribal. The chimpanzees are going to make them, yeah.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:33.000
 The chimpanzees in the Caballe forest in Zambia, they use sticks to get their sticks to get honey.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 Whereas bedongo forest chimpanzees use leaf sponges.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 And it's always people who are part of this group. And if they move to the other group, they use their technique.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 So that seems to be a cultural thing as well.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 So there's quite a few, quite a lot of evidence of culture in chimpanzees.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 You know that mandrels use like sharpened sticks to clean out their ears with, but it seems like you can clean out your ear with grass.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 But yeah, they use sharpened sticks for that. And they also shave off sticks to pick out their toenails.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 They've been seeming doing that. So that's nice. That shows a bit of fashion consciousness.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 Yes. Or personal hygiene.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 Personal hygiene, yeah. Small than I do.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 Can I throw a completely left field? I'm just going on word association here.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 But you just mentioned toenails. And it's one of my favorite most recent facts that was that there's a museum in America, which one of its exhibits is possibly Elvis's toenail.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.000
 And because it was found in the carpet of his home, so they think it might be his.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000
 And that's just sitting there.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 Also not related, but I found out this week that Sir Walter Scott had a salt seller made from King Charles I's fourth cervical vertebra.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000
 Right. Just another celebrity body part.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000
 Yeah. Have you seen Charles Darwin's stick? Is walking stick?

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 No. Everyone should have a look at this. We'll put this on qi.com/podcast.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 But if you want to see in person and you live in London or coming to London, you can go to the welcome trust and they have it on display in their collection.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 And it looks like he's a bond villain. It's got this skull with with emerald eyes. Yeah, it looks really sinister.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 It's his walking stick and you go, that's not your walk. That's that's Satan's walk.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 I mean, that was just on his evil side. That's blowfelt.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 Yeah, yeah. It was a bit of an obsessive walker as well.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 I think he in his last home that he lived that he had a path made that he just walked and walked and walked round and round on this square.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 Someone who loved to explore, that's not very adventurous. I was reading about Stonehenge for something about the radio show that we're about to do.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 And it was about Charles Darwin that he was the first person to do an excavation at Stonehenge.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 But what he was actually doing was looking for earthworms. And he wanted to see how the digging of earthworms would affect the way that the stones would change how upright they were.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 But that was the first scientific thing done at Stonehenge. Wow.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 Wow, we really side-sweeping the chimpanzee facts. I know. Yeah, would you get back on track?

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000
 I'll tell you what, let's go to fashion. Okay.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:15.000
 Because there was a fashion in the 1860s amongst young ladies in England to walk with a limp in imitation of Alexandra Princess of Wales, a consult of Edward VII.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:21.000
 She'd had rheumatic fever when she was younger and she had a stiff knee. And so she walks around with a limp and everyone just copied her.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 And it lasted for 10 years for disappearing without a trace. It must be weird when you're a royal.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 Because you won't know if people are emulating you out of a sort of admiration for you or just say this.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 In the 18th and 19th centuries, I think there was a ban on wearing over a certain weight of clothes because heavy fabrics were only supposed to be worn by the wealthy.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:48.000
 It was a social thing. And so the poorer people used to not wear underwear so that they wouldn't have to exceed the weight limit.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 And also in the 18th and 19th centuries, I think in France, it was fashionable to wet your clothes a bit before you put them on so that when you're wearing them, it would become obvious.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 They would cling to your body and it would show that you weren't wearing underwear. Isn't that wrong?

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 There were some tree laws, weren't they, that said, the only people with a certain amount of money were allowed to wear certain things.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 I remember in France, it was something like, you weren't allowed to have more than 103 buttons on your clothes or something stupid like that.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:23.000
 That poor policeman is that the lower end of policing isn't it when you're counting buttons on women's dresses?

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 I'm sort of after job, I'm sure.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 I also was looking, this is actually when I was looking into your fact about underwear rich.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 It was only in the 1920s that women realised that it was good to sort of separate breasts for fashion.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 So pre-1920s and let's say in 1905, for instance, a French bus supporter came out that was really, really fashionable and it effectively unified the breasts and the mono-boob was basically the only fashion until the 1920s.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 You just have to have one single-boob.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 But you mean like a boob chie, right? You don't mean like it looked like one boob.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 Well, it used to talk about a woman's bosom, didn't they?

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 Exactly. They thought they had one.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 And then were horrified. I like the coin, the Wikipedia page that says, "until the 1920s, breasts were always treated on mass."

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:18.000
 Okay, we need to wrap up. Anyone got any last second facts you want to throw in?

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.000
 Oh, one interesting thing on animals wearing clothes. Obviously they didn't wear clothes out of choice, but I love Harry.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 There are a couple of people, so putting animals on clothes is much older than you think.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 And what do we call it when cats do it? Like, lol cats. Oh yeah, lol cats.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000
 Oh yeah, lol cats. I think putting clothes on animals.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000
 On animals, exactly. So it happened in the 19th century, like I called Harry pointer.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000
 And then there was this guy called Harry Whittier Freeze, who lived from 1879 to 1953.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.000
 He was a photographer who made his entire living out of dressing up cat dogs, rabbits, etc.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 And they're really cute. I'll put some of these pictures on the website as well, if we can get them.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:56.000
 But he preferred cats because he said, "Rabbit's are the easiest to photograph in costume, but incapable of taking many human parts."

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.000
 Poppy's attractible when rightly understood, but the kitten is the most versatile animal actor

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000
 and possesses the greatest variety of appeal. So there you go, cats are the best actors.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.000
 Yeah.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:15.000
 Okay, that's it. That's the end of our show. That's all our facts. Thanks everyone for listening.
