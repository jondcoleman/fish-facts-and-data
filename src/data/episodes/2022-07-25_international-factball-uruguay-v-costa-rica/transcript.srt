00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
 Hello and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish" presents the World Cup of Facts.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,840
 This is the only World Cup podcast out there that makes absolutely no mention of football whatsoever.

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,680
 Brought to you by the QILBs in association with Visitingland.com.

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:19,600
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I am joined by James Harkin, Aniches Zinski and Andy Murray

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,760
 and today's match is Uruguay versus Costa Rica.

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,400
 Let's begin with Uruguay.

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,000
 I've got a fact, it's actually the only fact I've got about football for any country of research.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,960
 Wait a minute, this is supposed to be a non-football football contest.

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,440
 Okay, if you just heard the intro, I'll dress it up as a newspaper fact.

10
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:36,960
 Okay.

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,120
 The first time that Uruguay won the World Cup in 1930?

12
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,240
 In 1930, the fact was not even reported in the Times.

13
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,120
 That is how little esteemed sports news was then.

14
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,440
 So they're just really a loof?

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,440
 They might be fantastic of football.

16
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,000
 They are actually pretty good, aren't they?

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,040
 Well, actually they are very good at football because they've managed to win the World Cup twice.

18
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,440
 Despite having a tiny population, what was it, Andy?

19
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,720
 You were saying it's 3.5 million, which is about the same as the West Midlands.

20
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,520
 It's very small.

21
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,200
 We're not doing very well at this being a non-football football podcast, are we?

22
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,600
 Red cards around, no football chat.

23
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:17,080
 So Uruguay was besieged by the Argentine dictator Juan Manuel Ducrosas in the 1840s

24
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,440
 and they'd run out of proper ammunition

25
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,320
 and they held their own in battle and won by raiding the gannies of their ships,

26
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,840
 finding that they had quite a lot of Dutch cheese.

27
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,200
 Loaded up their cannons with what they now think,

28
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,400
 well, it was reported as e-down cheese, but Mythbusters looked into it,

29
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,720
 concluded it had to have been Gerotska cheese, and they won.

30
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,640
 And they shot Gerotska cheese out of their cannons, penetrates the sales of the army ships

31
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,960
 and they won the battle.

32
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,800
 And then there'd be like little shrapnel of mini baby bells.

33
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,600
 Yeah, it would have been true.

34
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,360
 Where would we get a baby, though?

35
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,800
 Uruguay, we should say, it means either river of birds or river of shellfish.

36
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,880
 We don't know which one it means.

37
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,440
 I mean, that's quite a big, this, like, a bird or a fish, is a shellfish.

38
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,000
 A shellfish, even, yeah.

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,160
 What's for dinner tonight?

40
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,520
 Good news, it is.

41
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,360
 But I'm allergic to shit, I'm sorry, yeah, I can't tell you.

42
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,960
 Yeah, I literally do not know.

43
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,800
 Uruguay has three times as many cows as it has people.

44
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,720
 Well, it's where Frey Bentos comes from, isn't it?

45
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,640
 There's actually a town called Frey Bentos,

46
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,720
 which is where the stuff comes from, like the pies and the corn beef and all that.

47
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,760
 I think they've shot down, they've stopped making them, haven't they?

48
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,600
 Yeah, in the '70s, but we still, obviously, call it Frey Bentos.

49
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,440
 Well, it was so important during the war, they called Frey Bentos

50
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,280
 to town the kitchen of the world.

51
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,960
 And soldiers would say Frey Bentos instead of OK.

52
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,600
 Well, how are you feeling today?

53
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,720
 Frey Bentos.

54
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,560
 That's great.

55
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,080
 I like that.

56
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,280
 Someone's on a must pick.

57
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,880
 Just on the food kind of areas, you'd like a nice drink, national drink to go with it.

58
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:49,640
 And they have their national tree, when the leaves are turned into a tea, it's a laxative tea.

59
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,240
 That's their national tree.

60
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,720
 It's called the Ombu.

61
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,720
 The national drink is a laxative.

62
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,640
 If you said I would like to drink from your national tree,

63
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,960
 as you do when you go to countries and you say that, you would have a laxative.

64
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,120
 They obviously eat a lot of meat.

65
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,800
 And so that can block you up.

66
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,000
 But if they have laxatives as their national drink, then it will be all bad or so.

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,520
 Perfect.

68
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,400
 It's like doc leaves and nettles, isn't it?

69
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:18,000
 Some of their meat is glow-in-the-dark, or their sheep glow-in-the-dark anyway,

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,800
 because it was a Uruguayan scientist who injected jellyfish genes into sheep,

71
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,360
 and that makes them glow-in-the-dark.

72
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,400
 And it has a whole bunch of medical uses, they think now, and they've done it with other things.

73
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,880
 They think glow-in-the-dark cats with jellyfish genes might be used to cure AIDS, maybe in future.

74
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,160
 But that was a Uruguayan anyway.

75
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,480
 You get glow-in-the-dark sheep.

76
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,200
 Wow.

77
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:35,880
 Wow.

78
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,880
 That's great.

79
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,240
 There are their presidents, a good guy, isn't he?

80
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,160
 Do you all know about him?

81
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,680
 No.

82
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,680
 He was a Mojica.

83
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,800
 He was a guerrilla fighter, he was a socialist, and he became president.

84
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,760
 And he gives 90% of his income to charity.

85
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:55,080
 He lives in a farm, he never wears a tie, and he lives with his three-legged dog who lost a leg

86
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,480
 in a tractor accident.

87
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,480
 Oh, he became quite famous in the news recently.

88
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,480
 Yeah, he's famous.

89
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,480
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

90
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,920
 He's been 13 years in prison, but two of those years were in a well, in the bottom of a well.

91
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,920
 What?

92
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,560
 That was during the dictatorship that was the previous government before he came to

93
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,560
 power.

94
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,040
 Bit of a shock that if you were lifting out the award families, award supplies for the week.

95
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,200
 Oh my god, so it seems to have been a future president.

96
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,200
 It seems to have been a future president, isn't it?

97
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,800
 And it's three-legged dog.

98
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:27,280
 All officials in Uruguay have to make a personal wealth declaration every year, and in 2010, his

99
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:33,840
 entire declaration was £1,100, which is the value of his 1987 Volkswagen Beetle.

100
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,040
 I mean, that's pretty modest living.

101
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,040
 Wow.

102
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,040
 Yeah.

103
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,040
 Okay, here's another awesome Uruguayan.

104
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:47,400
 He's called Emilio Arénas, and he has the largest collection of key rings in the world.

105
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:54,600
 He has 56,630 non-duplicated keychains, which he's been collecting since 1955.

106
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
 Wow.

107
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,240
 Does he just own a lot of properties?

108
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,400
 Well, I think he's just a collector, because he was also in the Guinness Book of Records

109
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,560
 for having the world's largest collection of pencils.

110
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,560
 Good night.

111
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,560
 That's great.

112
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,680
 I'd like to imagine that you can never find his actual key, because he's just going around

113
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,680
 and around this.

114
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,680
 Yeah, yeah.

115
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,680
 He's going around key rings.

116
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,640
 Or you can never find a pen in his house.

117
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,640
 Pencils everywhere.

118
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,640
 Just need a pen.

119
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:24,640
 There's a cemetery in Uruguay, which has a Jewish cemetery, and there are QR codes.

120
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,080
 So you scan them in and you get all the information about the person and lots of details.

121
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,920
 Or you can look at the cemetery remotely if you type in the right code for the QR code.

122
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,880
 Oh, so it's like having an iPad gravestone?

123
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,880
 Exactly.

124
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,880
 Yeah.

125
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,880
 I think that's the way ahead.

126
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,880
 Go for it.

127
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,880
 Okay.

128
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,320
 I love your Wikipedia page on there when you go in there, you'll like take it up with me.

129
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,440
 It'll go on and just say, this body is a stub.

130
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,440
 You can help me.

131
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,440
 Yeah, expand.

132
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,760
 With honor, it'll just be a Nokia 5510.

133
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,840
 It'll send you a text.

134
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,840
 Yeah.

135
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,840
 Okay.

136
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,120
 That's the halftime whistle there, which means it's time for our halftime show, which comes

137
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,800
 in the form of a QI quiz brought to you by VisitingLin.com.

138
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,320
 So we've got three questions for this one and we're going to start with James.

139
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,320
 Question number one.

140
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,320
 Okay.

141
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,680
 My question is why during World War One did someone come up with the idea to build an enormous

142
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,680
 fake mountain in Kent?

143
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,680
 Mm.

144
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,680
 Duh, duh, duh.

145
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,680
 Andy.

146
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,480
 So George is the patron saint of England now, but who was the patron saint of England before

147
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,480
 he was?

148
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,000
 Question number three, Chazinski.

149
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 Yeah.

150
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,360
 My question is, what is Big Ben?

151
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,360
 Good question.

152
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,360
 Good question.

153
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,360
 Okay.

154
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,720
 There's our good questions.

155
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,880
 If anyone wants to find out the answer to these questions, you better stay tuned to our

156
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,800
 show because they're coming right at the end.

157
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,000
 But until then, we've got a match to sort out.

158
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,800
 So it's time for the second half and we're heading over to Costa Rica.

159
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,120
 I love this fact.

160
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,480
 Costa Rica doesn't do proper addresses.

161
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:58,000
 They don't have really street names or house numbers and the way you post a letter or the

162
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,600
 way you direct someone somewhere is just by landmarks.

163
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,040
 So the postman have the worst life ever.

164
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,800
 Every single letter is just like turn left to the post office by the edge of the street that's

165
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,320
 a bit dark coloured and then there's a big oak tree to the east of you.

166
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,800
 And they do say it's hellish.

167
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,640
 So they would have like a really massive envelope if you lived a long way, right?

168
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,720
 It's like turn left here and then right there and then I would have ridden you a letter,

169
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,440
 but there was no space after your address.

170
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,880
 One of them said, they give me strange directions sometimes.

171
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:31,160
 So for instance, I'll be told to walk 300 metres north and then walk back 250 metres.

172
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,160
 It just sounds like hell.

173
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,160
 That's great.

174
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,360
 It sounds like they're just trying to punish their postman, doesn't it?

175
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,360
 Yeah.

176
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,560
 I think they're not the only, I think Dubai and Abu Dhabi have a similar, my sister, they

177
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,120
 used to live in Dubai trying to send letters to her was exactly that.

178
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,080
 And she said, if you got a taxi home at night, you had to direct them home like literally.

179
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,600
 It wasn't like, bring me here, it was like, I'll show you the way.

180
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,320
 Taxi drivers will just have the ignorance.

181
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,320
 Yeah.

182
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,400
 Let's go back to Costa.

183
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,400
 Yeah, anyway.

184
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,960
 Costa Rica's first female president was called Laura Chinchilla, which is quite a nice name.

185
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,600
 And one of the founders of the Communist Party was called Carlos Fallos.

186
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,600
 Nice.

187
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,760
 No, and their currency is the Colond.

188
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,760
 Oh yeah, it is.

189
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,760
 Yeah.

190
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,080
 Probably named after Christopher Columbus or his son, maybe.

191
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,400
 Or his anus.

192
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:22,320
 I really like the fact that in 1852, Costa Rica didn't have a national anthem, but they were

193
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,840
 being visited by UK and US diplomats.

194
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:30,520
 And so they basically in Costa Rica went, I guess we need to get a national anthem, the commission

195
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,200
 to national anthem just for the visit.

196
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
 And then it stuck.

197
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,200
 Wow.

198
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,160
 Yeah, and then they didn't add words to it until the 1900s.

199
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,560
 So they didn't have time for lyrics?

200
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,520
 Yeah, they're like, we need a focus on one element of this right now.

201
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,520
 We might get away with it.

202
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,000
 Everyone just murmur our language.

203
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,240
 They don't speak it anyway.

204
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,240
 It's all fine.

205
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,640
 Well, they don't have an army.

206
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,640
 Costa Rica.

207
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,640
 They don't know.

208
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:56,120
 But years ago, the government in 1949, they had a civil war and then one of their leaders,

209
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:01,400
 Jose Fuguerrez Ferrer, seized power to defeat an electoral fraud and then dissolved his own

210
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,400
 army.

211
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,640
 But they still have a defense budget.

212
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,680
 I think they just spent it on a military-trained police force.

213
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,680
 Yeah.

214
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,680
 Sounds a little bit like an army.

215
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,680
 But yeah.

216
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,680
 It's somatic.

217
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,280
 It's crucially not quite that much.

218
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,280
 Yeah.

219
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:20,680
 It's work for them though, not having an army because I think it was in 2009 with 143 nations.

220
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,160
 They're the happiest in the world.

221
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,320
 The happiest nation and the greenest nations in the most eco-friendly in the world.

222
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,120
 They have a lot of animals there, don't they?

223
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:35,200
 I read a fact that they have 0.03% of the planet's surface, but they are home to 500,000

224
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,200
 unique species.

225
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,200
 Yeah.

226
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,200
 Wow.

227
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,400
 That's four percent of all known species on Earth.

228
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,400
 That's amazing.

229
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:46,360
 There's seven volcanoes in this tiny, tiny country, seven active volcanoes and 120 volcano

230
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,360
 formations.

231
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,360
 Yeah.

232
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,080
 Amazing butterflies, 10% of all the world's butterflies.

233
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,040
 I think it may be an even higher proportion of Mars.

234
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,720
 I think my all-time favourite Costa Rica fact is going to be that when an American fruit

235
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,720
 company went over there and started clearing lands to grow bananas, they found these massive

236
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,200
 stone balls.

237
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,680
 No one knows what the balls were for, no one knows why they're there, but they were the

238
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,080
 things that inspired the big ball that chases Indiana Jones at the start of Raiders of the

239
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,080
 Lost Out.

240
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,080
 Very cool.

241
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,080
 They don't know why they're there.

242
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,080
 No one knows.

243
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,080
 That one has a mystery.

244
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:23,400
 Okay, that's the final whistle there, but before we find out who has won today's match,

245
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,720
 Uruguay Costa Rica, we're going to get the answers to that visitingland.com quiz that

246
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,320
 we had at our halftime show.

247
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,720
 So the answers are starting with James.

248
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,720
 Okay.

249
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,240
 The idea of building an enormous fake mountain in Kent was to make it tall enough to get

250
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,240
 the high ground against German bombers.

251
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,680
 That would have been a big mountain.

252
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,680
 Yeah.

253
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,680
 Okay.

254
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,680
 Question number two was from Andy.

255
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,280
 The original patron saint of England, perforced in George, was King Edward the Confessor,

256
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,760
 who was patron saint after he was king until 1066.

257
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,960
 So Big Ben is not a clock.

258
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,240
 Big Ben is the name for the bell within the clock.

259
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,240
 Ah.

260
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,080
 Is it true that it was named after a big guy called Ben who was an MP?

261
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,080
 Is that true?

262
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,080
 I don't.

263
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,080
 Ben was a complete bell.

264
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,080
 Okay.

265
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,080
 Well, there's the answers.

266
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:18,000
 If you want to win any QI goody prizes, sort of like books and so on, there's an additional

267
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,200
 quiz that's going on visitingland.com.

268
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,120
 So if you head over there, you get a chance to win some of the books.

269
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,640
 All the elves are going to sign the copies of the books and there's probably more going

270
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,640
 on there as well.

271
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,880
 So now it's time to decide who's won this match.

272
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:34,920
 I'm going to decide it today and I'm going to go for Costa Rica because I'm a massive

273
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,720
 Indiana Jones fan and I love the idea that those bulls are out there and they exist and

274
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,720
 they inspired it.

275
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,720
 Okay.

276
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,720
 So that's it for this match.

277
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,280
 But join us again tomorrow where there's going to be another great battle between two

278
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,040
 nations and they are James.

279
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,240
 They are France and Honduras.

280
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,240
 France and Honduras.

281
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,240
 Okay.

282
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,240
 Great.

283
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,480
 In the meantime, if you want to ask us anything about the things we were talking about in

284
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,400
 this particular podcast, you can get us all on our Twitter handles.

285
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,400
 I'm on @triberland.

286
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,400
 Andy.

287
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,400
 @andruhunteram.

288
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,400
 James.

289
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,400
 @egshaped.

290
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:08,000
 And I'll reply to you @quickipedia or you can also email in to elves@QI.com.

291
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 Okay.

292
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,120
 So we'll see you tomorrow for another match of the World Cup of Facts.
