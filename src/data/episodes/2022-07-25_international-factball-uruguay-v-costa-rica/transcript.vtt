00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680
 Hello and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish" presents the World Cup of Facts.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.840
 This is the only World Cup podcast out there that makes absolutely no mention of football whatsoever.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.680
 Brought to you by the QILBs in association with Visitingland.com.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.600
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I am joined by James Harkin, Aniches Zinski and Andy Murray

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.760
 and today's match is Uruguay versus Costa Rica.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.400
 Let's begin with Uruguay.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.000
 I've got a fact, it's actually the only fact I've got about football for any country of research.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.960
 Wait a minute, this is supposed to be a non-football football contest.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.440
 Okay, if you just heard the intro, I'll dress it up as a newspaper fact.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.960
 Okay.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.120
 The first time that Uruguay won the World Cup in 1930?

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.240
 In 1930, the fact was not even reported in the Times.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.120
 That is how little esteemed sports news was then.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.440
 So they're just really a loof?

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.440
 They might be fantastic of football.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.000
 They are actually pretty good, aren't they?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.040
 Well, actually they are very good at football because they've managed to win the World Cup twice.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.440
 Despite having a tiny population, what was it, Andy?

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.720
 You were saying it's 3.5 million, which is about the same as the West Midlands.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.520
 It's very small.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.200
 We're not doing very well at this being a non-football football podcast, are we?

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.600
 Red cards around, no football chat.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:17.080
 So Uruguay was besieged by the Argentine dictator Juan Manuel Ducrosas in the 1840s

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.440
 and they'd run out of proper ammunition

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.320
 and they held their own in battle and won by raiding the gannies of their ships,

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.840
 finding that they had quite a lot of Dutch cheese.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.200
 Loaded up their cannons with what they now think,

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.400
 well, it was reported as e-down cheese, but Mythbusters looked into it,

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.720
 concluded it had to have been Gerotska cheese, and they won.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.640
 And they shot Gerotska cheese out of their cannons, penetrates the sales of the army ships

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.960
 and they won the battle.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.800
 And then there'd be like little shrapnel of mini baby bells.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.600
 Yeah, it would have been true.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.360
 Where would we get a baby, though?

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.800
 Uruguay, we should say, it means either river of birds or river of shellfish.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.880
 We don't know which one it means.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.440
 I mean, that's quite a big, this, like, a bird or a fish, is a shellfish.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.000
 A shellfish, even, yeah.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.160
 What's for dinner tonight?

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.520
 Good news, it is.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.360
 But I'm allergic to shit, I'm sorry, yeah, I can't tell you.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.960
 Yeah, I literally do not know.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.800
 Uruguay has three times as many cows as it has people.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.720
 Well, it's where Frey Bentos comes from, isn't it?

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.640
 There's actually a town called Frey Bentos,

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.720
 which is where the stuff comes from, like the pies and the corn beef and all that.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.760
 I think they've shot down, they've stopped making them, haven't they?

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.600
 Yeah, in the '70s, but we still, obviously, call it Frey Bentos.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.440
 Well, it was so important during the war, they called Frey Bentos

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.280
 to town the kitchen of the world.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.960
 And soldiers would say Frey Bentos instead of OK.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.600
 Well, how are you feeling today?

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.720
 Frey Bentos.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.560
 That's great.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.080
 I like that.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.280
 Someone's on a must pick.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.880
 Just on the food kind of areas, you'd like a nice drink, national drink to go with it.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.640
 And they have their national tree, when the leaves are turned into a tea, it's a laxative tea.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.240
 That's their national tree.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.720
 It's called the Ombu.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.720
 The national drink is a laxative.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.640
 If you said I would like to drink from your national tree,

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.960
 as you do when you go to countries and you say that, you would have a laxative.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.120
 They obviously eat a lot of meat.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.800
 And so that can block you up.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.000
 But if they have laxatives as their national drink, then it will be all bad or so.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.520
 Perfect.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.400
 It's like doc leaves and nettles, isn't it?

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:18.000
 Some of their meat is glow-in-the-dark, or their sheep glow-in-the-dark anyway,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.800
 because it was a Uruguayan scientist who injected jellyfish genes into sheep,

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.360
 and that makes them glow-in-the-dark.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.400
 And it has a whole bunch of medical uses, they think now, and they've done it with other things.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.880
 They think glow-in-the-dark cats with jellyfish genes might be used to cure AIDS, maybe in future.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.160
 But that was a Uruguayan anyway.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.480
 You get glow-in-the-dark sheep.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.200
 Wow.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:35.880
 Wow.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:36.880
 That's great.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.240
 There are their presidents, a good guy, isn't he?

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.160
 Do you all know about him?

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.680
 No.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.680
 He was a Mojica.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.800
 He was a guerrilla fighter, he was a socialist, and he became president.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.760
 And he gives 90% of his income to charity.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.080
 He lives in a farm, he never wears a tie, and he lives with his three-legged dog who lost a leg

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.480
 in a tractor accident.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.480
 Oh, he became quite famous in the news recently.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.480
 Yeah, he's famous.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.480
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.920
 He's been 13 years in prison, but two of those years were in a well, in the bottom of a well.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:06.920
 What?

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.560
 That was during the dictatorship that was the previous government before he came to

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.560
 power.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.040
 Bit of a shock that if you were lifting out the award families, award supplies for the week.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.200
 Oh my god, so it seems to have been a future president.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.200
 It seems to have been a future president, isn't it?

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.800
 And it's three-legged dog.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:27.280
 All officials in Uruguay have to make a personal wealth declaration every year, and in 2010, his

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:33.840
 entire declaration was £1,100, which is the value of his 1987 Volkswagen Beetle.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.040
 I mean, that's pretty modest living.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.040
 Wow.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.040
 Yeah.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.040
 Okay, here's another awesome Uruguayan.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:47.400
 He's called Emilio Arénas, and he has the largest collection of key rings in the world.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:54.600
 He has 56,630 non-duplicated keychains, which he's been collecting since 1955.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.600
 Wow.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.240
 Does he just own a lot of properties?

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.400
 Well, I think he's just a collector, because he was also in the Guinness Book of Records

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.560
 for having the world's largest collection of pencils.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.560
 Good night.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.560
 That's great.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.680
 I'd like to imagine that you can never find his actual key, because he's just going around

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.680
 and around this.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.680
 Yeah, yeah.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.680
 He's going around key rings.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.640
 Or you can never find a pen in his house.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:17.640
 Pencils everywhere.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:18.640
 Just need a pen.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:24.640
 There's a cemetery in Uruguay, which has a Jewish cemetery, and there are QR codes.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.080
 So you scan them in and you get all the information about the person and lots of details.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.920
 Or you can look at the cemetery remotely if you type in the right code for the QR code.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.880
 Oh, so it's like having an iPad gravestone?

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:36.880
 Exactly.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:37.880
 Yeah.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:38.880
 I think that's the way ahead.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:39.880
 Go for it.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:40.880
 Okay.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.320
 I love your Wikipedia page on there when you go in there, you'll like take it up with me.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.440
 It'll go on and just say, this body is a stub.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.440
 You can help me.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.440
 Yeah, expand.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.760
 With honor, it'll just be a Nokia 5510.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.840
 It'll send you a text.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:57.840
 Yeah.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:58.840
 Okay.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.120
 That's the halftime whistle there, which means it's time for our halftime show, which comes

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.800
 in the form of a QI quiz brought to you by VisitingLin.com.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.320
 So we've got three questions for this one and we're going to start with James.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.320
 Question number one.

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:12.320
 Okay.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.680
 My question is why during World War One did someone come up with the idea to build an enormous

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.680
 fake mountain in Kent?

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:19.680
 Mm.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.680
 Duh, duh, duh.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.680
 Andy.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.480
 So George is the patron saint of England now, but who was the patron saint of England before

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.480
 he was?

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.000
 Question number three, Chazinski.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 Yeah.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.360
 My question is, what is Big Ben?

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.360
 Good question.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.360
 Good question.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.360
 Okay.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.720
 There's our good questions.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.880
 If anyone wants to find out the answer to these questions, you better stay tuned to our

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.800
 show because they're coming right at the end.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.000
 But until then, we've got a match to sort out.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.800
 So it's time for the second half and we're heading over to Costa Rica.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.120
 I love this fact.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.480
 Costa Rica doesn't do proper addresses.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:58.000
 They don't have really street names or house numbers and the way you post a letter or the

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.600
 way you direct someone somewhere is just by landmarks.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:04.040
 So the postman have the worst life ever.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.800
 Every single letter is just like turn left to the post office by the edge of the street that's

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.320
 a bit dark coloured and then there's a big oak tree to the east of you.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.800
 And they do say it's hellish.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.640
 So they would have like a really massive envelope if you lived a long way, right?

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.720
 It's like turn left here and then right there and then I would have ridden you a letter,

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.440
 but there was no space after your address.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.880
 One of them said, they give me strange directions sometimes.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:31.160
 So for instance, I'll be told to walk 300 metres north and then walk back 250 metres.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.160
 It just sounds like hell.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.160
 That's great.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.360
 It sounds like they're just trying to punish their postman, doesn't it?

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.360
 Yeah.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.560
 I think they're not the only, I think Dubai and Abu Dhabi have a similar, my sister, they

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.120
 used to live in Dubai trying to send letters to her was exactly that.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:48.080
 And she said, if you got a taxi home at night, you had to direct them home like literally.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.600
 It wasn't like, bring me here, it was like, I'll show you the way.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.320
 Taxi drivers will just have the ignorance.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.320
 Yeah.

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.400
 Let's go back to Costa.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.400
 Yeah, anyway.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:01.960
 Costa Rica's first female president was called Laura Chinchilla, which is quite a nice name.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.600
 And one of the founders of the Communist Party was called Carlos Fallos.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:06.600
 Nice.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.760
 No, and their currency is the Colond.

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:09.760
 Oh yeah, it is.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:10.760
 Yeah.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.080
 Probably named after Christopher Columbus or his son, maybe.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.400
 Or his anus.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:22.320
 I really like the fact that in 1852, Costa Rica didn't have a national anthem, but they were

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.840
 being visited by UK and US diplomats.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:30.520
 And so they basically in Costa Rica went, I guess we need to get a national anthem, the commission

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.200
 to national anthem just for the visit.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.200
 And then it stuck.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.200
 Wow.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.160
 Yeah, and then they didn't add words to it until the 1900s.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:38.560
 So they didn't have time for lyrics?

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.520
 Yeah, they're like, we need a focus on one element of this right now.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.520
 We might get away with it.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.000
 Everyone just murmur our language.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.240
 They don't speak it anyway.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.240
 It's all fine.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.640
 Well, they don't have an army.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:48.640
 Costa Rica.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:49.640
 They don't know.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:56.120
 But years ago, the government in 1949, they had a civil war and then one of their leaders,

00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:01.400
 Jose Fuguerrez Ferrer, seized power to defeat an electoral fraud and then dissolved his own

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.400
 army.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.640
 But they still have a defense budget.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.680
 I think they just spent it on a military-trained police force.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:07.680
 Yeah.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.680
 Sounds a little bit like an army.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:09.680
 But yeah.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:10.680
 It's somatic.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.280
 It's crucially not quite that much.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.280
 Yeah.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:20.680
 It's work for them though, not having an army because I think it was in 2009 with 143 nations.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.160
 They're the happiest in the world.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:26.320
 The happiest nation and the greenest nations in the most eco-friendly in the world.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.120
 They have a lot of animals there, don't they?

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:35.200
 I read a fact that they have 0.03% of the planet's surface, but they are home to 500,000

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.200
 unique species.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.200
 Yeah.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.200
 Wow.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.400
 That's four percent of all known species on Earth.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.400
 That's amazing.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:46.360
 There's seven volcanoes in this tiny, tiny country, seven active volcanoes and 120 volcano

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.360
 formations.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.360
 Yeah.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.080
 Amazing butterflies, 10% of all the world's butterflies.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:54.040
 I think it may be an even higher proportion of Mars.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:58.720
 I think my all-time favourite Costa Rica fact is going to be that when an American fruit

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:03.720
 company went over there and started clearing lands to grow bananas, they found these massive

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.200
 stone balls.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.680
 No one knows what the balls were for, no one knows why they're there, but they were the

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:13.080
 things that inspired the big ball that chases Indiana Jones at the start of Raiders of the

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.080
 Lost Out.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.080
 Very cool.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.080
 They don't know why they're there.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.080
 No one knows.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.080
 That one has a mystery.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:23.400
 Okay, that's the final whistle there, but before we find out who has won today's match,

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.720
 Uruguay Costa Rica, we're going to get the answers to that visitingland.com quiz that

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.320
 we had at our halftime show.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.720
 So the answers are starting with James.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:32.720
 Okay.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:38.240
 The idea of building an enormous fake mountain in Kent was to make it tall enough to get

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.240
 the high ground against German bombers.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.680
 That would have been a big mountain.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:44.680
 Yeah.

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:45.680
 Okay.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:46.680
 Question number two was from Andy.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:51.280
 The original patron saint of England, perforced in George, was King Edward the Confessor,

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:54.760
 who was patron saint after he was king until 1066.

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.960
 So Big Ben is not a clock.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.240
 Big Ben is the name for the bell within the clock.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.240
 Ah.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:05.080
 Is it true that it was named after a big guy called Ben who was an MP?

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.080
 Is that true?

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.080
 I don't.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.080
 Ben was a complete bell.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.080
 Okay.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.080
 Well, there's the answers.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:18.000
 If you want to win any QI goody prizes, sort of like books and so on, there's an additional

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.200
 quiz that's going on visitingland.com.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:23.120
 So if you head over there, you get a chance to win some of the books.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:26.640
 All the elves are going to sign the copies of the books and there's probably more going

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:27.640
 on there as well.

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:29.880
 So now it's time to decide who's won this match.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:34.920
 I'm going to decide it today and I'm going to go for Costa Rica because I'm a massive

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:39.720
 Indiana Jones fan and I love the idea that those bulls are out there and they exist and

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.720
 they inspired it.

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:41.720
 Okay.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:42.720
 So that's it for this match.

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.280
 But join us again tomorrow where there's going to be another great battle between two

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.040
 nations and they are James.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.240
 They are France and Honduras.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.240
 France and Honduras.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.240
 Okay.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.240
 Great.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.480
 In the meantime, if you want to ask us anything about the things we were talking about in

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:57.400
 this particular podcast, you can get us all on our Twitter handles.

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:58.400
 I'm on @triberland.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.400
 Andy.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.400
 @andruhunteram.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.400
 James.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.400
 @egshaped.

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:08.000
 And I'll reply to you @quickipedia or you can also email in to elves@QI.com.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 Okay.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.120
 So we'll see you tomorrow for another match of the World Cup of Facts.
