00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.000
 Hello club fish members welcome to another piece of bonus material

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.980
 It is another compilation of outtakes from all of our shows over the last couple of months before we went on tour

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:18.180
 One quick thing before we go on with a compilation and that is that you as a club fish member

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.980
 Are eligible to join our club fish discord

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.520
 Now what is a discord a discord is a place where you can hang out chat post videos post facts

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.320
 Do all sorts of stuff and we have our very own discord

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.200
 And you can get that by going to know such thing as a fish comm forward slash fish

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.160
 Cord so go over there and you'll see loads of fish fans

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.120
 And you might also see the odd fish member dropping in from time to time to say hi anyway

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.620
 Like I said, it's a compilation time so on with the compilation

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.620
 I

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:11.020
 Was to speak everyone I

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.620
 Think it was Emily from take who said that they sold to so we'd in her diary

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:23.460
 So we don't know if she was slightly exaggerating, but I do like in a diary that they did what I guess we all do

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.240
 When you work places or when you publish books today, which is send them out to famous people desperately hoping that they'll tweet about

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.860
 They didn't sell any books, but they did write to words with Kola Ridge Tennyson, etc saying hey

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.600
 Here's our book if you wanted to mention it in your circle, I don't think any of them tweeted about it

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.340
 Robert said he did he was the poet laureate poet laureate Robert so that he wrote back to I think it was a Charlotte

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.460
 And he said literature cannot be the business of a woman's life, and it ought not to be good on him

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.460
 That's you know

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.660
 I like to see him tweet that today

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:06.900
 One animal that's struggling due to a lack of drugs is the hippos in Columbia that used to belong to Pablo Escobar

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.420
 Do you know those guys? Yeah cocaine hippo?

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.320
 Yeah, so I met Pablo Escobar used to have all these hippos and then of course

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.220
 He died and the hippos went feral and now there's a load of hippos living in Columbia

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.340
 And they can't control them and one of the reasons is they can't get enough drugs

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.980
 They can't get enough

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:33.820
 Anesthetics because they want to castrate these hippos so they can't keep mating and keep making more hippos and the

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.420
 Castration part isn't that hard

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.180
 But you need to anesthetize them first and they just can't get enough

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.620
 Anesthetics at the moment and that's one of the reasons why they're proliferating so much

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.660
 But wait, we did my previous podcast that it is hard to castrate them

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.180
 I thought because they can move their testicles around. Yeah, they does but they can't do that when they're out of it

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.860
 I see even these guys. Yeah. Yeah, I see

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.980
 Right, it's like it's easy enough to castrate a hippo the challenges in stopping it from then castrating you

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.820
 Something that's slightly surprised me, but I guess it makes sense is that Queen Victoria used to do medicinal cannabis

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.820
 We are amused and we're hungry

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:19.020
 Yeah, so the doctor so Jay Russell Reynolds

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:25.820
 He wrote that in 1890 when pure and administered carefully cannabis is one of the most valuable medicines

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.500
 We possess and it's thought that he was giving it to her in a sort of liquid form

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.780
 She wasn't sort of smoking doobies or anything like that

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.300
 But yeah, it's just quiet and bizarre

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.780
 Menstrual cramps, right? It was for menstrual cramps exactly is the is the belief

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:46.700
 Well, we said I think we did that on QI once and we said that she was she was a muggle because a muggle was someone that used

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:53.660
 Cannabis there's a really old word for someone who used cannabis and so yeah, Queen Victoria technically was a muggle

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.420
 No, I had a very small related Pablo Escobar fact after the hippos

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.980
 Which is that in the in the middle of Reykjavik there is a bar called Pablo disco bar

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.860
 Do you remember when we used to do our TV show no such thing as a news

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.020
 We would often get the boat which was down on the embankment

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.420
 I get the ferry all the way across the Thames to Greenwich and so across along along

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.060
 But actually across as well because we're going to the South Bank carry on

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.540
 Do do jump in if you have any more

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:30.460
 Points to add do you remember that when they came in they would always have the person with the lasso who had to

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.900
 I mean that's a skill

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.860
 Looping some rope round if you never sort of like dr. Canalbo for anything none of us has apart for you

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:48.660
 It is a highly skilled job and very few of you would be able to do it the first time I went on that boat by the way

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.260
 I went to the National Television Awards, which was that the

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.460
 02 yeah, but I had to wear a tuxedo

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.820
 Obviously, I don't own a tuxedo

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.460
 So I had one and I had one on the way and so I had to get on the ferry and

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.860
 Go into the toilets and change into my tuxedo on the boat going along the Thames

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.100
 They come off and I felt like James

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:15.420
 I was like well, it was the other guy who went in

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.500
 He was very slovenly looking

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.460
 Leave your clothes in the toilet to make it look like you've kind of killed in

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:30.340
 I've killed him and I'm gonna flush him down, but I'm gonna make him naked first

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:38.900
 I was I was on just on railways. Have you heard of ghost trains? Yes. Yeah

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:44.100
 Real ghost trains though true ghost trains. Yes

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.540
 I reckon dancing of a different kind of ghost

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:55.340
 I know you're talking about the empty ones. Yeah, the empty ones in the UK pretty amazing. They're not real ghost chains

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.020
 No, they're just trains that are empty. What okay?

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:04.980
 This is semantics now the point is they're empty trains and they run weird schedules and even the people in the stations don't know that they're real

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.980
 Yeah, what you can ask they can see them. Yeah, they know they're real when they see them

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:14.080
 No, no, but people at the station will frequently tell you know, there's no there's no there hasn't been a train here since

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.460
 1624

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.460
 To Aberdeen

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:23.440
 They know if there's a train coming they must do because otherwise they might stand too close to the edge and get sucked off

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:31.980
 The trains which run almost completely empty and they're very hard to buy tickets for like you get a ghost airplane rides

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.440
 flights

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.580
 That's to keep your schedule

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.020
 Two tickets to the airplane ride to New York, please

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:50.420
 Yeah, you have to explain what that's so yeah, those flights are kept those flights are kept running to keep the slots

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.460
 You know the airline has it's lots of ones keep and it's the it's a very similar thing

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:58.420
 It's basically they're a legal placeholder to stop that that line or that bit of the line being closed down

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:03.700
 Why would they make tickets hard to buy for them? No, they just don't they they don't know they exist basically so there were people

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:08.940
 We like to go on them publicized. Yeah, so they'll say I want to get two tickets to this train and they say that train doesn't exist

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:14.420
 They say I promise you it exists. Yeah, it's not on our schedule. So you can actually go on the ghost trains

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:17.460
 It's not as if yeah, they have to be empty, but it's really difficult

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:22.060
 Yeah, and it's not exciting once you're on because they aren't just a train if you're expecting a ghost on the train

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:28.180
 Of course, it's exciting to go on an empty train and the guy right the article that I read said you could cartwheel down the aisle

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:33.660
 And I didn't know that was a sort of thing that Brits wanted to do is it I once did a cartwheel

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.660
 At the BBC did you so doing a cartwheel as a yeah

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:41.020
 It's just like we're in a big sort of old room where there's a massive painting of Lord Reef

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:45.020
 And I was like I bet loads of amazing interesting things have happened here

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:48.540
 And I was the only person my wife was there as well, but there was not many others there

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:51.540
 And I thought why not I do a cartwheel she got it's gonna do his fucking car

00:07:51.540 --> 00:08:00.620
 Is this airplane ride gonna be full or empty my husband will be right down the aisle

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:06.460
 So the Mayflower had to divert the Azores the Mayflower the robot the robot robot Mayflower

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:10.300
 Okay, yeah, does that happen a lot then do you think that a lot of ships divert there?

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.400
 Is that something I only say that because there was someone who

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:18.980
 James and I were researching recently who was rowing across the Atlantic and when stuff goes wrong

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.700
 In fact, I think it's what we talked about in the podcast previously when stuff goes wrong

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.700
 They get taken to the Azores

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:27.600
 Where are they off of Morocco? Oh, okay

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:34.560
 It's like the the last place you leave before you get into Atlantic proper, right? Okay, so it's quite a useful

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:40.460
 It's quite near the middle. Yeah. Yeah, I just wonder if there's like a seaside restaurant that sort of looks at upcoming

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:44.740
 You know cross Atlantic sales and goes, okay, we could we potentially could have a big, you know

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:49.820
 500 group are coming in soon. What if the Pilgrims fathers had accidentally ended up in the Azores?

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:53.060
 Is it possible that now the Azores would be the world's super power?

00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:03.860
 Yes, I think that's the alternative history. We're all waiting for you to write. Yeah. Yeah, I found this article from

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:07.060
 2001 about someone called Jill Heinef

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:08.540
 She said I like them

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:13.740
 She said when she was deciding put new places to dive the way she does it is partly by looking at old

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:19.860
 Archival maps and comparing them to current maps and then looking at ancient writings to find out where sounds interesting

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:24.740
 So she's read back as far as Alexander the greats accounts of traveling through Egypt. I guess, you know

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:29.280
 500 years ago to go. Hey, that sounds fun. Alexander like this place

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:35.080
 She says that they found remains of Mayan sacrifices when they've been diving they found

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:40.260
 Ice age bears in Mexico extinct sloths in Cuba

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:49.100
 And actually you can study the desert by diving underwater as well. There's a place in the Bahamas called Dan's Cave

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:55.620
 It sounds pretty good doesn't it? It's 350,000 years old Dan's Cave

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:59.980
 And it contains sand that was blown there by the wind from the Sahara

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:03.620
 And there are like stalactites in there which are made out of this sand

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:07.100
 And obviously if you get some sand which is on the surface in the Sahara

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:10.420
 It might have pollution from nearby cities or something like that

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:15.380
 But if you've got it in this cave, which is 300,000 years old, then it's really pure sand from that time

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:17.180
 So it can teach you a whole lot. Oh, cool

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:23.540
 Have you guys seen Danielle Steele's table? Yes. No, she's a she writes. Is it kind of romances?

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:27.780
 Yeah, I mean they sell by the truckload. I mean, I've sold millions of millions of books

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:32.220
 Her desk is shaped like three of her own books as in it's like poops

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:45.780
 Like as it is as if she's tiny as if she's a borrower and there are these three huge books piled on top of each other

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:47.780
 And that's the desk she writes

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:53.420
 Danielle Steele's books on the spine they say Danielle Steele and then her biggest novels are on the side

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:55.420
 So is it in colour? Yeah, it's in colour

00:10:55.420 --> 00:11:02.460
 It's really incredible. Can you not get your feet under it? Yeah, you can. She uses it. It's her writing desk

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:07.180
 No, I know, but I'm imagining if you've piled up three books and they're massive. Oh, they're not real books

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:14.380
 It's like this. It's hollow on the inside. I can't believe we're having to explain so much. Are they hollow? Yes, they're hollow. It's the desk. They're not real books

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:20.860
 I thought she could perfectly simulate of the books. You could open them up and read them. Is everything in her house like a book? Yeah, it is

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:27.380
 If you need to go to the toilet, you have to lift up the front cover of one of her novels. It's incredibly confusing. It's at least a lowest selling novel

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:31.380
 She said in the toilet. The toilet paper is just sheets from every one of those books

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:36.020
 This is something about prayer paraphernalia as it were and again, it's a medieval thing

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:40.180
 It's a brilliant study by someone called Catherine Rudi of St. Andrews University

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:45.620
 who found that you can examine medieval prayer books and calculate who's been praying and

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:52.500
 Which prayers were popular and which were boring by the dirt on the pages obviously because when whenever anyone touches a page

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:58.260
 That leaves a tiny amount of organic residue on there and she used to think all the densitometer

00:11:58.260 --> 00:11:59.700
 Which I'd never heard of before

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:02.820
 Which aims light at paper and measures how much light bounces back

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:05.660
 so it's it's basically measuring the quantity of dirt and

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.580
 She found all these fascinating aspects of it from these different prayer books

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:16.300
 So when plague was huge prayer for since Sebastian anti-plague became a big thing. It seems very obvious

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:21.620
 Prayers for personal salvation were much more heavily used than prayers for the salvation of others

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:25.060
 This was another finding and she also found a prayer

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:32.020
 Which was an early morning prayer and the really interesting thing about it was that it lasted several pages in the book and the first few pages

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:36.060
 Only showed lots of dirt and the towards the end there was almost no dirt

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:40.920
 And what she thinks that shows is that people fell asleep halfway through this very early morning prayer

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:44.780
 Like you would be restarted it and then fell asleep

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:51.980
 Francis just the other day admitted that he keeps falling asleep while he's doing his prayers

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:58.540
 So everyone keeps noticing that he's just sort of his eyes are shut be slightly droopy and they think why I was really into this prayer

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:00.540
 It turns out he just admitted he's like

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.100
 And

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:07.340
 When he was sort of question that he seemed to justify it by saying Saint Teresa did it too

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:13.500
 Who was a 19th century French nun, but it sounded like he could only think of one other person to help justify

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:19.660
 He's nodding off and so on like autonomous vessels and AI and stuff

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:21.180
 In May this year

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:26.380
 We had the first ever commercial cargo ship that was navigated entirely by AI

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:30.920
 And what I mean by that is not that you've built a boat and it's deliberately AI

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:35.220
 They took an existing boat and shoved the AI in it and navigated with it

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:38.820
 And it went in Tokyo from Tokyo Bay to

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:41.580
 Somewhere near Oscar. I can't remember exactly where

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:46.500
 But it's pretty cool because in that time it had to avoid somewhere between

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:52.260
 400 and 500 vessels on that trip because it's such a busy area of water

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:57.420
 It's quite clever. That's really cool. That's incredible 500 miles is and wow

00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:03.100
 Did it do the avoiding or is it mutual avoiding both? Well, that's interesting, isn't it?

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.820
 I think it the AI did the avoiding

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:10.780
 Yeah, but it could have just plowed through and they thought well, everyone's gonna get out the way

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:13.660
 Wow, that worked really well

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:18.860
 And how does AI deal with that thing that humans have when you meet each other in a corridor on a pavement?

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:22.180
 You dodged to one side and then you dodged to the other side and we'll go back to the same side

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:25.780
 That's a problem with like Teslas and stuff. I guess right isn't it with this?

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:31.080
 Well, yeah with any kind of autonomous car you've got to work out which of you's gonna move out of the way

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:36.180
 But I guess it ships have a rule you go you go to one side always. Yeah, yeah

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:41.180
 You've been on the you've been on alba. Yeah, you always go to the same side. Sure. Do you yeah?

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:46.140
 That's the rule of the ocean for us. See that's the rule of the sea as well. There's no one side to the sea

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:53.300
 If it's ships coming towards you left and right still exist, there are those sides

00:14:53.300 --> 00:15:05.760
 What if Apollo 11 that had encountered? Yeah spaceship. Yeah an alien. Yeah, okay. Exactly. Thank you. Sorry. Yeah

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:12.900
 Amsterdam apparently has some of these autonomous boats. Oh, yeah, it's canals and they're called row boats

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:21.700
 Oh boats, so it's like robots, right, but also like rowing boats. Yeah clever, but probably potentially confusing very confusing

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:25.500
 Absolutely, they don't actually row themselves. That would be a really stupid kind of AI boat to design

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.900
 They don't know they've got a they've got a mechanical

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:32.260
 Oarsman yeah, you have to wind up at the start of the jet. Yeah, no

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:36.700
 But they're really cool because they can either be ferries so that you can sit in them and they can take you around

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:42.220
 Or they can be litter-picking boats. They've got some kind of capacity to store rubbish

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:47.340
 Or they can form into movable bridges, so they clasp on to other boats. That's really good

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:51.040
 And they just form a bridge because that's a problem with Amsterdam. There's not enough bridges

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:57.940
 Yeah, so the other boats know that they're going to be clasped onto or is it just an unsuspecting

00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:01.740
 You know sailing boats just clutched and turned into a bridge

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:06.340
 They all have to be these row boats that join each other because they're like Lego basically they stack together

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:08.340
 It can't come under it. It's not a pirate

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:14.460
 I like the idea of it being in Amsterdam you have a few drinks

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:17.560
 You're wandering around and if it looks like you're going to get towards a canal

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:21.280
 It sort of runs in the way and lets you walk along it. You're just on a bridge

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:22.800
 Yeah, yeah

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:27.960
 We could do with one of those in London's one bit of the terms in London, which I don't know why there's not a bridge along it

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:32.680
 But row boats if you're listening or maybe a massive garden bridge

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:38.380
 We need to get someone in power

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:44.640
 Do the so at the rim pack which I'm sure you know what that is

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:49.640
 It's the kind of practice war games that are held in the pacific rims pack like the Pacific rim

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:55.580
 I don't think it is named after Pacific rim dance favorite film. No the rim as in where all the volcanoes are

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:58.920
 Pacific rim and these favorite film. Thank you

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:04.120
 You've brainwashed me into that coming above the actual Pacific rim

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.240
 Pacific rim one

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:16.680
 What's James's favorite film and James hasn't seen any films

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:24.140
 It's now everything everywhere all at once

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:32.720
 In another universe it's top of my mum will shoot. So anyway, you were saying yeah Pacific rim

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:37.480
 Fights out there. So rim pack is where they do simulated military games

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:43.200
 It's like the biggest military exercise international military exercise in the world at sea and this year

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:47.880
 There's going to be an exercise which is completely formed of uncrewed robot work

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:55.720
 It's a bit Pacific rim, isn't it like the movie to have a robot boats fighting. Yeah, I don't know

00:17:55.720 --> 00:18:01.200
 All it means is large monsters coming up from a rift. I also haven't seen that film

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.660
 But I have heard Andy talk about it about billion times

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:06.380
 They are technically

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:10.740
 Because they've got two pilots. They tried it with one, but they can cope with a neural overload

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:15.980
 Well, they haven't got the monsters in these games

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:20.660
 But they're really cool the rim pack where they trial new technology and it's where I found out

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:26.500
 It's where they trialed in 2014 the leg squad support system, which is another robot

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:32.400
 Piece of military equipment, which I hadn't seen before it's also called big dog and it's basically looks like a huge

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:37.920
 Headless dog and it's for carrying military supplies in war. So it looks like a huge dog

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:42.560
 But it's like the size of a rhino or whatever and these are naval. These are no games

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:48.440
 Yeah, this I think they do stuff on land as well. Oh, sorry. Okay. I'm probably on the beach. It's a good point

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:51.520
 I think you might I think it's on the beach. Yeah, otherwise the dogs were drown

00:18:54.920 --> 00:19:00.260
 They look so fun and they just sort of like gallop across the land carrying all your soldiers bags

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:04.640
 But they never worked because it turns out they were incredibly loud. They sounded like a giant swarm of bees

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:07.820
 Any enemy would know immediately that you were coming

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:11.500
 We haven't mentioned Anne Bronte enough. I just want to say

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:16.380
 Does she just gets a raw deal give us give us some stuff. She wrote two really good books

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:19.540
 She was the her book was the first Bronte book I ever read in fact

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:25.640
 It was one of the first adult books I ever read tenant of Wildfell Hall and it's stuck with me ever since good book. Yeah. Yeah, great book

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:31.780
 Actually, I read one thing saying that she was more famous in her time than her sisters for a period anyway

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:34.840
 And some people say because by the time that she died at 29

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:39.700
 Then she was more successful than her sister. She'd published two books that had gone pretty well

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:47.320
 Well, the main thing is that Charlotte Bronte was alive when Elizabeth Gaskell was writing the book about the Bronte's

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:52.200
 She did get a chance to kind of shape the story with everyone else posthumously

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:56.420
 Suddenly it was like all of her sisters relied on everything that she did

00:19:56.420 --> 00:20:01.500
 Yeah, you know her story was the main, you know things. Yeah, I think there's a lot of that going on

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:06.780
 I don't know but also, I mean Jaina and Wuthering Heights are probably slightly better books. Uh, what? No, excuse me

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:12.920
 I think I think we can agree that if Anna thinks a book is the best book then that just means it objectively is

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:20.800
 I like it. Thank you. She must have had five typos on her gravestone. Really? That's annoying. Wow five errors

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:24.640
 And Charlotte went to she died in Scarborough, and I think she was buried in Scarborough

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:29.560
 But Charlotte went and corrected the grave. Oh, yeah, and even after like they got it got a new one

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:33.920
 They got a new one even the new one had more had another mistake on it

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:37.360
 So she died aged 28 when she was actually 29 when she died

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:42.220
 That's interesting because when you look at Wuthering Heights, sometimes you do wonder if Wuthering was just a typo, don't you?

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:46.660
 Even though everyone sort of claim now it actually does have this meaning wild and whatever

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:52.220
 Did you just mean to say Wuthering? Yeah, Wuthering Heights. It makes much more sense. I mean, what the hell is Wuthering?

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:56.420
 I've never please sign my petition to rename Wuthering Heights as Wuthering Heights

00:20:56.420 --> 00:21:00.960
 It feels like it would be a very different book, doesn't it?

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:07.400
 I was reading about a few other unusual railways. You're the Vatican has its own railway. Yes

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:14.300
 What does it do? Does it just take the Pope? Just a Pope first. It's basically it's a 600 meter long railway with very high ceilings

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:16.300
 Carriages yes

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:18.140
 Papal hat

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:22.100
 Doesn't it go so it goes from the Vatican to his to a summer house, right?

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:28.100
 Yeah, I think it's slightly confusing because I think it does link to, you know, the Roman train station whatever

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:28.860
 But I think you're right

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:34.420
 It goes it goes to the Papal summer house and you can get in fact you can now buy a ticket and go on that train

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:41.640
 Very exciting. Only four popes have ever used it. John the 23rd, John Paul II, Benedict the 16th and

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:44.120
 The Bones of Pius X

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:50.420
 Transported using the papal railway. I think the current papers not use the railway as far as I can tell

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:52.420
 Because all the plebs are using it sounds like

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:58.000
 You got the pope you don't expect to show a railway carriage with random ticket buyers

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.800
 I'll tell you what Gregory the 16th must be really fucking pissed off

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:08.920
 Does Gregory the 16th? Yeah, I don't know if you know this forbade the building of any railroads in the Papal States. Oh

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:13.100
 He hated 19th century. I guess he must have been

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:17.980
 No, he was he was early 19th century and he called railways

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:22.580
 Shimane Delfair meaning roads to hell which is a pun on

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:29.260
 Shimane Delfair meaning iron road because they're made out of iron. That is good. It's a great for a pope

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:38.240
 That's interesting. Yeah, you're right. That's the yeah. Yeah, I mean, it's not gonna win any awards at the Dave joke of the year

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.640
 Edinburgh is it? I think it might be. It's a surprise entry this year

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:43.680
 Pope Gregory is

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:53.000
 Storming it. Anyway, Pope Gregory the 16th, he saw railways as a way that liberalism might infiltrate the Papal States

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.240
 So the world was becoming more liberal and he thought if we get railways and that's just

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:04.740
 Not bloody wrong because haven't they just started allowing women into certain positions in Vatican recently?

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:09.180
 I mean, they're always built in 1929 Anna. So that's a very long road to hell

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:18.780
 The hill that's right next to the Parsonage in Howarth is called Peniston Hill

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:27.740
 Which is spelled penis stone. Yeah, and while the word pen is like an old British old

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:30.920
 Welsh word for hill there's loads of hills that have got word pen in

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:38.000
 Peniston probably doesn't get its name from that. It probably gets its name from a game called penny stone

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.920
 Well, you would get a load of stones a bit like Patonk a bit like bowls where you would try and roll your stone and get as close

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:48.720
 To another stone as possible and lots of people did it lots people would gamble on it. It's really really popular

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:54.520
 And they people were playing it for about the 15th century and they named this hill

00:23:54.720 --> 00:24:01.780
 Peniston probably around that time and the word penis didn't come into the British language till around the 17th and 18th century

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:04.760
 And so when they called it penis stone hill

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:10.300
 They didn't know that it was going to be a rude word because they thought it was just named after this gambling thing

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:15.420
 And now obviously it has one of those huge like white horse things

00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:25.740
 Is that the the pennines like pen meaning hill and meaning hell. Yeah, are there nine? No, there aren't

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:34.200
 Penine as in an adjective. This is like a pen. It's hilly penny. Just it's called hilly. Yeah

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:40.640
 Well, have you guys heard of Rob fortune? He's the main guy responsible for English tea and English tea as it is today

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:46.120
 So he was a Scottish botanist again huge start like lots and lots of Scots involved in the early tea trade basically

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:53.040
 And he's the one who stole living tea saplings from China and transported them to India like industrial espionage

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:58.300
 Exactly like that and this is from a book called for all the tea in China by Sarah Rose which looks really really good

00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:06.780
 And basically Rob fortune Robert fortune. He would go in disguise to Chinese tea factories effectively plantations of factories

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:14.100
 He had a servant called Wang who would go ahead of him Rob fortune was behind dressed as a Mandarin apparently dressed as a sort of senior official

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:20.540
 I mean if you see the what his fancy dress was and that's really what it was more than the disguise

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:24.400
 It was pretty remarkable. I believe that

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:28.400
 So I immediately pictured the fruit. I'm just gonna say

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:31.720
 So you shaved off his head

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:41.040
 And so he shaved off his hair and then he had his servant so on a pigtail that hung all the way down to his feet

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:46.060
 Yeah, he wore Chinese robes and only traveled in a sedentary

00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:50.160
 And he thought that this was enough to pass him off as a Chinese person

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:52.660
 Amazingly it clearly kind of yeah

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:57.120
 And the idea being that China is so big that it wasn't out of the question that this weird

00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:02.240
 Person with a shaved head and a fake pigtail could possibly be someone from somewhere else

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:07.320
 So his servant Wang would go ahead of him and say look, I've got a dignitary visiting from a very long

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:12.780
 Don't laugh at his pigtail. Yeah. Yeah, very sensitive about it. And will you accept a visit from this very wise official?

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:14.540
 He wants to see you know your tea factory

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:20.760
 And so he was the guy who transported the first tea saplings and he was the first westerner to realize

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:25.420
 Two things firstly that green tea and black tea are the same plant before that for a hundred years

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:27.180
 It was thought they were completely separate species

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:32.120
 Yeah, and secondly that Chinese tea makers were unwittingly poisoning their customers

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:37.400
 Because in the tea making process they included a chemical called Prussian blue

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:42.480
 Which and you know which could be poisonous, but actually it passes through the body

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:46.040
 But it does contain cyanide but that wasn't the harmful thing the harmful thing was gypsum

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:49.640
 Which was an ingredient of plaster and it was used to make the tea lovely and green

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:52.760
 But if you have it over a long period of time, it will do have

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:56.320
 Reasonably bad health effects for you. They were like cutting it with this stuff

00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:58.680
 Exactly. Yeah, and it was to try and make it a lovely green flavor

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:04.900
 It was with you know, no no harmful intent whatsoever, but that was the that was the problem with it. Yeah, Rob Fortune

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:07.300
 Wow good nominative determinism, I think

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:16.160
 Yeah, exactly. What year was he? Did you say he made the journey in 1848 and when he took the tea plants

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:19.280
 He took them in front of the podcast wadi and the cases

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:26.780
 You would really have to have a memory and I've listened to all the episodes to remember what they are

00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:28.780
 I say that's a quaint into the podcast

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:36.420
 I was looking up amazing divers. Oh, yeah, have you heard of a key out of ego?

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:43.400
 Yeah, he was a diver originally. Wow. Um, she

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:56.660
 So she is the only diver of her kind in the world she lives on an island off Sardinia

00:27:56.660 --> 00:28:02.460
 Okay. Yeah, and what she is she makes sea silk. Okay, which is incredibly rare stuff

00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:06.440
 It comes from clams secretions, right? So her job she dives down

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:09.300
 She trims the fibers which are growing out of the clams

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:13.020
 It's basically like clams have a little beard that they grow and they're made of secreted saliva

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:17.700
 So they've got this weird fibrous stuff and it turns when it hits seawater. It turns into keratin, right?

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:21.820
 She dives a hundred times to get 30 grams of strands

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:27.060
 It's incredibly labor-intensive and she weaves it once he's back up and it's dried

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:33.860
 She weaves it into this beautiful delicate linen and she no one else does it in the world. I'm not surprised

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:38.840
 Why would you look sounds completely thankless? It's three times finer than human hair, you know

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:44.940
 It's incredible and it's also family passed down. I think so she's she's and her daughter isn't sure if she wants to go into the family business

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:46.940
 So it's quite a tense time actually

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:53.020
 But her family's been doing this for 24 generations as in it goes back apparently about a thousand years

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:55.700
 This stuff is there's mention in the Old Testament this stuff

00:28:55.700 --> 00:29:09.780
 But there's a problem well, it's not a problem. It's an opportunity in many ways, which is that sea silk she can't buy or sell it

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:15.940
 That's why it's because it's according to the tradition a master of this fine linen

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:22.740
 The sea silk linen only lives on offerings. So she's on the doll. She well no she lives

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:31.900
 Offerings from visitors it can be donated or received and so people come to her and they bring her offerings also her husband's pension helps which is good

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:41.980
 Yeah, and anyway, it's just she's an absolutely incredible woman and I just wanted to give her a little shout out

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:48.700
 Yeah, if you want to give some money to someone absolutely and you may be donated a tiny bit of linen, but you may be you may not be

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:53.900
 Oh, is that right? It's not one of those things where you go and you pay what you think it's worth like an adabra chair

00:29:53.900 --> 00:30:01.860
 And you're like oh, that's a bit shit. I'll give you 20 page. She's been two dived 3,000 times to make this one doily

00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:06.340
 You might find this fact familiar

00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:12.700
 But it's that on a windy day in San Francisco Zoo strands of giraffe semen can be found floating on the breeze

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:18.380
 Yeah, I remember that fact now that yeah was posted on the QI boards by James 12 years ago

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:24.740
 So why why is it float? I actually go and collect that giraffe semen and make little dailies

00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:32.300
 And you're very concerned that your child might not want to do that

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:38.620
 You know, you can go camping underwater these days on like literally under we've all been camping in Wales

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:46.420
 No, there's a thing called the ocean space habitat which invented in 2019 and it's basically an underwater tent

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:49.980
 Okay, it's an inflatable tent you go underwater you take it with you

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:52.700
 You set it up at a strategic point and it's weighed down and ballasted

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:56.740
 So it's in the same place in the water and you can take a break in there. That's really it has windows

00:30:56.740 --> 00:31:00.340
 It has a seat. It has an oxygen source. It has a carbon dioxide scrubber

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:04.120
 But what happens when I wake up in the night and thoughtlessly unzip it to go to the

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:12.980
 I found the story about a cave diving rescue mission

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:19.740
 So this is back in 1907 and it was an Italian miner in Australia called Modesto varchetti

00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:23.540
 And he was down in this mine, which was in Bonneville in Australia

00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:29.460
 And suddenly there was this huge thunderstorm and it flooded the entire area and the entire mine flooded up

00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:34.740
 Except for one tiny pocket that he managed to find and swim up to so he was stuck there

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:36.260
 They assume that everyone was dead

00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:41.660
 So they thought we're just gonna have to just call quits here and just assume everyone who was in there is now dead

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:47.740
 But they started hearing through the ground a sort of miners Morse code this sort of very specific

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:50.380
 distress signal

00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:58.980
 And to me if you could hear that presumably that means you were probably quite close to where it was coming from

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:04.060
 So they realized someone's alive. They don't know who they tell the papers and so on

00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:08.780
 And so they enlisted two of the best divers that they knew of in the area

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:15.340
 And then someone else who was really clever and knowledgeable about mining which was President Herbert Hoover. Oh really?

00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:17.340
 Yeah, who sucks him out

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:22.300
 That was his brother Henry

00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:31.000
 So at the time he was working in Australia, this is pre-presidency and he was working for a lot of the mines

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:36.340
 Yeah, and so he had he had a lot of knowledge about it

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:40.820
 Also, they brought him in to sort of stand by and help to sort of work out what they needed

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:44.780
 Yeah, so they didn't have an air pipe long enough to go down

00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:48.100
 So they sent for the closest one which was five hundred and sixty kilometers away

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:50.780
 Well, they knew that the closest longest one was and

00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:53.460
 Australia man is just

00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:56.380
 Yeah

00:32:56.380 --> 00:33:01.220
 So far away and they they ordered and chartered a special train called the rescue special

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:03.140
 It's a 12-hour train ride

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:07.580
 But it cut two hours off the time in order to get there and then it was only on day five

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:11.740
 They couldn't fit it. They didn't have the fitting for the tap. It's annoying. It's 2,000 miles away

00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:18.180
 Day five sorry day five at this point this guy is just he's floating for five days

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:22.620
 He's just still knocking the entombed man is trying to make his point that he's there

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:25.460
 The divers go in and they start making contact with him

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:29.380
 But they can't get him out because they've only got the pipe so they can't spread the oxygen

00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:33.460
 So what they need to do is use machines to lower the water by sucking water out

00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:35.620
 So that's what they started doing, but it was taking ages

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:42.000
 So in between that these two divers kept going back in to visit him and each time they would bring cigarettes and they would smoke inside there

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:49.260
 They brought letters one from Giovanni his brother so that he could just read a letter while he was in there

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:52.900
 Yeah, and food and lamps and so on eventually they got it down and he was so

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:59.400
 Absolutely, you know tired and just wasted away from no food and drink and they managed to walk him out and he survived

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.400
 And that's one of the first major

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:12.020
 Okay, that's it that's all of our facts

00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:17.180
