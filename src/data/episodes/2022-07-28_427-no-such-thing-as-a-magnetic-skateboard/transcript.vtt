00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:19.320
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.160
 to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.760
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.280
 and James Harkin and once again we have gathered round the microphones with our four favorite

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.760
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.920
 Starting with fact number one, that is Anna.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.600
 My fact this week is that scientists have invented a 30 centimeter tall robot that could

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.240
 jump over the Statue of Liberty if it was on the moon.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.320
 If they were both on the moon?

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.000
 If they were both, yes sorry not if the Statue of Liberty was on the moon and the robot was

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.800
 on Earth, that would be incredible.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.320
 So sorry, we've moved the Statue of Liberty to the moon.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.400
 That's right yes, which I don't know why.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.560
 So aliens when they first come, the first thing they see is the moon right before they

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.440
 see the Earth unless it's on the other side.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.440
 Depends what side they're coming from.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.400
 I'm assuming they come from the moon side.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.160
 The first thing they see is liberty and lightening the world.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.360
 So we'll have to move it to the dark side of the moon, or rather the further side of

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.360
 the moon.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.560
 So we'll never see it again because the moon and the Earth are locked aren't they?

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.640
 That all the moon is tidally locked or whatever.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.040
 So we'll just never see it.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.320
 But you've seen, you know what it looks like now don't you?

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.320
 We've got pictures.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.320
 We've got pictures.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:39.240
 So this robot, which is an amazing robot, this jump, without leaping over the Statue

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.360
 of Liberty, it can leap 10 meters right?

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.800
 Yeah yeah, it can still leap quite high, it can actually leap 30 meters.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.120
 So it can leap over a 10 story building.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.760
 So it could also jump over the Statue of Christ to Redeemer in Brazil I think, I'm pretty

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.760
 sure.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.760
 And that's if it was on Earth.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.760
 And that's on Earth.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.680
 If we've got the Christ to Redeemer back from the moon, where we put it.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.960
 Right, because he always goes with the Statue of Liberty doesn't he?

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:01.960
 They're dating.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.440
 But how tall then is the Statue of Liberty?

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:10.880
 So the Statue of Liberty is 93 meters I believe, and this could jump on the moon 125 meters.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.400
 So it could actually jump the Statue of Liberty's height and then about a third as high again.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.400
 If she was giving Christ to Redeemer a piggyback.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.240
 Yes, I think that should, yeah yeah yeah, that would work.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.240
 Yeah yeah, hard to do though with the arm angles of both statues.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.240
 I'm just trying to work out how the piggyback would work architecturally.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.320
 Well he's fine, because he's up top, he's got his arms out.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.320
 Yeah, he's fine.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.440
 Do you know that the Angel of the North is actually giving Christ to Redeemer a hug?

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.360
 But they're just so far away you never see it happen.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.600
 Wow, but tectonics one day will bring them together, eventually they'll meet.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.600
 Anyway, this is a jumping robot and the scientists are very excited because it's really the highest

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.160
 robot's ever jumped, proportionally for its size, and it's quite a basic looking thing.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.080
 It's made of rubber bands and some carbon fiber slats because they store energy really

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.040
 well and it does have a motor.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.800
 Yeah, so I just wanted to say, it has a motor, does that count as a jump if you have a motor?

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:14.600
 Well, it's not using the motor to propel itself in the air, it's using its motor like we would

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.080
 use a muscle I guess to bounce a jump.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.080
 To wind up the rubber bands.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.080
 Exactly.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.160
 But maybe it counts, maybe it doesn't take it up with the researchers, I think they've

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.960
 cheated on a number of fronts here.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.920
 First of all, they put it on the moon.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.360
 But it's a robot, you're allowed to give a robot a motor, aren't you?

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.200
 Yeah, you are, they're showing off that it can jump way better than like anything in

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.200
 nature.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.200
 Showing off.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.820
 They're saying that the reason is they're saying, "Oh, my mind is better than everything

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:40.820
 in nature."

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:41.820
 In your face, Grasshopper.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:47.000
 But the reason it does it is because it has these carbon fiber slats and stuff like that.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.880
 But actually, I would argue that one of the reasons is that they're using a motor, but

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:51.880
 I don't know.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:52.880
 I agree.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.640
 But I reckon they could do it with the force of just like a human pulling it, I think really,

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.880
 or maybe they could do it with wind up.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.240
 They'd have to have some sort of force applied.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.080
 But yeah, the motor is not flying it through the air like an aeroplane, it's not just an

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.080
 aeroplane.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.080
 Right.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.560
 Also, it doesn't look like, whenever I hear robot, I think it's got two legs, two arms,

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.600
 humanoid kind of, well, not even humanoid, but you know, it's-

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.600
 C3PO.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.600
 Yeah, exactly.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.160
 Why do you not think R2-D2 is a robot then?

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.160
 Yeah, good question.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.880
 God, do you really set him a trap there?

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:25.880
 No.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.160
 That was a topical liar, wasn't it?

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:36.520
 Well, your honor, can I ask my client, actually the other person's client, does he think that

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.520
 R2-D2 is a robot?

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.320
 If you're a lawyer, James, you absolutely would do that.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.120
 You start cross-examining your own witness hot pan, just so you could use some point

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.120
 to be made.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.840
 You kind of set him up knowing that he's going to give me the wrong answer as well.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:48.840
 Sorry.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:49.840
 That's fine.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.000
 Damn it, I've had so much thinking time, I still haven't got an answer.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.880
 Yeah, it's obviously a robot, but so it's just worth saying that this one looks kind

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.520
 of like a toy for a cat, right?

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.520
 Yeah, yeah.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.920
 It's a little ball that you would play with.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.200
 Yeah, it's got two wheels at cross-angles, or maybe three, I can't remember.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.680
 Yeah, it's like two bike wheels have crashed into each other at right angles, or like the

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.960
 skeleton of a football.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.320
 Anyway, it's weird looking robot, I'll give you that.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.160
 Your Honor, I have another question.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.880
 The way it works, I should say, is that it's basically by releasing a really, really strong

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.360
 elastic force, isn't it?

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.920
 So it's got these rubber bands that are stretched really, really super far, and this makes the

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:40.000
 carbon fiber bend like an archer's bow would bend, and then when you release those elastic

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.320
 bands, then the archer's bow bends straightens, and it shoots up into the air, and it makes

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.320
 the comedy noise.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.920
 Yeah, they had to add that sound effect, it actually has quite a lot of weight.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:50.920
 It's very cool.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:51.920
 Yeah.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:52.920
 It is very cool.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.920
 Did it, was it a surprise to them how high it went the first time?

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:01.800
 I didn't even want it to jump, it just leapt out of their hands.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.520
 This is the world's best standing still rope, oh, fucking hell.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.920
 We've invented the perfect coffee table.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.480
 One of the other good things about it is that it's able to write itself when it lands, and

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.640
 so it sort of re-inflates on the ground, and then gets upright, and then jumps away again.

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:19.640
 Great.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.680
 So it keeps you on your toes, and it will be useful, apparently, this kind of technology

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:24.680
 in space.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.800
 You know, in space we've got robots and asteroids already that jump over the little lumps, and

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.880
 it could jump over big lumps.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.080
 I don't know that, more like on Mars kind of thing.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.080
 Exactly.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.920
 There's a boulder in the way, yeah.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.920
 Exactly.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.880
 I don't need to jump a hundred meters into the air.

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.080
 Could be a big boulder.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.440
 Could be a big boulder, that's true.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:50.080
 I was looking up jumping records, I got a bit distracted thinking, when do you think

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.600
 the queen last jumped?

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.280
 Has she ever jumped?

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.040
 I'm sure she did, because she's been a child, you know, she would have jumped and done skipping

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.040
 and things like that.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.760
 I've never seen her jump to my knowledge.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.080
 Is there any footage of the queen jumping?

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.080
 Does anyone know?

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.120
 If you have, send it in, and you could win £250.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:14.720
 When do you need to jump in life, when you're skipping, that's exercise, when you're exercising

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.720
 in general?

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:16.720
 Exercise in general.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.240
 If she goes on long walks, there might be a little stream that she's jumping in.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.040
 Like if a corgi gets in the way when you're walking for your purpose.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.040
 Jump the corgi.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.120
 I think that corgi's a better train than that.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.160
 Do you think that's what they say when a monarch has gone too far?

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.560
 Oh, she's really jumped the corgi now.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:37.080
 I don't know, Andy.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.080
 In fact, none of us knows.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.080
 We're just speculating.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.080
 Great question.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.520
 I think she has jumped, but I don't think for a while.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.080
 Do you know the highest jump by a horse?

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.080
 Record.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.080
 So was this Olympics?

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.080
 No, it wasn't.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.080
 It's just the record.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.440
 Although they did do the horse high jump, didn't they, in the really early Olympics.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.880
 And long jump we covered as well.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:54.880
 Yeah.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.840
 So Anna, I guess you mean the horse is allowed to run up to the thing, so it's not jumping

00:07:58.840 --> 00:07:59.960
 from a standing position.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:00.960
 No, it's not jumping from a standing position.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.040
 I bet horses can't even do that.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.520
 I bet they can't.

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.040
 Jump from a standing position.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.040
 Yeah.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.040
 They can jump from a standing position.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.040
 They've got muscles in their legs.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.040
 The queen can do it.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.560
 Can she do it on a horse though?

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:12.720
 Because she rides a lot, doesn't she?

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.040
 She can't jump the horse.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.600
 Can the queen jump over a horse from a standing position?

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:22.800
 I think I've seen that happen at like badminton and stuff where they have like multiple fences

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.400
 to go over and they'll stop from one to the other, I think.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.400
 They definitely do that.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.400
 I mean, I've seen horses do it as well.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.200
 I think they're quite better at it than we are.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.200
 I think you're right.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:35.120
 I'm thinking of a horse standing with all its legs straight, but you're allowed to bend

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.120
 your legs before you jump.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.120
 Yeah.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.120
 It can't fire itself up.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:44.400
 I actually don't think you can jump without a tiny bit of bending of any muscles.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.800
 You think you can, but now when you think about it, you're like, actually, I am moving

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.680
 my ankles a bit if I do that, sort of, if I do that pencil jump.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:52.680
 Yeah.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:53.680
 Yeah.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:57.480
 But it wasn't a pencil jump, just a normal horse jump.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.200
 I think it's, I remember a fact.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.080
 I think it's shorter than the human high jump.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:06.320
 It's actually not that much higher than it, but it is a bit higher and it's beat everyone

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.000
 else by quite a long way or the other horses.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.040
 So it's eight foot one inch and the record was set in 1949 and it's never been broken.

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.040
 Wow.

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.040
 Really?

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:19.520
 And it was set by this really, this cool horse called Hwasso and Hwasso.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:20.520
 Hwasso.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.520
 Hwasso.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.520
 Hwasso.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:23.520
 Oh my God.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:24.520
 It's called Hwasso.

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.160
 Well, it was a horse in Chile.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.160
 And I guess Hwasso was the Chilean for horse in the 40s.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.080
 Oh my Hwasso.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.840
 My kingdom for a Hwasso.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.920
 It came from New York to Chile.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:44.080
 Anyway, it was really bad at everything else and it was almost retired.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:48.040
 In fact, I think it was almost put down because it failed at racing, at dressage, at show

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.320
 jumping because it was very hard to control.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.280
 And then an army officer was wandering by its field one day and saw it jump over a fence

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:57.760
 and thought, my God, that's high and bought the horse on the spot.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:01.640
 And they trained it up specifically just to break the world horse high jump record.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:02.640
 Cool.

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:06.940
 And it did it and it broke the record when it was 16 and the moment it broke it, it retired.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:08.120
 And it was never written again.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.120
 Wow.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.120
 Really good.

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.120
 Isn't that nice?

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.120
 One moment of glory in its life.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.120
 Yeah.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.120
 And I went to quit.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.440
 It retired or it was retired?

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:18.760
 It made the decision, it signed the forms with little hoof prints.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:24.640
 They put it into a field with very high fences.

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:25.960
 Some stuff on robots, maybe?

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:26.960
 Oh, yeah.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:31.880
 One thing that's really hard for robots to do is handle soft fruit.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.640
 But there is a - what?

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:38.680
 Because they don't need to eat fruit, I suppose, so I can't imagine it being a problem.

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:39.680
 They haven't needed to learn.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:40.680
 Yeah.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:43.560
 But what if you want a robot to prepare you some fruit?

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:44.560
 That's a good point.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.560
 That's a good point.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.560
 And I do.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:47.840
 The problem is that fruit is uneven in shape, right?

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.680
 So even if you have two apples, they might not be exactly the same.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.920
 Two bananas might not be exactly the same.

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:56.960
 But there's a guy called Hichiyo Kim at the University of Tokyo and he and his colleagues

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:02.840
 have developed a machine learning robot that has learned how to peel a banana.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:09.160
 So it took 811 minutes of data that it had to watch to learn how to do this banana.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:14.320
 The task was divided into nine stages, like first of all grasping the banana, then picking

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.080
 it up off the table, blah, blah, blah.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.080
 Okay.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:22.880
 So they have this robot that can successfully peel a banana 57% of the time.

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:30.400
 I'm not going to stop my holiday beach bar with it.

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.720
 It took ages as well.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.320
 There's three minutes.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.320
 Three minutes.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:40.840
 The queue is building up at Robo's beach bar for the banana smoothies.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:54.200
 I was reading about you can get these new robot smart suitcases, which, oh, it just

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.200
 looks so cool.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.200
 So what do they do?

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.200
 It just follows you.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:00.320
 So like, let's imagine you're in the airport and you're just walking to your plane.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.560
 It's just coming up next to you beside you.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:03.960
 Is it with a magnet or something?

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:07.480
 Because I've often thought you could get a great, like if you have the right magnet.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.480
 No.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.480
 No.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:10.480
 No, it's not.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:14.520
 It's more likely radio waves coming from your phone and it just follows the waves.

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:15.520
 Exactly.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:16.520
 That would be another way of doing it, Bob.

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:17.520
 Yeah.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:18.520
 I feel a great big magnet.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.920
 Walking through security in the airport with a massive magnet.

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.800
 Yeah, I can see that working.

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.800
 And also everyone else has the same luggage as you, right?

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.120
 That's one problem.

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:35.120
 Everyone's just attracted to your massive magnet and you're just walking around Heathrow

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:38.880
 with a hundred bags attached to you.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:39.880
 It's not feasible, Andy.

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:43.000
 It's like a beekeeper for suitcases.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.360
 A beard of suitcases.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:53.080
 Yeah, there are some teething troubles, Murrow's magnet suitcase, yeah.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:58.160
 But yeah, so no, it's also got facial, so it is a phone and there's facial recognition

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:02.480
 and the facial recognition, that does mean if someone like Andy tries to run off with

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:06.200
 your suitcase, it's got an alarm system that says, "No, no."

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.680
 Oh, that's clever.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:08.680
 Does it scream?

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:13.520
 No, Mr Murray, no, please.

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:14.520
 That's really clever.

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:15.520
 Yeah, thank you.

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:16.520
 That's great.

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.600
 So, sorry, how does it, I can't remember now how it works.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.600
 It follows you around.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.400
 Yeah, so you've got, I guess you'll have an app on your phone and it's in its facial

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.400
 recognition.

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:24.400
 Is this a thing?

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:25.400
 What force?

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.400
 Oh.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:27.400
 Sorry.

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:28.400
 What is it using?

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.400
 It uses a motor.

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.400
 Cheating.

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:31.400
 Cheating with a motor.

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:32.400
 It's one of the cheating robots.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:33.400
 Cheating with a motor.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.920
 So, it's like remote controlled only, instead of using a remote control, it's just following

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:36.920
 your phone.

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:37.920
 Yeah.

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:41.040
 But was there not a guy, when we were in New York and we were walking down the street,

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:47.800
 was there not a guy on a motorised, what's it called, skateboard who fell off his skateboard

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:52.240
 and then his skateboard was like five metres away from him and he pressed a button on his

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.640
 phone and it kind of followed and came up to him.

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:55.640
 Wow.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:56.640
 Do you remember that?

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:57.640
 I didn't see that.

00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:58.640
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we were walking along the street and he came up, he looked like

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.240
 a bit of a chump, he fell off his skateboard.

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:03.000
 But then he summoned it like a dog and it was cool.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 Are you sure?

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.640
 Because I remember the guy coming off, but I don't remember the skateboard return.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:07.640
 I do remember that.

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:08.640
 That did happen.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:09.640
 Wow.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:10.640
 Same technology, or a magnet.

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:11.640
 Or a magnet.

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:18.640
 He wouldn't have fallen off at all, with a magnet in place.

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:26.200
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:31.680
 Okay, my fact this week is that the last ever speaker of the bow language of the Andaman

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:40.000
 Islands would only speak it to birds who she considered to be her ancestors.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.680
 So you might remember a few weeks ago we talked about the Andaman Islands, about elephants

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.360
 swimming among them.

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:49.960
 I did a lot of research about the Andaman Islands themselves, but we never used it,

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.400
 so here we are again.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:56.400
 This is recycling, Greta would be proud.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:01.360
 This is the Andaman Islands, as we said before, they are between just off the coast of India

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:08.040
 and it is an article that I read on BBC online about Professor Anvita Abbey who has written

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:14.240
 the first dictionary of this language and she talked about this last speaker who was

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:19.720
 called Boa Senior and she said that, you know, I spoke to this person, got all the words,

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.040
 blah, blah, blah.

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:25.200
 But whenever this woman- Did she have to dress as a bird?

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:33.640
 Well, she said Professor Anvita Abbey, she said they caught this woman speaking it to

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:36.920
 the birds and when they asked her about it, why are you speaking it to a bird?

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:40.840
 They said, well, they are ancestors and they are the only ones who understand my language

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:43.360
 besides yourself.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:44.360
 And yeah, this is- Wow.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.360
 That's very sad.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.360
 Yeah.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:50.040
 If she dressed as a bird, she would have been a feathered bird.

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.040
 Oh, brilliant.

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:56.320
 So she could have done that but it probably wouldn't work in her language.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.160
 That was the tragedy.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.160
 It is.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:03.320
 She spent 30 years as the only person speaking it.

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:04.320
 Such a long time.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.320
 It is a long time.

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:10.260
 She obviously knew other variations of Hindi that she also spoke on the islands.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.120
 She could talk to other people in some ways.

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:19.280
 She was quite spry, so she died in 2010 and she was in her mid-80s, I think.

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:24.240
 But when the Indian Ocean tsunami came in 2004, was it, I think?

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.240
 Yes.

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:26.240
 Yes.

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.720
 She was 79 years old and she had to climb up a tree to escape it.

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:29.720
 Yeah.

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.720
 A tree.

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:31.720
 Yeah.

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.920
 Maybe she asked the birds to lift her up into the branches of the tree.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:34.920
 It's very possible.

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:39.200
 Maybe she has a little motorised little thing in her ankle and was lobbed up into the tree.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:46.000
 It was really interesting about that because her group used really old knowledge to see

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.400
 that there was a tsunami coming.

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:52.440
 So it's the Angay tribe that she was part of.

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:56.400
 They used knowledge by the type of fish that are found at different levels of seawater.

00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:00.080
 So when the sea really went out, there were different fish that they could see and they

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:02.680
 could see that there was a problem, so they went to high ground.

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:03.680
 What?

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:07.480
 There was another group called the Ajarawas who were in the Andaman Islands and they saw

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:12.080
 the patterns of the waves changing and they had this ancient knowledge that knew that

00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:15.560
 there was something that was a problem coming and so they could get away.

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:21.560
 The Andamanese, they're much more sort of integrated into Indian society now and they

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:26.240
 were the slowest to react to this tsunami because they didn't have all of the ancient

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.240
 knowledge.

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:28.240
 Yeah.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:30.320
 But that is, it's weird you mentioned that because that's one of the things about where

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:33.420
 languages is the fear that that kind of knowledge will get lost.

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:36.240
 In rural communities, there's so much kind of knowledge that we don't know yet.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:40.720
 I was listening to a really interesting podcast, I think it was the Guardian Science podcast

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:45.400
 and it was about how we're losing medicinal plant knowledge because of all these languages

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:46.400
 that are disappearing.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:50.680
 So it was someone saying that like every botanist, even however much they know, they'll go into

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:54.760
 the forest and immediately they'll go, "Shit, I only know about 1% of these plants."

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:58.840
 And yet the local people who live in the Amazon or in Guinea or whatever will know all of them

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:01.560
 and will know like what they can be used for.

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:07.100
 And this guy did a study in the Amazon, North America, and New Guinea and he made a list

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:10.520
 of 12,500 plant purpose pairings.

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:14.760
 My God, it must have taken a long time, but it was, so that's like a plant and then the

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.080
 purpose that it's useful, pairings.

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:21.360
 And he said 75% of them were specific to one language, so they're not shared by any other

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:25.840
 language and most of those languages are endangered languages.

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:26.840
 So all of that knowledge would go.

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:27.840
 Do they work?

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.840
 Sorry, do these 12,500 work?

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:30.840
 He didn't specify that.

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:31.840
 He gave examples.

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:36.400
 Like Doc leaves on a nettle stick, the only one I know and it doesn't work.

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.400
 But you know aspirin, that comes from that.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:43.360
 I know how to go into a shop and ask for cow pole, you know.

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:47.740
 Most importantly, it feels like we need to teach people how to do that.

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:52.120
 There's an explorer called Wade Davis who's been pushing this for many, many years.

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:53.520
 We've mentioned him on the podcast before.

00:18:53.520 --> 00:19:02.240
 He's the one who claimed that poo knife was made by Frosty Poo Knife.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:15.440
 So Wade Davis says that and he says this in his talks that he thinks that what our sort

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:19.200
 of period of time is going to be known for is it's going to be obviously the destruction

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:23.200
 of the environment, but he thinks the ethnosphere is the biggest thing that we've not noticed

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:27.800
 that we've decimated all the languages of the world are becoming extinct because we

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:28.800
 keep spreading out.

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:30.520
 We keep saying English is a great language.

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:34.360
 Why don't you learn that or French and we lose their languages and all the knowledge

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.360
 goes with it.

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:40.000
 7,000 languages in the world and 2,000 are endangered as in less than a thousand people

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 speak them.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 I think.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 It's sad.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.800
 They're going extinct every day, aren't they?

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:46.200
 A couple of recent ones.

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:52.400
 If you search on Google News for like extinct last speaker of, you know, there's loads in

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.360
 the last couple of years alone.

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:55.360
 Really?

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.360
 Yeah.

00:19:56.360 --> 00:20:02.880
 So the next, the Yagan language, the Yagan language, the Yagan language, the Yakan language,

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:10.280
 the Yamana language, Hausi Kuta, Yagan Kuta, Tekwinitsa and Yapu languages, all on the

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:18.760
 same day because they're all different words for the same language.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:21.200
 This was in Chile.

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.360
 This is a woman called Christina Calderon.

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:29.720
 She was the last speaker of what we would mostly know as Yagan and Yagan language is

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:35.640
 most famous among people like us who do this kind of research for a word which is Mami

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:41.720
 Lapinatapai, which got the Guinness World Record in 1993 for being the world's most

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:44.400
 succinct word.

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:49.040
 And it means the unspoken but meaningful glance shared between two people during a private

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:54.200
 moment where both individuals know the other, understands what is being expressed.

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.160
 And say again what it is.

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:57.660
 Mami Lapinatapai.

00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:58.660
 Okay.

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:01.560
 It's quite succinct.

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:02.560
 Yep.

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:04.160
 I could, I could create a shorter word.

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.160
 Could you?

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.160
 But...

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:10.200
 Ah, we all know what you mean.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:13.000
 I read a really interesting piece about this Aussie island.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 It's called South Gulburn Island.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.600
 I've never heard of it before.

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.520
 It's off the coast because it's an island, obviously.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:18.520
 Which coast?

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:19.520
 The Australian coast.

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:20.520
 And there are only...

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:21.520
 It's only one, Dan.

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:22.520
 Yeah.

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:23.520
 Yeah.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:24.520
 Yeah.

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:25.520
 It goes all the way around.

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:26.520
 It goes all the way around.

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:27.520
 Sorry.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.520
 My bad.

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:29.520
 My bad.

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:30.520
 Bloody hell.

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:31.520
 Ask a stupid question, mate.

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.520
 There are 500 people there.

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:40.120
 This was a piece in the Atlantic, by the way, which confusingly is not a relevant notion,

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:41.120
 yes.

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:42.120
 But there are 500 people there.

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:45.200
 They live in a settlement called Warui Community.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:48.680
 And between these 500 people, they speak nine languages, right?

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:49.680
 Mm-hmm.

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:53.640
 Now, the really weird thing is that they haven't developed a mutual pigeon, you know, a kind

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:57.800
 of mash-up language where everyone knows that one, and they don't speak each other's

00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:58.800
 languages.

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.560
 But there are only 500 of them.

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:02.480
 You know, you can't only speak to people who know your language.

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:06.720
 So the way they get along with each other is, they all speak their own languages, and everyone

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:11.160
 else just understands enough of the language the other guy is speaking.

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.160
 No way.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:16.640
 Well, effectively, they are like British people on holiday who just use their own language

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.360
 and trust that it will be understood.

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:19.360
 Yes.

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:20.360
 Oh, wow.

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:21.360
 Do they shout really loudly?

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.360
 Yes.

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:24.640
 And say it really slowly, and in a slightly racist accent?

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:25.640
 They want two beers.

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:26.640
 That's what they want.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:27.640
 No.

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:28.640
 And they have multi-lingual conversations.

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:30.640
 So you walk past two people having a chat about something.

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:31.640
 That's interesting.

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:34.120
 One will say something in their own language, the other will reply in a completely different

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:35.120
 language.

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:36.120
 Wow.

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:37.120
 Weird.

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:38.120
 That's unbelievably confusing.

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:39.120
 Yeah.

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:40.120
 God.

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:41.120
 Well, hey, here's a cool species from the Andaman Islands.

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:42.120
 Yeah.

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:49.040
 It's a dabularia jala kenyakai, and it's 10 centimetres tall.

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:51.480
 It's an algae, and it's made of one cell.

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:52.480
 Wow.

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:53.480
 One cell.

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:54.480
 Wow.

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:57.560
 Because we've done the largest single-celled creature, and I feel like it's not that much

00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:58.560
 bigger than that.

00:22:58.560 --> 00:22:59.560
 That's amazing.

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:00.560
 No, I don't think it is.

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:01.560
 It's got one nucleus.

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:02.560
 It's really weird.

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:03.560
 It looks quite complicated.

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:05.480
 It's got roots and a stalk and a cap and all this stuff, and it's just one celled.

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:06.880
 I find those so weird.

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.440
 And how high can it jump?

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:11.480
 It's the same as the queen.

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:12.480
 Yeah.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.480
 Exactly.

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:14.480
 It doesn't.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:17.480
 Can I tell you about one more language which died this year?

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:18.480
 Yeah.

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:22.740
 So this was Gaelic in the Braze of Lecarba.

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:27.440
 It's a vernacular from this area of Scotland, and it was due to the death of Ronnie the

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:31.800
 Crofter who died aged 90 this year.

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:35.360
 He was well-known in the Crofting community and the Drowing community.

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:36.880
 Do you remember we talked about those?

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:37.880
 Yeah.

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:38.880
 He was a bit of a drover.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:44.160
 And his mother came from a family of farmers called the McDonald's.

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.160
 The McDonald's.

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:46.160
 Not the McDonald's.

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.160
 Well, the McDonald's.

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:48.160
 Then there's got his McDonald's.

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:49.160
 The Scottish McDonald's.

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:50.800
 Not the chain McDonald's.

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:54.520
 No, and not from the old McDonald's had a farm story.

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:56.560
 Farming dynasty.

00:23:56.560 --> 00:24:01.640
 From the Scottish McDonald's, and his father was a Campbell.

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:06.800
 Okay, so the Campbell's and the McDonald's, bit of a tough time, but since the massacre

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:12.800
 of Glencoe between those two families, and so he had to find an explanation for his family,

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:19.920
 and he found an ancestor who had been a piper for both the Campbell's and the McDonald's,

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.280
 who was one of his ancestors.

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:25.120
 And so actually he could say, well, you know, we were together back then and we're together

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:26.120
 again now.

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:27.120
 That's very nice.

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:31.160
 And apparently, and this was in the article in the BBC, they said that the piper's in

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:35.800
 those days were so important in the clan system that a really good one would transfer

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:39.760
 between clans, like a modern footballer would transfer between football teams.

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:40.760
 Amazing.

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:41.760
 Isn't that incredible?

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:42.760
 So cool.

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:45.600
 Having listened to enough bankpipes in my time, I think they were thrusting them on

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:46.600
 each other.

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:47.600
 You take it, honestly.

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.080
 Sorry, was he called Ronny the Crofter?

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:51.080
 Ronny the Crofter, yeah.

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:54.360
 We're saying he was called Ronald McDonald.

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:58.160
 Did he raise cows?

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:05.000
 It doesn't say what his actual surname was, but it perhaps he was a cowboy.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.160
 But he had two uncles who are archbishops of Glasgow.

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:15.120
 His grandmother was a close relation to Saint Murray McKillop, who was the first Australian

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:16.120
 saint.

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:17.200
 He was a shinty champion.

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.400
 He was a champion she-ra.

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:24.040
 He never married, but he said those who were desirable were not available and those who

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:26.160
 were available were not desirable.

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:27.160
 E.I.

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:41.240
 O.K., it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:45.160
 My fact is that The Rolling Stones' latest tour was sponsored by a retirement planning

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.160
 organisation.

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:49.720
 They're so, so old now.

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:55.040
 Surely the main audience of The Rolling Stones is, I'm sorry to say, too late to be planning

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:56.040
 their retirement.

00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:57.040
 You're right.

00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:59.040
 God, that's a good point.

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:03.200
 You know, when you watch daytime TV and all the adverts are like, "Don't forget your

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:08.240
 will, guys," or, you know, "This donkey sanctuary would really be helped if you left

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.240
 it some money."

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:12.960
 It's basically like a big version of that, but in Wembley Stadium or wherever it is.

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.400
 So this is their most recent tour.

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:17.040
 So there's a group called The Alliance for Lifetime Income.

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:20.760
 It basically is a non-profit and it's formed to raise awareness about the need to protect

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:26.520
 your income in retirement by getting an annuity.

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:28.960
 They actually, I really like this detail.

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:32.760
 So they, you know, sponsored the whole thing because The Rolling Stones' audience had lots

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:37.520
 of fans who were up to the age of 75, many who were over, but they thought this is perfect

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:42.520
 to spread their message and they sent along a bus to the events where you could get your

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:46.840
 retirement income security evaluation showing how well you'd be covered in retirement at

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:47.840
 the gig.

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:48.840
 That's great.

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:50.720
 I mean, I love it.

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:56.800
 So this was the no-filter tour, it's called, and it's pretty amazing to see how much money

00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:58.400
 the Stones are still generating.

00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:02.840
 There's a big list of like most successful tours of all time and this tour is in the

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:03.840
 top 10.

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:04.840
 Really?

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:07.080
 This late in their career is in the top 10.

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:10.360
 So they don't need to worry too much, really, about their own retirement savings, given

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:13.280
 that they're all about 95 and they're still working.

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:15.280
 Multi-hundred millionaires, yeah.

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:18.680
 And who haven't paid any tax on any of their earnings for the last 30 years?

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:23.800
 Oh, look, they moved to France for a very good reason in the 70s, rates were very high.

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:27.200
 The Stones have always done this sort of corporate sponsorship commercial stuff, like way ahead

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:33.840
 of other bands and things like this, so in 2003 they were sponsored by T-Mobile, in 1981

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:38.440
 they were sponsored by Joven Musk, which was a fragrance firm, and like way, like way, way

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:39.440
 back.

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:43.320
 Well, didn't they start out doing a jingle for Rice Krispies as well?

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.360
 They didn't start out doing that, but they did it very early on.

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:46.360
 Very early on there.

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:47.360
 It was like in 1964.

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:50.400
 The first gig was in 1962, and then quite a, so yeah.

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:54.240
 Because Mick Jagger went to London School of Economics, didn't he?

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.240
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.240
 So yeah, he was quite...

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:59.260
 And did finance and accounting, I think, something did a module in it, and did pretty

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:02.960
 badly and didn't do any work, but clearly picked up something.

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:03.960
 Yeah, yeah.

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:08.600
 His tutor said in the first year he got straight Cs in all of his subjects because he wasn't

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:10.240
 really paying that much attention.

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:14.080
 But the next year he did come back and do his resets and like went to the library and

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:18.960
 properly studied and stuff like that, because it was only when they got the first contract

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:21.760
 to record a first single that he completely gave it up.

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:25.000
 He still kind of thought he might go into finance at that stage.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 God, that's interesting.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.200
 So he kind of moved from Class C to Class A is what you're saying, which mirrors the

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:32.000
 other journey they went on as well.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.320
 There was quite a nice interview with the guy who was their accountant back then, guy

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:37.840
 called Lawrence Myers.

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:40.800
 And he said he remembered talking to Mick Jagger when they were in their 20s, and Mick

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:44.480
 Jagger being really worried then about getting a pension and saying, you know, I need to

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:47.080
 start saving for my retirement, because who knows where I'll be.

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:49.920
 And he said he remembers a phrase Mick Jagger saying, I'm not exactly going to be playing

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:51.440
 rock and roll in my 60s, am I?

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:55.320
 And then finding it the most hilarious idea that he would be.

00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:56.480
 And the man is now 78.

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:57.480
 Yeah.

00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:58.480
 They're so old.

00:28:58.480 --> 00:28:59.480
 They're so...

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:02.360
 I mean, the three surviving key ones, I think there are about 200 between them.

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:03.360
 No, more than...

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:04.360
 Really?

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:05.360
 Are they?

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:06.360
 Right.

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:07.360
 Mick and Keith are both nearly 80.

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:08.360
 Yeah.

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:10.360
 And Ronnie Wood, who's the new boy, because he's only been on the band for 40 years.

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:12.920
 He's never quite fit in.

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:13.920
 Basically, yeah.

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:16.800
 I mean, they have this combination of being obviously quite cool, greatest rock and roll

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:19.240
 band in the world, blah, blah, blah, and powerfully naff.

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:20.240
 Yes.

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:23.160
 There are so many incredibly boring things about them.

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:29.280
 So, for example, Charlie Watts, their drummer who died a year ago, he was incredibly dull

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:30.440
 in multiple different ways.

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:32.080
 Like, he made a study of it.

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:34.720
 He wasn't really interested in rock and roll music, for one thing.

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:37.560
 He liked jazz, and he had his own jazz band and, you know, did that.

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:39.720
 He wasn't necessarily dull, if you like jazz.

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:40.720
 Very good point.

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:41.720
 Very good point.

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:42.720
 Sorry.

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:43.720
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:44.720
 Okay, okay.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:45.720
 All right.

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:46.720
 That's just a warmer.

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:47.720
 That's the start of the day.

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:48.720
 When they went on tour, what's the classic thing a rock band will do to their hotel room?

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:49.720
 Throw TVs out of the window.

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:50.720
 Absolutely.

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:51.720
 Tear it up.

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:52.720
 Yeah.

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.000
 He would draw his room on tour.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.040
 He would produce an accurate drawing of every single room he stayed on on tour for

00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:59.120
 about 50 years.

00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:01.320
 I think it was specifically the beds.

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:05.800
 He was obsessed with the beds of every hotel room that he stayed in, and he said that basically

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:11.280
 up until his death, he's had like 15 journals worth of, you know, they did like 2,000 gigs.

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:15.440
 He did every single bed, and he felt like if he didn't draw the bed, something was

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:17.960
 a skew in his life, and it just, it was out of whack.

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.840
 Once you've seen one bed, I feel like you've seen them all.

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:24.440
 Well, he would agree, because he said, "I have all these hotel rooms recorded."

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:27.760
 He did all the hotel rooms, but he definitely did the bed every time, but he would often

00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:28.760
 do the whole lodgings.

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:33.160
 But he said, "You've got Washington in '67, and then you got Washington from a couple

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:35.520
 of years ago, and they're kind of the same."

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:41.040
 I was reading a piece about it, and it said, "The 15 notebooks full of drawings of beds

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.040
 by Charlie Watts."

00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:45.160
 And the person who was writing the article said, "I mean, are there any publishers reading

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:46.160
 this?

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:47.160
 We've got to get these printed."

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:48.160
 Oh my God.

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:49.160
 No, you don't.

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:50.160
 Come on, they'd say like wildfire.

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.520
 Here's what I want to know, though, and I couldn't find this out.

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:53.520
 He passed away in hospital.

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:54.520
 Yeah.

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:55.520
 In a bed.

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:56.520
 Oh, stop.

00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:57.520
 I bet he didn't have time to draw the bed.

00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:58.520
 I just want to know, did he draw the final bed?

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:00.120
 Do we have the final Charlie Watts bed?

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:02.320
 I hope somebody did, if he didn't.

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:07.600
 With him finally in it, Charlie Watts finally lying in his bed.

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:10.920
 I like to think, I hope he did trash the rooms afterwards because I like to think he'd trash

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:12.160
 the room completely.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:14.960
 And then, as he's checking out, he went, "I've trashed the room, but here's exactly

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:18.640
 what it looked like."

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:22.200
 So another thing of Charlie Watts is that he used to have all these amazing cars.

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.200
 It was a hobby.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:26.920
 He would collect all these cars, really expensive, but he didn't have a driver's license.

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:30.160
 So they just used to sit in his garage, but what he used to do is he would commission

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:34.440
 a suit that matched the car in its color.

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:39.760
 And he would just go sit in his garage, in his suit, in the car, and just go, "Broom."

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:41.920
 And just play with it for a bit.

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:44.720
 And that's what you do with all your tax-avoided money, isn't it?

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:48.000
 Why is there a car you can't drive?

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 He didn't like the drums even, or he didn't like practicing the drums, and in fact, just

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 didn't do it.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.480
 There's quite a charming interview with him where he was asked if he ever practiced himself

00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:00.440
 on the drums, and he was like, "God, no, I'd never practiced the drums.

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:02.760
 Playing the drums is so bloody boring."

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:04.320
 And he said, "It's really dull playing the drums.

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:05.320
 He's scared of the drums.

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:06.320
 He thinks they're too loud.

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:07.320
 He's scared of the drums."

00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:10.600
 His life reads like a tragedy, really.

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:15.600
 You know, you become incredibly famous and successful doing something you fear and hate.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:20.400
 Imagine that every time he was like, "Boom."

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:23.160
 He started life as a banjo player.

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:27.720
 He was given a banjo to play.

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:28.720
 Has anyone tried to play a banjo?

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:33.320
 By the way, it was really, really hard to play banjo, and he found it also hard.

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:38.120
 He couldn't work out the fingerings, and so he kind of broke up his banjo, and with his

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:43.160
 broken banjo and a Meccano set, he made his first drum kit, which is how he learned the

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:44.160
 drums.

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:45.160
 Oh, wow.

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:48.040
 That's quite cool, because on quite a few of the big Stones tracks, he plays a kid's

00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:50.480
 drum instead of using actual drums.

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:51.480
 I can't remember which.

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:52.480
 Yeah, the massive tracks.

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:53.480
 I can't remember the names of them.

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:56.800
 That's cool, because he said the only way he ever did practice was playing with heavy

00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:58.280
 sticks just on his legs.

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:01.000
 So maybe he loved playing drums that aren't real drums.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.920
 Sorry, he beat himself on the legs.

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:04.840
 Yeah, he can't walk now, actually.

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:05.840
 Don't do this.

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:06.840
 He's so scared of drums.

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:07.920
 He definitely can't walk now.

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:11.200
 He can't walk now.

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:16.080
 My landlord used to be Mick Jagger's old flatmate, and it's just, there is a bit of

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:21.280
 a celeb connection, which is that my landlord is Tim Henman's dad.

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:26.360
 So, Tim Henman's dad and Mick Jagger used to live with each other in Richmond, I think

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:27.360
 it was.

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:31.280
 The stories they must have had to say to each other, Tim Henman, I guess, wasn't born

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:32.280
 at the time.

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:33.280
 No.

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:34.280
 No.

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:35.280
 But I bet they still found a lot to talk about.

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:36.280
 Absolutely.

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:37.280
 Yeah.

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:38.280
 That's not the most.

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:39.280
 That is very...

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:40.280
 What?

00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:41.280
 Your old landlord.

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:42.280
 Your old landlord.

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:43.280
 Was Tim Henman's dad as well?

00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:45.280
 I can't believe I didn't know that.

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:46.280
 That's...

00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:47.280
 You've been holding that fact out for the last eight years.

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:48.280
 I think you've told us that before.

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:49.280
 I think I have.

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:50.280
 Yeah.

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:53.080
 I think I must have found it too exciting and deliberately forgotten it because I wouldn't

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:54.800
 have been able to look it down the same way again.

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:58.760
 I'm actually shaking a bit, just being on the same room as a guy who once paid rent

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:02.080
 to the father of former British number one, Tim Henman.

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:05.040
 I'm shaking a bit, but the bit that's shaking is my head.

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:07.680
 That's a true story.

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:11.040
 There used to be a very huge thing in bands about eating on stage.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:14.840
 So during the Rolling Stones' first ever gig, Ian Stewart is kind of the sixth member of

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:17.520
 the Rolling Stones, but he's never been one of the front line-up, but he played with them

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:18.720
 decades and decades.

00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:22.760
 At their first gig in 1962, which was in a club on Oxford Street, he was playing the

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:25.920
 piano with one hand and eating a pork pie with the other.

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:29.120
 It's not a very complex piano part, is it, if you can do the pork pie with the other hand?

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:31.920
 You know when you play chopsticks and two of you can play at the same time.

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:35.480
 Oh, you think he had someone else's hand, someone else was eating a prawn sandwich whilst

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:37.040
 playing the left hand.

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.040
 Interesting.

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:41.560
 Actually, there was quite a lot of do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:42.560
 Single-handed piano going on.

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:43.560
 Well, there you go.

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:44.560
 Must be the pork pie in the other.

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:48.680
 But the Beatles used to eat jam sandwiches on stage.

00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:52.200
 And then their manager, Brian Epstein, told them, "You have to stop eating jam sandwiches

00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:53.200
 on stage."

00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:54.200
 Was that in Berlin?

00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:55.200
 Sorry, in Hamburg.

00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:56.200
 That's pre-that.

00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:57.800
 So it was just like, this looked quite unprofessional voice.

00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:01.840
 But that was the same way as Bob Marley had his sandwiches, wasn't it?

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:03.200
 Oh, my God.

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:04.200
 Lovely.

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:05.200
 We're jamming.

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:06.200
 Yes.

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:07.200
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:08.200
 Amazing.

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:09.200
 Oh, my God.

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:10.200
 Just for the dads, for the dads for listening.

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:14.520
 Actually, speaking of Bob Marley, I was looking into people who were connected.

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:17.800
 They were connected as staff of the Rolling Stones off the back of the fact that they

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:20.960
 had such a good financial package set up for them.

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:23.800
 And just to see if any of them had gone on to anything interesting.

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:28.920
 And found this guy who used to work as private security for the Rolling Stones in the '60s.

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:31.840
 Never permanently, he just had worked for them time to time.

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:33.400
 Like an investigator?

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:37.040
 No, as in like a bouncer or anything.

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:40.120
 And his name was Judge Dredd.

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:43.360
 And obviously not his real name, Alexander Minto Hughes is his real name.

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:46.680
 But he went under the name Judge Dredd, which was his later career, which was, he was an

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:51.240
 English reggae and ska musician, and he was the first ever white guy to have a hit for

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:53.000
 reggae in Jamaica.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 First guy ever.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.560
 And he was massive there and he went over to tour and they had no idea that he was white

00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:58.560
 when he got there.

00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:00.920
 So they were like, my God, who's this, who's this incredible guy?

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:04.880
 He had more band songs on the BBC than anyone else ever before.

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:07.680
 So he was, he was the bouncer for the Stones.

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:08.680
 Cool.

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:09.680
 And he went on to that after.

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:10.680
 That's good.

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:12.880
 My formal ad-law was Tim Hedlitz.

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:17.560
 I lived in Tim Hedlitz's childhood room.

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:18.560
 That was my room.

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:19.560
 Oh, God.

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:21.040
 And they preserved it exactly the way it had been.

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:22.040
 Yes.

00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:23.040
 You weren't allowed to take the posters down, were you?

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:26.280
 No, it was a drawing by Charlie Watts of what it used to look like.

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:33.040
 It was trash by the time I got there.

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:35.040
 Okay, it's time for the final fact of the show.

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:36.480
 And that leaves me.

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:41.600
 My fact this week is that clowns can spot amateur clowns by the amount of makeup that

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:43.360
 they put around their mouths.

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:45.860
 Too much or too little?

00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:48.000
 Too much is the problem.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:54.800
 An amateur clown will do up the top lip with white, with red, with black, they'll do the

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.040
 whole mouth.

00:36:56.040 --> 00:37:00.600
 And the professional clowns, they refer to this as a busted asshole.

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.880
 That's an incredibly upsetting phrase.

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:06.600
 And I wish it was the first time it had even been on this podcast, but it's not.

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:07.600
 Is it?

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:08.600
 What?

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:10.600
 Because, you know, you've got to check the archive of what we've said before on the podcast.

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:11.880
 Yes, so that we don't repeat anything.

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:12.880
 Well, exactly.

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:15.600
 Well, fortunately, we're not repeating this fact, but it's just the second use of the

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:16.600
 phrase, because...

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:17.600
 Oh, God, do we guess?

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:18.600
 When have we said 'busted on' before?

00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:19.600
 I remember it now.

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:20.960
 I'm trying to remember what it was.

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:24.000
 It's not the ladies with the rectum that was...

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.320
 No, it's not the ox rectum.

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:26.320
 That was the name.

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:28.760
 I think it was someone said, it was like a quote from someone.

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:29.760
 Oh, yes.

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:30.760
 It's a phrase.

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:31.760
 That's right.

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:32.760
 It's a phrase.

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:35.000
 It's not as much use as a hat full of busted-out holes.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.000
 Oh, that's right.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.000
 Who is that by?

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.000
 I can't remember.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.000
 Oh, OK.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.440
 Were they referring to a fake clown man?

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:47.560
 So I got this fact from a book called 'God Know' by Pen Gillette, pen of pen and teller.

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:51.120
 So it's all about his life as a magician, how he got to be, who he was, and one of the things

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:52.640
 that he did when he was coming up...

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:53.640
 His name is Pen.

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:56.040
 He must have been able to think of a better name for his memoir.

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:57.640
 I like God Know.

00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:58.640
 From the pen of pen.

00:37:58.640 --> 00:37:59.640
 Yes.

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:00.640
 Like, for instance.

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:01.640
 You're right.

00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:03.400
 Pen Gillette, the best a man can get.

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:04.400
 Yes.

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.400
 That's another one.

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:07.400
 Yeah.

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:12.840
 So he failed title-wise, but the content is quite good.

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:15.840
 He went as a teenager or late teen.

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:19.800
 He went into the Ringling Brothers in Barnum and Bailey Greater Show on Earth Clown College.

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:21.100
 And that was in Florida.

00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:24.920
 And he started doing classes in trapeze and all that stuff.

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:26.600
 And he really sucked at physical comedy.

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:27.720
 He didn't like it at all.

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:28.920
 He learned how to be a clown.

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:32.080
 In the process of being taught how to be a clown, you learn that there's certain things

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:35.600
 that you should and shouldn't do if you want to really get it right.

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:38.440
 And one of the things that they do say is that if you put makeup on the top of your

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:42.200
 lip, you're effectively closing off emotion in a really interesting...

00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:43.200
 It's interesting.

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:44.200
 Yeah.

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:48.120
 So by leaving that empty, you can get more out of a clown's face.

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:50.800
 Whereas an amateur clown just thinks, "I've just got to cake the whole thing."

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:51.800
 And is that...

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:55.200
 Because Ronald McDonald, I think, does it wrong then in my memory?

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:56.440
 It's just died.

00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:57.440
 The poor guy.

00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:58.440
 The poor crofter.

00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:02.800
 No, I think, doesn't he have a busted ass or Ronald McDonald?

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:03.800
 He does.

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:04.800
 Oh, my God.

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:05.800
 Absolutely.

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:08.840
 Well, the legal letters will be flooding their way in.

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:09.840
 Poor houses.

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:16.840
 Well, the area of clown IP is quite interesting because it's sort of mostly egg-based.

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:21.920
 It seems the way that clown makeup is registered is on eggs.

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:26.440
 And this was a thing that was started in 1946 by a guy called Stan Bolt, who wasn't

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:27.440
 a clown.

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:32.200
 He was a chemist, oddly, and he started, you know, when you blow eggs.

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:34.040
 So I suppose that's sort of adjacent to chemistry.

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:36.440
 So you've been blowing the insides out of the eggs?

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:37.440
 Yep.

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:39.720
 We're hollowing out, blowing out the inside of an egg.

00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:43.440
 And then he started painting faces of prominent clowns on these eggs as kind of a hobby.

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:46.400
 And then he developed this huge file of clown faces.

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:48.320
 And all of their makeup is completely different.

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:51.120
 I always thought, Stan and the clown, they all look the same.

00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:54.360
 I'm embarrassing now that I thought that because if you look at the egg collection, they all

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:56.720
 look completely different.

00:39:56.720 --> 00:40:02.240
 And actually there's a suitcase of hollowed-out egg faces that he painted that still exists,

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:03.720
 which is quite impressive.

00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:05.120
 It still exists in London, doesn't it?

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:06.120
 Exactly.

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:07.440
 The collection still exists in London.

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:13.080
 It does exist in London, but it used to be held in a, it was in a museum, wasn't it?

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:18.920
 And I think it was only once a month it would open because of the costs of keeping it going.

00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:20.600
 But now it's not even there anymore.

00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:22.520
 There was a flood in the museum.

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:27.040
 And the clown faces, the eggs are kept in the basement of this guy in Clarkhamwell,

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:29.280
 who was the archivist of the museum.

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:30.280
 Are you serious?

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:32.360
 There's been a terrible flood.

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:34.640
 So as a result, we've moved them to a basement.

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:37.240
 Put them in the attic.

00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:38.920
 Yeah, really good point.

00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:42.000
 He probably lives in the ground four flat, I don't know.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.640
 But yeah, apparently during lockdown, he kind of got through it by going checking all of

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:48.760
 his archives from the clown museum.

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:50.920
 That's how he got through in lockdown.

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:55.000
 Seeing a cupboard with a thousand creepy painted eggs living there.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.520
 It gets worse.

00:40:56.520 --> 00:41:02.480
 He also has 47 clown costumes and 20 pairs of clown shoes, which he would go and look

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:04.000
 at from time to time.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.040
 But he said in an interview, "The only reason you get clown shoes in a museum is because

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:10.120
 the clown who wore them has died."

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:14.080
 Ernest Hemingway was once asked to write the saddest poem he could with six words and it

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:19.880
 was, "For sale, clown shoes, too big."

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:22.760
 Have any of you guys been to clown school?

00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:25.320
 No, but you have, I have.

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:28.880
 Just in case one of you guys had also been present and I hadn't noticed.

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:30.320
 It was a horrible experience.

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:31.320
 Is it?

00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:32.320
 Yeah.

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:33.320
 Why?

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:36.600
 It's not clowns as in, you know, like big shoes and tiny cars, it's a different type

00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:37.600
 of clown school.

00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:38.600
 No.

00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:45.000
 It's the sort of upsetting Gaulier-Lacoc, the master will break you down and then rebuild

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.000
 you thing.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.240
 Like learning to fall over and stuff.

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:53.360
 No, no, none of that, no, no, you get horribly insulted by the instructor.

00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:56.880
 They're trying to work out who your comedy character is, is that right?

00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:57.880
 A little bit, yeah.

00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:59.680
 And you are arriving in a tiny car.

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:03.680
 That's the airport pickup.

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:10.040
 Did everyone get horribly insulted by the instructor or were you just not very good?

00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:13.160
 There was one guy who was a bit of a teacher's pet who didn't get horribly instructed, but

00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:16.520
 the rest of us all got, and it was only a four-day course as well, so they had time

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:20.320
 to kind of break us down very badly, but not really time to build us back up again.

00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:22.720
 So it was four of the worst days of my life, I would say.

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:27.640
 They water-barred you with confetti, didn't they?

00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:31.800
 I had to smell so many flowers.

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:38.520
 Have you guys heard of Lady Avetta, who was in 1895 called the only lady clown?

00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:39.520
 Oh, no.

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:44.040
 Probably wasn't the only lady clown at the time, but she was a very famous clown, and

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:49.640
 one of her favorite tricks was she would sit in the audience and next to some unsuspecting

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:56.280
 bloke, and then she would claim that that was actually her fiance and heckle the ringmaster

00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:58.160
 saying, "You looking at my fiance?"

00:42:58.160 --> 00:42:59.840
 That kind of thing.

00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:04.280
 What I really like about her is that there's a quote from her in the New York Times, and

00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:08.320
 she said, "All my people laughed at me when I told them I was going into the ring as a

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:10.480
 clown, but they do not laugh now."

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:11.480
 Oh my god.

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:12.480
 Isn't it?

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:13.480
 Bob Monkhouse.

00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:16.120
 It's supposed to be a Bob Monkhouse joke, but actually it's from 1895.

00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:17.120
 Really?

00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:19.880
 Actually, Bob Monkhouse was so old, it was a really good joke.

00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:21.360
 He was the husband.

00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:22.360
 That's amazing.

00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:24.660
 Yeah, isn't that cool?

00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:29.820
 Another female clown, Annie Fratellini, she founded the first circus school in Europe.

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:32.840
 In 1975.

00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:37.120
 She did the full kind of Auguste clown of these.

00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:41.200
 You've got white face, you've got the red lips and all that kind of stuff.

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:45.200
 When she was asked whether she was portraying a male or a female, she insisted that clowns

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:47.360
 have no gender.

00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:51.440
 She founded the first circus school, so I think she is the authority on that.

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:53.800
 If you see a clown, you think it's a man or a woman, it's not.

00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:56.000
 It's just a clown.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:01.140
 Her grandfather was Paul Fratellini, Paul Francois and Albert.

00:44:01.140 --> 00:44:05.820
 They were famous clowns, all three of them, really, really famous clowns, and their father,

00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:11.140
 so her great-grandfather was Gustavo Fratellini, and he was an Italian patriot who, along with

00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:17.740
 Giuseppe Garibaldi, took part in the unification of Italy, but imagine unifying Italy, and

00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:19.460
 then all of your kids are clowns.

00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:21.180
 Isn't that a weird stuff?

00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:24.180
 What was it all for?

00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:25.700
 That's amazing.

00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:29.480
 Just on the clown sex thing, clowns don't have a sex, that does kind of make sense,

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:33.480
 because otherwise you're implying the existence of clown genitalia, which is...

00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:35.920
 And that would be what sacrilege to a clown?

00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:39.360
 Where does the "ha ha" sound come from, if not from...

00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:43.560
 That's not them squeezing their balls, is it?

00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:44.560
 Or vaginas.

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:51.440
 But they can do amazing balloon tricks, actually, that's the really clever thing.

00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:57.740
 Henry IV of France had his life saved by a clown, by his own clown, in 1594, an assassin

00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:02.940
 got into his bedroom and was going to assassinate him, and he was in there with his clown.

00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:03.940
 Oh yeah.

00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:04.940
 Oh yeah.

00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:05.940
 And...

00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:06.940
 Just testing, is it true?

00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:08.940
 Would they say the clowns have no genitals?

00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:11.100
 Maybe we could test the theory.

00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:14.100
 Do you know what they say about men with big feet?

00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:16.940
 There was nothing untoward going on, the clown was still in...

00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:19.940
 How about a bust of that?

00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:21.940
 Oh wow.

00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:25.940
 No assholes were busted in the making of this.

00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:26.940
 Escapade.

00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:34.580
 This was actually a female clown as well, she was called a maturine de Valois, and she

00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:39.440
 arrested the assassin and stopped the assassin leaving the room, and thus saved his life.

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:45.000
 I don't know how she did it, I don't know if it was confetti to the face, but yeah.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.400
 That's incredible.

00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:49.400
 And then his hand was burned with molten sulphur and lead.

00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:50.400
 Whose hand?

00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:51.400
 The assassin.

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:52.400
 As a punishment.

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:53.400
 As a punishment.

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:54.400
 Because it was the hand that...

00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:55.400
 It's a punishment.

00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:56.400
 I'm wrong.

00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:57.400
 Wow.

00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:58.400
 That's crazy.

00:45:58.400 --> 00:45:59.400
 Sorry.

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:04.460
 Because it was the hand that touched the king, and then he was executed.

00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:08.900
 Oh, I thought that was like a "we'll let you off on this occasion, but we'll mess up

00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:09.900
 your hand."

00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:12.540
 No, no, it was "we'll mess up your hand and then we'll kill you, and then we'll chop you

00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:13.540
 into loads of pieces."

00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:14.540
 That was a different time.

00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:18.800
 That was okay then.

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:20.760
 You know they don't say "break a leg" in Clownland?

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:21.760
 Do they not?

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:22.760
 No.

00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:23.760
 What do they say?

00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:24.760
 They say "bump a nose."

00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:25.760
 Oh, that's good.

00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:26.760
 Bump a nose.

00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:27.760
 A group of clowns together?

00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:28.760
 What are they called?

00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:29.760
 Clowntown.

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:30.760
 No, as in like the collective noun.

00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:32.200
 A collective noun of clowns.

00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:33.200
 Yes.

00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:34.200
 A collective clown.

00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:35.200
 A hulk of clowns?

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:36.200
 A hulk?

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:37.200
 A clowns?

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:38.200
 No.

00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:43.200
 Just like the listener, Jane's hand did go under the table now.

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:45.320
 It's a giggle.

00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:48.580
 Like a gaggle of geese and a gaggle of clowns.

00:46:48.580 --> 00:46:50.940
 Can I tell you one clown trick?

00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:56.180
 I was on the website of clown historian Bruce Charlie Johnson, which is an unbelievably

00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:57.420
 good clowning site.

00:46:57.420 --> 00:47:01.460
 It's one of those old websites which, you know, made about 15 years ago, so it looks

00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:06.320
 very old, but it's just full of great information, and there was a clown who told the world called

00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:09.820
 Adolf Proper decades and decades ago, but one of his tricks was this.

00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:14.640
 I think it's very important that we know exactly how many decades ago Adolf Proper was

00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:15.640
 storing.

00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:19.800
 Was it seven decades ago or was it nine decades ago?

00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:22.920
 Early 20th century, as far as I'm getting.

00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:23.920
 Okay.

00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:28.400
 But basically they had this musical comedy act, a clowning act, and he could produce

00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:30.000
 large numbers of items from his coat.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.000
 That was the thing.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:32.000
 It's kind of a Mary Poppins bag.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.000
 Okay.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.000
 Get what he produced.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000
 300 bananas.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:42.060
 57% of which could be peeled.

00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:48.940
 Three watermelons, six pineapples, four oranges, 24 neckties, a broom, an oboe, 12 mandolins,

00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:54.340
 a cigar box, a trash can, a hatchet, a music stand, and other items.

00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:55.340
 Oh my God.

00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:59.120
 It was what he got out of one coat, and the way he did it was they were all collapsible.

00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:00.120
 They were made from papier-mache.

00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:01.120
 Oh.

00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:02.120
 So good.

00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:05.660
 And they were sort of intricate springs, so they all expanded whenever they were produced.

00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:06.660
 That's really clever.

00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:07.660
 That's great.

00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:08.660
 That's fabulous.

00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:11.960
 Although I really thought, because you started with a list of fruit and then you said 24 neckties

00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:15.040
 and I thought you thought that was the plural of nectarine.

00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:16.040
 What?

00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:26.360
 Why have I been wearing this around my neck all this time then?

00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:29.660
 Okay, that's it.

00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:30.840
 That is all of our facts.

00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:32.240
