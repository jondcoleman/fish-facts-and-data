00:00:13,00:00:19,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:19,00:00:22,to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:00:22,00:00:26,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray"
00:00:26,00:00:31,and James Harkin and once again we have gathered round the microphones with our four favorite
00:00:31,00:00:36,"facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:36,00:00:39,"Starting with fact number one, that is Anna."
00:00:39,00:00:44,My fact this week is that scientists have invented a 30 centimeter tall robot that could
00:00:44,00:00:50,jump over the Statue of Liberty if it was on the moon.
00:00:50,00:00:51,If they were both on the moon?
00:00:51,00:00:55,"If they were both, yes sorry not if the Statue of Liberty was on the moon and the robot was"
00:00:55,00:00:58,"on Earth, that would be incredible."
00:00:58,00:01:01,"So sorry, we've moved the Statue of Liberty to the moon."
00:01:01,00:01:03,"That's right yes, which I don't know why."
00:01:03,00:01:07,"So aliens when they first come, the first thing they see is the moon right before they"
00:01:07,00:01:09,see the Earth unless it's on the other side.
00:01:09,00:01:11,Depends what side they're coming from.
00:01:11,00:01:13,I'm assuming they come from the moon side.
00:01:13,00:01:16,The first thing they see is liberty and lightening the world.
00:01:16,00:01:19,"So we'll have to move it to the dark side of the moon, or rather the further side of"
00:01:19,00:01:20,the moon.
00:01:20,00:01:22,So we'll never see it again because the moon and the Earth are locked aren't they?
00:01:22,00:01:24,That all the moon is tidally locked or whatever.
00:01:24,00:01:26,So we'll just never see it.
00:01:26,00:01:28,"But you've seen, you know what it looks like now don't you?"
00:01:28,00:01:29,We've got pictures.
00:01:29,00:01:32,We've got pictures.
00:01:32,00:01:39,"So this robot, which is an amazing robot, this jump, without leaping over the Statue"
00:01:39,00:01:41,"of Liberty, it can leap 10 meters right?"
00:01:41,00:01:44,"Yeah yeah, it can still leap quite high, it can actually leap 30 meters."
00:01:44,00:01:48,So it can leap over a 10 story building.
00:01:48,00:01:51,"So it could also jump over the Statue of Christ to Redeemer in Brazil I think, I'm pretty"
00:01:51,00:01:52,sure.
00:01:52,00:01:53,And that's if it was on Earth.
00:01:53,00:01:54,And that's on Earth.
00:01:54,00:01:57,"If we've got the Christ to Redeemer back from the moon, where we put it."
00:01:57,00:02:00,"Right, because he always goes with the Statue of Liberty doesn't he?"
00:02:00,00:02:01,They're dating.
00:02:01,00:02:04,But how tall then is the Statue of Liberty?
00:02:04,00:02:10,"So the Statue of Liberty is 93 meters I believe, and this could jump on the moon 125 meters."
00:02:10,00:02:14,So it could actually jump the Statue of Liberty's height and then about a third as high again.
00:02:14,00:02:17,If she was giving Christ to Redeemer a piggyback.
00:02:17,00:02:21,"Yes, I think that should, yeah yeah yeah, that would work."
00:02:21,00:02:25,"Yeah yeah, hard to do though with the arm angles of both statues."
00:02:25,00:02:29,I'm just trying to work out how the piggyback would work architecturally.
00:02:29,00:02:32,"Well he's fine, because he's up top, he's got his arms out."
00:02:32,00:02:33,"Yeah, he's fine."
00:02:33,00:02:38,Do you know that the Angel of the North is actually giving Christ to Redeemer a hug?
00:02:38,00:02:41,But they're just so far away you never see it happen.
00:02:41,00:02:45,"Wow, but tectonics one day will bring them together, eventually they'll meet."
00:02:45,00:02:50,"Anyway, this is a jumping robot and the scientists are very excited because it's really the highest"
00:02:50,00:02:56,"robot's ever jumped, proportionally for its size, and it's quite a basic looking thing."
00:02:56,00:03:00,It's made of rubber bands and some carbon fiber slats because they store energy really
00:03:00,00:03:02,well and it does have a motor.
00:03:02,00:03:07,"Yeah, so I just wanted to say, it has a motor, does that count as a jump if you have a motor?"
00:03:07,00:03:14,"Well, it's not using the motor to propel itself in the air, it's using its motor like we would"
00:03:14,00:03:17,use a muscle I guess to bounce a jump.
00:03:17,00:03:19,To wind up the rubber bands.
00:03:19,00:03:20,Exactly.
00:03:20,00:03:23,"But maybe it counts, maybe it doesn't take it up with the researchers, I think they've"
00:03:23,00:03:24,cheated on a number of fronts here.
00:03:24,00:03:26,"First of all, they put it on the moon."
00:03:26,00:03:30,"But it's a robot, you're allowed to give a robot a motor, aren't you?"
00:03:30,00:03:35,"Yeah, you are, they're showing off that it can jump way better than like anything in"
00:03:35,00:03:36,nature.
00:03:36,00:03:37,Showing off.
00:03:37,00:03:39,"They're saying that the reason is they're saying, ""Oh, my mind is better than everything"
00:03:39,00:03:40,"in nature."""
00:03:40,00:03:41,"In your face, Grasshopper."
00:03:41,00:03:47,But the reason it does it is because it has these carbon fiber slats and stuff like that.
00:03:47,00:03:50,"But actually, I would argue that one of the reasons is that they're using a motor, but"
00:03:50,00:03:51,I don't know.
00:03:51,00:03:52,I agree.
00:03:52,00:03:57,"But I reckon they could do it with the force of just like a human pulling it, I think really,"
00:03:57,00:03:59,or maybe they could do it with wind up.
00:03:59,00:04:02,They'd have to have some sort of force applied.
00:04:02,00:04:05,"But yeah, the motor is not flying it through the air like an aeroplane, it's not just an"
00:04:05,00:04:06,aeroplane.
00:04:06,00:04:07,Right.
00:04:07,00:04:12,"Also, it doesn't look like, whenever I hear robot, I think it's got two legs, two arms,"
00:04:12,00:04:15,"humanoid kind of, well, not even humanoid, but you know, it's-"
00:04:15,00:04:16,C3PO.
00:04:16,00:04:17,"Yeah, exactly."
00:04:17,00:04:20,Why do you not think R2-D2 is a robot then?
00:04:20,00:04:22,"Yeah, good question."
00:04:22,00:04:24,"God, do you really set him a trap there?"
00:04:24,00:04:25,No.
00:04:25,00:04:28,"That was a topical liar, wasn't it?"
00:04:28,00:04:36,"Well, your honor, can I ask my client, actually the other person's client, does he think that"
00:04:36,00:04:37,R2-D2 is a robot?
00:04:37,00:04:39,"If you're a lawyer, James, you absolutely would do that."
00:04:39,00:04:43,"You start cross-examining your own witness hot pan, just so you could use some point"
00:04:43,00:04:44,to be made.
00:04:44,00:04:47,You kind of set him up knowing that he's going to give me the wrong answer as well.
00:04:47,00:04:48,Sorry.
00:04:48,00:04:49,That's fine.
00:04:49,00:04:53,"Damn it, I've had so much thinking time, I still haven't got an answer."
00:04:53,00:04:57,"Yeah, it's obviously a robot, but so it's just worth saying that this one looks kind"
00:04:57,00:05:00,"of like a toy for a cat, right?"
00:05:00,00:05:01,"Yeah, yeah."
00:05:01,00:05:03,It's a little ball that you would play with.
00:05:03,00:05:08,"Yeah, it's got two wheels at cross-angles, or maybe three, I can't remember."
00:05:08,00:05:11,"Yeah, it's like two bike wheels have crashed into each other at right angles, or like the"
00:05:11,00:05:14,skeleton of a football.
00:05:14,00:05:18,"Anyway, it's weird looking robot, I'll give you that."
00:05:18,00:05:23,"Your Honor, I have another question."
00:05:23,00:05:28,"The way it works, I should say, is that it's basically by releasing a really, really strong"
00:05:28,00:05:30,"elastic force, isn't it?"
00:05:30,00:05:34,"So it's got these rubber bands that are stretched really, really super far, and this makes the"
00:05:34,00:05:40,"carbon fiber bend like an archer's bow would bend, and then when you release those elastic"
00:05:40,00:05:45,"bands, then the archer's bow bends straightens, and it shoots up into the air, and it makes"
00:05:45,00:05:46,the comedy noise.
00:05:46,00:05:49,"Yeah, they had to add that sound effect, it actually has quite a lot of weight."
00:05:49,00:05:50,It's very cool.
00:05:50,00:05:51,Yeah.
00:05:51,00:05:52,It is very cool.
00:05:52,00:05:55,"Did it, was it a surprise to them how high it went the first time?"
00:05:55,00:06:01,"I didn't even want it to jump, it just leapt out of their hands."
00:06:01,00:06:05,"This is the world's best standing still rope, oh, fucking hell."
00:06:05,00:06:09,We've invented the perfect coffee table.
00:06:09,00:06:14,"One of the other good things about it is that it's able to write itself when it lands, and"
00:06:14,00:06:18,"so it sort of re-inflates on the ground, and then gets upright, and then jumps away again."
00:06:18,00:06:19,Great.
00:06:19,00:06:23,"So it keeps you on your toes, and it will be useful, apparently, this kind of technology"
00:06:23,00:06:24,in space.
00:06:24,00:06:29,"You know, in space we've got robots and asteroids already that jump over the little lumps, and"
00:06:29,00:06:31,it could jump over big lumps.
00:06:31,00:06:35,"I don't know that, more like on Mars kind of thing."
00:06:35,00:06:36,Exactly.
00:06:36,00:06:37,"There's a boulder in the way, yeah."
00:06:37,00:06:38,Exactly.
00:06:38,00:06:41,I don't need to jump a hundred meters into the air.
00:06:41,00:06:43,Could be a big boulder.
00:06:43,00:06:45,"Could be a big boulder, that's true."
00:06:45,00:06:50,"I was looking up jumping records, I got a bit distracted thinking, when do you think"
00:06:50,00:06:51,the queen last jumped?
00:06:51,00:06:53,Has she ever jumped?
00:06:53,00:06:57,"I'm sure she did, because she's been a child, you know, she would have jumped and done skipping"
00:06:57,00:06:58,and things like that.
00:06:58,00:07:00,I've never seen her jump to my knowledge.
00:07:00,00:07:03,Is there any footage of the queen jumping?
00:07:03,00:07:04,Does anyone know?
00:07:04,00:07:06,"If you have, send it in, and you could win £250."
00:07:06,00:07:14,"When do you need to jump in life, when you're skipping, that's exercise, when you're exercising"
00:07:14,00:07:15,in general?
00:07:15,00:07:16,Exercise in general.
00:07:16,00:07:20,"If she goes on long walks, there might be a little stream that she's jumping in."
00:07:20,00:07:24,Like if a corgi gets in the way when you're walking for your purpose.
00:07:24,00:07:25,Jump the corgi.
00:07:25,00:07:27,I think that corgi's a better train than that.
00:07:27,00:07:31,Do you think that's what they say when a monarch has gone too far?
00:07:31,00:07:33,"Oh, she's really jumped the corgi now."
00:07:33,00:07:37,"I don't know, Andy."
00:07:37,00:07:38,"In fact, none of us knows."
00:07:38,00:07:39,We're just speculating.
00:07:39,00:07:40,Great question.
00:07:40,00:07:42,"I think she has jumped, but I don't think for a while."
00:07:42,00:07:45,Do you know the highest jump by a horse?
00:07:45,00:07:46,Record.
00:07:46,00:07:47,So was this Olympics?
00:07:47,00:07:48,"No, it wasn't."
00:07:48,00:07:49,It's just the record.
00:07:49,00:07:52,"Although they did do the horse high jump, didn't they, in the really early Olympics."
00:07:52,00:07:53,And long jump we covered as well.
00:07:53,00:07:54,Yeah.
00:07:54,00:07:58,"So Anna, I guess you mean the horse is allowed to run up to the thing, so it's not jumping"
00:07:58,00:07:59,from a standing position.
00:07:59,00:08:00,"No, it's not jumping from a standing position."
00:08:00,00:08:03,I bet horses can't even do that.
00:08:03,00:08:04,I bet they can't.
00:08:04,00:08:06,Jump from a standing position.
00:08:06,00:08:07,Yeah.
00:08:07,00:08:08,They can jump from a standing position.
00:08:08,00:08:09,They've got muscles in their legs.
00:08:09,00:08:10,The queen can do it.
00:08:10,00:08:11,Can she do it on a horse though?
00:08:11,00:08:12,"Because she rides a lot, doesn't she?"
00:08:12,00:08:14,She can't jump the horse.
00:08:14,00:08:17,Can the queen jump over a horse from a standing position?
00:08:17,00:08:22,I think I've seen that happen at like badminton and stuff where they have like multiple fences
00:08:22,00:08:25,"to go over and they'll stop from one to the other, I think."
00:08:25,00:08:26,They definitely do that.
00:08:26,00:08:27,"I mean, I've seen horses do it as well."
00:08:27,00:08:30,I think they're quite better at it than we are.
00:08:30,00:08:31,I think you're right.
00:08:31,00:08:35,"I'm thinking of a horse standing with all its legs straight, but you're allowed to bend"
00:08:35,00:08:36,your legs before you jump.
00:08:36,00:08:37,Yeah.
00:08:37,00:08:38,It can't fire itself up.
00:08:38,00:08:44,I actually don't think you can jump without a tiny bit of bending of any muscles.
00:08:44,00:08:47,"You think you can, but now when you think about it, you're like, actually, I am moving"
00:08:47,00:08:51,"my ankles a bit if I do that, sort of, if I do that pencil jump."
00:08:51,00:08:52,Yeah.
00:08:52,00:08:53,Yeah.
00:08:53,00:08:57,"But it wasn't a pencil jump, just a normal horse jump."
00:08:57,00:08:59,"I think it's, I remember a fact."
00:08:59,00:09:02,I think it's shorter than the human high jump.
00:09:02,00:09:06,"It's actually not that much higher than it, but it is a bit higher and it's beat everyone"
00:09:06,00:09:08,else by quite a long way or the other horses.
00:09:08,00:09:13,So it's eight foot one inch and the record was set in 1949 and it's never been broken.
00:09:13,00:09:14,Wow.
00:09:14,00:09:15,Really?
00:09:15,00:09:19,"And it was set by this really, this cool horse called Hwasso and Hwasso."
00:09:19,00:09:20,Hwasso.
00:09:20,00:09:21,Hwasso.
00:09:21,00:09:22,Hwasso.
00:09:22,00:09:23,Oh my God.
00:09:23,00:09:24,It's called Hwasso.
00:09:24,00:09:27,"Well, it was a horse in Chile."
00:09:27,00:09:30,And I guess Hwasso was the Chilean for horse in the 40s.
00:09:30,00:09:33,Oh my Hwasso.
00:09:33,00:09:34,My kingdom for a Hwasso.
00:09:34,00:09:38,It came from New York to Chile.
00:09:38,00:09:44,"Anyway, it was really bad at everything else and it was almost retired."
00:09:44,00:09:48,"In fact, I think it was almost put down because it failed at racing, at dressage, at show"
00:09:48,00:09:50,jumping because it was very hard to control.
00:09:50,00:09:54,And then an army officer was wandering by its field one day and saw it jump over a fence
00:09:54,00:09:57,"and thought, my God, that's high and bought the horse on the spot."
00:09:57,00:10:01,And they trained it up specifically just to break the world horse high jump record.
00:10:01,00:10:02,Cool.
00:10:02,00:10:06,"And it did it and it broke the record when it was 16 and the moment it broke it, it retired."
00:10:06,00:10:08,And it was never written again.
00:10:08,00:10:09,Wow.
00:10:09,00:10:10,Really good.
00:10:10,00:10:11,Isn't that nice?
00:10:11,00:10:12,One moment of glory in its life.
00:10:12,00:10:13,Yeah.
00:10:13,00:10:14,And I went to quit.
00:10:14,00:10:15,It retired or it was retired?
00:10:15,00:10:18,"It made the decision, it signed the forms with little hoof prints."
00:10:18,00:10:24,They put it into a field with very high fences.
00:10:24,00:10:25,"Some stuff on robots, maybe?"
00:10:25,00:10:26,"Oh, yeah."
00:10:26,00:10:31,One thing that's really hard for robots to do is handle soft fruit.
00:10:31,00:10:33,But there is a - what?
00:10:33,00:10:38,"Because they don't need to eat fruit, I suppose, so I can't imagine it being a problem."
00:10:38,00:10:39,They haven't needed to learn.
00:10:39,00:10:40,Yeah.
00:10:40,00:10:43,But what if you want a robot to prepare you some fruit?
00:10:43,00:10:44,That's a good point.
00:10:44,00:10:45,That's a good point.
00:10:45,00:10:46,And I do.
00:10:46,00:10:47,"The problem is that fruit is uneven in shape, right?"
00:10:47,00:10:50,"So even if you have two apples, they might not be exactly the same."
00:10:50,00:10:52,Two bananas might not be exactly the same.
00:10:52,00:10:56,But there's a guy called Hichiyo Kim at the University of Tokyo and he and his colleagues
00:10:56,00:11:02,have developed a machine learning robot that has learned how to peel a banana.
00:11:02,00:11:09,So it took 811 minutes of data that it had to watch to learn how to do this banana.
00:11:09,00:11:14,"The task was divided into nine stages, like first of all grasping the banana, then picking"
00:11:14,00:11:16,"it up off the table, blah, blah, blah."
00:11:16,00:11:17,Okay.
00:11:17,00:11:22,So they have this robot that can successfully peel a banana 57% of the time.
00:11:22,00:11:30,I'm not going to stop my holiday beach bar with it.
00:11:30,00:11:32,It took ages as well.
00:11:32,00:11:34,There's three minutes.
00:11:34,00:11:35,Three minutes.
00:11:35,00:11:40,The queue is building up at Robo's beach bar for the banana smoothies.
00:11:40,00:11:54,"I was reading about you can get these new robot smart suitcases, which, oh, it just"
00:11:54,00:11:55,looks so cool.
00:11:55,00:11:56,So what do they do?
00:11:56,00:11:57,It just follows you.
00:11:57,00:12:00,"So like, let's imagine you're in the airport and you're just walking to your plane."
00:12:00,00:12:02,It's just coming up next to you beside you.
00:12:02,00:12:03,Is it with a magnet or something?
00:12:03,00:12:07,"Because I've often thought you could get a great, like if you have the right magnet."
00:12:07,00:12:08,No.
00:12:08,00:12:09,No.
00:12:09,00:12:10,"No, it's not."
00:12:10,00:12:14,It's more likely radio waves coming from your phone and it just follows the waves.
00:12:14,00:12:15,Exactly.
00:12:15,00:12:16,"That would be another way of doing it, Bob."
00:12:16,00:12:17,Yeah.
00:12:17,00:12:18,I feel a great big magnet.
00:12:18,00:12:20,Walking through security in the airport with a massive magnet.
00:12:20,00:12:23,"Yeah, I can see that working."
00:12:23,00:12:27,"And also everyone else has the same luggage as you, right?"
00:12:27,00:12:30,That's one problem.
00:12:30,00:12:35,Everyone's just attracted to your massive magnet and you're just walking around Heathrow
00:12:35,00:12:38,with a hundred bags attached to you.
00:12:38,00:12:39,"It's not feasible, Andy."
00:12:39,00:12:43,It's like a beekeeper for suitcases.
00:12:43,00:12:45,A beard of suitcases.
00:12:45,00:12:53,"Yeah, there are some teething troubles, Murrow's magnet suitcase, yeah."
00:12:53,00:12:58,"But yeah, so no, it's also got facial, so it is a phone and there's facial recognition"
00:12:58,00:13:02,"and the facial recognition, that does mean if someone like Andy tries to run off with"
00:13:02,00:13:06,"your suitcase, it's got an alarm system that says, ""No, no."""
00:13:06,00:13:07,"Oh, that's clever."
00:13:07,00:13:08,Does it scream?
00:13:08,00:13:13,"No, Mr Murray, no, please."
00:13:13,00:13:14,That's really clever.
00:13:14,00:13:15,"Yeah, thank you."
00:13:15,00:13:16,That's great.
00:13:16,00:13:18,"So, sorry, how does it, I can't remember now how it works."
00:13:18,00:13:19,It follows you around.
00:13:19,00:13:22,"Yeah, so you've got, I guess you'll have an app on your phone and it's in its facial"
00:13:22,00:13:23,recognition.
00:13:23,00:13:24,Is this a thing?
00:13:24,00:13:25,What force?
00:13:25,00:13:26,Oh.
00:13:26,00:13:27,Sorry.
00:13:27,00:13:28,What is it using?
00:13:28,00:13:29,It uses a motor.
00:13:29,00:13:30,Cheating.
00:13:30,00:13:31,Cheating with a motor.
00:13:31,00:13:32,It's one of the cheating robots.
00:13:32,00:13:33,Cheating with a motor.
00:13:33,00:13:35,"So, it's like remote controlled only, instead of using a remote control, it's just following"
00:13:35,00:13:36,your phone.
00:13:36,00:13:37,Yeah.
00:13:37,00:13:41,"But was there not a guy, when we were in New York and we were walking down the street,"
00:13:41,00:13:47,"was there not a guy on a motorised, what's it called, skateboard who fell off his skateboard"
00:13:47,00:13:52,and then his skateboard was like five metres away from him and he pressed a button on his
00:13:52,00:13:54,phone and it kind of followed and came up to him.
00:13:54,00:13:55,Wow.
00:13:55,00:13:56,Do you remember that?
00:13:56,00:13:57,I didn't see that.
00:13:57,00:13:58,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we were walking along the street and he came up, he looked like"
00:13:58,00:14:01,"a bit of a chump, he fell off his skateboard."
00:14:01,00:14:03,But then he summoned it like a dog and it was cool.
00:14:03,00:14:04,Are you sure?
00:14:04,00:14:06,"Because I remember the guy coming off, but I don't remember the skateboard return."
00:14:06,00:14:07,I do remember that.
00:14:07,00:14:08,That did happen.
00:14:08,00:14:09,Wow.
00:14:09,00:14:10,"Same technology, or a magnet."
00:14:10,00:14:11,Or a magnet.
00:14:11,00:14:18,"He wouldn't have fallen off at all, with a magnet in place."
00:14:18,00:14:26,"Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James."
00:14:26,00:14:31,"Okay, my fact this week is that the last ever speaker of the bow language of the Andaman"
00:14:31,00:14:40,Islands would only speak it to birds who she considered to be her ancestors.
00:14:40,00:14:44,"So you might remember a few weeks ago we talked about the Andaman Islands, about elephants"
00:14:44,00:14:46,swimming among them.
00:14:46,00:14:49,"I did a lot of research about the Andaman Islands themselves, but we never used it,"
00:14:49,00:14:52,so here we are again.
00:14:52,00:14:56,"This is recycling, Greta would be proud."
00:14:56,00:15:01,"This is the Andaman Islands, as we said before, they are between just off the coast of India"
00:15:01,00:15:08,and it is an article that I read on BBC online about Professor Anvita Abbey who has written
00:15:08,00:15:14,the first dictionary of this language and she talked about this last speaker who was
00:15:14,00:15:19,"called Boa Senior and she said that, you know, I spoke to this person, got all the words,"
00:15:19,00:15:21,"blah, blah, blah."
00:15:21,00:15:25,But whenever this woman- Did she have to dress as a bird?
00:15:25,00:15:33,"Well, she said Professor Anvita Abbey, she said they caught this woman speaking it to"
00:15:33,00:15:36,"the birds and when they asked her about it, why are you speaking it to a bird?"
00:15:36,00:15:40,"They said, well, they are ancestors and they are the only ones who understand my language"
00:15:40,00:15:43,besides yourself.
00:15:43,00:15:44,"And yeah, this is- Wow."
00:15:44,00:15:45,That's very sad.
00:15:45,00:15:46,Yeah.
00:15:46,00:15:50,"If she dressed as a bird, she would have been a feathered bird."
00:15:50,00:15:51,"Oh, brilliant."
00:15:51,00:15:56,So she could have done that but it probably wouldn't work in her language.
00:15:56,00:15:58,That was the tragedy.
00:15:58,00:15:59,It is.
00:15:59,00:16:03,She spent 30 years as the only person speaking it.
00:16:03,00:16:04,Such a long time.
00:16:04,00:16:05,It is a long time.
00:16:05,00:16:10,She obviously knew other variations of Hindi that she also spoke on the islands.
00:16:10,00:16:13,She could talk to other people in some ways.
00:16:13,00:16:19,"She was quite spry, so she died in 2010 and she was in her mid-80s, I think."
00:16:19,00:16:24,"But when the Indian Ocean tsunami came in 2004, was it, I think?"
00:16:24,00:16:25,Yes.
00:16:25,00:16:26,Yes.
00:16:26,00:16:28,She was 79 years old and she had to climb up a tree to escape it.
00:16:28,00:16:29,Yeah.
00:16:29,00:16:30,A tree.
00:16:30,00:16:31,Yeah.
00:16:31,00:16:33,Maybe she asked the birds to lift her up into the branches of the tree.
00:16:33,00:16:34,It's very possible.
00:16:34,00:16:39,Maybe she has a little motorised little thing in her ankle and was lobbed up into the tree.
00:16:39,00:16:46,It was really interesting about that because her group used really old knowledge to see
00:16:46,00:16:48,that there was a tsunami coming.
00:16:48,00:16:52,So it's the Angay tribe that she was part of.
00:16:52,00:16:56,They used knowledge by the type of fish that are found at different levels of seawater.
00:16:56,00:17:00,"So when the sea really went out, there were different fish that they could see and they"
00:17:00,00:17:02,"could see that there was a problem, so they went to high ground."
00:17:02,00:17:03,What?
00:17:03,00:17:07,There was another group called the Ajarawas who were in the Andaman Islands and they saw
00:17:07,00:17:12,the patterns of the waves changing and they had this ancient knowledge that knew that
00:17:12,00:17:15,there was something that was a problem coming and so they could get away.
00:17:15,00:17:21,"The Andamanese, they're much more sort of integrated into Indian society now and they"
00:17:21,00:17:26,were the slowest to react to this tsunami because they didn't have all of the ancient
00:17:26,00:17:27,knowledge.
00:17:27,00:17:28,Yeah.
00:17:28,00:17:30,"But that is, it's weird you mentioned that because that's one of the things about where"
00:17:30,00:17:33,languages is the fear that that kind of knowledge will get lost.
00:17:33,00:17:36,"In rural communities, there's so much kind of knowledge that we don't know yet."
00:17:36,00:17:40,"I was listening to a really interesting podcast, I think it was the Guardian Science podcast"
00:17:40,00:17:45,and it was about how we're losing medicinal plant knowledge because of all these languages
00:17:45,00:17:46,that are disappearing.
00:17:46,00:17:50,"So it was someone saying that like every botanist, even however much they know, they'll go into"
00:17:50,00:17:54,"the forest and immediately they'll go, ""Shit, I only know about 1% of these plants."""
00:17:54,00:17:58,And yet the local people who live in the Amazon or in Guinea or whatever will know all of them
00:17:58,00:18:01,and will know like what they can be used for.
00:18:01,00:18:07,"And this guy did a study in the Amazon, North America, and New Guinea and he made a list"
00:18:07,00:18:10,"of 12,500 plant purpose pairings."
00:18:10,00:18:14,"My God, it must have taken a long time, but it was, so that's like a plant and then the"
00:18:14,00:18:17,"purpose that it's useful, pairings."
00:18:17,00:18:21,"And he said 75% of them were specific to one language, so they're not shared by any other"
00:18:21,00:18:25,language and most of those languages are endangered languages.
00:18:25,00:18:26,So all of that knowledge would go.
00:18:26,00:18:27,Do they work?
00:18:27,00:18:29,"Sorry, do these 12,500 work?"
00:18:29,00:18:30,He didn't specify that.
00:18:30,00:18:31,He gave examples.
00:18:31,00:18:36,"Like Doc leaves on a nettle stick, the only one I know and it doesn't work."
00:18:36,00:18:38,"But you know aspirin, that comes from that."
00:18:38,00:18:43,"I know how to go into a shop and ask for cow pole, you know."
00:18:43,00:18:47,"Most importantly, it feels like we need to teach people how to do that."
00:18:47,00:18:52,"There's an explorer called Wade Davis who's been pushing this for many, many years."
00:18:52,00:18:53,We've mentioned him on the podcast before.
00:18:53,00:19:02,He's the one who claimed that poo knife was made by Frosty Poo Knife.
00:19:02,00:19:15,So Wade Davis says that and he says this in his talks that he thinks that what our sort
00:19:15,00:19:19,of period of time is going to be known for is it's going to be obviously the destruction
00:19:19,00:19:23,"of the environment, but he thinks the ethnosphere is the biggest thing that we've not noticed"
00:19:23,00:19:27,that we've decimated all the languages of the world are becoming extinct because we
00:19:27,00:19:28,keep spreading out.
00:19:28,00:19:30,We keep saying English is a great language.
00:19:30,00:19:34,Why don't you learn that or French and we lose their languages and all the knowledge
00:19:34,00:19:35,goes with it.
00:19:35,00:19:40,"7,000 languages in the world and 2,000 are endangered as in less than a thousand people"
00:19:40,00:19:41,speak them.
00:19:41,00:19:42,I think.
00:19:42,00:19:43,It's sad.
00:19:43,00:19:44,"They're going extinct every day, aren't they?"
00:19:44,00:19:46,A couple of recent ones.
00:19:46,00:19:52,"If you search on Google News for like extinct last speaker of, you know, there's loads in"
00:19:52,00:19:54,the last couple of years alone.
00:19:54,00:19:55,Really?
00:19:55,00:19:56,Yeah.
00:19:56,00:20:02,"So the next, the Yagan language, the Yagan language, the Yagan language, the Yakan language,"
00:20:02,00:20:10,"the Yamana language, Hausi Kuta, Yagan Kuta, Tekwinitsa and Yapu languages, all on the"
00:20:10,00:20:18,same day because they're all different words for the same language.
00:20:18,00:20:21,This was in Chile.
00:20:21,00:20:23,This is a woman called Christina Calderon.
00:20:23,00:20:29,She was the last speaker of what we would mostly know as Yagan and Yagan language is
00:20:29,00:20:35,most famous among people like us who do this kind of research for a word which is Mami
00:20:35,00:20:41,"Lapinatapai, which got the Guinness World Record in 1993 for being the world's most"
00:20:41,00:20:44,succinct word.
00:20:44,00:20:49,And it means the unspoken but meaningful glance shared between two people during a private
00:20:49,00:20:54,"moment where both individuals know the other, understands what is being expressed."
00:20:54,00:20:56,And say again what it is.
00:20:56,00:20:57,Mami Lapinatapai.
00:20:57,00:20:58,Okay.
00:20:58,00:21:01,It's quite succinct.
00:21:01,00:21:02,Yep.
00:21:02,00:21:04,"I could, I could create a shorter word."
00:21:04,00:21:05,Could you?
00:21:05,00:21:06,But...
00:21:06,00:21:10,"Ah, we all know what you mean."
00:21:10,00:21:13,I read a really interesting piece about this Aussie island.
00:21:13,00:21:14,It's called South Gulburn Island.
00:21:14,00:21:15,I've never heard of it before.
00:21:15,00:21:17,"It's off the coast because it's an island, obviously."
00:21:17,00:21:18,Which coast?
00:21:18,00:21:19,The Australian coast.
00:21:19,00:21:20,And there are only...
00:21:20,00:21:21,"It's only one, Dan."
00:21:21,00:21:22,Yeah.
00:21:22,00:21:23,Yeah.
00:21:23,00:21:24,Yeah.
00:21:24,00:21:25,It goes all the way around.
00:21:25,00:21:26,It goes all the way around.
00:21:26,00:21:27,Sorry.
00:21:27,00:21:28,My bad.
00:21:28,00:21:29,My bad.
00:21:29,00:21:30,Bloody hell.
00:21:30,00:21:31,"Ask a stupid question, mate."
00:21:31,00:21:34,There are 500 people there.
00:21:34,00:21:40,"This was a piece in the Atlantic, by the way, which confusingly is not a relevant notion,"
00:21:40,00:21:41,yes.
00:21:41,00:21:42,But there are 500 people there.
00:21:42,00:21:45,They live in a settlement called Warui Community.
00:21:45,00:21:48,"And between these 500 people, they speak nine languages, right?"
00:21:48,00:21:49,Mm-hmm.
00:21:49,00:21:53,"Now, the really weird thing is that they haven't developed a mutual pigeon, you know, a kind"
00:21:53,00:21:57,"of mash-up language where everyone knows that one, and they don't speak each other's"
00:21:57,00:21:58,languages.
00:21:58,00:22:00,But there are only 500 of them.
00:22:00,00:22:02,"You know, you can't only speak to people who know your language."
00:22:02,00:22:06,"So the way they get along with each other is, they all speak their own languages, and everyone"
00:22:06,00:22:11,else just understands enough of the language the other guy is speaking.
00:22:11,00:22:12,No way.
00:22:12,00:22:16,"Well, effectively, they are like British people on holiday who just use their own language"
00:22:16,00:22:18,and trust that it will be understood.
00:22:18,00:22:19,Yes.
00:22:19,00:22:20,"Oh, wow."
00:22:20,00:22:21,Do they shout really loudly?
00:22:21,00:22:22,Yes.
00:22:22,00:22:24,"And say it really slowly, and in a slightly racist accent?"
00:22:24,00:22:25,They want two beers.
00:22:25,00:22:26,That's what they want.
00:22:26,00:22:27,No.
00:22:27,00:22:28,And they have multi-lingual conversations.
00:22:28,00:22:30,So you walk past two people having a chat about something.
00:22:30,00:22:31,That's interesting.
00:22:31,00:22:34,"One will say something in their own language, the other will reply in a completely different"
00:22:34,00:22:35,language.
00:22:35,00:22:36,Wow.
00:22:36,00:22:37,Weird.
00:22:37,00:22:38,That's unbelievably confusing.
00:22:38,00:22:39,Yeah.
00:22:39,00:22:40,God.
00:22:40,00:22:41,"Well, hey, here's a cool species from the Andaman Islands."
00:22:41,00:22:42,Yeah.
00:22:42,00:22:49,"It's a dabularia jala kenyakai, and it's 10 centimetres tall."
00:22:49,00:22:51,"It's an algae, and it's made of one cell."
00:22:51,00:22:52,Wow.
00:22:52,00:22:53,One cell.
00:22:53,00:22:54,Wow.
00:22:54,00:22:57,"Because we've done the largest single-celled creature, and I feel like it's not that much"
00:22:57,00:22:58,bigger than that.
00:22:58,00:22:59,That's amazing.
00:22:59,00:23:00,"No, I don't think it is."
00:23:00,00:23:01,It's got one nucleus.
00:23:01,00:23:02,It's really weird.
00:23:02,00:23:03,It looks quite complicated.
00:23:03,00:23:05,"It's got roots and a stalk and a cap and all this stuff, and it's just one celled."
00:23:05,00:23:06,I find those so weird.
00:23:06,00:23:08,And how high can it jump?
00:23:08,00:23:11,It's the same as the queen.
00:23:11,00:23:12,Yeah.
00:23:12,00:23:13,Exactly.
00:23:13,00:23:14,It doesn't.
00:23:14,00:23:17,Can I tell you about one more language which died this year?
00:23:17,00:23:18,Yeah.
00:23:18,00:23:22,So this was Gaelic in the Braze of Lecarba.
00:23:22,00:23:27,"It's a vernacular from this area of Scotland, and it was due to the death of Ronnie the"
00:23:27,00:23:31,Crofter who died aged 90 this year.
00:23:31,00:23:35,He was well-known in the Crofting community and the Drowing community.
00:23:35,00:23:36,Do you remember we talked about those?
00:23:36,00:23:37,Yeah.
00:23:37,00:23:38,He was a bit of a drover.
00:23:38,00:23:44,And his mother came from a family of farmers called the McDonald's.
00:23:44,00:23:45,The McDonald's.
00:23:45,00:23:46,Not the McDonald's.
00:23:46,00:23:47,"Well, the McDonald's."
00:23:47,00:23:48,Then there's got his McDonald's.
00:23:48,00:23:49,The Scottish McDonald's.
00:23:49,00:23:50,Not the chain McDonald's.
00:23:50,00:23:54,"No, and not from the old McDonald's had a farm story."
00:23:54,00:23:56,Farming dynasty.
00:23:56,00:24:01,"From the Scottish McDonald's, and his father was a Campbell."
00:24:01,00:24:06,"Okay, so the Campbell's and the McDonald's, bit of a tough time, but since the massacre"
00:24:06,00:24:12,"of Glencoe between those two families, and so he had to find an explanation for his family,"
00:24:12,00:24:19,"and he found an ancestor who had been a piper for both the Campbell's and the McDonald's,"
00:24:19,00:24:21,who was one of his ancestors.
00:24:21,00:24:25,"And so actually he could say, well, you know, we were together back then and we're together"
00:24:25,00:24:26,again now.
00:24:26,00:24:27,That's very nice.
00:24:27,00:24:31,"And apparently, and this was in the article in the BBC, they said that the piper's in"
00:24:31,00:24:35,those days were so important in the clan system that a really good one would transfer
00:24:35,00:24:39,"between clans, like a modern footballer would transfer between football teams."
00:24:39,00:24:40,Amazing.
00:24:40,00:24:41,Isn't that incredible?
00:24:41,00:24:42,So cool.
00:24:42,00:24:45,"Having listened to enough bankpipes in my time, I think they were thrusting them on"
00:24:45,00:24:46,each other.
00:24:46,00:24:47,"You take it, honestly."
00:24:47,00:24:50,"Sorry, was he called Ronny the Crofter?"
00:24:50,00:24:51,"Ronny the Crofter, yeah."
00:24:51,00:24:54,We're saying he was called Ronald McDonald.
00:24:54,00:24:58,Did he raise cows?
00:24:58,00:25:05,"It doesn't say what his actual surname was, but it perhaps he was a cowboy."
00:25:05,00:25:10,But he had two uncles who are archbishops of Glasgow.
00:25:10,00:25:15,"His grandmother was a close relation to Saint Murray McKillop, who was the first Australian"
00:25:15,00:25:16,saint.
00:25:16,00:25:17,He was a shinty champion.
00:25:17,00:25:19,He was a champion she-ra.
00:25:19,00:25:24,"He never married, but he said those who were desirable were not available and those who"
00:25:24,00:25:26,were available were not desirable.
00:25:26,00:25:27,E.I.
00:25:27,00:25:41,"O.K., it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy."
00:25:41,00:25:45,My fact is that The Rolling Stones' latest tour was sponsored by a retirement planning
00:25:45,00:25:46,organisation.
00:25:46,00:25:49,"They're so, so old now."
00:25:49,00:25:55,"Surely the main audience of The Rolling Stones is, I'm sorry to say, too late to be planning"
00:25:55,00:25:56,their retirement.
00:25:56,00:25:57,You're right.
00:25:57,00:25:59,"God, that's a good point."
00:25:59,00:26:03,"You know, when you watch daytime TV and all the adverts are like, ""Don't forget your"
00:26:03,00:26:08,"will, guys,"" or, you know, ""This donkey sanctuary would really be helped if you left"
00:26:08,00:26:09,"it some money."""
00:26:09,00:26:12,"It's basically like a big version of that, but in Wembley Stadium or wherever it is."
00:26:12,00:26:14,So this is their most recent tour.
00:26:14,00:26:17,So there's a group called The Alliance for Lifetime Income.
00:26:17,00:26:20,It basically is a non-profit and it's formed to raise awareness about the need to protect
00:26:20,00:26:26,your income in retirement by getting an annuity.
00:26:26,00:26:28,"They actually, I really like this detail."
00:26:28,00:26:32,"So they, you know, sponsored the whole thing because The Rolling Stones' audience had lots"
00:26:32,00:26:37,"of fans who were up to the age of 75, many who were over, but they thought this is perfect"
00:26:37,00:26:42,to spread their message and they sent along a bus to the events where you could get your
00:26:42,00:26:46,retirement income security evaluation showing how well you'd be covered in retirement at
00:26:46,00:26:47,the gig.
00:26:47,00:26:48,That's great.
00:26:48,00:26:50,"I mean, I love it."
00:26:50,00:26:56,"So this was the no-filter tour, it's called, and it's pretty amazing to see how much money"
00:26:56,00:26:58,the Stones are still generating.
00:26:58,00:27:02,There's a big list of like most successful tours of all time and this tour is in the
00:27:02,00:27:03,top 10.
00:27:03,00:27:04,Really?
00:27:04,00:27:07,This late in their career is in the top 10.
00:27:07,00:27:10,"So they don't need to worry too much, really, about their own retirement savings, given"
00:27:10,00:27:13,that they're all about 95 and they're still working.
00:27:13,00:27:15,"Multi-hundred millionaires, yeah."
00:27:15,00:27:18,And who haven't paid any tax on any of their earnings for the last 30 years?
00:27:18,00:27:23,"Oh, look, they moved to France for a very good reason in the 70s, rates were very high."
00:27:23,00:27:27,"The Stones have always done this sort of corporate sponsorship commercial stuff, like way ahead"
00:27:27,00:27:33,"of other bands and things like this, so in 2003 they were sponsored by T-Mobile, in 1981"
00:27:33,00:27:38,"they were sponsored by Joven Musk, which was a fragrance firm, and like way, like way, way"
00:27:38,00:27:39,back.
00:27:39,00:27:43,"Well, didn't they start out doing a jingle for Rice Krispies as well?"
00:27:43,00:27:45,"They didn't start out doing that, but they did it very early on."
00:27:45,00:27:46,Very early on there.
00:27:46,00:27:47,It was like in 1964.
00:27:47,00:27:50,"The first gig was in 1962, and then quite a, so yeah."
00:27:50,00:27:54,"Because Mick Jagger went to London School of Economics, didn't he?"
00:27:54,00:27:55,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:27:55,00:27:56,"So yeah, he was quite..."
00:27:56,00:27:59,"And did finance and accounting, I think, something did a module in it, and did pretty"
00:27:59,00:28:02,"badly and didn't do any work, but clearly picked up something."
00:28:02,00:28:03,"Yeah, yeah."
00:28:03,00:28:08,His tutor said in the first year he got straight Cs in all of his subjects because he wasn't
00:28:08,00:28:10,really paying that much attention.
00:28:10,00:28:14,But the next year he did come back and do his resets and like went to the library and
00:28:14,00:28:18,"properly studied and stuff like that, because it was only when they got the first contract"
00:28:18,00:28:21,to record a first single that he completely gave it up.
00:28:21,00:28:25,He still kind of thought he might go into finance at that stage.
00:28:25,00:28:26,"God, that's interesting."
00:28:26,00:28:30,"So he kind of moved from Class C to Class A is what you're saying, which mirrors the"
00:28:30,00:28:32,other journey they went on as well.
00:28:32,00:28:36,"There was quite a nice interview with the guy who was their accountant back then, guy"
00:28:36,00:28:37,called Lawrence Myers.
00:28:37,00:28:40,"And he said he remembered talking to Mick Jagger when they were in their 20s, and Mick"
00:28:40,00:28:44,"Jagger being really worried then about getting a pension and saying, you know, I need to"
00:28:44,00:28:47,"start saving for my retirement, because who knows where I'll be."
00:28:47,00:28:49,"And he said he remembers a phrase Mick Jagger saying, I'm not exactly going to be playing"
00:28:49,00:28:51,"rock and roll in my 60s, am I?"
00:28:51,00:28:55,And then finding it the most hilarious idea that he would be.
00:28:55,00:28:56,And the man is now 78.
00:28:56,00:28:57,Yeah.
00:28:57,00:28:58,They're so old.
00:28:58,00:28:59,They're so...
00:28:59,00:29:02,"I mean, the three surviving key ones, I think there are about 200 between them."
00:29:02,00:29:03,"No, more than..."
00:29:03,00:29:04,Really?
00:29:04,00:29:05,Are they?
00:29:05,00:29:06,Right.
00:29:06,00:29:07,Mick and Keith are both nearly 80.
00:29:07,00:29:08,Yeah.
00:29:08,00:29:10,"And Ronnie Wood, who's the new boy, because he's only been on the band for 40 years."
00:29:10,00:29:12,He's never quite fit in.
00:29:12,00:29:13,"Basically, yeah."
00:29:13,00:29:16,"I mean, they have this combination of being obviously quite cool, greatest rock and roll"
00:29:16,00:29:19,"band in the world, blah, blah, blah, and powerfully naff."
00:29:19,00:29:20,Yes.
00:29:20,00:29:23,There are so many incredibly boring things about them.
00:29:23,00:29:29,"So, for example, Charlie Watts, their drummer who died a year ago, he was incredibly dull"
00:29:29,00:29:30,in multiple different ways.
00:29:30,00:29:32,"Like, he made a study of it."
00:29:32,00:29:34,"He wasn't really interested in rock and roll music, for one thing."
00:29:34,00:29:37,"He liked jazz, and he had his own jazz band and, you know, did that."
00:29:37,00:29:39,"He wasn't necessarily dull, if you like jazz."
00:29:39,00:29:40,Very good point.
00:29:40,00:29:41,Very good point.
00:29:41,00:29:42,Sorry.
00:29:42,00:29:43,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:29:43,00:29:44,"Okay, okay."
00:29:44,00:29:45,All right.
00:29:45,00:29:46,That's just a warmer.
00:29:46,00:29:47,That's the start of the day.
00:29:47,00:29:48,"When they went on tour, what's the classic thing a rock band will do to their hotel room?"
00:29:48,00:29:49,Throw TVs out of the window.
00:29:49,00:29:50,Absolutely.
00:29:50,00:29:51,Tear it up.
00:29:51,00:29:52,Yeah.
00:29:52,00:29:54,He would draw his room on tour.
00:29:54,00:29:58,He would produce an accurate drawing of every single room he stayed on on tour for
00:29:58,00:29:59,about 50 years.
00:29:59,00:30:01,I think it was specifically the beds.
00:30:01,00:30:05,"He was obsessed with the beds of every hotel room that he stayed in, and he said that basically"
00:30:05,00:30:11,"up until his death, he's had like 15 journals worth of, you know, they did like 2,000 gigs."
00:30:11,00:30:15,"He did every single bed, and he felt like if he didn't draw the bed, something was"
00:30:15,00:30:17,"a skew in his life, and it just, it was out of whack."
00:30:17,00:30:20,"Once you've seen one bed, I feel like you've seen them all."
00:30:20,00:30:24,"Well, he would agree, because he said, ""I have all these hotel rooms recorded."""
00:30:24,00:30:27,"He did all the hotel rooms, but he definitely did the bed every time, but he would often"
00:30:27,00:30:28,do the whole lodgings.
00:30:28,00:30:33,"But he said, ""You've got Washington in '67, and then you got Washington from a couple"
00:30:33,00:30:35,"of years ago, and they're kind of the same."""
00:30:35,00:30:41,"I was reading a piece about it, and it said, ""The 15 notebooks full of drawings of beds"
00:30:41,00:30:42,"by Charlie Watts."""
00:30:42,00:30:45,"And the person who was writing the article said, ""I mean, are there any publishers reading"
00:30:45,00:30:46,this?
00:30:46,00:30:47,"We've got to get these printed."""
00:30:47,00:30:48,Oh my God.
00:30:48,00:30:49,"No, you don't."
00:30:49,00:30:50,"Come on, they'd say like wildfire."
00:30:50,00:30:52,"Here's what I want to know, though, and I couldn't find this out."
00:30:52,00:30:53,He passed away in hospital.
00:30:53,00:30:54,Yeah.
00:30:54,00:30:55,In a bed.
00:30:55,00:30:56,"Oh, stop."
00:30:56,00:30:57,I bet he didn't have time to draw the bed.
00:30:57,00:30:58,"I just want to know, did he draw the final bed?"
00:30:58,00:31:00,Do we have the final Charlie Watts bed?
00:31:00,00:31:02,"I hope somebody did, if he didn't."
00:31:02,00:31:07,"With him finally in it, Charlie Watts finally lying in his bed."
00:31:07,00:31:10,"I like to think, I hope he did trash the rooms afterwards because I like to think he'd trash"
00:31:10,00:31:12,the room completely.
00:31:12,00:31:14,"And then, as he's checking out, he went, ""I've trashed the room, but here's exactly"
00:31:14,00:31:18,"what it looked like."""
00:31:18,00:31:22,So another thing of Charlie Watts is that he used to have all these amazing cars.
00:31:22,00:31:23,It was a hobby.
00:31:23,00:31:26,"He would collect all these cars, really expensive, but he didn't have a driver's license."
00:31:26,00:31:30,"So they just used to sit in his garage, but what he used to do is he would commission"
00:31:30,00:31:34,a suit that matched the car in its color.
00:31:34,00:31:39,"And he would just go sit in his garage, in his suit, in the car, and just go, ""Broom."""
00:31:39,00:31:41,And just play with it for a bit.
00:31:41,00:31:44,"And that's what you do with all your tax-avoided money, isn't it?"
00:31:44,00:31:48,Why is there a car you can't drive?
00:31:48,00:31:52,"He didn't like the drums even, or he didn't like practicing the drums, and in fact, just"
00:31:52,00:31:53,didn't do it.
00:31:53,00:31:57,There's quite a charming interview with him where he was asked if he ever practiced himself
00:31:57,00:32:00,"on the drums, and he was like, ""God, no, I'd never practiced the drums."
00:32:00,00:32:02,"Playing the drums is so bloody boring."""
00:32:02,00:32:04,"And he said, ""It's really dull playing the drums."
00:32:04,00:32:05,He's scared of the drums.
00:32:05,00:32:06,He thinks they're too loud.
00:32:06,00:32:07,"He's scared of the drums."""
00:32:07,00:32:10,"His life reads like a tragedy, really."
00:32:10,00:32:15,"You know, you become incredibly famous and successful doing something you fear and hate."
00:32:15,00:32:20,"Imagine that every time he was like, ""Boom."""
00:32:20,00:32:23,He started life as a banjo player.
00:32:23,00:32:27,He was given a banjo to play.
00:32:27,00:32:28,Has anyone tried to play a banjo?
00:32:28,00:32:33,"By the way, it was really, really hard to play banjo, and he found it also hard."
00:32:33,00:32:38,"He couldn't work out the fingerings, and so he kind of broke up his banjo, and with his"
00:32:38,00:32:43,"broken banjo and a Meccano set, he made his first drum kit, which is how he learned the"
00:32:43,00:32:44,drums.
00:32:44,00:32:45,"Oh, wow."
00:32:45,00:32:48,"That's quite cool, because on quite a few of the big Stones tracks, he plays a kid's"
00:32:48,00:32:50,drum instead of using actual drums.
00:32:50,00:32:51,I can't remember which.
00:32:51,00:32:52,"Yeah, the massive tracks."
00:32:52,00:32:53,I can't remember the names of them.
00:32:53,00:32:56,"That's cool, because he said the only way he ever did practice was playing with heavy"
00:32:56,00:32:58,sticks just on his legs.
00:32:58,00:33:01,So maybe he loved playing drums that aren't real drums.
00:33:01,00:33:02,"Sorry, he beat himself on the legs."
00:33:02,00:33:04,"Yeah, he can't walk now, actually."
00:33:04,00:33:05,Don't do this.
00:33:05,00:33:06,He's so scared of drums.
00:33:06,00:33:07,He definitely can't walk now.
00:33:07,00:33:11,He can't walk now.
00:33:11,00:33:16,"My landlord used to be Mick Jagger's old flatmate, and it's just, there is a bit of"
00:33:16,00:33:21,"a celeb connection, which is that my landlord is Tim Henman's dad."
00:33:21,00:33:26,"So, Tim Henman's dad and Mick Jagger used to live with each other in Richmond, I think"
00:33:26,00:33:27,it was.
00:33:27,00:33:31,"The stories they must have had to say to each other, Tim Henman, I guess, wasn't born"
00:33:31,00:33:32,at the time.
00:33:32,00:33:33,No.
00:33:33,00:33:34,No.
00:33:34,00:33:35,But I bet they still found a lot to talk about.
00:33:35,00:33:36,Absolutely.
00:33:36,00:33:37,Yeah.
00:33:37,00:33:38,That's not the most.
00:33:38,00:33:39,That is very...
00:33:39,00:33:40,What?
00:33:40,00:33:41,Your old landlord.
00:33:41,00:33:42,Your old landlord.
00:33:42,00:33:43,Was Tim Henman's dad as well?
00:33:43,00:33:45,I can't believe I didn't know that.
00:33:45,00:33:46,That's...
00:33:46,00:33:47,You've been holding that fact out for the last eight years.
00:33:47,00:33:48,I think you've told us that before.
00:33:48,00:33:49,I think I have.
00:33:49,00:33:50,Yeah.
00:33:50,00:33:53,I think I must have found it too exciting and deliberately forgotten it because I wouldn't
00:33:53,00:33:54,have been able to look it down the same way again.
00:33:54,00:33:58,"I'm actually shaking a bit, just being on the same room as a guy who once paid rent"
00:33:58,00:34:02,"to the father of former British number one, Tim Henman."
00:34:02,00:34:05,"I'm shaking a bit, but the bit that's shaking is my head."
00:34:05,00:34:07,That's a true story.
00:34:07,00:34:11,There used to be a very huge thing in bands about eating on stage.
00:34:11,00:34:14,"So during the Rolling Stones' first ever gig, Ian Stewart is kind of the sixth member of"
00:34:14,00:34:17,"the Rolling Stones, but he's never been one of the front line-up, but he played with them"
00:34:17,00:34:18,decades and decades.
00:34:18,00:34:22,"At their first gig in 1962, which was in a club on Oxford Street, he was playing the"
00:34:22,00:34:25,piano with one hand and eating a pork pie with the other.
00:34:25,00:34:29,"It's not a very complex piano part, is it, if you can do the pork pie with the other hand?"
00:34:29,00:34:31,You know when you play chopsticks and two of you can play at the same time.
00:34:31,00:34:35,"Oh, you think he had someone else's hand, someone else was eating a prawn sandwich whilst"
00:34:35,00:34:37,playing the left hand.
00:34:37,00:34:38,Interesting.
00:34:38,00:34:41,"Actually, there was quite a lot of do-do-do-do-do-do-do."
00:34:41,00:34:42,Single-handed piano going on.
00:34:42,00:34:43,"Well, there you go."
00:34:43,00:34:44,Must be the pork pie in the other.
00:34:44,00:34:48,But the Beatles used to eat jam sandwiches on stage.
00:34:48,00:34:52,"And then their manager, Brian Epstein, told them, ""You have to stop eating jam sandwiches"
00:34:52,00:34:53,"on stage."""
00:34:53,00:34:54,Was that in Berlin?
00:34:54,00:34:55,"Sorry, in Hamburg."
00:34:55,00:34:56,That's pre-that.
00:34:56,00:34:57,"So it was just like, this looked quite unprofessional voice."
00:34:57,00:35:01,"But that was the same way as Bob Marley had his sandwiches, wasn't it?"
00:35:01,00:35:03,"Oh, my God."
00:35:03,00:35:04,Lovely.
00:35:04,00:35:05,We're jamming.
00:35:05,00:35:06,Yes.
00:35:06,00:35:07,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:35:07,00:35:08,Amazing.
00:35:08,00:35:09,"Oh, my God."
00:35:09,00:35:10,"Just for the dads, for the dads for listening."
00:35:10,00:35:14,"Actually, speaking of Bob Marley, I was looking into people who were connected."
00:35:14,00:35:17,They were connected as staff of the Rolling Stones off the back of the fact that they
00:35:17,00:35:20,had such a good financial package set up for them.
00:35:20,00:35:23,And just to see if any of them had gone on to anything interesting.
00:35:23,00:35:28,And found this guy who used to work as private security for the Rolling Stones in the '60s.
00:35:28,00:35:31,"Never permanently, he just had worked for them time to time."
00:35:31,00:35:33,Like an investigator?
00:35:33,00:35:37,"No, as in like a bouncer or anything."
00:35:37,00:35:40,And his name was Judge Dredd.
00:35:40,00:35:43,"And obviously not his real name, Alexander Minto Hughes is his real name."
00:35:43,00:35:46,"But he went under the name Judge Dredd, which was his later career, which was, he was an"
00:35:46,00:35:51,"English reggae and ska musician, and he was the first ever white guy to have a hit for"
00:35:51,00:35:53,reggae in Jamaica.
00:35:53,00:35:54,First guy ever.
00:35:54,00:35:57,And he was massive there and he went over to tour and they had no idea that he was white
00:35:57,00:35:58,when he got there.
00:35:58,00:36:00,"So they were like, my God, who's this, who's this incredible guy?"
00:36:00,00:36:04,He had more band songs on the BBC than anyone else ever before.
00:36:04,00:36:07,"So he was, he was the bouncer for the Stones."
00:36:07,00:36:08,Cool.
00:36:08,00:36:09,And he went on to that after.
00:36:09,00:36:10,That's good.
00:36:10,00:36:12,My formal ad-law was Tim Hedlitz.
00:36:12,00:36:17,I lived in Tim Hedlitz's childhood room.
00:36:17,00:36:18,That was my room.
00:36:18,00:36:19,"Oh, God."
00:36:19,00:36:21,And they preserved it exactly the way it had been.
00:36:21,00:36:22,Yes.
00:36:22,00:36:23,"You weren't allowed to take the posters down, were you?"
00:36:23,00:36:26,"No, it was a drawing by Charlie Watts of what it used to look like."
00:36:26,00:36:33,It was trash by the time I got there.
00:36:33,00:36:35,"Okay, it's time for the final fact of the show."
00:36:35,00:36:36,And that leaves me.
00:36:36,00:36:41,My fact this week is that clowns can spot amateur clowns by the amount of makeup that
00:36:41,00:36:43,they put around their mouths.
00:36:43,00:36:45,Too much or too little?
00:36:45,00:36:48,Too much is the problem.
00:36:48,00:36:54,"An amateur clown will do up the top lip with white, with red, with black, they'll do the"
00:36:54,00:36:56,whole mouth.
00:36:56,00:37:00,"And the professional clowns, they refer to this as a busted asshole."
00:37:00,00:37:02,That's an incredibly upsetting phrase.
00:37:02,00:37:06,"And I wish it was the first time it had even been on this podcast, but it's not."
00:37:06,00:37:07,Is it?
00:37:07,00:37:08,What?
00:37:08,00:37:10,"Because, you know, you've got to check the archive of what we've said before on the podcast."
00:37:10,00:37:11,"Yes, so that we don't repeat anything."
00:37:11,00:37:12,"Well, exactly."
00:37:12,00:37:15,"Well, fortunately, we're not repeating this fact, but it's just the second use of the"
00:37:15,00:37:16,"phrase, because..."
00:37:16,00:37:17,"Oh, God, do we guess?"
00:37:17,00:37:18,When have we said 'busted on' before?
00:37:18,00:37:19,I remember it now.
00:37:19,00:37:20,I'm trying to remember what it was.
00:37:20,00:37:24,It's not the ladies with the rectum that was...
00:37:24,00:37:25,"No, it's not the ox rectum."
00:37:25,00:37:26,That was the name.
00:37:26,00:37:28,"I think it was someone said, it was like a quote from someone."
00:37:28,00:37:29,"Oh, yes."
00:37:29,00:37:30,It's a phrase.
00:37:30,00:37:31,That's right.
00:37:31,00:37:32,It's a phrase.
00:37:32,00:37:35,It's not as much use as a hat full of busted-out holes.
00:37:35,00:37:36,"Oh, that's right."
00:37:36,00:37:37,Who is that by?
00:37:37,00:37:38,I can't remember.
00:37:38,00:37:39,"Oh, OK."
00:37:39,00:37:43,Were they referring to a fake clown man?
00:37:43,00:37:47,"So I got this fact from a book called 'God Know' by Pen Gillette, pen of pen and teller."
00:37:47,00:37:51,"So it's all about his life as a magician, how he got to be, who he was, and one of the things"
00:37:51,00:37:52,that he did when he was coming up...
00:37:52,00:37:53,His name is Pen.
00:37:53,00:37:56,He must have been able to think of a better name for his memoir.
00:37:56,00:37:57,I like God Know.
00:37:57,00:37:58,From the pen of pen.
00:37:58,00:37:59,Yes.
00:37:59,00:38:00,"Like, for instance."
00:38:00,00:38:01,You're right.
00:38:01,00:38:03,"Pen Gillette, the best a man can get."
00:38:03,00:38:04,Yes.
00:38:04,00:38:06,That's another one.
00:38:06,00:38:07,Yeah.
00:38:07,00:38:12,"So he failed title-wise, but the content is quite good."
00:38:12,00:38:15,He went as a teenager or late teen.
00:38:15,00:38:19,He went into the Ringling Brothers in Barnum and Bailey Greater Show on Earth Clown College.
00:38:19,00:38:21,And that was in Florida.
00:38:21,00:38:24,And he started doing classes in trapeze and all that stuff.
00:38:24,00:38:26,And he really sucked at physical comedy.
00:38:26,00:38:27,He didn't like it at all.
00:38:27,00:38:28,He learned how to be a clown.
00:38:28,00:38:32,"In the process of being taught how to be a clown, you learn that there's certain things"
00:38:32,00:38:35,that you should and shouldn't do if you want to really get it right.
00:38:35,00:38:38,And one of the things that they do say is that if you put makeup on the top of your
00:38:38,00:38:42,"lip, you're effectively closing off emotion in a really interesting..."
00:38:42,00:38:43,It's interesting.
00:38:43,00:38:44,Yeah.
00:38:44,00:38:48,"So by leaving that empty, you can get more out of a clown's face."
00:38:48,00:38:50,"Whereas an amateur clown just thinks, ""I've just got to cake the whole thing."""
00:38:50,00:38:51,And is that...
00:38:51,00:38:55,"Because Ronald McDonald, I think, does it wrong then in my memory?"
00:38:55,00:38:56,It's just died.
00:38:56,00:38:57,The poor guy.
00:38:57,00:38:58,The poor crofter.
00:38:58,00:39:02,"No, I think, doesn't he have a busted ass or Ronald McDonald?"
00:39:02,00:39:03,He does.
00:39:03,00:39:04,"Oh, my God."
00:39:04,00:39:05,Absolutely.
00:39:05,00:39:08,"Well, the legal letters will be flooding their way in."
00:39:08,00:39:09,Poor houses.
00:39:09,00:39:16,"Well, the area of clown IP is quite interesting because it's sort of mostly egg-based."
00:39:16,00:39:21,It seems the way that clown makeup is registered is on eggs.
00:39:21,00:39:26,"And this was a thing that was started in 1946 by a guy called Stan Bolt, who wasn't"
00:39:26,00:39:27,a clown.
00:39:27,00:39:32,"He was a chemist, oddly, and he started, you know, when you blow eggs."
00:39:32,00:39:34,So I suppose that's sort of adjacent to chemistry.
00:39:34,00:39:36,So you've been blowing the insides out of the eggs?
00:39:36,00:39:37,Yep.
00:39:37,00:39:39,"We're hollowing out, blowing out the inside of an egg."
00:39:39,00:39:43,And then he started painting faces of prominent clowns on these eggs as kind of a hobby.
00:39:43,00:39:46,And then he developed this huge file of clown faces.
00:39:46,00:39:48,And all of their makeup is completely different.
00:39:48,00:39:51,"I always thought, Stan and the clown, they all look the same."
00:39:51,00:39:54,"I'm embarrassing now that I thought that because if you look at the egg collection, they all"
00:39:54,00:39:56,look completely different.
00:39:56,00:40:02,"And actually there's a suitcase of hollowed-out egg faces that he painted that still exists,"
00:40:02,00:40:03,which is quite impressive.
00:40:03,00:40:05,"It still exists in London, doesn't it?"
00:40:05,00:40:06,Exactly.
00:40:06,00:40:07,The collection still exists in London.
00:40:07,00:40:13,"It does exist in London, but it used to be held in a, it was in a museum, wasn't it?"
00:40:13,00:40:18,And I think it was only once a month it would open because of the costs of keeping it going.
00:40:18,00:40:20,But now it's not even there anymore.
00:40:20,00:40:22,There was a flood in the museum.
00:40:22,00:40:27,"And the clown faces, the eggs are kept in the basement of this guy in Clarkhamwell,"
00:40:27,00:40:29,who was the archivist of the museum.
00:40:29,00:40:30,Are you serious?
00:40:30,00:40:32,There's been a terrible flood.
00:40:32,00:40:34,"So as a result, we've moved them to a basement."
00:40:34,00:40:37,Put them in the attic.
00:40:37,00:40:38,"Yeah, really good point."
00:40:38,00:40:42,"He probably lives in the ground four flat, I don't know."
00:40:42,00:40:46,"But yeah, apparently during lockdown, he kind of got through it by going checking all of"
00:40:46,00:40:48,his archives from the clown museum.
00:40:48,00:40:50,That's how he got through in lockdown.
00:40:50,00:40:55,Seeing a cupboard with a thousand creepy painted eggs living there.
00:40:55,00:40:56,It gets worse.
00:40:56,00:41:02,"He also has 47 clown costumes and 20 pairs of clown shoes, which he would go and look"
00:41:02,00:41:04,at from time to time.
00:41:04,00:41:08,"But he said in an interview, ""The only reason you get clown shoes in a museum is because"
00:41:08,00:41:10,"the clown who wore them has died."""
00:41:10,00:41:14,Ernest Hemingway was once asked to write the saddest poem he could with six words and it
00:41:14,00:41:19,"was, ""For sale, clown shoes, too big."""
00:41:19,00:41:22,Have any of you guys been to clown school?
00:41:22,00:41:25,"No, but you have, I have."
00:41:25,00:41:28,Just in case one of you guys had also been present and I hadn't noticed.
00:41:28,00:41:30,It was a horrible experience.
00:41:30,00:41:31,Is it?
00:41:31,00:41:32,Yeah.
00:41:32,00:41:33,Why?
00:41:33,00:41:36,"It's not clowns as in, you know, like big shoes and tiny cars, it's a different type"
00:41:36,00:41:37,of clown school.
00:41:37,00:41:38,No.
00:41:38,00:41:45,"It's the sort of upsetting Gaulier-Lacoc, the master will break you down and then rebuild"
00:41:45,00:41:46,you thing.
00:41:46,00:41:48,Like learning to fall over and stuff.
00:41:48,00:41:53,"No, no, none of that, no, no, you get horribly insulted by the instructor."
00:41:53,00:41:56,"They're trying to work out who your comedy character is, is that right?"
00:41:56,00:41:57,"A little bit, yeah."
00:41:57,00:41:59,And you are arriving in a tiny car.
00:41:59,00:42:03,That's the airport pickup.
00:42:03,00:42:10,Did everyone get horribly insulted by the instructor or were you just not very good?
00:42:10,00:42:13,"There was one guy who was a bit of a teacher's pet who didn't get horribly instructed, but"
00:42:13,00:42:16,"the rest of us all got, and it was only a four-day course as well, so they had time"
00:42:16,00:42:20,"to kind of break us down very badly, but not really time to build us back up again."
00:42:20,00:42:22,"So it was four of the worst days of my life, I would say."
00:42:22,00:42:27,"They water-barred you with confetti, didn't they?"
00:42:27,00:42:31,I had to smell so many flowers.
00:42:31,00:42:38,"Have you guys heard of Lady Avetta, who was in 1895 called the only lady clown?"
00:42:38,00:42:39,"Oh, no."
00:42:39,00:42:44,"Probably wasn't the only lady clown at the time, but she was a very famous clown, and"
00:42:44,00:42:49,one of her favorite tricks was she would sit in the audience and next to some unsuspecting
00:42:49,00:42:56,"bloke, and then she would claim that that was actually her fiance and heckle the ringmaster"
00:42:56,00:42:58,"saying, ""You looking at my fiance?"""
00:42:58,00:42:59,That kind of thing.
00:42:59,00:43:04,"What I really like about her is that there's a quote from her in the New York Times, and"
00:43:04,00:43:08,"she said, ""All my people laughed at me when I told them I was going into the ring as a"
00:43:08,00:43:10,"clown, but they do not laugh now."""
00:43:10,00:43:11,Oh my god.
00:43:11,00:43:12,Isn't it?
00:43:12,00:43:13,Bob Monkhouse.
00:43:13,00:43:16,"It's supposed to be a Bob Monkhouse joke, but actually it's from 1895."
00:43:16,00:43:17,Really?
00:43:17,00:43:19,"Actually, Bob Monkhouse was so old, it was a really good joke."
00:43:19,00:43:21,He was the husband.
00:43:21,00:43:22,That's amazing.
00:43:22,00:43:24,"Yeah, isn't that cool?"
00:43:24,00:43:29,"Another female clown, Annie Fratellini, she founded the first circus school in Europe."
00:43:29,00:43:32,In 1975.
00:43:32,00:43:37,She did the full kind of Auguste clown of these.
00:43:37,00:43:41,"You've got white face, you've got the red lips and all that kind of stuff."
00:43:41,00:43:45,"When she was asked whether she was portraying a male or a female, she insisted that clowns"
00:43:45,00:43:47,have no gender.
00:43:47,00:43:51,"She founded the first circus school, so I think she is the authority on that."
00:43:51,00:43:53,"If you see a clown, you think it's a man or a woman, it's not."
00:43:53,00:43:56,It's just a clown.
00:43:56,00:44:01,"Her grandfather was Paul Fratellini, Paul Francois and Albert."
00:44:01,00:44:05,"They were famous clowns, all three of them, really, really famous clowns, and their father,"
00:44:05,00:44:11,"so her great-grandfather was Gustavo Fratellini, and he was an Italian patriot who, along with"
00:44:11,00:44:17,"Giuseppe Garibaldi, took part in the unification of Italy, but imagine unifying Italy, and"
00:44:17,00:44:19,then all of your kids are clowns.
00:44:19,00:44:21,Isn't that a weird stuff?
00:44:21,00:44:24,What was it all for?
00:44:24,00:44:25,That's amazing.
00:44:25,00:44:29,"Just on the clown sex thing, clowns don't have a sex, that does kind of make sense,"
00:44:29,00:44:33,"because otherwise you're implying the existence of clown genitalia, which is..."
00:44:33,00:44:35,And that would be what sacrilege to a clown?
00:44:35,00:44:39,"Where does the ""ha ha"" sound come from, if not from..."
00:44:39,00:44:43,"That's not them squeezing their balls, is it?"
00:44:43,00:44:44,Or vaginas.
00:44:44,00:44:51,"But they can do amazing balloon tricks, actually, that's the really clever thing."
00:44:51,00:44:57,"Henry IV of France had his life saved by a clown, by his own clown, in 1594, an assassin"
00:44:57,00:45:02,"got into his bedroom and was going to assassinate him, and he was in there with his clown."
00:45:02,00:45:03,Oh yeah.
00:45:03,00:45:04,Oh yeah.
00:45:04,00:45:05,And...
00:45:05,00:45:06,"Just testing, is it true?"
00:45:06,00:45:08,Would they say the clowns have no genitals?
00:45:08,00:45:11,Maybe we could test the theory.
00:45:11,00:45:14,Do you know what they say about men with big feet?
00:45:14,00:45:16,"There was nothing untoward going on, the clown was still in..."
00:45:16,00:45:19,How about a bust of that?
00:45:19,00:45:21,Oh wow.
00:45:21,00:45:25,No assholes were busted in the making of this.
00:45:25,00:45:26,Escapade.
00:45:26,00:45:34,"This was actually a female clown as well, she was called a maturine de Valois, and she"
00:45:34,00:45:39,"arrested the assassin and stopped the assassin leaving the room, and thus saved his life."
00:45:39,00:45:45,"I don't know how she did it, I don't know if it was confetti to the face, but yeah."
00:45:45,00:45:46,That's incredible.
00:45:46,00:45:49,And then his hand was burned with molten sulphur and lead.
00:45:49,00:45:50,Whose hand?
00:45:50,00:45:51,The assassin.
00:45:51,00:45:52,As a punishment.
00:45:52,00:45:53,As a punishment.
00:45:53,00:45:54,Because it was the hand that...
00:45:54,00:45:55,It's a punishment.
00:45:55,00:45:56,I'm wrong.
00:45:56,00:45:57,Wow.
00:45:57,00:45:58,That's crazy.
00:45:58,00:45:59,Sorry.
00:45:59,00:46:04,"Because it was the hand that touched the king, and then he was executed."
00:46:04,00:46:08,"Oh, I thought that was like a ""we'll let you off on this occasion, but we'll mess up"
00:46:08,00:46:09,"your hand."""
00:46:09,00:46:12,"No, no, it was ""we'll mess up your hand and then we'll kill you, and then we'll chop you"
00:46:12,00:46:13,"into loads of pieces."""
00:46:13,00:46:14,That was a different time.
00:46:14,00:46:18,That was okay then.
00:46:18,00:46:20,"You know they don't say ""break a leg"" in Clownland?"
00:46:20,00:46:21,Do they not?
00:46:21,00:46:22,No.
00:46:22,00:46:23,What do they say?
00:46:23,00:46:24,"They say ""bump a nose."""
00:46:24,00:46:25,"Oh, that's good."
00:46:25,00:46:26,Bump a nose.
00:46:26,00:46:27,A group of clowns together?
00:46:27,00:46:28,What are they called?
00:46:28,00:46:29,Clowntown.
00:46:29,00:46:30,"No, as in like the collective noun."
00:46:30,00:46:32,A collective noun of clowns.
00:46:32,00:46:33,Yes.
00:46:33,00:46:34,A collective clown.
00:46:34,00:46:35,A hulk of clowns?
00:46:35,00:46:36,A hulk?
00:46:36,00:46:37,A clowns?
00:46:37,00:46:38,No.
00:46:38,00:46:43,"Just like the listener, Jane's hand did go under the table now."
00:46:43,00:46:45,It's a giggle.
00:46:45,00:46:48,Like a gaggle of geese and a gaggle of clowns.
00:46:48,00:46:50,Can I tell you one clown trick?
00:46:50,00:46:56,"I was on the website of clown historian Bruce Charlie Johnson, which is an unbelievably"
00:46:56,00:46:57,good clowning site.
00:46:57,00:47:01,"It's one of those old websites which, you know, made about 15 years ago, so it looks"
00:47:01,00:47:06,"very old, but it's just full of great information, and there was a clown who told the world called"
00:47:06,00:47:09,"Adolf Proper decades and decades ago, but one of his tricks was this."
00:47:09,00:47:14,I think it's very important that we know exactly how many decades ago Adolf Proper was
00:47:14,00:47:15,storing.
00:47:15,00:47:19,Was it seven decades ago or was it nine decades ago?
00:47:19,00:47:22,"Early 20th century, as far as I'm getting."
00:47:22,00:47:23,Okay.
00:47:23,00:47:28,"But basically they had this musical comedy act, a clowning act, and he could produce"
00:47:28,00:47:30,large numbers of items from his coat.
00:47:30,00:47:31,That was the thing.
00:47:31,00:47:32,It's kind of a Mary Poppins bag.
00:47:32,00:47:33,Okay.
00:47:33,00:47:34,Get what he produced.
00:47:34,00:47:36,300 bananas.
00:47:36,00:47:42,57% of which could be peeled.
00:47:42,00:47:48,"Three watermelons, six pineapples, four oranges, 24 neckties, a broom, an oboe, 12 mandolins,"
00:47:48,00:47:54,"a cigar box, a trash can, a hatchet, a music stand, and other items."
00:47:54,00:47:55,Oh my God.
00:47:55,00:47:59,"It was what he got out of one coat, and the way he did it was they were all collapsible."
00:47:59,00:48:00,They were made from papier-mache.
00:48:00,00:48:01,Oh.
00:48:01,00:48:02,So good.
00:48:02,00:48:05,"And they were sort of intricate springs, so they all expanded whenever they were produced."
00:48:05,00:48:06,That's really clever.
00:48:06,00:48:07,That's great.
00:48:07,00:48:08,That's fabulous.
00:48:08,00:48:11,"Although I really thought, because you started with a list of fruit and then you said 24 neckties"
00:48:11,00:48:15,and I thought you thought that was the plural of nectarine.
00:48:15,00:48:16,What?
00:48:16,00:48:26,Why have I been wearing this around my neck all this time then?
00:48:26,00:48:29,"Okay, that's it."
