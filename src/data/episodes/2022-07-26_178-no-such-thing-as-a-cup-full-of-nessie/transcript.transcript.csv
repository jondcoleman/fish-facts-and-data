00:00:00,00:00:20,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:20,00:00:26,to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting
00:00:26,00:00:32,"here with James Harkin, Anna Chazinski and Andrew Hunter Murray and once again we have gathered"
00:00:32,00:00:37,around the microphones of our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular
00:00:37,00:00:42,order here we go. Starting with you Chazinski. My fact this week is that one of the costume
00:00:42,00:00:49,designers on Star Wars also made a mousse suit for scientists to help them sneak up on mousse
00:00:49,00:00:55,or mousse's. Or mousse such. Or mousse. Is mousse such the actual plural?
00:00:55,00:00:58,"Yeah, because it's a Native American word and that's how this particular tribe pluralises"
00:00:58,00:01:01,it. So what's the advantage of sneaking up on a mousse?
00:01:01,00:01:05,"Well if you want to hang out with them, which these scientists did so they were studying"
00:01:05,00:01:08,mousse in the Yellowstone area and I think there was specifically at this time looking at
00:01:08,00:01:12,"how they were responding to predators. So wolves, numbers had declined in Yellowstone and"
00:01:12,00:01:16,mousse had got used to living without them and then I think they'd come back and the scientist
00:01:16,00:01:20,wanted to see if mousse had forgotten how to escape wolves and so then you needed to put
00:01:20,00:01:27,wolf poo and we where mousse lived to check how they responded to the threat. And so this
00:01:27,00:01:32,researcher called Joel Berger asked a woman who worked on the set of Star Wars to make
00:01:32,00:01:35,him a mousse suit so we could go and deposit mousse poo and we around mousse.
00:01:35,00:01:41,"Yeah, because they did used to before the mousse suit came along, did attempt to sort of throw"
00:01:41,00:01:48,balls of poo and we out at the mousse in order to attract them towards it but they couldn't
00:01:48,00:01:51,throw far enough so they ended up just littering the landscape.
00:01:51,00:01:55,"I think they still sometimes use balls, they use snowballs so they get snowballs and they'll"
00:01:55,00:02:00,"put, sometimes they even put human we on because they want to see how they'll deal with"
00:02:00,00:02:04,humans so they'll wee on a snowball and then throw it towards the mousse.
00:02:04,00:02:07,"Yeah, that's right and they would slingshot them as well."
00:02:07,00:02:11,"And Joel Berger wrote about this, he's written a book called The Better To Eat You With and"
00:02:11,00:02:15,"he describes the moment where he first, he had his like there's a eureka moment where"
00:02:15,00:02:20,"he's in the place observing the mousse and he says to his colleague, wait I've had a brilliant"
00:02:20,00:02:24,"idea, I'm going to wee on the snowball but then he says he's run out of wee because he"
00:02:24,00:02:27,recently went to the loo so he just instead of explaining that properly.
00:02:27,00:02:35,I would say you've run out of wee again.
00:02:35,00:02:39,But his wee stockpile was depleted.
00:02:39,00:02:42,So he just made a snowball with his hands and then turned to his colleague and said quick
00:02:42,00:02:46,press on this so I can throw it at the deer.
00:02:46,00:02:49,I think his colleague is his wife is it not?
00:02:49,00:02:53,"This was a male colleague, not his wife, maybe he's got more than one colleague."
00:02:53,00:02:59,"Yeah, probably not after this experiment, probably goes through colleagues quite quickly."
00:02:59,00:03:04,I've been to Yellowstone and seen the mousse and you can drive right up to them and they just
00:03:04,00:03:05,sit there.
00:03:05,00:03:06,Oh yeah.
00:03:06,00:03:07,So I don't know why he needs to sneak up on them.
00:03:07,00:03:09,"Yeah, that's a really good point."
00:03:09,00:03:13,Are they actually yellow stones or are they urine coverage snowballs?
00:03:13,00:03:17,It was just called Stone National Park before he got that.
00:03:17,00:03:18,This is the thing.
00:03:18,00:03:22,So when they do it in the experiments with the snowballs they also use human feces and
00:03:22,00:03:27,they have to use toilet paper I think because they say well we're going to do this in a
00:03:27,00:03:30,safe by a charitable way rather than just pooing into a snowball.
00:03:30,00:03:32,"Yeah, that was interesting."
00:03:32,00:03:35,I think I would take the poo and then put the snowball around it.
00:03:35,00:03:36,That's how you do that.
00:03:36,00:03:40,Who went to the snowball?
00:03:40,00:03:42,Everyone's got different methods James and we'll see who's more effective.
00:03:42,00:03:44,I don't think you'd be very good at this Andy.
00:03:44,00:03:49,I'm lethal in a snowball fight.
00:03:49,00:03:54,You have to wait for the other team to contract dysentery now.
00:03:54,00:03:55,Meanwhile you'll be impelted.
00:03:55,00:03:59,It's a long technique James but come the next snowball match in two days they're going
00:03:59,00:04:02,to lose.
00:04:02,00:04:07,So the idea with this mousse suit is that they wanted to sneak up on the mousse in order to
00:04:07,00:04:13,get close enough by tricking the mousse into thinking they were fellow mousse.
00:04:13,00:04:19,So this is who he did do it with his wife who's written up in all the articles as miscutting
00:04:19,00:04:20,him.
00:04:20,00:04:23,So miscutting him and Dr. Burger got inside the mousse suit.
00:04:23,00:04:24,She was the back.
00:04:24,00:04:27,He was the front and they walked up to the mousse and I don't think the mousse took to them
00:04:27,00:04:29,too well from what I read.
00:04:29,00:04:35,He said it worked quite well in the anti managed five successful deposits but maybe they didn't
00:04:35,00:04:36,like it at first.
00:04:36,00:04:41,Did they make it realistic as in did they push the real wolf droppings that they were testing
00:04:41,00:04:43,the mousse with out of the back end of their costume mousse?
00:04:43,00:04:48,No because they don't want the mousse to think that wolves look like mousse.
00:04:48,00:04:50,All wolves come disguised as mousse.
00:04:50,00:04:53,Yeah to wolf in mousse clothing.
00:04:53,00:04:59,So the mousse have a saying is just a human in mousse clothing to mean and who's shitting
00:04:59,00:05:00,wolf shit.
00:05:00,00:05:04,This is just a way to really confuse a lot of mousse isn't it?
00:05:04,00:05:05,Yeah.
00:05:05,00:05:07,But the mousse wouldn't be able to make the connection between the poo they'd seen coming
00:05:07,00:05:09,out and think smell it and think oh that's what that's.
00:05:09,00:05:10,Of course they would.
00:05:10,00:05:13,Now that's what animals do all the time.
00:05:13,00:05:17,Animals are always smelling poo's and being able to recognise other animals.
00:05:17,00:05:21,But they I don't think that a mousse is clever enough I'm sorry if this is slundering the
00:05:21,00:05:26,mousse community to see a scientist dressed as a mousse pushing a wolf poo out of a fake
00:05:26,00:05:30,mousse costume and then go over and sniff it and think that's a dangerous animal.
00:05:30,00:05:33,But do you not see that they might be confused?
00:05:33,00:05:36,I can see they might be confused.
00:05:36,00:05:38,No one's debating that.
00:05:38,00:05:39,That was fair.
00:05:39,00:05:44,But this is so you ask if this was realistic and I guess she was quite a good costume designer
00:05:44,00:05:50,castles is quite big but it was made of styrofoam and cloth and a lot of them seemed to
00:05:50,00:05:51,made of styrofoam.
00:05:51,00:05:55,So scientists quite often want to sneak up on animals for various reasons and styrofoam
00:05:55,00:05:58,seems to be the material of choice.
00:05:58,00:06:04,So someone this year in Montana dressed up as a grizzly bear in Glacier National Park
00:06:04,00:06:08,in Montana to try and scare mountain goats and again styrofoam costume.
00:06:08,00:06:09,Right.
00:06:09,00:06:12,And is that to train the goats to be afraid of bears?
00:06:12,00:06:13,Yes.
00:06:13,00:06:14,Wow.
00:06:14,00:06:15,That's good.
00:06:15,00:06:19,It's because do you know why they've stopped being afraid of predators generally?
00:06:19,00:06:20,Sorry.
00:06:20,00:06:21,What animals we talk about here?
00:06:21,00:06:22,This is mountain goats.
00:06:22,00:06:24,Is it because there aren't enough predators around to be afraid of?
00:06:24,00:06:27,We're back on urine and feces.
00:06:27,00:06:29,It's due to human urine.
00:06:29,00:06:34,So there was a piece of the New York Times last week about how in this National Park all
00:06:34,00:06:38,the mountain goats are flocking towards where humans go because they we along all the tracking
00:06:38,00:06:41,tracks and the we's full of salt and goats love salt.
00:06:41,00:06:44,So human urine creates salt licks.
00:06:44,00:06:47,And so now they're just stopping nervous about predators because they spend so much time
00:06:47,00:06:48,around humans.
00:06:48,00:06:49,So how do they scare them?
00:06:49,00:06:53,They just run up to them and so they rip them apart with their bear costume hands.
00:06:53,00:06:54,That's not scaring.
00:06:54,00:06:55,That is scary.
00:06:55,00:06:56,That is scary.
00:06:56,00:06:58,You wouldn't say terrible news.
00:06:58,00:07:02,Someone recently got scared by a bear and then you read the small print in terms of they
00:07:02,00:07:04,got torn to pieces by it.
00:07:04,00:07:06,But it's poorer on coragelezotra.
00:07:06,00:07:09,All the other goats would be very scared.
00:07:09,00:07:10,That's true.
00:07:10,00:07:11,Yeah.
00:07:11,00:07:12,If you invited all the goats to an event.
00:07:12,00:07:13,Yeah.
00:07:13,00:07:15,So there's going to be a massive urine lump for you to alter lick and then a bear turns
00:07:15,00:07:17,up and rips the goat to pieces.
00:07:17,00:07:22,You stop licking urine lumps and also sorry is poor on coragelezotra real phrase that people
00:07:22,00:07:23,use.
00:07:23,00:07:25,I was quite scared by that phrase.
00:07:25,00:07:26,Yeah me too.
00:07:26,00:07:28,I thought you just messed up what you were saying but you carried on.
00:07:28,00:07:31,I was going to address it after the podcast.
00:07:31,00:07:34,You're right mate.
00:07:34,00:07:35,It's a French phrase.
00:07:35,00:07:37,It's obviously a French phrase.
00:07:37,00:07:38,It's an English podcast.
00:07:38,00:07:39,Yeah.
00:07:39,00:07:40,I forgot that.
00:07:40,00:07:41,Sorry.
00:07:41,00:07:42,I was thinking of my other podcast.
00:07:42,00:07:48,You're actually a Frenchman in an undecast you know.
00:07:48,00:07:49,We lost and sorry.
00:07:49,00:07:51,Do you want to tell you about poor on coragelezotra?
00:07:51,00:07:52,Oh yeah.
00:07:52,00:07:53,Sorry.
00:07:53,00:07:54,Yeah.
00:07:54,00:07:55,It's a phrase.
00:07:55,00:07:56,So let's say.
00:07:56,00:07:57,I mean we know what it means.
00:07:57,00:07:58,Oh yeah.
00:07:58,00:07:59,We know what it means.
00:07:59,00:08:00,But for the people I hope you don't.
00:08:00,00:08:04,You explain that anyway because you explain what would happen with the bear killing one goat
00:08:04,00:08:05,in there.
00:08:05,00:08:06,Yeah.
00:08:06,00:08:07,No.
00:08:07,00:08:08,But I just think Dan's being a bit cocky there.
00:08:08,00:08:10,I mean we definitely know what it means when he didn't know what language it was a second
00:08:10,00:08:11,again.
00:08:11,00:08:19,So we lost an iconic man in a suit this week.
00:08:19,00:08:26,The sad passing of a man called Haruo Nakajima who was for the first 12 Godzilla movies.
00:08:26,00:08:27,Godzilla.
00:08:27,00:08:28,Oh.
00:08:28,00:08:29,Spent the first...
00:08:29,00:08:30,The wall.
00:08:30,00:08:33,Spent a large chunk of his career inside the same Godzilla suit.
00:08:33,00:08:34,So they use the same actor.
00:08:34,00:08:38,"He's like Andy Circus for the Lord of the Rings trilogy, you know."
00:08:38,00:08:40,He's just used as the CGI guy.
00:08:40,00:08:42,He was the same guy in every suit.
00:08:42,00:08:47,My face then when you said Andy Circus in Lord of the Rings was the same as your face where
00:08:47,00:08:49,Andy said the French phrase.
00:08:49,00:08:53,Andy Circus was a golem in Lord of the Rings.
00:08:53,00:08:56,What he wasn't in a suit was he because I think I've seen clips of that.
00:08:56,00:08:57,And he's like a CGI.
00:08:57,00:08:58,He's the CGI.
00:08:58,00:08:59,Yes.
00:08:59,00:09:00,Yes.
00:09:00,00:09:01,Right.
00:09:01,00:09:03,And he also is the chief ape in the Planet of the Apes films.
00:09:03,00:09:04,Yes.
00:09:04,00:09:05,And what else did he do?
00:09:05,00:09:06,Tintin.
00:09:06,00:09:07,He's Captain Haddock.
00:09:07,00:09:11,And he's something else in King Kong.
00:09:11,00:09:12,King Kong is King Kong.
00:09:12,00:09:13,He was a Boss King Kong.
00:09:13,00:09:14,Yeah.
00:09:14,00:09:15,He didn't play Godzilla in the recent...
00:09:15,00:09:16,"No, I don't think so."
00:09:16,00:09:21,"But I would go and see a circus show, which was Andy Circus, as all the animals that Andy"
00:09:21,00:09:25,"Circus has played over the course of his career, and they're all Andy Circus in different"
00:09:25,00:09:26,costumes.
00:09:26,00:09:27,Right.
00:09:27,00:09:28,What about...
00:09:28,00:09:29,He was in a little Dorit as one of the bad guys.
00:09:29,00:09:30,Absolutely.
00:09:30,00:09:31,Would you include that?
00:09:31,00:09:32,"Yeah, 100%."
00:09:32,00:09:33,Okay.
00:09:33,00:09:39,"So this guy was famous in Japan for being Godzilla, and he was in it for 12 movies."
00:09:39,00:09:41,"He's just passed away, age 88."
00:09:41,00:09:47,"And in order for him to properly understand how Godzilla might move, he spent a lot of time"
00:09:47,00:09:52,at the zoo watching the elephants and bears to see how they walked and how they...
00:09:52,00:09:55,So he claimed that he did method acting on how Godzilla would exist.
00:09:55,00:09:56,He took it really seriously.
00:09:56,00:09:57,Wow.
00:09:57,00:09:58,"Yeah, so we lost him this week."
00:09:58,00:10:04,"A very iconic man in a suit on Star Wars as well, sort of in costume news of Star Wars."
00:10:04,00:10:10,"For a very long time, they lost Obi-Wan Kenobi's robe."
00:10:10,00:10:12,The one that Alex Guinness wears in the movies.
00:10:12,00:10:16,And so it was a shame because it's such an iconic thing that they obviously didn't realize
00:10:16,00:10:19,at the time how iconic it would become over the years.
00:10:19,00:10:25,"But it was found in 2005, and it was in the shop warehouse of this company called Angels"
00:10:25,00:10:31,that does costume lending for movies and for Halloween costumes and so on.
00:10:31,00:10:32,So Angels.
00:10:32,00:10:36,"Angels, in fact, there used to be one or so might be one, just around the corner from us."
00:10:36,00:10:43,"And yeah, they found it in there, and it spent the sort of 30 years that it's been missing,"
00:10:43,00:10:48,being rented out during a Halloween New Year or for people dressing as monks.
00:10:48,00:10:50,So it would be a fancy dress costume.
00:10:50,00:10:53,"It made it into a few movies, unknowingly, like the mummy."
00:10:53,00:10:54,It's in the mummy.
00:10:54,00:10:55,No.
00:10:55,00:10:59,"So this is in 2005, they found it again, and yeah, it was someone working."
00:10:59,00:11:02,"There was like, this feels like this is not your regular month outfit."
00:11:02,00:11:03,"Look, how did they know it was hosted?"
00:11:03,00:11:05,Have his name tag in the back.
00:11:05,00:11:07,"So, yeah, I couldn't find that detail."
00:11:07,00:11:13,"What I do know is that the creator of the costumes, the original Star Wars costume designer,"
00:11:13,00:11:15,"different to the one you're talking about, Anna."
00:11:15,00:11:19,"He verified that it was that, he said, yeah, so there must have been something on it to identify it."
00:11:19,00:11:20,Great.
00:11:20,00:11:21,"The Angels is amazing, though."
00:11:21,00:11:22,I didn't know this place exists.
00:11:22,00:11:25,It basically supplies costumes for all the best films.
00:11:25,00:11:32,"So, three of the five nominees this year for Best Costume, all the costumes came from this place Angels."
00:11:32,00:11:38,"It's been supplying Hollywood film costumes since 1940, since the 1940s."
00:11:38,00:11:43,"So I think it's first Oscar was in 1948 for Hamlet, and it's most recent as the Grand Budapest Hotel."
00:11:43,00:11:47,And it's just this one place in London that everyone goes to get costumes.
00:11:47,00:11:51,And it's supplied my costume a few years going 2012 when I went as a Mayan.
00:11:51,00:11:52,Did it?
00:11:52,00:11:53,Yeah.
00:11:53,00:11:54,"That wasn't in the article I read, actually."
00:11:54,00:11:55,No.
00:11:55,00:11:56,It will be now.
00:11:56,00:11:57,They'll do an update.
00:11:57,00:11:59,That's got to go in.
00:11:59,00:12:00,Costumes.
00:12:00,00:12:01,Yeah.
00:12:01,00:12:02,Yeah.
00:12:02,00:12:09,"Did you see in the news this week that in Game of Thrones, John Snow's cape is made out of an Ikea rug."
00:12:09,00:12:10,No.
00:12:10,00:12:13,That's so funny.
00:12:13,00:12:15,To present the Channel 4 news.
00:12:15,00:12:16,"Oh, no."
00:12:16,00:12:17,Here we go.
00:12:17,00:12:27,"It's a liberating ignorance, Fianna."
00:12:27,00:12:28,"I've never seen it, but do they all have capes with the quintessentially Ikea type patterns on them?"
00:12:28,00:12:29,Yeah.
00:12:29,00:12:30,That's the ladder that's going up the wall.
00:12:30,00:12:31,It's just a lot of billy butt cases.
00:12:31,00:12:35,"No, because there's one bit missing, and that's a key scene in the TV series."
00:12:35,00:12:40,"And the other big Game of Thrones news is that there was a big battle this week, not too"
00:12:40,00:12:44,"much for Spiler, and it featured half of all the stunt performers in the UK."
00:12:44,00:12:45,Wow.
00:12:45,00:12:52,"And most of them were set on fire, and they beat the world record for most people set on fire"
00:12:52,00:12:53,at one time.
00:12:53,00:12:54,That's amazing.
00:12:54,00:12:58,"Presumably, the officially recorded most people on fire."
00:12:58,00:13:03,"Well, Guinness doesn't recognise a record, but they, people in the industry, kind of know"
00:13:03,00:13:04,what the record was.
00:13:04,00:13:09,"They think it was, there were 13 burning actors in ""Saving Private Ryan"", and in Braveheart"
00:13:09,00:13:13,"there were 18 people who were partially burned, so they were kind of the record."
00:13:13,00:13:19,"They've gone up to 20 people set on fire at the same time, or 73 people set on fire over"
00:13:19,00:13:20,the course of a show.
00:13:20,00:13:21,Bloody hell.
00:13:21,00:13:23,Are they all okay?
00:13:23,00:13:27,"They are, but it's quite weird, because they put this gel on you, and they set fire to"
00:13:27,00:13:29,"you, and the gel kind of keeps the heat away from you."
00:13:29,00:13:32,"But you can't breathe while it's happening, otherwise you breathe in the fire."
00:13:32,00:13:36,So you have to hold your breath for like 30 seconds.
00:13:36,00:13:39,"And it's like doing an underwater scene apart from it's much more dangerous, because if"
00:13:39,00:13:41,"you breathe in, you're just going to breathe in fire."
00:13:41,00:13:42,This is insane.
00:13:42,00:13:46,Surely we have CGI that can replicate fire that doesn't involve people having to inhale
00:13:46,00:13:47,flame.
00:13:47,00:13:50,I think the old ways are the best.
00:13:50,00:13:51,Yeah.
00:13:51,00:13:53,"It's exactly the opposite of an underwater scene, James."
00:13:53,00:13:57,They're just sort of picking up on that.
00:13:57,00:13:58,Yeah.
00:13:58,00:13:59,You're right.
00:13:59,00:14:00,Yeah.
00:14:00,00:14:02,"But yeah, and the, apparently one big problem is after it's finished, after they've put"
00:14:02,00:14:06,"you out, you kind of lie on the floor, and you have to lie there for a few minutes,"
00:14:06,00:14:10,"because if you stand up, you might get re-ignited by accident, and that's one of the"
00:14:10,00:14:15,"most dangerous things, because there's a lot of fire around, and this sounds like a ridiculous"
00:14:15,00:14:16,programme.
00:14:16,00:14:19,They don't have any of that on the channel for news.
00:14:19,00:14:25,"Well, one good thing is that IKEA stuff is often flame retarded, so that might be a good,"
00:14:25,00:14:26,"you know, use for that."
00:14:26,00:14:27,That's good.
00:14:27,00:14:28,I watch one.
00:14:28,00:14:32,So John Snow could have put everyone out with his cape on my one.
00:14:32,00:14:41,"Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James."
00:14:41,00:14:46,"Okay, my fact this week is that Switzerland has 18 living ex-presidents."
00:14:46,00:14:51,"Okay, I think that's quite a lot."
00:14:51,00:14:52,It's cute.
00:14:52,00:14:53,Yeah.
00:14:53,00:14:54,Because how many ex-prime ministers do we got?
00:14:54,00:14:55,Four or five?
00:14:55,00:14:56,Yeah.
00:14:56,00:14:57,Four.
00:14:57,00:14:58,"We've got major, Blair, Brown, Cameron."
00:14:58,00:14:59,That's it.
00:14:59,00:15:00,Yeah.
00:15:00,00:15:01,Yeah.
00:15:01,00:15:02,Four.
00:15:02,00:15:07,"I want to wrap in that, it was Italy with prime ministers, looks like they've got ten who"
00:15:07,00:15:08,are still living.
00:15:08,00:15:09,"Wow, really?"
00:15:09,00:15:10,Yeah.
00:15:10,00:15:15,"But Italy goes through governments like I go through Pants, what's every couple of years?"
00:15:15,00:15:21,But with a huge amount of corruption along the way.
00:15:21,00:15:25,"But Switzerland, it is a bit of a cheat, because their presidency is very unusual, and"
00:15:25,00:15:30,"they only have like a one year president each time, and it rotates with everyone that"
00:15:30,00:15:32,who's in the cabinet.
00:15:32,00:15:37,"So all you have to do is get elected into the cabinet, and then wait your turn to everyone"
00:15:37,00:15:40,"else has become president, and then you'll automatically become president."
00:15:40,00:15:41,You're so cool.
00:15:41,00:15:45,"And also, there's no maximum number of times that you can be president, so you can just"
00:15:45,00:15:48,"sit there, and it's like the record is six times."
00:15:48,00:15:51,And there are quite a few people who are currently in the cabinet who are just waiting
00:15:51,00:15:52,for another girl.
00:15:52,00:15:53,Yeah.
00:15:53,00:15:55,"What are they doing, other stuff as well?"
00:15:55,00:15:56,No.
00:15:56,00:15:57,They're not sitting there.
00:15:57,00:15:59,I was just sitting there in the mountains.
00:15:59,00:16:02,"But you don't get any extra power at all as president, do you?"
00:16:02,00:16:06,"So they've just got this rotating council of seven, who are all exactly on a par."
00:16:06,00:16:07,And then you just get to be cool president for a year.
00:16:07,00:16:09,It's like a children's game.
00:16:09,00:16:13,"It's a bit like, I don't know if this is like this, but it sounds a bit like, do they"
00:16:13,00:16:17,"have like a council in Star Wars, which is a bit like that, like a council of jedis?"
00:16:17,00:16:21,"Oh, the council of jedis, yes, yeah, yeah, there's a thing like that, yeah, yeah, that's"
00:16:21,00:16:22,in the prequel.
00:16:22,00:16:27,"It's in Phantom Menace, so it's a Samuel L. James, and that's the one, if you're going"
00:16:27,00:16:35,"to watch one, that's the one, Samuel L. Jackson, and Yoda, there's a new, I think it's a new species"
00:16:35,00:16:38,of bat that has been named after Yoda.
00:16:38,00:16:39,"Yes, sir."
00:16:39,00:16:40,Yeah.
00:16:40,00:16:45,"And there was a headline about it in the Times a few days ago, and it said named after Yoda,"
00:16:45,00:16:46,new bat has been.
00:16:46,00:16:47,That was the headline.
00:16:47,00:16:48,"Oh, wow."
00:16:48,00:16:49,That's amazing.
00:16:49,00:16:54,"And so the president is what you might call primus into parades, which obviously I don't"
00:16:54,00:16:56,need to explain what that is to Dan.
00:16:56,00:17:01,"But it is, it's the first among equals, so everyone's equal, but they're kind of, they take"
00:17:01,00:17:05,"the ceremonial, you know, it's, it's like Dan hosting the podcast."
00:17:05,00:17:06,Yeah.
00:17:06,00:17:07,Yeah.
00:17:07,00:17:08,"It's a bit, it's a bit of power."
00:17:08,00:17:10,It's not quite that.
00:17:10,00:17:15,I would say Dan's the fourth among equals.
00:17:15,00:17:21,"And they can go on state visits, but technically they don't call them state visits because"
00:17:21,00:17:23,of this equality between all of the cabinet.
00:17:23,00:17:27,"And so if one of them came to Britain on a state visit, we would call it that, but they"
00:17:27,00:17:28,wouldn't call it that.
00:17:28,00:17:30,They just call it a foreign visit.
00:17:30,00:17:34,I think it would be funny if all seven of them had to come and sit on the same chair whenever
00:17:34,00:17:35,they had to do a state visit.
00:17:35,00:17:36,That would be amazing.
00:17:36,00:17:37,And I would watch that.
00:17:37,00:17:40,"And they have to answer in one voice when they're answering questions on the press, like"
00:17:40,00:17:41,in that improv game.
00:17:41,00:17:42,Yeah.
00:17:42,00:17:43,At the same time.
00:17:43,00:17:46,Or the other improv game where you say one word at a time.
00:17:46,00:17:47,Yeah.
00:17:47,00:17:48,I could do that one.
00:17:48,00:17:51,So do you think that's how they decide policy is they play that one word at a time
00:17:51,00:17:52,game?
00:17:52,00:17:53,"Well, let's try it for British policy."
00:17:53,00:17:59,We should make yeties illegal.
00:17:59,00:18:00,There we go.
00:18:00,00:18:01,We've got a policy already.
00:18:01,00:18:02,Damn it.
00:18:02,00:18:03,Sorry.
00:18:03,00:18:04,Damn it.
00:18:04,00:18:05,He screwed yourself up.
00:18:05,00:18:06,Yeah.
00:18:06,00:18:07,Oh man.
00:18:07,00:18:09,That's what they'd never been seen.
00:18:09,00:18:10,That is incredible.
00:18:10,00:18:13,"So you said, yeah, two people have held the post six times."
00:18:13,00:18:16,"One of them, the record is being a cabinet minister for 31 years."
00:18:16,00:18:17,Yeah.
00:18:17,00:18:18,Wow.
00:18:18,00:18:19,Third of a year is just sitting on a cabinet.
00:18:19,00:18:20,They're not just doing that.
00:18:20,00:18:22,They're making policy.
00:18:22,00:18:24,They're working very hard.
00:18:24,00:18:25,Absolutely.
00:18:25,00:18:27,No one's disputing the might of the Swiss state.
00:18:27,00:18:28,Yeah.
00:18:28,00:18:29,That's important that we say that.
00:18:29,00:18:31,"But they, yeah, they maintain their other job, right?"
00:18:31,00:18:35,"Like the president in 2014, their job was also being foreign minister."
00:18:35,00:18:37,They didn't stop being foreign minister.
00:18:37,00:18:38,That took up most of their time.
00:18:38,00:18:40,That's their main job as it were.
00:18:40,00:18:42,Presidency was a sort of sideline.
00:18:42,00:18:45,So I've been researching ex-presidents in general a bit.
00:18:45,00:18:46,Okay.
00:18:46,00:18:50,So did you know that Joe Biden can never drive a car again?
00:18:50,00:18:51,No.
00:18:51,00:18:52,He's not that impressive.
00:18:52,00:18:53,No.
00:18:53,00:18:54,But he has been ex-vice president.
00:18:54,00:18:55,Right.
00:18:55,00:18:58,So ex-presidents and vice-presidents are not allowed to drive after they leave the White House.
00:18:58,00:19:02,But are you using ex-presidents as a catch all term to refer to presidents and vice-presidents?
00:19:02,00:19:03,Yeah.
00:19:03,00:19:05,Because I'm sure that is what the vice-presidents do.
00:19:05,00:19:06,Yeah.
00:19:06,00:19:10,I've been the vice-presidents of the United States of America.
00:19:10,00:19:13,It's very useful on the lecture circuit.
00:19:13,00:19:16,"And this isn't a law either, but it is a secret service rule, as it were."
00:19:16,00:19:19,"As in the secret service says, well, we really think you shouldn't drive."
00:19:19,00:19:23,"And most people basically stick to it because someone else is driving you around, I guess."
00:19:23,00:19:27,"But George Bush, W, drives around his family farm with a truck and that's about as far as"
00:19:27,00:19:28,he's allowed to drive.
00:19:28,00:19:32,Are they looked after for the rest of their life by the secret service?
00:19:32,00:19:34,You get a secret service protection for the rest of your life.
00:19:34,00:19:35,Right.
00:19:35,00:19:37,"Is that the same with Prime Ministers, do you think?"
00:19:37,00:19:42,"I think if you started a war in Iraq, you have a lot of security forever."
00:19:42,00:19:45,"I think if you're Gordon Brown, you just know."
00:19:45,00:19:49,A policeman might ring out once a month to check your alright.
00:19:49,00:19:51,"Because David Cameron was at wilderness when we were there, wasn't he?"
00:19:51,00:19:52,Yeah.
00:19:52,00:19:54,And he had some goons around.
00:19:54,00:19:55,"How many he did, yeah."
00:19:55,00:19:56,He did.
00:19:56,00:19:57,But I missed him.
00:19:57,00:19:58,Ah.
00:19:58,00:19:59,I know.
00:19:59,00:20:01,We normally catch off at those things.
00:20:01,00:20:03,We normally catch off at those things.
00:20:03,00:20:08,"Guys, is there something everyone knows about Switzerland, that what is the capital?"
00:20:08,00:20:09,Oh.
00:20:09,00:20:10,Bern.
00:20:10,00:20:11,I think there are five.
00:20:11,00:20:12,Whoa.
00:20:12,00:20:13,Yeah.
00:20:13,00:20:15,I think it's the pub quiz.
00:20:15,00:20:16,I think it's like the cabinet.
00:20:16,00:20:19,"There are loads of capitals, and none of them is more important."
00:20:19,00:20:23,Or they each become the capital on a regular basis.
00:20:23,00:20:24,Nice.
00:20:24,00:20:25,You're all wrong.
00:20:25,00:20:26,It doesn't have a capital.
00:20:26,00:20:27,I didn't.
00:20:27,00:20:29,"That's why I didn't answer, because there is none."
00:20:29,00:20:30,Okay.
00:20:30,00:20:33,"So obviously, everyone thinks that Bern is the capital of Switzerland, but I just had no"
00:20:33,00:20:38,"idea that it has no official capital, so its constitution doesn't mention it."
00:20:38,00:20:39,"Is the defacto capital, isn't it?"
00:20:39,00:20:43,"It's a defacto capital, but there was a committee was set up by this seven-person"
00:20:43,00:20:49,council in 2002 to actually start work on making Bern the proper capital.
00:20:49,00:20:53,"And then it was suspended in 2004 and not resumed since, because it was too difficult"
00:20:53,00:20:54,a job.
00:20:54,00:20:56,"All I'm saying is, if you're in a pub quiz and they ask you"
00:20:56,00:21:01,"that question, go for my answer, not Anna's, because one, you'll get the point."
00:21:01,00:21:04,"And two, it'll take you a long time to write about this council in 2002."
00:21:04,00:21:07,"Yeah, and they don't give you much room sometimes, aren't they?"
00:21:07,00:21:08,"Sorry, is it Bern?"
00:21:08,00:21:09,Am I saying Bern in this pub quiz?
00:21:09,00:21:10,"I think Bern in the pub quiz, yeah."
00:21:10,00:21:14,"But, if I answered that, will really Geneva is the financial capital and Lausanne is the"
00:21:14,00:21:18,"industrial capital and Bern is the political capital and there are a couple of others, would"
00:21:18,00:21:19,I get the point?
00:21:19,00:21:20,No.
00:21:20,00:21:21,You can only put one answer down.
00:21:21,00:21:26,But otherwise you could put every word that's ever been invented as the answer to every
00:21:26,00:21:27,question.
00:21:27,00:21:28,"Oh, yeah."
00:21:28,00:21:31,They never give you that long.
00:21:31,00:21:35,"Just because this is about Switzerland's government, it is unbelievable, their system"
00:21:35,00:21:43,"of referenda. And so, in the past 20 years, they've had more than 180 referendums or referenda."
00:21:43,00:21:48,"The runner-up is Ireland, which has had 22 and Latvia then, which has had 8."
00:21:48,00:21:52,"They just have them constantly about everything, yes, bizarre."
00:21:52,00:21:56,"And one of the ones they had, for instance, was the one in 1959, as to whether women should"
00:21:56,00:21:59,be allowed to vote and they voted that down.
00:21:59,00:22:03,"So that was a referendum that only men could take part in, because women still couldn't"
00:22:03,00:22:05,vote in 1959.
00:22:05,00:22:09,This men in Switzerland voted against women getting the vote and they didn't get into 1971.
00:22:09,00:22:16,"So all you need is 100,000 signatures from registered voters in order to have the referendum."
00:22:16,00:22:19,"So that's why it can happen so easily, it's just people need to sign up."
00:22:19,00:22:26,There was a party that tried to have a referendum called the APPP and they were trying to ban
00:22:26,00:22:31,the use of PowerPoint in Switzerland.
00:22:31,00:22:37,"This, the APP claimed that 2.1 billion Swiss francs was being wasted on PowerPoint presentations"
00:22:37,00:22:41,from the sort of like taking people away from their jobs to see PowerPoint presentations
00:22:41,00:22:42,and so on.
00:22:42,00:22:47,They said 85% of workforce people saw no point in a PowerPoint presentation.
00:22:47,00:22:49,So did they have a petition about that then?
00:22:49,00:22:50,"Yeah, I think they did."
00:22:50,00:22:55,"And I think they failed to get the 100,000 people to sign in."
00:22:55,00:23:04,"What I was thinking is that their PowerPoint presentation, for short, would be the APPPPPP."
00:23:04,00:23:05,That is great.
00:23:05,00:23:10,"That's like someone trying to do my initials and then really stammering, suddenly."
00:23:10,00:23:14,"So when you become a member of the party, you have to buy the party manifesto, which is"
00:23:14,00:23:17,set out in this book called the PowerPoint fallacy.
00:23:17,00:23:23,"And it's authored by the guy who found the party, who's called Mathias Poem."
00:23:23,00:23:25,And he was asked in an interview.
00:23:25,00:23:28,So is this just a promotional gimmick for your book?
00:23:28,00:23:31,"And he said, yes, it is a tool to promote my book."
00:23:31,00:23:34,And then he said there's like further reasons for it doing it as well.
00:23:34,00:23:36,"But like, yeah, basically it was set up to sell his book."
00:23:36,00:23:37,Cool.
00:23:37,00:23:38,Fair enough.
00:23:38,00:23:39,At least he's honest.
00:23:39,00:23:40,But that existed.
00:23:40,00:23:41,That was a party.
00:23:41,00:23:42,Wow.
00:23:42,00:23:43,"Well, a party."
00:23:43,00:23:44,One guy.
00:23:44,00:23:45,One guy.
00:23:45,00:23:46,That's true.
00:23:46,00:23:47,"Yeah, I don't know how many people sign up."
00:23:47,00:23:48,I love my parties.
00:23:48,00:23:49,I like that.
00:23:49,00:23:58,"OK, it is time to move on to fact number three."
00:23:58,00:23:59,And that is my fact.
00:23:59,00:24:04,My fact this week is that a New Zealand scientist is planning to hunt for the Loch Ness monster
00:24:04,00:24:07,inside of a cup.
00:24:07,00:24:09,"Quick, quick search."
00:24:09,00:24:11,Or big cup.
00:24:11,00:24:12,"Yes, true."
00:24:12,00:24:13,"Actually, it's quite small."
00:24:13,00:24:14,"Small, messy."
00:24:14,00:24:15,Yes.
00:24:15,00:24:16,"Oh, yeah."
00:24:16,00:24:18,"Yeah, no, it's a big, it's a large cup."
00:24:18,00:24:19,It's a couple of liters.
00:24:19,00:24:20,It's a few cups.
00:24:20,00:24:26,"Basically, the idea of this is that a New Zealand scientist, called Professor Neil Gammel,"
00:24:26,00:24:32,has been promoting this thing called E DNA or Edna.
00:24:32,00:24:38,"And the idea is that we can now, taking samples of water from various lakes and oceans and"
00:24:38,00:24:44,"so on, can analyze the DNA that's found inside each cup and they're able to diagnose what"
00:24:44,00:24:46,"animals are in there, what animals aren't in there."
00:24:46,00:24:51,"If there's meant to be in there, it's a sort of new system of being able to count up fish"
00:24:51,00:24:57,and any ocean life of a specific area with accuracy from within just a bit of water.
00:24:57,00:25:02,The idea behind going to look for Nessie is he's effectively doing this as a publicity
00:25:02,00:25:05,stunt to promote the idea of E DNA.
00:25:05,00:25:06,This basically got picked up by the papers.
00:25:06,00:25:08,This was never his intention.
00:25:08,00:25:12,"When he announced the idea that he wanted to do more stuff with E DNA, Cryptozoologist"
00:25:12,00:25:15,"got in contact with him and said, could you do this for the Loch Ness?"
00:25:15,00:25:18,"And he said, you probably could, but I'm not planning to do that."
00:25:18,00:25:21,"The paper is kind of reported that he said, yes, that's what I'm planning on doing."
00:25:21,00:25:25,"And as a result, when he'd go to schools and everywhere else to talk about it, children"
00:25:25,00:25:28,would ask him specifically about Loch Ness.
00:25:28,00:25:30,"And using Loch Ness, he started explaining the procedures."
00:25:30,00:25:32,And people just way more interested generally.
00:25:32,00:25:37,So he's now up for the idea of doing the Loch Ness thing because people are actually listening.
00:25:37,00:25:38,It's insane.
00:25:38,00:25:39,You have to do it via the Loch Ness monster.
00:25:39,00:25:44,Do you know what he's trying next is organising a Swiss referendum?
00:25:44,00:25:50,So the other thing about it is that there's now a massive library of fish DNA because obviously
00:25:50,00:25:54,"it's no good finding a bit of DNA and then thinking, well, what did this come from when you"
00:25:54,00:25:57,"don't know the DNA of, let's say, a cod."
00:25:57,00:26:02,So there was a massive drive organised by a scientist who is called Jesse Alsubel.
00:26:02,00:26:07,They did 500 expeditions and they got basically thousands and thousands of specimens of animals
00:26:07,00:26:09,from all over the oceans.
00:26:09,00:26:13,So now they have this huge library of tens of thousands of fish DNA samples and now they
00:26:13,00:26:15,can actually match it up to something.
00:26:15,00:26:16,So that was the big finger printing drive.
00:26:16,00:26:17,That's good.
00:26:17,00:26:21,"Yeah, because otherwise you've just got a bit of DNA that's completely used for this."
00:26:21,00:26:22,"Yeah, this is nasty."
00:26:22,00:26:23,"Good bit nasty, yeah, sure."
00:26:23,00:26:24,It could be anything.
00:26:24,00:26:25,Yeah.
00:26:25,00:26:28,You really need some kind of reference system.
00:26:28,00:26:32,"It's a hard thing to research because I kept getting articles about, like, world's"
00:26:32,00:26:33,oldest women dies.
00:26:33,00:26:36,"You just keep getting articles about people called Edna, don't you?"
00:26:36,00:26:38,"Yeah, yeah."
00:26:38,00:26:42,So one of the ways it's going to be important is because we need to be able to keep
00:26:42,00:26:45,count of our fish and know where they are because fish stocks are being depleted.
00:26:45,00:26:47,And we have a bunch of ways of counting fish.
00:26:47,00:26:51,I was reading an article I think it was in the Atlantic about how a lot of scientists and
00:26:51,00:26:56,"fishermen still just do the traditional way of counting fish, which is basically that"
00:26:56,00:26:59,"your ownership, you've, what is this?"
00:26:59,00:27:00,It's just a traditional way.
00:27:00,00:27:06,"It must be just one, two, three fish, two fish, three fish, four, yeah."
00:27:06,00:27:08,"It is this, but they spend months and months out there."
00:27:08,00:27:13,"So in Massachusetts, these guys go out in a boat and they have a conveyor belt set up on"
00:27:13,00:27:17,their boat and they get this huge net and then they plop all these fish onto the conveyor
00:27:17,00:27:18,belt.
00:27:18,00:27:22,"And then someone's job is to pick a fish off a conveyor belt, shout what species it is, throw"
00:27:22,00:27:24,it into the right species pile.
00:27:24,00:27:29,Someone else's job is to shove it up against a measuring board and automatically a magnet
00:27:29,00:27:30,measure challenge.
00:27:30,00:27:31,It's like a mugshot of it.
00:27:31,00:27:32,"Yeah, it is."
00:27:32,00:27:33,"It's exactly like that, yeah."
00:27:33,00:27:35,But then do we eat these fish?
00:27:35,00:27:40,"They throw them back in, well, they weigh them, so the question is, how do they know that"
00:27:40,00:27:43,"it's not the same, you know, cards the next time?"
00:27:43,00:27:44,They don't even explain.
00:27:44,00:27:49,"Hey, Jerry, this one looks a bit like that one from three weeks ago."
00:27:49,00:27:54,"Throwing them back alive still, so they're putting them on the conveyor belt, still alive."
00:27:54,00:27:57,"They're shoving them up against a measuring board, still alive."
00:27:57,00:28:00,"They plop them on a set of weighing skills, still alive and then they're sent back down"
00:28:00,00:28:05,and no one believes them.
00:28:05,00:28:09,"You're right, that's the UFO of the fish world, isn't it?"
00:28:09,00:28:13,"So the reason that it's really hard to break out of this system, which is actually not as"
00:28:13,00:28:18,"efficient as, for instance, using a drone to count all the fish, or maybe using a DNA monitoring"
00:28:18,00:28:22,"system, is that it's kind of like the thing Andy mentioned, it's a referencing problem."
00:28:22,00:28:28,"So because we started counting fish this way in the 1950s or '60s, the only way we know"
00:28:28,00:28:32,how many fish there are compared to before is by comparing it to the previous house.
00:28:32,00:28:33,"Oh, right."
00:28:33,00:28:35,So we just have to keep on doing this system.
00:28:35,00:28:38,"If we suddenly do a new system, we'll find way more fish, and we won't know how to compare"
00:28:38,00:28:40,it to how many there were before.
00:28:40,00:28:41,So we're stuck with it.
00:28:41,00:28:42,We're stuck with guys.
00:28:42,00:28:46,What we need to do is come up with a new system and then do them both together for a few
00:28:46,00:28:47,years.
00:28:47,00:28:51,"It's a really good idea, James, and then compare the difference."
00:28:51,00:28:54,You should get on that committee.
00:28:54,00:28:58,"I have a cryptozoology fact, because we're on Nessie."
00:28:58,00:29:02,"So this is a story from the BBC, this was North Carolina last week, and it was about Bigfoot"
00:29:02,00:29:03,then.
00:29:03,00:29:04,"Oh, I know."
00:29:04,00:29:05,There was a sighting of Bigfoot.
00:29:05,00:29:06,Yeah.
00:29:06,00:29:07,Hugely exciting.
00:29:07,00:29:09,Group of Hunters called Bigfoot 9-1-1.
00:29:09,00:29:14,They said they'd seen Bigfoot only for a local shaman to get in touch saying it was me.
00:29:14,00:29:15,Yeah.
00:29:15,00:29:21,"I was walking around in a suit made of animal skins, and he's called Gawain."
00:29:21,00:29:24,"But the man who wrote the group said on Facebook, ""I want to address the recent revelation"
00:29:24,00:29:26,"from the gentleman that stated that I saw him in the woods."""
00:29:26,00:29:29,"This is quite a fascinating story, but there are a few problems with it."
00:29:29,00:29:34,"Number one, the creature that I saw was 8-foot tall with stringy matted hair."
00:29:34,00:29:37,"The gentleman in the picture does not appear tall, too."
00:29:37,00:29:41,The creature moved with speed unmatched by any human.
00:29:41,00:29:42,So…
00:29:42,00:29:45,But the thing is that Gawain McGregor was there looking for Bigfoot himself.
00:29:45,00:29:46,Yes.
00:29:46,00:29:51,"He wanders around addressing an animal skins, reciting what he says is a Sasquatch prayer."
00:29:51,00:29:56,"And he says that he himself has met Bigfoot before, but has now been mistaken for Bigfoot."
00:29:56,00:29:57,Are you guys ready?
00:29:57,00:30:01,Are they just seeing each other constantly and thinking they're sighting Bigfoot?
00:30:01,00:30:03,They did find Nessie this year.
00:30:03,00:30:04,Did they?
00:30:04,00:30:06,They found A Nessie.
00:30:06,00:30:12,It was a 9-meter model of the Loch Ness Monster built in 1969 for a Sherlock Holmes movie
00:30:12,00:30:16,"and sank to the bottom of Loch Ness, and they found it with an underwater robot."
00:30:16,00:30:18,They took a photo of it.
00:30:18,00:30:19,That's amazing.
00:30:19,00:30:20,That's really cool.
00:30:20,00:30:21,"Yeah, that's awesome."
00:30:21,00:30:25,Did they get to anyone get excited initially or were they all sensible people who knew what
00:30:25,00:30:26,was happening?
00:30:26,00:30:27,"Next, he's dead."
00:30:27,00:30:35,"Do you know you must know about Robert Rines, the Nessie Hunter, who I'd never heard"
00:30:35,00:30:39,"of, but is really cool, so he's a proper scientist."
00:30:39,00:30:41,He dies not that long ago.
00:30:41,00:30:45,"You're already looking skeptical, Andy, but he made massive contributions to science"
00:30:45,00:30:51,"in America, but was also obsessed with the Loch Ness Monster and convinced it existed."
00:30:51,00:30:54,So he had 800 patents.
00:30:54,00:30:59,"He developed this way to improve radar and sonar images, and now it's used in Patriot"
00:30:59,00:31:01,"Missiles, which they use in the military."
00:31:01,00:31:04,"He found the Titanic wreck, and he found the wreck of the Bismarck."
00:31:04,00:31:08,He was one of the people on that team who uncovered the Titanic.
00:31:08,00:31:11,He made massive leaps in ultrasound imaging.
00:31:11,00:31:15,"He contributed to eye surgery, but he's just remembered for the fact that he was obsessed"
00:31:15,00:31:17,with the Loch Ness Monster.
00:31:17,00:31:23,"And so, for instance, he hired a perfumer once to concoct the kind of scent that would attract"
00:31:23,00:31:27,"a creature like the Loch Ness Monster, and he trained dolphins to find it."
00:31:27,00:31:31,So he got cameras on dolphins' heads and trained them to be able to find Nessie.
00:31:31,00:31:32,"But yeah, it's so weird."
00:31:32,00:31:34,"He's this really cool, legit guy."
00:31:34,00:31:37,He once played a violin duet with Albert Einstein.
00:31:37,00:31:42,"He was a Harvard scientist, but who also kept on trying to find the Loch Ness Monster?"
00:31:42,00:31:43,"It's weird, isn't it?"
00:31:43,00:31:44,That's weird.
00:31:44,00:31:45,It's because my hero.
00:31:45,00:31:48,He painted a form of chopsticks with hinges on them as well.
00:31:48,00:31:50,W. My Hero.
00:31:50,00:31:55,"I was reading that in, this is about in 2012, and I couldn't find an update on this."
00:31:55,00:32:04,"But in America and Louisiana, Christian schools that are sort of, you know, sort of believe"
00:32:04,00:32:10,"that dinosaurs existed at the same time as humans, creationists, sort of schools."
00:32:10,00:32:14,"They started teaching that the Loch Ness Monster is real, a solid scientific fact to help"
00:32:14,00:32:17,back up all of their creationist stuff.
00:32:17,00:32:19,So there's an ACE textbook.
00:32:19,00:32:26,"This is Biology 1099, Accelerated Christian Education Inc, who published it, and it reads,"
00:32:26,00:32:27,"""Our dinosaurs are alive today."
00:32:27,00:32:30,Scientists are becoming more convinced of their existence.
00:32:30,00:32:32,"Have you heard of the Loch Ness Monster in Scotland?"""
00:32:32,00:32:37,"Nessie, for sure, has been recorded on sonar from a small submarine described by eye witnesses"
00:32:37,00:32:38,and photographed by others.
00:32:38,00:32:41,Nessie appears to be a pleasy of sore.
00:32:41,00:32:44,So that's actually taught as fact within these schools.
00:32:44,00:32:45,It's quite cool.
00:32:45,00:32:46,I didn't know that Nessie is not quite cool.
00:32:46,00:32:47,It's not cool.
00:32:47,00:32:48,Exactly.
00:32:48,00:32:51,"Yeah, the leesia sores, I don't think the dinosaurs really, what?"
00:32:51,00:32:53,So that is a massive mistake they've made there.
00:32:53,00:32:54,Yeah.
00:32:54,00:32:55,They're not dinosaurs?
00:32:55,00:32:57,"No, but in the same way that teradactyls were not dinosaurs."
00:32:57,00:33:01,"Yeah, but don't put sore on the end of your name and not be a dino."
00:33:01,00:33:06,"Yeah, but dino is not on the front of the name, yeah, but sore is on the end of everything."
00:33:06,00:33:08,"Also, Tyrannosaur is a dinosaur."
00:33:08,00:33:09,Yeah.
00:33:09,00:33:10,Yeah.
00:33:10,00:33:11,Yeah.
00:33:11,00:33:12,Yeah.
00:33:12,00:33:21,"I mean, if you're not sure what Twitter has been telling you about, it's been weeks."
00:33:21,00:33:24,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show."
00:33:24,00:33:25,That is Andy.
00:33:25,00:33:30,My fact is that your liver grows and shrinks by 40% every 24 hours.
00:33:30,00:33:33,I am in love with the liver.
00:33:33,00:33:34,"Yeah, that's great fact."
00:33:34,00:33:35,Wow.
00:33:35,00:33:36,What a thing.
00:33:36,00:33:39,"Okay, so this was based on a New York Times article I read, it was just a sort of feature"
00:33:39,00:33:44,"on the, it wasn't really a news article as such, now breaking news, you've got a liver,"
00:33:44,00:33:45,but it is so cool.
00:33:45,00:33:48,So the liver grows and shrinks every day.
00:33:48,00:33:52,"It's got its own internal clock, so it knows what time to do it."
00:33:52,00:33:57,"And it's, it grows and shrinks in accordance with day and night, more or less."
00:33:57,00:34:03,"So they tested mice and mice, their liver expands after dark and then it shrinks back"
00:34:03,00:34:07,"when daylight is approaching, but that's because mice are nocturnal."
00:34:07,00:34:11,And obviously humans are dying and also our liver grows in the morning and then it shrinks
00:34:11,00:34:12,at night.
00:34:12,00:34:14,Do you think it depends like when you go to bed?
00:34:14,00:34:17,So I got to bed extremely like and dangos bed relatively early.
00:34:17,00:34:18,Yeah.
00:34:18,00:34:21,So do you think his liver expands earlier than mine?
00:34:21,00:34:22,Maybe.
00:34:22,00:34:25,"So your liver might be different sizes now, just because of your own body clocks."
00:34:25,00:34:26,That's cool.
00:34:26,00:34:29,"Does, would my liver get jet lag when I go to Australia?"
00:34:29,00:34:32,I think all of you gets jet lag.
00:34:32,00:34:36,Does that mean that there are British people walking around Australia with tiny liver?
00:34:36,00:34:39,Getting pickled on the beer much quicker.
00:34:39,00:34:41,"I think that's what we're saying, yeah."
00:34:41,00:34:45,"And Australians here have massive liver, so no, that's not what we're saying."
00:34:45,00:34:46,"They have the same problem, don't they?"
00:34:46,00:34:48,They would have the same problem.
00:34:48,00:34:49,Yeah.
00:34:49,00:34:51,So it's the size of a chihuahua.
00:34:51,00:34:52,At which stage?
00:34:52,00:34:56,Chihuahua's don't grow and shrink 40% during the day.
00:34:56,00:34:57,Full size.
00:34:57,00:34:58,Small full size chihuahua.
00:34:58,00:34:59,Hang on.
00:34:59,00:35:00,When the liver's at full size.
00:35:00,00:35:02,"Chihuahua's are like, they're big, right?"
00:35:02,00:35:04,"Well, they're not as big as a great date."
00:35:04,00:35:05,I said a small chihuahua there.
00:35:05,00:35:07,"I know, but just picture it very quickly."
00:35:07,00:35:09,A chihuahua inside me right now.
00:35:09,00:35:10,Yeah.
00:35:10,00:35:11,I'm going to really tie a chihuahua.
00:35:11,00:35:12,I think you mean a chihuahua without the tail?
00:35:12,00:35:13,Or legs.
00:35:13,00:35:14,Or legs.
00:35:14,00:35:16,They're the size of the Mexican state of Chihuahua.
00:35:16,00:35:17,Right.
00:35:17,00:35:23,"OK, that is based on a mental floss article, so that is a mental floss is very reliable,"
00:35:23,00:35:24,so I don't know what I'm saying.
00:35:24,00:35:25,"They are, yeah."
00:35:25,00:35:26,Yeah.
00:35:26,00:35:27,I believe that.
00:35:27,00:35:28,A chihuahua.
00:35:28,00:35:29,Yeah.
00:35:29,00:35:30,"Oh, please."
00:35:30,00:35:31,OK.
00:35:31,00:35:32,Chihuahua's out that big.
00:35:32,00:35:33,They're bigger than that.
00:35:33,00:35:34,Yeah.
00:35:34,00:35:41,They're just destroying a really tiny dog that has some mouse dressed up as a chihuahua.
00:35:41,00:35:42,Yeah.
00:35:42,00:35:43,I just think it's amazing.
00:35:43,00:35:44,Yeah.
00:35:44,00:35:45,It's incredible.
00:35:45,00:35:46,It is very awesome.
00:35:46,00:35:50,Is it thought to be because it's so that it can get used to rejuvenating?
00:35:50,00:35:51,Is that right?
00:35:51,00:35:54,"So that if it's, you know, flooded with lots of poisonous stuff, at least it's able"
00:35:54,00:35:57,to like shrink and rebuild itself constantly.
00:35:57,00:36:00,"It is like, basically, a bit of X-man, hasn't it?"
00:36:00,00:36:01,Yeah.
00:36:01,00:36:03,Because it's really part of everyone's got this part of the body that's regenerating
00:36:03,00:36:04,all the time.
00:36:04,00:36:05,Yeah.
00:36:05,00:36:06,"Oh, yeah."
00:36:06,00:36:07,So we're like part wolverine just in our liver.
00:36:07,00:36:08,Yeah.
00:36:08,00:36:09,And we mentioned before that--
00:36:09,00:36:10,"Oh, wolverine is all liver."
00:36:10,00:36:11,Yes.
00:36:11,00:36:12,Wow.
00:36:12,00:36:13,That's good.
00:36:13,00:36:18,"So we said before that if you chop your liver down to a quarter of the size, it will regenerate."
00:36:18,00:36:19,Within a few weeks.
00:36:19,00:36:20,Yeah.
00:36:20,00:36:21,It's full size.
00:36:21,00:36:24,"And I think you said that if you put a chihuahua's liver into a great day, and it will grow"
00:36:24,00:36:26,to the size of a great day's liver.
00:36:26,00:36:27,Yes.
00:36:27,00:36:28,Is what?
00:36:28,00:36:29,Mad.
00:36:29,00:36:31,So you can donate half of your liver to somebody.
00:36:31,00:36:32,Yeah.
00:36:32,00:36:34,And they within a few weeks will have a full liver.
00:36:34,00:36:35,And so will you.
00:36:35,00:36:38,"So we only need one liver for the whole human race, really."
00:36:38,00:36:39,Yes.
00:36:39,00:36:41,It's like that Greek myth where they share one eye.
00:36:41,00:36:46,But if you left a bit of eye behind in the socket and then the eye just multiplied.
00:36:46,00:36:51,"Halon doesn't Prometheus when he's chained to the mountain in the myth, gets his liver torn"
00:36:51,00:36:53,out by a bird every day and then it grows back.
00:36:53,00:36:54,I think they did know about--
00:36:54,00:36:55,Oh.
00:36:55,00:36:56,So they must have known--
00:36:56,00:36:57,Hang on.
00:36:57,00:36:58,They can't have known.
00:36:58,00:36:59,How would they know?
00:36:59,00:37:00,How could they know?
00:37:00,00:37:03,Prometheus gets his liver torn out every day and then the next day it's grown back and
00:37:03,00:37:05,the bird tears it out again and that's his punishment.
00:37:05,00:37:06,"Yeah, yeah."
00:37:06,00:37:07,How did they know?
00:37:07,00:37:08,That they must have known.
00:37:08,00:37:09,I don't think they did.
00:37:09,00:37:10,You think it's a coincidence?
00:37:10,00:37:11,I think it's a coincidence.
00:37:11,00:37:12,I'm calling it.
00:37:12,00:37:18,"So did you know that Tim Cook, who's the current CEO of Apple, wanted to donate his liver"
00:37:18,00:37:22,or 50% of it to Steve Jobs when he needed a liver donation.
00:37:22,00:37:27,And Tim Cook said that he's only been shouted out by Steve Jobs three or four times in their
00:37:27,00:37:28,entire career.
00:37:28,00:37:30,"And they worked very closely for many, many years."
00:37:30,00:37:34,"And one of the times was that when he knocked on his door and said, can I give you some of"
00:37:34,00:37:35,my liver?
00:37:35,00:37:38,"And Steve Jobs said, no, don't be an idiot."
00:37:38,00:37:39,You shouldn't have to do that for me.
00:37:39,00:37:40,But he shouted at him.
00:37:40,00:37:43,"Yeah, apparently you got angry because I think Tim Cook was really insistent and said, I"
00:37:43,00:37:44,wanted to donate.
00:37:44,00:37:45,Was it in his hand?
00:37:45,00:37:46,Yeah.
00:37:46,00:37:47,"Oh, my God."
00:37:47,00:37:50,"You were dripping it on my floor, get out of here."
00:37:50,00:37:51,What is this?
00:37:51,00:37:52,Chop liver?
00:37:52,00:37:59,"So Steve Jobs actually had a liver transplant in 2008, or he had a liver transplant"
00:37:59,00:38:00,in the 2000s.
00:38:00,00:38:05,"And the doctor who transplanted his liver later bought his house, which is quite nice."
00:38:05,00:38:11,I went onto the old QI forums where we do our research for TV show and found a discussion
00:38:11,00:38:18,"between me and Andy about whether we could eat human livers and not die, because there's"
00:38:18,00:38:22,"an old fact that if you eat a polar bear's liver, you'll die because it's got so much"
00:38:22,00:38:24,vitamin A in it.
00:38:24,00:38:29,"And so we worked out how much vitamin A there was per gram in a human liver, which is"
00:38:29,00:38:34,"575 international units, and then how heavy a liver was."
00:38:34,00:38:39,And then what the maximum single intake dose for vitamin A was in a human.
00:38:39,00:38:43,"And we worked out that if you ate one and a third raw livers in a single sitting, you would"
00:38:43,00:38:46,probably die of vitamin A poisoning.
00:38:46,00:38:49,"It might be a bit different if you cooked it, but not too different."
00:38:49,00:38:53,"So if Hannibal Lecter, for instance, had two human livers in one sitting, he would die"
00:38:53,00:38:54,of vitamin A poisoning.
00:38:54,00:38:57,"But that's why they never show that scene in the film, because they knew it would be"
00:38:57,00:38:58,unrealistic.
00:38:58,00:38:59,Show me eating two livers.
00:38:59,00:39:00,Yeah.
00:39:00,00:39:04,"Well, the other thing that would be realistic in the film is if you eat too much vitamin A,"
00:39:04,00:39:08,your body stops being able to star it and you turn orange.
00:39:08,00:39:11,So the police should have been able to find them by just looking for an orange person.
00:39:11,00:39:12,Wow.
00:39:12,00:39:18,Did you know that you can grow a baby in a liver.
00:39:18,00:39:19,Like human baby?
00:39:19,00:39:24,"Four babies have been born, not out of a womb, but out of a liver."
00:39:24,00:39:26,"Deliberately or ectopically, right?"
00:39:26,00:39:27,"Well, nearly."
00:39:27,00:39:32,"So normally, egg gets fertilised, moves down into womb."
00:39:32,00:39:36,"Sometimes egg gets stuck in fallopian tube, problem, it's called nectopic pregnancy."
00:39:36,00:39:43,"Sometimes, one in 100,000 times, the egg just falls out of the fallopian tube and it wanders"
00:39:43,00:39:44,off through the body.
00:39:44,00:39:51,"In the very rare cases where the fertilised egg lands in the abdomen in the liver, it's"
00:39:51,00:39:53,got a massive blood supply there.
00:39:53,00:39:55,The only thing it lacks is the muscular wall of the womb.
00:39:55,00:39:59,"So it's not as well protected, but no placenta though."
00:39:59,00:40:00,So how do they...
00:40:00,00:40:01,It grows.
00:40:01,00:40:04,"Because food comes through it, this is incredible."
00:40:04,00:40:05,I know.
00:40:05,00:40:06,Because it does so much.
00:40:06,00:40:08,"The liver does like 500 jobs, isn't it?"
00:40:08,00:40:09,It does 500 jobs.
00:40:09,00:40:12,"It's like the jaw jaws bomb of the human body, isn't it?"
00:40:12,00:40:16,"And so the last time was in 2003 in South Africa, doctors literally went into a woman's"
00:40:16,00:40:19,liver and pulled out a healthy baby.
00:40:19,00:40:20,What?
00:40:20,00:40:22,That is one of the best facts I've ever heard.
00:40:22,00:40:23,That's incredible.
00:40:23,00:40:29,"The question for the baby as well, half of its day, it's flat, gets 50% bigger."
00:40:29,00:40:37,"Okay, that is it, that is all of our facts."
00:40:37,00:40:39,Thank you so much for listening.
