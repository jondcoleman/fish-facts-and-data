00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.840
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.160
 to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.320
 here with James Harkin, Anna Chazinski and Andrew Hunter Murray and once again we have gathered

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.120
 around the microphones of our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.920
 order here we go. Starting with you Chazinski. My fact this week is that one of the costume

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.880
 designers on Star Wars also made a mousse suit for scientists to help them sneak up on mousse

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.240
 or mousse's. Or mousse such. Or mousse. Is mousse such the actual plural?

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.920
 Yeah, because it's a Native American word and that's how this particular tribe pluralises

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.160
 it. So what's the advantage of sneaking up on a mousse?

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.200
 Well if you want to hang out with them, which these scientists did so they were studying

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.800
 mousse in the Yellowstone area and I think there was specifically at this time looking at

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.920
 how they were responding to predators. So wolves, numbers had declined in Yellowstone and

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.960
 mousse had got used to living without them and then I think they'd come back and the scientist

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.960
 wanted to see if mousse had forgotten how to escape wolves and so then you needed to put

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.440
 wolf poo and we where mousse lived to check how they responded to the threat. And so this

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.400
 researcher called Joel Berger asked a woman who worked on the set of Star Wars to make

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.800
 him a mousse suit so we could go and deposit mousse poo and we around mousse.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.080
 Yeah, because they did used to before the mousse suit came along, did attempt to sort of throw

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:48.160
 balls of poo and we out at the mousse in order to attract them towards it but they couldn't

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.280
 throw far enough so they ended up just littering the landscape.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.920
 I think they still sometimes use balls, they use snowballs so they get snowballs and they'll

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.120
 put, sometimes they even put human we on because they want to see how they'll deal with

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.920
 humans so they'll wee on a snowball and then throw it towards the mousse.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.560
 Yeah, that's right and they would slingshot them as well.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.880
 And Joel Berger wrote about this, he's written a book called The Better To Eat You With and

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.200
 he describes the moment where he first, he had his like there's a eureka moment where

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.080
 he's in the place observing the mousse and he says to his colleague, wait I've had a brilliant

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.200
 idea, I'm going to wee on the snowball but then he says he's run out of wee because he

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.480
 recently went to the loo so he just instead of explaining that properly.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:35.600
 I would say you've run out of wee again.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.560
 But his wee stockpile was depleted.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.640
 So he just made a snowball with his hands and then turned to his colleague and said quick

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.480
 press on this so I can throw it at the deer.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.240
 I think his colleague is his wife is it not?

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.680
 This was a male colleague, not his wife, maybe he's got more than one colleague.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.880
 Yeah, probably not after this experiment, probably goes through colleagues quite quickly.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.440
 I've been to Yellowstone and seen the mousse and you can drive right up to them and they just

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.440
 sit there.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.440
 Oh yeah.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.920
 So I don't know why he needs to sneak up on them.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.440
 Yeah, that's a really good point.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.760
 Are they actually yellow stones or are they urine coverage snowballs?

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.880
 It was just called Stone National Park before he got that.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:18.880
 This is the thing.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.880
 So when they do it in the experiments with the snowballs they also use human feces and

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.320
 they have to use toilet paper I think because they say well we're going to do this in a

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.760
 safe by a charitable way rather than just pooing into a snowball.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.760
 Yeah, that was interesting.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.520
 I think I would take the poo and then put the snowball around it.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.520
 That's how you do that.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.440
 Who went to the snowball?

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.960
 Everyone's got different methods James and we'll see who's more effective.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.800
 I don't think you'd be very good at this Andy.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.960
 I'm lethal in a snowball fight.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.360
 You have to wait for the other team to contract dysentery now.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.360
 Meanwhile you'll be impelted.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.480
 It's a long technique James but come the next snowball match in two days they're going

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.320
 to lose.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.400
 So the idea with this mousse suit is that they wanted to sneak up on the mousse in order to

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:13.920
 get close enough by tricking the mousse into thinking they were fellow mousse.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.120
 So this is who he did do it with his wife who's written up in all the articles as miscutting

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.120
 him.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.440
 So miscutting him and Dr. Burger got inside the mousse suit.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.440
 She was the back.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.720
 He was the front and they walked up to the mousse and I don't think the mousse took to them

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.600
 too well from what I read.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.040
 He said it worked quite well in the anti managed five successful deposits but maybe they didn't

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.040
 like it at first.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:41.240
 Did they make it realistic as in did they push the real wolf droppings that they were testing

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.720
 the mousse with out of the back end of their costume mousse?

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.200
 No because they don't want the mousse to think that wolves look like mousse.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.200
 All wolves come disguised as mousse.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.440
 Yeah to wolf in mousse clothing.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:59.440
 So the mousse have a saying is just a human in mousse clothing to mean and who's shitting

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.440
 wolf shit.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.160
 This is just a way to really confuse a lot of mousse isn't it?

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.160
 Yeah.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.760
 But the mousse wouldn't be able to make the connection between the poo they'd seen coming

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.960
 out and think smell it and think oh that's what that's.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:10.960
 Of course they would.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.680
 Now that's what animals do all the time.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.720
 Animals are always smelling poo's and being able to recognise other animals.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.880
 But they I don't think that a mousse is clever enough I'm sorry if this is slundering the

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.680
 mousse community to see a scientist dressed as a mousse pushing a wolf poo out of a fake

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.960
 mousse costume and then go over and sniff it and think that's a dangerous animal.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.120
 But do you not see that they might be confused?

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.720
 I can see they might be confused.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.400
 No one's debating that.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.400
 That was fair.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.520
 But this is so you ask if this was realistic and I guess she was quite a good costume designer

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:50.360
 castles is quite big but it was made of styrofoam and cloth and a lot of them seemed to

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.360
 made of styrofoam.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.880
 So scientists quite often want to sneak up on animals for various reasons and styrofoam

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.840
 seems to be the material of choice.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:04.400
 So someone this year in Montana dressed up as a grizzly bear in Glacier National Park

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.760
 in Montana to try and scare mountain goats and again styrofoam costume.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:09.760
 Right.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.640
 And is that to train the goats to be afraid of bears?

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.640
 Yes.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:14.640
 Wow.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.640
 That's good.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.320
 It's because do you know why they've stopped being afraid of predators generally?

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.320
 Sorry.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.320
 What animals we talk about here?

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:22.320
 This is mountain goats.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.760
 Is it because there aren't enough predators around to be afraid of?

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.920
 We're back on urine and feces.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.080
 It's due to human urine.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:34.440
 So there was a piece of the New York Times last week about how in this National Park all

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.800
 the mountain goats are flocking towards where humans go because they we along all the tracking

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.840
 tracks and the we's full of salt and goats love salt.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.080
 So human urine creates salt licks.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.280
 And so now they're just stopping nervous about predators because they spend so much time

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.280
 around humans.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.280
 So how do they scare them?

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.600
 They just run up to them and so they rip them apart with their bear costume hands.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.600
 That's not scaring.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:55.600
 That is scary.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.600
 That is scary.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.840
 You wouldn't say terrible news.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.240
 Someone recently got scared by a bear and then you read the small print in terms of they

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.240
 got torn to pieces by it.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.840
 But it's poorer on coragelezotra.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.080
 All the other goats would be very scared.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.080
 That's true.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.080
 Yeah.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.080
 If you invited all the goats to an event.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.080
 Yeah.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.600
 So there's going to be a massive urine lump for you to alter lick and then a bear turns

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.280
 up and rips the goat to pieces.

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:22.920
 You stop licking urine lumps and also sorry is poor on coragelezotra real phrase that people

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:23.920
 use.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.320
 I was quite scared by that phrase.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.320
 Yeah me too.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.960
 I thought you just messed up what you were saying but you carried on.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.760
 I was going to address it after the podcast.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.240
 You're right mate.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.240
 It's a French phrase.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.080
 It's obviously a French phrase.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.760
 It's an English podcast.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:39.760
 Yeah.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:40.760
 I forgot that.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:41.760
 Sorry.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:42.760
 I was thinking of my other podcast.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:48.120
 You're actually a Frenchman in an undecast you know.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.120
 We lost and sorry.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.080
 Do you want to tell you about poor on coragelezotra?

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.080
 Oh yeah.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.080
 Sorry.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.080
 Yeah.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.080
 It's a phrase.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.080
 So let's say.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.080
 I mean we know what it means.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.080
 Oh yeah.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.080
 We know what it means.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.400
 But for the people I hope you don't.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:04.800
 You explain that anyway because you explain what would happen with the bear killing one goat

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:05.800
 in there.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.800
 Yeah.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:07.800
 No.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:08.800
 But I just think Dan's being a bit cocky there.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.800
 I mean we definitely know what it means when he didn't know what language it was a second

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:11.800
 again.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:19.240
 So we lost an iconic man in a suit this week.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:26.400
 The sad passing of a man called Haruo Nakajima who was for the first 12 Godzilla movies.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.400
 Godzilla.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.400
 Oh.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.400
 Spent the first...

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.400
 The wall.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.760
 Spent a large chunk of his career inside the same Godzilla suit.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:34.920
 So they use the same actor.

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:38.600
 He's like Andy Circus for the Lord of the Rings trilogy, you know.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.640
 He's just used as the CGI guy.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.440
 He was the same guy in every suit.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:47.280
 My face then when you said Andy Circus in Lord of the Rings was the same as your face where

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.600
 Andy said the French phrase.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:53.160
 Andy Circus was a golem in Lord of the Rings.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.360
 What he wasn't in a suit was he because I think I've seen clips of that.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.360
 And he's like a CGI.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.360
 He's the CGI.

00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.360
 Yes.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.360
 Yes.

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.360
 Right.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.680
 And he also is the chief ape in the Planet of the Apes films.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:04.680
 Yes.

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:05.680
 And what else did he do?

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:06.680
 Tintin.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:07.680
 He's Captain Haddock.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:11.640
 And he's something else in King Kong.

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.640
 King Kong is King Kong.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:13.640
 He was a Boss King Kong.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:14.640
 Yeah.

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:15.640
 He didn't play Godzilla in the recent...

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:16.640
 No, I don't think so.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:21.920
 But I would go and see a circus show, which was Andy Circus, as all the animals that Andy

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.280
 Circus has played over the course of his career, and they're all Andy Circus in different

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.280
 costumes.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.280
 Right.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.280
 What about...

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.280
 He was in a little Dorit as one of the bad guys.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.280
 Absolutely.

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:31.280
 Would you include that?

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.280
 Yeah, 100%.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.280
 Okay.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:39.440
 So this guy was famous in Japan for being Godzilla, and he was in it for 12 movies.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.600
 He's just passed away, age 88.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:47.600
 And in order for him to properly understand how Godzilla might move, he spent a lot of time

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:52.240
 at the zoo watching the elephants and bears to see how they walked and how they...

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:55.960
 So he claimed that he did method acting on how Godzilla would exist.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:56.960
 He took it really seriously.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:57.960
 Wow.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:58.960
 Yeah, so we lost him this week.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:04.920
 A very iconic man in a suit on Star Wars as well, sort of in costume news of Star Wars.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:10.080
 For a very long time, they lost Obi-Wan Kenobi's robe.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.640
 The one that Alex Guinness wears in the movies.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:16.280
 And so it was a shame because it's such an iconic thing that they obviously didn't realize

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.200
 at the time how iconic it would become over the years.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:25.600
 But it was found in 2005, and it was in the shop warehouse of this company called Angels

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:31.080
 that does costume lending for movies and for Halloween costumes and so on.

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.080
 So Angels.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:36.800
 Angels, in fact, there used to be one or so might be one, just around the corner from us.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:43.000
 And yeah, they found it in there, and it spent the sort of 30 years that it's been missing,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.400
 being rented out during a Halloween New Year or for people dressing as monks.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.200
 So it would be a fancy dress costume.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.120
 It made it into a few movies, unknowingly, like the mummy.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.120
 It's in the mummy.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.120
 No.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:59.400
 So this is in 2005, they found it again, and yeah, it was someone working.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.160
 There was like, this feels like this is not your regular month outfit.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.600
 Look, how did they know it was hosted?

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.080
 Have his name tag in the back.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.800
 So, yeah, I couldn't find that detail.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:13.600
 What I do know is that the creator of the costumes, the original Star Wars costume designer,

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.520
 different to the one you're talking about, Anna.

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:19.800
 He verified that it was that, he said, yeah, so there must have been something on it to identify it.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:20.800
 Great.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:21.800
 The Angels is amazing, though.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:22.800
 I didn't know this place exists.

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.680
 It basically supplies costumes for all the best films.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:32.400
 So, three of the five nominees this year for Best Costume, all the costumes came from this place Angels.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:38.080
 It's been supplying Hollywood film costumes since 1940, since the 1940s.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:43.960
 So I think it's first Oscar was in 1948 for Hamlet, and it's most recent as the Grand Budapest Hotel.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:47.080
 And it's just this one place in London that everyone goes to get costumes.

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:51.840
 And it's supplied my costume a few years going 2012 when I went as a Mayan.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:52.840
 Did it?

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:53.840
 Yeah.

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:54.840
 That wasn't in the article I read, actually.

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:55.840
 No.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:56.840
 It will be now.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:57.840
 They'll do an update.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.840
 That's got to go in.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:00.840
 Costumes.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:01.840
 Yeah.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:02.840
 Yeah.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:09.160
 Did you see in the news this week that in Game of Thrones, John Snow's cape is made out of an Ikea rug.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.160
 No.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.160
 That's so funny.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.160
 To present the Channel 4 news.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:16.160
 Oh, no.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.160
 Here we go.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:27.160
 It's a liberating ignorance, Fianna.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.720
 I've never seen it, but do they all have capes with the quintessentially Ikea type patterns on them?

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:29.720
 Yeah.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:30.720
 That's the ladder that's going up the wall.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:31.720
 It's just a lot of billy butt cases.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.720
 No, because there's one bit missing, and that's a key scene in the TV series.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:40.360
 And the other big Game of Thrones news is that there was a big battle this week, not too

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:44.760
 much for Spiler, and it featured half of all the stunt performers in the UK.

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:45.760
 Wow.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:52.280
 And most of them were set on fire, and they beat the world record for most people set on fire

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.280
 at one time.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.280
 That's amazing.

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:58.920
 Presumably, the officially recorded most people on fire.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:03.680
 Well, Guinness doesn't recognise a record, but they, people in the industry, kind of know

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:04.680
 what the record was.

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:09.640
 They think it was, there were 13 burning actors in "Saving Private Ryan", and in Braveheart

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:13.360
 there were 18 people who were partially burned, so they were kind of the record.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:19.720
 They've gone up to 20 people set on fire at the same time, or 73 people set on fire over

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:20.720
 the course of a show.

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:21.720
 Bloody hell.

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.720
 Are they all okay?

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:27.320
 They are, but it's quite weird, because they put this gel on you, and they set fire to

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:29.960
 you, and the gel kind of keeps the heat away from you.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.960
 But you can't breathe while it's happening, otherwise you breathe in the fire.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:36.920
 So you have to hold your breath for like 30 seconds.

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:39.800
 And it's like doing an underwater scene apart from it's much more dangerous, because if

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.560
 you breathe in, you're just going to breathe in fire.

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.560
 This is insane.

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:46.560
 Surely we have CGI that can replicate fire that doesn't involve people having to inhale

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:47.560
 flame.

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:50.400
 I think the old ways are the best.

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.400
 Yeah.

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.600
 It's exactly the opposite of an underwater scene, James.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:57.040
 They're just sort of picking up on that.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.040
 Yeah.

00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:59.040
 You're right.

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.040
 Yeah.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.720
 But yeah, and the, apparently one big problem is after it's finished, after they've put

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:06.440
 you out, you kind of lie on the floor, and you have to lie there for a few minutes,

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:10.040
 because if you stand up, you might get re-ignited by accident, and that's one of the

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:15.680
 most dangerous things, because there's a lot of fire around, and this sounds like a ridiculous

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:16.680
 programme.

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.680
 They don't have any of that on the channel for news.

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:25.320
 Well, one good thing is that IKEA stuff is often flame retarded, so that might be a good,

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:26.320
 you know, use for that.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.320
 That's good.

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.320
 I watch one.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:32.920
 So John Snow could have put everyone out with his cape on my one.

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:41.320
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:46.880
 Okay, my fact this week is that Switzerland has 18 living ex-presidents.

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:51.200
 Okay, I think that's quite a lot.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.200
 It's cute.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.200
 Yeah.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.200
 Because how many ex-prime ministers do we got?

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.200
 Four or five?

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.200
 Yeah.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.200
 Four.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.200
 We've got major, Blair, Brown, Cameron.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.200
 That's it.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.200
 Yeah.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.200
 Yeah.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.200
 Four.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:07.080
 I want to wrap in that, it was Italy with prime ministers, looks like they've got ten who

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.080
 are still living.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.080
 Wow, really?

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:10.080
 Yeah.

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:15.560
 But Italy goes through governments like I go through Pants, what's every couple of years?

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:21.280
 But with a huge amount of corruption along the way.

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:25.920
 But Switzerland, it is a bit of a cheat, because their presidency is very unusual, and

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:30.880
 they only have like a one year president each time, and it rotates with everyone that

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:32.960
 who's in the cabinet.

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:37.760
 So all you have to do is get elected into the cabinet, and then wait your turn to everyone

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:40.360
 else has become president, and then you'll automatically become president.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:41.360
 You're so cool.

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:45.240
 And also, there's no maximum number of times that you can be president, so you can just

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:48.520
 sit there, and it's like the record is six times.

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:51.360
 And there are quite a few people who are currently in the cabinet who are just waiting

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:52.360
 for another girl.

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:53.360
 Yeah.

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.000
 What are they doing, other stuff as well?

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 No.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 They're not sitting there.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.800
 I was just sitting there in the mountains.

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.280
 But you don't get any extra power at all as president, do you?

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:06.040
 So they've just got this rotating council of seven, who are all exactly on a par.

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:07.880
 And then you just get to be cool president for a year.

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:09.040
 It's like a children's game.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:13.760
 It's a bit like, I don't know if this is like this, but it sounds a bit like, do they

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:17.840
 have like a council in Star Wars, which is a bit like that, like a council of jedis?

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:21.840
 Oh, the council of jedis, yes, yeah, yeah, there's a thing like that, yeah, yeah, that's

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:22.840
 in the prequel.

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:27.520
 It's in Phantom Menace, so it's a Samuel L. James, and that's the one, if you're going

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:35.400
 to watch one, that's the one, Samuel L. Jackson, and Yoda, there's a new, I think it's a new species

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:38.000
 of bat that has been named after Yoda.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 Yes, sir.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 Yeah.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.760
 And there was a headline about it in the Times a few days ago, and it said named after Yoda,

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:46.760
 new bat has been.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:47.760
 That was the headline.

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:48.760
 Oh, wow.

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:49.760
 That's amazing.

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:54.560
 And so the president is what you might call primus into parades, which obviously I don't

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:56.760
 need to explain what that is to Dan.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:01.160
 But it is, it's the first among equals, so everyone's equal, but they're kind of, they take

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:05.360
 the ceremonial, you know, it's, it's like Dan hosting the podcast.

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:06.360
 Yeah.

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:07.360
 Yeah.

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.360
 It's a bit, it's a bit of power.

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.360
 It's not quite that.

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:15.840
 I would say Dan's the fourth among equals.

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:21.040
 And they can go on state visits, but technically they don't call them state visits because

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.800
 of this equality between all of the cabinet.

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:27.720
 And so if one of them came to Britain on a state visit, we would call it that, but they

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:28.720
 wouldn't call it that.

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.240
 They just call it a foreign visit.

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:34.880
 I think it would be funny if all seven of them had to come and sit on the same chair whenever

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:35.880
 they had to do a state visit.

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:36.880
 That would be amazing.

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:37.880
 And I would watch that.

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:40.960
 And they have to answer in one voice when they're answering questions on the press, like

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:41.960
 in that improv game.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:42.960
 Yeah.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:43.960
 At the same time.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.120
 Or the other improv game where you say one word at a time.

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:47.120
 Yeah.

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.120
 I could do that one.

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:51.120
 So do you think that's how they decide policy is they play that one word at a time

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:52.120
 game?

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:53.720
 Well, let's try it for British policy.

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:59.480
 We should make yeties illegal.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:00.480
 There we go.

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:01.480
 We've got a policy already.

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:02.480
 Damn it.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:03.480
 Sorry.

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.480
 Damn it.

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:05.480
 He screwed yourself up.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:06.480
 Yeah.

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:07.480
 Oh man.

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:09.480
 That's what they'd never been seen.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:10.480
 That is incredible.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.160
 So you said, yeah, two people have held the post six times.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.840
 One of them, the record is being a cabinet minister for 31 years.

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:17.840
 Yeah.

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:18.840
 Wow.

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:19.840
 Third of a year is just sitting on a cabinet.

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:20.840
 They're not just doing that.

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.840
 They're making policy.

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.120
 They're working very hard.

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:25.120
 Absolutely.

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:27.720
 No one's disputing the might of the Swiss state.

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:28.720
 Yeah.

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:29.720
 That's important that we say that.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.640
 But they, yeah, they maintain their other job, right?

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:35.480
 Like the president in 2014, their job was also being foreign minister.

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.160
 They didn't stop being foreign minister.

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.800
 That took up most of their time.

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.320
 That's their main job as it were.

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:42.520
 Presidency was a sort of sideline.

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:45.960
 So I've been researching ex-presidents in general a bit.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:46.960
 Okay.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:50.400
 So did you know that Joe Biden can never drive a car again?

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.400
 No.

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:52.400
 He's not that impressive.

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:53.400
 No.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.400
 But he has been ex-vice president.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.400
 Right.

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:58.640
 So ex-presidents and vice-presidents are not allowed to drive after they leave the White House.

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:02.640
 But are you using ex-presidents as a catch all term to refer to presidents and vice-presidents?

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:03.640
 Yeah.

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.640
 Because I'm sure that is what the vice-presidents do.

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:06.640
 Yeah.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:10.320
 I've been the vice-presidents of the United States of America.

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:13.280
 It's very useful on the lecture circuit.

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:16.800
 And this isn't a law either, but it is a secret service rule, as it were.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.520
 As in the secret service says, well, we really think you shouldn't drive.

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:23.040
 And most people basically stick to it because someone else is driving you around, I guess.

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:27.800
 But George Bush, W, drives around his family farm with a truck and that's about as far as

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:28.800
 he's allowed to drive.

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:32.200
 Are they looked after for the rest of their life by the secret service?

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:34.600
 You get a secret service protection for the rest of your life.

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:35.600
 Right.

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.880
 Is that the same with Prime Ministers, do you think?

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:42.920
 I think if you started a war in Iraq, you have a lot of security forever.

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:45.760
 I think if you're Gordon Brown, you just know.

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:49.080
 A policeman might ring out once a month to check your alright.

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.640
 Because David Cameron was at wilderness when we were there, wasn't he?

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:52.640
 Yeah.

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:54.040
 And he had some goons around.

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:55.040
 How many he did, yeah.

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.040
 He did.

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:57.040
 But I missed him.

00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:58.040
 Ah.

00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:59.040
 I know.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:01.040
 We normally catch off at those things.

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.040
 We normally catch off at those things.

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:08.120
 Guys, is there something everyone knows about Switzerland, that what is the capital?

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.120
 Oh.

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.120
 Bern.

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:11.120
 I think there are five.

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:12.120
 Whoa.

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:13.120
 Yeah.

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.120
 I think it's the pub quiz.

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.640
 I think it's like the cabinet.

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:19.560
 There are loads of capitals, and none of them is more important.

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:23.400
 Or they each become the capital on a regular basis.

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:24.400
 Nice.

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.400
 You're all wrong.

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:26.400
 It doesn't have a capital.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.400
 I didn't.

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.400
 That's why I didn't answer, because there is none.

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:30.400
 Okay.

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.400
 So obviously, everyone thinks that Bern is the capital of Switzerland, but I just had no

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:38.040
 idea that it has no official capital, so its constitution doesn't mention it.

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.640
 Is the defacto capital, isn't it?

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:43.820
 It's a defacto capital, but there was a committee was set up by this seven-person

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:49.940
 council in 2002 to actually start work on making Bern the proper capital.

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:53.420
 And then it was suspended in 2004 and not resumed since, because it was too difficult

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:54.420
 a job.

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.500
 All I'm saying is, if you're in a pub quiz and they ask you

00:20:56.500 --> 00:21:01.220
 that question, go for my answer, not Anna's, because one, you'll get the point.

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:04.420
 And two, it'll take you a long time to write about this council in 2002.

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:07.220
 Yeah, and they don't give you much room sometimes, aren't they?

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:08.220
 Sorry, is it Bern?

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:09.220
 Am I saying Bern in this pub quiz?

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:10.220
 I think Bern in the pub quiz, yeah.

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:14.860
 But, if I answered that, will really Geneva is the financial capital and Lausanne is the

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:18.100
 industrial capital and Bern is the political capital and there are a couple of others, would

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:19.100
 I get the point?

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:20.100
 No.

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:21.100
 You can only put one answer down.

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:26.180
 But otherwise you could put every word that's ever been invented as the answer to every

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:27.180
 question.

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:28.180
 Oh, yeah.

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:31.540
 They never give you that long.

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:35.180
 Just because this is about Switzerland's government, it is unbelievable, their system

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:43.740
 of referenda. And so, in the past 20 years, they've had more than 180 referendums or referenda.

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:48.620
 The runner-up is Ireland, which has had 22 and Latvia then, which has had 8.

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:52.060
 They just have them constantly about everything, yes, bizarre.

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:56.620
 And one of the ones they had, for instance, was the one in 1959, as to whether women should

00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:59.580
 be allowed to vote and they voted that down.

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:03.420
 So that was a referendum that only men could take part in, because women still couldn't

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:05.060
 vote in 1959.

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:09.260
 This men in Switzerland voted against women getting the vote and they didn't get into 1971.

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:16.060
 So all you need is 100,000 signatures from registered voters in order to have the referendum.

00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:19.980
 So that's why it can happen so easily, it's just people need to sign up.

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:26.660
 There was a party that tried to have a referendum called the APPP and they were trying to ban

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:31.260
 the use of PowerPoint in Switzerland.

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:37.660
 This, the APP claimed that 2.1 billion Swiss francs was being wasted on PowerPoint presentations

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:41.740
 from the sort of like taking people away from their jobs to see PowerPoint presentations

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:42.740
 and so on.

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:47.180
 They said 85% of workforce people saw no point in a PowerPoint presentation.

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:49.820
 So did they have a petition about that then?

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:50.820
 Yeah, I think they did.

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:55.220
 And I think they failed to get the 100,000 people to sign in.

00:22:55.220 --> 00:23:04.100
 What I was thinking is that their PowerPoint presentation, for short, would be the APPPPPP.

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:05.100
 That is great.

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:10.340
 That's like someone trying to do my initials and then really stammering, suddenly.

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:14.340
 So when you become a member of the party, you have to buy the party manifesto, which is

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:17.100
 set out in this book called the PowerPoint fallacy.

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:23.340
 And it's authored by the guy who found the party, who's called Mathias Poem.

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:25.020
 And he was asked in an interview.

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:28.300
 So is this just a promotional gimmick for your book?

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:31.940
 And he said, yes, it is a tool to promote my book.

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:34.380
 And then he said there's like further reasons for it doing it as well.

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:36.660
 But like, yeah, basically it was set up to sell his book.

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:37.660
 Cool.

00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:38.660
 Fair enough.

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:39.660
 At least he's honest.

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:40.660
 But that existed.

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:41.660
 That was a party.

00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:42.660
 Wow.

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:43.660
 Well, a party.

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:44.660
 One guy.

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:45.660
 One guy.

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:46.660
 That's true.

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:47.660
 Yeah, I don't know how many people sign up.

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:48.660
 I love my parties.

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:49.660
 I like that.

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:58.260
 OK, it is time to move on to fact number three.

00:23:58.260 --> 00:23:59.580
 And that is my fact.

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:04.980
 My fact this week is that a New Zealand scientist is planning to hunt for the Loch Ness monster

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:07.700
 inside of a cup.

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:09.900
 Quick, quick search.

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:11.140
 Or big cup.

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:12.140
 Yes, true.

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:13.940
 Actually, it's quite small.

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:14.940
 Small, messy.

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:15.940
 Yes.

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:16.940
 Oh, yeah.

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:18.260
 Yeah, no, it's a big, it's a large cup.

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:19.900
 It's a couple of liters.

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:20.900
 It's a few cups.

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:26.620
 Basically, the idea of this is that a New Zealand scientist, called Professor Neil Gammel,

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:32.580
 has been promoting this thing called E DNA or Edna.

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:38.620
 And the idea is that we can now, taking samples of water from various lakes and oceans and

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:44.580
 so on, can analyze the DNA that's found inside each cup and they're able to diagnose what

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:46.660
 animals are in there, what animals aren't in there.

00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:51.660
 If there's meant to be in there, it's a sort of new system of being able to count up fish

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:57.900
 and any ocean life of a specific area with accuracy from within just a bit of water.

00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:02.300
 The idea behind going to look for Nessie is he's effectively doing this as a publicity

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:05.020
 stunt to promote the idea of E DNA.

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:06.740
 This basically got picked up by the papers.

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:08.100
 This was never his intention.

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:12.220
 When he announced the idea that he wanted to do more stuff with E DNA, Cryptozoologist

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:15.100
 got in contact with him and said, could you do this for the Loch Ness?

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:18.100
 And he said, you probably could, but I'm not planning to do that.

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:21.980
 The paper is kind of reported that he said, yes, that's what I'm planning on doing.

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:25.580
 And as a result, when he'd go to schools and everywhere else to talk about it, children

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:28.180
 would ask him specifically about Loch Ness.

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:30.820
 And using Loch Ness, he started explaining the procedures.

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:32.780
 And people just way more interested generally.

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:37.300
 So he's now up for the idea of doing the Loch Ness thing because people are actually listening.

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:38.300
 It's insane.

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:39.300
 You have to do it via the Loch Ness monster.

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:44.540
 Do you know what he's trying next is organising a Swiss referendum?

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:50.620
 So the other thing about it is that there's now a massive library of fish DNA because obviously

00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:54.220
 it's no good finding a bit of DNA and then thinking, well, what did this come from when you

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:57.500
 don't know the DNA of, let's say, a cod.

00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:02.780
 So there was a massive drive organised by a scientist who is called Jesse Alsubel.

00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:07.860
 They did 500 expeditions and they got basically thousands and thousands of specimens of animals

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:09.500
 from all over the oceans.

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:13.620
 So now they have this huge library of tens of thousands of fish DNA samples and now they

00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:15.420
 can actually match it up to something.

00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:16.900
 So that was the big finger printing drive.

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:17.900
 That's good.

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:21.380
 Yeah, because otherwise you've just got a bit of DNA that's completely used for this.

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:22.380
 Yeah, this is nasty.

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:23.380
 Good bit nasty, yeah, sure.

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:24.380
 It could be anything.

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:25.380
 Yeah.

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:28.580
 You really need some kind of reference system.

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:32.420
 It's a hard thing to research because I kept getting articles about, like, world's

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:33.860
 oldest women dies.

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:36.700
 You just keep getting articles about people called Edna, don't you?

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:38.500
 Yeah, yeah.

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:42.020
 So one of the ways it's going to be important is because we need to be able to keep

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:45.740
 count of our fish and know where they are because fish stocks are being depleted.

00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:47.820
 And we have a bunch of ways of counting fish.

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:51.980
 I was reading an article I think it was in the Atlantic about how a lot of scientists and

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:56.620
 fishermen still just do the traditional way of counting fish, which is basically that

00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:59.700
 your ownership, you've, what is this?

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:00.940
 It's just a traditional way.

00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:06.020
 It must be just one, two, three fish, two fish, three fish, four, yeah.

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:08.660
 It is this, but they spend months and months out there.

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:13.100
 So in Massachusetts, these guys go out in a boat and they have a conveyor belt set up on

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:17.560
 their boat and they get this huge net and then they plop all these fish onto the conveyor

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:18.560
 belt.

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:22.900
 And then someone's job is to pick a fish off a conveyor belt, shout what species it is, throw

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:24.900
 it into the right species pile.

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:29.460
 Someone else's job is to shove it up against a measuring board and automatically a magnet

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:30.460
 measure challenge.

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:31.700
 It's like a mugshot of it.

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:32.700
 Yeah, it is.

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:33.700
 It's exactly like that, yeah.

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:35.460
 But then do we eat these fish?

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:40.340
 They throw them back in, well, they weigh them, so the question is, how do they know that

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:43.060
 it's not the same, you know, cards the next time?

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:44.060
 They don't even explain.

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:49.580
 Hey, Jerry, this one looks a bit like that one from three weeks ago.

00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:54.180
 Throwing them back alive still, so they're putting them on the conveyor belt, still alive.

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:57.180
 They're shoving them up against a measuring board, still alive.

00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:00.900
 They plop them on a set of weighing skills, still alive and then they're sent back down

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:05.340
 and no one believes them.

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:09.260
 You're right, that's the UFO of the fish world, isn't it?

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:13.180
 So the reason that it's really hard to break out of this system, which is actually not as

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:18.060
 efficient as, for instance, using a drone to count all the fish, or maybe using a DNA monitoring

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:22.540
 system, is that it's kind of like the thing Andy mentioned, it's a referencing problem.

00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:28.220
 So because we started counting fish this way in the 1950s or '60s, the only way we know

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:32.420
 how many fish there are compared to before is by comparing it to the previous house.

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:33.420
 Oh, right.

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:35.020
 So we just have to keep on doing this system.

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:38.540
 If we suddenly do a new system, we'll find way more fish, and we won't know how to compare

00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:40.180
 it to how many there were before.

00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:41.180
 So we're stuck with it.

00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:42.180
 We're stuck with guys.

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:46.260
 What we need to do is come up with a new system and then do them both together for a few

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:47.260
 years.

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:51.420
 It's a really good idea, James, and then compare the difference.

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:54.540
 You should get on that committee.

00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:58.220
 I have a cryptozoology fact, because we're on Nessie.

00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:02.860
 So this is a story from the BBC, this was North Carolina last week, and it was about Bigfoot

00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:03.860
 then.

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:04.860
 Oh, I know.

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:05.860
 There was a sighting of Bigfoot.

00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:06.860
 Yeah.

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:07.860
 Hugely exciting.

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:09.980
 Group of Hunters called Bigfoot 9-1-1.

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:14.900
 They said they'd seen Bigfoot only for a local shaman to get in touch saying it was me.

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:15.900
 Yeah.

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:21.140
 I was walking around in a suit made of animal skins, and he's called Gawain.

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:24.300
 But the man who wrote the group said on Facebook, "I want to address the recent revelation

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:26.820
 from the gentleman that stated that I saw him in the woods."

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:29.700
 This is quite a fascinating story, but there are a few problems with it.

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:34.060
 Number one, the creature that I saw was 8-foot tall with stringy matted hair.

00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:37.420
 The gentleman in the picture does not appear tall, too.

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:41.260
 The creature moved with speed unmatched by any human.

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:42.260
 So…

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:45.380
 But the thing is that Gawain McGregor was there looking for Bigfoot himself.

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:46.380
 Yes.

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:51.620
 He wanders around addressing an animal skins, reciting what he says is a Sasquatch prayer.

00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:56.300
 And he says that he himself has met Bigfoot before, but has now been mistaken for Bigfoot.

00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:57.300
 Are you guys ready?

00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:01.980
 Are they just seeing each other constantly and thinking they're sighting Bigfoot?

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:03.980
 They did find Nessie this year.

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:04.980
 Did they?

00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:06.140
 They found A Nessie.

00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:12.020
 It was a 9-meter model of the Loch Ness Monster built in 1969 for a Sherlock Holmes movie

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:16.780
 and sank to the bottom of Loch Ness, and they found it with an underwater robot.

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:18.260
 They took a photo of it.

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:19.260
 That's amazing.

00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:20.260
 That's really cool.

00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:21.260
 Yeah, that's awesome.

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:25.740
 Did they get to anyone get excited initially or were they all sensible people who knew what

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:26.740
 was happening?

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:27.740
 Next, he's dead.

00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:35.540
 Do you know you must know about Robert Rines, the Nessie Hunter, who I'd never heard

00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:39.660
 of, but is really cool, so he's a proper scientist.

00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:41.460
 He dies not that long ago.

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:45.780
 You're already looking skeptical, Andy, but he made massive contributions to science

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:51.220
 in America, but was also obsessed with the Loch Ness Monster and convinced it existed.

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:54.300
 So he had 800 patents.

00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:59.220
 He developed this way to improve radar and sonar images, and now it's used in Patriot

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:01.780
 Missiles, which they use in the military.

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:04.900
 He found the Titanic wreck, and he found the wreck of the Bismarck.

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:08.900
 He was one of the people on that team who uncovered the Titanic.

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:11.780
 He made massive leaps in ultrasound imaging.

00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:15.820
 He contributed to eye surgery, but he's just remembered for the fact that he was obsessed

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:17.500
 with the Loch Ness Monster.

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:23.340
 And so, for instance, he hired a perfumer once to concoct the kind of scent that would attract

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:27.220
 a creature like the Loch Ness Monster, and he trained dolphins to find it.

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:31.340
 So he got cameras on dolphins' heads and trained them to be able to find Nessie.

00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:32.340
 But yeah, it's so weird.

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:34.140
 He's this really cool, legit guy.

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:37.180
 He once played a violin duet with Albert Einstein.

00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:42.380
 He was a Harvard scientist, but who also kept on trying to find the Loch Ness Monster?

00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:43.380
 It's weird, isn't it?

00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:44.380
 That's weird.

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:45.380
 It's because my hero.

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:48.300
 He painted a form of chopsticks with hinges on them as well.

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:50.860
 W. My Hero.

00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:55.780
 I was reading that in, this is about in 2012, and I couldn't find an update on this.

00:31:55.780 --> 00:32:04.500
 But in America and Louisiana, Christian schools that are sort of, you know, sort of believe

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:10.020
 that dinosaurs existed at the same time as humans, creationists, sort of schools.

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:14.460
 They started teaching that the Loch Ness Monster is real, a solid scientific fact to help

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:17.140
 back up all of their creationist stuff.

00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:19.660
 So there's an ACE textbook.

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:26.300
 This is Biology 1099, Accelerated Christian Education Inc, who published it, and it reads,

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:27.900
 "Our dinosaurs are alive today.

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:30.340
 Scientists are becoming more convinced of their existence.

00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:32.620
 Have you heard of the Loch Ness Monster in Scotland?"

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:37.540
 Nessie, for sure, has been recorded on sonar from a small submarine described by eye witnesses

00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:38.540
 and photographed by others.

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:41.060
 Nessie appears to be a pleasy of sore.

00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:44.020
 So that's actually taught as fact within these schools.

00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:45.020
 It's quite cool.

00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:46.540
 I didn't know that Nessie is not quite cool.

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:47.540
 It's not cool.

00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:48.540
 Exactly.

00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:51.820
 Yeah, the leesia sores, I don't think the dinosaurs really, what?

00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:53.820
 So that is a massive mistake they've made there.

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:54.820
 Yeah.

00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:55.820
 They're not dinosaurs?

00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:57.300
 No, but in the same way that teradactyls were not dinosaurs.

00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:01.820
 Yeah, but don't put sore on the end of your name and not be a dino.

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:06.340
 Yeah, but dino is not on the front of the name, yeah, but sore is on the end of everything.

00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:08.220
 Also, Tyrannosaur is a dinosaur.

00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:09.220
 Yeah.

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:10.220
 Yeah.

00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:11.220
 Yeah.

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:12.220
 Yeah.

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:21.940
 I mean, if you're not sure what Twitter has been telling you about, it's been weeks.

00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:24.220
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show.

00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:25.220
 That is Andy.

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:30.820
 My fact is that your liver grows and shrinks by 40% every 24 hours.

00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:33.020
 I am in love with the liver.

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:34.020
 Yeah, that's great fact.

00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:35.020
 Wow.

00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:36.020
 What a thing.

00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:39.580
 Okay, so this was based on a New York Times article I read, it was just a sort of feature

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:44.340
 on the, it wasn't really a news article as such, now breaking news, you've got a liver,

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:45.820
 but it is so cool.

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:48.380
 So the liver grows and shrinks every day.

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:52.420
 It's got its own internal clock, so it knows what time to do it.

00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:57.260
 And it's, it grows and shrinks in accordance with day and night, more or less.

00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:03.180
 So they tested mice and mice, their liver expands after dark and then it shrinks back

00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:07.300
 when daylight is approaching, but that's because mice are nocturnal.

00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:11.540
 And obviously humans are dying and also our liver grows in the morning and then it shrinks

00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:12.540
 at night.

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:14.260
 Do you think it depends like when you go to bed?

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:17.900
 So I got to bed extremely like and dangos bed relatively early.

00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:18.900
 Yeah.

00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:21.500
 So do you think his liver expands earlier than mine?

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:22.500
 Maybe.

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:25.540
 So your liver might be different sizes now, just because of your own body clocks.

00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:26.540
 That's cool.

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:29.900
 Does, would my liver get jet lag when I go to Australia?

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:32.700
 I think all of you gets jet lag.

00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:36.860
 Does that mean that there are British people walking around Australia with tiny liver?

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:39.540
 Getting pickled on the beer much quicker.

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:41.060
 I think that's what we're saying, yeah.

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:45.260
 And Australians here have massive liver, so no, that's not what we're saying.

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:46.980
 They have the same problem, don't they?

00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:48.180
 They would have the same problem.

00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:49.180
 Yeah.

00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:51.420
 So it's the size of a chihuahua.

00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:52.420
 At which stage?

00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:56.580
 Chihuahua's don't grow and shrink 40% during the day.

00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:57.580
 Full size.

00:34:57.580 --> 00:34:58.580
 Small full size chihuahua.

00:34:58.580 --> 00:34:59.580
 Hang on.

00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:00.580
 When the liver's at full size.

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:02.300
 Chihuahua's are like, they're big, right?

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:04.100
 Well, they're not as big as a great date.

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:05.420
 I said a small chihuahua there.

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:07.460
 I know, but just picture it very quickly.

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:09.300
 A chihuahua inside me right now.

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:10.300
 Yeah.

00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:11.300
 I'm going to really tie a chihuahua.

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:12.300
 I think you mean a chihuahua without the tail?

00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:13.300
 Or legs.

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:14.300
 Or legs.

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:16.860
 They're the size of the Mexican state of Chihuahua.

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:17.860
 Right.

00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:23.980
 OK, that is based on a mental floss article, so that is a mental floss is very reliable,

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:24.980
 so I don't know what I'm saying.

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:25.980
 They are, yeah.

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:26.980
 Yeah.

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:27.980
 I believe that.

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:28.980
 A chihuahua.

00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:29.980
 Yeah.

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:30.980
 Oh, please.

00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:31.980
 OK.

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:32.980
 Chihuahua's out that big.

00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:33.980
 They're bigger than that.

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:34.980
 Yeah.

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:41.980
 They're just destroying a really tiny dog that has some mouse dressed up as a chihuahua.

00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:42.980
 Yeah.

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:43.980
 I just think it's amazing.

00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:44.980
 Yeah.

00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:45.980
 It's incredible.

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:46.980
 It is very awesome.

00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:50.300
 Is it thought to be because it's so that it can get used to rejuvenating?

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:51.300
 Is that right?

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:54.660
 So that if it's, you know, flooded with lots of poisonous stuff, at least it's able

00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:57.300
 to like shrink and rebuild itself constantly.

00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:00.100
 It is like, basically, a bit of X-man, hasn't it?

00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:01.100
 Yeah.

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:03.780
 Because it's really part of everyone's got this part of the body that's regenerating

00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:04.780
 all the time.

00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:05.780
 Yeah.

00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:06.780
 Oh, yeah.

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:07.780
 So we're like part wolverine just in our liver.

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:08.780
 Yeah.

00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:09.780
 And we mentioned before that--

00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:10.780
 Oh, wolverine is all liver.

00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:11.780
 Yes.

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:12.780
 Wow.

00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:13.780
 That's good.

00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:18.380
 So we said before that if you chop your liver down to a quarter of the size, it will regenerate.

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:19.380
 Within a few weeks.

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:20.380
 Yeah.

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:21.380
 It's full size.

00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:24.660
 And I think you said that if you put a chihuahua's liver into a great day, and it will grow

00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:26.260
 to the size of a great day's liver.

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:27.260
 Yes.

00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:28.260
 Is what?

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:29.260
 Mad.

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:31.580
 So you can donate half of your liver to somebody.

00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:32.580
 Yeah.

00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:34.340
 And they within a few weeks will have a full liver.

00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:35.340
 And so will you.

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:38.060
 So we only need one liver for the whole human race, really.

00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:39.060
 Yes.

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:41.860
 It's like that Greek myth where they share one eye.

00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:46.700
 But if you left a bit of eye behind in the socket and then the eye just multiplied.

00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:51.100
 Halon doesn't Prometheus when he's chained to the mountain in the myth, gets his liver torn

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:53.700
 out by a bird every day and then it grows back.

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:54.700
 I think they did know about--

00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:55.700
 Oh.

00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:56.700
 So they must have known--

00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:57.700
 Hang on.

00:36:57.700 --> 00:36:58.700
 They can't have known.

00:36:58.700 --> 00:36:59.700
 How would they know?

00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:00.700
 How could they know?

00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:03.620
 Prometheus gets his liver torn out every day and then the next day it's grown back and

00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:05.100
 the bird tears it out again and that's his punishment.

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:06.100
 Yeah, yeah.

00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:07.100
 How did they know?

00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:08.100
 That they must have known.

00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:09.700
 I don't think they did.

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:10.700
 You think it's a coincidence?

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:11.900
 I think it's a coincidence.

00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:12.900
 I'm calling it.

00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:18.500
 So did you know that Tim Cook, who's the current CEO of Apple, wanted to donate his liver

00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:22.820
 or 50% of it to Steve Jobs when he needed a liver donation.

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:27.980
 And Tim Cook said that he's only been shouted out by Steve Jobs three or four times in their

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:28.980
 entire career.

00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:30.980
 And they worked very closely for many, many years.

00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:34.260
 And one of the times was that when he knocked on his door and said, can I give you some of

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:35.260
 my liver?

00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:38.180
 And Steve Jobs said, no, don't be an idiot.

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:39.180
 You shouldn't have to do that for me.

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:40.180
 But he shouted at him.

00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:43.500
 Yeah, apparently you got angry because I think Tim Cook was really insistent and said, I

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:44.500
 wanted to donate.

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:45.500
 Was it in his hand?

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:46.500
 Yeah.

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:47.500
 Oh, my God.

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:50.740
 You were dripping it on my floor, get out of here.

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:51.740
 What is this?

00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:52.740
 Chop liver?

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:59.300
 So Steve Jobs actually had a liver transplant in 2008, or he had a liver transplant

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:00.460
 in the 2000s.

00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:05.860
 And the doctor who transplanted his liver later bought his house, which is quite nice.

00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:11.620
 I went onto the old QI forums where we do our research for TV show and found a discussion

00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:18.580
 between me and Andy about whether we could eat human livers and not die, because there's

00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:22.060
 an old fact that if you eat a polar bear's liver, you'll die because it's got so much

00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:24.020
 vitamin A in it.

00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:29.220
 And so we worked out how much vitamin A there was per gram in a human liver, which is

00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:34.020
 575 international units, and then how heavy a liver was.

00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:39.260
 And then what the maximum single intake dose for vitamin A was in a human.

00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:43.860
 And we worked out that if you ate one and a third raw livers in a single sitting, you would

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:46.580
 probably die of vitamin A poisoning.

00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:49.180
 It might be a bit different if you cooked it, but not too different.

00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:53.500
 So if Hannibal Lecter, for instance, had two human livers in one sitting, he would die

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:54.500
 of vitamin A poisoning.

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:57.780
 But that's why they never show that scene in the film, because they knew it would be

00:38:57.780 --> 00:38:58.780
 unrealistic.

00:38:58.780 --> 00:38:59.780
 Show me eating two livers.

00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:00.780
 Yeah.

00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:04.260
 Well, the other thing that would be realistic in the film is if you eat too much vitamin A,

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:08.180
 your body stops being able to star it and you turn orange.

00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:11.900
 So the police should have been able to find them by just looking for an orange person.

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:12.900
 Wow.

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:18.340
 Did you know that you can grow a baby in a liver.

00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:19.340
 Like human baby?

00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:24.380
 Four babies have been born, not out of a womb, but out of a liver.

00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:26.620
 Deliberately or ectopically, right?

00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:27.620
 Well, nearly.

00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:32.020
 So normally, egg gets fertilised, moves down into womb.

00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:36.900
 Sometimes egg gets stuck in fallopian tube, problem, it's called nectopic pregnancy.

00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:43.380
 Sometimes, one in 100,000 times, the egg just falls out of the fallopian tube and it wanders

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:44.900
 off through the body.

00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:51.420
 In the very rare cases where the fertilised egg lands in the abdomen in the liver, it's

00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:53.180
 got a massive blood supply there.

00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:55.900
 The only thing it lacks is the muscular wall of the womb.

00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:59.740
 So it's not as well protected, but no placenta though.

00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:00.740
 So how do they...

00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:01.740
 It grows.

00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:04.140
 Because food comes through it, this is incredible.

00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:05.140
 I know.

00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:06.140
 Because it does so much.

00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:08.180
 The liver does like 500 jobs, isn't it?

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:09.180
 It does 500 jobs.

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:12.340
 It's like the jaw jaws bomb of the human body, isn't it?

00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:16.580
 And so the last time was in 2003 in South Africa, doctors literally went into a woman's

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:19.300
 liver and pulled out a healthy baby.

00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:20.300
 What?

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:22.740
 That is one of the best facts I've ever heard.

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:23.740
 That's incredible.

00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:29.380
 The question for the baby as well, half of its day, it's flat, gets 50% bigger.

00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:37.660
 Okay, that is it, that is all of our facts.

00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:39.020
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:41.860
