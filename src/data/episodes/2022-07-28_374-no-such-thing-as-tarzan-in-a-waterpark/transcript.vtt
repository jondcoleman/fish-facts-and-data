00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:16.800
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.320
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.040
 a weekly podcast coming to you

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.400
 from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.500
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.640
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.080
 Andrew Hunton Murray and James Harkin.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.320
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.120
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.200
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.200
 Starting with you, Andy.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.160
 - My fact is that the founder of the UK's

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.360
 first electric vehicle forecourt

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.840
 was named after a service station.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.600
 - Which service station?

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.440
 - This is a man.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.280
 - Was he named TB?

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.960
 - He wasn't, he was named Toddington.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.000
 - A classic.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.160
 - Kind of like Paddington Bear actually

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.360
 being named after Paddington Station,

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.360
 but he's Toddington.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.960
 - Was he founded that service station

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.080
 like Paddington Bear was found in?

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.280
 - Yeah, he came from South America

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.800
 with a jar of marmalade and no, he wasn't.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.280
 It's a really weird story.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.120
 So he's a guy called Toddington Harper

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.620
 and he is named after the M1 Toddington Services.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:23.120
 He is actually, I believe the child of some solar pioneers.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.960
 His parents were involved in solar electricity

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.880
 when they were younger.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.440
 And he actually has a brother

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.960
 who is named Heston after Heston services.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.560
 So both boys in this family are named after service stations.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.400
 - That's amazing.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.120
 - His mum just said, his mum was interviewed.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.200
 There was this piece in the mail

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.480
 about this electric forecourt service station thing.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.000
 And his mum said they were driving back from the hospital.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.200
 They didn't have a name for him

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.760
 and they drove through Heston services.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:47.760
 This was with their first boy

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.140
 and they thought Heston's the name.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.080
 And then a few years later, they carried it on.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.960
 - They were on Home Trudes on Radio 4 talking about this.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.400
 And they said that they were driving down the M4

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.840
 and they just started reading out the names of places

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.320
 they passed to see if any of these would be a decent name.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.320
 So they read out Roe Hampton, Putney, Siemens, Honeywell.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.720
 That was the Heston, that was the first one.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.480
 - So did Toddington get his,

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.800
 because that was just a theme

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.400
 or was that a different route they took home

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.840
 after that hospital?

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.600
 - So what happened was they called the first one Heston

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.520
 and that is the first service station on the M4.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.720
 And according to the mother,

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.320
 she said a friend of mine said,

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.680
 "If you've called your first son

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.680
 "after the first service station on the M4,

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.520
 "how about calling your second son

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.320
 "after the first service station on the M1?"

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.480
 Right, so that's what she said.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.840
 But Toddington isn't the first service station on the M1.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.800
 The first service station on the M1 is London Gateway.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.320
 So he should have been called London Gateway, I thought.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.560
 But London Gateway is a new name for this service station.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.280
 It's only been called that since 2000.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.440
 And really he should have been called Scratchwood.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.440
 - Nice.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.280
 - I think--

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.760
 - That's the first service station historically

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.760
 or the first one that you reached geographically.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.640
 - It's the first one as you leave London

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.560
 going north bound for the M1 or west bound for the M4.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.400
 - Right.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.000
 The first historically is between two.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.800
 I think you'd have to be called Watford Gap,

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.240
 which isn't great, or Newport Pagnell,

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.160
 which is quite a cool name, actually, would have been.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.400
 And there's this amazing website

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.400
 called MotorwayServicesOnline.co.uk.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.320
 I really think we should start doing a series

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.560
 of insanely good websites about really arcade subjects.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.120
 - Like ThatchInfo.com.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.520
 - Exactly.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.200
 The person who made this site has to get together

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.280
 with the person who made that one.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.040
 So they go very deep into the debate

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.400
 over whether Newport Pagnell

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.320
 or Watford Gap are the first service station.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.520
 It is Newport Pagnell.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.440
 It beat Watford Gap by about two weeks in 1960.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.560
 But it's got some other great stuff on it.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.400
 It has a whole page on the Lou of the Year Award

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.980
 because the Lou of the Year Award has a section

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.560
 about service stations.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.280
 And very sadly, it used to cover three

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.680
 for England, Scotland, and Wales,

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.080
 but they've had to scale back the awards.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.080
 - Are you talking about the Four Court Trader Awards

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.760
 because they have a Four Court Lou of the Year category?

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.920
 This is an award ceremony just for Four Courts

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:07.760
 and service stations and things.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.640
 - That's a completely different awards ceremony, Andy.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.080
 It's a very common confusion, though.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.480
 Go on, but presumably you want to talk about them,

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.600
 which is relatively unrelated, to be honest, but go on.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.480
 - Okay, well, they've got Best Four Court Lou of the Year

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.720
 as a category, and they've also got Best Coffee

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.020
 and Hot Beverages Outlet, and Best Car Care

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.300
 and Lubricants Outlet as a--

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.460
 - Wow, Best Lubricants.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.980
 - Is it car lubricants as well, though?

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.460
 It's just car care and then general lubrication.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.980
 - It must be car lubricants.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.280
 Otherwise, that is a very specialist award.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.580
 There's an author called David Lawrence.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.540
 I don't know if he's got anything to do with that website

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:42.380
 that you were talking about, Anna,

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.380
 but he is pretty much the UK expert on service stations.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.460
 He's written a couple of books about them.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.780
 And there was an interview with him

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.400
 where he said that he's racked up 11,000 miles

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.000
 of motorway driving and eating breakfast

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.760
 in over 100 service stations for his research.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.760
 And he said that he once spent Christmas

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.360
 in a travel lodge in a service station.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.160
 And they asked him what that was like,

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.560
 and he said it was a mixture of being

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.880
 in the midst of everyone's Christmas travels

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.120
 and also very alone.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.240
 - Oh, but worth it for the fame and glory

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.560
 that he's subsequently got.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.080
 - He said that he once stayed in a service station

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.540
 in a motel in the UK,

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.940
 and the bed hadn't been changed

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.460
 since the previous occupants had celebrated the wedding night.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.380
 And it still had confetti in the bed.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.000
 And goodness knows what else, probably lubricants.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.860
 - Actually, the travel lodge in Toddington's,

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.020
 so the service station that this guy is named after

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.300
 used to do this good thing,

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.120
 which I think all service stationers should,

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.900
 where they had a power nap scheme.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.460
 This is actually according to Alex Horn,

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.140
 who wrote this big article on service stations

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.060
 'cause he loves them,

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.160
 but you could rent a room for three hours.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.240
 And I don't know why that's not absolutely standard, right?

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.480
 When you get to a service station,

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.240
 so often you just have a half hour nap in your car.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.880
 - I think people don't like to do that

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.000
 because it might encourage like what in Japan

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.520
 you call love hotels where people just rent by the hour

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.960
 and go to check.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.960
 - Yes, I think that makes sense.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.560
 - Was that Alex Horn from Taskmaster?

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.680
 - Yes, he does a second string on his bow.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.720
 - He loves him, he loves him.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.020
 Actually, I found, I contacted him last night

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.220
 'cause I read that article too,

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.020
 and he was talking about one particularly great service station

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.820
 called Clacket Lane, it's in Clacket Lane.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.660
 And he was saying that as well as fun things they have there,

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.180
 like they've got Roman pottery

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.980
 that was found at the site on display,

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.660
 so you can see that while you're there,

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.300
 but they've also got a palm reading machine.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.780
 This is kind of like Zoltar.

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.300
 You put your palm into the machine,

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.380
 you're handed to the machine,

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.260
 and it tells you your future.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:45.340
 And you get this little ticket

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.760
 that tells you what your future's gonna be.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.440
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.480
 Interestingly, Clacket Lane as well,

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:55.760
 supposedly is the best place on the M25 to hitchhike,

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.480
 and that's according to Hitchwiki,

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.400
 which I'd never heard of, another fantastic website.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.880
 - Dan, were you googling how to get picked up

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.880
 at most of the servers?

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:04.720
 (laughing)

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.180
 And you still want to go on Hitchwiki.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.000
 (laughing)

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.560
 - Anyone fancy a power nap?

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.280
 - One good place where you could get picked up

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.840
 at a service station was Watford Gap.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.500
 Back in the day, when it was a place

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.300
 where lots of bands used to go,

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.380
 and apparently according to Francis Rossi of status quo,

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.580
 it used to be where groupies hung out,

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.180
 because they knew that all the bands

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.580
 would stop at Watford Gap

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.860
 on the way to a gig or back from a gig.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.660
 And so as well as going to the backstage door

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.340
 or going to the hotels or whatever,

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.580
 they used to hang out at Watford Gap services

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.620
 to see if they could pick up a rock star.

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:38.900
 - So great.

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.100
 - That's, it feels like such a high stakes game, doesn't it?

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.620
 'Cause you might pick up a rolling stone or something,

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.200
 or you might just spend your entire evening

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.260
 at the Watford Gap service.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:47.080
 (laughing)

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.360
 - On your 70 McDonald's,

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.480
 all you've met is van drivers so far.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.040
 But yeah, they all used to talk about it.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.360
 It became sort of famous.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.580
 And Ronnie Wood of Rolling Stones fame, obviously,

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:58.680
 said that apparently Jimi Hendrix

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.360
 thought that it was a nightclub.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.200
 So it was called the Blue Boar back then.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.920
 The cafe was called Blue Boar.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.440
 And he said Hendrix thought it was a nightclub

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.640
 because all of his fellow musicians

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.760
 used to go on about stopping up at the Blue Boar.

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:11.080
 So he was so excited to finally get there

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.560
 and find that it sold bad coffee.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.140
 And had a big car park.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:18.340
 And it doesn't even get very rated very highly

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:20.780
 in service station awards now.

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:23.340
 I learned from my favorite website, sadly.

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:27.180
 - Did you guys hear the song about the Watford Gap?

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:28.140
 - Yes. - No.

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.940
 - So this is by a folk singer called Roy Harper.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:32.540
 So he's a very famous folk musician

00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:34.660
 and he, there's a Led Zeppelin song

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:35.700
 called Hats Off to Roy Harper.

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.140
 He's a pretty big deal.

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.700
 He released a song called Watford Gap

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.620
 which was so rude about the Watford Gap

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:43.600
 that its owners kind of called in the lawyers.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.160
 And they, some people intervened

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.760
 and got it taken off the album.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.640
 So here are some of the lines from it.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:53.120
 Just about a mile from where the motorways all merge,

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.760
 you can view the national edifice,

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.440
 a monumental splurge.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.280
 It's the lonesome traveler's rock gut

00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.720
 or bacteria's revenge.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.040
 The great plastic spectacular descendant of Stonehenge.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:06.000
 The countryside is ravaged like a syphilitic whore.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.320
 Yodeling up the canyon is the dirty old Blue Boar.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.960
 And they didn't like it.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:14.020
 Watford Gap, Watford Gap, it's a load of crap.

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:15.900
 You can go there for a two hour nap

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:17.180
 but you might get the clap.

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.780
 That's what I would love for.

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:20.340
 - That's very strong.

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:23.740
 - The American pioneer of petrol stations

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:27.780
 was a man whose name was Sylvarnus Freelove Bowser.

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:29.460
 - Wow.

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:30.420
 - That was his name.

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:32.340
 - The head of Nintendo is called Bowser, isn't he?

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.140
 People send us that from time to time.

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:37.420
 Yeah, 'cause Bowser is also a character in...

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:39.460
 Did he always know about Mario Kart?

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:40.900
 - In Mario Kart, yeah.

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:42.500
 - So is the evil guy.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:45.520
 - I guess maybe some relation between Sylvarnus Freelove

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.600
 and the head of Nintendo, I don't know.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:51.400
 - Well, we're also talking about with this fact

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:52.880
 about electric cars, right?

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:56.280
 And so just as a connection to that,

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.600
 the Tesla, there's a lot of Easter eggs in the Tesla

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.200
 that sort of have been programmed either by Elon Musk

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.760
 or the nerds from within there.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:06.320
 And one of them is that while you're driving,

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.720
 if you rapidly press the autopilot button

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:12.860
 four times in a row, the street on your display

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.820
 will turn from the standard road

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:17.120
 into rainbow road from Mario Kart.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.180
 (laughing)

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.220
 - Wait a minute, but in rainbow road,

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:22.260
 my memory says that it's very easy

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:23.740
 to fall off that road, isn't it?

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:25.340
 - Yes, yeah.

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:26.900
 It's the most dangerous of tracks

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:29.500
 in the classic Mario Kart, yeah.

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:31.060
 - There was that thing which I was gonna do

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:33.900
 as a fact on this show that if you say open butthole,

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:38.300
 then it opens the thing that you use to charge the car up.

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:40.120
 - Like the voice activation system.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:40.960
 - Is that deliberate?

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:41.800
 That's an Easter egg.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.120
 It's not some accident 'cause it sounds like something.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:44.960
 (laughing)

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:45.800
 I don't know what.

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.360
 - Like bolt hole or something.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.200
 I don't know.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.080
 - God, I don't know if I want Easter eggs in my car.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.640
 You don't want to go, oh, maybe if you do three left turns

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.880
 in a row, the drive will be ejected or something.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.640
 (laughing)

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.480
 - Well, here's another one.

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:04.880
 If you tap the corner of the top main monitor, the T,

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.800
 if you tap it three times, it turns into a touchscreen

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.620
 and you can start drawing with a color palette.

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:12.660
 So you can just start doing whatever drawings you want.

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:14.380
 You have to do it as the passenger, obviously.

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:15.900
 This is not for the driver.

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.500
 And then you submit it afterwards to Tesla

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:20.220
 and they critique your drawing for you.

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:22.500
 - Wow, is that Elon Musk personally?

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:23.660
 Is that what he does now?

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:26.180
 He just sits in a study critiquing people's drawings.

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:27.140
 - It feels like that.

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:29.260
 And he sends you 10 million doge coins

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.040
 for the best one or something.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:35.980
 - I think the very first electric car was designed

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:39.880
 in 1839, so they didn't catch on at all

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.000
 and they weren't used publicly.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.160
 But this guy called Moritz von Jacoby,

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.960
 who was a Russian engineer.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.040
 So they've been around about the same time

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.640
 there was a boat that carried passengers

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:50.840
 that was electric powered.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.840
 And he built an electric car that he exhibited

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.600
 around Scotland and he just couldn't get people

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:56.440
 interested in it.

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:59.680
 So people like, I don't see any use to this.

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.120
 The only people who were interested were railway workers

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.840
 and they were afraid it was gonna supplant the railway.

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.700
 And so they smashed it up in his garage

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.220
 in the middle of the night and took 40 years

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:10.580
 before it took off again.

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:11.420
 - Wow.

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:12.740
 - Yeah, rough.

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:15.300
 - So much what might have been stuff about this.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:17.860
 It's obviously so nice to imagine, you know,

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:19.420
 all the cars were electric, working me off.

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:23.400
 - And then thanks to bloody cyclists such as myself

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.820
 who claim we're so environmentally friendly these days,

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:28.060
 but we killed the electric car

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:31.860
 because it was the improvement of road surfaces

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:34.940
 in the late 19th century by kind of cyclists

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:37.320
 pushing for improved road surfaces so they could go touring,

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.600
 which meant that people wanted to go on longer drives.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.440
 And the one problem with electric cars back then

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:42.520
 was the same as now,

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.440
 which is that they didn't have very big range.

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.320
 And so suddenly gasoline petrol cars took off

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.520
 'cause they could drive a long way

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.320
 over these newly surfaced roads.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.960
 So cyclists got a lot to answer for actually.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:56.800
 - But then when they did know

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:57.960
 that they couldn't go very far

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:01.240
 and so they aimed the electric cars directly at women.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:05.360
 So in the 1910s and going into the 1920s,

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.940
 you would get these advertisements

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:09.220
 like for the Argo company.

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:12.700
 They advertised their electric vehicle as a woman's car

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:14.600
 that any man is proud to drive.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:18.540
 And the idea was that women wouldn't want

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:19.620
 to go on long journeys.

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:22.580
 They would much rather kind of poodle around the city

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:23.420
 or whatever.

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:25.140
 And so we're more likely to buy these cars.

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:25.980
 - More poodle.

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:27.620
 - That's so, that's classic women.

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:29.460
 They hate distance.

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:30.300
 They hate the notion of distance.

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:33.900
 They take a brain to kind of absorb those big numbers.

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:36.580
 Did anyone else think when James said

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:38.900
 the only way to use electric cars was to aim them at women

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:39.940
 that you literally were saying

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:42.500
 you're pointing electric cars at women?

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:43.500
 Put your foot down.

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:45.580
 - That's another Easter egg on the Tesla.

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:48.160
 (upbeat music)

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:55.560
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Anna.

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:59.020
 - My fact this week is that from 1975 to 2004,

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:02.300
 it was illegal to buy the world's most popular

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.980
 collection of jazz music.

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:07.860
 And when I say jazz music, I mean sheet music.

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:09.860
 So jazz music that you play.

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:12.180
 So this is this thing called the real book.

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:15.740
 And I learned about it on a 99% invisible episode

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:18.820
 that I was pointed to by the browser.

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:20.260
 So I just want to point out if there's anyone left

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.060
 in the country who hasn't discovered the browser.com,

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:26.180
 it's an amazing site which curates great articles for you.

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:28.060
 - God, I've been signed up to the bowser.com

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:31.100
 which has the details of people called bowser.

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:31.940
 (laughing)

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:34.620
 It's not coming handy for 300 episodes.

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:36.580
 - So okay, they don't really want your type on there.

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:38.860
 It's sort of a highbrow thing.

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:43.300
 Anyway, thebrowser.com pointed me towards the real book

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:45.940
 which is the definitive book of jazz tunes

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:47.340
 for anyone who wants to play jazz.

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:49.700
 Anyone who is a jazz musician out there,

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:50.980
 I'm sure will know it.

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:56.060
 And this was made in 1974

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:59.180
 and it was published and sold

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:01.060
 without any kind of copyright releases

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:04.420
 or any permissions or any royalties arranged or anything.

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:06.740
 It was just written out, printed off

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:09.020
 and then sold in sort of back alleyways

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:12.140
 and in people's bedrooms, student bedrooms

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:13.940
 and every jazz student has to have it.

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:15.580
 And it's basically all the jazz standards

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:17.740
 as they're called from the beginning of jazz

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:20.900
 from the 1920s and even before that you need

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:23.180
 if you want to entertain someone in a bar.

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:25.380
 - It's amazing the story of how it came about as well.

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:28.780
 It's sort of originated with the fact that radio stations

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:31.740
 needed to work out how to pay copyrights and royalties

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:34.140
 towards the composers of certain songs

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:35.620
 and they had a really hard time doing it.

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:38.020
 So they created this thing called the tune decks

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.940
 and they were index cards that on one side

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.860
 had the information about a particular song.

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:45.020
 So it would have your composer's name

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:47.540
 or any of the information that you would need for payment.

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:48.740
 And on the other side,

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.820
 they would have literally the sheet music

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:52.540
 but like a section of the song

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:54.220
 so that anyone who was playing the song

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:56.100
 could identify it via the lyrics

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:59.180
 or by literally the notes on the staves.

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:00.340
 - And when you say playing, you mean like

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:02.660
 if you're a radio DJ, anyone who's putting the song on.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:03.980
 So it's like, you'll hear the song

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:05.420
 and then you can skim through these cards

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:07.060
 and be like, oh yeah, that looks like the tune.

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:08.940
 So I can say, this is Blah-dee-blah

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:10.820
 by so-and-so, probably.

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:12.700
 - Does that mean a DJ would have to be able

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:14.100
 to read music to even-

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:15.180
 - That's what it sounded like.

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:16.020
 - Yeah.

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:16.860
 - It does sound like that.

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:19.980
 And so one of the reasons that they became quite popular

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:23.300
 was because musicians found them really useful

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:24.860
 for when they were going to gigs

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:27.300
 to be able to use them basically as cheat sheets

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:28.740
 so that they could look at it

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:30.660
 and fake their way through a popular song

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:32.260
 that they didn't necessarily know.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.180
 And because it's jazz and free-flowing,

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:35.860
 you can venture off the main theme

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:37.220
 but it's the essence of it.

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:38.380
 - It gives you the basics

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:40.580
 and then from there, you can kind of fake it.

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:41.420
 - Yes.

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:44.420
 - It gives you the chords and the kind of melody

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:45.260
 and the lyrics.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.340
 And as Dan says, you just riff off the back of that

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:48.340
 which you do anyway.

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:49.180
 - Cool.

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:52.180
 - And then you said that it was legal in 2004

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:55.460
 and that's because a company made a legal version

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:57.220
 where they got all the copyrights from people

00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:58.660
 and stuff like that, right?

00:16:58.660 --> 00:16:59.500
 - Yes.

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.540
 And lots of other publishers tried to publish

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:02.660
 actual books of jazz tunes

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:06.220
 but this because it had evolved over 50, 60, 70 years,

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:07.060
 nothing could compete.

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:08.300
 So yeah, I think in the end,

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:10.100
 it was Hal Leonard music publishers, wasn't it?

00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:11.820
 Who got all the rights to all the songs

00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:13.020
 which must have been held.

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:13.860
 - Yeah.

00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:15.780
 I think the reason other publishers couldn't compete

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:17.500
 was that they were trying to do it legally.

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:19.820
 (laughing)

00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:20.900
 I asked a friend of mine,

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:23.540
 my friend Will who is a jazz saxophonist,

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:25.740
 I asked him, have you heard of the real book?

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:27.140
 And he said, of course I have.

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:28.300
 And he said, there are many editions

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:29.700
 and I own many editions.

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.940
 And I, he said that--

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:33.660
 - Illegal editions Andy or the legal ones.

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:35.460
 - I'm not saying, I'm not dropping him in there

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:37.780
 although I have an active on this podcast.

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:39.100
 - What is it called, Will?

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:39.940
 - Will, yeah.

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:40.780
 - All right, Will, yeah.

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:42.100
 - Will Gumbins, yeah, yeah.

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:44.380
 (laughing)

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:46.260
 But he said that until the sixth edition,

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.380
 they didn't have quite enough of the standards for it

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:50.580
 to be, you know, all encompassing comprehensive.

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:52.300
 So apparently you want the sick edition onwards

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:53.980
 if you're in the market.

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:56.660
 - It's kind of hard to,

00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:58.820
 'cause so many tunes in the whole point of jazz, I suppose,

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.460
 or lots of the point of it is that there's lots

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:01.300
 of improvisation.

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:03.900
 It's kind of hard to know in the real book

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.500
 which bits have come from who.

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.680
 So, you know, if someone's got a brilliant

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.580
 do-be-do, do-be-do moment.

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:10.420
 - Oh yeah.

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:11.980
 - And they play that on the night.

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:12.820
 Does that--

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:13.660
 - That's Miles Dovers, I think.

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:14.500
 Isn't it unmistakable?

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:15.660
 - Yeah, that's right, yeah.

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:18.180
 You know, as in who kind of owns that

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:19.860
 is a really vexed question.

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:22.900
 They had jazz diplomacy, of course.

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:27.420
 The idea being that America would send jazz musicians out

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:31.940
 to countries that were threatened by communism.

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:35.340
 And the jazz musicians would make people think

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:36.620
 that America's a great place

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:39.180
 'cause it has this kind of subversive music.

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:42.060
 And this was started by a congressman called

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:44.780
 Adam Clayton Powell Jr.,

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:46.700
 who was an African-American congressman

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:48.340
 who represented Harlem.

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:49.660
 But it wasn't really his idea.

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:50.820
 It was his wife's idea.

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:52.780
 His wife was called Hazel Scott

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:55.100
 and she was a jazz pianist.

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:56.020
 And she was amazing.

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:59.980
 She was the first black American to host her own TV show,

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:01.360
 the Hazel Scott Show.

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:03.140
 She would never play in a place

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:05.780
 where there was any segregation

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:06.780
 between black and white people.

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:09.260
 She would turn up and then if there was any segregation,

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.540
 she'd walk away and cause riots a lot of the time

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:12.940
 'cause she wouldn't play.

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:14.340
 But she was eventually brought down

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:16.700
 because people thought she was a communist.

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:18.860
 - But the interesting thing,

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:20.380
 or another interesting thing about her

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:23.900
 is that her grandson, Adam C. Powell IV,

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:26.540
 currently runs a company that's trying to find greener ways

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:29.300
 to find rare earth metals for electric cars.

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:32.900
 So we've come a full circle to the electric car stuff.

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:33.740
 - Very nice.

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.340
 - This is the Powell family podcast.

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:37.060
 (all laughing)

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:40.380
 - Well, there was a thing in the First World War called,

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:43.900
 this was, I guess, this was not jazz diplomacy.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:46.220
 In fact, it was the opposite, it was jazz war

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:49.420
 because there was a regiment called the Harlem Hellfighters.

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:50.480
 That was their nickname

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:53.460
 and they were the 369th US infantry,

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:55.340
 largely recruited from Harlem.

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:58.780
 And so, and it had a lot of musicians in it, the regiment.

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:00.940
 And as they arrived in France, they played jazz

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:02.820
 and people in France,

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:04.900
 maybe some people in Paris had had jazz before,

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:08.660
 but people in, you know, 1917 in rural France

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:09.900
 had not had jazz.

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:12.100
 And as they arrived, they played a jazz version

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:15.060
 of the Marseillais and it blew people's minds.

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:17.380
 And there was a kind of mini craze

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:19.380
 which got called ragtimeitis.

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:22.420
 As a result of it, people hadn't had syncopated rhythms

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.020
 before playing off the beat.

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:25.220
 This is insane.

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:28.020
 - In World War II, there was also a bit of jazz war

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:31.180
 waged by Britain who launched a jazz radio station

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:34.100
 in Germany, which I had never read about.

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.180
 But this was basically a surrogateous way

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:39.500
 to poison the minds of Germans against the Nazis.

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:41.660
 And it involves setting up a jazz station

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:44.780
 and the announcer on it was a woman called Agnes Bernel.

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:46.900
 She was actually a German expat.

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:49.900
 She'd fled Nazi Germany and landed in Britain.

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:53.220
 And they said, can you be a DJ on a fake jazz radio station?

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:55.700
 And through you, we'll get loads of secret messages out there

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:58.100
 to basically to plant chaos.

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:00.740
 For instance, she commiserated at one point

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:04.020
 with a specific German U-boat captain saying,

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:05.540
 you must be so hard for him

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:07.460
 'cause he hasn't been on leave for two years.

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:10.740
 But congratulations on the birth of his son at home.

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:12.860
 That's why I've just given birth to a son.

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:15.100
 And this guy got one.

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:16.940
 - So she was pregnant for over two years.

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:17.980
 That's amazing.

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:19.380
 - Very long gestation period.

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:21.540
 - I've just understood the implication.

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:24.020
 - Wow, I'm naive.

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:27.180
 - He was captaining a boat off the coast of Scotland

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:30.100
 and he went to the coast and surrendered and said,

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:32.100
 saw this, my wife just shagged someone else.

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:32.940
 I'm out.

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:34.540
 Surrendered that boat.

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:35.820
 So it worked.

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:38.500
 But there was another thing that she was reminiscing about

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:39.860
 on the show I listened to her on,

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:43.420
 which was that she announced on this radio station

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:46.340
 that Allied saboteurs in SS uniforms

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:48.220
 had been dropped in a particular region.

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:50.620
 And so SS cars went all over this region,

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:51.860
 arresting each other.

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:54.700
 Whenever they saw each other they arrested each other.

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:56.140
 - That's a great idea.

00:21:56.140 --> 00:22:00.020
 - Have you guys heard of Russ and Roland Kirk?

00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:01.700
 - No.

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:05.660
 - I think he might be my favorite jazz player ever.

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:07.420
 I only found him in the course of researching this,

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:11.500
 but he was blind from a very young age.

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:12.660
 And in spite of that,

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:14.140
 he not only mastered saxophone,

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:17.340
 he managed to master playing three saxophones

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:18.180
 at the same time.

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:20.160
 - Hang on.

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.980
 - Okay, how much orificence is he?

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:22.820
 - Incredible.

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:25.860
 - I could imagine blowing it three on that,

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:26.780
 or three on your mouth,

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:29.340
 but he's not blown through his ears or his anus, is he?

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:30.180
 - He wasn't.

00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:31.660
 No, he was not.

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:33.300
 He had three saxophones around his neck

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:35.700
 and he could fit all three into his mouth,

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:37.820
 stretched out at the same time.

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:39.140
 - Okay, for the listeners,

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:40.820
 Andy was stretching his mouth out there

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:44.300
 by putting his index fingers into the sides of his mouth

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:45.700
 and pulling them sideways.

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:48.340
 - Yeah.

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:49.820
 - That can't have been a good sound.

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:50.660
 Did it work?

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:51.700
 - It sounds all right.

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:52.540
 - Does it?

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:54.500
 - I mean, yeah, but he doesn't have enough hands.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:55.340
 - Yeah, I was going to say,

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:58.620
 it's not just mouths that you need to play saxophone.

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:01.020
 - Okay, this is where it gets interesting.

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:02.440
 He had six hands.

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:09.340
 He uses his two hands on two sets of keys

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:11.180
 and lets the third saxophone go for the moment,

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:13.660
 but he's always shifting hands between the saxes.

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:16.860
 It's better than I've made it sound.

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:18.980
 And he could also play the flute with his mouth

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:20.740
 while playing the recorder with his nose.

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:22.540
 That he was unbelievably talented.

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:25.620
 - That's very cool.

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:29.540
 I did a quick search into sort of other jazz books

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:31.460
 that are out there that we might not have heard of.

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:34.340
 And it led me to discover a book that was published

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:38.660
 by one of the great American jazz musicians, Charles Mingus,

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:41.380
 who I actually, I grew up listening to.

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:43.720
 He's an extraordinary musician.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:46.540
 And it turns out that after his gigs,

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:48.820
 he used to sell a self-published book.

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:52.300
 It was a sort of pamphlet, which he called a catalog,

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:54.480
 cat hyphen a log.

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:57.420
 And it was a book that was toilet training for your cat,

00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:58.660
 which he was obsessed by.

00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:02.620
 So he had a cat called Nightlife,

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:05.780
 who he claims he took three to four weeks to train,

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:07.820
 to sit on a toilet.

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:11.460
 And the whole pamphlet is his step-by-step guide

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:13.540
 for how you can make this happen.

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:15.700
 And so it starts with, you've got to teach them

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:18.340
 to go to a kitty litter to begin with,

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:21.740
 slowly inch that box towards the bathroom.

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:23.260
 Once you've reached the bathroom

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:24.660
 and they feel comfortable going there,

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:26.820
 put the box on top of the toilet,

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:29.300
 then cut a hole in the, this is over, you know,

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:33.460
 a period of wheat, cut a hole at the bottom of the cardboard,

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:35.420
 then gradually cut the box down.

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:37.660
 So it's just a flat bit of paper.

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:40.100
 And eventually you'll find, he said,

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:42.660
 "You'll be hearing in the night just flushing noises

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:45.300
 from the toilet as your cat has taken itself

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:46.140
 to the toilet."

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:48.620
 - Sorry, the cat flushes it after this.

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:51.060
 - This is, Nightlife apparently does this.

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:53.500
 - So is this Charlie Mingus' cat?

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:54.820
 Charles Mingus' cat?

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:57.580
 Charles Mingus, as well as sustaining

00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:59.100
 the incredible jazz career he did,

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:00.180
 was house training a cat.

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:01.700
 It's, I can't believe that.

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:02.540
 - I know, it's extraordinary.

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:04.980
 And honestly, after gigs, this is what he would sell.

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:06.100
 This was like his big push.

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:09.660
 He printed ads up where he was doing mail order

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:11.180
 so that you could buy these pamphlets.

00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:13.180
 - So there is another jazz book, which is so weird,

00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:14.940
 called A Cat O'Logue,

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:16.580
 which this might have been in response to

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:17.980
 'cause it was by Cab Calloway.

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:20.860
 In 1938, he published Cab Calloway's Cat O'Logue,

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:22.260
 A Hepster's Dictionary,

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:25.340
 which was the first dictionary written

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:28.140
 by an African-American and it was the Jive Language

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:29.900
 reference book of the New York Public Library.

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:31.260
 So if you went to the library and you wanted to know

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:33.860
 about Jive Talk, this is the book you'd get.

00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:37.860
 - And the cat there is like a hep cat, I guess, right?

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:38.940
 - Exactly, yeah.

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:42.500
 So is it possible Charlie Mingus was referring

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:43.340
 nodding to that?

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:47.940
 - In my reading, I didn't see any of that as a pun reference.

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:50.020
 - Awful if you mistakenly got the wrong one.

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:51.540
 You'll never train that cat,

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:53.780
 but it will speak very good Jive.

00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:56.180
 So this back was about the black market.

00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:58.500
 So selling music on the black market.

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:01.060
 So I had to look at some of the black market stuff.

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:03.420
 What do you reckon is the most expensive

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:06.020
 of your bodily organs on the black market?

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:10.260
 - Eyeballs.

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:14.660
 - Oh, corneas, $30,000 on the black market about.

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:16.820
 This is according to the website Ranker,

00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:18.340
 which has got quite a few.

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:20.660
 It does have quite a lot of good sources in this list.

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:22.460
 So I can't, I'll say,

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:26.300
 a kidney.

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:27.820
 - Oh, got it in one, Andy.

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:28.660
 I can't believe it.

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:29.500
 Yeah, kidney.

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:32.780
 So apparently if you wanna buy a kidney on the black market,

00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:35.860
 it's gonna cost you approximately $200,000.

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:38.820
 And they sourced for that a book called

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:40.780
 Cultural Anthropology by William Haveland,

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:41.900
 which came out in 2010.

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:44.620
 So it might be quite a bit more than that now.

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:47.500
 But compared to $200,000 for your kidneys,

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:49.660
 about $157,000 for your liver.

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:50.860
 That's what you said, Anna, wasn't it?

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:54.900
 So probably second, your heart,

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:56.860
 apparently an illegally obtained heart

00:26:56.860 --> 00:27:00.660
 is only worth about $119,000.

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:02.540
 And I think the reason for that is,

00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:07.540
 you need to have such a specialist to put your heart in.

00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:11.020
 Really, if you're in a situation where you need a new heart,

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:13.900
 you're probably in a legit hospital.

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:16.100
 So there's not many people on the street corner going,

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:17.900
 "Anyone got a heart?"

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:18.740
 - Oh, it's kidneys.

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:20.140
 You can just ram it in, can't you?

00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:22.180
 - Stop it, I'll put it on, hope for the best.

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:24.020
 (laughing)

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:25.220
 That's one way, yeah.

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:26.340
 - When you say street corners,

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:29.300
 is that like, I feel like it's more,

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:30.860
 that's more high-end selling, right?

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:33.060
 Because I imagine I've got a kidney

00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:36.820
 or I've got a bootleg copy of, you know, grown-ups too.

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:41.140
 You know, those are the things I'd expect on a street corner.

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:43.580
 - I don't think it's just, it's probably, it is.

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:45.300
 I mean, apart from anything else,

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:46.500
 if you're giving someone a kidney,

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:48.220
 it has to be kept in a very sterile,

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:49.460
 very cold environment.

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:53.260
 It can't be, you can't open up your coat

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:54.460
 and on the inside lining,

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:56.740
 it's just got a load of organs just hanging off it.

00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:58.100
 That's not gonna work out.

00:27:58.100 --> 00:27:59.820
 (laughing)

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:01.660
 - Thanks for a lovely coat, though.

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:02.500
 - Yeah.

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:04.020
 - Sounds like something Lady Gargoyle would wear.

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:04.860
 - Yes.

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:07.440
 (upbeat music)

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:12.740
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:14.460
 and that is James.

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:16.940
 - Okay, my fact this week is that the world's longest

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:20.380
 water slide is almost 20 times longer

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:22.300
 than the world's shortest river.

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:24.900
 - Insane.

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:25.740
 - Great.

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:27.140
 - Which one is more surprising?

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:28.060
 What, what are the lengths?

00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:29.580
 And I'll decide which one I'm more surprised by.

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:31.460
 The shortness of the river or the length of the water slide?

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:33.700
 - Okay, well, the river,

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:35.020
 which we might get onto a bit later

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:36.300
 'cause it's a bit controversial,

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:41.100
 the river is 201 feet or 61 meters long

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:46.980
 and the water slide is 1,111 meters.

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:52.740
 So that's over a kilometer long, 3,645 feet.

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:54.380
 - So cool.

00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:55.220
 - It's amazing.

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:58.500
 - I think the water slide is a more stunning one

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.540
 to go over a kilometer in a water slide.

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:04.700
 And this is in Penang, which is in Malaysia,

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:06.420
 in northern Malaysia.

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:08.100
 And it was recently featured

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:10.940
 on the Guinness World Records YouTube channel

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:12.660
 where they showed a video of someone

00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:16.260
 going all the way down this water slide.

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:18.180
 And like I say, it's four minutes long.

00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:19.820
 And to get to this water slide,

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:22.940
 you have to go on a cable car chairlift.

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:24.860
 You can't just walk up the stairs or anything

00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:26.780
 like you would in a normal water park.

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:29.460
 It's one of those where you're in like a little rubber ring

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:31.460
 and you go down there.

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:32.900
 - The best kind.

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:33.740
 - Yeah.

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:35.340
 - Relaxing, but also thrilling, I think, yeah.

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:36.900
 - Oh, that's kind of controversial statement.

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:39.100
 - No, because it is better

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:44.100
 because the water doesn't jet up you in the same way.

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:47.740
 - Some people like that, I must say.

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:48.680
 - Yeah, okay, yeah.

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:49.960
 - Tickles like kidneys.

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:56.380
 But yeah, some people just like the simplicity

00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:58.780
 of just sitting down and you're swimming cosy

00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:00.580
 and going straight down on your bum.

00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:01.420
 - It's very true.

00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:02.260
 - It's very true.

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:03.080
 - You've got no protection.

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:05.740
 The ring takes away some of the risk factor.

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:06.940
 - And that's what I like about it.

00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:07.780
 - Yep.

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:08.620
 (all laughing)

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:11.380
 - I think also a ring like sometimes it makes you go

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:13.860
 further off the edge and makes it feel a bit scarier

00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:14.700
 if you're going fast.

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:16.100
 - It is scarier, I agree.

00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:18.060
 If you take a corner too hard,

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:20.620
 you risk flying out of the whole thing.

00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:22.540
 That's happened to me a couple of times.

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:23.380
 - Really?

00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:25.140
 - Yeah, and it's petrifying.

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:25.980
 - You've come out.

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:29.540
 - Well, I sort of went a bit over the lip on a corner

00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:31.980
 and that really scared me to never really push it

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:33.420
 on a water slide ever again.

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:35.820
 What's amazing though about this water slide is that--

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:36.940
 - I'm just imagining how lame

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:38.500
 you all are at a water park.

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:39.340
 (all laughing)

00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:40.160
 - What?

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:41.460
 - I'm going, I had a terrifying experience

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:42.860
 when I went quite far up the wall

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:44.700
 and you're going, oh, I'd rather do this sort of

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:48.340
 in a car so that I'm not touching any cars or anything.

00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:49.180
 (all laughing)

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:52.260
 - I always keep my hands on the side to slow me down.

00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:54.420
 And then I have to push myself along

00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:56.380
 'cause the water's not pushing me.

00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:57.220
 - Yeah.

00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:58.060
 (all laughing)

00:30:58.060 --> 00:30:59.740
 - It's a shinski behind me, probably.

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:01.540
 I'm doing a bomb shape.

00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:03.180
 (all laughing)

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:04.620
 - Bloody rocket on the back of it.

00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:07.140
 (all laughing)

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:09.860
 - But this visually, this is an amazing water slide.

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:11.380
 Like the first thing to say about it

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:13.140
 is it's a physical water slide.

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:15.900
 So the previous sort of, the previous record

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:19.140
 for the longest water slide was in Vernon, New Jersey.

00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:21.180
 And that was an inflatable water slide,

00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:23.860
 which is what I immediately pictured

00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:25.220
 when you sent this fact, James.

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:28.900
 But this goes through this beautiful dense forest

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:30.900
 and it's open-top and you're just, you know,

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:33.180
 you're going through trees and it's absolutely--

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:34.020
 - Oh, wow.

00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:36.580
 - It's basically, if you flip out of that, Dan,

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:39.300
 you're living with the squirrels for quite a few years

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:40.980
 before they find you again, thank you.

00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:42.740
 (all laughing)

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:44.460
 - That's how Tarzan starts, isn't it?

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:46.860
 (all laughing)

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:48.100
 So is it a straight line?

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:49.460
 It's not winding around around a hundred inches.

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:50.900
 - No, very much winding, yeah.

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:53.660
 You end up quite close to where you began.

00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:54.500
 - Good to know.

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:56.340
 - And it has leisurely bits in it as well,

00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:58.580
 where it sort of goes on a bit more of a flat

00:31:58.580 --> 00:31:59.420
 and you just, you know,

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:02.140
 you just go along quite nicely pushed by the stream.

00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:04.380
 Now that sounds interesting to me.

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:05.220
 - That's Andy's comment.

00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:06.060
 (all laughing)

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:07.980
 - Andy's reading Pride and Prejudice on the way down

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:09.300
 is waterproof copy.

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:11.340
 (all laughing)

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:14.540
 - Yeah, I've never really sort of looked into

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:16.380
 or thought about water slides at all before,

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:17.500
 but they're amazing.

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:21.660
 They, you know, I really like the pioneer of water sliding,

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:22.700
 Dick Krull.

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:25.140
 - One of them.

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:26.460
 - Oh, his sound fun.

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:27.980
 Like, oh, and Dick Krull's water slide.

00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:30.300
 - It sounds like an original name for Dick Dastardly,

00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:31.140
 doesn't it?

00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:32.740
 - Yeah.

00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:35.380
 - He dug a five acre lake,

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:38.580
 which he was going to be using for bass fishing.

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:41.620
 Bass the fish, obviously.

00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:43.500
 (all laughing)

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:45.140
 - Not the make of better.

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:45.980
 - I'm sorry, yeah.

00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:48.340
 (all laughing)

00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:49.860
 - And then he had all this dirt

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:52.420
 and he shaped the dirt into this massive great ramp,

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:55.220
 350 feet long, which was a waterfall.

00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:56.260
 And then he realized it could be

00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:57.860
 a recreational water slide.

00:32:57.860 --> 00:32:59.940
 And that was supposedly the world's first,

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:01.460
 but actually I think there was some.

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:02.300
 - When was that?

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:04.540
 - That was '71.

00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:06.100
 - '71, okay, yeah.

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:09.540
 - Oh, 'cause there was another guy who dug his own lake

00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:12.220
 with similar results called Bob Byers.

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:13.940
 And he created Lake Dolores.

00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:15.620
 He called it, it was named after his wife.

00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:17.780
 And this was a water park, a recreational water park

00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:20.140
 that he created just for his family.

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:22.980
 This was in the late fifties that he did this.

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:25.460
 So he made this lake in a series of pools and channels

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:27.780
 and people would drive past it and noticed it

00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:28.820
 and rocked up and would be like,

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:31.460
 "Hey, can I have a go in this fun recreational lake

00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:32.300
 "you've created?"

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:36.380
 And so then, yeah, he added eight 150 foot slides.

00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:39.700
 And he also added, which doesn't seem to exist anymore,

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:41.780
 two standing slides.

00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:43.540
 And they're really cool photos of doing this.

00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:45.540
 So they're kind of in a V shape.

00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:47.420
 So you stand up and your feet are just squashed

00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:49.220
 into the little bottom of the V.

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:50.620
 And you shoot down very fast.

00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:52.660
 I think they go at like a 60 degree slope.

00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:54.380
 So really steep.

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:57.060
 And you're on a little, it looks like you're on a little,

00:33:57.060 --> 00:33:58.500
 you know, those floats you'd have in a pool

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:01.180
 before you could swim, like standing on one of those.

00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:02.700
 - What do you mean before?

00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:05.180
 I don't know if you can swim or not.

00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:07.020
 - Yeah, they are.

00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:09.380
 - Of course, your mum makes you bring them

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:11.700
 into the office every day in case it rains.

00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:14.900
 Yeah, it sounds amazing.

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:17.500
 And then it's shut down.

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:20.100
 - Did you see the sort of like original,

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:21.980
 original water slides?

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:24.100
 The ones that didn't have water on them?

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:24.940
 Have you spotted those ones?

00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:26.540
 - Like just slides, are they?

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:27.740
 - Yeah, there were slides,

00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:28.900
 but you ended up in the water.

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:30.420
 So they got the ending right,

00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:32.340
 but they didn't get the initial bit.

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:34.620
 Well, actually, you didn't even really end up in the water.

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:36.980
 Basically what it was is in New Zealand

00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:39.620
 as part of the 1906 International Exhibition,

00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:40.860
 they had this wonderland.

00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:44.300
 And they created these slides where you went down in boats.

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:48.740
 And once you got to the bottom, you traveled, you know,

00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:51.740
 you were basically skimming across the water in a boat

00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:53.020
 as you got to the bottom.

00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:57.020
 And that got developed later in 1923 to Herbert Selner,

00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:59.500
 who lived in America, who created it,

00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:01.020
 but with a sort of sled.

00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:02.700
 So when you went down on the sled,

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:04.460
 you would eventually topple into the water,

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:06.820
 but it got you about a hundred feet

00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:10.100
 of skimming across the water once you'd reached the bottom.

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:12.700
 And those were the kind of precursors before they realized,

00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:14.700
 oh, let's just put water in and lose the sled.

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:16.580
 - They're very cool.

00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:18.940
 - I think, yeah, they are cool.

00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:20.780
 There was one of those in Coney Island as well.

00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:23.060
 We talked about Coney Island the other week

00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:26.380
 as one that was in Coney Island in 1895.

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:29.460
 But this one in the International Exhibition in 1906,

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:32.620
 it went into Lake Victoria in Christchurch,

00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:34.300
 was the place it ended up.

00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:37.300
 And it was, this exhibition was so popular

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:42.300
 that 1,967,682 people visited it

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:45.180
 at a time when the whole population of New Zealand

00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:48.020
 was 975,000.

00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:51.660
 So more than twice as many people went to this

00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:53.860
 as lived in the whole country.

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:55.700
 And then this slide got bought out

00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:57.660
 and got taken to Wellington.

00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:59.060
 And they had it there for a few years

00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:00.740
 and eventually it got taken down.

00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:02.940
 But the position where it was in Wellington

00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:05.540
 is where Peter Jackson's studio is at today.

00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:07.860
 - Really? - Yeah.

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:10.940
 - So it's seen a lot over the years that place.

00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:12.900
 Was that the one which this guy called Arthur Guinness

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:13.740
 went down?

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:15.540
 I think there was a newspaper report from 1906

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:17.340
 and he was the Speaker of the House of Representatives

00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:18.180
 at the time.

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:20.380
 And the only reason it's funny is if you Google

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:22.580
 Arthur Guinness, the Speaker of the House of Representatives

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:24.300
 of New Zealand in 1906.

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:27.740
 And he's got a huge white wig on.

00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:29.540
 I'm not sure that he wore this

00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:31.060
 when he was going down the slide.

00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:33.180
 But his white wig was one of those really elaborate

00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:35.700
 waxed mustaches, huge beard.

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:37.740
 And the newspaper report said he turned up

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:39.940
 and the next thing all spectators knew was

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:42.500
 there was a tall black hat among a lot of girls

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:44.420
 being hauled up in the carriage.

00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:46.820
 And then as it shot down the slope,

00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:49.060
 he had his silk hat pulled over his ears

00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:52.180
 and a hard point of order look in his eye.

00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:53.700
 Which I'm not sure how that goes,

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:55.980
 but as they splashed into the water, somebody shouted,

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:57.540
 "Point of order!"

00:36:57.540 --> 00:36:58.660
 - Classic. - Funny joke.

00:36:58.660 --> 00:36:59.620
 - Great. - Yeah.

00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:02.220
 - Classic satire. - Yeah.

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:02.980
 - That's really good.

00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:05.380
 - The very start of this section, dear listener,

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:08.060
 you might remember, was that the longest water slide

00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:10.300
 is 20 times longer than the world's shortest river.

00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:13.380
 So I should quickly tell you about the world's shortest river.

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:16.060
 And that is the Roe River.

00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:19.260
 But it's extremely controversial.

00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:22.580
 - Has it said a few out-of-date things?

00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:26.020
 - Has it been cancelled? - It's been cancelled.

00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:28.260
 This was something I read in an article

00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:30.820
 on the website "Conday Nest"

00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:34.540
 and it was written by Jeopardy Champion in America, Ken Jennings.

00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:37.580
 And it was basically the argument between two rivers

00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:40.180
 in America, the Roe River and the D River,

00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:42.140
 about which was the shortest.

00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:43.980
 So the Guinness Book of Records had always said

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:46.060
 that the D River was the shortest.

00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:48.500
 But then one day in 1987,

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:51.780
 there was a teacher called Mrs. Susie Nardlinger.

00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:54.500
 And she got her fifth grade class to measure

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:57.780
 this little kind of water near their school

00:37:57.780 --> 00:37:59.780
 and work out how long it was.

00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:01.140
 And they realized that it was shorter

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:04.580
 than this so-called world's shortest river.

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:05.500
 But it didn't have a name,

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:07.420
 so it couldn't be in the Guinness Book of Records.

00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:10.580
 And so they wrote to the US Board on geographical names

00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:13.780
 and they got them to give it a name, which was the Roe River.

00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:15.180
 And then the Guinness Book of Records

00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:17.460
 put that as the world's shortest river.

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:21.500
 Now, the people who lived near the D River were furious

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:23.020
 because they'd lost their records

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:25.940
 to these bloody school kids, okay?

00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:27.580
 And this was in Lincoln City.

00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:30.940
 And there was the Chamber of Commerce in Lincoln City

00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:33.820
 said that this Roe River was nothing more

00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:37.540
 than a drainage ditch surveyed for a school project.

00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:42.180
 - One man's drainage ditch is another man's noble river.

00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:43.020
 So-

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:45.100
 - I think that's one way of looking at it.

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:47.580
 Mrs. Nardlinger, when she was told this,

00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:50.140
 said that the D River was nothing more

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:52.660
 than an ocean water backup.

00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:54.300
 And so there was this massive argument

00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:56.660
 between these two people about which was the shortest

00:38:56.660 --> 00:38:58.420
 and whether they were even real rivers

00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:00.900
 or they were just effluent pipes

00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:03.900
 or bits of the ocean coming in or whatever.

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:05.900
 And eventually Guinness just said,

00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:08.700
 you know what, let's not do this record anymore.

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:11.420
 And so they just, if you get a Guinness Book of Records now,

00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:12.820
 it's not in there anymore.

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:16.100
 - So cowardly, if they'd just stuck to their guns.

00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:19.060
 I mean, it was also a crazy record to have, isn't it?

00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:21.020
 Because they're both sides are saying to each other,

00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:23.340
 oh, yours is rubbish and tiny.

00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:25.580
 And yeah, that's kind of the point.

00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:27.860
 - Yes, we're not tiny enough.

00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:29.420
 - Yeah. - Exactly.

00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:31.420
 - I think I found a water slide actually

00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:33.380
 that would suit both you, Andy and you, Anna.

00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:36.020
 It's got the danger and the leisure at the same time.

00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:38.700
 And this is in the Bahamas.

00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:39.780
 And so what it is is you,

00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:42.820
 it's called the Serpent Water Slide at the Atlantis Resort.

00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:46.580
 And you go down and it's a normal water slide,

00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:49.660
 but then Andy, you come out into a sort of,

00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:51.980
 what takes about two minutes to get across,

00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:54.940
 leisurely bit where you're just in your rubber ring

00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:58.020
 and you're going very nicely to the end.

00:39:58.020 --> 00:39:59.580
 Where the danger bit comes in

00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:03.060
 is when you're having that leisurely bit in the slide,

00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:06.300
 you are in the middle of a giant aquarium

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:08.340
 with sharks on either side of you.

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:09.820
 - Yeah, it looks amazing.

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:11.460
 My friend's been on that one actually,

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:13.980
 weirdly got a tutoring job with a family.

00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:15.220
 And then after tutoring them,

00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:17.820
 this was years ago, I realized they were incredibly rich

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:20.260
 and got taken for two weeks in the Bahamas with them

00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:22.580
 and said it was so fantastic.

00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:23.420
 - That's so funny.

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:24.580
 I thought you were going to say

00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:26.820
 that they were tutoring in the Bahamas

00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:28.260
 and they were so incredibly rich,

00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:29.820
 they took them to a water park.

00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:36.220
 - I mean, we can only dream one day

00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:38.860
 we'll be able to afford a thought park.

00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:40.620
 - Right at the very top of this fact, Dan,

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:42.620
 you said that the previous record holder

00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:45.380
 of the longest slide was in New Jersey.

00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:48.180
 It was in a place called Action Park.

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:50.820
 And Action Park is more famous on the internet

00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:53.660
 for having this incredible water slide

00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:55.980
 which had a loop-the-loop at the bottom,

00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:59.220
 which was only open for one month in 1985.

00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:01.140
 - Mad.

00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:02.260
 - It is incredible.

00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:04.020
 Basically what happens is you go down,

00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:06.460
 you get enough speed and you fly around the loop-the-loop

00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:08.180
 and you've got enough speed that you can stay

00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:09.620
 on the edge of the loop-the-loop

00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:11.020
 and then you come out at the end.

00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:13.060
 The centrifugal force sort of holds you

00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:15.180
 to the edge of the loop-the-loop.

00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:16.740
 But the problem is if you're like Andy

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:18.340
 and you kind of, or me I should say,

00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:19.260
 'cause I said this earlier,

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:20.620
 you kind of put your hands on it

00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:22.580
 to slow yourself down, right?

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:24.940
 If you did that, you don't have enough speed

00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:26.660
 to get around the loop-the-loop.

00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:28.420
 And so one thing that can happen

00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:30.620
 is if you get halfway and you run out of speed,

00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:32.300
 you just smack your head down

00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:34.380
 because gravity takes over.

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:36.500
 Another thing is you could get halfway up

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:38.860
 and then come right the way back down again

00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:40.220
 to the very, very bottom.

00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:42.820
 And then there's no way out of the slide

00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:45.140
 because you literally can't get out.

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:45.980
 And so they had-

00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:48.300
 - Netashinsky's coming up right behind you.

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:49.340
 - Well, you've got to send people.

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:52.140
 You've got to send people down to shove you along.

00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:54.380
 - Well, eventually instead of that solution,

00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:56.740
 they built a hatch at the bottom to let people out

00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:57.580
 if they got stuck.

00:41:57.580 --> 00:41:59.820
 - So that's, I've been on one that has the same thing.

00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:02.140
 There's my favorite water slide I've ever been on

00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:03.140
 is in the Gold Coast.

00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:04.500
 And if you do live in Australia

00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:06.100
 and you haven't been to it, you've got to.

00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:07.300
 And it's basically that.

00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:08.140
 It's incredible.

00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:10.060
 I think it's a place called Wet and Wild.

00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:12.500
 And you stand up really high at the top.

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:13.780
 So you start super high.

00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:15.500
 You're standing on a trap door.

00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:17.260
 And then, you know, they do a lot of,

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:18.300
 oh, you're ready?

00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:19.940
 Oh, are we going to go yet?

00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:22.220
 And then the trap door suddenly vanishes.

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:23.500
 And so you plummet down.

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:25.700
 So you drop vertically really fast for ages.

00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:27.740
 And then you do the loop, the loop,

00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:29.620
 which is so awesome.

00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:31.180
 So a woman did get stuck in it.

00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:32.860
 'Cause I remember seeing when I was going to go on it,

00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:35.420
 I saw this escape hatch in this loop.

00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:37.260
 And I was like, I wonder if that's ever been used.

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:39.380
 And there was indeed a woman who got stuck in it

00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:40.420
 a few years ago.

00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:42.060
 So you operate the hatch from inside

00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:43.900
 or do they have to have someone?

00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:44.740
 You do.

00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:46.900
 So she said, she realized she was stuck.

00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:48.300
 And she thought, my God,

00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:49.580
 it's someone going to come down after me.

00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:51.980
 I better clutch at this escape hatch with my hand

00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:53.780
 and pull yourself out.

00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:56.220
 Well, the one in New Jersey, anyway,

00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:58.140
 there was an interview on deadspin.com

00:42:58.140 --> 00:42:59.860
 with one of the people who worked there.

00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:01.740
 And they said that the main problem was

00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:03.740
 that at the very bottom of the loop, the loop,

00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:06.180
 a load of kind of sand and dirt and stuff

00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:07.380
 would kind of accumulate.

00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:08.820
 And they won't be able to get rid of it.

00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:10.060
 And so as you went down,

00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:11.420
 as soon as you got to the bottom of the loop,

00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:14.420
 the loop, it would just drag against your back

00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:16.940
 and just basically take all the skin off the bottom

00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:19.420
 of your back before you came out.

00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:21.340
 So that's why it's not there anymore.

00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:22.180
 Jesus.

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:25.260
 They are painful.

00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:26.500
 It's worth it because they're great,

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:28.300
 but almost all good water slides,

00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:31.060
 you end up with some serious, crazy things, don't you?

00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:32.220
 Not that painful.

00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:34.980
 Not to the end without your back.

00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:37.560
 (upbeat music)

00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:43.660
 Okay, it is time for fact number four.

00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:44.940
 And that is my fact.

00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:48.700
 My fact this week is that scientists in the South Pole

00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:51.620
 are starting to speak with an Antarctic accent.

00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:57.500
 This is an interesting thing that was studied

00:43:57.500 --> 00:44:00.540
 by the University of Munich.

00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:03.780
 And the idea was they wanted to see what effect

00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:06.860
 being isolated in a place like Antarctica

00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:09.660
 would have on a communal accent.

00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:13.340
 And the scientists at this university decided

00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:14.900
 that they were gonna do a case study

00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:17.740
 where they took 11 members of the bases there.

00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:19.500
 And they got them to sit down

00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:22.260
 and say 28 different words into a recorder

00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:23.860
 before their departure.

00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:25.220
 And these-- - Into a recorder.

00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:27.140
 Is this the same recorder that was up that nose?

00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:30.180
 (all laughing)

00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:32.180
 - Yeah, sorry, they were recording their voices.

00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:34.660
 Yeah, there was eight Brits, it was one American,

00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:37.340
 it was a German and someone from Iceland.

00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:40.300
 And then every six weeks for their entire stay,

00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:43.260
 they would get them to do a further recording

00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:45.140
 of the same 28 words.

00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:47.420
 And they noticed as they were going along

00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:50.300
 that their accents were all converging

00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:52.380
 towards the same vowel sounds.

00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:55.700
 For example, if they came in saying food,

00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:58.180
 they all started saying food.

00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:00.060
 Now, that doesn't sound too different.

00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:03.420
 It's very tiny, but what it is is the back of the throat

00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:06.660
 is being used for the first food that I'm saying there, food.

00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:09.420
 And then food is the front of my mouth using it.

00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:13.060
 And they all merged to this one same vowel sound.

00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:15.580
 Now, it's a very small study and there's a great video,

00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:16.900
 by the way, to watch about it

00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:19.500
 on the Hafer's Interesting website on YouTube.

00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:21.980
 Do check it out, it's a real proper explanation of it.

00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:23.700
 And they show you all the sounds.

00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:26.140
 But they noticed that an Antarctic accent

00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:28.020
 was emerging as a result.

00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:28.860
 - That's very cool.

00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:31.060
 - But such a shame that they didn't do what I definitely

00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:32.700
 would have done and said,

00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:34.460
 should we just really screw with these guys

00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:37.540
 and turn up six weeks later going food.

00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:39.780
 And I just, wow.

00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:42.260
 - Is it very cool or is it very cool?

00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:43.100
 Or is it very cool?

00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:44.620
 (laughing)

00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:46.340
 - Cue.

00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:48.140
 Yes, vowel fronting.

00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:50.620
 That does seem to be what happens to the sounds

00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:52.460
 that we make over time.

00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:54.580
 And there's this thing called goose fronting.

00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:56.380
 Did you guys, have you read about this?

00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:57.220
 - I know.

00:45:57.220 --> 00:45:58.700
 - It's this really cool linguistic thing

00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:01.380
 that was defined in 1983.

00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:06.020
 And it basically uses goose as the example word.

00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:07.540
 So exactly as Dan says,

00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:11.980
 we tend to start with words that have our tongue high up

00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:14.100
 and closer to the back of our mouth.

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:15.740
 And it makes a more rounded sound.

00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:18.420
 And over time, the tongue comes forward

00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:20.140
 and it makes a slightly more,

00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:21.780
 sort of sounds a bit more nasal sound.

00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:26.460
 So goose used to be said in a more sonorous rounded way.

00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:28.140
 And it's increasingly being said,

00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:31.780
 like goose, goose, goose.

00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:33.900
 In some places it's almost indistinguishable

00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:35.580
 from geese apparently.

00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:36.420
 - Geese.

00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:37.620
 - And then we don't know why this is happening.

00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:39.660
 It's happening all around the world, goose fronting.

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:43.660
 - Apparently, especially in southern British English, I read.

00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:44.500
 - Yes.

00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:47.140
 - I never noticed that you guys said the word goose

00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:48.860
 different than the way I say the word goose.

00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:49.700
 - Geese.

00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:53.060
 - But goose, how often have you heard us say goose though?

00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:54.900
 It's rare for me to say goose.

00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:57.900
 - I can imagine the queen would say goose, goose.

00:46:57.900 --> 00:46:58.740
 - Geese.

00:46:58.740 --> 00:46:59.580
 - Geese.

00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:00.420
 - Geese.

00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:01.260
 - Goose.

00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:02.100
 - Geese.

00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:03.980
 - Get that goose off my swab.

00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:06.740
 (laughing)

00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:08.660
 - There was another aspect of this Antarctic study,

00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:11.540
 which is, I mean, this is again in the runs of theory now,

00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:15.980
 but it was a theory that people might develop accents faster

00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:19.900
 if survival is more uncertain or more at risk.

00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:23.020
 So it helps if you can understand

00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:25.860
 what people are saying bluntly.

00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:28.300
 And it might accelerate the process

00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:29.820
 if there is more life and death situations.

00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:30.660
 - Really?

00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:31.500
 - Allegedly.

00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:32.980
 - I mean, over a long period of time though,

00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:36.020
 it's not like if you get stuck in a, you know, water slide,

00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:37.700
 you're not going to suddenly start talking

00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:40.260
 with a Geordie accent or something, it's like.

00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:42.420
 - We want to help, but we can't understand you anymore.

00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:43.620
 You've been in there so long.

00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:46.940
 - If you're in, if I went to a water park in Newcastle

00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:50.900
 and I was stuck in there, I might, in my panic, try.

00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:54.220
 - So I think that might make it much less likely

00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:55.660
 that you're rescued, don't you?

00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:57.580
 (laughing)

00:47:57.580 --> 00:48:00.340
 Or can you like, add that deck, let me out of here,

00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:01.180
 let me get me.

00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:04.660
 - Who's this dickhead?

00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:05.500
 Leave him in there.

00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:07.860
 (laughing)

00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:08.700
 That is cool.

00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:10.500
 So the idea is that these scientists in the Antarctic,

00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:12.740
 if one of them wakes up and is unintelligible to the others,

00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:14.900
 then they won't be able to survive.

00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:15.740
 So they will-

00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:16.580
 - We've run out of food.

00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:17.420
 What's he saying?

00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:19.380
 Food, we've run out of food.

00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:22.260
 Don't get it, mate, we've run out of what?

00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:24.300
 - And there was this, one of these linguists

00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:27.100
 was Jonathan Harrington from the University of Munich.

00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:28.540
 And he said specifically,

00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:31.900
 it might be if people go to Mars, for instance,

00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:34.100
 and you have a group of people who have all gone to Mars,

00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:35.700
 that by the time they come back

00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:36.900
 or that we can talk to them,

00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:39.260
 they might all have a different Mars accent.

00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:41.420
 - So cool, such a cool idea.

00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:42.900
 - Yeah, that's completely useless.

00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:44.060
 Imagine if they go to Mars,

00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:46.220
 gather all this vital scientific data,

00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:47.780
 bring it back and we've got no idea

00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:49.100
 what they're trying to tell us.

00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:51.860
 (laughing)

00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:54.900
 - There is a thing where you,

00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:57.460
 basically the longer that the queen is around,

00:48:57.460 --> 00:48:59.420
 the more you speak like the queen.

00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:02.460
 If you are a naked mole rat,

00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:08.380
 is a recent study where they looked at colonies

00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:11.460
 of naked mole rats and naked mole rats, they're mammals,

00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:13.820
 but they act a bit like bees and ants and stuff.

00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:16.340
 And they have a queen who's in charge of all the mating

00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:18.600
 and then all the workers and stuff like that.

00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:21.220
 But they found that the dialects

00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:22.680
 of all these naked mole rats,

00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:24.260
 all the little chirps and stuff they make

00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:26.540
 are very similar to what the queen makes.

00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:28.780
 And then as soon as the queen dies,

00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:30.500
 everyone sort of goes crazy

00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:33.220
 and does all sorts of weird accents and stuff like that.

00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:34.860
 And then when they get a new queen,

00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:36.700
 they all sort of go back towards

00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:40.340
 whatever that new queen's accent is like.

00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:41.180
 Isn't that cool?

00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:44.220
 So we'd all be kind of like walking around to London going,

00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:45.060
 how do you do?

00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:45.900
 How do you do?

00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:46.740
 How do you do?

00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:48.580
 And then as soon as, you know,

00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:50.820
 hopefully very long in the future, the queen dies,

00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:54.100
 then I'll be going, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:54.940
 - It's falling.

00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:56.780
 - Hunts and trees, oh, that, yes.

00:49:56.780 --> 00:50:00.140
 Monstrous carbuncle, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:01.740
 - Well, if you were a naked mole rat then,

00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:03.500
 then that would be the perfect moment

00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:08.140
 to infiltrate the pack of another group of naked mole rats

00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:11.580
 because accents are incredibly important to them

00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:14.080
 to the point where if you have a different accent,

00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:16.580
 let's say you've got 300 members

00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:18.380
 of a single colony of mole rats,

00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:20.180
 naked mole rats living with each other.

00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:23.620
 And a random mole rat from a different colony

00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:25.060
 comes in and wants to hang out.

00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:27.060
 They hear its chirping accent.

00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:30.020
 And if it's different, they'll kill it.

00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:31.020
 They'll just kill it.

00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:31.860
 - Wow.

00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:35.700
 - Their accents absolutely define who they are as a group.

00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:38.220
 And that's been studied quite a lot recently

00:50:38.220 --> 00:50:40.380
 because there are other animals that speak with accents,

00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:42.460
 but usually they're either water-based

00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:44.420
 or they're constantly moving around like primates.

00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:46.400
 And it's really hard to track and really study,

00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:48.100
 but they have been studying naked mole rats.

00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:50.740
 And yeah, they are just vicious.

00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:52.660
 - They also do that in Newcastle, Andy, by the way,

00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:55.380
 just when we're touring there later this year.

00:50:55.380 --> 00:50:56.780
 Just make sure wherever you go,

00:50:56.780 --> 00:50:58.660
 you always do your Geordie accent.

00:50:58.660 --> 00:50:59.860
 - You won't be able to tell me

00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:03.780
 from born and bred Geordie by the time we get there.

00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:04.780
 It'll be amazing.

00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:06.540
 Oh, here's a weird thing.

00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:10.700
 Okay, so if I say to you,

00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:13.700
 Ants don't sleep in a French accent.

00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:15.860
 - Oh, is that one, that was that French?

00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:16.900
 - That was French, yeah.

00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:18.060
 - Can you do it again?

00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:19.620
 - Ants don't sleep.

00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:20.620
 - I got it, yeah.

00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:21.460
 - In a French accent.

00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:22.620
 It's so clearly a French accent.

00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:23.460
 I can't believe you need it.

00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:24.620
 Yeah, unbelievable.

00:51:24.620 --> 00:51:30.260
 Do you believe me when I say that, that ants don't sleep?

00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:32.980
 - Ants don't sleep.

00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:33.820
 - Okay.

00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:36.220
 - I know, but only because we did it on the podcast.

00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:38.420
 They work 24.

00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:39.900
 I know that's not the point you're trying to make right now,

00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:40.740
 but yeah.

00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:42.620
 - Some of them might sleep, I guess.

00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:43.860
 If some of them work 24 hours,

00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:45.300
 but other ones might sleep.

00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:46.780
 - Oh yeah, there might be species.

00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:47.620
 - I believe you.

00:51:47.620 --> 00:51:49.340
 Perhaps it's because we've been working together

00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:50.180
 for 10 years.

00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:51.420
 (laughing)

00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:53.820
 - So, the accent is relevant here,

00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:56.100
 'cause there was a study by a couple of psychologists

00:51:56.100 --> 00:52:00.380
 about whether people trust more or less information

00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:01.660
 that they hear in a foreign accent,

00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:03.220
 or in their own native accent.

00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:05.180
 And rather depressingly,

00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:07.980
 people trust factual statements less

00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:09.300
 if they hear them in a foreign accent.

00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:10.220
 - Oh, interesting.

00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:12.500
 So does that mean people who listen to this podcast

00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:16.180
 who aren't in the UK are gonna less believe our facts

00:52:16.180 --> 00:52:18.220
 than people in the UK or not?

00:52:18.220 --> 00:52:19.700
 - Americans just think we're a podcast

00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:21.060
 of like, made up, imaginative.

00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:22.700
 (laughing)

00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:24.900
 - And does it also mean that people in the North

00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:27.140
 trust me better than they trust the rest of you?

00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:28.180
 - Maybe, yeah.

00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:30.020
 - People and no one trusts Dan.

00:52:30.020 --> 00:52:30.860
 Is that?

00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:33.900
 - I've got this, and it's hardly rightfully so.

00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:35.220
 (laughing)

00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:38.100
 It's a very rare case where they're totally justified.

00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:38.940
 - Wow.

00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:42.100
 - We actually had the naked mole rat thing

00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:46.020
 for a while in English society, the death by accident thing.

00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:48.060
 So in the 14th century,

00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:51.180
 you could be asked how you pronounced bread and cheese

00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:53.580
 and beheaded if you did it wrong.

00:52:53.580 --> 00:52:56.420
 Specifically, if you said it with a Flemish accent.

00:52:56.420 --> 00:52:58.460
 So, and bizarrely then,

00:52:58.460 --> 00:52:59.540
 so that was 14th century.

00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:02.620
 And then in the 16th century in Friesland,

00:53:02.620 --> 00:53:04.180
 anyone who pronounced bread and cheese

00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:06.420
 with a French accent was beheaded.

00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:11.340
 And this is all about people being kind of racist back then.

00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:12.700
 Still, 'twas ever thus.

00:53:12.700 --> 00:53:14.540
 And this was in the 14th century

00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:16.820
 when the peasants revolt and the Flemish were associated

00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:18.900
 with being sort of merchants.

00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:20.620
 And they came from that part of the world

00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:21.780
 that was doing quite well

00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:23.780
 and the peasants weren't doing well.

00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:25.820
 And so these mobs were got someone to say,

00:53:25.820 --> 00:53:27.220
 "Say bread and cheese."

00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:29.740
 And if they heard a hint of Flemish,

00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:34.740
 so a hint of like, I think it's brought and cause,

00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:38.420
 who knows how they were said 700 years ago,

00:53:38.420 --> 00:53:40.580
 then you got your head off.

00:53:40.580 --> 00:53:42.980
 - Wow, and that's a shibboleth, right?

00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:46.180
 - Exactly, yeah, yeah, it's like a shibboleth.

00:53:46.180 --> 00:53:48.380
 Shibboleth, shit, I'm having beheaded.

00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:51.860
 - There was a thing you were saying before, Andy,

00:53:51.860 --> 00:53:54.780
 about how you have to change an accent

00:53:54.780 --> 00:53:56.700
 in order for people to understand

00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:58.140
 for important moments, right?

00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:00.860
 It's not the same scenario, but in the business world,

00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:02.260
 a lot of companies have been called out

00:54:02.260 --> 00:54:03.620
 because they've been doing things

00:54:03.620 --> 00:54:06.820
 that are called accent neutralization classes.

00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:10.380
 And particularly in America and Tennessee at a nuclear lab,

00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:12.340
 there was a course which was effectively

00:54:12.340 --> 00:54:14.060
 a Southern accent reduction

00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:16.980
 where they got all of the most Southern sounding employees

00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:18.540
 together and said, "We're gonna teach you

00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:21.980
 to soften your accent so that people can understand you."

00:54:21.980 --> 00:54:23.780
 - I reckon if I was at a nuclear lab

00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:26.540
 and anyone called it nuclear,

00:54:26.540 --> 00:54:27.580
 that's what people say, isn't it?

00:54:27.580 --> 00:54:29.180
 Nuclear instead of nuclear,

00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:31.340
 I think I just wouldn't do what they said.

00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:35.180
 So they said, "Oh my God, the nuclear reactor

00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:37.780
 is about to blow, you need to turn this down."

00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:39.380
 I'd be like, "Sorry, what reactor?"

00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:41.100
 (all laughing)

00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:42.180
 - Handing them a pamphlet

00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:44.580
 to the accent neutralization classes.

00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:46.860
 (all laughing)

00:54:46.860 --> 00:54:49.620
 - Do you know the language that is most similar

00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:51.740
 genetically to English?

00:54:51.740 --> 00:54:53.540
 This is kind of, we'll come back to accents.

00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:54.740
 This will weave back around.

00:54:54.740 --> 00:54:58.460
 - I would have said like German or Dutch maybe.

00:54:58.460 --> 00:54:59.700
 - That's pretty close.

00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:01.300
 This is Frisian.

00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:05.780
 So this is, is the closest language to old English,

00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:06.620
 we believe.

00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:08.060
 So basically it's genetically close

00:55:08.060 --> 00:55:11.260
 'cause we're mostly descended from Frisian.

00:55:11.260 --> 00:55:14.500
 And it's so Frisian is from like north of the Netherlands.

00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:17.420
 And one of the really cool things about it

00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:19.380
 is that if you take an English sentence,

00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:22.020
 which is very full of old English words,

00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:24.580
 so you don't have all of that poncy romance language stuff

00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:26.340
 that came in with the French,

00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:28.820
 then it suddenly can sound really similar

00:55:28.820 --> 00:55:30.420
 to this quite obscure language.

00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:34.340
 So bread, butter and green cheese is good English

00:55:34.340 --> 00:55:37.980
 and good Frisian is a sentence in English.

00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:41.940
 And in Frisian, I can't say it very well,

00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:46.620
 but in Frisian it is bread, butter and green cheese

00:55:46.620 --> 00:55:50.620
 is good Ingelsk and good Frisian.

00:55:50.620 --> 00:55:53.020
 And sorry, if you're a Frisian speaker.

00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:54.580
 - I mean, Anna, that just sounded like you

00:55:54.580 --> 00:55:56.420
 after you've had a few drinks.

00:55:56.420 --> 00:56:01.380
 - I make so much sense to the Dutch though.

00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:05.340
 - Okay, that's it.

00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:06.380
 That is all of our facts.

00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:07.980
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:09.580

00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:38.580
 Goodbye.

00:56:38.580 --> 00:56:41.160
 (upbeat music)

00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:53.300
 - I've just realized that I had one other thing.

00:56:53.300 --> 00:56:54.820
 Ants do sleep.

00:56:54.820 --> 00:56:56.620
 Sorry, I should have mentioned it.

00:56:56.620 --> 00:56:57.460
 Should I mention it?

00:56:57.460 --> 00:56:58.300
 - I don't believe you.

00:56:58.300 --> 00:56:59.140
 I do not believe you.

00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:01.380
 (laughing)

00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:03.960
 (upbeat music)

00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:06.540
 (upbeat music)

00:57:06.540 --> 00:57:09.120
 (upbeat music)

00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:11.700
 (upbeat music)
