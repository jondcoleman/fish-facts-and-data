1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:16,800
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,320
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,040
 a weekly podcast coming to you

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,400
 from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,500
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,640
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,080
 Andrew Hunton Murray and James Harkin.

9
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,320
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,120
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

11
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,200
 And in no particular order, here we go.

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,200
 Starting with you, Andy.

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,160
 - My fact is that the founder of the UK's

14
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,360
 first electric vehicle forecourt

15
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,840
 was named after a service station.

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,600
 - Which service station?

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,440
 - This is a man.

18
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,280
 - Was he named TB?

19
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,960
 - He wasn't, he was named Toddington.

20
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,000
 - A classic.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,160
 - Kind of like Paddington Bear actually

22
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,360
 being named after Paddington Station,

23
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,360
 but he's Toddington.

24
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,960
 - Was he founded that service station

25
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,080
 like Paddington Bear was found in?

26
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,280
 - Yeah, he came from South America

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,800
 with a jar of marmalade and no, he wasn't.

28
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,280
 It's a really weird story.

29
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,120
 So he's a guy called Toddington Harper

30
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:17,620
 and he is named after the M1 Toddington Services.

31
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:23,120
 He is actually, I believe the child of some solar pioneers.

32
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,960
 His parents were involved in solar electricity

33
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,880
 when they were younger.

34
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,440
 And he actually has a brother

35
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,960
 who is named Heston after Heston services.

36
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,560
 So both boys in this family are named after service stations.

37
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,400
 - That's amazing.

38
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,120
 - His mum just said, his mum was interviewed.

39
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,200
 There was this piece in the mail

40
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,480
 about this electric forecourt service station thing.

41
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,000
 And his mum said they were driving back from the hospital.

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,200
 They didn't have a name for him

43
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,760
 and they drove through Heston services.

44
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,760
 This was with their first boy

45
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,140
 and they thought Heston's the name.

46
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,080
 And then a few years later, they carried it on.

47
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,960
 - They were on Home Trudes on Radio 4 talking about this.

48
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,400
 And they said that they were driving down the M4

49
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,840
 and they just started reading out the names of places

50
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,320
 they passed to see if any of these would be a decent name.

51
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,320
 So they read out Roe Hampton, Putney, Siemens, Honeywell.

52
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,720
 That was the Heston, that was the first one.

53
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,480
 - So did Toddington get his,

54
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,800
 because that was just a theme

55
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,400
 or was that a different route they took home

56
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,840
 after that hospital?

57
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,600
 - So what happened was they called the first one Heston

58
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,520
 and that is the first service station on the M4.

59
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,720
 And according to the mother,

60
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,320
 she said a friend of mine said,

61
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,680
 "If you've called your first son

62
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,680
 "after the first service station on the M4,

63
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,520
 "how about calling your second son

64
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,320
 "after the first service station on the M1?"

65
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,480
 Right, so that's what she said.

66
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,840
 But Toddington isn't the first service station on the M1.

67
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,800
 The first service station on the M1 is London Gateway.

68
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,320
 So he should have been called London Gateway, I thought.

69
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,560
 But London Gateway is a new name for this service station.

70
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,280
 It's only been called that since 2000.

71
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,440
 And really he should have been called Scratchwood.

72
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,440
 - Nice.

73
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,280
 - I think--

74
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,760
 - That's the first service station historically

75
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,760
 or the first one that you reached geographically.

76
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,640
 - It's the first one as you leave London

77
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,560
 going north bound for the M1 or west bound for the M4.

78
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,400
 - Right.

79
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,000
 The first historically is between two.

80
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,800
 I think you'd have to be called Watford Gap,

81
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,240
 which isn't great, or Newport Pagnell,

82
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,160
 which is quite a cool name, actually, would have been.

83
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,400
 And there's this amazing website

84
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,400
 called MotorwayServicesOnline.co.uk.

85
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,320
 I really think we should start doing a series

86
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,560
 of insanely good websites about really arcade subjects.

87
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,120
 - Like ThatchInfo.com.

88
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,520
 - Exactly.

89
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,200
 The person who made this site has to get together

90
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,280
 with the person who made that one.

91
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,040
 So they go very deep into the debate

92
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,400
 over whether Newport Pagnell

93
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,320
 or Watford Gap are the first service station.

94
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,520
 It is Newport Pagnell.

95
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,440
 It beat Watford Gap by about two weeks in 1960.

96
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,560
 But it's got some other great stuff on it.

97
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,400
 It has a whole page on the Lou of the Year Award

98
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,980
 because the Lou of the Year Award has a section

99
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,560
 about service stations.

100
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,280
 And very sadly, it used to cover three

101
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,680
 for England, Scotland, and Wales,

102
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,080
 but they've had to scale back the awards.

103
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,080
 - Are you talking about the Four Court Trader Awards

104
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,760
 because they have a Four Court Lou of the Year category?

105
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,920
 This is an award ceremony just for Four Courts

106
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,760
 and service stations and things.

107
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,640
 - That's a completely different awards ceremony, Andy.

108
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,080
 It's a very common confusion, though.

109
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,480
 Go on, but presumably you want to talk about them,

110
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,600
 which is relatively unrelated, to be honest, but go on.

111
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,480
 - Okay, well, they've got Best Four Court Lou of the Year

112
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,720
 as a category, and they've also got Best Coffee

113
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,020
 and Hot Beverages Outlet, and Best Car Care

114
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,300
 and Lubricants Outlet as a--

115
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,460
 - Wow, Best Lubricants.

116
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,980
 - Is it car lubricants as well, though?

117
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,460
 It's just car care and then general lubrication.

118
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,980
 - It must be car lubricants.

119
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,280
 Otherwise, that is a very specialist award.

120
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,580
 There's an author called David Lawrence.

121
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,540
 I don't know if he's got anything to do with that website

122
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,380
 that you were talking about, Anna,

123
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:46,380
 but he is pretty much the UK expert on service stations.

124
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,460
 He's written a couple of books about them.

125
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,780
 And there was an interview with him

126
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:53,400
 where he said that he's racked up 11,000 miles

127
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,000
 of motorway driving and eating breakfast

128
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,760
 in over 100 service stations for his research.

129
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,760
 And he said that he once spent Christmas

130
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,360
 in a travel lodge in a service station.

131
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,160
 And they asked him what that was like,

132
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,560
 and he said it was a mixture of being

133
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,880
 in the midst of everyone's Christmas travels

134
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,120
 and also very alone.

135
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,240
 - Oh, but worth it for the fame and glory

136
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,560
 that he's subsequently got.

137
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,080
 - He said that he once stayed in a service station

138
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,540
 in a motel in the UK,

139
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,940
 and the bed hadn't been changed

140
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:26,460
 since the previous occupants had celebrated the wedding night.

141
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,380
 And it still had confetti in the bed.

142
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,000
 And goodness knows what else, probably lubricants.

143
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,860
 - Actually, the travel lodge in Toddington's,

144
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,020
 so the service station that this guy is named after

145
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,300
 used to do this good thing,

146
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,120
 which I think all service stationers should,

147
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,900
 where they had a power nap scheme.

148
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,460
 This is actually according to Alex Horn,

149
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,140
 who wrote this big article on service stations

150
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,060
 'cause he loves them,

151
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,160
 but you could rent a room for three hours.

152
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,240
 And I don't know why that's not absolutely standard, right?

153
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,480
 When you get to a service station,

154
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,240
 so often you just have a half hour nap in your car.

155
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,880
 - I think people don't like to do that

156
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,000
 because it might encourage like what in Japan

157
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,520
 you call love hotels where people just rent by the hour

158
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,960
 and go to check.

159
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,960
 - Yes, I think that makes sense.

160
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,560
 - Was that Alex Horn from Taskmaster?

161
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,680
 - Yes, he does a second string on his bow.

162
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,720
 - He loves him, he loves him.

163
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,020
 Actually, I found, I contacted him last night

164
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,220
 'cause I read that article too,

165
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,020
 and he was talking about one particularly great service station

166
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,820
 called Clacket Lane, it's in Clacket Lane.

167
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:29,660
 And he was saying that as well as fun things they have there,

168
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,180
 like they've got Roman pottery

169
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,980
 that was found at the site on display,

170
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,660
 so you can see that while you're there,

171
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,300
 but they've also got a palm reading machine.

172
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,780
 This is kind of like Zoltar.

173
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,300
 You put your palm into the machine,

174
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,380
 you're handed to the machine,

175
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,260
 and it tells you your future.

176
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,340
 And you get this little ticket

177
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,760
 that tells you what your future's gonna be.

178
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,440
 - Yeah, exactly.

179
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,480
 Interestingly, Clacket Lane as well,

180
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:55,760
 supposedly is the best place on the M25 to hitchhike,

181
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,480
 and that's according to Hitchwiki,

182
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,400
 which I'd never heard of, another fantastic website.

183
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,880
 - Dan, were you googling how to get picked up

184
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,880
 at most of the servers?

185
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,720
 (laughing)

186
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,180
 And you still want to go on Hitchwiki.

187
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,000
 (laughing)

188
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,560
 - Anyone fancy a power nap?

189
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,280
 - One good place where you could get picked up

190
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,840
 at a service station was Watford Gap.

191
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,500
 Back in the day, when it was a place

192
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,300
 where lots of bands used to go,

193
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,380
 and apparently according to Francis Rossi of status quo,

194
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,580
 it used to be where groupies hung out,

195
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,180
 because they knew that all the bands

196
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,580
 would stop at Watford Gap

197
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,860
 on the way to a gig or back from a gig.

198
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,660
 And so as well as going to the backstage door

199
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,340
 or going to the hotels or whatever,

200
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,580
 they used to hang out at Watford Gap services

201
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,620
 to see if they could pick up a rock star.

202
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,900
 - So great.

203
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,100
 - That's, it feels like such a high stakes game, doesn't it?

204
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,620
 'Cause you might pick up a rolling stone or something,

205
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,200
 or you might just spend your entire evening

206
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,260
 at the Watford Gap service.

207
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,080
 (laughing)

208
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,360
 - On your 70 McDonald's,

209
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,480
 all you've met is van drivers so far.

210
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,040
 But yeah, they all used to talk about it.

211
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,360
 It became sort of famous.

212
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,580
 And Ronnie Wood of Rolling Stones fame, obviously,

213
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,680
 said that apparently Jimi Hendrix

214
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,360
 thought that it was a nightclub.

215
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,200
 So it was called the Blue Boar back then.

216
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,920
 The cafe was called Blue Boar.

217
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,440
 And he said Hendrix thought it was a nightclub

218
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,640
 because all of his fellow musicians

219
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,760
 used to go on about stopping up at the Blue Boar.

220
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,080
 So he was so excited to finally get there

221
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,560
 and find that it sold bad coffee.

222
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,140
 And had a big car park.

223
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,340
 And it doesn't even get very rated very highly

224
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,780
 in service station awards now.

225
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,340
 I learned from my favorite website, sadly.

226
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:27,180
 - Did you guys hear the song about the Watford Gap?

227
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,140
 - Yes. - No.

228
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,940
 - So this is by a folk singer called Roy Harper.

229
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,540
 So he's a very famous folk musician

230
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,660
 and he, there's a Led Zeppelin song

231
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,700
 called Hats Off to Roy Harper.

232
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,140
 He's a pretty big deal.

233
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,700
 He released a song called Watford Gap

234
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,620
 which was so rude about the Watford Gap

235
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,600
 that its owners kind of called in the lawyers.

236
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,160
 And they, some people intervened

237
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,760
 and got it taken off the album.

238
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,640
 So here are some of the lines from it.

239
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,120
 Just about a mile from where the motorways all merge,

240
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,760
 you can view the national edifice,

241
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,440
 a monumental splurge.

242
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,280
 It's the lonesome traveler's rock gut

243
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,720
 or bacteria's revenge.

244
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,040
 The great plastic spectacular descendant of Stonehenge.

245
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,000
 The countryside is ravaged like a syphilitic whore.

246
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,320
 Yodeling up the canyon is the dirty old Blue Boar.

247
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,960
 And they didn't like it.

248
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,020
 Watford Gap, Watford Gap, it's a load of crap.

249
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,900
 You can go there for a two hour nap

250
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,180
 but you might get the clap.

251
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,780
 That's what I would love for.

252
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,340
 - That's very strong.

253
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:23,740
 - The American pioneer of petrol stations

254
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:27,780
 was a man whose name was Sylvarnus Freelove Bowser.

255
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,460
 - Wow.

256
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,420
 - That was his name.

257
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,340
 - The head of Nintendo is called Bowser, isn't he?

258
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,140
 People send us that from time to time.

259
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,420
 Yeah, 'cause Bowser is also a character in...

260
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,460
 Did he always know about Mario Kart?

261
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,900
 - In Mario Kart, yeah.

262
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,500
 - So is the evil guy.

263
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,520
 - I guess maybe some relation between Sylvarnus Freelove

264
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,600
 and the head of Nintendo, I don't know.

265
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,400
 - Well, we're also talking about with this fact

266
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,880
 about electric cars, right?

267
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,280
 And so just as a connection to that,

268
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,600
 the Tesla, there's a lot of Easter eggs in the Tesla

269
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,200
 that sort of have been programmed either by Elon Musk

270
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,760
 or the nerds from within there.

271
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,320
 And one of them is that while you're driving,

272
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,720
 if you rapidly press the autopilot button

273
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,860
 four times in a row, the street on your display

274
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,820
 will turn from the standard road

275
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,120
 into rainbow road from Mario Kart.

276
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,180
 (laughing)

277
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,220
 - Wait a minute, but in rainbow road,

278
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,260
 my memory says that it's very easy

279
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,740
 to fall off that road, isn't it?

280
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,340
 - Yes, yeah.

281
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,900
 It's the most dangerous of tracks

282
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,500
 in the classic Mario Kart, yeah.

283
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,060
 - There was that thing which I was gonna do

284
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,900
 as a fact on this show that if you say open butthole,

285
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:38,300
 then it opens the thing that you use to charge the car up.

286
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,120
 - Like the voice activation system.

287
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:40,960
 - Is that deliberate?

288
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,800
 That's an Easter egg.

289
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,120
 It's not some accident 'cause it sounds like something.

290
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,960
 (laughing)

291
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,800
 I don't know what.

292
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,360
 - Like bolt hole or something.

293
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,200
 I don't know.

294
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,080
 - God, I don't know if I want Easter eggs in my car.

295
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,640
 You don't want to go, oh, maybe if you do three left turns

296
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,880
 in a row, the drive will be ejected or something.

297
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,640
 (laughing)

298
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,480
 - Well, here's another one.

299
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,880
 If you tap the corner of the top main monitor, the T,

300
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,800
 if you tap it three times, it turns into a touchscreen

301
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,620
 and you can start drawing with a color palette.

302
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,660
 So you can just start doing whatever drawings you want.

303
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,380
 You have to do it as the passenger, obviously.

304
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,900
 This is not for the driver.

305
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,500
 And then you submit it afterwards to Tesla

306
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,220
 and they critique your drawing for you.

307
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,500
 - Wow, is that Elon Musk personally?

308
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,660
 Is that what he does now?

309
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,180
 He just sits in a study critiquing people's drawings.

310
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,140
 - It feels like that.

311
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,260
 And he sends you 10 million doge coins

312
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,040
 for the best one or something.

313
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,980
 - I think the very first electric car was designed

314
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,880
 in 1839, so they didn't catch on at all

315
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,000
 and they weren't used publicly.

316
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,160
 But this guy called Moritz von Jacoby,

317
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,960
 who was a Russian engineer.

318
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,040
 So they've been around about the same time

319
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,640
 there was a boat that carried passengers

320
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,840
 that was electric powered.

321
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,840
 And he built an electric car that he exhibited

322
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,600
 around Scotland and he just couldn't get people

323
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,440
 interested in it.

324
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,680
 So people like, I don't see any use to this.

325
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,120
 The only people who were interested were railway workers

326
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,840
 and they were afraid it was gonna supplant the railway.

327
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,700
 And so they smashed it up in his garage

328
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,220
 in the middle of the night and took 40 years

329
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,580
 before it took off again.

330
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,420
 - Wow.

331
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,740
 - Yeah, rough.

332
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,300
 - So much what might have been stuff about this.

333
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,860
 It's obviously so nice to imagine, you know,

334
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,420
 all the cars were electric, working me off.

335
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,400
 - And then thanks to bloody cyclists such as myself

336
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,820
 who claim we're so environmentally friendly these days,

337
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,060
 but we killed the electric car

338
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,860
 because it was the improvement of road surfaces

339
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,940
 in the late 19th century by kind of cyclists

340
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,320
 pushing for improved road surfaces so they could go touring,

341
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,600
 which meant that people wanted to go on longer drives.

342
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,440
 And the one problem with electric cars back then

343
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,520
 was the same as now,

344
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,440
 which is that they didn't have very big range.

345
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,320
 And so suddenly gasoline petrol cars took off

346
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,520
 'cause they could drive a long way

347
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,320
 over these newly surfaced roads.

348
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,960
 So cyclists got a lot to answer for actually.

349
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,800
 - But then when they did know

350
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,960
 that they couldn't go very far

351
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,240
 and so they aimed the electric cars directly at women.

352
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,360
 So in the 1910s and going into the 1920s,

353
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,940
 you would get these advertisements

354
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,220
 like for the Argo company.

355
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,700
 They advertised their electric vehicle as a woman's car

356
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,600
 that any man is proud to drive.

357
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,540
 And the idea was that women wouldn't want

358
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,620
 to go on long journeys.

359
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,580
 They would much rather kind of poodle around the city

360
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,420
 or whatever.

361
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,140
 And so we're more likely to buy these cars.

362
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:25,980
 - More poodle.

363
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,620
 - That's so, that's classic women.

364
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,460
 They hate distance.

365
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,300
 They hate the notion of distance.

366
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,900
 They take a brain to kind of absorb those big numbers.

367
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,580
 Did anyone else think when James said

368
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,900
 the only way to use electric cars was to aim them at women

369
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,940
 that you literally were saying

370
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,500
 you're pointing electric cars at women?

371
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,500
 Put your foot down.

372
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,580
 - That's another Easter egg on the Tesla.

373
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:48,160
 (upbeat music)

374
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:55,560
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Anna.

375
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,020
 - My fact this week is that from 1975 to 2004,

376
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:02,300
 it was illegal to buy the world's most popular

377
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,980
 collection of jazz music.

378
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:07,860
 And when I say jazz music, I mean sheet music.

379
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,860
 So jazz music that you play.

380
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,180
 So this is this thing called the real book.

381
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:15,740
 And I learned about it on a 99% invisible episode

382
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:18,820
 that I was pointed to by the browser.

383
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,260
 So I just want to point out if there's anyone left

384
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,060
 in the country who hasn't discovered the browser.com,

385
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,180
 it's an amazing site which curates great articles for you.

386
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,060
 - God, I've been signed up to the bowser.com

387
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:31,100
 which has the details of people called bowser.

388
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:31,940
 (laughing)

389
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,620
 It's not coming handy for 300 episodes.

390
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,580
 - So okay, they don't really want your type on there.

391
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,860
 It's sort of a highbrow thing.

392
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:43,300
 Anyway, thebrowser.com pointed me towards the real book

393
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,940
 which is the definitive book of jazz tunes

394
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,340
 for anyone who wants to play jazz.

395
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,700
 Anyone who is a jazz musician out there,

396
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,980
 I'm sure will know it.

397
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:56,060
 And this was made in 1974

398
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:59,180
 and it was published and sold

399
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,060
 without any kind of copyright releases

400
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:04,420
 or any permissions or any royalties arranged or anything.

401
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,740
 It was just written out, printed off

402
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,020
 and then sold in sort of back alleyways

403
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:12,140
 and in people's bedrooms, student bedrooms

404
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,940
 and every jazz student has to have it.

405
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,580
 And it's basically all the jazz standards

406
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,740
 as they're called from the beginning of jazz

407
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,900
 from the 1920s and even before that you need

408
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,180
 if you want to entertain someone in a bar.

409
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,380
 - It's amazing the story of how it came about as well.

410
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,780
 It's sort of originated with the fact that radio stations

411
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,740
 needed to work out how to pay copyrights and royalties

412
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,140
 towards the composers of certain songs

413
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,620
 and they had a really hard time doing it.

414
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,020
 So they created this thing called the tune decks

415
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,940
 and they were index cards that on one side

416
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,860
 had the information about a particular song.

417
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,020
 So it would have your composer's name

418
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,540
 or any of the information that you would need for payment.

419
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,740
 And on the other side,

420
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,820
 they would have literally the sheet music

421
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,540
 but like a section of the song

422
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,220
 so that anyone who was playing the song

423
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,100
 could identify it via the lyrics

424
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,180
 or by literally the notes on the staves.

425
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,340
 - And when you say playing, you mean like

426
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,660
 if you're a radio DJ, anyone who's putting the song on.

427
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,980
 So it's like, you'll hear the song

428
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,420
 and then you can skim through these cards

429
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,060
 and be like, oh yeah, that looks like the tune.

430
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,940
 So I can say, this is Blah-dee-blah

431
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,820
 by so-and-so, probably.

432
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,700
 - Does that mean a DJ would have to be able

433
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,100
 to read music to even-

434
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,180
 - That's what it sounded like.

435
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,020
 - Yeah.

436
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:16,860
 - It does sound like that.

437
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,980
 And so one of the reasons that they became quite popular

438
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,300
 was because musicians found them really useful

439
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,860
 for when they were going to gigs

440
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,300
 to be able to use them basically as cheat sheets

441
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,740
 so that they could look at it

442
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,660
 and fake their way through a popular song

443
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,260
 that they didn't necessarily know.

444
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,180
 And because it's jazz and free-flowing,

445
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,860
 you can venture off the main theme

446
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,220
 but it's the essence of it.

447
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,380
 - It gives you the basics

448
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,580
 and then from there, you can kind of fake it.

449
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,420
 - Yes.

450
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:44,420
 - It gives you the chords and the kind of melody

451
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,260
 and the lyrics.

452
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,340
 And as Dan says, you just riff off the back of that

453
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,340
 which you do anyway.

454
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,180
 - Cool.

455
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:52,180
 - And then you said that it was legal in 2004

456
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:55,460
 and that's because a company made a legal version

457
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,220
 where they got all the copyrights from people

458
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,660
 and stuff like that, right?

459
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,500
 - Yes.

460
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,540
 And lots of other publishers tried to publish

461
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,660
 actual books of jazz tunes

462
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:06,220
 but this because it had evolved over 50, 60, 70 years,

463
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,060
 nothing could compete.

464
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,300
 So yeah, I think in the end,

465
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,100
 it was Hal Leonard music publishers, wasn't it?

466
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,820
 Who got all the rights to all the songs

467
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,020
 which must have been held.

468
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:13,860
 - Yeah.

469
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,780
 I think the reason other publishers couldn't compete

470
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,500
 was that they were trying to do it legally.

471
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,820
 (laughing)

472
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,900
 I asked a friend of mine,

473
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,540
 my friend Will who is a jazz saxophonist,

474
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,740
 I asked him, have you heard of the real book?

475
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,140
 And he said, of course I have.

476
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,300
 And he said, there are many editions

477
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,700
 and I own many editions.

478
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,940
 And I, he said that--

479
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,660
 - Illegal editions Andy or the legal ones.

480
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,460
 - I'm not saying, I'm not dropping him in there

481
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,780
 although I have an active on this podcast.

482
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,100
 - What is it called, Will?

483
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:39,940
 - Will, yeah.

484
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:40,780
 - All right, Will, yeah.

485
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,100
 - Will Gumbins, yeah, yeah.

486
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,380
 (laughing)

487
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,260
 But he said that until the sixth edition,

488
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,380
 they didn't have quite enough of the standards for it

489
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,580
 to be, you know, all encompassing comprehensive.

490
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,300
 So apparently you want the sick edition onwards

491
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,980
 if you're in the market.

492
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,660
 - It's kind of hard to,

493
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,820
 'cause so many tunes in the whole point of jazz, I suppose,

494
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,460
 or lots of the point of it is that there's lots

495
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,300
 of improvisation.

496
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,900
 It's kind of hard to know in the real book

497
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,500
 which bits have come from who.

498
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,680
 So, you know, if someone's got a brilliant

499
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,580
 do-be-do, do-be-do moment.

500
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,420
 - Oh yeah.

501
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,980
 - And they play that on the night.

502
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:12,820
 Does that--

503
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:13,660
 - That's Miles Dovers, I think.

504
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,500
 Isn't it unmistakable?

505
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,660
 - Yeah, that's right, yeah.

506
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,180
 You know, as in who kind of owns that

507
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,860
 is a really vexed question.

508
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,900
 They had jazz diplomacy, of course.

509
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:27,420
 The idea being that America would send jazz musicians out

510
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:31,940
 to countries that were threatened by communism.

511
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:35,340
 And the jazz musicians would make people think

512
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,620
 that America's a great place

513
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,180
 'cause it has this kind of subversive music.

514
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:42,060
 And this was started by a congressman called

515
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,780
 Adam Clayton Powell Jr.,

516
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,700
 who was an African-American congressman

517
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,340
 who represented Harlem.

518
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,660
 But it wasn't really his idea.

519
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,820
 It was his wife's idea.

520
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,780
 His wife was called Hazel Scott

521
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,100
 and she was a jazz pianist.

522
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,020
 And she was amazing.

523
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,980
 She was the first black American to host her own TV show,

524
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,360
 the Hazel Scott Show.

525
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,140
 She would never play in a place

526
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,780
 where there was any segregation

527
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,780
 between black and white people.

528
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,260
 She would turn up and then if there was any segregation,

529
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,540
 she'd walk away and cause riots a lot of the time

530
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,940
 'cause she wouldn't play.

531
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,340
 But she was eventually brought down

532
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,700
 because people thought she was a communist.

533
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,860
 - But the interesting thing,

534
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,380
 or another interesting thing about her

535
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,900
 is that her grandson, Adam C. Powell IV,

536
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,540
 currently runs a company that's trying to find greener ways

537
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,300
 to find rare earth metals for electric cars.

538
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,900
 So we've come a full circle to the electric car stuff.

539
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,740
 - Very nice.

540
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,340
 - This is the Powell family podcast.

541
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,060
 (all laughing)

542
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:40,380
 - Well, there was a thing in the First World War called,

543
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,900
 this was, I guess, this was not jazz diplomacy.

544
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,220
 In fact, it was the opposite, it was jazz war

545
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:49,420
 because there was a regiment called the Harlem Hellfighters.

546
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,480
 That was their nickname

547
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,460
 and they were the 369th US infantry,

548
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,340
 largely recruited from Harlem.

549
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:58,780
 And so, and it had a lot of musicians in it, the regiment.

550
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,940
 And as they arrived in France, they played jazz

551
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,820
 and people in France,

552
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,900
 maybe some people in Paris had had jazz before,

553
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:08,660
 but people in, you know, 1917 in rural France

554
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,900
 had not had jazz.

555
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,100
 And as they arrived, they played a jazz version

556
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,060
 of the Marseillais and it blew people's minds.

557
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,380
 And there was a kind of mini craze

558
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,380
 which got called ragtimeitis.

559
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:22,420
 As a result of it, people hadn't had syncopated rhythms

560
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,020
 before playing off the beat.

561
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,220
 This is insane.

562
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,020
 - In World War II, there was also a bit of jazz war

563
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,180
 waged by Britain who launched a jazz radio station

564
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:34,100
 in Germany, which I had never read about.

565
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,180
 But this was basically a surrogateous way

566
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:39,500
 to poison the minds of Germans against the Nazis.

567
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,660
 And it involves setting up a jazz station

568
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:44,780
 and the announcer on it was a woman called Agnes Bernel.

569
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,900
 She was actually a German expat.

570
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,900
 She'd fled Nazi Germany and landed in Britain.

571
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,220
 And they said, can you be a DJ on a fake jazz radio station?

572
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,700
 And through you, we'll get loads of secret messages out there

573
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,100
 to basically to plant chaos.

574
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,740
 For instance, she commiserated at one point

575
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:04,020
 with a specific German U-boat captain saying,

576
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,540
 you must be so hard for him

577
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,460
 'cause he hasn't been on leave for two years.

578
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,740
 But congratulations on the birth of his son at home.

579
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,860
 That's why I've just given birth to a son.

580
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:15,100
 And this guy got one.

581
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,940
 - So she was pregnant for over two years.

582
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:17,980
 That's amazing.

583
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,380
 - Very long gestation period.

584
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,540
 - I've just understood the implication.

585
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:24,020
 - Wow, I'm naive.

586
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:27,180
 - He was captaining a boat off the coast of Scotland

587
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:30,100
 and he went to the coast and surrendered and said,

588
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,100
 saw this, my wife just shagged someone else.

589
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:32,940
 I'm out.

590
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,540
 Surrendered that boat.

591
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,820
 So it worked.

592
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,500
 But there was another thing that she was reminiscing about

593
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,860
 on the show I listened to her on,

594
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:43,420
 which was that she announced on this radio station

595
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,340
 that Allied saboteurs in SS uniforms

596
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,220
 had been dropped in a particular region.

597
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,620
 And so SS cars went all over this region,

598
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,860
 arresting each other.

599
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:54,700
 Whenever they saw each other they arrested each other.

600
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,140
 - That's a great idea.

601
00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:00,020
 - Have you guys heard of Russ and Roland Kirk?

602
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,700
 - No.

603
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:05,660
 - I think he might be my favorite jazz player ever.

604
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,420
 I only found him in the course of researching this,

605
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:11,500
 but he was blind from a very young age.

606
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,660
 And in spite of that,

607
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,140
 he not only mastered saxophone,

608
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:17,340
 he managed to master playing three saxophones

609
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,180
 at the same time.

610
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,160
 - Hang on.

611
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,980
 - Okay, how much orificence is he?

612
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:22,820
 - Incredible.

613
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:25,860
 - I could imagine blowing it three on that,

614
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:26,780
 or three on your mouth,

615
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,340
 but he's not blown through his ears or his anus, is he?

616
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,180
 - He wasn't.

617
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,660
 No, he was not.

618
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,300
 He had three saxophones around his neck

619
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,700
 and he could fit all three into his mouth,

620
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,820
 stretched out at the same time.

621
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,140
 - Okay, for the listeners,

622
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,820
 Andy was stretching his mouth out there

623
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:44,300
 by putting his index fingers into the sides of his mouth

624
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,700
 and pulling them sideways.

625
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,340
 - Yeah.

626
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,820
 - That can't have been a good sound.

627
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,660
 Did it work?

628
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,700
 - It sounds all right.

629
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,540
 - Does it?

630
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,500
 - I mean, yeah, but he doesn't have enough hands.

631
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,340
 - Yeah, I was going to say,

632
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,620
 it's not just mouths that you need to play saxophone.

633
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:01,020
 - Okay, this is where it gets interesting.

634
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,440
 He had six hands.

635
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:09,340
 He uses his two hands on two sets of keys

636
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:11,180
 and lets the third saxophone go for the moment,

637
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,660
 but he's always shifting hands between the saxes.

638
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,860
 It's better than I've made it sound.

639
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,980
 And he could also play the flute with his mouth

640
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,740
 while playing the recorder with his nose.

641
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,540
 That he was unbelievably talented.

642
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:25,620
 - That's very cool.

643
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:29,540
 I did a quick search into sort of other jazz books

644
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,460
 that are out there that we might not have heard of.

645
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:34,340
 And it led me to discover a book that was published

646
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:38,660
 by one of the great American jazz musicians, Charles Mingus,

647
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:41,380
 who I actually, I grew up listening to.

648
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,720
 He's an extraordinary musician.

649
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,540
 And it turns out that after his gigs,

650
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,820
 he used to sell a self-published book.

651
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:52,300
 It was a sort of pamphlet, which he called a catalog,

652
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,480
 cat hyphen a log.

653
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,420
 And it was a book that was toilet training for your cat,

654
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,660
 which he was obsessed by.

655
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:02,620
 So he had a cat called Nightlife,

656
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:05,780
 who he claims he took three to four weeks to train,

657
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,820
 to sit on a toilet.

658
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:11,460
 And the whole pamphlet is his step-by-step guide

659
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,540
 for how you can make this happen.

660
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,700
 And so it starts with, you've got to teach them

661
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,340
 to go to a kitty litter to begin with,

662
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:21,740
 slowly inch that box towards the bathroom.

663
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,260
 Once you've reached the bathroom

664
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,660
 and they feel comfortable going there,

665
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,820
 put the box on top of the toilet,

666
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:29,300
 then cut a hole in the, this is over, you know,

667
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:33,460
 a period of wheat, cut a hole at the bottom of the cardboard,

668
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,420
 then gradually cut the box down.

669
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,660
 So it's just a flat bit of paper.

670
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:40,100
 And eventually you'll find, he said,

671
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,660
 "You'll be hearing in the night just flushing noises

672
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:45,300
 from the toilet as your cat has taken itself

673
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,140
 to the toilet."

674
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,620
 - Sorry, the cat flushes it after this.

675
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,060
 - This is, Nightlife apparently does this.

676
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,500
 - So is this Charlie Mingus' cat?

677
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,820
 Charles Mingus' cat?

678
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:57,580
 Charles Mingus, as well as sustaining

679
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,100
 the incredible jazz career he did,

680
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,180
 was house training a cat.

681
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,700
 It's, I can't believe that.

682
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,540
 - I know, it's extraordinary.

683
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,980
 And honestly, after gigs, this is what he would sell.

684
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,100
 This was like his big push.

685
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:09,660
 He printed ads up where he was doing mail order

686
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,180
 so that you could buy these pamphlets.

687
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,180
 - So there is another jazz book, which is so weird,

688
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,940
 called A Cat O'Logue,

689
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,580
 which this might have been in response to

690
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,980
 'cause it was by Cab Calloway.

691
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:20,860
 In 1938, he published Cab Calloway's Cat O'Logue,

692
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,260
 A Hepster's Dictionary,

693
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:25,340
 which was the first dictionary written

694
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:28,140
 by an African-American and it was the Jive Language

695
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,900
 reference book of the New York Public Library.

696
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,260
 So if you went to the library and you wanted to know

697
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,860
 about Jive Talk, this is the book you'd get.

698
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:37,860
 - And the cat there is like a hep cat, I guess, right?

699
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,940
 - Exactly, yeah.

700
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:42,500
 So is it possible Charlie Mingus was referring

701
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,340
 nodding to that?

702
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:47,940
 - In my reading, I didn't see any of that as a pun reference.

703
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:50,020
 - Awful if you mistakenly got the wrong one.

704
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,540
 You'll never train that cat,

705
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,780
 but it will speak very good Jive.

706
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:56,180
 So this back was about the black market.

707
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,500
 So selling music on the black market.

708
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,060
 So I had to look at some of the black market stuff.

709
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,420
 What do you reckon is the most expensive

710
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:06,020
 of your bodily organs on the black market?

711
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:10,260
 - Eyeballs.

712
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:14,660
 - Oh, corneas, $30,000 on the black market about.

713
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,820
 This is according to the website Ranker,

714
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,340
 which has got quite a few.

715
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,660
 It does have quite a lot of good sources in this list.

716
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,460
 So I can't, I'll say,

717
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:26,300
 a kidney.

718
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,820
 - Oh, got it in one, Andy.

719
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:28,660
 I can't believe it.

720
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,500
 Yeah, kidney.

721
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,780
 So apparently if you wanna buy a kidney on the black market,

722
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:35,860
 it's gonna cost you approximately $200,000.

723
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:38,820
 And they sourced for that a book called

724
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,780
 Cultural Anthropology by William Haveland,

725
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,900
 which came out in 2010.

726
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,620
 So it might be quite a bit more than that now.

727
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:47,500
 But compared to $200,000 for your kidneys,

728
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,660
 about $157,000 for your liver.

729
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,860
 That's what you said, Anna, wasn't it?

730
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:54,900
 So probably second, your heart,

731
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,860
 apparently an illegally obtained heart

732
00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:00,660
 is only worth about $119,000.

733
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,540
 And I think the reason for that is,

734
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:07,540
 you need to have such a specialist to put your heart in.

735
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:11,020
 Really, if you're in a situation where you need a new heart,

736
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,900
 you're probably in a legit hospital.

737
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,100
 So there's not many people on the street corner going,

738
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,900
 "Anyone got a heart?"

739
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:18,740
 - Oh, it's kidneys.

740
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,140
 You can just ram it in, can't you?

741
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,180
 - Stop it, I'll put it on, hope for the best.

742
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,020
 (laughing)

743
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,220
 That's one way, yeah.

744
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,340
 - When you say street corners,

745
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:29,300
 is that like, I feel like it's more,

746
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,860
 that's more high-end selling, right?

747
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:33,060
 Because I imagine I've got a kidney

748
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:36,820
 or I've got a bootleg copy of, you know, grown-ups too.

749
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:41,140
 You know, those are the things I'd expect on a street corner.

750
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:43,580
 - I don't think it's just, it's probably, it is.

751
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,300
 I mean, apart from anything else,

752
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,500
 if you're giving someone a kidney,

753
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,220
 it has to be kept in a very sterile,

754
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,460
 very cold environment.

755
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:53,260
 It can't be, you can't open up your coat

756
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,460
 and on the inside lining,

757
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,740
 it's just got a load of organs just hanging off it.

758
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,100
 That's not gonna work out.

759
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,820
 (laughing)

760
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,660
 - Thanks for a lovely coat, though.

761
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,500
 - Yeah.

762
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,020
 - Sounds like something Lady Gargoyle would wear.

763
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:04,860
 - Yes.

764
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:07,440
 (upbeat music)

765
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,740
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three

766
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,460
 and that is James.

767
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,940
 - Okay, my fact this week is that the world's longest

768
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:20,380
 water slide is almost 20 times longer

769
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,300
 than the world's shortest river.

770
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,900
 - Insane.

771
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,740
 - Great.

772
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,140
 - Which one is more surprising?

773
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,060
 What, what are the lengths?

774
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,580
 And I'll decide which one I'm more surprised by.

775
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,460
 The shortness of the river or the length of the water slide?

776
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,700
 - Okay, well, the river,

777
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,020
 which we might get onto a bit later

778
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,300
 'cause it's a bit controversial,

779
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:41,100
 the river is 201 feet or 61 meters long

780
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:46,980
 and the water slide is 1,111 meters.

781
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:52,740
 So that's over a kilometer long, 3,645 feet.

782
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,380
 - So cool.

783
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,220
 - It's amazing.

784
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:58,500
 - I think the water slide is a more stunning one

785
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,540
 to go over a kilometer in a water slide.

786
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:04,700
 And this is in Penang, which is in Malaysia,

787
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,420
 in northern Malaysia.

788
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,100
 And it was recently featured

789
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,940
 on the Guinness World Records YouTube channel

790
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,660
 where they showed a video of someone

791
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:16,260
 going all the way down this water slide.

792
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,180
 And like I say, it's four minutes long.

793
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,820
 And to get to this water slide,

794
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:22,940
 you have to go on a cable car chairlift.

795
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,860
 You can't just walk up the stairs or anything

796
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,780
 like you would in a normal water park.

797
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:29,460
 It's one of those where you're in like a little rubber ring

798
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,460
 and you go down there.

799
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,900
 - The best kind.

800
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:33,740
 - Yeah.

801
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,340
 - Relaxing, but also thrilling, I think, yeah.

802
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,900
 - Oh, that's kind of controversial statement.

803
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,100
 - No, because it is better

804
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:44,100
 because the water doesn't jet up you in the same way.

805
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:47,740
 - Some people like that, I must say.

806
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,680
 - Yeah, okay, yeah.

807
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,960
 - Tickles like kidneys.

808
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:56,380
 But yeah, some people just like the simplicity

809
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,780
 of just sitting down and you're swimming cosy

810
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,580
 and going straight down on your bum.

811
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:01,420
 - It's very true.

812
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,260
 - It's very true.

813
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,080
 - You've got no protection.

814
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,740
 The ring takes away some of the risk factor.

815
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,940
 - And that's what I like about it.

816
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:07,780
 - Yep.

817
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,620
 (all laughing)

818
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:11,380
 - I think also a ring like sometimes it makes you go

819
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:13,860
 further off the edge and makes it feel a bit scarier

820
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:14,700
 if you're going fast.

821
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,100
 - It is scarier, I agree.

822
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,060
 If you take a corner too hard,

823
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:20,620
 you risk flying out of the whole thing.

824
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,540
 That's happened to me a couple of times.

825
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,380
 - Really?

826
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,140
 - Yeah, and it's petrifying.

827
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:25,980
 - You've come out.

828
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:29,540
 - Well, I sort of went a bit over the lip on a corner

829
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,980
 and that really scared me to never really push it

830
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,420
 on a water slide ever again.

831
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,820
 What's amazing though about this water slide is that--

832
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:36,940
 - I'm just imagining how lame

833
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,500
 you all are at a water park.

834
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,340
 (all laughing)

835
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,160
 - What?

836
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,460
 - I'm going, I had a terrifying experience

837
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,860
 when I went quite far up the wall

838
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,700
 and you're going, oh, I'd rather do this sort of

839
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:48,340
 in a car so that I'm not touching any cars or anything.

840
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,180
 (all laughing)

841
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:52,260
 - I always keep my hands on the side to slow me down.

842
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,420
 And then I have to push myself along

843
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,380
 'cause the water's not pushing me.

844
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,220
 - Yeah.

845
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,060
 (all laughing)

846
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,740
 - It's a shinski behind me, probably.

847
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,540
 I'm doing a bomb shape.

848
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,180
 (all laughing)

849
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,620
 - Bloody rocket on the back of it.

850
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,140
 (all laughing)

851
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,860
 - But this visually, this is an amazing water slide.

852
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,380
 Like the first thing to say about it

853
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,140
 is it's a physical water slide.

854
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,900
 So the previous sort of, the previous record

855
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:19,140
 for the longest water slide was in Vernon, New Jersey.

856
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,180
 And that was an inflatable water slide,

857
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,860
 which is what I immediately pictured

858
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,220
 when you sent this fact, James.

859
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:28,900
 But this goes through this beautiful dense forest

860
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,900
 and it's open-top and you're just, you know,

861
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,180
 you're going through trees and it's absolutely--

862
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,020
 - Oh, wow.

863
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,580
 - It's basically, if you flip out of that, Dan,

864
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:39,300
 you're living with the squirrels for quite a few years

865
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,980
 before they find you again, thank you.

866
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,740
 (all laughing)

867
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,460
 - That's how Tarzan starts, isn't it?

868
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,860
 (all laughing)

869
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,100
 So is it a straight line?

870
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,460
 It's not winding around around a hundred inches.

871
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,900
 - No, very much winding, yeah.

872
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,660
 You end up quite close to where you began.

873
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:54,500
 - Good to know.

874
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,340
 - And it has leisurely bits in it as well,

875
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,580
 where it sort of goes on a bit more of a flat

876
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,420
 and you just, you know,

877
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:02,140
 you just go along quite nicely pushed by the stream.

878
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:04,380
 Now that sounds interesting to me.

879
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,220
 - That's Andy's comment.

880
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,060
 (all laughing)

881
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,980
 - Andy's reading Pride and Prejudice on the way down

882
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,300
 is waterproof copy.

883
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,340
 (all laughing)

884
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:14,540
 - Yeah, I've never really sort of looked into

885
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,380
 or thought about water slides at all before,

886
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,500
 but they're amazing.

887
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,660
 They, you know, I really like the pioneer of water sliding,

888
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,700
 Dick Krull.

889
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,140
 - One of them.

890
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,460
 - Oh, his sound fun.

891
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,980
 Like, oh, and Dick Krull's water slide.

892
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,300
 - It sounds like an original name for Dick Dastardly,

893
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,140
 doesn't it?

894
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,740
 - Yeah.

895
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:35,380
 - He dug a five acre lake,

896
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:38,580
 which he was going to be using for bass fishing.

897
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,620
 Bass the fish, obviously.

898
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,500
 (all laughing)

899
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,140
 - Not the make of better.

900
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:45,980
 - I'm sorry, yeah.

901
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,340
 (all laughing)

902
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,860
 - And then he had all this dirt

903
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,420
 and he shaped the dirt into this massive great ramp,

904
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:55,220
 350 feet long, which was a waterfall.

905
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,260
 And then he realized it could be

906
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,860
 a recreational water slide.

907
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,940
 And that was supposedly the world's first,

908
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,460
 but actually I think there was some.

909
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:02,300
 - When was that?

910
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,540
 - That was '71.

911
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,100
 - '71, okay, yeah.

912
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:09,540
 - Oh, 'cause there was another guy who dug his own lake

913
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:12,220
 with similar results called Bob Byers.

914
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,940
 And he created Lake Dolores.

915
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,620
 He called it, it was named after his wife.

916
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,780
 And this was a water park, a recreational water park

917
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:20,140
 that he created just for his family.

918
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:22,980
 This was in the late fifties that he did this.

919
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,460
 So he made this lake in a series of pools and channels

920
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,780
 and people would drive past it and noticed it

921
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,820
 and rocked up and would be like,

922
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:31,460
 "Hey, can I have a go in this fun recreational lake

923
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,300
 "you've created?"

924
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:36,380
 And so then, yeah, he added eight 150 foot slides.

925
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:39,700
 And he also added, which doesn't seem to exist anymore,

926
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,780
 two standing slides.

927
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,540
 And they're really cool photos of doing this.

928
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,540
 So they're kind of in a V shape.

929
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,420
 So you stand up and your feet are just squashed

930
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,220
 into the little bottom of the V.

931
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,620
 And you shoot down very fast.

932
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,660
 I think they go at like a 60 degree slope.

933
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,380
 So really steep.

934
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:57,060
 And you're on a little, it looks like you're on a little,

935
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,500
 you know, those floats you'd have in a pool

936
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,180
 before you could swim, like standing on one of those.

937
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,700
 - What do you mean before?

938
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,180
 I don't know if you can swim or not.

939
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,020
 - Yeah, they are.

940
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:09,380
 - Of course, your mum makes you bring them

941
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,700
 into the office every day in case it rains.

942
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,900
 Yeah, it sounds amazing.

943
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,500
 And then it's shut down.

944
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,100
 - Did you see the sort of like original,

945
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,980
 original water slides?

946
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:24,100
 The ones that didn't have water on them?

947
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:24,940
 Have you spotted those ones?

948
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,540
 - Like just slides, are they?

949
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,740
 - Yeah, there were slides,

950
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:28,900
 but you ended up in the water.

951
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,420
 So they got the ending right,

952
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:32,340
 but they didn't get the initial bit.

953
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,620
 Well, actually, you didn't even really end up in the water.

954
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,980
 Basically what it was is in New Zealand

955
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,620
 as part of the 1906 International Exhibition,

956
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,860
 they had this wonderland.

957
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:44,300
 And they created these slides where you went down in boats.

958
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:48,740
 And once you got to the bottom, you traveled, you know,

959
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:51,740
 you were basically skimming across the water in a boat

960
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,020
 as you got to the bottom.

961
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:57,020
 And that got developed later in 1923 to Herbert Selner,

962
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:59,500
 who lived in America, who created it,

963
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,020
 but with a sort of sled.

964
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,700
 So when you went down on the sled,

965
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,460
 you would eventually topple into the water,

966
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,820
 but it got you about a hundred feet

967
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:10,100
 of skimming across the water once you'd reached the bottom.

968
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,700
 And those were the kind of precursors before they realized,

969
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,700
 oh, let's just put water in and lose the sled.

970
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,580
 - They're very cool.

971
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,940
 - I think, yeah, they are cool.

972
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,780
 There was one of those in Coney Island as well.

973
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:23,060
 We talked about Coney Island the other week

974
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:26,380
 as one that was in Coney Island in 1895.

975
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:29,460
 But this one in the International Exhibition in 1906,

976
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,620
 it went into Lake Victoria in Christchurch,

977
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,300
 was the place it ended up.

978
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:37,300
 And it was, this exhibition was so popular

979
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:42,300
 that 1,967,682 people visited it

980
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,180
 at a time when the whole population of New Zealand

981
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:48,020
 was 975,000.

982
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:51,660
 So more than twice as many people went to this

983
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,860
 as lived in the whole country.

984
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,700
 And then this slide got bought out

985
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,660
 and got taken to Wellington.

986
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,060
 And they had it there for a few years

987
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,740
 and eventually it got taken down.

988
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,940
 But the position where it was in Wellington

989
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:05,540
 is where Peter Jackson's studio is at today.

990
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,860
 - Really? - Yeah.

991
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:10,940
 - So it's seen a lot over the years that place.

992
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,900
 Was that the one which this guy called Arthur Guinness

993
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:13,740
 went down?

994
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,540
 I think there was a newspaper report from 1906

995
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,340
 and he was the Speaker of the House of Representatives

996
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,180
 at the time.

997
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,380
 And the only reason it's funny is if you Google

998
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,580
 Arthur Guinness, the Speaker of the House of Representatives

999
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,300
 of New Zealand in 1906.

1000
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,740
 And he's got a huge white wig on.

1001
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,540
 I'm not sure that he wore this

1002
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:31,060
 when he was going down the slide.

1003
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:33,180
 But his white wig was one of those really elaborate

1004
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:35,700
 waxed mustaches, huge beard.

1005
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,740
 And the newspaper report said he turned up

1006
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,940
 and the next thing all spectators knew was

1007
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:42,500
 there was a tall black hat among a lot of girls

1008
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,420
 being hauled up in the carriage.

1009
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:46,820
 And then as it shot down the slope,

1010
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:49,060
 he had his silk hat pulled over his ears

1011
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:52,180
 and a hard point of order look in his eye.

1012
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,700
 Which I'm not sure how that goes,

1013
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,980
 but as they splashed into the water, somebody shouted,

1014
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,540
 "Point of order!"

1015
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,660
 - Classic. - Funny joke.

1016
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,620
 - Great. - Yeah.

1017
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:02,220
 - Classic satire. - Yeah.

1018
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:02,980
 - That's really good.

1019
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:05,380
 - The very start of this section, dear listener,

1020
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:08,060
 you might remember, was that the longest water slide

1021
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:10,300
 is 20 times longer than the world's shortest river.

1022
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:13,380
 So I should quickly tell you about the world's shortest river.

1023
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:16,060
 And that is the Roe River.

1024
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:19,260
 But it's extremely controversial.

1025
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:22,580
 - Has it said a few out-of-date things?

1026
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:26,020
 - Has it been cancelled? - It's been cancelled.

1027
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:28,260
 This was something I read in an article

1028
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,820
 on the website "Conday Nest"

1029
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:34,540
 and it was written by Jeopardy Champion in America, Ken Jennings.

1030
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:37,580
 And it was basically the argument between two rivers

1031
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:40,180
 in America, the Roe River and the D River,

1032
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:42,140
 about which was the shortest.

1033
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,980
 So the Guinness Book of Records had always said

1034
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:46,060
 that the D River was the shortest.

1035
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:48,500
 But then one day in 1987,

1036
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,780
 there was a teacher called Mrs. Susie Nardlinger.

1037
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:54,500
 And she got her fifth grade class to measure

1038
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,780
 this little kind of water near their school

1039
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,780
 and work out how long it was.

1040
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,140
 And they realized that it was shorter

1041
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:04,580
 than this so-called world's shortest river.

1042
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,500
 But it didn't have a name,

1043
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,420
 so it couldn't be in the Guinness Book of Records.

1044
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:10,580
 And so they wrote to the US Board on geographical names

1045
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,780
 and they got them to give it a name, which was the Roe River.

1046
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,180
 And then the Guinness Book of Records

1047
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,460
 put that as the world's shortest river.

1048
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:21,500
 Now, the people who lived near the D River were furious

1049
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,020
 because they'd lost their records

1050
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:25,940
 to these bloody school kids, okay?

1051
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,580
 And this was in Lincoln City.

1052
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:30,940
 And there was the Chamber of Commerce in Lincoln City

1053
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:33,820
 said that this Roe River was nothing more

1054
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:37,540
 than a drainage ditch surveyed for a school project.

1055
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:42,180
 - One man's drainage ditch is another man's noble river.

1056
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,020
 So-

1057
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,100
 - I think that's one way of looking at it.

1058
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,580
 Mrs. Nardlinger, when she was told this,

1059
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:50,140
 said that the D River was nothing more

1060
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,660
 than an ocean water backup.

1061
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,300
 And so there was this massive argument

1062
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,660
 between these two people about which was the shortest

1063
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,420
 and whether they were even real rivers

1064
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,900
 or they were just effluent pipes

1065
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,900
 or bits of the ocean coming in or whatever.

1066
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,900
 And eventually Guinness just said,

1067
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,700
 you know what, let's not do this record anymore.

1068
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:11,420
 And so they just, if you get a Guinness Book of Records now,

1069
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,820
 it's not in there anymore.

1070
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:16,100
 - So cowardly, if they'd just stuck to their guns.

1071
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:19,060
 I mean, it was also a crazy record to have, isn't it?

1072
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:21,020
 Because they're both sides are saying to each other,

1073
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,340
 oh, yours is rubbish and tiny.

1074
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:25,580
 And yeah, that's kind of the point.

1075
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,860
 - Yes, we're not tiny enough.

1076
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,420
 - Yeah. - Exactly.

1077
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,420
 - I think I found a water slide actually

1078
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:33,380
 that would suit both you, Andy and you, Anna.

1079
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:36,020
 It's got the danger and the leisure at the same time.

1080
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:38,700
 And this is in the Bahamas.

1081
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:39,780
 And so what it is is you,

1082
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,820
 it's called the Serpent Water Slide at the Atlantis Resort.

1083
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:46,580
 And you go down and it's a normal water slide,

1084
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:49,660
 but then Andy, you come out into a sort of,

1085
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,980
 what takes about two minutes to get across,

1086
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:54,940
 leisurely bit where you're just in your rubber ring

1087
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:58,020
 and you're going very nicely to the end.

1088
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,580
 Where the danger bit comes in

1089
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:03,060
 is when you're having that leisurely bit in the slide,

1090
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:06,300
 you are in the middle of a giant aquarium

1091
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,340
 with sharks on either side of you.

1092
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,820
 - Yeah, it looks amazing.

1093
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,460
 My friend's been on that one actually,

1094
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,980
 weirdly got a tutoring job with a family.

1095
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,220
 And then after tutoring them,

1096
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:17,820
 this was years ago, I realized they were incredibly rich

1097
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:20,260
 and got taken for two weeks in the Bahamas with them

1098
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,580
 and said it was so fantastic.

1099
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,420
 - That's so funny.

1100
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,580
 I thought you were going to say

1101
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,820
 that they were tutoring in the Bahamas

1102
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,260
 and they were so incredibly rich,

1103
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,820
 they took them to a water park.

1104
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:36,220
 - I mean, we can only dream one day

1105
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,860
 we'll be able to afford a thought park.

1106
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,620
 - Right at the very top of this fact, Dan,

1107
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,620
 you said that the previous record holder

1108
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:45,380
 of the longest slide was in New Jersey.

1109
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:48,180
 It was in a place called Action Park.

1110
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,820
 And Action Park is more famous on the internet

1111
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:53,660
 for having this incredible water slide

1112
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,980
 which had a loop-the-loop at the bottom,

1113
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:59,220
 which was only open for one month in 1985.

1114
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,140
 - Mad.

1115
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,260
 - It is incredible.

1116
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,020
 Basically what happens is you go down,

1117
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,460
 you get enough speed and you fly around the loop-the-loop

1118
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,180
 and you've got enough speed that you can stay

1119
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,620
 on the edge of the loop-the-loop

1120
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,020
 and then you come out at the end.

1121
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:13,060
 The centrifugal force sort of holds you

1122
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:15,180
 to the edge of the loop-the-loop.

1123
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,740
 But the problem is if you're like Andy

1124
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,340
 and you kind of, or me I should say,

1125
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,260
 'cause I said this earlier,

1126
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,620
 you kind of put your hands on it

1127
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,580
 to slow yourself down, right?

1128
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,940
 If you did that, you don't have enough speed

1129
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,660
 to get around the loop-the-loop.

1130
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,420
 And so one thing that can happen

1131
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:30,620
 is if you get halfway and you run out of speed,

1132
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,300
 you just smack your head down

1133
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,380
 because gravity takes over.

1134
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,500
 Another thing is you could get halfway up

1135
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,860
 and then come right the way back down again

1136
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,220
 to the very, very bottom.

1137
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:42,820
 And then there's no way out of the slide

1138
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:45,140
 because you literally can't get out.

1139
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:45,980
 And so they had-

1140
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:48,300
 - Netashinsky's coming up right behind you.

1141
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,340
 - Well, you've got to send people.

1142
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,140
 You've got to send people down to shove you along.

1143
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,380
 - Well, eventually instead of that solution,

1144
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,740
 they built a hatch at the bottom to let people out

1145
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:57,580
 if they got stuck.

1146
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,820
 - So that's, I've been on one that has the same thing.

1147
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:02,140
 There's my favorite water slide I've ever been on

1148
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,140
 is in the Gold Coast.

1149
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,500
 And if you do live in Australia

1150
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,100
 and you haven't been to it, you've got to.

1151
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,300
 And it's basically that.

1152
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,140
 It's incredible.

1153
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:10,060
 I think it's a place called Wet and Wild.

1154
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,500
 And you stand up really high at the top.

1155
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,780
 So you start super high.

1156
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,500
 You're standing on a trap door.

1157
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,260
 And then, you know, they do a lot of,

1158
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:18,300
 oh, you're ready?

1159
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,940
 Oh, are we going to go yet?

1160
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:22,220
 And then the trap door suddenly vanishes.

1161
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,500
 And so you plummet down.

1162
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,700
 So you drop vertically really fast for ages.

1163
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,740
 And then you do the loop, the loop,

1164
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:29,620
 which is so awesome.

1165
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:31,180
 So a woman did get stuck in it.

1166
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,860
 'Cause I remember seeing when I was going to go on it,

1167
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:35,420
 I saw this escape hatch in this loop.

1168
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,260
 And I was like, I wonder if that's ever been used.

1169
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,380
 And there was indeed a woman who got stuck in it

1170
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,420
 a few years ago.

1171
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:42,060
 So you operate the hatch from inside

1172
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,900
 or do they have to have someone?

1173
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:44,740
 You do.

1174
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,900
 So she said, she realized she was stuck.

1175
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,300
 And she thought, my God,

1176
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,580
 it's someone going to come down after me.

1177
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,980
 I better clutch at this escape hatch with my hand

1178
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,780
 and pull yourself out.

1179
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:56,220
 Well, the one in New Jersey, anyway,

1180
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:58,140
 there was an interview on deadspin.com

1181
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:59,860
 with one of the people who worked there.

1182
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,740
 And they said that the main problem was

1183
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:03,740
 that at the very bottom of the loop, the loop,

1184
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:06,180
 a load of kind of sand and dirt and stuff

1185
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,380
 would kind of accumulate.

1186
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:08,820
 And they won't be able to get rid of it.

1187
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,060
 And so as you went down,

1188
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:11,420
 as soon as you got to the bottom of the loop,

1189
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:14,420
 the loop, it would just drag against your back

1190
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:16,940
 and just basically take all the skin off the bottom

1191
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:19,420
 of your back before you came out.

1192
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:21,340
 So that's why it's not there anymore.

1193
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:22,180
 Jesus.

1194
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:25,260
 They are painful.

1195
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:26,500
 It's worth it because they're great,

1196
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,300
 but almost all good water slides,

1197
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:31,060
 you end up with some serious, crazy things, don't you?

1198
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:32,220
 Not that painful.

1199
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:34,980
 Not to the end without your back.

1200
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:37,560
 (upbeat music)

1201
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:43,660
 Okay, it is time for fact number four.

1202
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:44,940
 And that is my fact.

1203
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:48,700
 My fact this week is that scientists in the South Pole

1204
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:51,620
 are starting to speak with an Antarctic accent.

1205
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:57,500
 This is an interesting thing that was studied

1206
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:00,540
 by the University of Munich.

1207
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:03,780
 And the idea was they wanted to see what effect

1208
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:06,860
 being isolated in a place like Antarctica

1209
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:09,660
 would have on a communal accent.

1210
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:13,340
 And the scientists at this university decided

1211
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:14,900
 that they were gonna do a case study

1212
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:17,740
 where they took 11 members of the bases there.

1213
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:19,500
 And they got them to sit down

1214
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:22,260
 and say 28 different words into a recorder

1215
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:23,860
 before their departure.

1216
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:25,220
 And these-- - Into a recorder.

1217
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:27,140
 Is this the same recorder that was up that nose?

1218
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:30,180
 (all laughing)

1219
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:32,180
 - Yeah, sorry, they were recording their voices.

1220
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:34,660
 Yeah, there was eight Brits, it was one American,

1221
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:37,340
 it was a German and someone from Iceland.

1222
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:40,300
 And then every six weeks for their entire stay,

1223
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:43,260
 they would get them to do a further recording

1224
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:45,140
 of the same 28 words.

1225
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,420
 And they noticed as they were going along

1226
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:50,300
 that their accents were all converging

1227
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:52,380
 towards the same vowel sounds.

1228
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:55,700
 For example, if they came in saying food,

1229
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:58,180
 they all started saying food.

1230
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:00,060
 Now, that doesn't sound too different.

1231
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:03,420
 It's very tiny, but what it is is the back of the throat

1232
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:06,660
 is being used for the first food that I'm saying there, food.

1233
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:09,420
 And then food is the front of my mouth using it.

1234
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:13,060
 And they all merged to this one same vowel sound.

1235
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:15,580
 Now, it's a very small study and there's a great video,

1236
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:16,900
 by the way, to watch about it

1237
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:19,500
 on the Hafer's Interesting website on YouTube.

1238
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,980
 Do check it out, it's a real proper explanation of it.

1239
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:23,700
 And they show you all the sounds.

1240
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:26,140
 But they noticed that an Antarctic accent

1241
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:28,020
 was emerging as a result.

1242
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:28,860
 - That's very cool.

1243
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:31,060
 - But such a shame that they didn't do what I definitely

1244
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:32,700
 would have done and said,

1245
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,460
 should we just really screw with these guys

1246
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:37,540
 and turn up six weeks later going food.

1247
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:39,780
 And I just, wow.

1248
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:42,260
 - Is it very cool or is it very cool?

1249
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:43,100
 Or is it very cool?

1250
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:44,620
 (laughing)

1251
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:46,340
 - Cue.

1252
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:48,140
 Yes, vowel fronting.

1253
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:50,620
 That does seem to be what happens to the sounds

1254
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:52,460
 that we make over time.

1255
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:54,580
 And there's this thing called goose fronting.

1256
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:56,380
 Did you guys, have you read about this?

1257
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:57,220
 - I know.

1258
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:58,700
 - It's this really cool linguistic thing

1259
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:01,380
 that was defined in 1983.

1260
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:06,020
 And it basically uses goose as the example word.

1261
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:07,540
 So exactly as Dan says,

1262
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:11,980
 we tend to start with words that have our tongue high up

1263
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:14,100
 and closer to the back of our mouth.

1264
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:15,740
 And it makes a more rounded sound.

1265
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:18,420
 And over time, the tongue comes forward

1266
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:20,140
 and it makes a slightly more,

1267
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:21,780
 sort of sounds a bit more nasal sound.

1268
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:26,460
 So goose used to be said in a more sonorous rounded way.

1269
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:28,140
 And it's increasingly being said,

1270
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:31,780
 like goose, goose, goose.

1271
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:33,900
 In some places it's almost indistinguishable

1272
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,580
 from geese apparently.

1273
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:36,420
 - Geese.

1274
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:37,620
 - And then we don't know why this is happening.

1275
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:39,660
 It's happening all around the world, goose fronting.

1276
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:43,660
 - Apparently, especially in southern British English, I read.

1277
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:44,500
 - Yes.

1278
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:47,140
 - I never noticed that you guys said the word goose

1279
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:48,860
 different than the way I say the word goose.

1280
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:49,700
 - Geese.

1281
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:53,060
 - But goose, how often have you heard us say goose though?

1282
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,900
 It's rare for me to say goose.

1283
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:57,900
 - I can imagine the queen would say goose, goose.

1284
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:58,740
 - Geese.

1285
00:46:58,740 --> 00:46:59,580
 - Geese.

1286
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:00,420
 - Geese.

1287
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:01,260
 - Goose.

1288
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:02,100
 - Geese.

1289
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,980
 - Get that goose off my swab.

1290
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:06,740
 (laughing)

1291
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,660
 - There was another aspect of this Antarctic study,

1292
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:11,540
 which is, I mean, this is again in the runs of theory now,

1293
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:15,980
 but it was a theory that people might develop accents faster

1294
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:19,900
 if survival is more uncertain or more at risk.

1295
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:23,020
 So it helps if you can understand

1296
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:25,860
 what people are saying bluntly.

1297
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:28,300
 And it might accelerate the process

1298
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:29,820
 if there is more life and death situations.

1299
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:30,660
 - Really?

1300
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:31,500
 - Allegedly.

1301
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:32,980
 - I mean, over a long period of time though,

1302
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:36,020
 it's not like if you get stuck in a, you know, water slide,

1303
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,700
 you're not going to suddenly start talking

1304
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:40,260
 with a Geordie accent or something, it's like.

1305
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:42,420
 - We want to help, but we can't understand you anymore.

1306
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:43,620
 You've been in there so long.

1307
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:46,940
 - If you're in, if I went to a water park in Newcastle

1308
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:50,900
 and I was stuck in there, I might, in my panic, try.

1309
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:54,220
 - So I think that might make it much less likely

1310
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:55,660
 that you're rescued, don't you?

1311
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:57,580
 (laughing)

1312
00:47:57,580 --> 00:48:00,340
 Or can you like, add that deck, let me out of here,

1313
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:01,180
 let me get me.

1314
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:04,660
 - Who's this dickhead?

1315
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:05,500
 Leave him in there.

1316
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:07,860
 (laughing)

1317
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:08,700
 That is cool.

1318
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:10,500
 So the idea is that these scientists in the Antarctic,

1319
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:12,740
 if one of them wakes up and is unintelligible to the others,

1320
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:14,900
 then they won't be able to survive.

1321
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:15,740
 So they will-

1322
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:16,580
 - We've run out of food.

1323
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:17,420
 What's he saying?

1324
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:19,380
 Food, we've run out of food.

1325
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:22,260
 Don't get it, mate, we've run out of what?

1326
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:24,300
 - And there was this, one of these linguists

1327
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:27,100
 was Jonathan Harrington from the University of Munich.

1328
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:28,540
 And he said specifically,

1329
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:31,900
 it might be if people go to Mars, for instance,

1330
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:34,100
 and you have a group of people who have all gone to Mars,

1331
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:35,700
 that by the time they come back

1332
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:36,900
 or that we can talk to them,

1333
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:39,260
 they might all have a different Mars accent.

1334
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:41,420
 - So cool, such a cool idea.

1335
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:42,900
 - Yeah, that's completely useless.

1336
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:44,060
 Imagine if they go to Mars,

1337
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:46,220
 gather all this vital scientific data,

1338
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:47,780
 bring it back and we've got no idea

1339
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:49,100
 what they're trying to tell us.

1340
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:51,860
 (laughing)

1341
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:54,900
 - There is a thing where you,

1342
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:57,460
 basically the longer that the queen is around,

1343
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:59,420
 the more you speak like the queen.

1344
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:02,460
 If you are a naked mole rat,

1345
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:08,380
 is a recent study where they looked at colonies

1346
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:11,460
 of naked mole rats and naked mole rats, they're mammals,

1347
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:13,820
 but they act a bit like bees and ants and stuff.

1348
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:16,340
 And they have a queen who's in charge of all the mating

1349
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:18,600
 and then all the workers and stuff like that.

1350
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:21,220
 But they found that the dialects

1351
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:22,680
 of all these naked mole rats,

1352
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:24,260
 all the little chirps and stuff they make

1353
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:26,540
 are very similar to what the queen makes.

1354
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:28,780
 And then as soon as the queen dies,

1355
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:30,500
 everyone sort of goes crazy

1356
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:33,220
 and does all sorts of weird accents and stuff like that.

1357
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,860
 And then when they get a new queen,

1358
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:36,700
 they all sort of go back towards

1359
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:40,340
 whatever that new queen's accent is like.

1360
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:41,180
 Isn't that cool?

1361
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:44,220
 So we'd all be kind of like walking around to London going,

1362
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:45,060
 how do you do?

1363
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:45,900
 How do you do?

1364
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:46,740
 How do you do?

1365
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:48,580
 And then as soon as, you know,

1366
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:50,820
 hopefully very long in the future, the queen dies,

1367
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:54,100
 then I'll be going, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1368
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:54,940
 - It's falling.

1369
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:56,780
 - Hunts and trees, oh, that, yes.

1370
00:49:56,780 --> 00:50:00,140
 Monstrous carbuncle, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1371
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:01,740
 - Well, if you were a naked mole rat then,

1372
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:03,500
 then that would be the perfect moment

1373
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:08,140
 to infiltrate the pack of another group of naked mole rats

1374
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:11,580
 because accents are incredibly important to them

1375
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:14,080
 to the point where if you have a different accent,

1376
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,580
 let's say you've got 300 members

1377
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:18,380
 of a single colony of mole rats,

1378
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:20,180
 naked mole rats living with each other.

1379
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:23,620
 And a random mole rat from a different colony

1380
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:25,060
 comes in and wants to hang out.

1381
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:27,060
 They hear its chirping accent.

1382
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:30,020
 And if it's different, they'll kill it.

1383
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:31,020
 They'll just kill it.

1384
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:31,860
 - Wow.

1385
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:35,700
 - Their accents absolutely define who they are as a group.

1386
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:38,220
 And that's been studied quite a lot recently

1387
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:40,380
 because there are other animals that speak with accents,

1388
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:42,460
 but usually they're either water-based

1389
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:44,420
 or they're constantly moving around like primates.

1390
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:46,400
 And it's really hard to track and really study,

1391
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,100
 but they have been studying naked mole rats.

1392
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:50,740
 And yeah, they are just vicious.

1393
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:52,660
 - They also do that in Newcastle, Andy, by the way,

1394
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:55,380
 just when we're touring there later this year.

1395
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:56,780
 Just make sure wherever you go,

1396
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:58,660
 you always do your Geordie accent.

1397
00:50:58,660 --> 00:50:59,860
 - You won't be able to tell me

1398
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:03,780
 from born and bred Geordie by the time we get there.

1399
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:04,780
 It'll be amazing.

1400
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:06,540
 Oh, here's a weird thing.

1401
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:10,700
 Okay, so if I say to you,

1402
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:13,700
 Ants don't sleep in a French accent.

1403
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:15,860
 - Oh, is that one, that was that French?

1404
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:16,900
 - That was French, yeah.

1405
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:18,060
 - Can you do it again?

1406
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:19,620
 - Ants don't sleep.

1407
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:20,620
 - I got it, yeah.

1408
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:21,460
 - In a French accent.

1409
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:22,620
 It's so clearly a French accent.

1410
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:23,460
 I can't believe you need it.

1411
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:24,620
 Yeah, unbelievable.

1412
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:30,260
 Do you believe me when I say that, that ants don't sleep?

1413
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:32,980
 - Ants don't sleep.

1414
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:33,820
 - Okay.

1415
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:36,220
 - I know, but only because we did it on the podcast.

1416
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:38,420
 They work 24.

1417
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:39,900
 I know that's not the point you're trying to make right now,

1418
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:40,740
 but yeah.

1419
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:42,620
 - Some of them might sleep, I guess.

1420
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:43,860
 If some of them work 24 hours,

1421
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:45,300
 but other ones might sleep.

1422
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:46,780
 - Oh yeah, there might be species.

1423
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:47,620
 - I believe you.

1424
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:49,340
 Perhaps it's because we've been working together

1425
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,180
 for 10 years.

1426
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:51,420
 (laughing)

1427
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:53,820
 - So, the accent is relevant here,

1428
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:56,100
 'cause there was a study by a couple of psychologists

1429
00:51:56,100 --> 00:52:00,380
 about whether people trust more or less information

1430
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:01,660
 that they hear in a foreign accent,

1431
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,220
 or in their own native accent.

1432
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:05,180
 And rather depressingly,

1433
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:07,980
 people trust factual statements less

1434
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:09,300
 if they hear them in a foreign accent.

1435
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:10,220
 - Oh, interesting.

1436
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:12,500
 So does that mean people who listen to this podcast

1437
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:16,180
 who aren't in the UK are gonna less believe our facts

1438
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:18,220
 than people in the UK or not?

1439
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:19,700
 - Americans just think we're a podcast

1440
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:21,060
 of like, made up, imaginative.

1441
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:22,700
 (laughing)

1442
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:24,900
 - And does it also mean that people in the North

1443
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:27,140
 trust me better than they trust the rest of you?

1444
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:28,180
 - Maybe, yeah.

1445
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:30,020
 - People and no one trusts Dan.

1446
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:30,860
 Is that?

1447
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:33,900
 - I've got this, and it's hardly rightfully so.

1448
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,220
 (laughing)

1449
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:38,100
 It's a very rare case where they're totally justified.

1450
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:38,940
 - Wow.

1451
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:42,100
 - We actually had the naked mole rat thing

1452
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:46,020
 for a while in English society, the death by accident thing.

1453
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:48,060
 So in the 14th century,

1454
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:51,180
 you could be asked how you pronounced bread and cheese

1455
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:53,580
 and beheaded if you did it wrong.

1456
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:56,420
 Specifically, if you said it with a Flemish accent.

1457
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:58,460
 So, and bizarrely then,

1458
00:52:58,460 --> 00:52:59,540
 so that was 14th century.

1459
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:02,620
 And then in the 16th century in Friesland,

1460
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:04,180
 anyone who pronounced bread and cheese

1461
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:06,420
 with a French accent was beheaded.

1462
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:11,340
 And this is all about people being kind of racist back then.

1463
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:12,700
 Still, 'twas ever thus.

1464
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:14,540
 And this was in the 14th century

1465
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:16,820
 when the peasants revolt and the Flemish were associated

1466
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:18,900
 with being sort of merchants.

1467
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:20,620
 And they came from that part of the world

1468
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:21,780
 that was doing quite well

1469
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:23,780
 and the peasants weren't doing well.

1470
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:25,820
 And so these mobs were got someone to say,

1471
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:27,220
 "Say bread and cheese."

1472
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:29,740
 And if they heard a hint of Flemish,

1473
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:34,740
 so a hint of like, I think it's brought and cause,

1474
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:38,420
 who knows how they were said 700 years ago,

1475
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:40,580
 then you got your head off.

1476
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:42,980
 - Wow, and that's a shibboleth, right?

1477
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:46,180
 - Exactly, yeah, yeah, it's like a shibboleth.

1478
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:48,380
 Shibboleth, shit, I'm having beheaded.

1479
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:51,860
 - There was a thing you were saying before, Andy,

1480
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:54,780
 about how you have to change an accent

1481
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:56,700
 in order for people to understand

1482
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:58,140
 for important moments, right?

1483
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:00,860
 It's not the same scenario, but in the business world,

1484
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:02,260
 a lot of companies have been called out

1485
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:03,620
 because they've been doing things

1486
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:06,820
 that are called accent neutralization classes.

1487
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:10,380
 And particularly in America and Tennessee at a nuclear lab,

1488
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,340
 there was a course which was effectively

1489
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:14,060
 a Southern accent reduction

1490
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:16,980
 where they got all of the most Southern sounding employees

1491
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:18,540
 together and said, "We're gonna teach you

1492
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:21,980
 to soften your accent so that people can understand you."

1493
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:23,780
 - I reckon if I was at a nuclear lab

1494
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:26,540
 and anyone called it nuclear,

1495
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:27,580
 that's what people say, isn't it?

1496
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:29,180
 Nuclear instead of nuclear,

1497
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:31,340
 I think I just wouldn't do what they said.

1498
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:35,180
 So they said, "Oh my God, the nuclear reactor

1499
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:37,780
 is about to blow, you need to turn this down."

1500
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:39,380
 I'd be like, "Sorry, what reactor?"

1501
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:41,100
 (all laughing)

1502
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:42,180
 - Handing them a pamphlet

1503
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:44,580
 to the accent neutralization classes.

1504
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:46,860
 (all laughing)

1505
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:49,620
 - Do you know the language that is most similar

1506
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,740
 genetically to English?

1507
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:53,540
 This is kind of, we'll come back to accents.

1508
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:54,740
 This will weave back around.

1509
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:58,460
 - I would have said like German or Dutch maybe.

1510
00:54:58,460 --> 00:54:59,700
 - That's pretty close.

1511
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:01,300
 This is Frisian.

1512
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:05,780
 So this is, is the closest language to old English,

1513
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:06,620
 we believe.

1514
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:08,060
 So basically it's genetically close

1515
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:11,260
 'cause we're mostly descended from Frisian.

1516
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:14,500
 And it's so Frisian is from like north of the Netherlands.

1517
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:17,420
 And one of the really cool things about it

1518
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:19,380
 is that if you take an English sentence,

1519
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:22,020
 which is very full of old English words,

1520
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:24,580
 so you don't have all of that poncy romance language stuff

1521
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:26,340
 that came in with the French,

1522
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:28,820
 then it suddenly can sound really similar

1523
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:30,420
 to this quite obscure language.

1524
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:34,340
 So bread, butter and green cheese is good English

1525
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:37,980
 and good Frisian is a sentence in English.

1526
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:41,940
 And in Frisian, I can't say it very well,

1527
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:46,620
 but in Frisian it is bread, butter and green cheese

1528
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:50,620
 is good Ingelsk and good Frisian.

1529
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:53,020
 And sorry, if you're a Frisian speaker.

1530
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:54,580
 - I mean, Anna, that just sounded like you

1531
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:56,420
 after you've had a few drinks.

1532
00:55:56,420 --> 00:56:01,380
 - I make so much sense to the Dutch though.

1533
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:05,340
 - Okay, that's it.

1534
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:06,380
 That is all of our facts.

1535
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:07,980

1555
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:38,580
 Goodbye.

1556
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:41,160
 (upbeat music)

1557
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:53,300
 - I've just realized that I had one other thing.

1558
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:54,820
 Ants do sleep.

1559
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:56,620
 Sorry, I should have mentioned it.

1560
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:57,460
 Should I mention it?

1561
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:58,300
 - I don't believe you.

1562
00:56:58,300 --> 00:56:59,140
 I do not believe you.

1563
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:01,380
 (laughing)

1564
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:03,960
 (upbeat music)

1565
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:06,540
 (upbeat music)

1566
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:09,120
 (upbeat music)

1567
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:11,700
 (upbeat music)
