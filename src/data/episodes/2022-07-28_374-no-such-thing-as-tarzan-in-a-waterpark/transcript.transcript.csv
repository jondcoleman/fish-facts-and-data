00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:16,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:16,00:00:18,"of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:18,00:00:20,a weekly podcast coming to you
00:00:20,00:00:23,from four undisclosed locations in the UK.
00:00:23,00:00:24,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:24,00:00:26,"I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,"
00:00:26,00:00:29,Andrew Hunton Murray and James Harkin.
00:00:29,00:00:31,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:31,00:00:34,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:34,00:00:37,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:37,00:00:39,"Starting with you, Andy."
00:00:39,00:00:41,- My fact is that the founder of the UK's
00:00:41,00:00:43,first electric vehicle forecourt
00:00:43,00:00:45,was named after a service station.
00:00:45,00:00:48,- Which service station?
00:00:48,00:00:49,- This is a man.
00:00:49,00:00:50,- Was he named TB?
00:00:50,00:00:53,"- He wasn't, he was named Toddington."
00:00:53,00:00:55,- A classic.
00:00:55,00:00:57,- Kind of like Paddington Bear actually
00:00:57,00:00:58,"being named after Paddington Station,"
00:00:58,00:00:59,but he's Toddington.
00:00:59,00:01:00,- Was he founded that service station
00:01:00,00:01:03,like Paddington Bear was found in?
00:01:03,00:01:05,"- Yeah, he came from South America"
00:01:05,00:01:08,"with a jar of marmalade and no, he wasn't."
00:01:08,00:01:10,It's a really weird story.
00:01:10,00:01:12,So he's a guy called Toddington Harper
00:01:12,00:01:17,and he is named after the M1 Toddington Services.
00:01:17,00:01:23,"He is actually, I believe the child of some solar pioneers."
00:01:23,00:01:24,His parents were involved in solar electricity
00:01:24,00:01:26,when they were younger.
00:01:26,00:01:29,And he actually has a brother
00:01:29,00:01:31,who is named Heston after Heston services.
00:01:31,00:01:35,So both boys in this family are named after service stations.
00:01:35,00:01:36,- That's amazing.
00:01:36,00:01:38,"- His mum just said, his mum was interviewed."
00:01:38,00:01:39,There was this piece in the mail
00:01:39,00:01:42,about this electric forecourt service station thing.
00:01:42,00:01:44,And his mum said they were driving back from the hospital.
00:01:44,00:01:45,They didn't have a name for him
00:01:45,00:01:46,and they drove through Heston services.
00:01:46,00:01:47,This was with their first boy
00:01:47,00:01:49,and they thought Heston's the name.
00:01:49,00:01:51,"And then a few years later, they carried it on."
00:01:51,00:01:53,- They were on Home Trudes on Radio 4 talking about this.
00:01:53,00:01:56,And they said that they were driving down the M4
00:01:56,00:01:58,and they just started reading out the names of places
00:01:58,00:02:02,they passed to see if any of these would be a decent name.
00:02:02,00:02:07,"So they read out Roe Hampton, Putney, Siemens, Honeywell."
00:02:07,00:02:09,"That was the Heston, that was the first one."
00:02:09,00:02:11,"- So did Toddington get his,"
00:02:11,00:02:12,because that was just a theme
00:02:12,00:02:14,or was that a different route they took home
00:02:14,00:02:15,after that hospital?
00:02:15,00:02:19,- So what happened was they called the first one Heston
00:02:19,00:02:23,and that is the first service station on the M4.
00:02:23,00:02:24,"And according to the mother,"
00:02:24,00:02:26,"she said a friend of mine said,"
00:02:26,00:02:27,"""If you've called your first son"
00:02:27,00:02:29,"""after the first service station on the M4,"
00:02:29,00:02:31,"""how about calling your second son"
00:02:31,00:02:34,"""after the first service station on the M1?"""
00:02:34,00:02:35,"Right, so that's what she said."
00:02:35,00:02:38,But Toddington isn't the first service station on the M1.
00:02:38,00:02:41,The first service station on the M1 is London Gateway.
00:02:41,00:02:45,"So he should have been called London Gateway, I thought."
00:02:45,00:02:48,But London Gateway is a new name for this service station.
00:02:48,00:02:51,It's only been called that since 2000.
00:02:51,00:02:53,And really he should have been called Scratchwood.
00:02:53,00:02:54,- Nice.
00:02:54,00:02:55,- I think--
00:02:55,00:02:57,- That's the first service station historically
00:02:57,00:02:59,or the first one that you reached geographically.
00:02:59,00:03:01,- It's the first one as you leave London
00:03:01,00:03:04,going north bound for the M1 or west bound for the M4.
00:03:04,00:03:05,- Right.
00:03:05,00:03:07,The first historically is between two.
00:03:07,00:03:08,"I think you'd have to be called Watford Gap,"
00:03:08,00:03:12,"which isn't great, or Newport Pagnell,"
00:03:12,00:03:15,"which is quite a cool name, actually, would have been."
00:03:15,00:03:17,And there's this amazing website
00:03:17,00:03:20,called MotorwayServicesOnline.co.uk.
00:03:20,00:03:22,I really think we should start doing a series
00:03:22,00:03:26,of insanely good websites about really arcade subjects.
00:03:26,00:03:28,- Like ThatchInfo.com.
00:03:28,00:03:29,- Exactly.
00:03:29,00:03:31,The person who made this site has to get together
00:03:31,00:03:32,with the person who made that one.
00:03:32,00:03:34,So they go very deep into the debate
00:03:34,00:03:35,over whether Newport Pagnell
00:03:35,00:03:37,or Watford Gap are the first service station.
00:03:37,00:03:38,It is Newport Pagnell.
00:03:38,00:03:42,It beat Watford Gap by about two weeks in 1960.
00:03:42,00:03:45,But it's got some other great stuff on it.
00:03:45,00:03:48,It has a whole page on the Lou of the Year Award
00:03:48,00:03:51,because the Lou of the Year Award has a section
00:03:51,00:03:53,about service stations.
00:03:53,00:03:56,"And very sadly, it used to cover three"
00:03:56,00:03:57,"for England, Scotland, and Wales,"
00:03:57,00:04:00,but they've had to scale back the awards.
00:04:00,00:04:02,- Are you talking about the Four Court Trader Awards
00:04:02,00:04:04,because they have a Four Court Lou of the Year category?
00:04:04,00:04:06,This is an award ceremony just for Four Courts
00:04:06,00:04:07,and service stations and things.
00:04:07,00:04:10,"- That's a completely different awards ceremony, Andy."
00:04:10,00:04:12,"It's a very common confusion, though."
00:04:12,00:04:14,"Go on, but presumably you want to talk about them,"
00:04:14,00:04:17,"which is relatively unrelated, to be honest, but go on."
00:04:17,00:04:19,"- Okay, well, they've got Best Four Court Lou of the Year"
00:04:19,00:04:21,"as a category, and they've also got Best Coffee"
00:04:21,00:04:24,"and Hot Beverages Outlet, and Best Car Care"
00:04:24,00:04:26,and Lubricants Outlet as a--
00:04:26,00:04:27,"- Wow, Best Lubricants."
00:04:27,00:04:28,"- Is it car lubricants as well, though?"
00:04:28,00:04:31,It's just car care and then general lubrication.
00:04:31,00:04:32,- It must be car lubricants.
00:04:32,00:04:35,"Otherwise, that is a very specialist award."
00:04:35,00:04:39,There's an author called David Lawrence.
00:04:39,00:04:41,I don't know if he's got anything to do with that website
00:04:41,00:04:42,"that you were talking about, Anna,"
00:04:42,00:04:46,but he is pretty much the UK expert on service stations.
00:04:46,00:04:48,He's written a couple of books about them.
00:04:48,00:04:49,And there was an interview with him
00:04:49,00:04:53,"where he said that he's racked up 11,000 miles"
00:04:53,00:04:56,of motorway driving and eating breakfast
00:04:56,00:04:59,in over 100 service stations for his research.
00:04:59,00:05:01,And he said that he once spent Christmas
00:05:01,00:05:04,in a travel lodge in a service station.
00:05:04,00:05:06,"And they asked him what that was like,"
00:05:06,00:05:07,and he said it was a mixture of being
00:05:07,00:05:09,in the midst of everyone's Christmas travels
00:05:09,00:05:12,and also very alone.
00:05:12,00:05:15,"- Oh, but worth it for the fame and glory"
00:05:15,00:05:16,that he's subsequently got.
00:05:16,00:05:19,- He said that he once stayed in a service station
00:05:19,00:05:20,"in a motel in the UK,"
00:05:20,00:05:22,and the bed hadn't been changed
00:05:22,00:05:26,since the previous occupants had celebrated the wedding night.
00:05:26,00:05:28,And it still had confetti in the bed.
00:05:28,00:05:31,"And goodness knows what else, probably lubricants."
00:05:31,00:05:35,"- Actually, the travel lodge in Toddington's,"
00:05:35,00:05:39,so the service station that this guy is named after
00:05:39,00:05:40,"used to do this good thing,"
00:05:40,00:05:42,"which I think all service stationers should,"
00:05:42,00:05:43,where they had a power nap scheme.
00:05:43,00:05:45,"This is actually according to Alex Horn,"
00:05:45,00:05:47,who wrote this big article on service stations
00:05:47,00:05:48,"'cause he loves them,"
00:05:48,00:05:50,but you could rent a room for three hours.
00:05:50,00:05:53,"And I don't know why that's not absolutely standard, right?"
00:05:53,00:05:54,"When you get to a service station,"
00:05:54,00:05:57,so often you just have a half hour nap in your car.
00:05:57,00:05:58,- I think people don't like to do that
00:05:58,00:06:03,because it might encourage like what in Japan
00:06:03,00:06:05,you call love hotels where people just rent by the hour
00:06:05,00:06:06,and go to check.
00:06:06,00:06:08,"- Yes, I think that makes sense."
00:06:08,00:06:10,- Was that Alex Horn from Taskmaster?
00:06:10,00:06:14,"- Yes, he does a second string on his bow."
00:06:14,00:06:16,"- He loves him, he loves him."
00:06:16,00:06:19,"Actually, I found, I contacted him last night"
00:06:19,00:06:20,"'cause I read that article too,"
00:06:20,00:06:23,and he was talking about one particularly great service station
00:06:23,00:06:25,"called Clacket Lane, it's in Clacket Lane."
00:06:25,00:06:29,"And he was saying that as well as fun things they have there,"
00:06:29,00:06:31,like they've got Roman pottery
00:06:31,00:06:32,"that was found at the site on display,"
00:06:32,00:06:34,"so you can see that while you're there,"
00:06:34,00:06:37,but they've also got a palm reading machine.
00:06:37,00:06:39,This is kind of like Zoltar.
00:06:39,00:06:41,"You put your palm into the machine,"
00:06:41,00:06:42,"you're handed to the machine,"
00:06:42,00:06:44,and it tells you your future.
00:06:44,00:06:45,And you get this little ticket
00:06:45,00:06:47,that tells you what your future's gonna be.
00:06:47,00:06:49,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:06:49,00:06:51,"Interestingly, Clacket Lane as well,"
00:06:51,00:06:55,"supposedly is the best place on the M25 to hitchhike,"
00:06:55,00:06:57,"and that's according to Hitchwiki,"
00:06:57,00:07:00,"which I'd never heard of, another fantastic website."
00:07:00,00:07:02,"- Dan, were you googling how to get picked up"
00:07:02,00:07:03,at most of the servers?
00:07:03,00:07:04,(laughing)
00:07:04,00:07:06,And you still want to go on Hitchwiki.
00:07:06,00:07:08,(laughing)
00:07:08,00:07:09,- Anyone fancy a power nap?
00:07:09,00:07:12,- One good place where you could get picked up
00:07:12,00:07:14,at a service station was Watford Gap.
00:07:14,00:07:16,"Back in the day, when it was a place"
00:07:16,00:07:18,"where lots of bands used to go,"
00:07:18,00:07:21,"and apparently according to Francis Rossi of status quo,"
00:07:21,00:07:23,"it used to be where groupies hung out,"
00:07:23,00:07:25,because they knew that all the bands
00:07:25,00:07:26,would stop at Watford Gap
00:07:26,00:07:28,on the way to a gig or back from a gig.
00:07:28,00:07:31,And so as well as going to the backstage door
00:07:31,00:07:33,"or going to the hotels or whatever,"
00:07:33,00:07:35,they used to hang out at Watford Gap services
00:07:35,00:07:37,to see if they could pick up a rock star.
00:07:37,00:07:38,- So great.
00:07:38,00:07:41,"- That's, it feels like such a high stakes game, doesn't it?"
00:07:41,00:07:43,"'Cause you might pick up a rolling stone or something,"
00:07:43,00:07:45,or you might just spend your entire evening
00:07:45,00:07:46,at the Watford Gap service.
00:07:46,00:07:47,(laughing)
00:07:47,00:07:48,"- On your 70 McDonald's,"
00:07:48,00:07:50,all you've met is van drivers so far.
00:07:50,00:07:53,"But yeah, they all used to talk about it."
00:07:53,00:07:54,It became sort of famous.
00:07:54,00:07:56,"And Ronnie Wood of Rolling Stones fame, obviously,"
00:07:56,00:07:58,said that apparently Jimi Hendrix
00:07:58,00:08:00,thought that it was a nightclub.
00:08:00,00:08:02,So it was called the Blue Boar back then.
00:08:02,00:08:03,The cafe was called Blue Boar.
00:08:03,00:08:05,And he said Hendrix thought it was a nightclub
00:08:05,00:08:06,because all of his fellow musicians
00:08:06,00:08:08,used to go on about stopping up at the Blue Boar.
00:08:08,00:08:11,So he was so excited to finally get there
00:08:11,00:08:13,and find that it sold bad coffee.
00:08:13,00:08:16,And had a big car park.
00:08:16,00:08:18,And it doesn't even get very rated very highly
00:08:18,00:08:20,in service station awards now.
00:08:20,00:08:23,"I learned from my favorite website, sadly."
00:08:23,00:08:27,- Did you guys hear the song about the Watford Gap?
00:08:27,00:08:28,- Yes. - No.
00:08:28,00:08:30,- So this is by a folk singer called Roy Harper.
00:08:30,00:08:32,So he's a very famous folk musician
00:08:32,00:08:34,"and he, there's a Led Zeppelin song"
00:08:34,00:08:35,called Hats Off to Roy Harper.
00:08:35,00:08:37,He's a pretty big deal.
00:08:37,00:08:39,He released a song called Watford Gap
00:08:39,00:08:41,which was so rude about the Watford Gap
00:08:41,00:08:43,that its owners kind of called in the lawyers.
00:08:43,00:08:46,"And they, some people intervened"
00:08:46,00:08:47,and got it taken off the album.
00:08:47,00:08:50,So here are some of the lines from it.
00:08:50,00:08:53,"Just about a mile from where the motorways all merge,"
00:08:53,00:08:54,"you can view the national edifice,"
00:08:54,00:08:56,a monumental splurge.
00:08:56,00:08:58,It's the lonesome traveler's rock gut
00:08:58,00:08:59,or bacteria's revenge.
00:08:59,00:09:03,The great plastic spectacular descendant of Stonehenge.
00:09:03,00:09:06,The countryside is ravaged like a syphilitic whore.
00:09:06,00:09:09,Yodeling up the canyon is the dirty old Blue Boar.
00:09:09,00:09:10,And they didn't like it.
00:09:10,00:09:14,"Watford Gap, Watford Gap, it's a load of crap."
00:09:14,00:09:15,You can go there for a two hour nap
00:09:15,00:09:17,but you might get the clap.
00:09:17,00:09:18,That's what I would love for.
00:09:18,00:09:20,- That's very strong.
00:09:20,00:09:23,- The American pioneer of petrol stations
00:09:23,00:09:27,was a man whose name was Sylvarnus Freelove Bowser.
00:09:27,00:09:29,- Wow.
00:09:29,00:09:30,- That was his name.
00:09:30,00:09:32,"- The head of Nintendo is called Bowser, isn't he?"
00:09:32,00:09:34,People send us that from time to time.
00:09:34,00:09:37,"Yeah, 'cause Bowser is also a character in..."
00:09:37,00:09:39,Did he always know about Mario Kart?
00:09:39,00:09:40,"- In Mario Kart, yeah."
00:09:40,00:09:42,- So is the evil guy.
00:09:42,00:09:45,- I guess maybe some relation between Sylvarnus Freelove
00:09:45,00:09:47,"and the head of Nintendo, I don't know."
00:09:47,00:09:51,"- Well, we're also talking about with this fact"
00:09:51,00:09:52,"about electric cars, right?"
00:09:52,00:09:56,"And so just as a connection to that,"
00:09:56,00:09:59,"the Tesla, there's a lot of Easter eggs in the Tesla"
00:09:59,00:10:02,that sort of have been programmed either by Elon Musk
00:10:02,00:10:03,or the nerds from within there.
00:10:03,00:10:06,"And one of them is that while you're driving,"
00:10:06,00:10:08,if you rapidly press the autopilot button
00:10:08,00:10:12,"four times in a row, the street on your display"
00:10:12,00:10:14,will turn from the standard road
00:10:14,00:10:17,into rainbow road from Mario Kart.
00:10:17,00:10:18,(laughing)
00:10:18,00:10:20,"- Wait a minute, but in rainbow road,"
00:10:20,00:10:22,my memory says that it's very easy
00:10:22,00:10:23,"to fall off that road, isn't it?"
00:10:23,00:10:25,"- Yes, yeah."
00:10:25,00:10:26,It's the most dangerous of tracks
00:10:26,00:10:29,"in the classic Mario Kart, yeah."
00:10:29,00:10:31,- There was that thing which I was gonna do
00:10:31,00:10:33,"as a fact on this show that if you say open butthole,"
00:10:33,00:10:38,then it opens the thing that you use to charge the car up.
00:10:38,00:10:40,- Like the voice activation system.
00:10:40,00:10:40,- Is that deliberate?
00:10:40,00:10:41,That's an Easter egg.
00:10:41,00:10:44,It's not some accident 'cause it sounds like something.
00:10:44,00:10:44,(laughing)
00:10:44,00:10:45,I don't know what.
00:10:45,00:10:48,- Like bolt hole or something.
00:10:48,00:10:49,I don't know.
00:10:49,00:10:51,"- God, I don't know if I want Easter eggs in my car."
00:10:51,00:10:53,"You don't want to go, oh, maybe if you do three left turns"
00:10:53,00:10:55,"in a row, the drive will be ejected or something."
00:10:55,00:10:58,(laughing)
00:10:58,00:11:00,"- Well, here's another one."
00:11:00,00:11:04,"If you tap the corner of the top main monitor, the T,"
00:11:04,00:11:07,"if you tap it three times, it turns into a touchscreen"
00:11:07,00:11:10,and you can start drawing with a color palette.
00:11:10,00:11:12,So you can just start doing whatever drawings you want.
00:11:12,00:11:14,"You have to do it as the passenger, obviously."
00:11:14,00:11:15,This is not for the driver.
00:11:15,00:11:18,And then you submit it afterwards to Tesla
00:11:18,00:11:20,and they critique your drawing for you.
00:11:20,00:11:22,"- Wow, is that Elon Musk personally?"
00:11:22,00:11:23,Is that what he does now?
00:11:23,00:11:26,He just sits in a study critiquing people's drawings.
00:11:26,00:11:27,- It feels like that.
00:11:27,00:11:29,And he sends you 10 million doge coins
00:11:29,00:11:31,for the best one or something.
00:11:31,00:11:35,- I think the very first electric car was designed
00:11:35,00:11:39,"in 1839, so they didn't catch on at all"
00:11:39,00:11:41,and they weren't used publicly.
00:11:41,00:11:43,"But this guy called Moritz von Jacoby,"
00:11:43,00:11:44,who was a Russian engineer.
00:11:44,00:11:48,So they've been around about the same time
00:11:48,00:11:49,there was a boat that carried passengers
00:11:49,00:11:50,that was electric powered.
00:11:50,00:11:52,And he built an electric car that he exhibited
00:11:52,00:11:55,around Scotland and he just couldn't get people
00:11:55,00:11:56,interested in it.
00:11:56,00:11:59,"So people like, I don't see any use to this."
00:11:59,00:12:02,The only people who were interested were railway workers
00:12:02,00:12:04,and they were afraid it was gonna supplant the railway.
00:12:04,00:12:06,And so they smashed it up in his garage
00:12:06,00:12:09,in the middle of the night and took 40 years
00:12:09,00:12:10,before it took off again.
00:12:10,00:12:11,- Wow.
00:12:11,00:12:12,"- Yeah, rough."
00:12:12,00:12:15,- So much what might have been stuff about this.
00:12:15,00:12:17,"It's obviously so nice to imagine, you know,"
00:12:17,00:12:19,"all the cars were electric, working me off."
00:12:19,00:12:23,- And then thanks to bloody cyclists such as myself
00:12:23,00:12:25,"who claim we're so environmentally friendly these days,"
00:12:25,00:12:28,but we killed the electric car
00:12:28,00:12:31,because it was the improvement of road surfaces
00:12:31,00:12:34,in the late 19th century by kind of cyclists
00:12:34,00:12:37,"pushing for improved road surfaces so they could go touring,"
00:12:37,00:12:39,which meant that people wanted to go on longer drives.
00:12:39,00:12:41,And the one problem with electric cars back then
00:12:41,00:12:42,"was the same as now,"
00:12:42,00:12:44,which is that they didn't have very big range.
00:12:44,00:12:47,And so suddenly gasoline petrol cars took off
00:12:47,00:12:48,'cause they could drive a long way
00:12:48,00:12:50,over these newly surfaced roads.
00:12:50,00:12:52,So cyclists got a lot to answer for actually.
00:12:52,00:12:56,- But then when they did know
00:12:56,00:12:57,that they couldn't go very far
00:12:57,00:13:01,and so they aimed the electric cars directly at women.
00:13:01,00:13:05,"So in the 1910s and going into the 1920s,"
00:13:05,00:13:06,you would get these advertisements
00:13:06,00:13:09,like for the Argo company.
00:13:09,00:13:12,They advertised their electric vehicle as a woman's car
00:13:12,00:13:14,that any man is proud to drive.
00:13:14,00:13:18,And the idea was that women wouldn't want
00:13:18,00:13:19,to go on long journeys.
00:13:19,00:13:22,They would much rather kind of poodle around the city
00:13:22,00:13:23,or whatever.
00:13:23,00:13:25,And so we're more likely to buy these cars.
00:13:25,00:13:25,- More poodle.
00:13:25,00:13:27,"- That's so, that's classic women."
00:13:27,00:13:29,They hate distance.
00:13:29,00:13:30,They hate the notion of distance.
00:13:30,00:13:33,They take a brain to kind of absorb those big numbers.
00:13:33,00:13:36,Did anyone else think when James said
00:13:36,00:13:38,the only way to use electric cars was to aim them at women
00:13:38,00:13:39,that you literally were saying
00:13:39,00:13:42,you're pointing electric cars at women?
00:13:42,00:13:43,Put your foot down.
00:13:43,00:13:45,- That's another Easter egg on the Tesla.
00:13:45,00:13:48,(upbeat music)
00:13:48,00:13:55,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Anna."
00:13:55,00:13:59,"- My fact this week is that from 1975 to 2004,"
00:13:59,00:14:02,it was illegal to buy the world's most popular
00:14:02,00:14:03,collection of jazz music.
00:14:03,00:14:07,"And when I say jazz music, I mean sheet music."
00:14:07,00:14:09,So jazz music that you play.
00:14:09,00:14:12,So this is this thing called the real book.
00:14:12,00:14:15,And I learned about it on a 99% invisible episode
00:14:15,00:14:18,that I was pointed to by the browser.
00:14:18,00:14:20,So I just want to point out if there's anyone left
00:14:20,00:14:23,"in the country who hasn't discovered the browser.com,"
00:14:23,00:14:26,it's an amazing site which curates great articles for you.
00:14:26,00:14:28,"- God, I've been signed up to the bowser.com"
00:14:28,00:14:31,which has the details of people called bowser.
00:14:31,00:14:31,(laughing)
00:14:31,00:14:34,It's not coming handy for 300 episodes.
00:14:34,00:14:36,"- So okay, they don't really want your type on there."
00:14:36,00:14:38,It's sort of a highbrow thing.
00:14:38,00:14:43,"Anyway, thebrowser.com pointed me towards the real book"
00:14:43,00:14:45,which is the definitive book of jazz tunes
00:14:45,00:14:47,for anyone who wants to play jazz.
00:14:47,00:14:49,"Anyone who is a jazz musician out there,"
00:14:49,00:14:50,I'm sure will know it.
00:14:50,00:14:56,And this was made in 1974
00:14:56,00:14:59,and it was published and sold
00:14:59,00:15:01,without any kind of copyright releases
00:15:01,00:15:04,or any permissions or any royalties arranged or anything.
00:15:04,00:15:06,"It was just written out, printed off"
00:15:06,00:15:09,and then sold in sort of back alleyways
00:15:09,00:15:12,"and in people's bedrooms, student bedrooms"
00:15:12,00:15:13,and every jazz student has to have it.
00:15:13,00:15:15,And it's basically all the jazz standards
00:15:15,00:15:17,as they're called from the beginning of jazz
00:15:17,00:15:20,from the 1920s and even before that you need
00:15:20,00:15:23,if you want to entertain someone in a bar.
00:15:23,00:15:25,- It's amazing the story of how it came about as well.
00:15:25,00:15:28,It's sort of originated with the fact that radio stations
00:15:28,00:15:31,needed to work out how to pay copyrights and royalties
00:15:31,00:15:34,towards the composers of certain songs
00:15:34,00:15:35,and they had a really hard time doing it.
00:15:35,00:15:38,So they created this thing called the tune decks
00:15:38,00:15:40,and they were index cards that on one side
00:15:40,00:15:42,had the information about a particular song.
00:15:42,00:15:45,So it would have your composer's name
00:15:45,00:15:47,or any of the information that you would need for payment.
00:15:47,00:15:48,"And on the other side,"
00:15:48,00:15:50,they would have literally the sheet music
00:15:50,00:15:52,but like a section of the song
00:15:52,00:15:54,so that anyone who was playing the song
00:15:54,00:15:56,could identify it via the lyrics
00:15:56,00:15:59,or by literally the notes on the staves.
00:15:59,00:16:00,"- And when you say playing, you mean like"
00:16:00,00:16:02,"if you're a radio DJ, anyone who's putting the song on."
00:16:02,00:16:03,"So it's like, you'll hear the song"
00:16:03,00:16:05,and then you can skim through these cards
00:16:05,00:16:07,"and be like, oh yeah, that looks like the tune."
00:16:07,00:16:08,"So I can say, this is Blah-dee-blah"
00:16:08,00:16:10,"by so-and-so, probably."
00:16:10,00:16:12,- Does that mean a DJ would have to be able
00:16:12,00:16:14,to read music to even-
00:16:14,00:16:15,- That's what it sounded like.
00:16:15,00:16:16,- Yeah.
00:16:16,00:16:16,- It does sound like that.
00:16:16,00:16:19,And so one of the reasons that they became quite popular
00:16:19,00:16:23,was because musicians found them really useful
00:16:23,00:16:24,for when they were going to gigs
00:16:24,00:16:27,to be able to use them basically as cheat sheets
00:16:27,00:16:28,so that they could look at it
00:16:28,00:16:30,and fake their way through a popular song
00:16:30,00:16:32,that they didn't necessarily know.
00:16:32,00:16:34,"And because it's jazz and free-flowing,"
00:16:34,00:16:35,you can venture off the main theme
00:16:35,00:16:37,but it's the essence of it.
00:16:37,00:16:38,- It gives you the basics
00:16:38,00:16:40,"and then from there, you can kind of fake it."
00:16:40,00:16:41,- Yes.
00:16:41,00:16:44,- It gives you the chords and the kind of melody
00:16:44,00:16:45,and the lyrics.
00:16:45,00:16:47,"And as Dan says, you just riff off the back of that"
00:16:47,00:16:48,which you do anyway.
00:16:48,00:16:49,- Cool.
00:16:49,00:16:52,- And then you said that it was legal in 2004
00:16:52,00:16:55,and that's because a company made a legal version
00:16:55,00:16:57,where they got all the copyrights from people
00:16:57,00:16:58,"and stuff like that, right?"
00:16:58,00:16:59,- Yes.
00:16:59,00:17:01,And lots of other publishers tried to publish
00:17:01,00:17:02,actual books of jazz tunes
00:17:02,00:17:06,"but this because it had evolved over 50, 60, 70 years,"
00:17:06,00:17:07,nothing could compete.
00:17:07,00:17:08,"So yeah, I think in the end,"
00:17:08,00:17:10,"it was Hal Leonard music publishers, wasn't it?"
00:17:10,00:17:11,Who got all the rights to all the songs
00:17:11,00:17:13,which must have been held.
00:17:13,00:17:13,- Yeah.
00:17:13,00:17:15,I think the reason other publishers couldn't compete
00:17:15,00:17:17,was that they were trying to do it legally.
00:17:17,00:17:19,(laughing)
00:17:19,00:17:20,"I asked a friend of mine,"
00:17:20,00:17:23,"my friend Will who is a jazz saxophonist,"
00:17:23,00:17:25,"I asked him, have you heard of the real book?"
00:17:25,00:17:27,"And he said, of course I have."
00:17:27,00:17:28,"And he said, there are many editions"
00:17:28,00:17:29,and I own many editions.
00:17:29,00:17:31,"And I, he said that--"
00:17:31,00:17:33,- Illegal editions Andy or the legal ones.
00:17:33,00:17:35,"- I'm not saying, I'm not dropping him in there"
00:17:35,00:17:37,although I have an active on this podcast.
00:17:37,00:17:39,"- What is it called, Will?"
00:17:39,00:17:39,"- Will, yeah."
00:17:39,00:17:40,"- All right, Will, yeah."
00:17:40,00:17:42,"- Will Gumbins, yeah, yeah."
00:17:42,00:17:44,(laughing)
00:17:44,00:17:46,"But he said that until the sixth edition,"
00:17:46,00:17:48,they didn't have quite enough of the standards for it
00:17:48,00:17:50,"to be, you know, all encompassing comprehensive."
00:17:50,00:17:52,So apparently you want the sick edition onwards
00:17:52,00:17:53,if you're in the market.
00:17:53,00:17:56,"- It's kind of hard to,"
00:17:56,00:17:58,"'cause so many tunes in the whole point of jazz, I suppose,"
00:17:58,00:18:00,or lots of the point of it is that there's lots
00:18:00,00:18:01,of improvisation.
00:18:01,00:18:03,It's kind of hard to know in the real book
00:18:03,00:18:05,which bits have come from who.
00:18:05,00:18:07,"So, you know, if someone's got a brilliant"
00:18:07,00:18:09,"do-be-do, do-be-do moment."
00:18:09,00:18:10,- Oh yeah.
00:18:10,00:18:11,- And they play that on the night.
00:18:11,00:18:12,Does that--
00:18:12,00:18:13,"- That's Miles Dovers, I think."
00:18:13,00:18:14,Isn't it unmistakable?
00:18:14,00:18:15,"- Yeah, that's right, yeah."
00:18:15,00:18:18,"You know, as in who kind of owns that"
00:18:18,00:18:19,is a really vexed question.
00:18:20,00:18:22,"They had jazz diplomacy, of course."
00:18:22,00:18:27,The idea being that America would send jazz musicians out
00:18:27,00:18:31,to countries that were threatened by communism.
00:18:31,00:18:35,And the jazz musicians would make people think
00:18:35,00:18:36,that America's a great place
00:18:36,00:18:39,'cause it has this kind of subversive music.
00:18:39,00:18:42,And this was started by a congressman called
00:18:42,00:18:44,"Adam Clayton Powell Jr.,"
00:18:44,00:18:46,who was an African-American congressman
00:18:46,00:18:48,who represented Harlem.
00:18:48,00:18:49,But it wasn't really his idea.
00:18:49,00:18:50,It was his wife's idea.
00:18:50,00:18:52,His wife was called Hazel Scott
00:18:52,00:18:55,and she was a jazz pianist.
00:18:55,00:18:56,And she was amazing.
00:18:56,00:18:59,"She was the first black American to host her own TV show,"
00:18:59,00:19:01,the Hazel Scott Show.
00:19:01,00:19:03,She would never play in a place
00:19:03,00:19:05,where there was any segregation
00:19:05,00:19:06,between black and white people.
00:19:06,00:19:09,"She would turn up and then if there was any segregation,"
00:19:09,00:19:11,she'd walk away and cause riots a lot of the time
00:19:11,00:19:12,'cause she wouldn't play.
00:19:12,00:19:14,But she was eventually brought down
00:19:14,00:19:16,because people thought she was a communist.
00:19:17,00:19:18,"- But the interesting thing,"
00:19:18,00:19:20,or another interesting thing about her
00:19:20,00:19:23,"is that her grandson, Adam C. Powell IV,"
00:19:23,00:19:26,currently runs a company that's trying to find greener ways
00:19:26,00:19:29,to find rare earth metals for electric cars.
00:19:29,00:19:32,So we've come a full circle to the electric car stuff.
00:19:32,00:19:33,- Very nice.
00:19:33,00:19:35,- This is the Powell family podcast.
00:19:35,00:19:37,(all laughing)
00:19:37,00:19:40,"- Well, there was a thing in the First World War called,"
00:19:40,00:19:43,"this was, I guess, this was not jazz diplomacy."
00:19:43,00:19:46,"In fact, it was the opposite, it was jazz war"
00:19:46,00:19:49,because there was a regiment called the Harlem Hellfighters.
00:19:49,00:19:50,That was their nickname
00:19:50,00:19:53,"and they were the 369th US infantry,"
00:19:53,00:19:55,largely recruited from Harlem.
00:19:55,00:19:58,"And so, and it had a lot of musicians in it, the regiment."
00:19:58,00:20:00,"And as they arrived in France, they played jazz"
00:20:00,00:20:02,"and people in France,"
00:20:02,00:20:04,"maybe some people in Paris had had jazz before,"
00:20:04,00:20:08,"but people in, you know, 1917 in rural France"
00:20:08,00:20:09,had not had jazz.
00:20:09,00:20:12,"And as they arrived, they played a jazz version"
00:20:12,00:20:15,of the Marseillais and it blew people's minds.
00:20:15,00:20:17,And there was a kind of mini craze
00:20:17,00:20:19,which got called ragtimeitis.
00:20:19,00:20:22,"As a result of it, people hadn't had syncopated rhythms"
00:20:22,00:20:24,before playing off the beat.
00:20:24,00:20:25,This is insane.
00:20:25,00:20:28,"- In World War II, there was also a bit of jazz war"
00:20:28,00:20:31,waged by Britain who launched a jazz radio station
00:20:31,00:20:34,"in Germany, which I had never read about."
00:20:34,00:20:36,But this was basically a surrogateous way
00:20:36,00:20:39,to poison the minds of Germans against the Nazis.
00:20:39,00:20:41,And it involves setting up a jazz station
00:20:41,00:20:44,and the announcer on it was a woman called Agnes Bernel.
00:20:44,00:20:46,She was actually a German expat.
00:20:46,00:20:49,She'd fled Nazi Germany and landed in Britain.
00:20:49,00:20:53,"And they said, can you be a DJ on a fake jazz radio station?"
00:20:53,00:20:55,"And through you, we'll get loads of secret messages out there"
00:20:55,00:20:58,to basically to plant chaos.
00:20:58,00:21:00,"For instance, she commiserated at one point"
00:21:00,00:21:04,"with a specific German U-boat captain saying,"
00:21:04,00:21:05,you must be so hard for him
00:21:05,00:21:07,'cause he hasn't been on leave for two years.
00:21:07,00:21:10,But congratulations on the birth of his son at home.
00:21:10,00:21:12,That's why I've just given birth to a son.
00:21:12,00:21:15,And this guy got one.
00:21:15,00:21:16,- So she was pregnant for over two years.
00:21:16,00:21:17,That's amazing.
00:21:17,00:21:19,- Very long gestation period.
00:21:19,00:21:21,- I've just understood the implication.
00:21:21,00:21:24,"- Wow, I'm naive."
00:21:24,00:21:27,- He was captaining a boat off the coast of Scotland
00:21:27,00:21:30,"and he went to the coast and surrendered and said,"
00:21:30,00:21:32,"saw this, my wife just shagged someone else."
00:21:32,00:21:32,I'm out.
00:21:32,00:21:34,Surrendered that boat.
00:21:34,00:21:35,So it worked.
00:21:35,00:21:38,But there was another thing that she was reminiscing about
00:21:38,00:21:39,"on the show I listened to her on,"
00:21:39,00:21:43,which was that she announced on this radio station
00:21:43,00:21:46,that Allied saboteurs in SS uniforms
00:21:46,00:21:48,had been dropped in a particular region.
00:21:48,00:21:50,"And so SS cars went all over this region,"
00:21:50,00:21:51,arresting each other.
00:21:51,00:21:54,Whenever they saw each other they arrested each other.
00:21:54,00:21:56,- That's a great idea.
00:21:56,00:22:00,- Have you guys heard of Russ and Roland Kirk?
00:22:00,00:22:01,- No.
00:22:01,00:22:05,- I think he might be my favorite jazz player ever.
00:22:05,00:22:07,"I only found him in the course of researching this,"
00:22:07,00:22:11,but he was blind from a very young age.
00:22:11,00:22:12,"And in spite of that,"
00:22:12,00:22:14,"he not only mastered saxophone,"
00:22:14,00:22:17,he managed to master playing three saxophones
00:22:17,00:22:18,at the same time.
00:22:18,00:22:20,- Hang on.
00:22:20,00:22:21,"- Okay, how much orificence is he?"
00:22:21,00:22:22,- Incredible.
00:22:22,00:22:25,"- I could imagine blowing it three on that,"
00:22:25,00:22:26,"or three on your mouth,"
00:22:26,00:22:29,"but he's not blown through his ears or his anus, is he?"
00:22:29,00:22:30,- He wasn't.
00:22:30,00:22:31,"No, he was not."
00:22:31,00:22:33,He had three saxophones around his neck
00:22:33,00:22:35,"and he could fit all three into his mouth,"
00:22:35,00:22:37,stretched out at the same time.
00:22:37,00:22:39,"- Okay, for the listeners,"
00:22:39,00:22:40,Andy was stretching his mouth out there
00:22:40,00:22:44,by putting his index fingers into the sides of his mouth
00:22:44,00:22:45,and pulling them sideways.
00:22:45,00:22:48,- Yeah.
00:22:48,00:22:49,- That can't have been a good sound.
00:22:49,00:22:50,Did it work?
00:22:50,00:22:51,- It sounds all right.
00:22:51,00:22:52,- Does it?
00:22:52,00:22:54,"- I mean, yeah, but he doesn't have enough hands."
00:22:54,00:22:55,"- Yeah, I was going to say,"
00:22:55,00:22:58,it's not just mouths that you need to play saxophone.
00:22:58,00:23:01,"- Okay, this is where it gets interesting."
00:23:01,00:23:02,He had six hands.
00:23:04,00:23:09,He uses his two hands on two sets of keys
00:23:09,00:23:11,"and lets the third saxophone go for the moment,"
00:23:11,00:23:13,but he's always shifting hands between the saxes.
00:23:13,00:23:16,It's better than I've made it sound.
00:23:16,00:23:18,And he could also play the flute with his mouth
00:23:18,00:23:20,while playing the recorder with his nose.
00:23:20,00:23:22,That he was unbelievably talented.
00:23:22,00:23:25,- That's very cool.
00:23:25,00:23:29,I did a quick search into sort of other jazz books
00:23:29,00:23:31,that are out there that we might not have heard of.
00:23:31,00:23:34,And it led me to discover a book that was published
00:23:34,00:23:38,"by one of the great American jazz musicians, Charles Mingus,"
00:23:38,00:23:41,"who I actually, I grew up listening to."
00:23:41,00:23:43,He's an extraordinary musician.
00:23:43,00:23:46,"And it turns out that after his gigs,"
00:23:46,00:23:48,he used to sell a self-published book.
00:23:48,00:23:52,"It was a sort of pamphlet, which he called a catalog,"
00:23:52,00:23:54,cat hyphen a log.
00:23:54,00:23:57,"And it was a book that was toilet training for your cat,"
00:23:57,00:23:58,which he was obsessed by.
00:23:58,00:24:02,"So he had a cat called Nightlife,"
00:24:02,00:24:05,"who he claims he took three to four weeks to train,"
00:24:05,00:24:07,to sit on a toilet.
00:24:07,00:24:11,And the whole pamphlet is his step-by-step guide
00:24:11,00:24:13,for how you can make this happen.
00:24:13,00:24:15,"And so it starts with, you've got to teach them"
00:24:15,00:24:18,"to go to a kitty litter to begin with,"
00:24:18,00:24:21,slowly inch that box towards the bathroom.
00:24:21,00:24:23,Once you've reached the bathroom
00:24:23,00:24:24,"and they feel comfortable going there,"
00:24:24,00:24:26,"put the box on top of the toilet,"
00:24:26,00:24:29,"then cut a hole in the, this is over, you know,"
00:24:29,00:24:33,"a period of wheat, cut a hole at the bottom of the cardboard,"
00:24:33,00:24:35,then gradually cut the box down.
00:24:35,00:24:37,So it's just a flat bit of paper.
00:24:37,00:24:40,"And eventually you'll find, he said,"
00:24:40,00:24:42,"""You'll be hearing in the night just flushing noises"
00:24:42,00:24:45,from the toilet as your cat has taken itself
00:24:45,00:24:46,"to the toilet."""
00:24:46,00:24:48,"- Sorry, the cat flushes it after this."
00:24:48,00:24:51,"- This is, Nightlife apparently does this."
00:24:51,00:24:53,- So is this Charlie Mingus' cat?
00:24:53,00:24:54,Charles Mingus' cat?
00:24:54,00:24:57,"Charles Mingus, as well as sustaining"
00:24:57,00:24:59,"the incredible jazz career he did,"
00:24:59,00:25:00,was house training a cat.
00:25:00,00:25:01,"It's, I can't believe that."
00:25:01,00:25:02,"- I know, it's extraordinary."
00:25:02,00:25:04,"And honestly, after gigs, this is what he would sell."
00:25:04,00:25:06,This was like his big push.
00:25:06,00:25:09,He printed ads up where he was doing mail order
00:25:09,00:25:11,so that you could buy these pamphlets.
00:25:11,00:25:13,"- So there is another jazz book, which is so weird,"
00:25:13,00:25:14,"called A Cat O'Logue,"
00:25:14,00:25:16,which this might have been in response to
00:25:16,00:25:17,'cause it was by Cab Calloway.
00:25:17,00:25:20,"In 1938, he published Cab Calloway's Cat O'Logue,"
00:25:20,00:25:22,"A Hepster's Dictionary,"
00:25:22,00:25:25,which was the first dictionary written
00:25:25,00:25:28,by an African-American and it was the Jive Language
00:25:28,00:25:29,reference book of the New York Public Library.
00:25:29,00:25:31,So if you went to the library and you wanted to know
00:25:31,00:25:33,"about Jive Talk, this is the book you'd get."
00:25:33,00:25:37,"- And the cat there is like a hep cat, I guess, right?"
00:25:37,00:25:38,"- Exactly, yeah."
00:25:38,00:25:42,So is it possible Charlie Mingus was referring
00:25:42,00:25:43,nodding to that?
00:25:43,00:25:47,"- In my reading, I didn't see any of that as a pun reference."
00:25:47,00:25:50,- Awful if you mistakenly got the wrong one.
00:25:50,00:25:51,"You'll never train that cat,"
00:25:51,00:25:53,but it will speak very good Jive.
00:25:53,00:25:56,So this back was about the black market.
00:25:56,00:25:58,So selling music on the black market.
00:25:58,00:26:01,So I had to look at some of the black market stuff.
00:26:01,00:26:03,What do you reckon is the most expensive
00:26:03,00:26:06,of your bodily organs on the black market?
00:26:06,00:26:10,- Eyeballs.
00:26:10,00:26:14,"- Oh, corneas, $30,000 on the black market about."
00:26:14,00:26:16,"This is according to the website Ranker,"
00:26:16,00:26:18,which has got quite a few.
00:26:18,00:26:20,It does have quite a lot of good sources in this list.
00:26:20,00:26:22,"So I can't, I'll say,"
00:26:22,00:26:26,a kidney.
00:26:26,00:26:27,"- Oh, got it in one, Andy."
00:26:27,00:26:28,I can't believe it.
00:26:28,00:26:29,"Yeah, kidney."
00:26:29,00:26:32,"So apparently if you wanna buy a kidney on the black market,"
00:26:32,00:26:35,"it's gonna cost you approximately $200,000."
00:26:35,00:26:38,And they sourced for that a book called
00:26:38,00:26:40,"Cultural Anthropology by William Haveland,"
00:26:40,00:26:41,which came out in 2010.
00:26:41,00:26:44,So it might be quite a bit more than that now.
00:26:44,00:26:47,"But compared to $200,000 for your kidneys,"
00:26:47,00:26:49,"about $157,000 for your liver."
00:26:49,00:26:50,"That's what you said, Anna, wasn't it?"
00:26:50,00:26:54,"So probably second, your heart,"
00:26:54,00:26:56,apparently an illegally obtained heart
00:26:56,00:27:00,"is only worth about $119,000."
00:27:00,00:27:02,"And I think the reason for that is,"
00:27:02,00:27:07,you need to have such a specialist to put your heart in.
00:27:07,00:27:11,"Really, if you're in a situation where you need a new heart,"
00:27:11,00:27:13,you're probably in a legit hospital.
00:27:13,00:27:16,"So there's not many people on the street corner going,"
00:27:16,00:27:17,"""Anyone got a heart?"""
00:27:17,00:27:18,"- Oh, it's kidneys."
00:27:18,00:27:20,"You can just ram it in, can't you?"
00:27:20,00:27:22,"- Stop it, I'll put it on, hope for the best."
00:27:22,00:27:24,(laughing)
00:27:24,00:27:25,"That's one way, yeah."
00:27:25,00:27:26,"- When you say street corners,"
00:27:26,00:27:29,"is that like, I feel like it's more,"
00:27:29,00:27:30,"that's more high-end selling, right?"
00:27:30,00:27:33,Because I imagine I've got a kidney
00:27:33,00:27:36,"or I've got a bootleg copy of, you know, grown-ups too."
00:27:36,00:27:41,"You know, those are the things I'd expect on a street corner."
00:27:41,00:27:43,"- I don't think it's just, it's probably, it is."
00:27:43,00:27:45,"I mean, apart from anything else,"
00:27:45,00:27:46,"if you're giving someone a kidney,"
00:27:46,00:27:48,"it has to be kept in a very sterile,"
00:27:48,00:27:49,very cold environment.
00:27:49,00:27:53,"It can't be, you can't open up your coat"
00:27:53,00:27:54,"and on the inside lining,"
00:27:54,00:27:56,it's just got a load of organs just hanging off it.
00:27:56,00:27:58,That's not gonna work out.
00:27:58,00:27:59,(laughing)
00:27:59,00:28:01,"- Thanks for a lovely coat, though."
00:28:01,00:28:02,- Yeah.
00:28:02,00:28:04,- Sounds like something Lady Gargoyle would wear.
00:28:04,00:28:04,- Yes.
00:28:04,00:28:07,(upbeat music)
00:28:07,00:28:12,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three"
00:28:12,00:28:14,and that is James.
00:28:14,00:28:16,"- Okay, my fact this week is that the world's longest"
00:28:16,00:28:20,water slide is almost 20 times longer
00:28:20,00:28:22,than the world's shortest river.
00:28:22,00:28:24,- Insane.
00:28:24,00:28:25,- Great.
00:28:25,00:28:27,- Which one is more surprising?
00:28:27,00:28:28,"What, what are the lengths?"
00:28:28,00:28:29,And I'll decide which one I'm more surprised by.
00:28:29,00:28:31,The shortness of the river or the length of the water slide?
00:28:31,00:28:33,"- Okay, well, the river,"
00:28:33,00:28:35,which we might get onto a bit later
00:28:35,00:28:36,"'cause it's a bit controversial,"
00:28:36,00:28:41,the river is 201 feet or 61 meters long
00:28:41,00:28:46,"and the water slide is 1,111 meters."
00:28:46,00:28:52,"So that's over a kilometer long, 3,645 feet."
00:28:52,00:28:54,- So cool.
00:28:54,00:28:55,- It's amazing.
00:28:55,00:28:58,- I think the water slide is a more stunning one
00:28:58,00:29:00,to go over a kilometer in a water slide.
00:29:00,00:29:04,"And this is in Penang, which is in Malaysia,"
00:29:04,00:29:06,in northern Malaysia.
00:29:06,00:29:08,And it was recently featured
00:29:08,00:29:10,on the Guinness World Records YouTube channel
00:29:10,00:29:12,where they showed a video of someone
00:29:12,00:29:16,going all the way down this water slide.
00:29:16,00:29:18,"And like I say, it's four minutes long."
00:29:18,00:29:19,"And to get to this water slide,"
00:29:19,00:29:22,you have to go on a cable car chairlift.
00:29:22,00:29:24,You can't just walk up the stairs or anything
00:29:24,00:29:26,like you would in a normal water park.
00:29:26,00:29:29,It's one of those where you're in like a little rubber ring
00:29:29,00:29:31,and you go down there.
00:29:31,00:29:32,- The best kind.
00:29:32,00:29:33,- Yeah.
00:29:33,00:29:35,"- Relaxing, but also thrilling, I think, yeah."
00:29:35,00:29:36,"- Oh, that's kind of controversial statement."
00:29:36,00:29:39,"- No, because it is better"
00:29:39,00:29:44,because the water doesn't jet up you in the same way.
00:29:44,00:29:47,"- Some people like that, I must say."
00:29:47,00:29:48,"- Yeah, okay, yeah."
00:29:48,00:29:49,- Tickles like kidneys.
00:29:49,00:29:56,"But yeah, some people just like the simplicity"
00:29:56,00:29:58,of just sitting down and you're swimming cosy
00:29:58,00:30:00,and going straight down on your bum.
00:30:00,00:30:01,- It's very true.
00:30:01,00:30:02,- It's very true.
00:30:02,00:30:03,- You've got no protection.
00:30:03,00:30:05,The ring takes away some of the risk factor.
00:30:05,00:30:06,- And that's what I like about it.
00:30:06,00:30:07,- Yep.
00:30:07,00:30:08,(all laughing)
00:30:08,00:30:11,- I think also a ring like sometimes it makes you go
00:30:11,00:30:13,further off the edge and makes it feel a bit scarier
00:30:13,00:30:14,if you're going fast.
00:30:14,00:30:16,"- It is scarier, I agree."
00:30:16,00:30:18,"If you take a corner too hard,"
00:30:18,00:30:20,you risk flying out of the whole thing.
00:30:20,00:30:22,That's happened to me a couple of times.
00:30:22,00:30:23,- Really?
00:30:23,00:30:25,"- Yeah, and it's petrifying."
00:30:25,00:30:25,- You've come out.
00:30:25,00:30:29,"- Well, I sort of went a bit over the lip on a corner"
00:30:29,00:30:31,and that really scared me to never really push it
00:30:31,00:30:33,on a water slide ever again.
00:30:33,00:30:35,What's amazing though about this water slide is that--
00:30:35,00:30:36,- I'm just imagining how lame
00:30:36,00:30:38,you all are at a water park.
00:30:38,00:30:39,(all laughing)
00:30:39,00:30:40,- What?
00:30:40,00:30:41,"- I'm going, I had a terrifying experience"
00:30:41,00:30:42,when I went quite far up the wall
00:30:42,00:30:44,"and you're going, oh, I'd rather do this sort of"
00:30:44,00:30:48,in a car so that I'm not touching any cars or anything.
00:30:48,00:30:49,(all laughing)
00:30:49,00:30:52,- I always keep my hands on the side to slow me down.
00:30:52,00:30:54,And then I have to push myself along
00:30:54,00:30:56,'cause the water's not pushing me.
00:30:56,00:30:57,- Yeah.
00:30:57,00:30:58,(all laughing)
00:30:58,00:30:59,"- It's a shinski behind me, probably."
00:30:59,00:31:01,I'm doing a bomb shape.
00:31:01,00:31:03,(all laughing)
00:31:03,00:31:04,- Bloody rocket on the back of it.
00:31:04,00:31:07,(all laughing)
00:31:07,00:31:09,"- But this visually, this is an amazing water slide."
00:31:09,00:31:11,Like the first thing to say about it
00:31:11,00:31:13,is it's a physical water slide.
00:31:13,00:31:15,"So the previous sort of, the previous record"
00:31:15,00:31:19,"for the longest water slide was in Vernon, New Jersey."
00:31:19,00:31:21,"And that was an inflatable water slide,"
00:31:21,00:31:23,which is what I immediately pictured
00:31:23,00:31:25,"when you sent this fact, James."
00:31:25,00:31:28,But this goes through this beautiful dense forest
00:31:28,00:31:30,"and it's open-top and you're just, you know,"
00:31:30,00:31:33,you're going through trees and it's absolutely--
00:31:33,00:31:34,"- Oh, wow."
00:31:34,00:31:36,"- It's basically, if you flip out of that, Dan,"
00:31:36,00:31:39,you're living with the squirrels for quite a few years
00:31:39,00:31:40,"before they find you again, thank you."
00:31:40,00:31:42,(all laughing)
00:31:42,00:31:44,"- That's how Tarzan starts, isn't it?"
00:31:44,00:31:46,(all laughing)
00:31:46,00:31:48,So is it a straight line?
00:31:48,00:31:49,It's not winding around around a hundred inches.
00:31:49,00:31:50,"- No, very much winding, yeah."
00:31:50,00:31:53,You end up quite close to where you began.
00:31:53,00:31:54,- Good to know.
00:31:54,00:31:56,"- And it has leisurely bits in it as well,"
00:31:56,00:31:58,where it sort of goes on a bit more of a flat
00:31:58,00:31:59,"and you just, you know,"
00:31:59,00:32:02,you just go along quite nicely pushed by the stream.
00:32:02,00:32:04,Now that sounds interesting to me.
00:32:04,00:32:05,- That's Andy's comment.
00:32:05,00:32:06,(all laughing)
00:32:06,00:32:07,- Andy's reading Pride and Prejudice on the way down
00:32:07,00:32:09,is waterproof copy.
00:32:09,00:32:11,(all laughing)
00:32:11,00:32:14,"- Yeah, I've never really sort of looked into"
00:32:14,00:32:16,"or thought about water slides at all before,"
00:32:16,00:32:17,but they're amazing.
00:32:17,00:32:21,"They, you know, I really like the pioneer of water sliding,"
00:32:21,00:32:22,Dick Krull.
00:32:22,00:32:25,- One of them.
00:32:25,00:32:26,"- Oh, his sound fun."
00:32:26,00:32:27,"Like, oh, and Dick Krull's water slide."
00:32:27,00:32:30,"- It sounds like an original name for Dick Dastardly,"
00:32:30,00:32:31,doesn't it?
00:32:31,00:32:32,- Yeah.
00:32:32,00:32:35,"- He dug a five acre lake,"
00:32:35,00:32:38,which he was going to be using for bass fishing.
00:32:38,00:32:41,"Bass the fish, obviously."
00:32:41,00:32:43,(all laughing)
00:32:43,00:32:45,- Not the make of better.
00:32:45,00:32:45,"- I'm sorry, yeah."
00:32:45,00:32:48,(all laughing)
00:32:48,00:32:49,- And then he had all this dirt
00:32:49,00:32:52,"and he shaped the dirt into this massive great ramp,"
00:32:52,00:32:55,"350 feet long, which was a waterfall."
00:32:55,00:32:56,And then he realized it could be
00:32:56,00:32:57,a recreational water slide.
00:32:57,00:32:59,"And that was supposedly the world's first,"
00:32:59,00:33:01,but actually I think there was some.
00:33:01,00:33:02,- When was that?
00:33:02,00:33:04,- That was '71.
00:33:04,00:33:06,"- '71, okay, yeah."
00:33:06,00:33:09,"- Oh, 'cause there was another guy who dug his own lake"
00:33:09,00:33:12,with similar results called Bob Byers.
00:33:12,00:33:13,And he created Lake Dolores.
00:33:13,00:33:15,"He called it, it was named after his wife."
00:33:15,00:33:17,"And this was a water park, a recreational water park"
00:33:17,00:33:20,that he created just for his family.
00:33:20,00:33:22,This was in the late fifties that he did this.
00:33:22,00:33:25,So he made this lake in a series of pools and channels
00:33:25,00:33:27,and people would drive past it and noticed it
00:33:27,00:33:28,"and rocked up and would be like,"
00:33:28,00:33:31,"""Hey, can I have a go in this fun recreational lake"
00:33:31,00:33:32,"""you've created?"""
00:33:32,00:33:36,"And so then, yeah, he added eight 150 foot slides."
00:33:36,00:33:39,"And he also added, which doesn't seem to exist anymore,"
00:33:39,00:33:41,two standing slides.
00:33:41,00:33:43,And they're really cool photos of doing this.
00:33:43,00:33:45,So they're kind of in a V shape.
00:33:45,00:33:47,So you stand up and your feet are just squashed
00:33:47,00:33:49,into the little bottom of the V.
00:33:49,00:33:50,And you shoot down very fast.
00:33:50,00:33:52,I think they go at like a 60 degree slope.
00:33:52,00:33:54,So really steep.
00:33:54,00:33:57,"And you're on a little, it looks like you're on a little,"
00:33:57,00:33:58,"you know, those floats you'd have in a pool"
00:33:58,00:34:01,"before you could swim, like standing on one of those."
00:34:01,00:34:02,- What do you mean before?
00:34:02,00:34:05,I don't know if you can swim or not.
00:34:05,00:34:07,"- Yeah, they are."
00:34:07,00:34:09,"- Of course, your mum makes you bring them"
00:34:09,00:34:11,into the office every day in case it rains.
00:34:11,00:34:14,"Yeah, it sounds amazing."
00:34:14,00:34:17,And then it's shut down.
00:34:17,00:34:20,"- Did you see the sort of like original,"
00:34:20,00:34:21,original water slides?
00:34:21,00:34:24,The ones that didn't have water on them?
00:34:24,00:34:24,Have you spotted those ones?
00:34:24,00:34:26,"- Like just slides, are they?"
00:34:26,00:34:27,"- Yeah, there were slides,"
00:34:27,00:34:28,but you ended up in the water.
00:34:28,00:34:30,"So they got the ending right,"
00:34:30,00:34:32,but they didn't get the initial bit.
00:34:32,00:34:34,"Well, actually, you didn't even really end up in the water."
00:34:34,00:34:36,Basically what it was is in New Zealand
00:34:36,00:34:39,"as part of the 1906 International Exhibition,"
00:34:39,00:34:40,they had this wonderland.
00:34:40,00:34:44,And they created these slides where you went down in boats.
00:34:44,00:34:48,"And once you got to the bottom, you traveled, you know,"
00:34:48,00:34:51,you were basically skimming across the water in a boat
00:34:51,00:34:53,as you got to the bottom.
00:34:53,00:34:57,"And that got developed later in 1923 to Herbert Selner,"
00:34:57,00:34:59,"who lived in America, who created it,"
00:34:59,00:35:01,but with a sort of sled.
00:35:01,00:35:02,"So when you went down on the sled,"
00:35:02,00:35:04,"you would eventually topple into the water,"
00:35:04,00:35:06,but it got you about a hundred feet
00:35:06,00:35:10,of skimming across the water once you'd reached the bottom.
00:35:10,00:35:12,"And those were the kind of precursors before they realized,"
00:35:12,00:35:14,"oh, let's just put water in and lose the sled."
00:35:14,00:35:16,- They're very cool.
00:35:16,00:35:18,"- I think, yeah, they are cool."
00:35:18,00:35:20,There was one of those in Coney Island as well.
00:35:20,00:35:23,We talked about Coney Island the other week
00:35:23,00:35:26,as one that was in Coney Island in 1895.
00:35:26,00:35:29,"But this one in the International Exhibition in 1906,"
00:35:29,00:35:32,"it went into Lake Victoria in Christchurch,"
00:35:32,00:35:34,was the place it ended up.
00:35:34,00:35:37,"And it was, this exhibition was so popular"
00:35:37,00:35:42,"that 1,967,682 people visited it"
00:35:42,00:35:45,at a time when the whole population of New Zealand
00:35:45,00:35:48,"was 975,000."
00:35:48,00:35:51,So more than twice as many people went to this
00:35:51,00:35:53,as lived in the whole country.
00:35:53,00:35:55,And then this slide got bought out
00:35:55,00:35:57,and got taken to Wellington.
00:35:57,00:35:59,And they had it there for a few years
00:35:59,00:36:00,and eventually it got taken down.
00:36:00,00:36:02,But the position where it was in Wellington
00:36:02,00:36:05,is where Peter Jackson's studio is at today.
00:36:05,00:36:07,- Really? - Yeah.
00:36:07,00:36:10,- So it's seen a lot over the years that place.
00:36:10,00:36:12,Was that the one which this guy called Arthur Guinness
00:36:12,00:36:13,went down?
00:36:13,00:36:15,I think there was a newspaper report from 1906
00:36:15,00:36:17,and he was the Speaker of the House of Representatives
00:36:17,00:36:18,at the time.
00:36:18,00:36:20,And the only reason it's funny is if you Google
00:36:20,00:36:22,"Arthur Guinness, the Speaker of the House of Representatives"
00:36:22,00:36:24,of New Zealand in 1906.
00:36:24,00:36:27,And he's got a huge white wig on.
00:36:27,00:36:29,I'm not sure that he wore this
00:36:29,00:36:31,when he was going down the slide.
00:36:31,00:36:33,But his white wig was one of those really elaborate
00:36:33,00:36:35,"waxed mustaches, huge beard."
00:36:35,00:36:37,And the newspaper report said he turned up
00:36:37,00:36:39,and the next thing all spectators knew was
00:36:39,00:36:42,there was a tall black hat among a lot of girls
00:36:42,00:36:44,being hauled up in the carriage.
00:36:44,00:36:46,"And then as it shot down the slope,"
00:36:46,00:36:49,he had his silk hat pulled over his ears
00:36:49,00:36:52,and a hard point of order look in his eye.
00:36:52,00:36:53,"Which I'm not sure how that goes,"
00:36:53,00:36:55,"but as they splashed into the water, somebody shouted,"
00:36:55,00:36:57,"""Point of order!"""
00:36:57,00:36:58,- Classic. - Funny joke.
00:36:58,00:36:59,- Great. - Yeah.
00:36:59,00:37:02,- Classic satire. - Yeah.
00:37:02,00:37:02,- That's really good.
00:37:02,00:37:05,"- The very start of this section, dear listener,"
00:37:05,00:37:08,"you might remember, was that the longest water slide"
00:37:08,00:37:10,is 20 times longer than the world's shortest river.
00:37:10,00:37:13,So I should quickly tell you about the world's shortest river.
00:37:13,00:37:16,And that is the Roe River.
00:37:16,00:37:19,But it's extremely controversial.
00:37:19,00:37:22,- Has it said a few out-of-date things?
00:37:22,00:37:26,- Has it been cancelled? - It's been cancelled.
00:37:26,00:37:28,This was something I read in an article
00:37:28,00:37:30,"on the website ""Conday Nest"""
00:37:30,00:37:34,"and it was written by Jeopardy Champion in America, Ken Jennings."
00:37:34,00:37:37,And it was basically the argument between two rivers
00:37:37,00:37:40,"in America, the Roe River and the D River,"
00:37:40,00:37:42,about which was the shortest.
00:37:42,00:37:43,So the Guinness Book of Records had always said
00:37:43,00:37:46,that the D River was the shortest.
00:37:46,00:37:48,"But then one day in 1987,"
00:37:48,00:37:51,there was a teacher called Mrs. Susie Nardlinger.
00:37:51,00:37:54,And she got her fifth grade class to measure
00:37:54,00:37:57,this little kind of water near their school
00:37:57,00:37:59,and work out how long it was.
00:37:59,00:38:01,And they realized that it was shorter
00:38:01,00:38:04,than this so-called world's shortest river.
00:38:04,00:38:05,"But it didn't have a name,"
00:38:05,00:38:07,so it couldn't be in the Guinness Book of Records.
00:38:07,00:38:10,And so they wrote to the US Board on geographical names
00:38:10,00:38:13,"and they got them to give it a name, which was the Roe River."
00:38:13,00:38:15,And then the Guinness Book of Records
00:38:15,00:38:17,put that as the world's shortest river.
00:38:17,00:38:21,"Now, the people who lived near the D River were furious"
00:38:21,00:38:23,because they'd lost their records
00:38:23,00:38:25,"to these bloody school kids, okay?"
00:38:25,00:38:27,And this was in Lincoln City.
00:38:27,00:38:30,And there was the Chamber of Commerce in Lincoln City
00:38:30,00:38:33,said that this Roe River was nothing more
00:38:33,00:38:37,than a drainage ditch surveyed for a school project.
00:38:37,00:38:42,- One man's drainage ditch is another man's noble river.
00:38:42,00:38:43,So-
00:38:43,00:38:45,- I think that's one way of looking at it.
00:38:45,00:38:47,"Mrs. Nardlinger, when she was told this,"
00:38:47,00:38:50,said that the D River was nothing more
00:38:50,00:38:52,than an ocean water backup.
00:38:52,00:38:54,And so there was this massive argument
00:38:54,00:38:56,between these two people about which was the shortest
00:38:56,00:38:58,and whether they were even real rivers
00:38:58,00:39:00,or they were just effluent pipes
00:39:00,00:39:03,or bits of the ocean coming in or whatever.
00:39:03,00:39:05,"And eventually Guinness just said,"
00:39:05,00:39:08,"you know what, let's not do this record anymore."
00:39:08,00:39:11,"And so they just, if you get a Guinness Book of Records now,"
00:39:11,00:39:12,it's not in there anymore.
00:39:12,00:39:16,"- So cowardly, if they'd just stuck to their guns."
00:39:16,00:39:19,"I mean, it was also a crazy record to have, isn't it?"
00:39:19,00:39:21,"Because they're both sides are saying to each other,"
00:39:21,00:39:23,"oh, yours is rubbish and tiny."
00:39:23,00:39:25,"And yeah, that's kind of the point."
00:39:25,00:39:27,"- Yes, we're not tiny enough."
00:39:27,00:39:29,- Yeah. - Exactly.
00:39:29,00:39:31,- I think I found a water slide actually
00:39:31,00:39:33,"that would suit both you, Andy and you, Anna."
00:39:33,00:39:36,It's got the danger and the leisure at the same time.
00:39:36,00:39:38,And this is in the Bahamas.
00:39:38,00:39:39,"And so what it is is you,"
00:39:39,00:39:42,it's called the Serpent Water Slide at the Atlantis Resort.
00:39:42,00:39:46,"And you go down and it's a normal water slide,"
00:39:46,00:39:49,"but then Andy, you come out into a sort of,"
00:39:49,00:39:51,"what takes about two minutes to get across,"
00:39:51,00:39:54,leisurely bit where you're just in your rubber ring
00:39:54,00:39:58,and you're going very nicely to the end.
00:39:58,00:39:59,Where the danger bit comes in
00:39:59,00:40:03,"is when you're having that leisurely bit in the slide,"
00:40:03,00:40:06,you are in the middle of a giant aquarium
00:40:06,00:40:08,with sharks on either side of you.
00:40:08,00:40:09,"- Yeah, it looks amazing."
00:40:09,00:40:11,"My friend's been on that one actually,"
00:40:11,00:40:13,weirdly got a tutoring job with a family.
00:40:13,00:40:15,"And then after tutoring them,"
00:40:15,00:40:17,"this was years ago, I realized they were incredibly rich"
00:40:17,00:40:20,and got taken for two weeks in the Bahamas with them
00:40:20,00:40:22,and said it was so fantastic.
00:40:22,00:40:23,- That's so funny.
00:40:23,00:40:24,I thought you were going to say
00:40:24,00:40:26,that they were tutoring in the Bahamas
00:40:26,00:40:28,"and they were so incredibly rich,"
00:40:28,00:40:29,they took them to a water park.
00:40:29,00:40:36,"- I mean, we can only dream one day"
00:40:36,00:40:38,we'll be able to afford a thought park.
00:40:38,00:40:40,"- Right at the very top of this fact, Dan,"
00:40:40,00:40:42,you said that the previous record holder
00:40:42,00:40:45,of the longest slide was in New Jersey.
00:40:45,00:40:48,It was in a place called Action Park.
00:40:48,00:40:50,And Action Park is more famous on the internet
00:40:50,00:40:53,for having this incredible water slide
00:40:53,00:40:55,"which had a loop-the-loop at the bottom,"
00:40:55,00:40:59,which was only open for one month in 1985.
00:40:59,00:41:01,- Mad.
00:41:01,00:41:02,- It is incredible.
00:41:02,00:41:04,"Basically what happens is you go down,"
00:41:04,00:41:06,you get enough speed and you fly around the loop-the-loop
00:41:06,00:41:08,and you've got enough speed that you can stay
00:41:08,00:41:09,on the edge of the loop-the-loop
00:41:09,00:41:11,and then you come out at the end.
00:41:11,00:41:13,The centrifugal force sort of holds you
00:41:13,00:41:15,to the edge of the loop-the-loop.
00:41:15,00:41:16,But the problem is if you're like Andy
00:41:16,00:41:18,"and you kind of, or me I should say,"
00:41:18,00:41:19,"'cause I said this earlier,"
00:41:19,00:41:20,you kind of put your hands on it
00:41:20,00:41:22,"to slow yourself down, right?"
00:41:22,00:41:24,"If you did that, you don't have enough speed"
00:41:24,00:41:26,to get around the loop-the-loop.
00:41:26,00:41:28,And so one thing that can happen
00:41:28,00:41:30,"is if you get halfway and you run out of speed,"
00:41:30,00:41:32,you just smack your head down
00:41:32,00:41:34,because gravity takes over.
00:41:34,00:41:36,Another thing is you could get halfway up
00:41:36,00:41:38,and then come right the way back down again
00:41:38,00:41:40,"to the very, very bottom."
00:41:40,00:41:42,And then there's no way out of the slide
00:41:42,00:41:45,because you literally can't get out.
00:41:45,00:41:45,And so they had-
00:41:45,00:41:48,- Netashinsky's coming up right behind you.
00:41:48,00:41:49,"- Well, you've got to send people."
00:41:49,00:41:52,You've got to send people down to shove you along.
00:41:52,00:41:54,"- Well, eventually instead of that solution,"
00:41:54,00:41:56,they built a hatch at the bottom to let people out
00:41:56,00:41:57,if they got stuck.
00:41:57,00:41:59,"- So that's, I've been on one that has the same thing."
00:41:59,00:42:02,There's my favorite water slide I've ever been on
00:42:02,00:42:03,is in the Gold Coast.
00:42:03,00:42:04,And if you do live in Australia
00:42:04,00:42:06,"and you haven't been to it, you've got to."
00:42:06,00:42:07,And it's basically that.
00:42:07,00:42:08,It's incredible.
00:42:08,00:42:10,I think it's a place called Wet and Wild.
00:42:10,00:42:12,And you stand up really high at the top.
00:42:12,00:42:13,So you start super high.
00:42:13,00:42:15,You're standing on a trap door.
00:42:15,00:42:17,"And then, you know, they do a lot of,"
00:42:17,00:42:18,"oh, you're ready?"
00:42:18,00:42:19,"Oh, are we going to go yet?"
00:42:19,00:42:22,And then the trap door suddenly vanishes.
00:42:22,00:42:23,And so you plummet down.
00:42:23,00:42:25,So you drop vertically really fast for ages.
00:42:25,00:42:27,"And then you do the loop, the loop,"
00:42:27,00:42:29,which is so awesome.
00:42:29,00:42:31,So a woman did get stuck in it.
00:42:31,00:42:32,"'Cause I remember seeing when I was going to go on it,"
00:42:32,00:42:35,I saw this escape hatch in this loop.
00:42:35,00:42:37,"And I was like, I wonder if that's ever been used."
00:42:37,00:42:39,And there was indeed a woman who got stuck in it
00:42:39,00:42:40,a few years ago.
00:42:40,00:42:42,So you operate the hatch from inside
00:42:42,00:42:43,or do they have to have someone?
00:42:43,00:42:44,You do.
00:42:44,00:42:46,"So she said, she realized she was stuck."
00:42:46,00:42:48,"And she thought, my God,"
00:42:48,00:42:49,it's someone going to come down after me.
00:42:49,00:42:51,I better clutch at this escape hatch with my hand
00:42:51,00:42:53,and pull yourself out.
00:42:53,00:42:56,"Well, the one in New Jersey, anyway,"
00:42:56,00:42:58,there was an interview on deadspin.com
00:42:58,00:42:59,with one of the people who worked there.
00:42:59,00:43:01,And they said that the main problem was
00:43:01,00:43:03,"that at the very bottom of the loop, the loop,"
00:43:03,00:43:06,a load of kind of sand and dirt and stuff
00:43:06,00:43:07,would kind of accumulate.
00:43:07,00:43:08,And they won't be able to get rid of it.
00:43:08,00:43:10,"And so as you went down,"
00:43:10,00:43:11,"as soon as you got to the bottom of the loop,"
00:43:11,00:43:14,"the loop, it would just drag against your back"
00:43:14,00:43:16,and just basically take all the skin off the bottom
00:43:16,00:43:19,of your back before you came out.
00:43:19,00:43:21,So that's why it's not there anymore.
00:43:21,00:43:22,Jesus.
00:43:22,00:43:25,They are painful.
00:43:25,00:43:26,"It's worth it because they're great,"
00:43:26,00:43:28,"but almost all good water slides,"
00:43:28,00:43:31,"you end up with some serious, crazy things, don't you?"
00:43:31,00:43:32,Not that painful.
00:43:32,00:43:34,Not to the end without your back.
00:43:34,00:43:37,(upbeat music)
00:43:37,00:43:43,"Okay, it is time for fact number four."
00:43:43,00:43:44,And that is my fact.
00:43:44,00:43:48,My fact this week is that scientists in the South Pole
00:43:48,00:43:51,are starting to speak with an Antarctic accent.
00:43:51,00:43:57,This is an interesting thing that was studied
00:43:57,00:44:00,by the University of Munich.
00:44:00,00:44:03,And the idea was they wanted to see what effect
00:44:03,00:44:06,being isolated in a place like Antarctica
00:44:06,00:44:09,would have on a communal accent.
00:44:09,00:44:13,And the scientists at this university decided
00:44:13,00:44:14,that they were gonna do a case study
00:44:14,00:44:17,where they took 11 members of the bases there.
00:44:17,00:44:19,And they got them to sit down
00:44:19,00:44:22,and say 28 different words into a recorder
00:44:22,00:44:23,before their departure.
00:44:23,00:44:25,And these-- - Into a recorder.
00:44:25,00:44:27,Is this the same recorder that was up that nose?
00:44:27,00:44:30,(all laughing)
00:44:30,00:44:32,"- Yeah, sorry, they were recording their voices."
00:44:32,00:44:34,"Yeah, there was eight Brits, it was one American,"
00:44:34,00:44:37,it was a German and someone from Iceland.
00:44:37,00:44:40,"And then every six weeks for their entire stay,"
00:44:40,00:44:43,they would get them to do a further recording
00:44:43,00:44:45,of the same 28 words.
00:44:45,00:44:47,And they noticed as they were going along
00:44:47,00:44:50,that their accents were all converging
00:44:50,00:44:52,towards the same vowel sounds.
00:44:52,00:44:55,"For example, if they came in saying food,"
00:44:55,00:44:58,they all started saying food.
00:44:58,00:45:00,"Now, that doesn't sound too different."
00:45:00,00:45:03,"It's very tiny, but what it is is the back of the throat"
00:45:03,00:45:06,"is being used for the first food that I'm saying there, food."
00:45:06,00:45:09,And then food is the front of my mouth using it.
00:45:09,00:45:13,And they all merged to this one same vowel sound.
00:45:13,00:45:15,"Now, it's a very small study and there's a great video,"
00:45:15,00:45:16,"by the way, to watch about it"
00:45:16,00:45:19,on the Hafer's Interesting website on YouTube.
00:45:19,00:45:21,"Do check it out, it's a real proper explanation of it."
00:45:21,00:45:23,And they show you all the sounds.
00:45:23,00:45:26,But they noticed that an Antarctic accent
00:45:26,00:45:28,was emerging as a result.
00:45:28,00:45:28,- That's very cool.
00:45:28,00:45:31,- But such a shame that they didn't do what I definitely
00:45:31,00:45:32,"would have done and said,"
00:45:32,00:45:34,should we just really screw with these guys
00:45:34,00:45:37,and turn up six weeks later going food.
00:45:37,00:45:39,"And I just, wow."
00:45:39,00:45:42,- Is it very cool or is it very cool?
00:45:42,00:45:43,Or is it very cool?
00:45:43,00:45:44,(laughing)
00:45:44,00:45:46,- Cue.
00:45:46,00:45:48,"Yes, vowel fronting."
00:45:48,00:45:50,That does seem to be what happens to the sounds
00:45:50,00:45:52,that we make over time.
00:45:52,00:45:54,And there's this thing called goose fronting.
00:45:54,00:45:56,"Did you guys, have you read about this?"
00:45:56,00:45:57,- I know.
00:45:57,00:45:58,- It's this really cool linguistic thing
00:45:58,00:46:01,that was defined in 1983.
00:46:01,00:46:06,And it basically uses goose as the example word.
00:46:06,00:46:07,"So exactly as Dan says,"
00:46:07,00:46:11,we tend to start with words that have our tongue high up
00:46:11,00:46:14,and closer to the back of our mouth.
00:46:14,00:46:15,And it makes a more rounded sound.
00:46:15,00:46:18,"And over time, the tongue comes forward"
00:46:18,00:46:20,"and it makes a slightly more,"
00:46:20,00:46:21,sort of sounds a bit more nasal sound.
00:46:21,00:46:26,So goose used to be said in a more sonorous rounded way.
00:46:26,00:46:28,"And it's increasingly being said,"
00:46:28,00:46:31,"like goose, goose, goose."
00:46:31,00:46:33,In some places it's almost indistinguishable
00:46:33,00:46:35,from geese apparently.
00:46:35,00:46:36,- Geese.
00:46:36,00:46:37,- And then we don't know why this is happening.
00:46:37,00:46:39,"It's happening all around the world, goose fronting."
00:46:39,00:46:43,"- Apparently, especially in southern British English, I read."
00:46:43,00:46:44,- Yes.
00:46:44,00:46:47,- I never noticed that you guys said the word goose
00:46:47,00:46:48,different than the way I say the word goose.
00:46:48,00:46:49,- Geese.
00:46:49,00:46:53,"- But goose, how often have you heard us say goose though?"
00:46:53,00:46:54,It's rare for me to say goose.
00:46:54,00:46:57,"- I can imagine the queen would say goose, goose."
00:46:57,00:46:58,- Geese.
00:46:58,00:46:59,- Geese.
00:46:59,00:47:00,- Geese.
00:47:00,00:47:01,- Goose.
00:47:01,00:47:02,- Geese.
00:47:02,00:47:03,- Get that goose off my swab.
00:47:03,00:47:06,(laughing)
00:47:06,00:47:08,"- There was another aspect of this Antarctic study,"
00:47:08,00:47:11,"which is, I mean, this is again in the runs of theory now,"
00:47:11,00:47:15,but it was a theory that people might develop accents faster
00:47:15,00:47:19,if survival is more uncertain or more at risk.
00:47:19,00:47:23,So it helps if you can understand
00:47:23,00:47:25,what people are saying bluntly.
00:47:25,00:47:28,And it might accelerate the process
00:47:28,00:47:29,if there is more life and death situations.
00:47:29,00:47:30,- Really?
00:47:30,00:47:31,- Allegedly.
00:47:31,00:47:32,"- I mean, over a long period of time though,"
00:47:32,00:47:36,"it's not like if you get stuck in a, you know, water slide,"
00:47:36,00:47:37,you're not going to suddenly start talking
00:47:37,00:47:40,"with a Geordie accent or something, it's like."
00:47:40,00:47:42,"- We want to help, but we can't understand you anymore."
00:47:42,00:47:43,You've been in there so long.
00:47:43,00:47:46,"- If you're in, if I went to a water park in Newcastle"
00:47:46,00:47:50,"and I was stuck in there, I might, in my panic, try."
00:47:50,00:47:54,- So I think that might make it much less likely
00:47:54,00:47:55,"that you're rescued, don't you?"
00:47:55,00:47:57,(laughing)
00:47:57,00:48:00,"Or can you like, add that deck, let me out of here,"
00:48:00,00:48:01,let me get me.
00:48:01,00:48:04,- Who's this dickhead?
00:48:04,00:48:05,Leave him in there.
00:48:05,00:48:07,(laughing)
00:48:07,00:48:08,That is cool.
00:48:08,00:48:10,"So the idea is that these scientists in the Antarctic,"
00:48:10,00:48:12,"if one of them wakes up and is unintelligible to the others,"
00:48:12,00:48:14,then they won't be able to survive.
00:48:14,00:48:15,So they will-
00:48:15,00:48:16,- We've run out of food.
00:48:16,00:48:17,What's he saying?
00:48:17,00:48:19,"Food, we've run out of food."
00:48:19,00:48:22,"Don't get it, mate, we've run out of what?"
00:48:22,00:48:24,"- And there was this, one of these linguists"
00:48:24,00:48:27,was Jonathan Harrington from the University of Munich.
00:48:27,00:48:28,"And he said specifically,"
00:48:28,00:48:31,"it might be if people go to Mars, for instance,"
00:48:31,00:48:34,"and you have a group of people who have all gone to Mars,"
00:48:34,00:48:35,that by the time they come back
00:48:35,00:48:36,"or that we can talk to them,"
00:48:36,00:48:39,they might all have a different Mars accent.
00:48:39,00:48:41,"- So cool, such a cool idea."
00:48:41,00:48:42,"- Yeah, that's completely useless."
00:48:42,00:48:44,"Imagine if they go to Mars,"
00:48:44,00:48:46,"gather all this vital scientific data,"
00:48:46,00:48:47,bring it back and we've got no idea
00:48:47,00:48:49,what they're trying to tell us.
00:48:49,00:48:51,(laughing)
00:48:51,00:48:54,"- There is a thing where you,"
00:48:54,00:48:57,"basically the longer that the queen is around,"
00:48:57,00:48:59,the more you speak like the queen.
00:48:59,00:49:02,"If you are a naked mole rat,"
00:49:02,00:49:08,is a recent study where they looked at colonies
00:49:08,00:49:11,"of naked mole rats and naked mole rats, they're mammals,"
00:49:11,00:49:13,but they act a bit like bees and ants and stuff.
00:49:13,00:49:16,And they have a queen who's in charge of all the mating
00:49:16,00:49:18,and then all the workers and stuff like that.
00:49:18,00:49:21,But they found that the dialects
00:49:21,00:49:22,"of all these naked mole rats,"
00:49:22,00:49:24,all the little chirps and stuff they make
00:49:24,00:49:26,are very similar to what the queen makes.
00:49:26,00:49:28,"And then as soon as the queen dies,"
00:49:28,00:49:30,everyone sort of goes crazy
00:49:30,00:49:33,and does all sorts of weird accents and stuff like that.
00:49:33,00:49:34,"And then when they get a new queen,"
00:49:34,00:49:36,they all sort of go back towards
00:49:36,00:49:40,whatever that new queen's accent is like.
00:49:40,00:49:41,Isn't that cool?
00:49:41,00:49:44,"So we'd all be kind of like walking around to London going,"
00:49:44,00:49:45,how do you do?
00:49:45,00:49:45,How do you do?
00:49:45,00:49:46,How do you do?
00:49:46,00:49:48,"And then as soon as, you know,"
00:49:48,00:49:50,"hopefully very long in the future, the queen dies,"
00:49:50,00:49:54,"then I'll be going, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh."
00:49:54,00:49:54,- It's falling.
00:49:54,00:49:56,"- Hunts and trees, oh, that, yes."
00:49:56,00:50:00,"Monstrous carbuncle, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh."
00:50:00,00:50:01,"- Well, if you were a naked mole rat then,"
00:50:01,00:50:03,then that would be the perfect moment
00:50:03,00:50:08,to infiltrate the pack of another group of naked mole rats
00:50:08,00:50:11,because accents are incredibly important to them
00:50:11,00:50:14,"to the point where if you have a different accent,"
00:50:14,00:50:16,let's say you've got 300 members
00:50:16,00:50:18,"of a single colony of mole rats,"
00:50:18,00:50:20,naked mole rats living with each other.
00:50:20,00:50:23,And a random mole rat from a different colony
00:50:23,00:50:25,comes in and wants to hang out.
00:50:25,00:50:27,They hear its chirping accent.
00:50:27,00:50:30,"And if it's different, they'll kill it."
00:50:30,00:50:31,They'll just kill it.
00:50:31,00:50:31,- Wow.
00:50:31,00:50:35,- Their accents absolutely define who they are as a group.
00:50:35,00:50:38,And that's been studied quite a lot recently
00:50:38,00:50:40,"because there are other animals that speak with accents,"
00:50:40,00:50:42,but usually they're either water-based
00:50:42,00:50:44,or they're constantly moving around like primates.
00:50:44,00:50:46,"And it's really hard to track and really study,"
00:50:46,00:50:48,but they have been studying naked mole rats.
00:50:48,00:50:50,"And yeah, they are just vicious."
00:50:50,00:50:52,"- They also do that in Newcastle, Andy, by the way,"
00:50:52,00:50:55,just when we're touring there later this year.
00:50:55,00:50:56,"Just make sure wherever you go,"
00:50:56,00:50:58,you always do your Geordie accent.
00:50:58,00:50:59,- You won't be able to tell me
00:50:59,00:51:03,from born and bred Geordie by the time we get there.
00:51:03,00:51:04,It'll be amazing.
00:51:04,00:51:06,"Oh, here's a weird thing."
00:51:06,00:51:10,"Okay, so if I say to you,"
00:51:10,00:51:13,Ants don't sleep in a French accent.
00:51:13,00:51:15,"- Oh, is that one, that was that French?"
00:51:15,00:51:16,"- That was French, yeah."
00:51:16,00:51:18,- Can you do it again?
00:51:18,00:51:19,- Ants don't sleep.
00:51:19,00:51:20,"- I got it, yeah."
00:51:20,00:51:21,- In a French accent.
00:51:21,00:51:22,It's so clearly a French accent.
00:51:22,00:51:23,I can't believe you need it.
00:51:23,00:51:24,"Yeah, unbelievable."
00:51:24,00:51:30,"Do you believe me when I say that, that ants don't sleep?"
00:51:30,00:51:32,- Ants don't sleep.
00:51:32,00:51:33,- Okay.
00:51:33,00:51:36,"- I know, but only because we did it on the podcast."
00:51:36,00:51:38,They work 24.
00:51:38,00:51:39,"I know that's not the point you're trying to make right now,"
00:51:39,00:51:40,but yeah.
00:51:40,00:51:42,"- Some of them might sleep, I guess."
00:51:42,00:51:43,"If some of them work 24 hours,"
00:51:43,00:51:45,but other ones might sleep.
00:51:45,00:51:46,"- Oh yeah, there might be species."
00:51:46,00:51:47,- I believe you.
00:51:47,00:51:49,Perhaps it's because we've been working together
00:51:49,00:51:50,for 10 years.
00:51:50,00:51:51,(laughing)
00:51:51,00:51:53,"- So, the accent is relevant here,"
00:51:53,00:51:56,'cause there was a study by a couple of psychologists
00:51:56,00:52:00,about whether people trust more or less information
00:52:00,00:52:01,"that they hear in a foreign accent,"
00:52:01,00:52:03,or in their own native accent.
00:52:03,00:52:05,"And rather depressingly,"
00:52:05,00:52:07,people trust factual statements less
00:52:07,00:52:09,if they hear them in a foreign accent.
00:52:09,00:52:10,"- Oh, interesting."
00:52:10,00:52:12,So does that mean people who listen to this podcast
00:52:12,00:52:16,who aren't in the UK are gonna less believe our facts
00:52:16,00:52:18,than people in the UK or not?
00:52:18,00:52:19,- Americans just think we're a podcast
00:52:19,00:52:21,"of like, made up, imaginative."
00:52:21,00:52:22,(laughing)
00:52:22,00:52:24,- And does it also mean that people in the North
00:52:24,00:52:27,trust me better than they trust the rest of you?
00:52:27,00:52:28,"- Maybe, yeah."
00:52:28,00:52:30,- People and no one trusts Dan.
00:52:30,00:52:30,Is that?
00:52:30,00:52:33,"- I've got this, and it's hardly rightfully so."
00:52:33,00:52:35,(laughing)
00:52:35,00:52:38,It's a very rare case where they're totally justified.
00:52:38,00:52:38,- Wow.
00:52:38,00:52:42,- We actually had the naked mole rat thing
00:52:42,00:52:46,"for a while in English society, the death by accident thing."
00:52:46,00:52:48,"So in the 14th century,"
00:52:48,00:52:51,you could be asked how you pronounced bread and cheese
00:52:51,00:52:53,and beheaded if you did it wrong.
00:52:53,00:52:56,"Specifically, if you said it with a Flemish accent."
00:52:56,00:52:58,"So, and bizarrely then,"
00:52:58,00:52:59,so that was 14th century.
00:52:59,00:53:02,"And then in the 16th century in Friesland,"
00:53:02,00:53:04,anyone who pronounced bread and cheese
00:53:04,00:53:06,with a French accent was beheaded.
00:53:06,00:53:11,And this is all about people being kind of racist back then.
00:53:11,00:53:12,"Still, 'twas ever thus."
00:53:12,00:53:14,And this was in the 14th century
00:53:14,00:53:16,when the peasants revolt and the Flemish were associated
00:53:16,00:53:18,with being sort of merchants.
00:53:18,00:53:20,And they came from that part of the world
00:53:20,00:53:21,that was doing quite well
00:53:21,00:53:23,and the peasants weren't doing well.
00:53:23,00:53:25,"And so these mobs were got someone to say,"
00:53:25,00:53:27,"""Say bread and cheese."""
00:53:27,00:53:29,"And if they heard a hint of Flemish,"
00:53:29,00:53:34,"so a hint of like, I think it's brought and cause,"
00:53:34,00:53:38,"who knows how they were said 700 years ago,"
00:53:38,00:53:40,then you got your head off.
00:53:40,00:53:42,"- Wow, and that's a shibboleth, right?"
00:53:42,00:53:46,"- Exactly, yeah, yeah, it's like a shibboleth."
00:53:46,00:53:48,"Shibboleth, shit, I'm having beheaded."
00:53:48,00:53:51,"- There was a thing you were saying before, Andy,"
00:53:51,00:53:54,about how you have to change an accent
00:53:54,00:53:56,in order for people to understand
00:53:56,00:53:58,"for important moments, right?"
00:53:58,00:54:00,"It's not the same scenario, but in the business world,"
00:54:00,00:54:02,a lot of companies have been called out
00:54:02,00:54:03,because they've been doing things
00:54:03,00:54:06,that are called accent neutralization classes.
00:54:06,00:54:10,"And particularly in America and Tennessee at a nuclear lab,"
00:54:10,00:54:12,there was a course which was effectively
00:54:12,00:54:14,a Southern accent reduction
00:54:14,00:54:16,where they got all of the most Southern sounding employees
00:54:16,00:54:18,"together and said, ""We're gonna teach you"
00:54:18,00:54:21,"to soften your accent so that people can understand you."""
00:54:21,00:54:23,- I reckon if I was at a nuclear lab
00:54:23,00:54:26,"and anyone called it nuclear,"
00:54:26,00:54:27,"that's what people say, isn't it?"
00:54:27,00:54:29,"Nuclear instead of nuclear,"
00:54:29,00:54:31,I think I just wouldn't do what they said.
00:54:31,00:54:35,"So they said, ""Oh my God, the nuclear reactor"
00:54:35,00:54:37,"is about to blow, you need to turn this down."""
00:54:37,00:54:39,"I'd be like, ""Sorry, what reactor?"""
00:54:39,00:54:41,(all laughing)
00:54:41,00:54:42,- Handing them a pamphlet
00:54:42,00:54:44,to the accent neutralization classes.
00:54:44,00:54:46,(all laughing)
00:54:46,00:54:49,- Do you know the language that is most similar
00:54:49,00:54:51,genetically to English?
00:54:51,00:54:53,"This is kind of, we'll come back to accents."
00:54:53,00:54:54,This will weave back around.
00:54:54,00:54:58,- I would have said like German or Dutch maybe.
00:54:58,00:54:59,- That's pretty close.
00:54:59,00:55:01,This is Frisian.
00:55:01,00:55:05,"So this is, is the closest language to old English,"
00:55:05,00:55:06,we believe.
00:55:06,00:55:08,So basically it's genetically close
00:55:08,00:55:11,'cause we're mostly descended from Frisian.
00:55:11,00:55:14,And it's so Frisian is from like north of the Netherlands.
00:55:14,00:55:17,And one of the really cool things about it
00:55:17,00:55:19,"is that if you take an English sentence,"
00:55:19,00:55:22,"which is very full of old English words,"
00:55:22,00:55:24,so you don't have all of that poncy romance language stuff
00:55:24,00:55:26,"that came in with the French,"
00:55:26,00:55:28,then it suddenly can sound really similar
00:55:28,00:55:30,to this quite obscure language.
00:55:30,00:55:34,"So bread, butter and green cheese is good English"
00:55:34,00:55:37,and good Frisian is a sentence in English.
00:55:37,00:55:41,"And in Frisian, I can't say it very well,"
00:55:41,00:55:46,"but in Frisian it is bread, butter and green cheese"
00:55:46,00:55:50,is good Ingelsk and good Frisian.
00:55:50,00:55:53,"And sorry, if you're a Frisian speaker."
00:55:53,00:55:54,"- I mean, Anna, that just sounded like you"
00:55:54,00:55:56,after you've had a few drinks.
00:55:56,00:56:01,- I make so much sense to the Dutch though.
00:56:01,00:56:05,"- Okay, that's it."
00:56:05,00:56:06,That is all of our facts.
00:56:06,00:56:07,Thank you so much for listening.

00:56:41,00:56:53,- I've just realized that I had one other thing.
00:56:53,00:56:54,Ants do sleep.
00:56:54,00:56:56,"Sorry, I should have mentioned it."
00:56:56,00:56:57,Should I mention it?
00:56:57,00:56:58,- I don't believe you.
00:56:58,00:56:59,I do not believe you.
