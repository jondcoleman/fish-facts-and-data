1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
 Hi everybody, before we start this week's show, we all have an announcement for you.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,240
 Are we all gonna do it at once? Now let's do one word at a time.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,800
 Okay, brilliant. That'll be fun, you know, like that amazing improv game.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,440
 Oh, great, yeah.

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,960
 So I'll go first. We have...

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,680
 Written.

7
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:15,920
 A.

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,280
 New.

9
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:17,680
 Book.

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,400
 That's called...

11
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,440
 Oh, Jesus, come on, guys. Never mind. We've written the new book.

12
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,440
 It's called Funny You Should Ask. It's available in all shops. It's really good.

13
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,760
 If you're looking for a last-minute Christmas gift,

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,360
 I can't think of anything better, really.

15
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:36,880
 It is. It's sort of a compilation of the weirdest questions that might spring to your mind in your

16
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,080
 very bored moments, things you've always wondered, things you've never wondered,

17
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,240
 but now you're desperate to know the answer to, like,

18
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,680
 who would win in a race out of a human, a fish, or a mermaid?

19
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,120
 Or if I take a swan to the vet, does the queen have to pay?

20
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,680
 Yeah, if spiders can walk on the ceiling, why can't they get out of the bath?

21
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,840
 Huge question. Always wondered about that.

22
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,600
 Why does cat food come in beef and lamb flavours, but not mouse flavour?

23
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,800
 Such a good question.

24
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,120
 Yeah.

25
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,200
 Buy it for your cat as a Christmas present.

26
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,160
 Your cat wants to know.

27
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,920
 And this book, it's not just written by us for it.

28
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,200
 It's written by all the QILs, so a lot of the QILs that you'll know

29
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,360
 because they've come on here, like Alex and Anne,

30
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,200
 but loads of the other QILs that are just a complete mystery even to me,

31
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,360
 even though I've been working with them for many, many years.

32
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,240
 It's fun. It's a lovely blue colour and it's reasonably priced.

33
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,720
 It could not be the more perfect Christmas present

34
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,240
 to give you all the conversation you'll need.

35
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,040
 So get it for the facts, but mainly for the blue on the cover.

36
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,480
 And it's available in bookshops and on the internet.

37
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,000
 You know how to buy a book, do it.

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Funny you should ask by the QILs.

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,160
 OK, on with the podcast.

40
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:57,120
 Hello and welcome to another episode

41
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,400
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

42
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,520
 from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

43
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,720
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

44
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,840
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

45
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,960
 and James Harkin.

46
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,200
 And once again, we have gathered round the microphones

47
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,000
 with our four favourite facts from the last seven days.

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,640
 And in no particular order, here we go.

49
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,360
 Starting with you, Andy.

50
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,920
 My fact is, there is such a big market for fake letters by Abraham Lincoln

51
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,640
 that people have started selling fake fakes.

52
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,640
 Wow.

53
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,880
 Yeah. How cool is this?

54
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,440
 There's a big old market for fake letters of Abraham Lincoln.

55
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,600
 People, he died in 1865.

56
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,760
 And there were a load of scam artists in the 20s and 30s

57
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,560
 who started faking the letters and faking his signature,

58
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,360
 using old paper, all these amazing tactics they used.

59
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,720
 And those fake letters are now worth thousands of dollars

60
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,680
 in their own right.

61
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,040
 They've sold for thousands of dollars each.

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,400
 But obviously, that means there's a market.

63
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,880
 And so people have started forging forgeries.

64
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,120
 And is it like Chinese whispers,

65
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,720
 where the fake fake fakes look absolutely nothing

66
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,080
 like the original letters?

67
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,880
 It's just a picture of a horse's ass.

68
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,200
 Yeah, Abraham Lincoln letters.

69
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:21,440
 But so these fake fakes, they have to be attributed

70
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,440
 to the fake writer, right?

71
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,880
 So as in people who became famous in that period

72
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,520
 for having written these fake letters in themselves

73
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,520
 have become celebrities in that world,

74
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,480
 and then they're buying fakes of the fake forwarders one.

75
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,240
 It's not just a random fake.

76
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,920
 No, no, but also it's the fact

77
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,920
 that the real ones are so expensive.

78
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,880
 Is that right?

79
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,840
 Like, if you're a person with a normal income

80
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,640
 and you want to buy a Lincoln letter, you just can't afford it.

81
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,720
 So the next best thing is to buy a fake one.

82
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,080
 Yeah, exactly.

83
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,960
 Yeah. And the weird thing is,

84
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,080
 there are so many Abraham Lincoln memorabilia collectors

85
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,640
 in the USA.

86
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,240
 It seems to be the national pastime.

87
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,160
 I always thought it was American football,

88
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,120
 but I turned on the TV on Thanksgiving

89
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,200
 and it was just people passing around fake letters

90
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,160
 to each other.

91
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,080
 If you look closely at these stands

92
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,440
 in American football matches,

93
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,800
 they're all trading their Abraham Lincoln bits of beard.

94
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,560
 There are 15,000 collectors, apparently serious collectors

95
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,920
 of memorabilia, not just your fly-by-night amateurs.

96
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,360
 50,000, Jesus.

97
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,920
 Yeah, which is 1,000 more than there are books written about.

98
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,840
 Apparently, there have been 14,000 books

99
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,040
 written about Abraham Lincoln.

100
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,800
 Still a lot, isn't it?

101
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,000
 It's a record after Jesus and Napoleon, apparently.

102
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,280
 Really interesting.

103
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,920
 I saw it when we were in Washington, D.C.

104
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,280
 for our tour last year.

105
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,960
 I saw a huge pillar at the Ford Theatre

106
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,800
 where they have glued every single book

107
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,000
 that's been written about Lincoln,

108
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,680
 or at least as many as they could get,

109
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,160
 to a pillar that extends to about four floors.

110
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,880
 We should say the most famous faker is Joseph Cozy, right?

111
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,400
 And is it mostly his that are being sold that are being forged?

112
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,240
 So Joseph Cozy was sort of the big Lincoln faker

113
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,160
 who was kind of an amazing guy.

114
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,600
 So he started out.

115
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,560
 He went into the Library of Congress.

116
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,720
 He was really into American history and stuff.

117
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,520
 And then he saw a pay warrant

118
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,200
 that was endorsed by Benjamin Franklin.

119
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,400
 So he had his signature on it.

120
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,760
 This was in 1929, and the pay warrant was from 1786.

121
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,800
 And he took it.

122
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,560
 And his argument when he was caught

123
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,800
 was that the Library of Congress belongs to the people,

124
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,680
 and he's one of the people.

125
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,960
 So it's not actually stealing.

126
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,840
 Anyway.

127
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,920
 Oh, wow. That's a good argument.

128
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,560
 So he went to sell it to a dealer who told him it was fake.

129
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,160
 He knew it wasn't fake.

130
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,200
 So he basically devoted his life to making actual fakes

131
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,960
 to screw over these idiot dealers

132
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,080
 who couldn't tell the difference.

133
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,480
 Wow.

134
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,920
 I mean, that must have been pretty hard for him to go in and say,

135
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,760
 "No, it's not fake. I stole it from the Library of..."

136
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,040
 Yeah, actually, I did buy it from a dodgy guy on the phone.

137
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,200
 It's so weird.

138
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,720
 This relationship he had with his arch enemy

139
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,400
 is a bit like, you know, in superhero films,

140
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,440
 which I don't watch.

141
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,000
 They, I think, the superhero, often,

142
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,680
 as well as hating his arch enemy,

143
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,440
 has this weird grudging respect for him,

144
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,200
 and they'll have a chat at the end, you know,

145
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,640
 where they're bonding.

146
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,400
 It's kind of like that happens.

147
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,840
 He had that with William Burquist,

148
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,560
 who was the investigator for the New York Public Library.

149
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,800
 And it was him who spotted in 1933

150
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,040
 something dodgy was going on with the documents,

151
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,120
 set up this big sting operation,

152
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,360
 caught Cosy as he was trying to, like, escape

153
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,120
 getting away with forging stuff,

154
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,880
 and basically congratulated him,

155
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,040
 brought him down to the police station, said, "You're a genius."

156
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,600
 And Cosy immediately was like, "Oh, thanks.

157
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,800
 Well, you should see what I've done with this,"

158
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,960
 and pulled some little forgeries out of his pocket.

159
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,400
 I was like, "Look at this."

160
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,280
 And Burquist was like,

161
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,760
 "Look, employ your talents better in future, please.

162
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,600
 Don't do it again. Off you go."

163
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,560
 And Cosy disappeared,

164
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,360
 and immediately started forging loads and loads of stuff again.

165
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,040
 But they sort of hung out,

166
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,600
 as well as Burquist trying to stop these forgeries

167
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,440
 getting into the market and trying to suppress him.

168
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,320
 They also, like, paid each other social calls sometimes.

169
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,240
 He would occasionally give Cosy a bit of money

170
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,520
 to help him on his way.

171
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,880
 -Wow. -It's very weird.

172
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,000
 All right, it's weird.

173
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,840
 Do you know how Cosy got started?

174
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,440
 He got... He was in the Army originally.

175
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,080
 Not originally.

176
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,280
 He joined the Army as a young man, I guess.

177
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:07,920
 Not as a baby.

178
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,080
 Look, anyway, he got started...

179
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,640
 That's why they call it the infantry, isn't it?

180
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,840
 (LAUGHS)

181
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:20,400
 He got kicked out of the Army for assaulting a cook in his company.

182
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,760
 I don't know why he assaulted the cook,

183
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,520
 but he forged a certificate of honourable discharge from the Army

184
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,920
 because he was obviously dishonorably discharged.

185
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,200
 And so that was, I think,

186
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,400
 one of his first steps on the road to forging all this other stuff.

187
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,280
 Yes, but he signed it as Abraham Lincoln, which was a bit confusing.

188
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,120
 He never really made money from it.

189
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,640
 He sold stuff quite cheap.

190
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,080
 I think Cosy was nervous

191
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,480
 that if he tried to sell it really expensively,

192
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,480
 people would interrogate it more.

193
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,920
 So he'd sell it quite cheap.

194
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,520
 And he said when he was questioned,

195
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,520
 the pleasure that he got was from seeing that forgery that he sold

196
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,600
 climbing up and up the auction market

197
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,640
 and then selling for a huge amount in an auction house,

198
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,920
 him sitting there at home, you know, tapping his fingers together,

199
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,760
 going, "Oh, I know that's just something I scribbled in my bathroom."

200
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,560
 Yeah.

201
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,960
 And he had a little bit of a loophole, didn't he?

202
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,040
 Because he, in New York,

203
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,640
 it was illegal to kind of advertise something as being something it wasn't

204
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,920
 and then selling it on.

205
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,520
 But if you went to someone and just said,

206
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,400
 "Oh, I found this scribbled signature.

207
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,000
 I don't know who it's by.

208
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,040
 I don't know what it's on.

209
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,920
 I know it says Abraham Lincoln, but I don't know who did it."

210
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,600
 Then, and you sold it to them,

211
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,280
 then technically that wasn't a felony.

212
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,040
 So that's so clever.

213
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,000
 Yeah.

214
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,960
 Well, we don't know.

215
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,480
 He might, I don't think he is,

216
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,880
 but there's a suggestion that he kept operating

217
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,120
 for years and years after he went able

218
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,200
 because he kind of dropped off the radar in 1943.

219
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,800
 But even in 1956,

220
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,400
 the New Yorker wrote a piece saying,

221
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,840
 "Is he still producing forgeries?

222
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,960
 We don't know."

223
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,840
 So you're saying he could,

224
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,600
 were you about to say he might still be around today

225
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,200
 if you've actually got a signed copy

226
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,800
 of a "Know Such Things as a Fish" book?

227
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,160
 Check it out, Joseph Cosy.

228
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,680
 Do you know how you can tell if a Lincoln letter is fake?

229
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,600
 No. How can you do that?

230
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,800
 Oh, there are so many exciting ways you can tell.

231
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,560
 So one is what he wrote.

232
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,600
 So if...

233
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,040
 If he's talking about his iPad.

234
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,600
 That basically is one of the tips they give,

235
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,040
 is what he, you know,

236
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,480
 is it signed 1866 or later, in which case it's not real.

237
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,840
 But another thing is just what he signed.

238
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:29,280
 So he never, ever signed Abe or Honest Abe or Old Abe.

239
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,200
 That's just...

240
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,880
 Oh, the Abe Meister.

241
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,520
 Exactly.

242
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,680
 It's either Abe Lincoln on letters,

243
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,080
 or if he was a lawyer, he would just sign Lincoln.

244
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,040
 So there are all these things.

245
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,360
 Also, if you wrote a letter on animal skin, then it's fake.

246
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:45,520
 Oh, really?

247
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,960
 Because a lot of presidential documents

248
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,480
 are on animal skin, or vellum,

249
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,000
 and their letters are on paper.

250
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,040
 That's another way you can tell.

251
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,920
 Oh, it wasn't like he was an early animal rights campaigner

252
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,560
 or anything.

253
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,160
 You know, we shouldn't be using the animals for honest.

254
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,040
 Absolutely not.

255
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,680
 No.

256
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,960
 Do you guys see that,

257
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,800
 I think it was only in the last month or so,

258
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,760
 they sold a lock of Lincoln's hair for $50,000.

259
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,640
 Wow.

260
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,000
 Although, there is a thing about fake locks of hair.

261
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,920
 We do know that quite a lot of them exist,

262
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,920
 because one collector said,

263
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,320
 "If every lock of Lincoln's hair out there was genuine,

264
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,840
 the man would have been a wooly mammoth."

265
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,880
 I'm not quite sure what the provenance of this is.

266
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,000
 $50,000.

267
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,200
 Yeah, that's amazing.

268
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,240
 I went on eBay to look at what the most expensive items

269
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,600
 currently on eBay are that you can buy that are related to Lincoln.

270
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,160
 And hair is a big, big thing.

271
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,360
 So there's strands of hair that you could buy of Lincoln,

272
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,800
 and they're all quite affordable.

273
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,000
 I found one for £636 that you could buy.

274
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,120
 I found an exciting,

275
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,960
 well, the more exciting one is the bundle that I found.

276
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:48,960
 It's for his son.

277
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,400
 It's for his baby son, all right?

278
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,480
 That's not for Dan.

279
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,600
 I'm more interested in this one for $1,500.

280
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,720
 You can get a bundle of Lincoln, Geronimo, Lord Nelson,

281
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,560
 and King George's hair for $1,500, which is exciting.

282
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,400
 And then twice them all together.

283
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,160
 No, they're four separate cards.

284
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,800
 Oh, that's true.

285
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,160
 Yeah, you could have the ultimate wig,

286
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,600
 the ultimate historical wig.

287
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,880
 I don't think this one's real, I have to say.

288
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,640
 The other things that this guy's selling is,

289
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,400
 you know, Tiger King, Joe Exotic.

290
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,560
 He's selling premium condoms of this guy's.

291
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,320
 So it's a big premium condoms of this guy's.

292
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,280
 Do you mean...

293
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,720
 I know, because I only thought he did the basic condoms.

294
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,200
 I'm a bit annoyed that I've been buying

295
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,040
 the wrong Joe Exotic condoms now.

296
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,800
 I don't know Tiger King, Joe Exotic,

297
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,400
 but I don't think I need to.

298
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,080
 Oh, OK, it was a bit bigger.

299
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,680
 Imagine the superhero movie,

300
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,080
 where you've got one superhero who keeps tigers

301
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,280
 and another superhero who's a woman who also keeps tigers,

302
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,120
 and they kind of have a grudging respect

303
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,120
 for each other, apart from they don't really.

304
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,120
 Then that's pretty much where you are.

305
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,400
 Sounds amazing, thanks.

306
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:52,960
 I'll watch it off.

307
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,520
 Yeah, it's huge.

308
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,760
 I'm just on Lincoln Letters.

309
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,080
 Did you know that whenever he wrote a letter

310
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,240
 that was a bit angry or telling someone off

311
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,680
 or disagreeing with someone,

312
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,800
 as soon as he'd written it,

313
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,640
 he put it in a locked drawer overnight?

314
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,760
 The equivalent of not sending your email

315
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,360
 until the next morning.

316
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,000
 That's clever.

317
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,720
 That's hot.

318
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,040
 Yeah.

319
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,760
 That's a really good idea.

320
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,560
 Yeah, it's good stuff.

321
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,160
 Yeah, you should do that more often, Andy.

322
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,160
 I stand by everything I said in that letter to you, I know.

323
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,760
 I mean, Andy goes to bed at half-night every night.

324
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,600
 It's not like that.

325
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,720
 There's 915 drunken emails from him though, too much.

326
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,520
 Did you guys know that Abraham Lincoln's hair

327
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,920
 went to the inauguration of Teddy Roosevelt?

328
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,440
 I didn't know that.

329
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,560
 Yeah, so he was handed a ring by John Hay,

330
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,560
 who was the Secretary of State for Roosevelt.

331
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,800
 But he was also Lincoln's personal secretary

332
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,480
 between 1861 and '65.

333
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,120
 He had a strand of Lincoln's hair,

334
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,640
 and he put it into a ring.

335
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,040
 And the ring was worn by Teddy Roosevelt

336
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,320
 on the day that he was inaugurated in 1905 as president.

337
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,600
 Yeah, so Lincoln was there.

338
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,360
 Did they do that kind of something old,

339
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,960
 something new, something borrowed, something blue?

340
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,440
 That's right.

341
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,000
 The day.

342
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,560
 Exactly.

343
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,440
 Lincoln related.

344
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,680
 For the next inauguration, it's going to be

345
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,560
 Donald Trump's hair that's going to be worn.

346
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,640
 And the something old is the actual president.

347
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:12,880
 Yeah.

348
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,280
 Something orange.

349
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:19,840
 Speaking of Donald Trump, at the time of recording,

350
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,360
 he still hasn't left the White House,

351
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,040
 and I'm assuming he probably won't have done that.

352
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,040
 We can put this out anytime now, anytime.

353
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,440
 Do you know someone else who refused to leave the White House

354
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,040
 was Mary Todd Lincoln?

355
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,080
 Really?

356
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,560
 Yeah.

357
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,480
 So when Abraham Lincoln died,

358
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,160
 obviously it was, you know, extremely distressing for her.

359
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,280
 She was inconsolable.

360
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,200
 She locked herself into the White House,

361
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,280
 and Andrew Johnson couldn't move in.

362
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,160
 And so Andrew Johnson became president on April the 15th,

363
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,880
 and he couldn't move into the White House until May the 26th,

364
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,960
 because Mary Todd Lincoln just refused to leave.

365
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,440
 You can buy her opera glasses.

366
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,160
 You can't buy them.

367
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,240
 Actually, no, there isn't one pair.

368
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,280
 This is the problem.

369
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,000
 So there is a pair of opera glasses, which ivory,

370
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,200
 and they were engraved.

371
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,320
 Mary Lincoln left these glasses in the box at Ford's Theatre

372
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,920
 Good Friday, April 14th, when our president and leader

373
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,880
 was cruelly assassinated.

374
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,720
 They sold for £9,000 last year,

375
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,200
 but there are at least three pairs of Abraham Lincoln's

376
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,960
 opera glasses in circulation,

377
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,520
 which does make you consider just how keen was he

378
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,480
 on seeing this play?

379
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,320
 Well, it's so good for the collectors

380
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,760
 of the weird paraphernalia,

381
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,840
 which is a lot of it is around the assassination, isn't it?

382
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,760
 People collecting stuff that was at the theatre.

383
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,400
 And it's great for them that Abraham Lincoln seemed to stuff

384
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,360
 his pockets with stuff.

385
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,040
 There's a collection.

386
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,080
 I think it's in the Library of Congress,

387
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,320
 and it's the contents of Abraham Lincoln's pockets

388
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,840
 on the night of the assassination.

389
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,560
 It's just full.

390
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,560
 I don't know how big pockets were in those days,

391
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,400
 but that was two pairs of glasses, I guess.

392
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,400
 You lose one while you're sitting there watching the opera.

393
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,520
 You've got a second.

394
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,520
 One of them was mended with string, I guess,

395
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,040
 because he's such a humble guy,

396
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,680
 such a kind of Jeremy Corbyn-style leader,

397
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,880
 having glasses taped together.

398
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,640
 Well, like Jack Duckworth, I think.

399
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,720
 Jack Duckworth.

400
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,480
 Sorry, that's a coronation.

401
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,360
 It's a superhero.

402
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:09,920
 It's a superhero.

403
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,480
 It's a superhero.

404
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,800
 He becomes Duck Man at times of great stress.

405
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,080
 He was carrying a pocket knife,

406
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,200
 which I think is so painful,

407
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,120
 because he could have whipped that out and defended himself

408
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,720
 had he not been shot in the back of that.

409
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,080
 He would have literally been bringing a knife

410
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,040
 to a gunfight, hadn't he?

411
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,040
 [laughter]

412
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:34,000
 OK, it is time for fact number two,

413
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,760
 and that is James.

414
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,440
 OK, my fact this week is that if you ask someone what day it is,

415
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,160
 they'll take twice as long to answer on a Wednesday

416
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,240
 as they would on a Monday or Friday.

417
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,000
 And that's because by Wednesday,

418
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,320
 you literally have no idea what day it is.

419
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,520
 Does this data take into account everyone working at home

420
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,160
 and having no idea at all?

421
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,600
 We might come to that later.

422
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,320
 Oh, OK.

423
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,000
 But let me quickly explain this study very quickly.

424
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,280
 So this is a 2015 study by David A. Ellis,

425
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,880
 Richard Wiseman, and Rob Jenkins.

426
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,000
 And they asked people what day is it?

427
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,680
 That's the first thing that they asked.

428
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,240
 And they timed how long it took people to respond.

429
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,320
 And most of the differences

430
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,880
 were not really significant statistically,

431
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,640
 but they did find the statistical difference

432
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,800
 between Monday and Wednesday,

433
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,600
 which was it took just over half a second for people to say,

434
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,280
 well, it's Monday, obviously.

435
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:31,200
 And it took about a second and a half just under for people to go,

436
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,080
 it's Wednesday.

437
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,240
 And the same was between Wednesday and Friday.

438
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,880
 But none of the other comparisons were kind of significant.

439
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,040
 And they reckon that it's because Monday is a really depressing day

440
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,400
 because the week starts in.

441
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,920
 Friday is the exciting day because it's the new Monday.

442
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,800
 And then in the middle, they all kind of come together.

443
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,320
 And that's what they think.

444
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,240
 Friday is really exciting

445
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,160
 because I get to go to bed at 10 o'clock on Friday.

446
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:02,640
 James, when they did the survey, when they were asking people,

447
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,720
 did they kind of dress up the actual survey

448
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,120
 as just a bit of form filling in before the experiment began?

449
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,800
 So they said, all right, let's just get you logged in.

450
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,680
 So what day is it?

451
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,800
 And then timed them.

452
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,680
 You're smashing it.

453
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,120
 You would be at scientists.

454
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,080
 Yeah, that's what they did.

455
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,880
 They didn't tell people what the study was about.

456
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,400
 And they said, OK, first of all, what day do you think it is?

457
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,360
 That's so funny.

458
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,440
 But then did they ask them to leave straight away?

459
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,840
 Because you'd really think you'd absolutely failed that initial question.

460
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,800
 Yes, out.

461
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,760
 OK, you can go.

462
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,280
 The whole rest of the day, you'd be going,

463
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,400
 fuck, is it Thursday?

464
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,920
 That's a Tuesday?

465
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,720
 But you'd kind of know it, though,

466
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,560
 because if you had to go in for a survey,

467
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,600
 I'd be in the preceding week going, oh, god, I remember,

468
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,880
 I've got that survey on Wednesday.

469
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,400
 What are you doing on Wednesday?

470
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,000
 I've got to go and do the survey.

471
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,360
 That would be at the forefront of my mind.

472
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,320
 That's a really good point.

473
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,480
 I'm not sure in the study, if they thought about that,

474
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,400
 were actually the fact that they're doing the study affects the result.

475
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,160
 I suppose it does in a way like you say.

476
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:54,560
 Yeah.

477
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,320
 So the difference might be even greater.

478
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:56,640
 The difference.

479
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,440
 Would have thought.

480
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,200
 Yeah, could be, could be.

481
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,720
 But during lockdown, there was a study done in America.

482
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,880
 This was by the Southwest News Service.

483
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,880
 And they asked people what day it was.

484
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,240
 And 59% of people said they were unsure what day it was.

485
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:10,800
 And that was the show.

486
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,200
 Wow.

487
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,680
 Most people didn't know what month it was this year.

488
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:17,360
 I'm not sure how scientific that one was.

489
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,080
 And there was another study with a different set of people

490
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,760
 which says what days it feel like.

491
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:26,080
 And they found that usually people kind of got it right.

492
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,800
 But mismatches were 52.2% during a bank holiday.

493
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,560
 So more than half of people in a bank holiday week

494
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,760
 will not be quite sure.

495
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,280
 Or will think it feels like a different day

496
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,560
 than it actually feels like.

497
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,200
 Which I think is right.

498
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,080
 I agree with that, Steve.

499
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,680
 I definitely have that, yeah.

500
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,160
 Yeah.

501
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:42,720
 Yeah.

502
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,080
 People, it's because, and they've theorised that it's because

503
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,120
 certain days have stronger.

504
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,800
 Identities than others.

505
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,280
 Don't know as well.

506
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,960
 They said, which is really sad for some of the real

507
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,120
 personality list days in the middle of the week.

508
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,360
 But I think in the follow up study,

509
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,360
 which was also David Ellis and Co.

510
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,520
 They asked people for the words they associate most

511
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,720
 with certain days.

512
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,520
 It's very predictable.

513
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,840
 It's Monday is words like boredom, tiredness, and rubbish.

514
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,960
 Friday is fun, friends, party, and bacon, apparently.

515
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,560
 One of them is pop words.

516
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,120
 I mean, is there a big tradition of bacon Fridays?

517
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,160
 I don't know about.

518
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:14,880
 I think there is.

519
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,240
 I was going to say in my family, because I grew up in a

520
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,000
 Catholic family, we weren't allowed to meet or we weren't

521
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,600
 supposed to have meat on Fridays.

522
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,640
 I mean, maybe that's why you're thinking about it so much

523
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:24,960
 though.

524
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,160
 Yes, I could really do with a bacon Saturday.

525
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,720
 Yeah, I think maybe I definitely, this is anecdote now,

526
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,960
 not data, but I definitely would allow myself to have a

527
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,760
 bacon sandwich on a Friday, which is a bit really less

528
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,520
 healthy than obviously the grains and vegetables I

529
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,640
 normally consume.

530
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,000
 Such a scar.

531
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,200
 Insight into your unbelievably weird mind, Andy.

532
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:51,760
 Friday.

533
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,680
 Friday is a huge day for you, isn't it, Andy?

534
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,640
 Bacon sandwich in the morning, 10 p.m. bed time.

535
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,960
 My God, you're off the chain.

536
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,520
 You probably got to bed early on a Thursday thinking,

537
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,920
 well, I'm really looking forward to getting up for next

538
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,760
 morning like kids on Christmas Eve.

539
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,320
 I want to maximise the Friday awakeness, yeah.

540
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,840
 Actually, this is a thing where people are more concerned

541
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,560
 with their health on a Monday than any other day of the week.

542
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:18,560
 So just if you look at Google searches, people search for

543
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,760
 health-related things, you know, how to stop smoking or

544
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,560
 starting a diet or making a doctor's appointment.

545
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,840
 They do that 80% more on a Monday than on a Saturday.

546
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,000
 No one on a Saturday is searching how to give up smoking.

547
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,600
 We've all got our bacon hangover that we're trying to get out of.

548
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,720
 There are certain countries and cultures that make it a lot

549
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,800
 easier for you to remember what day it is.

550
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,560
 So in Thailand, they used to do a thing where they would dress

551
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,920
 in the colour of the day.

552
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,080
 So every day is assigned a colour.

553
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,840
 Sunday red, Monday yellow, Tuesday pink, Wednesday green,

554
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,480
 Thursday orange, Friday blue, Saturday purple.

555
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,240
 And those colours were all to do with Hindu astrological

556
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,040
 influences and the colour was given to each one of them.

557
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,200
 So you would go out of your house and you would wear

558
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,120
 if it was a Monday yellow.

559
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,680
 Everyone would be wearing yellow on a Monday.

560
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,920
 This is, yeah, this is a while ago.

561
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,720
 So, and it might be that you would have a statement piece

562
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,960
 on you that was yellow just to represent it.

563
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,560
 And nowadays, because everyone knows their own colour

564
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,240
 because they're born on one of those days,

565
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,640
 they have a personal colour, that becomes their colour.

566
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,120
 So more often than not, you'll see that as a prominent colour

567
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,560
 on someone in Thailand.

568
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,440
 And you can go, oh, you were born on a Wednesday or so on.

569
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,640
 That's amazing.

570
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,960
 But then if it's a bank holiday, do you turn up on the

571
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,200
 green day wearing something blue and everyone's like...

572
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,200
 Oh, it's so embarrassing.

573
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,760
 It's like turning up to non-uniform day,

574
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,720
 forgetting that it's happened and wearing a uniform, isn't it?

575
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,320
 Oh, God, it's the stuff of nightmares.

576
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,720
 I know what our colours are for all four of us here.

577
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,600
 Oh, yeah.

578
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,360
 Of what day we were born on.

579
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,640
 So, Anna, you're blue.

580
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,760
 You were born on a Friday.

581
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,880
 Who was I now?

582
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,760
 Yeah, James, you were blue.

583
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,800
 You were born on a Friday.

584
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,400
 Hey, we're blue twins.

585
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,440
 Yeah.

586
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,800
 And I am a blue.

587
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,640
 Hey, we're blue triplets.

588
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,600
 Nice one.

589
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,480
 This is so nice and cosy, and we're all friends.

590
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,160
 And we're all the same colour.

591
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,040
 We're all meant to be.

592
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,960
 It's like we've been chosen by the university.

593
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,000
 What day was I born?

594
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,800
 Then?

595
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,760
 You're purple.

596
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,560
 You're a Saturday.

597
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,520
 You're the ticky week you have to go.

598
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:26,240
 But we are now auditioning for someone to join the podcast

599
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,360
 who was born on a Friday.

600
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,800
 So if that's you, get in touch.

601
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,240
 Do you know someone whose middle name is Friday?

602
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,240
 Ooh.

603
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,280
 Is it someone really famous?

604
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:35,840
 I think that.

605
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,800
 No, I do. I do.

606
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,040
 But only because of research, but let's pretend I don't.

607
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,160
 Yeah, yeah.

608
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,000
 It's someone, it's a fictional character.

609
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,400
 It's not, I know the horse in that riddle's first name is Friday.

610
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,160
 That's different, isn't it?

611
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,600
 He rode in on a Friday.

612
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:49,920
 Yeah.

613
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,560
 It's not Man Friday, is it?

614
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,680
 Man Friday.

615
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,440
 So he'd be called Friday, Friday.

616
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,640
 Friday was his middle name.

617
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,600
 But it's someone whose first name is a day of the week.

618
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,560
 So...

619
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,520
 Wednesday Adams.

620
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,640
 Wednesday Adams.

621
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,400
 So her middle name is Friday.

622
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,960
 And the reason that she's called Wednesday,

623
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,080
 I mean, I know Dan knows.

624
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,520
 Anyone know why she's called Wednesday?

625
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,800
 It's because Wednesday's child is full of woe,

626
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,440
 according to that rhyme.

627
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,320
 And so she was like the sad child.

628
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,520
 She was miserable.

629
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:21,760
 Yeah.

630
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,560
 In Ghana, you are named after the day of the week you're born on.

631
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:34,720
 So boys are named Kwadwo, Komla, Kwaku, Yor, Kofi, Kwami, Kwazi

632
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,600
 after the days of the week.

633
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,600
 And girls, they're a female equivalent of two,

634
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:42,880
 Adzoa, Abena, Aqwa, Ya, Fue, Amma and Aqosua.

635
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,280
 And you get that name when you're born.

636
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,880
 And then you get another name a bit later on,

637
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,600
 but you keep your day name and it becomes your middle name.

638
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,160
 So you can tell from a birth certificate in Ghana what day it's born.

639
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:52,960
 Did you say Kofi?

640
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,320
 Is Kofi anan one of those?

641
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,520
 Maske.

642
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,720
 Yeah, I guess Kofi is.

643
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,760
 Kofi is one of the names.

644
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,600
 That's the fifth of the list.

645
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,320
 Yeah.

646
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,520
 You just said, Andy, that you could know from a birth certificate

647
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,800
 what day the person was born.

648
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,760
 I hope I'm not saying it down.

649
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:11,360
 I was hoping we, I was hoping I'd slit that one past you.

650
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,360
 Typical, typical purple comment.

651
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:23,120
 I looked a bit into Wednesday specifically,

652
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,360
 because it's this underappreciated today.

653
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:30,480
 And I like the sort of stuff about the word Wednesday.

654
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,320
 It's basically the wrong word.

655
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,240
 So I've decided we should rename Wednesday.

656
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,880
 It's named after Odin, who was called Woden,

657
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,200
 who is the early Norse god.

658
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,640
 And it was named that because it was thought to be a parallel to Mercury,

659
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,280
 which is what so, Mercury and all those Romance languages,

660
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,040
 Wednesday is named after Mercury, the god.

661
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:54,720
 But I've recently been listening to the excellent audio book on Norse gods

662
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,920
 by Neil Gaiman.

663
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,120
 And Odin is nothing like Mercury.

664
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:04,880
 So Mercury is like a fun loving trickster, playful, wily.

665
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,000
 Odin's not like that.

666
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,920
 I think it should be Loki.

667
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,760
 So I'm going to start calling Wednesday Loki,

668
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,120
 and everyone's going to get confused.

669
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,280
 But the person who decided that it should be the equivalent,

670
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,880
 it should be Odin, was Tacitus.

671
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,640
 And this is in the first century.

672
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,240
 And it was when the Romans were kind of occupying bits of Germania,

673
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,680
 as it was called at the time.

674
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,840
 And he decided Odin was the equivalent.

675
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,000
 And it was because, and I just love this word,

676
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,600
 they're both psychopomps, Odin and Mercury.

677
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,640
 And a psychopomp, again a word I'm going to use a lot now,

678
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,120
 is the word for a deity who escorts people from Earth to the afterlife when they die.

679
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,160
 Wow.

680
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,920
 So that's a psychopomp.

681
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,280
 That's a great word.

682
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:47,600
 I thought that, let's say we're going to accept that it's Odin's day,

683
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,600
 rather than Loki's day.

684
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,640
 Let's just imagine that that's fine, which we all know now it isn't.

685
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,440
 From this moment, we are all calling it Loki's day.

686
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,120
 But let's imagine it was Odin's day.

687
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,000
 Why is it not Odin's day?

688
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,440
 Why is it Odin's day?

689
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,640
 Like, it's because it was another name that was used in Germanic areas for Odin.

690
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,440
 But Odin had more than 150 different names,

691
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,200
 any one of which we could have chosen for Wednesday instead of Odin.

692
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,960
 So we could have had Grim's day, a Grim day.

693
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,960
 Like for Wednesday, we could have had Skillfinger day.

694
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,960
 That would have been good.

695
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,320
 We could have had Sada, Sada day.

696
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,240
 But I guess that was a bit too close to Saturday,

697
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,920
 so I decided not to go for it.

698
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,720
 That's great.

699
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,120
 But yeah.

700
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,200
 That's Skillfinger day.

701
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:33,920
 I take it back.

702
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,800
 It shouldn't be Loki's day.

703
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,000
 Let's call it Skillfinger day.

704
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,880
 Skillfinger day.

705
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,720
 I love that.

706
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,720
 That's so good.

707
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,320
 Hey, what's your favourite day of the week, guys?

708
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,400
 It's obviously Friday.

709
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,520
 Thursday.

710
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,800
 Oh, Dan, you nerd.

711
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,960
 Is it Thursday because we record the podcast on a Thursday?

712
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,640
 This is the highlight of your week.

713
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,160
 That's the best moment of my whole life.

714
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,840
 No, I like the number four.

715
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,800
 Four is my favourite number.

716
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,320
 And so that's the fourth day of the week to my week schedule.

717
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,080
 I know Sunday is technically the first day,

718
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,440
 so it should be Wednesday.

719
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:03,840
 James.

720
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,720
 Yeah.

721
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,520
 I think Monday is the first day officially,

722
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,920
 according to the International Standards Organization.

723
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,320
 So I think you're fine with having Thursday.

724
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,160
 In Russian, Thursday is Chepyorka,

725
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,840
 which means like fourth day.

726
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,280
 So it works there as well.

727
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,600
 My favourite, I think, probably Saturday,

728
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,280
 where I can just chill out and watch the football.

729
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,480
 OK, everyone's got good answers here,

730
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,280
 apart from Dan, whose answer is very weird, statistically.

731
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:33,760
 So 21% of young people say that Friday is their favourite day.

732
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,520
 Only 6% of young people like Sundays.

733
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,440
 And I think that rises as you get older.

734
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,120
 You start to appreciate Sunday a bit more.

735
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,320
 You're off the bacon binges.

736
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,600
 But Tuesday is just 1% of people's favourite day.

737
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,920
 And I think Thursday might be another 1%.

738
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,760
 It scores very low.

739
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,680
 Do you know why no one likes Tuesday?

740
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,560
 Because we were saying that Wednesday was named after Odin.

741
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,480
 And Odin was a pretty cool god, right?

742
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,000
 He was the king of the gods and stuff.

743
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,600
 Do you know who Tuesday was named after?

744
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,480
 No.

745
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,720
 Tuesday was named after a god called Tia,

746
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,600
 who is one of the most obscure gods.

747
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,480
 We have literally no idea anything about this guy.

748
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,040
 We only have one myth of him that's left.

749
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,960
 We don't really know anything about him at all.

750
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,920
 And there was a wolf, who was a baby wolf,

751
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,600
 but it was growing really, really quickly.

752
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,640
 And the gods were worried that this wolf was going to get so big,

753
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,760
 he was going to eat them all.

754
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,640
 And so they said, right, we're going to have to tie him down.

755
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,560
 So we're going to tie him in a load of ropes and stuff,

756
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,640
 and like magic god chains.

757
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,080
 But when Fenrir the wolf saw the chains,

758
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,720
 he didn't trust that anything was going to happen.

759
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,960
 So he said, OK, well, I'll kind of come and say hi.

760
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,840
 But only if one of you puts your arm down my throat,

761
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,440
 because then I'll trust that you're not going to chain me up.

762
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,720
 And so Tia, the god, who Tuesday's named after,

763
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,800
 decided, OK, well, in good faith,

764
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,440
 I'll be the one who puts my arm down your throat.

765
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,280
 And then, of course, they chain the wolf up

766
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,480
 and the wolf bit his arm off.

767
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,840
 That's the only story we have about the guy who Tuesday's named after.

768
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,200
 It's such an important moral to that story.

769
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,960
 Don't put your arm down a wolf's throat.

770
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,720
 That is an important lesson.

771
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,160
 Yeah, that's true.

772
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,040
 Yes.

773
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,200
 Without that, wolf arm casualties

774
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,640
 would be way higher than they are.

775
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,680
 I've got one last thing before we move on,

776
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:27,600
 which is, remember, we were talking about that one dickhead

777
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:33,840
 who gets the colour on as they rock up to a sort of school in Thailand?

778
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,760
 I'm afraid I'm that dickhead.

779
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,000
 What?

780
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,080
 Because I was born on a Saturday, it turns out.

781
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,240
 Where are you? So what colour are you?

782
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,920
 I'm purple. I'm with Andy.

783
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,320
 Welcome, Ben.

784
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,760
 You traitor.

785
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,960
 I can't believe it.

786
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,240
 Have you just been doubled?

787
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,680
 Did you have a feeling, as you said that?

788
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,600
 I bet I've got that wrong, as well, since I've done anything wrong.

789
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,880
 Oh, we just tried to get in Mayan and Anna's cool club

790
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,320
 by pretending to be a blue.

791
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,640
 I was trying to be a blue, yeah.

792
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,440
 Yeah. No, I had a weird feeling come over me.

793
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,640
 I thought, "I don't feel very blue."

794
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,960
 I had a quick Google, it turns out.

795
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,560
 I mean, it's so in line with my facts.

796
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:17,040
 Is this a situation where your whole life you thought you were born on a Friday

797
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,480
 and you've only just realised?

798
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,080
 Or was it a fact that you thought,

799
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,760
 "I know what day I was born, I'm going to Google it,"

800
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,360
 and you just got the wrong answer on Google?

801
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:23,920
 Oh, which one?

802
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,360
 I got the wrong answer on Google, yeah.

803
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,880
 I double checked it on a different site,

804
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,480
 just as we were talking, because it just felt wrong.

805
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,440
 And I had a memory, just a memory of Saturday.

806
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,600
 I remember seeing the newspaper as I came out.

807
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,280
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Anna.

808
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:49,760
 My fact this week is that according to Vietnamese historians,

809
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,920
 Chinese forces were once defeated by a woman who had breast so long

810
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,400
 she had to throw them over her shoulders in battle.

811
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:02,160
 And this is, I think this is the second part we've had on the podcast about

812
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,960
 women with breast so long they had to throw them over their shoulders.

813
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,080
 One was a yeti.

814
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,360
 Yeah, one's a yeti.

815
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,080
 Female yeti.

816
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,040
 They have to throw them over their shoulders before they chase you

817
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,280
 or they might trip on them and throw it themselves.

818
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,240
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

819
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,120
 Possibly.

820
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,480
 Can I ask, is this lady as real as a yeti?

821
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,360
 I would say she's more real than a yeti.

822
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,400
 So I'm going to say this fact is less of a nonsense fact than Dan's

823
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,360
 because it's recorded by historians,

824
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,080
 and it's about almost certainly historical figure.

825
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,840
 But I still find it hard to believe that this breast thing actually happened,

826
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,480
 but this, so this is this warrior called Lady Chu, or Lady Trieu,

827
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,760
 as we'd anglicise it.

828
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,440
 And she is amazing.

829
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,880
 And she's a hero in Vietnam.

830
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:48,240
 In the third century, she led this revolt against the invading Chinese Wu state.

831
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,440
 And the writing about her from almost contemporary said that she was this

832
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,440
 extraordinary figure and her features included four foot long breasts,

833
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,160
 which either she tossed over her shoulders to get them out the way,

834
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,760
 or sometimes she tied them to her torso so they didn't get out the way of her.

835
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,360
 It's interesting because I read in one account that they said that she had

836
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,600
 three breasts that were four feet long.

837
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,240
 Yes.

838
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,040
 So I can imagine how two of them can be throttled over the shoulder,

839
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,880
 but the other one's going to hit you in the face, isn't it?

840
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,160
 When you... It is.

841
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:16,320
 Yeah.

842
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,160
 Maybe that's the one she strapped her stomach.

843
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:18,240
 Maybe.

844
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,320
 Because, yeah, I've seen a painting of her with the third,

845
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,320
 sneaky third breast hanging down there.

846
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,560
 OK, so we're not disputing the length of the boobs.

847
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,480
 We've actually just cracked that she had three,

848
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,000
 and both of these points about going over the shoulders and around the stomach are true.

849
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,640
 Well, also...

850
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,360
 That's exciting.

851
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,360
 Nine feet tall was the other thing as well.

852
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,200
 So I think, you know...

853
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,040
 Yeah, this is a sort of tradition in Vietnam where some

854
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,760
 historic warriors take on this mythical status,

855
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,280
 and then they are written up as becoming more and more godlike.

856
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,520
 So, yeah, she was written up as being nine feet tall.

857
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,440
 She could walk over 1,000 miles in a day.

858
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,800
 But there are various things we think she probably did do,

859
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,880
 like rode elephants into battle.

860
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,360
 So rode on an elephant's head.

861
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,920
 The stories say she fought with a sword in each hand.

862
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,000
 Again, probably why she had to tie down her breasts,

863
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,240
 because otherwise you're in danger of slicing one off, aren't you?

864
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:04,720
 Oh, yeah.

865
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,840
 Mmm.

866
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,240
 She had a voice as loud as a temple bell.

867
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,440
 So, but I think she probably did exist,

868
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,800
 although oddly, she's not mentioned in Chinese sources,

869
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,960
 whereas she's mentioned a lot in Vietnamese sources.

870
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,680
 But I think for China, this was just a...

871
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,960
 You don't really want to write about these people who defeated you a lot,

872
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,760
 especially if it's this woman with extraordinary breasts.

873
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,280
 Whereas in Vietnam, it was much more of a great thing to record.

874
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,960
 Although there is one thing that a lot of the women got written out of history

875
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,840
 in China, didn't they?

876
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,040
 When Neo-Confucianism came in,

877
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,120
 they kind of changed the rules a little bit.

878
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,440
 So women had to be at home

879
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,960
 and had to have this exact role in society.

880
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,800
 And so a lot of the historians in China

881
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,280
 wrote out all of the women in history, I think,

882
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,520
 the man that was 10th century or something.

883
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,880
 It was, I think it was before that.

884
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,760
 And Vietnamese society used to be much more equal,

885
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,200
 in fact, impressively equal,

886
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,360
 until it was sort of from the 1st century,

887
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,760
 Chinese started really encroaching.

888
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,960
 And like you say, it was Confucianism.

889
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,200
 They really liked nuclear families.

890
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,960
 It was just all the same old stories, isn't it?

891
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,760
 Nuclear families, women subservient to men.

892
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,000
 Whereas Vietnamese society was much more clown-based.

893
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,200
 It was quite matriarchal.

894
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,040
 Some people say that it was actually more women-led than man-led.

895
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:22,400
 And so it wasn't totally unusual for the idea of female warriors and female fighters.

896
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,800
 So she was eventually defeated.

897
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,640
 And there's a kind of myth about how she was defeated,

898
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,720
 which is really nice.

899
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,880
 Well, it's maybe a slightly sexist myth, actually.

900
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,720
 The myth is that she was very fastidious,

901
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,800
 and that the Chinese general who defeated her

902
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,120
 sent his men out of the fortress naked,

903
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,880
 kicking up all the dirt and grime.

904
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:42,400
 And she was so horrified by this that she left the battlefield.

905
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,600
 And then her men all panicked,

906
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,800
 because obviously the nine-foot warrior general has run away.

907
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,080
 And that's why they were defeated.

908
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:51,600
 But it feels slightly like she can't cope with a bit of grime.

909
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,000
 Yeah, as the man's willies.

910
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,960
 Yeah, that was Chinese historians who said

911
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,120
 the men exposed their genitals and scared her off.

912
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:03,360
 Which, interestingly, was also claimed of the Trung sisters,

913
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,120
 who were some other Vietnamese warriors.

914
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,760
 And it was said they were defeated when men showed them their balls.

915
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:13,120
 Well, there was this idea that you could scare these people away with penises, wasn't there?

916
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:17,520
 Because there is the really funny story of the Chinese commander

917
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,600
 who, after Lady Trieu died, started having nightmares

918
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:25,680
 where she came to him in his dreams and was saying that she was going to kill him.

919
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:31,600
 And so to keep her away, he hung a hundred wooden penises outside his house

920
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,520
 so that she wouldn't come to him in his dreams.

921
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:39,360
 I mean, that takes a lot of explaining away, doesn't it,

922
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,360
 when your relatives come round to visit.

923
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:44,560
 Whenever a hundred wooden penises outside your house.

924
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,240
 Well, I just saw it in Homes and Gardens last week.

925
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:53,760
 They had a special offer on which, if you buy one, you get 99 free.

926
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:59,600
 Well, what about the Trung sisters then, Anna, who you just mentioned?

927
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,440
 Oh, yeah, they're cracking as well.

928
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,760
 Again, these are real Vietnamese heroes, aren't they?

929
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,720
 Worshiped in Vietnam.

930
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,800
 So this was the first century, a couple of hundred years before Chu.

931
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,440
 And they were Trung Trac and Trung Nhi.

932
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,880
 And they defeated an invading Chinese army.

933
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,160
 And they actually conquered 65 cities in the end.

934
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,000
 And this is about AD 40.

935
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,960
 And Trung Trac became queen.

936
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,480
 And apparently she was a lovely queen.

937
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,240
 She had quite a soft rule.

938
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,280
 She tried to restore a lot of Vietnamese practices.

939
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,840
 And yeah, they're amazing.

940
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,400
 And the idea is that they were raised by their mother,

941
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,640
 who taught them just like you teach men.

942
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,000
 And so taught them how to fight, taught them lots of military skills.

943
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,600
 Yeah.

944
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,720
 And these 65 cities that they conquered,

945
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:49,040
 the head of each city became like the head of one of their armies,

946
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,600
 almost, or one of their groups, all women.

947
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,800
 So they had 65 female generals who would fight

948
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,240
 in the wars against the Chinese.

949
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,480
 One of which was the mum, right?

950
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,280
 Yes, exactly.

951
00:36:59,280 --> 00:36:59,920
 Oh, really?

952
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,560
 Oh, they're like the Kardashians in that sense.

953
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:06,000
 The momager figure is still very important to them.

954
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,960
 Very much like that.

955
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,720
 But just exactly like that, yeah.

956
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,760
 They once killed a tiger so that they could write

957
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,760
 a promise to the people of Vietnam on its skin.

958
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,960
 If you've run out of paper, sometimes it's all you can do.

959
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,520
 I think Khloe Kardashian did that once, actually.

960
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:27,440
 And these Trang sisters were descendants of Lạc Long Quân,

961
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:33,600
 who was the original dragon lord, who is, according to the creation myth of Vietnam,

962
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,760
 he was the founder of the Vietnamese people.

963
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,960
 He married an immortal fairy called Au Cô, and they got married.

964
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:46,960
 And she laid 100 eggs who gave birth to the 100 noble families of Vietnam.

965
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,240
 And they became the elite of the Vietnamese society.

966
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,720
 50 of them preferred to live in the mountains.

967
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,360
 50 of them preferred to live by the sea.

968
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,160
 And they kind of split into these two groups of...

969
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,760
 It's a bit custody battle, isn't it?

970
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,560
 It's a bit...

971
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,240
 Custody was made out of eggs, or...

972
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:06,160
 No, you're right.

973
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,280
 It's like half of the people went with the dragon lord,

974
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,400
 and half of them went with the immortal fairy and his families.

975
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,800
 That would have made a cracking version of that film,

976
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,080
 the parent trap, wouldn't it?

977
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,560
 Where you've got to get your parents back together,

978
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,560
 but they're a dragon lord and an immortal fairy.

979
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,960
 I watched the parent trap last weekend.

980
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,920
 That's so weird.

981
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,960
 Which version?

982
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,080
 The new one with Lindsay Lohan.

983
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:28,960
 Sorry, heathen.

984
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,920
 Now, you say new.

985
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,800
 That's pretty old.

986
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,520
 When I said that Moulin Rouge was a recent film,

987
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,320
 I got the crap kicked out of me on this podcast.

988
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,840
 At its comparison, you knew?

989
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,120
 New compared to the old one.

990
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:43,680
 I said that Moulin Rouge was recent, compared with the history of film,

991
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,040
 and it didn't cut any ice.

992
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:50,240
 Anyway, my point is it would have been vastly improved

993
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,800
 if it included some kind of dragon lord feature.

994
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,960
 So it's a good comparison.

995
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,400
 I've got a couple of things on modern Vietnamese women,

996
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,440
 sort of, who are pretty interesting today.

997
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,840
 So I found this really interesting thing,

998
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,000
 which is the nail industry in America,

999
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,840
 so for manicures and so on,

1000
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:11,680
 approximately 51% of nail technicians in America

1001
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,520
 are Vietnamese descendants.

1002
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,880
 So either Vietnamese-American or have moved over there.

1003
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,560
 80% in California.

1004
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,840
 And this only happened in the last 40 years,

1005
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,000
 and it's as a result, as far as we know,

1006
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,280
 of one single person, which is Tippi Hedren.

1007
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,680
 Now, Tippi Hedren, the actor,

1008
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,560
 the actor who was in the Alfred Hitchcock movies.

1009
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,160
 She's the mother of Melanie Griffiths.

1010
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,360
 Yeah, she was in The Birds.

1011
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:40,320
 She was at refugee camp for Vietnamese in California 40 years ago.

1012
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,040
 And while she was there,

1013
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,640
 she thought it'd be good to teach a skill,

1014
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,560
 and she noticed that they were all very obsessed

1015
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,600
 with her beautiful nails.

1016
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,840
 She had them beautifully manicured and painted,

1017
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,960
 and they all wanted to look at it.

1018
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,120
 So she brought her manicurist in,

1019
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,600
 and a lot of the women who were there as refugees

1020
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,840
 were part of the military intelligence.

1021
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,360
 So they were sort of high-ranking women,

1022
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,320
 a lot of influence, and they all got taught how to do this.

1023
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,000
 And over 40 years, that spread to be a proper way

1024
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,680
 of earning your money in America for them,

1025
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,680
 to the point where it's now 51% of them all descended from this,

1026
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,840
 supposedly from this one refugee camp

1027
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,080
 that Tippi Hedrin just happened to say,

1028
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,840
 "Who wants to learn how to do this?"

1029
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,960
 That is incredible.

1030
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,680
 Remarkable.

1031
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,800
 That could be also different

1032
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,120
 if Tippi Hedrin had brought something else.

1033
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:24,080
 Well, if she taught them, I don't know, bowling,

1034
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:28,400
 it could be like 80% of bowling champions in America

1035
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,440
 are descended from Vietnamese refugees.

1036
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,200
 Oh, thank God it was her and not you.

1037
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,640
 I feel like Tippi Hedrin had her eye

1038
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,640
 on the commercial market a bit more than you did.

1039
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,720
 The demand for bowling tutors wasn't quite what it should be.

1040
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,960
 There is money in bowling if you're good, Anna.

1041
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,440
 And if you...

1042
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,760
 The problem is that in America,

1043
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,480
 there's so many people who already do bowling

1044
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,360
 that even if you have been taught by Tippi Hedrin,

1045
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:54,000
 it's still going to be quite hard to break into that elite,

1046
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,360
 I'm going to say.

1047
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,960
 Yeah, I do see what you mean there.

1048
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,000
 It's a problem.

1049
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,800
 Okay, yeah.

1050
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,000
 I won't try and start this.

1051
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,640
 The first female billionaire in Vietnam was not too long ago,

1052
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,160
 and it was as a result of something

1053
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,120
 which actually slightly sets women back,

1054
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,600
 I would say, via jet air.

1055
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,040
 There was this thing, I don't know if you remember,

1056
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,120
 the bikini-clad flight attendants.

1057
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:20,000
 This was the idea that they would all dress in bikinis,

1058
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,680
 and it became very popular because...

1059
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,880
 They all have three breasts.

1060
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:29,360
 Wait, so she made her money off that airline?

1061
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,440
 Yeah, she made it go public,

1062
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,760
 and when it went public, it turned her into a billionaire.

1063
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,360
 And she's the first-ever billionaire from Vietnam.

1064
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,880
 See, I mean, do you mind about that?

1065
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,080
 I like women, but I hate billionaires.

1066
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,440
 It's difficult.

1067
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,560
 That is tough.

1068
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,160
 Well, luckily, there's not many of them.

1069
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,920
 Luckily, most of the billionaires are men.

1070
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,200
 Yeah, thank God, I still like most women.

1071
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:55,120
 So it's really interesting, I find, about Vietnamese history,

1072
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,840
 which is the fact that it's kind of historical,

1073
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:01,360
 but at the same time, so much of it is very obviously folklore

1074
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:04,880
 and not real, and trying to work out what is which.

1075
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,360
 And I suppose that's quite a lot of similarity

1076
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,120
 with things like the Amazons, right,

1077
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:12,800
 which were largely thought to be quite a mythological group

1078
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,240
 of women who were like warriors who attacked the Greeks

1079
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,680
 and attacked various different people,

1080
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,120
 but actually, the more we look at it,

1081
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,200
 the more we think that there might have been some truth in it.

1082
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:25,120
 So there's this group of people who lived around Ukraine

1083
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,600
 and around all the way up to Siberia,

1084
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,840
 and from around the 9th century BC,

1085
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,520
 they were attacking the Greeks

1086
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,680
 and attacking a lot of different groups around there,

1087
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,240
 but because they were a nomadic tribe,

1088
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,520
 you can't really say,

1089
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,840
 "Well, this group of society will stay at home,

1090
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,680
 and this group of society will go to battle."

1091
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,840
 Basically, everyone had to go everywhere,

1092
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,920
 and so all the women got taught how to fight,

1093
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,920
 and we know this because a lot of burials

1094
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,080
 have been found of Scythian women,

1095
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,800
 and about one third of them have been buried with weapons,

1096
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,760
 which suggests that they will have been warriors.

1097
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,120
 And so we think now that a lot of the Amazonian stories

1098
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,600
 that came through classical times

1099
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,160
 might have been referring to the Scythian women.

1100
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,120
 -Really? -Yeah.

1101
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,240
 That makes sense.

1102
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,520
 Kind of interesting.

1103
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,360
 And because of their horse-riding skills,

1104
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,720
 they could deliver any package with one-day delivery.

1105
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,040
 That was the Amazonian promise back in the day.

1106
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:24,080
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show,

1107
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,280
 and that is my fact.

1108
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,880
 My fact this week is that one of the few incredibly rare times

1109
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,160
 a giant squid has been seen attacking an ocean vessel,

1110
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,720
 which was an image made famous by Jules Verne,

1111
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:38,720
 was in 2003 when a boat was attacked while competing

1112
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,640
 in the Jules Verne Trophy race.

1113
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,480
 Amazing.

1114
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,560
 What incredible coincidence.

1115
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,640
 So this was, I should say,

1116
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,680
 that this was reported by the captain of this ship

1117
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,480
 taking part in this race, Olivier de Casalsen,

1118
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,520
 and he is a captain who's had over 40 years

1119
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,040
 of experience in the ocean,

1120
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:00,000
 and he was taking his boat on this trip

1121
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,080
 when suddenly it kind of ground to a halt.

1122
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,840
 He was thinking, "What the hell is going on?"

1123
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:08,240
 And he saw through the port hole this giant squid,

1124
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,200
 which was attached to it.

1125
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,880
 He's never seen anything like this in his life.

1126
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,560
 He quickly radioed it in saying,

1127
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,720
 "We've got a giant squid that's attached to the boat."

1128
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,200
 They brought it to a complete halt,

1129
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,640
 so they stopped it completely,

1130
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,760
 and it sort of just disattached itself and went off,

1131
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,200
 and that's the last that we saw of it.

1132
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,560
 So we don't have a photo.

1133
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,600
 We don't have anything that can sort of completely verify

1134
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,640
 other than his experience as a sailor

1135
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,000
 and as a good sailor as well.

1136
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,040
 So the Jules Verne trophy is to try and beat the record

1137
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,560
 of going around the world, isn't it?

1138
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,560
 Did he beat the record, do you know?

1139
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,280
 Or...

1140
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,200
 So the way the Jules Verne trophy works

1141
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,960
 is you hand over the trophy to someone who beats the record.

1142
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,720
 Weirdly, there's a world record,

1143
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,160
 which is separate to the Jules Verne,

1144
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,880
 so you have to specifically pay up to this membership group.

1145
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,280
 So he did not win it that year in 2003,

1146
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,120
 but he did win it in 2004.

1147
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:58,400
 So what I'm thinking, Dan, is in 2003,

1148
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,240
 he's sailing around the world.

1149
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,520
 He hasn't beaten the record,

1150
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,040
 and when he comes back, he says,

1151
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,840
 "Well, it's because I got attacked by a giant squid."

1152
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,680
 And they say, "Do you have any photos of it?"

1153
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,520
 And he goes, "No, I don't have any photos,

1154
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,960
 but I got attacked by a giant squid,

1155
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,880
 and that's why I didn't win the race."

1156
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,520
 And I'm not saying that he's lying.

1157
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,160
 I'm just saying that I'd like some evidence.

1158
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,720
 I agree, and I would love to see some three-foot boobs.

1159
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,240
 We can't all have what we want.

1160
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,800
 No, that's absolutely true.

1161
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,000
 It's not the first thing you do.

1162
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,520
 If the first thing you do when you're being attacked

1163
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,280
 by a giant squid is take a photo of it,

1164
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,760
 then you're one of those irritating millennial types

1165
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,280
 who's always got your iPhone on you,

1166
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,280
 and actually, they're a big fish to fry,

1167
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,560
 like getting it off your boat.

1168
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,400
 I'm with this guy.

1169
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,960
 You know the Jules Verne trophy that you mentioned, Dan?

1170
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,080
 Yeah.

1171
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:47,440
 It floats, but it doesn't float just in water.

1172
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,120
 It floats in air.

1173
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,880
 What?

1174
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,400
 This is so cool.

1175
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,800
 The Jules Verne trophy is a metal sculpture

1176
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:55,600
 of a ship's hull, right?

1177
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,240
 And it's quite long.

1178
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,400
 It looks like it's about six or eight feet long.

1179
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,920
 And at the ceremony where you hand it over,

1180
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,000
 because you have to hand it over to the next people to win it,

1181
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,440
 everyone puts on gloves,

1182
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,640
 and you take it out of its case where it is floating

1183
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,080
 on top of a magnetic field.

1184
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,400
 You hand it to the guys who've won it,

1185
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,200
 and they put it back in this huge glass case

1186
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,240
 in a magnetic field,

1187
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,800
 so it just hovers there in mid-air,

1188
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,240
 and then they put it away again.

1189
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:18,960
 That's quite cool.

1190
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:19,840
 It's a floating trophy.

1191
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:20,400
 Isn't that awesome?

1192
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,920
 Why does it?

1193
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,080
 Because of the magnetic field.

1194
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,360
 Yeah, but just because it's cool, right?

1195
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,320
 That's the idea.

1196
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,200
 Yeah, because it's cool.

1197
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:27,200
 Yeah.

1198
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,240
 Great.

1199
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:28,880
 That's Jules Verne.

1200
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,240
 He's a science fiction writer.

1201
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:30,480
 Well, here's the thing.

1202
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,160
 It's a cool science fiction thing.

1203
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,800
 Jules Verne, the reason that this is named after him

1204
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,040
 is because it's around the world in 80 days, right?

1205
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,400
 Which is what he wrote.

1206
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,160
 Can you name any kind of transport

1207
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,960
 that Philius Fogg used in around the world in 80 days?

1208
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,160
 Balloon, hot air balloon.

1209
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:44,880
 Hot air balloon.

1210
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,080
 Amazingly not, right?

1211
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:49,920
 In the book, he doesn't go in a hot air balloon at any stage.

1212
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,040
 It's so weird.

1213
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,840
 It's if you look at in all the Disney films,

1214
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,120
 he's always in a hot air balloon.

1215
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,440
 And if you look at like lots of the books

1216
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,720
 with an illustration on the front,

1217
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,160
 there's always a hot air balloon in it

1218
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,600
 or on the post or whatever.

1219
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,080
 But no, he just goes by train and by boat.

1220
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,600
 I mean, it would be a much more boring Disney film,

1221
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:05,920
 wouldn't it?

1222
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,280
 Just a guy getting trains around.

1223
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,400
 It's a commute.

1224
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:10,960
 It's a film.

1225
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,720
 That's a Michael Portello documentary,

1226
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,680
 not the most thrilling novel of the 19th century.

1227
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:16,480
 That's fascinating.

1228
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,600
 I think the first thing he wrote was about balloon, wasn't it?

1229
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,200
 It was a short story about a cool something,

1230
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,240
 like adventures in a balloon.

1231
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:25,200
 And I feel like people must have conflated those,

1232
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,880
 an inflated, conflated and inflated balloon.

1233
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,520
 You don't inflate a balloon.

1234
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,200
 One of those hot air balloons, do you?

1235
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:33,840
 Don't you?

1236
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:34,400
 You certainly do.

1237
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:34,960
 Yeah.

1238
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,440
 That wasn't the main problem with that joke, I have to say.

1239
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,840
 The technical issue.

1240
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,840
 Yeah, right.

1241
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,200
 It had it.

1242
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,200
 Jules Verne had an amazing life, didn't he?

1243
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:45,680
 Yeah.

1244
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:46,880
 I loved the fact as a boy,

1245
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,800
 his uncle was the mayor of Brains.

1246
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:50,000
 Really?

1247
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:50,720
 Yeah.

1248
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:54,000
 I'm not sure I'm pronouncing the French town of Brains correctly.

1249
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:54,720
 Oh, really?

1250
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:55,680
 How's the spell?

1251
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:56,800
 It's spell Brains.

1252
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:01,520
 He was mates with Alexandre Dumas, amongst other people,

1253
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,360
 who was this great inspiration for him.

1254
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:08,160
 And actually, kind of sadly, Dumas' son once wrote to Jules Verne,

1255
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:13,120
 saying that he considered Verne the true son of Dumas over himself,

1256
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:16,960
 which shows a real lack of self-confidence.

1257
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,480
 What did he write?

1258
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,760
 He wrote Musketeers, was that it?

1259
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,120
 Yeah, and Monte Cristo.

1260
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:21,680
 Yes.

1261
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,240
 Sorry, Andy, for your pronunciation in French,

1262
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,320
 you might know him as an Alexandre Dumas.

1263
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:33,840
 Do you guys know how Jules Verne and Dumas first met, apparently?

1264
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:36,640
 In a hot air balloon.

1265
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:37,440
 Nice.

1266
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,960
 It's almost as cool.

1267
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,600
 This is actually something that was sent in by a listener

1268
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:45,040
 called Elly's Cramer, and it's from a 1954 article

1269
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:48,480
 about a party that Verne was at, where he was kind of bored

1270
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,960
 and he was a bit of a rogue.

1271
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:55,280
 And I think he was referred to as witty and impudent in the article.

1272
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,320
 And so he decided to leave, and he left by sliding down the banister.

1273
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:02,080
 Slid down the banister, smashed straight into someone at the bottom,

1274
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:05,280
 like smashed into his torso, so stood up, didn't know what to say.

1275
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,040
 So the first thing that came to his head said,

1276
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,320
 "Have you had dinner?"

1277
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,240
 Quite an odd thing to say to a stranger.

1278
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,240
 And the man replied he'd had an omelet,

1279
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,920
 at which Verne said no one could make an omelet as well as he could.

1280
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,560
 And so this guy was like, "All right, you make such a good omelet.

1281
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:21,120
 Make me an omelet. I'll come around for dinner next Wednesday."

1282
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,800
 And he gave him...

1283
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,000
 It's the story.

1284
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,400
 It's a true story.

1285
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:31,120
 This guy handed over his business card, and it was Alexandre Dumas.

1286
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:35,600
 This sounds like, you know, if you and your partner met on Tinder or something,

1287
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,440
 and you're like, "Well, we're going to have to come up with a story

1288
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,440
 "when everybody asks us how we met."

1289
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:43,600
 I'll say that I made an omelet. You say you were coming down the banister.

1290
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:47,200
 Yeah. Omelet was the original eggplant emoji, I think.

1291
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,760
 Seems there was a sexual thing going on there.

1292
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,760
 So the thing about Jules Verne is, in Britain,

1293
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,440
 I would say we kind of see him as more of a kid's author, right?

1294
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:02,640
 Because I certainly read a lot of his stuff when I was a teenager or younger still.

1295
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:07,600
 And the reason is because he had really bad translations into English,

1296
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:11,600
 so in France and in Russia and in lots of different countries,

1297
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,600
 he's seen as quite a serious author.

1298
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,600
 But in Britain, he's more of a kid's author.

1299
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:18,560
 And these translations were just bad.

1300
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:22,560
 And the thing about his translations I find really interesting is

1301
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:26,560
 that the British ones were then translated into Japanese.

1302
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:32,560
 So in Japan, they get a translated version of the English stuff, not the French stuff.

1303
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:35,600
 I mean, obviously, these days, you get better translations.

1304
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,600
 But the original Japanese ones.

1305
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:41,600
 And then in China, they translated the Japanese ones,

1306
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:45,600
 which had been translated from English, which had been translated from French.

1307
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:49,600
 So you get this weird sort of Chinese whispers things going on.

1308
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:53,600
 But also in Chinese kind of oral tradition, as a storyteller,

1309
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:57,600
 you would kind of add your own little footnotes and stuff like that, right?

1310
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:01,600
 And so the original French one section of, I think,

1311
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:05,600
 I've not written down what bucket is, but I think it's around the world in 80 days.

1312
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,600
 And really apologies for my French here.

1313
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,600
 But it says something like,

1314
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:21,600
 [speaking French]

1315
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:25,600
 So it says, after the Civil War, a new club that was very influential

1316
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:29,600
 was established in Baltimore, which is in Maryland.

1317
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:34,600
 And the Chinese version becomes anyone who has studied world geography and history

1318
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,600
 knows of a place called America.

1319
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:40,600
 As for the American War of Independence, not the Civil War, by the way,

1320
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:43,600
 even children know that it was an earth-shattering event,

1321
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,600
 a deed that ought to be recalled often and never forgotten.

1322
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:49,600
 Now, among all those states that participated in the war,

1323
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:53,600
 one of them was called Maryland, whose capital, Baltimore, not the capital,

1324
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:58,600
 was a famous city teeming with crowds and packed with the traffic of horses and carriages

1325
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:01,600
 in this city was a club, magnificent in appearance,

1326
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:06,600
 and as soon as you saw the high-flying American flag flapping in the wind in front,

1327
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:09,600
 you naturally felt a sense of awe.

1328
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:13,600
 Amazing translation of that one sentence.

1329
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:17,600
 And someone who doesn't want to be a translator, they want to be an author.

1330
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,600
 A translation.

1331
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:22,600
 Also being paid by the word.

1332
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:26,600
 And the only thing people are going to write in about is the reference to Maryland

1333
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:28,600
 Oh, Maryland, yeah.

1334
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,600
 I'll be furious, James.

1335
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,600
 Pronouncing things.

1336
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:35,600
 Not so easy now, is it?

1337
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:39,600
 There was a guy who claimed to be the real Philius Fogg,

1338
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,600
 who was called George Francis Train.

1339
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:44,600
 We've mentioned him once before, actually, I think.

1340
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:49,600
 So he went around the world in 1870, and then the book was published at about 1873,

1341
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:54,600
 give or take, but he had already travelled around the world supposedly in 80 days.

1342
00:52:54,600 --> 00:53:00,600
 Yes, so he was 80 days travelling, but he stopped off in Paris for two months.

1343
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:04,600
 During his time, he was arrested and sent to prison for two weeks.

1344
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:08,600
 And I think it might have been Dumas who got him out of prison, actually.

1345
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:13,600
 But he was basically, it wasn't really an 80-day full trip.

1346
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:17,600
 But the first person who did it in under 80 days, I think, was Nellie Bly,

1347
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:20,600
 who did it in 1890, right?

1348
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,600
 And she did it in '72.

1349
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:23,600
 Yeah, that's right.

1350
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:26,600
 And released the book around the world in '72, Day.

1351
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:29,600
 Very unimaginative. I think you could sue her for that.

1352
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:33,600
 But she also, she pit-stocked and said hi to Jules Verne along the way.

1353
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,600
 How meta is that?

1354
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:39,600
 That is weird. It's like your book's coming to life in front of your very eyes.

1355
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,600
 So she was a journalist, right?

1356
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:46,600
 And she was working for, was it the New York World?

1357
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,600
 It was for Pulitzer, anyway.

1358
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:53,600
 So she was working for Pulitzer and she said, "I want to go around the world in 80 days

1359
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:56,600
 and I want to write my story about it."

1360
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,600
 She was an investigative journalist.

1361
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:03,600
 And the newspaper had a Nellie Bly guessing match where people could guess exactly how long it would take her

1362
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:08,600
 to get around the world by the minute.

1363
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,600
 And if you got the closest, then you'd win a prize.

1364
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:15,600
 And she travelled by ship, train and donkey, the three things that she used.

1365
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:19,600
 It feels like the ship and the train probably did most of the legs.

1366
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:24,600
 When she met Verne in Paris, she, he said, "You know, I'm so impressed by you.

1367
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:31,600
 If you manage to do this in 79 days, I'll applaud with both hands."

1368
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:34,600
 I'll ask you a question, what the alternative way of applauding is.

1369
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:38,600
 Yeah, she was cool. She, they didn't want to send her around at first, I don't think.

1370
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,600
 So she had this idea and she insisted on being sent around the world.

1371
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:46,600
 And first, the editor of the New York World said, "No, a woman can't do this, I'm afraid."

1372
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:52,600
 And she said very well, "Start the man and I'll start the same day for some other newspaper and beat him."

1373
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:57,600
 And so then they caved and she sort of put one outfit, few changes of underwear.

1374
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,600
 But she had a rival, didn't she?

1375
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:03,600
 This woman called Elizabeth Bisland, who was sent round by Cosmo.

1376
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:09,600
 And it was the sort of classy alternative to Nellie Bly who was racing her basically.

1377
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:13,600
 But Nellie didn't know to begin with, right? So she was engaged in a race she wasn't aware of.

1378
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:17,600
 And then when she found out, she just didn't care if she was like, "I'm not doing this for a race."

1379
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:22,600
 Oh really? Yeah, what? She claimed she didn't care, but she sprinted away when she was told.

1380
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:28,600
 I'd rather see if they're going to remake Around the World in 80 Days for one billionth time or whatever for Disney.

1381
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:35,600
 Then I would much rather see the Nellie Bly versus this woman from Cosmo trying to race around the world in 80 days

1382
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,600
 rather than some Philly as a card character.

1383
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:41,600
 It's not great spectator, I guess, because the race is very much two quite separate people.

1384
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,600
 You just have to keep cutting between them.

1385
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:47,600
 She said apparently the moment when she found out was in Hong Kong.

1386
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:51,600
 And so Nellie Bly arrived in Hong Kong and Elizabeth Bisland was beating her at the time.

1387
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:56,600
 And in fact, I think it was beating her until she got back to Britain where she was told she'd missed her boat,

1388
00:55:56,600 --> 00:56:00,600
 which was actually a lie. She hadn't missed her boat. No one knows if that was a trick.

1389
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:03,600
 But when Nellie Bly got to Hong Kong, a guy who met her there said,

1390
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:06,600
 "Oh, are you the one that's racing the other person?"

1391
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:10,600
 And Nellie said, "Yeah, I'm in a race. I'm in a race with time."

1392
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:13,600
 And the guy said, "I don't think that was her name."

1393
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:17,600
 Thus she discovered.

1394
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:22,600
 It is a good premise for a film because one of them is all working for Cosmo.

1395
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:25,600
 It's all kind of high powered and doing it in high heels and it'll scrubbed up.

1396
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:29,600
 And the other one's Nellie Bly who's sort of a street urchin vibe to her.

1397
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:33,600
 That's what I was saying. It's amazing. And then it's a bit like Race Around the World,

1398
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:40,600
 where you make them have to stop in London and meet each other and stay in the same hotel and talk about, you know...

1399
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:43,600
 And they become friendly in the way.

1400
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,600
 Working up. Yeah, they become friends.

1401
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:50,600
 No, but they become enemies, but they respect each other like superheroes and super enemies.

1402
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:53,600
 Like forgers and their chasers.

1403
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:56,600
 Another part of Nellie Bly's life, which would have been a good movie,

1404
00:56:56,600 --> 00:57:00,600
 is when she exposed all the insane asylums in America,

1405
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:08,600
 because she pretended to be insane and got herself committed to an asylum on Blackwells Island in New York.

1406
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:12,600
 And it was basically an expose of how badly treated these sick people were.

1407
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:17,600
 She showed that they were doing beatings and ice cold baths and forced meals,

1408
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,600
 including really rotten butter and rotten food.

1409
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:25,600
 And that actually changed the way that asylums works in America, thanks to her expose.

1410
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,600
 But she never got out. That's the sad thing.

1411
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,600
 She kept saying, "I'm a journalist. I've just been writing an expose."

1412
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,600
 Sure you are, yeah.

1413
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:36,600
 I've been around the world for 80 days. Yeah, right.

1414
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:42,600
 And the nurse turns around and suddenly you see it's Elizabeth Diskin standing there.

1415
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:45,600
 No!

1416
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:49,600
 Roll credit.

1417
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:53,600
 Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening.

 Yep, but you can go to our group account, which is @NoSuchThing,

1427
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:13,600
 or our website, NoSuchThingAsAfish.com, where all of our previous episodes are,

1428
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:17,600
 as well as links to merchandise and links to any upcoming tour dates as well.

1429
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:21,600
 Also, our partners, Audio Boom, are currently conducting a survey

1430
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:24,600
 on how listeners like to listen to their podcasts.

1431
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:28,600
 And they've asked us if you could head to audioboom.com/survey

1432
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:31,600
 to tell them and answer their questions.

1433
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,600
 They are going to give out a nice prize.

1434
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:38,600
 It's a 50-pound voucher to Amazon for anyone who they select who has done the survey.

1435
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:41,600
 So you do have a chance to win that 50 pounds.

1436
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:46,600
 So if you do feel like going there and telling them how you listen to podcasts, please do.

1437
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,600
 And say that you like us lots.

1438
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:49,600
