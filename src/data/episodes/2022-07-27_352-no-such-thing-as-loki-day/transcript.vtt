WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 Hi everybody, before we start this week's show, we all have an announcement for you.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.240
 Are we all gonna do it at once? Now let's do one word at a time.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.800
 Okay, brilliant. That'll be fun, you know, like that amazing improv game.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.440
 Oh, great, yeah.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.960
 So I'll go first. We have...

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:15.680
 Written.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.920
 A.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.280
 New.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:17.680
 Book.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.400
 That's called...

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.440
 Oh, Jesus, come on, guys. Never mind. We've written the new book.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.440
 It's called Funny You Should Ask. It's available in all shops. It's really good.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.760
 If you're looking for a last-minute Christmas gift,

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.360
 I can't think of anything better, really.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.880
 It is. It's sort of a compilation of the weirdest questions that might spring to your mind in your

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.080
 very bored moments, things you've always wondered, things you've never wondered,

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.240
 but now you're desperate to know the answer to, like,

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.680
 who would win in a race out of a human, a fish, or a mermaid?

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.120
 Or if I take a swan to the vet, does the queen have to pay?

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.680
 Yeah, if spiders can walk on the ceiling, why can't they get out of the bath?

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.840
 Huge question. Always wondered about that.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.600
 Why does cat food come in beef and lamb flavours, but not mouse flavour?

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.800
 Such a good question.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.120
 Yeah.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.200
 Buy it for your cat as a Christmas present.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.160
 Your cat wants to know.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.920
 And this book, it's not just written by us for it.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.200
 It's written by all the QILs, so a lot of the QILs that you'll know

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.360
 because they've come on here, like Alex and Anne,

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.200
 but loads of the other QILs that are just a complete mystery even to me,

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.360
 even though I've been working with them for many, many years.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.240
 It's fun. It's a lovely blue colour and it's reasonably priced.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.720
 It could not be the more perfect Christmas present

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.240
 to give you all the conversation you'll need.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.040
 So get it for the facts, but mainly for the blue on the cover.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.480
 And it's available in bookshops and on the internet.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.000
 You know how to buy a book, do it.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 Funny you should ask by the QILs.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.160
 OK, on with the podcast.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:57.120
 Hello and welcome to another episode

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.400
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.520
 from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.720
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.840
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.960
 and James Harkin.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.200
 And once again, we have gathered round the microphones

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.000
 with our four favourite facts from the last seven days.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.640
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.360
 Starting with you, Andy.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.920
 My fact is, there is such a big market for fake letters by Abraham Lincoln

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.640
 that people have started selling fake fakes.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.640
 Wow.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.880
 Yeah. How cool is this?

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.440
 There's a big old market for fake letters of Abraham Lincoln.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.600
 People, he died in 1865.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.760
 And there were a load of scam artists in the 20s and 30s

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.560
 who started faking the letters and faking his signature,

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.360
 using old paper, all these amazing tactics they used.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.720
 And those fake letters are now worth thousands of dollars

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.680
 in their own right.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.040
 They've sold for thousands of dollars each.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.400
 But obviously, that means there's a market.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.880
 And so people have started forging forgeries.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.120
 And is it like Chinese whispers,

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.720
 where the fake fake fakes look absolutely nothing

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.080
 like the original letters?

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.880
 It's just a picture of a horse's ass.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.200
 Yeah, Abraham Lincoln letters.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.440
 But so these fake fakes, they have to be attributed

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.440
 to the fake writer, right?

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.880
 So as in people who became famous in that period

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.520
 for having written these fake letters in themselves

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.520
 have become celebrities in that world,

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.480
 and then they're buying fakes of the fake forwarders one.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.240
 It's not just a random fake.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.920
 No, no, but also it's the fact

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.920
 that the real ones are so expensive.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:40.880
 Is that right?

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.840
 Like, if you're a person with a normal income

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.640
 and you want to buy a Lincoln letter, you just can't afford it.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.720
 So the next best thing is to buy a fake one.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.080
 Yeah, exactly.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.960
 Yeah. And the weird thing is,

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.080
 there are so many Abraham Lincoln memorabilia collectors

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.640
 in the USA.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.240
 It seems to be the national pastime.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.160
 I always thought it was American football,

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.120
 but I turned on the TV on Thanksgiving

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.200
 and it was just people passing around fake letters

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.160
 to each other.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.080
 If you look closely at these stands

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.440
 in American football matches,

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.800
 they're all trading their Abraham Lincoln bits of beard.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.560
 There are 15,000 collectors, apparently serious collectors

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.920
 of memorabilia, not just your fly-by-night amateurs.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.360
 50,000, Jesus.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.920
 Yeah, which is 1,000 more than there are books written about.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.840
 Apparently, there have been 14,000 books

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.040
 written about Abraham Lincoln.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.800
 Still a lot, isn't it?

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.000
 It's a record after Jesus and Napoleon, apparently.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.280
 Really interesting.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.920
 I saw it when we were in Washington, D.C.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.280
 for our tour last year.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.960
 I saw a huge pillar at the Ford Theatre

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.800
 where they have glued every single book

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.000
 that's been written about Lincoln,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.680
 or at least as many as they could get,

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.160
 to a pillar that extends to about four floors.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.880
 We should say the most famous faker is Joseph Cozy, right?

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.400
 And is it mostly his that are being sold that are being forged?

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.240
 So Joseph Cozy was sort of the big Lincoln faker

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.160
 who was kind of an amazing guy.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.600
 So he started out.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.560
 He went into the Library of Congress.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.720
 He was really into American history and stuff.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.520
 And then he saw a pay warrant

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.200
 that was endorsed by Benjamin Franklin.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.400
 So he had his signature on it.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.760
 This was in 1929, and the pay warrant was from 1786.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.800
 And he took it.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.560
 And his argument when he was caught

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.800
 was that the Library of Congress belongs to the people,

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.680
 and he's one of the people.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.960
 So it's not actually stealing.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:25.840
 Anyway.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.920
 Oh, wow. That's a good argument.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.560
 So he went to sell it to a dealer who told him it was fake.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.160
 He knew it wasn't fake.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.200
 So he basically devoted his life to making actual fakes

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.960
 to screw over these idiot dealers

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.080
 who couldn't tell the difference.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.480
 Wow.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.920
 I mean, that must have been pretty hard for him to go in and say,

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.760
 "No, it's not fake. I stole it from the Library of..."

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.040
 Yeah, actually, I did buy it from a dodgy guy on the phone.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.200
 It's so weird.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.720
 This relationship he had with his arch enemy

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.400
 is a bit like, you know, in superhero films,

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.440
 which I don't watch.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.000
 They, I think, the superhero, often,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.680
 as well as hating his arch enemy,

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.440
 has this weird grudging respect for him,

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.200
 and they'll have a chat at the end, you know,

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.640
 where they're bonding.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.400
 It's kind of like that happens.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.840
 He had that with William Burquist,

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.560
 who was the investigator for the New York Public Library.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.800
 And it was him who spotted in 1933

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.040
 something dodgy was going on with the documents,

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.120
 set up this big sting operation,

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.360
 caught Cosy as he was trying to, like, escape

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.120
 getting away with forging stuff,

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.880
 and basically congratulated him,

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.040
 brought him down to the police station, said, "You're a genius."

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.600
 And Cosy immediately was like, "Oh, thanks.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.800
 Well, you should see what I've done with this,"

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.960
 and pulled some little forgeries out of his pocket.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.400
 I was like, "Look at this."

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.280
 And Burquist was like,

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.760
 "Look, employ your talents better in future, please.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.600
 Don't do it again. Off you go."

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.560
 And Cosy disappeared,

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.360
 and immediately started forging loads and loads of stuff again.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.040
 But they sort of hung out,

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.600
 as well as Burquist trying to stop these forgeries

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.440
 getting into the market and trying to suppress him.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.320
 They also, like, paid each other social calls sometimes.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.240
 He would occasionally give Cosy a bit of money

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.520
 to help him on his way.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.880
 -Wow. -It's very weird.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.000
 All right, it's weird.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.840
 Do you know how Cosy got started?

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.440
 He got... He was in the Army originally.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.080
 Not originally.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.280
 He joined the Army as a young man, I guess.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:07.920
 Not as a baby.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.080
 Look, anyway, he got started...

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.640
 That's why they call it the infantry, isn't it?

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:13.840
 (LAUGHS)

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:20.400
 He got kicked out of the Army for assaulting a cook in his company.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.760
 I don't know why he assaulted the cook,

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.520
 but he forged a certificate of honourable discharge from the Army

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.920
 because he was obviously dishonorably discharged.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.200
 And so that was, I think,

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.400
 one of his first steps on the road to forging all this other stuff.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.280
 Yes, but he signed it as Abraham Lincoln, which was a bit confusing.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.120
 He never really made money from it.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.640
 He sold stuff quite cheap.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.080
 I think Cosy was nervous

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.480
 that if he tried to sell it really expensively,

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.480
 people would interrogate it more.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.920
 So he'd sell it quite cheap.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.520
 And he said when he was questioned,

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.520
 the pleasure that he got was from seeing that forgery that he sold

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.600
 climbing up and up the auction market

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.640
 and then selling for a huge amount in an auction house,

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.920
 him sitting there at home, you know, tapping his fingers together,

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:05.760
 going, "Oh, I know that's just something I scribbled in my bathroom."

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:06.560
 Yeah.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.960
 And he had a little bit of a loophole, didn't he?

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.040
 Because he, in New York,

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:14.640
 it was illegal to kind of advertise something as being something it wasn't

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:15.920
 and then selling it on.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.520
 But if you went to someone and just said,

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.400
 "Oh, I found this scribbled signature.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.000
 I don't know who it's by.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.040
 I don't know what it's on.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.920
 I know it says Abraham Lincoln, but I don't know who did it."

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.600
 Then, and you sold it to them,

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.280
 then technically that wasn't a felony.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.040
 So that's so clever.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.000
 Yeah.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:32.960
 Well, we don't know.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.480
 He might, I don't think he is,

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.880
 but there's a suggestion that he kept operating

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.120
 for years and years after he went able

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:43.200
 because he kind of dropped off the radar in 1943.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.800
 But even in 1956,

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.400
 the New Yorker wrote a piece saying,

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.840
 "Is he still producing forgeries?

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:48.960
 We don't know."

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:49.840
 So you're saying he could,

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.600
 were you about to say he might still be around today

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.200
 if you've actually got a signed copy

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.800
 of a "Know Such Things as a Fish" book?

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.160
 Check it out, Joseph Cosy.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:01.680
 Do you know how you can tell if a Lincoln letter is fake?

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.600
 No. How can you do that?

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.800
 Oh, there are so many exciting ways you can tell.

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.560
 So one is what he wrote.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.600
 So if...

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.040
 If he's talking about his iPad.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:15.600
 That basically is one of the tips they give,

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.040
 is what he, you know,

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.480
 is it signed 1866 or later, in which case it's not real.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.840
 But another thing is just what he signed.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:29.280
 So he never, ever signed Abe or Honest Abe or Old Abe.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.200
 That's just...

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.880
 Oh, the Abe Meister.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:33.520
 Exactly.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.680
 It's either Abe Lincoln on letters,

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.080
 or if he was a lawyer, he would just sign Lincoln.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.040
 So there are all these things.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:45.360
 Also, if you wrote a letter on animal skin, then it's fake.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:45.520
 Oh, really?

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:46.960
 Because a lot of presidential documents

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.480
 are on animal skin, or vellum,

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.000
 and their letters are on paper.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.040
 That's another way you can tell.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.920
 Oh, it wasn't like he was an early animal rights campaigner

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:54.560
 or anything.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.160
 You know, we shouldn't be using the animals for honest.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.040
 Absolutely not.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:57.680
 No.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.960
 Do you guys see that,

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.800
 I think it was only in the last month or so,

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.760
 they sold a lock of Lincoln's hair for $50,000.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.640
 Wow.

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:10.000
 Although, there is a thing about fake locks of hair.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.920
 We do know that quite a lot of them exist,

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.920
 because one collector said,

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.320
 "If every lock of Lincoln's hair out there was genuine,

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.840
 the man would have been a wooly mammoth."

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:22.880
 I'm not quite sure what the provenance of this is.

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.000
 $50,000.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.200
 Yeah, that's amazing.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:30.240
 I went on eBay to look at what the most expensive items

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:33.600
 currently on eBay are that you can buy that are related to Lincoln.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.160
 And hair is a big, big thing.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.360
 So there's strands of hair that you could buy of Lincoln,

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.800
 and they're all quite affordable.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:44.000
 I found one for £636 that you could buy.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.120
 I found an exciting,

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:48.960
 well, the more exciting one is the bundle that I found.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:48.960
 It's for his son.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.400
 It's for his baby son, all right?

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.480
 That's not for Dan.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.600
 I'm more interested in this one for $1,500.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.720
 You can get a bundle of Lincoln, Geronimo, Lord Nelson,

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:02.560
 and King George's hair for $1,500, which is exciting.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.400
 And then twice them all together.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.160
 No, they're four separate cards.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:06.800
 Oh, that's true.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.160
 Yeah, you could have the ultimate wig,

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.600
 the ultimate historical wig.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.880
 I don't think this one's real, I have to say.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.640
 The other things that this guy's selling is,

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.400
 you know, Tiger King, Joe Exotic.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.560
 He's selling premium condoms of this guy's.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:22.320
 So it's a big premium condoms of this guy's.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.280
 Do you mean...

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:26.720
 I know, because I only thought he did the basic condoms.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.200
 I'm a bit annoyed that I've been buying

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.040
 the wrong Joe Exotic condoms now.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.800
 I don't know Tiger King, Joe Exotic,

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.400
 but I don't think I need to.

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.080
 Oh, OK, it was a bit bigger.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.680
 Imagine the superhero movie,

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.080
 where you've got one superhero who keeps tigers

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:45.280
 and another superhero who's a woman who also keeps tigers,

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.120
 and they kind of have a grudging respect

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.120
 for each other, apart from they don't really.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.120
 Then that's pretty much where you are.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.400
 Sounds amazing, thanks.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:52.960
 I'll watch it off.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.520
 Yeah, it's huge.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.760
 I'm just on Lincoln Letters.

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.080
 Did you know that whenever he wrote a letter

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.240
 that was a bit angry or telling someone off

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.680
 or disagreeing with someone,

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:02.800
 as soon as he'd written it,

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.640
 he put it in a locked drawer overnight?

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:07.760
 The equivalent of not sending your email

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.360
 until the next morning.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.000
 That's clever.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:10.720
 That's hot.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:11.040
 Yeah.

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:11.760
 That's a really good idea.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:12.560
 Yeah, it's good stuff.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.160
 Yeah, you should do that more often, Andy.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:18.160
 I stand by everything I said in that letter to you, I know.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.760
 I mean, Andy goes to bed at half-night every night.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.600
 It's not like that.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.720
 There's 915 drunken emails from him though, too much.

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:33.520
 Did you guys know that Abraham Lincoln's hair

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.920
 went to the inauguration of Teddy Roosevelt?

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.440
 I didn't know that.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:42.560
 Yeah, so he was handed a ring by John Hay,

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.560
 who was the Secretary of State for Roosevelt.

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:46.800
 But he was also Lincoln's personal secretary

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.480
 between 1861 and '65.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:51.120
 He had a strand of Lincoln's hair,

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.640
 and he put it into a ring.

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:55.040
 And the ring was worn by Teddy Roosevelt

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:58.320
 on the day that he was inaugurated in 1905 as president.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.600
 Yeah, so Lincoln was there.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.360
 Did they do that kind of something old,

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.960
 something new, something borrowed, something blue?

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:03.440
 That's right.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.000
 The day.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:04.560
 Exactly.

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:05.440
 Lincoln related.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.680
 For the next inauguration, it's going to be

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.560
 Donald Trump's hair that's going to be worn.

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.640
 And the something old is the actual president.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:12.880
 Yeah.

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.280
 Something orange.

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:19.840
 Speaking of Donald Trump, at the time of recording,

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.360
 he still hasn't left the White House,

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.040
 and I'm assuming he probably won't have done that.

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.040
 We can put this out anytime now, anytime.

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:29.440
 Do you know someone else who refused to leave the White House

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.040
 was Mary Todd Lincoln?

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.080
 Really?

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:32.560
 Yeah.

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.480
 So when Abraham Lincoln died,

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:38.160
 obviously it was, you know, extremely distressing for her.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:39.280
 She was inconsolable.

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.200
 She locked herself into the White House,

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.280
 and Andrew Johnson couldn't move in.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.160
 And so Andrew Johnson became president on April the 15th,

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.880
 and he couldn't move into the White House until May the 26th,

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:52.960
 because Mary Todd Lincoln just refused to leave.

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.440
 You can buy her opera glasses.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:56.160
 You can't buy them.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.240
 Actually, no, there isn't one pair.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.280
 This is the problem.

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.000
 So there is a pair of opera glasses, which ivory,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.200
 and they were engraved.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.320
 Mary Lincoln left these glasses in the box at Ford's Theatre

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:09.920
 Good Friday, April 14th, when our president and leader

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:10.880
 was cruelly assassinated.

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:14.720
 They sold for £9,000 last year,

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.200
 but there are at least three pairs of Abraham Lincoln's

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.960
 opera glasses in circulation,

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.520
 which does make you consider just how keen was he

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:22.480
 on seeing this play?

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:26.320
 Well, it's so good for the collectors

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.760
 of the weird paraphernalia,

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.840
 which is a lot of it is around the assassination, isn't it?

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.760
 People collecting stuff that was at the theatre.

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.400
 And it's great for them that Abraham Lincoln seemed to stuff

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:35.360
 his pockets with stuff.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:39.040
 There's a collection.

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:42.080
 I think it's in the Library of Congress,

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.320
 and it's the contents of Abraham Lincoln's pockets

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.840
 on the night of the assassination.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:46.560
 It's just full.

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.560
 I don't know how big pockets were in those days,

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:52.400
 but that was two pairs of glasses, I guess.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.400
 You lose one while you're sitting there watching the opera.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.520
 You've got a second.

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.520
 One of them was mended with string, I guess,

00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.040
 because he's such a humble guy,

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.680
 such a kind of Jeremy Corbyn-style leader,

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:02.880
 having glasses taped together.

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.640
 Well, like Jack Duckworth, I think.

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.720
 Jack Duckworth.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.480
 Sorry, that's a coronation.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.360
 It's a superhero.

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:09.920
 It's a superhero.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:10.480
 It's a superhero.

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:14.800
 He becomes Duck Man at times of great stress.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:18.080
 He was carrying a pocket knife,

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.200
 which I think is so painful,

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.120
 because he could have whipped that out and defended himself

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.720
 had he not been shot in the back of that.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.080
 He would have literally been bringing a knife

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.040
 to a gunfight, hadn't he?

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.040
 [laughter]

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:34.000
 OK, it is time for fact number two,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.760
 and that is James.

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:39.440
 OK, my fact this week is that if you ask someone what day it is,

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:42.160
 they'll take twice as long to answer on a Wednesday

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.240
 as they would on a Monday or Friday.

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:48.000
 And that's because by Wednesday,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.320
 you literally have no idea what day it is.

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:53.520
 Does this data take into account everyone working at home

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:56.160
 and having no idea at all?

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.600
 We might come to that later.

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:58.320
 Oh, OK.

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:02.000
 But let me quickly explain this study very quickly.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.280
 So this is a 2015 study by David A. Ellis,

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:06.880
 Richard Wiseman, and Rob Jenkins.

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:10.000
 And they asked people what day is it?

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.680
 That's the first thing that they asked.

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:14.240
 And they timed how long it took people to respond.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.320
 And most of the differences

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.880
 were not really significant statistically,

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:20.640
 but they did find the statistical difference

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:22.800
 between Monday and Wednesday,

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.600
 which was it took just over half a second for people to say,

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.280
 well, it's Monday, obviously.

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:31.200
 And it took about a second and a half just under for people to go,

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:34.080
 it's Wednesday.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:36.240
 And the same was between Wednesday and Friday.

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.880
 But none of the other comparisons were kind of significant.

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:43.040
 And they reckon that it's because Monday is a really depressing day

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.400
 because the week starts in.

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:47.920
 Friday is the exciting day because it's the new Monday.

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:50.800
 And then in the middle, they all kind of come together.

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.320
 And that's what they think.

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.240
 Friday is really exciting

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.160
 because I get to go to bed at 10 o'clock on Friday.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:02.640
 James, when they did the survey, when they were asking people,

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:04.720
 did they kind of dress up the actual survey

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:07.120
 as just a bit of form filling in before the experiment began?

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:08.800
 So they said, all right, let's just get you logged in.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:09.680
 So what day is it?

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:10.800
 And then timed them.

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:11.680
 You're smashing it.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.120
 You would be at scientists.

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:14.080
 Yeah, that's what they did.

00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:16.880
 They didn't tell people what the study was about.

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:20.400
 And they said, OK, first of all, what day do you think it is?

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.360
 That's so funny.

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:23.440
 But then did they ask them to leave straight away?

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.840
 Because you'd really think you'd absolutely failed that initial question.

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:26.800
 Yes, out.

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:27.760
 OK, you can go.

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.280
 The whole rest of the day, you'd be going,

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:30.400
 fuck, is it Thursday?

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.920
 That's a Tuesday?

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:34.720
 But you'd kind of know it, though,

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.560
 because if you had to go in for a survey,

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:39.600
 I'd be in the preceding week going, oh, god, I remember,

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:40.880
 I've got that survey on Wednesday.

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.400
 What are you doing on Wednesday?

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.000
 I've got to go and do the survey.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.360
 That would be at the forefront of my mind.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.320
 That's a really good point.

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.480
 I'm not sure in the study, if they thought about that,

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:52.400
 were actually the fact that they're doing the study affects the result.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.160
 I suppose it does in a way like you say.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:54.560
 Yeah.

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:56.320
 So the difference might be even greater.

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:56.640
 The difference.

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:57.440
 Would have thought.

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:59.200
 Yeah, could be, could be.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:02.720
 But during lockdown, there was a study done in America.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.880
 This was by the Southwest News Service.

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.880
 And they asked people what day it was.

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:10.240
 And 59% of people said they were unsure what day it was.

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:10.800
 And that was the show.

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:11.200
 Wow.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.680
 Most people didn't know what month it was this year.

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:17.360
 I'm not sure how scientific that one was.

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:20.080
 And there was another study with a different set of people

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:21.760
 which says what days it feel like.

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:26.080
 And they found that usually people kind of got it right.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:30.800
 But mismatches were 52.2% during a bank holiday.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:34.560
 So more than half of people in a bank holiday week

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:35.760
 will not be quite sure.

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.280
 Or will think it feels like a different day

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.560
 than it actually feels like.

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:39.200
 Which I think is right.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.080
 I agree with that, Steve.

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.680
 I definitely have that, yeah.

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:42.160
 Yeah.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:42.720
 Yeah.

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:46.080
 People, it's because, and they've theorised that it's because

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:47.120
 certain days have stronger.

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.800
 Identities than others.

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:49.280
 Don't know as well.

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:50.960
 They said, which is really sad for some of the real

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.120
 personality list days in the middle of the week.

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.360
 But I think in the follow up study,

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.360
 which was also David Ellis and Co.

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.520
 They asked people for the words they associate most

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:00.720
 with certain days.

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:01.520
 It's very predictable.

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:05.840
 It's Monday is words like boredom, tiredness, and rubbish.

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:08.960
 Friday is fun, friends, party, and bacon, apparently.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:10.560
 One of them is pop words.

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:13.120
 I mean, is there a big tradition of bacon Fridays?

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:14.160
 I don't know about.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:14.880
 I think there is.

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:18.240
 I was going to say in my family, because I grew up in a

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.000
 Catholic family, we weren't allowed to meet or we weren't

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.600
 supposed to have meat on Fridays.

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.640
 I mean, maybe that's why you're thinking about it so much

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:24.960
 though.

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:28.160
 Yes, I could really do with a bacon Saturday.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:32.720
 Yeah, I think maybe I definitely, this is anecdote now,

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:36.960
 not data, but I definitely would allow myself to have a

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:41.760
 bacon sandwich on a Friday, which is a bit really less

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:45.520
 healthy than obviously the grains and vegetables I

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:46.640
 normally consume.

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:48.000
 Such a scar.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.200
 Insight into your unbelievably weird mind, Andy.

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:51.760
 Friday.

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.680
 Friday is a huge day for you, isn't it, Andy?

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.640
 Bacon sandwich in the morning, 10 p.m. bed time.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:58.960
 My God, you're off the chain.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.520
 You probably got to bed early on a Thursday thinking,

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.920
 well, I'm really looking forward to getting up for next

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:05.760
 morning like kids on Christmas Eve.

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:08.320
 I want to maximise the Friday awakeness, yeah.

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.840
 Actually, this is a thing where people are more concerned

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:14.560
 with their health on a Monday than any other day of the week.

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:18.560
 So just if you look at Google searches, people search for

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.760
 health-related things, you know, how to stop smoking or

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:24.560
 starting a diet or making a doctor's appointment.

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.840
 They do that 80% more on a Monday than on a Saturday.

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:32.000
 No one on a Saturday is searching how to give up smoking.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.600
 We've all got our bacon hangover that we're trying to get out of.

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:40.720
 There are certain countries and cultures that make it a lot

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:42.800
 easier for you to remember what day it is.

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:46.560
 So in Thailand, they used to do a thing where they would dress

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:47.920
 in the colour of the day.

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:50.080
 So every day is assigned a colour.

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:53.840
 Sunday red, Monday yellow, Tuesday pink, Wednesday green,

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:56.480
 Thursday orange, Friday blue, Saturday purple.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:00.240
 And those colours were all to do with Hindu astrological

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:03.040
 influences and the colour was given to each one of them.

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.200
 So you would go out of your house and you would wear

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.120
 if it was a Monday yellow.

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:09.680
 Everyone would be wearing yellow on a Monday.

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.920
 This is, yeah, this is a while ago.

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:14.720
 So, and it might be that you would have a statement piece

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.960
 on you that was yellow just to represent it.

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:20.560
 And nowadays, because everyone knows their own colour

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.240
 because they're born on one of those days,

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.640
 they have a personal colour, that becomes their colour.

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:27.120
 So more often than not, you'll see that as a prominent colour

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.560
 on someone in Thailand.

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:31.440
 And you can go, oh, you were born on a Wednesday or so on.

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:32.640
 That's amazing.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.960
 But then if it's a bank holiday, do you turn up on the

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.200
 green day wearing something blue and everyone's like...

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.200
 Oh, it's so embarrassing.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.760
 It's like turning up to non-uniform day,

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:44.720
 forgetting that it's happened and wearing a uniform, isn't it?

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.320
 Oh, God, it's the stuff of nightmares.

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:48.720
 I know what our colours are for all four of us here.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:49.600
 Oh, yeah.

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.360
 Of what day we were born on.

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:54.640
 So, Anna, you're blue.

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:55.760
 You were born on a Friday.

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:56.880
 Who was I now?

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:59.760
 Yeah, James, you were blue.

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:00.800
 You were born on a Friday.

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:02.400
 Hey, we're blue twins.

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.440
 Yeah.

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:04.800
 And I am a blue.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.640
 Hey, we're blue triplets.

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:07.600
 Nice one.

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:10.480
 This is so nice and cosy, and we're all friends.

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.160
 And we're all the same colour.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:13.040
 We're all meant to be.

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.960
 It's like we've been chosen by the university.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:16.000
 What day was I born?

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:16.800
 Then?

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:17.760
 You're purple.

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:18.560
 You're a Saturday.

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:21.520
 You're the ticky week you have to go.

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:26.240
 But we are now auditioning for someone to join the podcast

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.360
 who was born on a Friday.

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:28.800
 So if that's you, get in touch.

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:32.240
 Do you know someone whose middle name is Friday?

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.240
 Ooh.

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.280
 Is it someone really famous?

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:35.840
 I think that.

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:36.800
 No, I do. I do.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:39.040
 But only because of research, but let's pretend I don't.

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.160
 Yeah, yeah.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:42.000
 It's someone, it's a fictional character.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.400
 It's not, I know the horse in that riddle's first name is Friday.

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.160
 That's different, isn't it?

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:49.600
 He rode in on a Friday.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:49.920
 Yeah.

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:52.560
 It's not Man Friday, is it?

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:53.680
 Man Friday.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:55.440
 So he'd be called Friday, Friday.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.640
 Friday was his middle name.

00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:01.600
 But it's someone whose first name is a day of the week.

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:02.560
 So...

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:03.520
 Wednesday Adams.

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:04.640
 Wednesday Adams.

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:06.400
 So her middle name is Friday.

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.960
 And the reason that she's called Wednesday,

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:10.080
 I mean, I know Dan knows.

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.520
 Anyone know why she's called Wednesday?

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:14.800
 It's because Wednesday's child is full of woe,

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.440
 according to that rhyme.

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.320
 And so she was like the sad child.

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:21.520
 She was miserable.

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:21.760
 Yeah.

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:26.560
 In Ghana, you are named after the day of the week you're born on.

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:34.720
 So boys are named Kwadwo, Komla, Kwaku, Yor, Kofi, Kwami, Kwazi

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:35.600
 after the days of the week.

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.600
 And girls, they're a female equivalent of two,

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:42.880
 Adzoa, Abena, Aqwa, Ya, Fue, Amma and Aqosua.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.280
 And you get that name when you're born.

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:46.880
 And then you get another name a bit later on,

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.600
 but you keep your day name and it becomes your middle name.

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:52.160
 So you can tell from a birth certificate in Ghana what day it's born.

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:52.960
 Did you say Kofi?

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:54.320
 Is Kofi anan one of those?

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.520
 Maske.

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:56.720
 Yeah, I guess Kofi is.

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:57.760
 Kofi is one of the names.

00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:59.600
 That's the fifth of the list.

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:00.320
 Yeah.

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:03.520
 You just said, Andy, that you could know from a birth certificate

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:04.800
 what day the person was born.

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:05.760
 I hope I'm not saying it down.

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:11.360
 I was hoping we, I was hoping I'd slit that one past you.

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.360
 Typical, typical purple comment.

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:23.120
 I looked a bit into Wednesday specifically,

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:25.360
 because it's this underappreciated today.

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:30.480
 And I like the sort of stuff about the word Wednesday.

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.320
 It's basically the wrong word.

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:34.240
 So I've decided we should rename Wednesday.

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.880
 It's named after Odin, who was called Woden,

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:39.200
 who is the early Norse god.

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:44.640
 And it was named that because it was thought to be a parallel to Mercury,

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:47.280
 which is what so, Mercury and all those Romance languages,

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:49.040
 Wednesday is named after Mercury, the god.

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:54.720
 But I've recently been listening to the excellent audio book on Norse gods

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:55.920
 by Neil Gaiman.

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:59.120
 And Odin is nothing like Mercury.

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:04.880
 So Mercury is like a fun loving trickster, playful, wily.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.000
 Odin's not like that.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.920
 I think it should be Loki.

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:09.760
 So I'm going to start calling Wednesday Loki,

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:11.120
 and everyone's going to get confused.

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:15.280
 But the person who decided that it should be the equivalent,

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:16.880
 it should be Odin, was Tacitus.

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.640
 And this is in the first century.

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:22.240
 And it was when the Romans were kind of occupying bits of Germania,

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.680
 as it was called at the time.

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.840
 And he decided Odin was the equivalent.

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:28.000
 And it was because, and I just love this word,

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.600
 they're both psychopomps, Odin and Mercury.

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:34.640
 And a psychopomp, again a word I'm going to use a lot now,

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:39.120
 is the word for a deity who escorts people from Earth to the afterlife when they die.

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:40.160
 Wow.

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:41.920
 So that's a psychopomp.

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:43.280
 That's a great word.

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:47.600
 I thought that, let's say we're going to accept that it's Odin's day,

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:49.600
 rather than Loki's day.

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:52.640
 Let's just imagine that that's fine, which we all know now it isn't.

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:55.440
 From this moment, we are all calling it Loki's day.

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.120
 But let's imagine it was Odin's day.

00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:00.000
 Why is it not Odin's day?

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.440
 Why is it Odin's day?

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:06.640
 Like, it's because it was another name that was used in Germanic areas for Odin.

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:09.440
 But Odin had more than 150 different names,

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:13.200
 any one of which we could have chosen for Wednesday instead of Odin.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:16.960
 So we could have had Grim's day, a Grim day.

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:20.960
 Like for Wednesday, we could have had Skillfinger day.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:22.960
 That would have been good.

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:26.320
 We could have had Sada, Sada day.

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:28.240
 But I guess that was a bit too close to Saturday,

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.920
 so I decided not to go for it.

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:30.720
 That's great.

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:31.120
 But yeah.

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:33.200
 That's Skillfinger day.

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:33.920
 I take it back.

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:34.800
 It shouldn't be Loki's day.

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:36.000
 Let's call it Skillfinger day.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:36.880
 Skillfinger day.

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:38.720
 I love that.

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.720
 That's so good.

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.320
 Hey, what's your favourite day of the week, guys?

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.400
 It's obviously Friday.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.520
 Thursday.

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:46.800
 Oh, Dan, you nerd.

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:48.960
 Is it Thursday because we record the podcast on a Thursday?

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.640
 This is the highlight of your week.

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.160
 That's the best moment of my whole life.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:55.840
 No, I like the number four.

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:56.800
 Four is my favourite number.

00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:00.320
 And so that's the fourth day of the week to my week schedule.

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:02.080
 I know Sunday is technically the first day,

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:03.440
 so it should be Wednesday.

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:03.840
 James.

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:04.720
 Yeah.

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:07.520
 I think Monday is the first day officially,

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:09.920
 according to the International Standards Organization.

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:12.320
 So I think you're fine with having Thursday.

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:14.160
 In Russian, Thursday is Chepyorka,

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.840
 which means like fourth day.

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:17.280
 So it works there as well.

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:19.600
 My favourite, I think, probably Saturday,

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:21.280
 where I can just chill out and watch the football.

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:24.480
 OK, everyone's got good answers here,

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:27.280
 apart from Dan, whose answer is very weird, statistically.

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:33.760
 So 21% of young people say that Friday is their favourite day.

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:35.520
 Only 6% of young people like Sundays.

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:37.440
 And I think that rises as you get older.

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:39.120
 You start to appreciate Sunday a bit more.

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:40.320
 You're off the bacon binges.

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:45.600
 But Tuesday is just 1% of people's favourite day.

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.920
 And I think Thursday might be another 1%.

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.760
 It scores very low.

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.680
 Do you know why no one likes Tuesday?

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:54.560
 Because we were saying that Wednesday was named after Odin.

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:56.480
 And Odin was a pretty cool god, right?

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:58.000
 He was the king of the gods and stuff.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.600
 Do you know who Tuesday was named after?

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:00.480
 No.

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:04.720
 Tuesday was named after a god called Tia,

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:07.600
 who is one of the most obscure gods.

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:10.480
 We have literally no idea anything about this guy.

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:15.040
 We only have one myth of him that's left.

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:16.960
 We don't really know anything about him at all.

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:19.920
 And there was a wolf, who was a baby wolf,

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:21.600
 but it was growing really, really quickly.

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:24.640
 And the gods were worried that this wolf was going to get so big,

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:25.760
 he was going to eat them all.

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:28.640
 And so they said, right, we're going to have to tie him down.

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.560
 So we're going to tie him in a load of ropes and stuff,

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.640
 and like magic god chains.

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:36.080
 But when Fenrir the wolf saw the chains,

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:38.720
 he didn't trust that anything was going to happen.

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:42.960
 So he said, OK, well, I'll kind of come and say hi.

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.840
 But only if one of you puts your arm down my throat,

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:49.440
 because then I'll trust that you're not going to chain me up.

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:54.720
 And so Tia, the god, who Tuesday's named after,

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.800
 decided, OK, well, in good faith,

00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:59.440
 I'll be the one who puts my arm down your throat.

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:01.280
 And then, of course, they chain the wolf up

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:02.480
 and the wolf bit his arm off.

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:07.840
 That's the only story we have about the guy who Tuesday's named after.

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:11.200
 It's such an important moral to that story.

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:12.960
 Don't put your arm down a wolf's throat.

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:14.720
 That is an important lesson.

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.160
 Yeah, that's true.

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:17.040
 Yes.

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:19.200
 Without that, wolf arm casualties

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.640
 would be way higher than they are.

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:23.680
 I've got one last thing before we move on,

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:27.600
 which is, remember, we were talking about that one dickhead

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:33.840
 who gets the colour on as they rock up to a sort of school in Thailand?

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.760
 I'm afraid I'm that dickhead.

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:36.000
 What?

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.080
 Because I was born on a Saturday, it turns out.

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:42.240
 Where are you? So what colour are you?

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:43.920
 I'm purple. I'm with Andy.

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:44.320
 Welcome, Ben.

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:45.760
 You traitor.

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:46.960
 I can't believe it.

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.240
 Have you just been doubled?

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.680
 Did you have a feeling, as you said that?

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:51.600
 I bet I've got that wrong, as well, since I've done anything wrong.

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:54.880
 Oh, we just tried to get in Mayan and Anna's cool club

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:56.320
 by pretending to be a blue.

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.640
 I was trying to be a blue, yeah.

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:01.440
 Yeah. No, I had a weird feeling come over me.

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:02.640
 I thought, "I don't feel very blue."

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:06.960
 I had a quick Google, it turns out.

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:10.560
 I mean, it's so in line with my facts.

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:17.040
 Is this a situation where your whole life you thought you were born on a Friday

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:18.480
 and you've only just realised?

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:20.080
 Or was it a fact that you thought,

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.760
 "I know what day I was born, I'm going to Google it,"

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.360
 and you just got the wrong answer on Google?

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:23.920
 Oh, which one?

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:25.360
 I got the wrong answer on Google, yeah.

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:26.880
 I double checked it on a different site,

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:28.480
 just as we were talking, because it just felt wrong.

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:31.440
 And I had a memory, just a memory of Saturday.

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:35.600
 I remember seeing the newspaper as I came out.

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:45.280
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Anna.

00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:49.760
 My fact this week is that according to Vietnamese historians,

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:53.920
 Chinese forces were once defeated by a woman who had breast so long

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.400
 she had to throw them over her shoulders in battle.

00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:02.160
 And this is, I think this is the second part we've had on the podcast about

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:04.960
 women with breast so long they had to throw them over their shoulders.

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.080
 One was a yeti.

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:07.360
 Yeah, one's a yeti.

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:08.080
 Female yeti.

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:11.040
 They have to throw them over their shoulders before they chase you

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:13.280
 or they might trip on them and throw it themselves.

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:14.240
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:15.120
 Possibly.

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:18.480
 Can I ask, is this lady as real as a yeti?

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:21.360
 I would say she's more real than a yeti.

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:24.400
 So I'm going to say this fact is less of a nonsense fact than Dan's

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:27.360
 because it's recorded by historians,

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:30.080
 and it's about almost certainly historical figure.

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:33.840
 But I still find it hard to believe that this breast thing actually happened,

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:38.480
 but this, so this is this warrior called Lady Chu, or Lady Trieu,

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:39.760
 as we'd anglicise it.

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:41.440
 And she is amazing.

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:42.880
 And she's a hero in Vietnam.

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:48.240
 In the third century, she led this revolt against the invading Chinese Wu state.

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:53.440
 And the writing about her from almost contemporary said that she was this

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:57.440
 extraordinary figure and her features included four foot long breasts,

00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:00.160
 which either she tossed over her shoulders to get them out the way,

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:03.760
 or sometimes she tied them to her torso so they didn't get out the way of her.

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:07.360
 It's interesting because I read in one account that they said that she had

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:09.600
 three breasts that were four feet long.

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:10.240
 Yes.

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:13.040
 So I can imagine how two of them can be throttled over the shoulder,

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:14.880
 but the other one's going to hit you in the face, isn't it?

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.160
 When you... It is.

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:16.320
 Yeah.

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:18.160
 Maybe that's the one she strapped her stomach.

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:18.240
 Maybe.

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:20.320
 Because, yeah, I've seen a painting of her with the third,

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:22.320
 sneaky third breast hanging down there.

00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:24.560
 OK, so we're not disputing the length of the boobs.

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:26.480
 We've actually just cracked that she had three,

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:30.000
 and both of these points about going over the shoulders and around the stomach are true.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:30.640
 Well, also...

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:31.360
 That's exciting.

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:33.360
 Nine feet tall was the other thing as well.

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:35.200
 So I think, you know...

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:39.040
 Yeah, this is a sort of tradition in Vietnam where some

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:41.760
 historic warriors take on this mythical status,

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:45.280
 and then they are written up as becoming more and more godlike.

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:47.520
 So, yeah, she was written up as being nine feet tall.

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:49.440
 She could walk over 1,000 miles in a day.

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:52.800
 But there are various things we think she probably did do,

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:54.880
 like rode elephants into battle.

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:57.360
 So rode on an elephant's head.

00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:59.920
 The stories say she fought with a sword in each hand.

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:02.000
 Again, probably why she had to tie down her breasts,

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.240
 because otherwise you're in danger of slicing one off, aren't you?

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:04.720
 Oh, yeah.

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:05.840
 Mmm.

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:08.240
 She had a voice as loud as a temple bell.

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:11.440
 So, but I think she probably did exist,

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:14.800
 although oddly, she's not mentioned in Chinese sources,

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:16.960
 whereas she's mentioned a lot in Vietnamese sources.

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:19.680
 But I think for China, this was just a...

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:22.960
 You don't really want to write about these people who defeated you a lot,

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:25.760
 especially if it's this woman with extraordinary breasts.

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:29.280
 Whereas in Vietnam, it was much more of a great thing to record.

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:32.960
 Although there is one thing that a lot of the women got written out of history

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:33.840
 in China, didn't they?

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:37.040
 When Neo-Confucianism came in,

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:39.120
 they kind of changed the rules a little bit.

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:41.440
 So women had to be at home

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:44.960
 and had to have this exact role in society.

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.800
 And so a lot of the historians in China

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:49.280
 wrote out all of the women in history, I think,

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:51.520
 the man that was 10th century or something.

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:52.880
 It was, I think it was before that.

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:55.760
 And Vietnamese society used to be much more equal,

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:57.200
 in fact, impressively equal,

00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:59.360
 until it was sort of from the 1st century,

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:01.760
 Chinese started really encroaching.

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:02.960
 And like you say, it was Confucianism.

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:05.200
 They really liked nuclear families.

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:06.960
 It was just all the same old stories, isn't it?

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:09.760
 Nuclear families, women subservient to men.

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:12.000
 Whereas Vietnamese society was much more clown-based.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.200
 It was quite matriarchal.

00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:17.040
 Some people say that it was actually more women-led than man-led.

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:22.400
 And so it wasn't totally unusual for the idea of female warriors and female fighters.

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:24.800
 So she was eventually defeated.

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.640
 And there's a kind of myth about how she was defeated,

00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:28.720
 which is really nice.

00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:30.880
 Well, it's maybe a slightly sexist myth, actually.

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:32.720
 The myth is that she was very fastidious,

00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:34.800
 and that the Chinese general who defeated her

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:37.120
 sent his men out of the fortress naked,

00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:38.880
 kicking up all the dirt and grime.

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:42.400
 And she was so horrified by this that she left the battlefield.

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:43.600
 And then her men all panicked,

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:46.800
 because obviously the nine-foot warrior general has run away.

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:48.080
 And that's why they were defeated.

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:51.600
 But it feels slightly like she can't cope with a bit of grime.

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:54.000
 Yeah, as the man's willies.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.960
 Yeah, that was Chinese historians who said

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:59.120
 the men exposed their genitals and scared her off.

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:03.360
 Which, interestingly, was also claimed of the Trung sisters,

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:05.120
 who were some other Vietnamese warriors.

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:07.760
 And it was said they were defeated when men showed them their balls.

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:13.120
 Well, there was this idea that you could scare these people away with penises, wasn't there?

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:17.520
 Because there is the really funny story of the Chinese commander

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:21.600
 who, after Lady Trieu died, started having nightmares

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:25.680
 where she came to him in his dreams and was saying that she was going to kill him.

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:31.600
 And so to keep her away, he hung a hundred wooden penises outside his house

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:33.520
 so that she wouldn't come to him in his dreams.

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:39.360
 I mean, that takes a lot of explaining away, doesn't it,

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:41.360
 when your relatives come round to visit.

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:44.560
 Whenever a hundred wooden penises outside your house.

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:48.240
 Well, I just saw it in Homes and Gardens last week.

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:53.760
 They had a special offer on which, if you buy one, you get 99 free.

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:59.600
 Well, what about the Trung sisters then, Anna, who you just mentioned?

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:01.440
 Oh, yeah, they're cracking as well.

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.760
 Again, these are real Vietnamese heroes, aren't they?

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:04.720
 Worshiped in Vietnam.

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:08.800
 So this was the first century, a couple of hundred years before Chu.

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:11.440
 And they were Trung Trac and Trung Nhi.

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:14.880
 And they defeated an invading Chinese army.

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:18.160
 And they actually conquered 65 cities in the end.

00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:20.000
 And this is about AD 40.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.960
 And Trung Trac became queen.

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:24.480
 And apparently she was a lovely queen.

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:26.240
 She had quite a soft rule.

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:29.280
 She tried to restore a lot of Vietnamese practices.

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:31.840
 And yeah, they're amazing.

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:34.400
 And the idea is that they were raised by their mother,

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:36.640
 who taught them just like you teach men.

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:40.000
 And so taught them how to fight, taught them lots of military skills.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.600
 Yeah.

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:44.720
 And these 65 cities that they conquered,

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:49.040
 the head of each city became like the head of one of their armies,

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:51.600
 almost, or one of their groups, all women.

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:54.800
 So they had 65 female generals who would fight

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.240
 in the wars against the Chinese.

00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:58.480
 One of which was the mum, right?

00:36:58.480 --> 00:36:59.280
 Yes, exactly.

00:36:59.280 --> 00:36:59.920
 Oh, really?

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:02.560
 Oh, they're like the Kardashians in that sense.

00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:06.000
 The momager figure is still very important to them.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:06.960
 Very much like that.

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:08.720
 But just exactly like that, yeah.

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:11.760
 They once killed a tiger so that they could write

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:13.760
 a promise to the people of Vietnam on its skin.

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:16.960
 If you've run out of paper, sometimes it's all you can do.

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:21.520
 I think Khloe Kardashian did that once, actually.

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:27.440
 And these Trang sisters were descendants of Lạc Long Quân,

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:33.600
 who was the original dragon lord, who is, according to the creation myth of Vietnam,

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:35.760
 he was the founder of the Vietnamese people.

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:40.960
 He married an immortal fairy called Au Cô, and they got married.

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:46.960
 And she laid 100 eggs who gave birth to the 100 noble families of Vietnam.

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:50.240
 And they became the elite of the Vietnamese society.

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:52.720
 50 of them preferred to live in the mountains.

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:55.360
 50 of them preferred to live by the sea.

00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:58.160
 And they kind of split into these two groups of...

00:37:58.160 --> 00:37:59.760
 It's a bit custody battle, isn't it?

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:00.560
 It's a bit...

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:02.240
 Custody was made out of eggs, or...

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:06.160
 No, you're right.

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:09.280
 It's like half of the people went with the dragon lord,

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:12.400
 and half of them went with the immortal fairy and his families.

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:14.800
 That would have made a cracking version of that film,

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:16.080
 the parent trap, wouldn't it?

00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:18.560
 Where you've got to get your parents back together,

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.560
 but they're a dragon lord and an immortal fairy.

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:22.960
 I watched the parent trap last weekend.

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:23.920
 That's so weird.

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:24.960
 Which version?

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:28.080
 The new one with Lindsay Lohan.

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:28.960
 Sorry, heathen.

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:29.920
 Now, you say new.

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:30.800
 That's pretty old.

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:33.520
 When I said that Moulin Rouge was a recent film,

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:36.320
 I got the crap kicked out of me on this podcast.

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:37.840
 At its comparison, you knew?

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:39.120
 New compared to the old one.

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:43.680
 I said that Moulin Rouge was recent, compared with the history of film,

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:45.040
 and it didn't cut any ice.

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:50.240
 Anyway, my point is it would have been vastly improved

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:52.800
 if it included some kind of dragon lord feature.

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:54.960
 So it's a good comparison.

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:58.400
 I've got a couple of things on modern Vietnamese women,

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:01.440
 sort of, who are pretty interesting today.

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:03.840
 So I found this really interesting thing,

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:06.000
 which is the nail industry in America,

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.840
 so for manicures and so on,

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:11.680
 approximately 51% of nail technicians in America

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:13.520
 are Vietnamese descendants.

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:16.880
 So either Vietnamese-American or have moved over there.

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:18.560
 80% in California.

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:21.840
 And this only happened in the last 40 years,

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:24.000
 and it's as a result, as far as we know,

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.280
 of one single person, which is Tippi Hedren.

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:29.680
 Now, Tippi Hedren, the actor,

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:32.560
 the actor who was in the Alfred Hitchcock movies.

00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:34.160
 She's the mother of Melanie Griffiths.

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:35.360
 Yeah, she was in The Birds.

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:40.320
 She was at refugee camp for Vietnamese in California 40 years ago.

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.040
 And while she was there,

00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:42.640
 she thought it'd be good to teach a skill,

00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:44.560
 and she noticed that they were all very obsessed

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:45.600
 with her beautiful nails.

00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:47.840
 She had them beautifully manicured and painted,

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:48.960
 and they all wanted to look at it.

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:51.120
 So she brought her manicurist in,

00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:53.600
 and a lot of the women who were there as refugees

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:55.840
 were part of the military intelligence.

00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:57.360
 So they were sort of high-ranking women,

00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:00.320
 a lot of influence, and they all got taught how to do this.

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:04.000
 And over 40 years, that spread to be a proper way

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.680
 of earning your money in America for them,

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:09.680
 to the point where it's now 51% of them all descended from this,

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:11.840
 supposedly from this one refugee camp

00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:14.080
 that Tippi Hedrin just happened to say,

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:15.840
 "Who wants to learn how to do this?"

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:16.960
 That is incredible.

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:17.680
 Remarkable.

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:18.800
 That could be also different

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:21.120
 if Tippi Hedrin had brought something else.

00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:24.080
 Well, if she taught them, I don't know, bowling,

00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:28.400
 it could be like 80% of bowling champions in America

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:31.440
 are descended from Vietnamese refugees.

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:33.200
 Oh, thank God it was her and not you.

00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:34.640
 I feel like Tippi Hedrin had her eye

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:36.640
 on the commercial market a bit more than you did.

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.720
 The demand for bowling tutors wasn't quite what it should be.

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:42.960
 There is money in bowling if you're good, Anna.

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:43.440
 And if you...

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:45.760
 The problem is that in America,

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:48.480
 there's so many people who already do bowling

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:51.360
 that even if you have been taught by Tippi Hedrin,

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:54.000
 it's still going to be quite hard to break into that elite,

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.360
 I'm going to say.

00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:56.960
 Yeah, I do see what you mean there.

00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:58.000
 It's a problem.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:58.800
 Okay, yeah.

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:02.000
 I won't try and start this.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.640
 The first female billionaire in Vietnam was not too long ago,

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:08.160
 and it was as a result of something

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:11.120
 which actually slightly sets women back,

00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:13.600
 I would say, via jet air.

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:15.040
 There was this thing, I don't know if you remember,

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:17.120
 the bikini-clad flight attendants.

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:20.000
 This was the idea that they would all dress in bikinis,

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.680
 and it became very popular because...

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:22.880
 They all have three breasts.

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:29.360
 Wait, so she made her money off that airline?

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:31.440
 Yeah, she made it go public,

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:33.760
 and when it went public, it turned her into a billionaire.

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:37.360
 And she's the first-ever billionaire from Vietnam.

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:38.880
 See, I mean, do you mind about that?

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:42.080
 I like women, but I hate billionaires.

00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:43.440
 It's difficult.

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:44.560
 That is tough.

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:46.160
 Well, luckily, there's not many of them.

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:47.920
 Luckily, most of the billionaires are men.

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:51.200
 Yeah, thank God, I still like most women.

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:55.120
 So it's really interesting, I find, about Vietnamese history,

00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:57.840
 which is the fact that it's kind of historical,

00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:01.360
 but at the same time, so much of it is very obviously folklore

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:04.880
 and not real, and trying to work out what is which.

00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:07.360
 And I suppose that's quite a lot of similarity

00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:09.120
 with things like the Amazons, right,

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:12.800
 which were largely thought to be quite a mythological group

00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:16.240
 of women who were like warriors who attacked the Greeks

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:17.680
 and attacked various different people,

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:19.120
 but actually, the more we look at it,

00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:21.200
 the more we think that there might have been some truth in it.

00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:25.120
 So there's this group of people who lived around Ukraine

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:27.600
 and around all the way up to Siberia,

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:29.840
 and from around the 9th century BC,

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:31.520
 they were attacking the Greeks

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:33.680
 and attacking a lot of different groups around there,

00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:36.240
 but because they were a nomadic tribe,

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:37.520
 you can't really say,

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:39.840
 "Well, this group of society will stay at home,

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:41.680
 and this group of society will go to battle."

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:43.840
 Basically, everyone had to go everywhere,

00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:45.920
 and so all the women got taught how to fight,

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.920
 and we know this because a lot of burials

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:50.080
 have been found of Scythian women,

00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:52.800
 and about one third of them have been buried with weapons,

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:55.760
 which suggests that they will have been warriors.

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:59.120
 And so we think now that a lot of the Amazonian stories

00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:01.600
 that came through classical times

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:04.160
 might have been referring to the Scythian women.

00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:05.120
 -Really? -Yeah.

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:06.240
 That makes sense.

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:07.520
 Kind of interesting.

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:09.360
 And because of their horse-riding skills,

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:12.720
 they could deliver any package with one-day delivery.

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:15.040
 That was the Amazonian promise back in the day.

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:24.080
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show,

00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:25.280
 and that is my fact.

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:28.880
 My fact this week is that one of the few incredibly rare times

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:32.160
 a giant squid has been seen attacking an ocean vessel,

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:34.720
 which was an image made famous by Jules Verne,

00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:38.720
 was in 2003 when a boat was attacked while competing

00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:40.640
 in the Jules Verne Trophy race.

00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:42.480
 Amazing.

00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:44.560
 What incredible coincidence.

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:46.640
 So this was, I should say,

00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:49.680
 that this was reported by the captain of this ship

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:52.480
 taking part in this race, Olivier de Casalsen,

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:55.520
 and he is a captain who's had over 40 years

00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:57.040
 of experience in the ocean,

00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:00.000
 and he was taking his boat on this trip

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.080
 when suddenly it kind of ground to a halt.

00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:03.840
 He was thinking, "What the hell is going on?"

00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:08.240
 And he saw through the port hole this giant squid,

00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:09.200
 which was attached to it.

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:10.880
 He's never seen anything like this in his life.

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:12.560
 He quickly radioed it in saying,

00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:14.720
 "We've got a giant squid that's attached to the boat."

00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:17.200
 They brought it to a complete halt,

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:18.640
 so they stopped it completely,

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:21.760
 and it sort of just disattached itself and went off,

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:23.200
 and that's the last that we saw of it.

00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:24.560
 So we don't have a photo.

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:27.600
 We don't have anything that can sort of completely verify

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:30.640
 other than his experience as a sailor

00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:32.000
 and as a good sailor as well.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.040
 So the Jules Verne trophy is to try and beat the record

00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:36.560
 of going around the world, isn't it?

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:38.560
 Did he beat the record, do you know?

00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:39.280
 Or...

00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:41.200
 So the way the Jules Verne trophy works

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:44.960
 is you hand over the trophy to someone who beats the record.

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:46.720
 Weirdly, there's a world record,

00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:48.160
 which is separate to the Jules Verne,

00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:50.880
 so you have to specifically pay up to this membership group.

00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:53.280
 So he did not win it that year in 2003,

00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:55.120
 but he did win it in 2004.

00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:58.400
 So what I'm thinking, Dan, is in 2003,

00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:00.240
 he's sailing around the world.

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:01.520
 He hasn't beaten the record,

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:03.040
 and when he comes back, he says,

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:05.840
 "Well, it's because I got attacked by a giant squid."

00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:07.680
 And they say, "Do you have any photos of it?"

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:09.520
 And he goes, "No, I don't have any photos,

00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:10.960
 but I got attacked by a giant squid,

00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:12.880
 and that's why I didn't win the race."

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:15.520
 And I'm not saying that he's lying.

00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:18.160
 I'm just saying that I'd like some evidence.

00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:20.720
 I agree, and I would love to see some three-foot boobs.

00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:24.240
 We can't all have what we want.

00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:26.800
 No, that's absolutely true.

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:28.000
 It's not the first thing you do.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.520
 If the first thing you do when you're being attacked

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:31.280
 by a giant squid is take a photo of it,

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:33.760
 then you're one of those irritating millennial types

00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:35.280
 who's always got your iPhone on you,

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:37.280
 and actually, they're a big fish to fry,

00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:38.560
 like getting it off your boat.

00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:40.400
 I'm with this guy.

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:42.960
 You know the Jules Verne trophy that you mentioned, Dan?

00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:44.080
 Yeah.

00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:47.440
 It floats, but it doesn't float just in water.

00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:49.120
 It floats in air.

00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:50.880
 What?

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:52.400
 This is so cool.

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:54.800
 The Jules Verne trophy is a metal sculpture

00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:55.600
 of a ship's hull, right?

00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:56.240
 And it's quite long.

00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:58.400
 It looks like it's about six or eight feet long.

00:45:58.400 --> 00:45:59.920
 And at the ceremony where you hand it over,

00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:02.000
 because you have to hand it over to the next people to win it,

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.440
 everyone puts on gloves,

00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:06.640
 and you take it out of its case where it is floating

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:08.080
 on top of a magnetic field.

00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:10.400
 You hand it to the guys who've won it,

00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:13.200
 and they put it back in this huge glass case

00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:14.240
 in a magnetic field,

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:16.800
 so it just hovers there in mid-air,

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:18.240
 and then they put it away again.

00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:18.960
 That's quite cool.

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:19.840
 It's a floating trophy.

00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:20.400
 Isn't that awesome?

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:21.920
 Why does it?

00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:24.080
 Because of the magnetic field.

00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:25.360
 Yeah, but just because it's cool, right?

00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:26.320
 That's the idea.

00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:27.200
 Yeah, because it's cool.

00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:27.200
 Yeah.

00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:28.240
 Great.

00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:28.880
 That's Jules Verne.

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:30.240
 He's a science fiction writer.

00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:30.480
 Well, here's the thing.

00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:32.160
 It's a cool science fiction thing.

00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:34.800
 Jules Verne, the reason that this is named after him

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:37.040
 is because it's around the world in 80 days, right?

00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:38.400
 Which is what he wrote.

00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:40.160
 Can you name any kind of transport

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:42.960
 that Philius Fogg used in around the world in 80 days?

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:44.160
 Balloon, hot air balloon.

00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:44.880
 Hot air balloon.

00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:46.080
 Amazingly not, right?

00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:49.920
 In the book, he doesn't go in a hot air balloon at any stage.

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:51.040
 It's so weird.

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:53.840
 It's if you look at in all the Disney films,

00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:55.120
 he's always in a hot air balloon.

00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:57.440
 And if you look at like lots of the books

00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:58.720
 with an illustration on the front,

00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:00.160
 there's always a hot air balloon in it

00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:01.600
 or on the post or whatever.

00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:04.080
 But no, he just goes by train and by boat.

00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:05.600
 I mean, it would be a much more boring Disney film,

00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:05.920
 wouldn't it?

00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:07.280
 Just a guy getting trains around.

00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:10.400
 It's a commute.

00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:10.960
 It's a film.

00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:12.720
 That's a Michael Portello documentary,

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:15.680
 not the most thrilling novel of the 19th century.

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:16.480
 That's fascinating.

00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:19.600
 I think the first thing he wrote was about balloon, wasn't it?

00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:21.200
 It was a short story about a cool something,

00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:22.240
 like adventures in a balloon.

00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:25.200
 And I feel like people must have conflated those,

00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:28.880
 an inflated, conflated and inflated balloon.

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:31.520
 You don't inflate a balloon.

00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:33.200
 One of those hot air balloons, do you?

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:33.840
 Don't you?

00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:34.400
 You certainly do.

00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:34.960
 Yeah.

00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:37.440
 That wasn't the main problem with that joke, I have to say.

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:39.840
 The technical issue.

00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:41.840
 Yeah, right.

00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:43.200
 It had it.

00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:45.200
 Jules Verne had an amazing life, didn't he?

00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:45.680
 Yeah.

00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:46.880
 I loved the fact as a boy,

00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:48.800
 his uncle was the mayor of Brains.

00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:50.000
 Really?

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:50.720
 Yeah.

00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:54.000
 I'm not sure I'm pronouncing the French town of Brains correctly.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:54.720
 Oh, really?

00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:55.680
 How's the spell?

00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:56.800
 It's spell Brains.

00:47:56.800 --> 00:48:01.520
 He was mates with Alexandre Dumas, amongst other people,

00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:03.360
 who was this great inspiration for him.

00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:08.160
 And actually, kind of sadly, Dumas' son once wrote to Jules Verne,

00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:13.120
 saying that he considered Verne the true son of Dumas over himself,

00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:16.960
 which shows a real lack of self-confidence.

00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:18.480
 What did he write?

00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:19.760
 He wrote Musketeers, was that it?

00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:21.120
 Yeah, and Monte Cristo.

00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:21.680
 Yes.

00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:24.240
 Sorry, Andy, for your pronunciation in French,

00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:26.320
 you might know him as an Alexandre Dumas.

00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:33.840
 Do you guys know how Jules Verne and Dumas first met, apparently?

00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:36.640
 In a hot air balloon.

00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:37.440
 Nice.

00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:38.960
 It's almost as cool.

00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:41.600
 This is actually something that was sent in by a listener

00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:45.040
 called Elly's Cramer, and it's from a 1954 article

00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:48.480
 about a party that Verne was at, where he was kind of bored

00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:50.960
 and he was a bit of a rogue.

00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:55.280
 And I think he was referred to as witty and impudent in the article.

00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:58.320
 And so he decided to leave, and he left by sliding down the banister.

00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:02.080
 Slid down the banister, smashed straight into someone at the bottom,

00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:05.280
 like smashed into his torso, so stood up, didn't know what to say.

00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:07.040
 So the first thing that came to his head said,

00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:08.320
 "Have you had dinner?"

00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:10.240
 Quite an odd thing to say to a stranger.

00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:12.240
 And the man replied he'd had an omelet,

00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:15.920
 at which Verne said no one could make an omelet as well as he could.

00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:18.560
 And so this guy was like, "All right, you make such a good omelet.

00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:21.120
 Make me an omelet. I'll come around for dinner next Wednesday."

00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:22.800
 And he gave him...

00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:24.000
 It's the story.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.400
 It's a true story.

00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:31.120
 This guy handed over his business card, and it was Alexandre Dumas.

00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:35.600
 This sounds like, you know, if you and your partner met on Tinder or something,

00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:37.440
 and you're like, "Well, we're going to have to come up with a story

00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:39.440
 "when everybody asks us how we met."

00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:43.600
 I'll say that I made an omelet. You say you were coming down the banister.

00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:47.200
 Yeah. Omelet was the original eggplant emoji, I think.

00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:49.760
 Seems there was a sexual thing going on there.

00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:53.760
 So the thing about Jules Verne is, in Britain,

00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:57.440
 I would say we kind of see him as more of a kid's author, right?

00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:02.640
 Because I certainly read a lot of his stuff when I was a teenager or younger still.

00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:07.600
 And the reason is because he had really bad translations into English,

00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:11.600
 so in France and in Russia and in lots of different countries,

00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:13.600
 he's seen as quite a serious author.

00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:15.600
 But in Britain, he's more of a kid's author.

00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:18.560
 And these translations were just bad.

00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:22.560
 And the thing about his translations I find really interesting is

00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:26.560
 that the British ones were then translated into Japanese.

00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:32.560
 So in Japan, they get a translated version of the English stuff, not the French stuff.

00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:35.600
 I mean, obviously, these days, you get better translations.

00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:37.600
 But the original Japanese ones.

00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:41.600
 And then in China, they translated the Japanese ones,

00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:45.600
 which had been translated from English, which had been translated from French.

00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:49.600
 So you get this weird sort of Chinese whispers things going on.

00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:53.600
 But also in Chinese kind of oral tradition, as a storyteller,

00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:57.600
 you would kind of add your own little footnotes and stuff like that, right?

00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:01.600
 And so the original French one section of, I think,

00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:05.600
 I've not written down what bucket is, but I think it's around the world in 80 days.

00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:07.600
 And really apologies for my French here.

00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:09.600
 But it says something like,

00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:21.600
 [speaking French]

00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:25.600
 So it says, after the Civil War, a new club that was very influential

00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:29.600
 was established in Baltimore, which is in Maryland.

00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:34.600
 And the Chinese version becomes anyone who has studied world geography and history

00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:36.600
 knows of a place called America.

00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:40.600
 As for the American War of Independence, not the Civil War, by the way,

00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:43.600
 even children know that it was an earth-shattering event,

00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:46.600
 a deed that ought to be recalled often and never forgotten.

00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:49.600
 Now, among all those states that participated in the war,

00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:53.600
 one of them was called Maryland, whose capital, Baltimore, not the capital,

00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:58.600
 was a famous city teeming with crowds and packed with the traffic of horses and carriages

00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:01.600
 in this city was a club, magnificent in appearance,

00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:06.600
 and as soon as you saw the high-flying American flag flapping in the wind in front,

00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:09.600
 you naturally felt a sense of awe.

00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:13.600
 Amazing translation of that one sentence.

00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:17.600
 And someone who doesn't want to be a translator, they want to be an author.

00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:19.600
 A translation.

00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:22.600
 Also being paid by the word.

00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:26.600
 And the only thing people are going to write in about is the reference to Maryland

00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:28.600
 Oh, Maryland, yeah.

00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:30.600
 I'll be furious, James.

00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:32.600
 Pronouncing things.

00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:35.600
 Not so easy now, is it?

00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:39.600
 There was a guy who claimed to be the real Philius Fogg,

00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:41.600
 who was called George Francis Train.

00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:44.600
 We've mentioned him once before, actually, I think.

00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:49.600
 So he went around the world in 1870, and then the book was published at about 1873,

00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:54.600
 give or take, but he had already travelled around the world supposedly in 80 days.

00:52:54.600 --> 00:53:00.600
 Yes, so he was 80 days travelling, but he stopped off in Paris for two months.

00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:04.600
 During his time, he was arrested and sent to prison for two weeks.

00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:08.600
 And I think it might have been Dumas who got him out of prison, actually.

00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:13.600
 But he was basically, it wasn't really an 80-day full trip.

00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:17.600
 But the first person who did it in under 80 days, I think, was Nellie Bly,

00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:20.600
 who did it in 1890, right?

00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:22.600
 And she did it in '72.

00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:23.600
 Yeah, that's right.

00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:26.600
 And released the book around the world in '72, Day.

00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:29.600
 Very unimaginative. I think you could sue her for that.

00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:33.600
 But she also, she pit-stocked and said hi to Jules Verne along the way.

00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:35.600
 How meta is that?

00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:39.600
 That is weird. It's like your book's coming to life in front of your very eyes.

00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:41.600
 So she was a journalist, right?

00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:46.600
 And she was working for, was it the New York World?

00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:48.600
 It was for Pulitzer, anyway.

00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:53.600
 So she was working for Pulitzer and she said, "I want to go around the world in 80 days

00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:56.600
 and I want to write my story about it."

00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:58.600
 She was an investigative journalist.

00:53:58.600 --> 00:54:03.600
 And the newspaper had a Nellie Bly guessing match where people could guess exactly how long it would take her

00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:08.600
 to get around the world by the minute.

00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:10.600
 And if you got the closest, then you'd win a prize.

00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:15.600
 And she travelled by ship, train and donkey, the three things that she used.

00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:19.600
 It feels like the ship and the train probably did most of the legs.

00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:24.600
 When she met Verne in Paris, she, he said, "You know, I'm so impressed by you.

00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:31.600
 If you manage to do this in 79 days, I'll applaud with both hands."

00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:34.600
 I'll ask you a question, what the alternative way of applauding is.

00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:38.600
 Yeah, she was cool. She, they didn't want to send her around at first, I don't think.

00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:41.600
 So she had this idea and she insisted on being sent around the world.

00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:46.600
 And first, the editor of the New York World said, "No, a woman can't do this, I'm afraid."

00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:52.600
 And she said very well, "Start the man and I'll start the same day for some other newspaper and beat him."

00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:57.600
 And so then they caved and she sort of put one outfit, few changes of underwear.

00:54:57.600 --> 00:54:59.600
 But she had a rival, didn't she?

00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:03.600
 This woman called Elizabeth Bisland, who was sent round by Cosmo.

00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:09.600
 And it was the sort of classy alternative to Nellie Bly who was racing her basically.

00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:13.600
 But Nellie didn't know to begin with, right? So she was engaged in a race she wasn't aware of.

00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:17.600
 And then when she found out, she just didn't care if she was like, "I'm not doing this for a race."

00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:22.600
 Oh really? Yeah, what? She claimed she didn't care, but she sprinted away when she was told.

00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:28.600
 I'd rather see if they're going to remake Around the World in 80 Days for one billionth time or whatever for Disney.

00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:35.600
 Then I would much rather see the Nellie Bly versus this woman from Cosmo trying to race around the world in 80 days

00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:37.600
 rather than some Philly as a card character.

00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:41.600
 It's not great spectator, I guess, because the race is very much two quite separate people.

00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:43.600
 You just have to keep cutting between them.

00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:47.600
 She said apparently the moment when she found out was in Hong Kong.

00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:51.600
 And so Nellie Bly arrived in Hong Kong and Elizabeth Bisland was beating her at the time.

00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:56.600
 And in fact, I think it was beating her until she got back to Britain where she was told she'd missed her boat,

00:55:56.600 --> 00:56:00.600
 which was actually a lie. She hadn't missed her boat. No one knows if that was a trick.

00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:03.600
 But when Nellie Bly got to Hong Kong, a guy who met her there said,

00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:06.600
 "Oh, are you the one that's racing the other person?"

00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:10.600
 And Nellie said, "Yeah, I'm in a race. I'm in a race with time."

00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:13.600
 And the guy said, "I don't think that was her name."

00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:17.600
 Thus she discovered.

00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:22.600
 It is a good premise for a film because one of them is all working for Cosmo.

00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:25.600
 It's all kind of high powered and doing it in high heels and it'll scrubbed up.

00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:29.600
 And the other one's Nellie Bly who's sort of a street urchin vibe to her.

00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:33.600
 That's what I was saying. It's amazing. And then it's a bit like Race Around the World,

00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:40.600
 where you make them have to stop in London and meet each other and stay in the same hotel and talk about, you know...

00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:43.600
 And they become friendly in the way.

00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:45.600
 Working up. Yeah, they become friends.

00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:50.600
 No, but they become enemies, but they respect each other like superheroes and super enemies.

00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:53.600
 Like forgers and their chasers.

00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:56.600
 Another part of Nellie Bly's life, which would have been a good movie,

00:56:56.600 --> 00:57:00.600
 is when she exposed all the insane asylums in America,

00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:08.600
 because she pretended to be insane and got herself committed to an asylum on Blackwells Island in New York.

00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:12.600
 And it was basically an expose of how badly treated these sick people were.

00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:17.600
 She showed that they were doing beatings and ice cold baths and forced meals,

00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:20.600
 including really rotten butter and rotten food.

00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:25.600
 And that actually changed the way that asylums works in America, thanks to her expose.

00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:28.600
 But she never got out. That's the sad thing.

00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:31.600
 She kept saying, "I'm a journalist. I've just been writing an expose."

00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:33.600
 Sure you are, yeah.

00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:36.600
 I've been around the world for 80 days. Yeah, right.

00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:42.600
 And the nurse turns around and suddenly you see it's Elizabeth Diskin standing there.

00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:45.600
 No!

00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:49.600
 Roll credit.

00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:53.600
 Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening.

00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:09.600
 Yep, but you can go to our group account, which is @NoSuchThing,

00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:13.600
 or our website, NoSuchThingAsAfish.com, where all of our previous episodes are,

00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:17.600
 as well as links to merchandise and links to any upcoming tour dates as well.

00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:21.600
 Also, our partners, Audio Boom, are currently conducting a survey

00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:24.600
 on how listeners like to listen to their podcasts.

00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:28.600
 And they've asked us if you could head to audioboom.com/survey

00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:31.600
 to tell them and answer their questions.

00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:33.600
 They are going to give out a nice prize.

00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:38.600
 It's a 50-pound voucher to Amazon for anyone who they select who has done the survey.

00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:41.600
 So you do have a chance to win that 50 pounds.

00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:46.600
 So if you do feel like going there and telling them how you listen to podcasts, please do.

00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:48.600
 And say that you like us lots.

00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:49.600
 Thank you very much.

00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:52.600
 Okay, we will be back again next week with another episode.

00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:54.600
 We will see you then. Goodbye.
