00:00:00,00:00:04,"Hi everybody, before we start this week's show, we all have an announcement for you."
00:00:04,00:00:08,Are we all gonna do it at once? Now let's do one word at a time.
00:00:08,00:00:10,"Okay, brilliant. That'll be fun, you know, like that amazing improv game."
00:00:10,00:00:11,"Oh, great, yeah."
00:00:11,00:00:14,So I'll go first. We have...
00:00:14,00:00:15,Written.
00:00:15,00:00:15,A.
00:00:15,00:00:17,New.
00:00:17,00:00:17,Book.
00:00:17,00:00:18,That's called...
00:00:18,00:00:23,"Oh, Jesus, come on, guys. Never mind. We've written the new book."
00:00:23,00:00:27,It's called Funny You Should Ask. It's available in all shops. It's really good.
00:00:27,00:00:29,"If you're looking for a last-minute Christmas gift,"
00:00:29,00:00:31,"I can't think of anything better, really."
00:00:31,00:00:36,It is. It's sort of a compilation of the weirdest questions that might spring to your mind in your
00:00:36,00:00:40,"very bored moments, things you've always wondered, things you've never wondered,"
00:00:40,00:00:42,"but now you're desperate to know the answer to, like,"
00:00:42,00:00:45,"who would win in a race out of a human, a fish, or a mermaid?"
00:00:45,00:00:49,"Or if I take a swan to the vet, does the queen have to pay?"
00:00:49,00:00:53,"Yeah, if spiders can walk on the ceiling, why can't they get out of the bath?"
00:00:53,00:00:55,Huge question. Always wondered about that.
00:00:55,00:00:59,"Why does cat food come in beef and lamb flavours, but not mouse flavour?"
00:00:59,00:01:00,Such a good question.
00:01:00,00:01:01,Yeah.
00:01:01,00:01:03,Buy it for your cat as a Christmas present.
00:01:03,00:01:04,Your cat wants to know.
00:01:04,00:01:07,"And this book, it's not just written by us for it."
00:01:07,00:01:11,"It's written by all the QILs, so a lot of the QILs that you'll know"
00:01:11,00:01:13,"because they've come on here, like Alex and Anne,"
00:01:13,00:01:17,"but loads of the other QILs that are just a complete mystery even to me,"
00:01:17,00:01:19,"even though I've been working with them for many, many years."
00:01:19,00:01:22,It's fun. It's a lovely blue colour and it's reasonably priced.
00:01:22,00:01:24,It could not be the more perfect Christmas present
00:01:24,00:01:26,to give you all the conversation you'll need.
00:01:26,00:01:29,"So get it for the facts, but mainly for the blue on the cover."
00:01:29,00:01:34,And it's available in bookshops and on the internet.
00:01:34,00:01:36,"You know how to buy a book, do it."
00:01:36,00:01:38,Funny you should ask by the QILs.
00:01:38,00:01:40,"OK, on with the podcast."
00:01:40,00:01:57,Hello and welcome to another episode
00:01:57,00:02:00,"of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:02:00,00:02:03,from four undisclosed locations in the UK.
00:02:03,00:02:04,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:02:04,00:02:07,"I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:02:07,00:02:08,and James Harkin.
00:02:08,00:02:11,"And once again, we have gathered round the microphones"
00:02:11,00:02:14,with our four favourite facts from the last seven days.
00:02:14,00:02:16,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:02:16,00:02:19,"Starting with you, Andy."
00:02:19,00:02:23,"My fact is, there is such a big market for fake letters by Abraham Lincoln"
00:02:23,00:02:26,that people have started selling fake fakes.
00:02:27,00:02:28,Wow.
00:02:28,00:02:30,Yeah. How cool is this?
00:02:30,00:02:35,There's a big old market for fake letters of Abraham Lincoln.
00:02:35,00:02:37,"People, he died in 1865."
00:02:37,00:02:41,And there were a load of scam artists in the 20s and 30s
00:02:41,00:02:46,"who started faking the letters and faking his signature,"
00:02:46,00:02:49,"using old paper, all these amazing tactics they used."
00:02:49,00:02:52,And those fake letters are now worth thousands of dollars
00:02:52,00:02:53,in their own right.
00:02:53,00:02:55,They've sold for thousands of dollars each.
00:02:56,00:02:58,"But obviously, that means there's a market."
00:02:58,00:03:02,And so people have started forging forgeries.
00:03:02,00:03:05,"And is it like Chinese whispers,"
00:03:05,00:03:08,where the fake fake fakes look absolutely nothing
00:03:08,00:03:10,like the original letters?
00:03:10,00:03:12,It's just a picture of a horse's ass.
00:03:12,00:03:15,"Yeah, Abraham Lincoln letters."
00:03:15,00:03:21,"But so these fake fakes, they have to be attributed"
00:03:21,00:03:23,"to the fake writer, right?"
00:03:23,00:03:26,So as in people who became famous in that period
00:03:26,00:03:29,for having written these fake letters in themselves
00:03:29,00:03:31,"have become celebrities in that world,"
00:03:31,00:03:34,and then they're buying fakes of the fake forwarders one.
00:03:34,00:03:36,It's not just a random fake.
00:03:36,00:03:37,"No, no, but also it's the fact"
00:03:37,00:03:39,that the real ones are so expensive.
00:03:39,00:03:40,Is that right?
00:03:40,00:03:43,"Like, if you're a person with a normal income"
00:03:43,00:03:46,"and you want to buy a Lincoln letter, you just can't afford it."
00:03:46,00:03:48,So the next best thing is to buy a fake one.
00:03:48,00:03:50,"Yeah, exactly."
00:03:50,00:03:50,"Yeah. And the weird thing is,"
00:03:50,00:03:54,there are so many Abraham Lincoln memorabilia collectors
00:03:54,00:03:54,in the USA.
00:03:54,00:03:56,It seems to be the national pastime.
00:03:56,00:04:00,"I always thought it was American football,"
00:04:00,00:04:03,but I turned on the TV on Thanksgiving
00:04:03,00:04:05,and it was just people passing around fake letters
00:04:05,00:04:06,to each other.
00:04:06,00:04:08,If you look closely at these stands
00:04:08,00:04:09,"in American football matches,"
00:04:09,00:04:12,they're all trading their Abraham Lincoln bits of beard.
00:04:12,00:04:16,"There are 15,000 collectors, apparently serious collectors"
00:04:16,00:04:19,"of memorabilia, not just your fly-by-night amateurs."
00:04:19,00:04:21,"50,000, Jesus."
00:04:21,00:04:23,"Yeah, which is 1,000 more than there are books written about."
00:04:23,00:04:25,"Apparently, there have been 14,000 books"
00:04:25,00:04:27,written about Abraham Lincoln.
00:04:27,00:04:28,"Still a lot, isn't it?"
00:04:28,00:04:32,"It's a record after Jesus and Napoleon, apparently."
00:04:32,00:04:33,Really interesting.
00:04:33,00:04:35,"I saw it when we were in Washington, D.C."
00:04:35,00:04:37,for our tour last year.
00:04:37,00:04:40,I saw a huge pillar at the Ford Theatre
00:04:40,00:04:42,where they have glued every single book
00:04:42,00:04:44,"that's been written about Lincoln,"
00:04:44,00:04:45,"or at least as many as they could get,"
00:04:45,00:04:48,to a pillar that extends to about four floors.
00:04:49,00:04:52,"We should say the most famous faker is Joseph Cozy, right?"
00:04:52,00:04:58,And is it mostly his that are being sold that are being forged?
00:04:58,00:05:02,So Joseph Cozy was sort of the big Lincoln faker
00:05:02,00:05:04,who was kind of an amazing guy.
00:05:04,00:05:05,So he started out.
00:05:05,00:05:06,He went into the Library of Congress.
00:05:06,00:05:08,He was really into American history and stuff.
00:05:08,00:05:11,And then he saw a pay warrant
00:05:11,00:05:13,that was endorsed by Benjamin Franklin.
00:05:13,00:05:14,So he had his signature on it.
00:05:14,00:05:17,"This was in 1929, and the pay warrant was from 1786."
00:05:17,00:05:18,And he took it.
00:05:18,00:05:20,And his argument when he was caught
00:05:20,00:05:22,"was that the Library of Congress belongs to the people,"
00:05:22,00:05:23,and he's one of the people.
00:05:23,00:05:24,So it's not actually stealing.
00:05:24,00:05:25,Anyway.
00:05:25,00:05:27,"Oh, wow. That's a good argument."
00:05:27,00:05:30,So he went to sell it to a dealer who told him it was fake.
00:05:30,00:05:32,He knew it wasn't fake.
00:05:32,00:05:35,So he basically devoted his life to making actual fakes
00:05:35,00:05:36,to screw over these idiot dealers
00:05:36,00:05:38,who couldn't tell the difference.
00:05:38,00:05:38,Wow.
00:05:38,00:05:41,"I mean, that must have been pretty hard for him to go in and say,"
00:05:41,00:05:43,"""No, it's not fake. I stole it from the Library of..."""
00:05:46,00:05:49,"Yeah, actually, I did buy it from a dodgy guy on the phone."
00:05:49,00:05:51,It's so weird.
00:05:51,00:05:54,This relationship he had with his arch enemy
00:05:54,00:05:56,"is a bit like, you know, in superhero films,"
00:05:56,00:05:57,which I don't watch.
00:05:57,00:06:00,"They, I think, the superhero, often,"
00:06:00,00:06:01,"as well as hating his arch enemy,"
00:06:01,00:06:03,"has this weird grudging respect for him,"
00:06:03,00:06:05,"and they'll have a chat at the end, you know,"
00:06:05,00:06:06,where they're bonding.
00:06:06,00:06:08,It's kind of like that happens.
00:06:08,00:06:09,"He had that with William Burquist,"
00:06:09,00:06:12,who was the investigator for the New York Public Library.
00:06:12,00:06:14,And it was him who spotted in 1933
00:06:14,00:06:17,"something dodgy was going on with the documents,"
00:06:17,00:06:19,"set up this big sting operation,"
00:06:19,00:06:21,"caught Cosy as he was trying to, like, escape"
00:06:21,00:06:23,"getting away with forging stuff,"
00:06:23,00:06:24,"and basically congratulated him,"
00:06:24,00:06:27,"brought him down to the police station, said, ""You're a genius."""
00:06:27,00:06:29,"And Cosy immediately was like, ""Oh, thanks."
00:06:29,00:06:30,"Well, you should see what I've done with this,"""
00:06:30,00:06:32,and pulled some little forgeries out of his pocket.
00:06:32,00:06:34,"I was like, ""Look at this."""
00:06:34,00:06:35,"And Burquist was like,"
00:06:35,00:06:37,"""Look, employ your talents better in future, please."
00:06:37,00:06:39,"Don't do it again. Off you go."""
00:06:39,00:06:40,"And Cosy disappeared,"
00:06:40,00:06:43,and immediately started forging loads and loads of stuff again.
00:06:43,00:06:45,"But they sort of hung out,"
00:06:45,00:06:47,as well as Burquist trying to stop these forgeries
00:06:47,00:06:49,getting into the market and trying to suppress him.
00:06:49,00:06:52,"They also, like, paid each other social calls sometimes."
00:06:52,00:06:54,He would occasionally give Cosy a bit of money
00:06:54,00:06:55,to help him on his way.
00:06:55,00:06:56,-Wow. -It's very weird.
00:06:56,00:06:58,"All right, it's weird."
00:06:58,00:06:59,Do you know how Cosy got started?
00:06:59,00:07:03,He got... He was in the Army originally.
00:07:03,00:07:04,Not originally.
00:07:04,00:07:07,"He joined the Army as a young man, I guess."
00:07:07,00:07:07,Not as a baby.
00:07:07,00:07:10,"Look, anyway, he got started..."
00:07:10,00:07:12,"That's why they call it the infantry, isn't it?"
00:07:12,00:07:13,(LAUGHS)
00:07:13,00:07:20,He got kicked out of the Army for assaulting a cook in his company.
00:07:20,00:07:21,"I don't know why he assaulted the cook,"
00:07:21,00:07:25,but he forged a certificate of honourable discharge from the Army
00:07:25,00:07:27,because he was obviously dishonorably discharged.
00:07:27,00:07:29,"And so that was, I think,"
00:07:29,00:07:32,one of his first steps on the road to forging all this other stuff.
00:07:32,00:07:35,"Yes, but he signed it as Abraham Lincoln, which was a bit confusing."
00:07:35,00:07:39,He never really made money from it.
00:07:39,00:07:40,He sold stuff quite cheap.
00:07:40,00:07:42,I think Cosy was nervous
00:07:42,00:07:44,"that if he tried to sell it really expensively,"
00:07:44,00:07:46,people would interrogate it more.
00:07:46,00:07:47,So he'd sell it quite cheap.
00:07:47,00:07:49,"And he said when he was questioned,"
00:07:49,00:07:53,the pleasure that he got was from seeing that forgery that he sold
00:07:53,00:07:55,climbing up and up the auction market
00:07:55,00:07:58,"and then selling for a huge amount in an auction house,"
00:07:58,00:08:01,"him sitting there at home, you know, tapping his fingers together,"
00:08:01,00:08:05,"going, ""Oh, I know that's just something I scribbled in my bathroom."""
00:08:05,00:08:06,Yeah.
00:08:06,00:08:08,"And he had a little bit of a loophole, didn't he?"
00:08:08,00:08:11,"Because he, in New York,"
00:08:11,00:08:14,it was illegal to kind of advertise something as being something it wasn't
00:08:14,00:08:15,and then selling it on.
00:08:15,00:08:17,"But if you went to someone and just said,"
00:08:17,00:08:20,"""Oh, I found this scribbled signature."
00:08:20,00:08:22,I don't know who it's by.
00:08:22,00:08:23,I don't know what it's on.
00:08:23,00:08:25,"I know it says Abraham Lincoln, but I don't know who did it."""
00:08:25,00:08:27,"Then, and you sold it to them,"
00:08:27,00:08:29,then technically that wasn't a felony.
00:08:29,00:08:31,So that's so clever.
00:08:31,00:08:32,Yeah.
00:08:32,00:08:32,"Well, we don't know."
00:08:32,00:08:34,"He might, I don't think he is,"
00:08:34,00:08:36,but there's a suggestion that he kept operating
00:08:36,00:08:39,for years and years after he went able
00:08:39,00:08:43,because he kind of dropped off the radar in 1943.
00:08:43,00:08:44,"But even in 1956,"
00:08:44,00:08:46,"the New Yorker wrote a piece saying,"
00:08:46,00:08:47,"""Is he still producing forgeries?"
00:08:47,00:08:48,"We don't know."""
00:08:48,00:08:49,"So you're saying he could,"
00:08:49,00:08:51,were you about to say he might still be around today
00:08:51,00:08:53,if you've actually got a signed copy
00:08:53,00:08:54,"of a ""Know Such Things as a Fish"" book?"
00:08:54,00:08:56,"Check it out, Joseph Cosy."
00:08:56,00:09:01,Do you know how you can tell if a Lincoln letter is fake?
00:09:01,00:09:03,No. How can you do that?
00:09:03,00:09:06,"Oh, there are so many exciting ways you can tell."
00:09:06,00:09:08,So one is what he wrote.
00:09:08,00:09:09,So if...
00:09:09,00:09:11,If he's talking about his iPad.
00:09:11,00:09:15,"That basically is one of the tips they give,"
00:09:15,00:09:17,"is what he, you know,"
00:09:17,00:09:20,"is it signed 1866 or later, in which case it's not real."
00:09:20,00:09:23,But another thing is just what he signed.
00:09:23,00:09:29,"So he never, ever signed Abe or Honest Abe or Old Abe."
00:09:29,00:09:31,That's just...
00:09:31,00:09:32,"Oh, the Abe Meister."
00:09:32,00:09:33,Exactly.
00:09:35,00:09:37,"It's either Abe Lincoln on letters,"
00:09:37,00:09:40,"or if he was a lawyer, he would just sign Lincoln."
00:09:40,00:09:41,So there are all these things.
00:09:41,00:09:45,"Also, if you wrote a letter on animal skin, then it's fake."
00:09:45,00:09:45,"Oh, really?"
00:09:45,00:09:46,Because a lot of presidential documents
00:09:46,00:09:48,"are on animal skin, or vellum,"
00:09:48,00:09:50,and their letters are on paper.
00:09:50,00:09:51,That's another way you can tell.
00:09:51,00:09:53,"Oh, it wasn't like he was an early animal rights campaigner"
00:09:53,00:09:54,or anything.
00:09:54,00:09:56,"You know, we shouldn't be using the animals for honest."
00:09:56,00:09:57,Absolutely not.
00:09:57,00:09:57,No.
00:09:57,00:09:58,"Do you guys see that,"
00:09:58,00:10:00,"I think it was only in the last month or so,"
00:10:00,00:10:03,"they sold a lock of Lincoln's hair for $50,000."
00:10:05,00:10:06,Wow.
00:10:06,00:10:10,"Although, there is a thing about fake locks of hair."
00:10:10,00:10:11,"We do know that quite a lot of them exist,"
00:10:11,00:10:13,"because one collector said,"
00:10:13,00:10:16,"""If every lock of Lincoln's hair out there was genuine,"
00:10:16,00:10:17,"the man would have been a wooly mammoth."""
00:10:17,00:10:22,I'm not quite sure what the provenance of this is.
00:10:22,00:10:24,"$50,000."
00:10:24,00:10:25,"Yeah, that's amazing."
00:10:25,00:10:30,I went on eBay to look at what the most expensive items
00:10:30,00:10:33,currently on eBay are that you can buy that are related to Lincoln.
00:10:33,00:10:36,"And hair is a big, big thing."
00:10:36,00:10:39,"So there's strands of hair that you could buy of Lincoln,"
00:10:39,00:10:40,and they're all quite affordable.
00:10:40,00:10:44,I found one for £636 that you could buy.
00:10:44,00:10:45,"I found an exciting,"
00:10:45,00:10:48,"well, the more exciting one is the bundle that I found."
00:10:48,00:10:48,It's for his son.
00:10:48,00:10:50,"It's for his baby son, all right?"
00:10:50,00:10:52,That's not for Dan.
00:10:52,00:10:55,"I'm more interested in this one for $1,500."
00:10:55,00:10:58,"You can get a bundle of Lincoln, Geronimo, Lord Nelson,"
00:10:58,00:11:02,"and King George's hair for $1,500, which is exciting."
00:11:02,00:11:04,And then twice them all together.
00:11:04,00:11:06,"No, they're four separate cards."
00:11:06,00:11:06,"Oh, that's true."
00:11:06,00:11:08,"Yeah, you could have the ultimate wig,"
00:11:08,00:11:09,the ultimate historical wig.
00:11:09,00:11:12,"I don't think this one's real, I have to say."
00:11:12,00:11:14,"The other things that this guy's selling is,"
00:11:14,00:11:16,"you know, Tiger King, Joe Exotic."
00:11:16,00:11:18,He's selling premium condoms of this guy's.
00:11:18,00:11:22,So it's a big premium condoms of this guy's.
00:11:22,00:11:23,Do you mean...
00:11:23,00:11:26,"I know, because I only thought he did the basic condoms."
00:11:26,00:11:29,I'm a bit annoyed that I've been buying
00:11:29,00:11:31,the wrong Joe Exotic condoms now.
00:11:32,00:11:34,"I don't know Tiger King, Joe Exotic,"
00:11:34,00:11:36,but I don't think I need to.
00:11:36,00:11:38,"Oh, OK, it was a bit bigger."
00:11:38,00:11:39,"Imagine the superhero movie,"
00:11:39,00:11:42,where you've got one superhero who keeps tigers
00:11:42,00:11:45,"and another superhero who's a woman who also keeps tigers,"
00:11:45,00:11:47,and they kind of have a grudging respect
00:11:47,00:11:49,"for each other, apart from they don't really."
00:11:49,00:11:51,Then that's pretty much where you are.
00:11:51,00:11:52,"Sounds amazing, thanks."
00:11:52,00:11:52,I'll watch it off.
00:11:52,00:11:53,"Yeah, it's huge."
00:11:53,00:11:55,I'm just on Lincoln Letters.
00:11:55,00:11:58,Did you know that whenever he wrote a letter
00:11:58,00:12:00,that was a bit angry or telling someone off
00:12:00,00:12:01,"or disagreeing with someone,"
00:12:01,00:12:02,"as soon as he'd written it,"
00:12:02,00:12:04,he put it in a locked drawer overnight?
00:12:04,00:12:07,The equivalent of not sending your email
00:12:07,00:12:09,until the next morning.
00:12:09,00:12:10,That's clever.
00:12:10,00:12:10,That's hot.
00:12:10,00:12:11,Yeah.
00:12:11,00:12:11,That's a really good idea.
00:12:11,00:12:12,"Yeah, it's good stuff."
00:12:12,00:12:14,"Yeah, you should do that more often, Andy."
00:12:14,00:12:18,"I stand by everything I said in that letter to you, I know."
00:12:18,00:12:21,"I mean, Andy goes to bed at half-night every night."
00:12:21,00:12:23,It's not like that.
00:12:23,00:12:26,"There's 915 drunken emails from him though, too much."
00:12:30,00:12:33,Did you guys know that Abraham Lincoln's hair
00:12:33,00:12:35,went to the inauguration of Teddy Roosevelt?
00:12:35,00:12:37,I didn't know that.
00:12:37,00:12:42,"Yeah, so he was handed a ring by John Hay,"
00:12:42,00:12:44,who was the Secretary of State for Roosevelt.
00:12:44,00:12:46,But he was also Lincoln's personal secretary
00:12:46,00:12:48,between 1861 and '65.
00:12:48,00:12:51,"He had a strand of Lincoln's hair,"
00:12:51,00:12:52,and he put it into a ring.
00:12:52,00:12:55,And the ring was worn by Teddy Roosevelt
00:12:55,00:12:58,on the day that he was inaugurated in 1905 as president.
00:12:58,00:12:59,"Yeah, so Lincoln was there."
00:12:59,00:13:01,"Did they do that kind of something old,"
00:13:01,00:13:02,"something new, something borrowed, something blue?"
00:13:02,00:13:03,That's right.
00:13:03,00:13:04,The day.
00:13:04,00:13:04,Exactly.
00:13:04,00:13:05,Lincoln related.
00:13:05,00:13:07,"For the next inauguration, it's going to be"
00:13:07,00:13:10,Donald Trump's hair that's going to be worn.
00:13:10,00:13:12,And the something old is the actual president.
00:13:12,00:13:12,Yeah.
00:13:12,00:13:15,Something orange.
00:13:15,00:13:19,"Speaking of Donald Trump, at the time of recording,"
00:13:19,00:13:21,"he still hasn't left the White House,"
00:13:21,00:13:23,and I'm assuming he probably won't have done that.
00:13:23,00:13:25,"We can put this out anytime now, anytime."
00:13:25,00:13:29,Do you know someone else who refused to leave the White House
00:13:29,00:13:31,was Mary Todd Lincoln?
00:13:31,00:13:32,Really?
00:13:32,00:13:32,Yeah.
00:13:32,00:13:34,"So when Abraham Lincoln died,"
00:13:34,00:13:38,"obviously it was, you know, extremely distressing for her."
00:13:38,00:13:39,She was inconsolable.
00:13:39,00:13:41,"She locked herself into the White House,"
00:13:41,00:13:43,and Andrew Johnson couldn't move in.
00:13:43,00:13:46,"And so Andrew Johnson became president on April the 15th,"
00:13:46,00:13:48,"and he couldn't move into the White House until May the 26th,"
00:13:48,00:13:52,because Mary Todd Lincoln just refused to leave.
00:13:52,00:13:55,You can buy her opera glasses.
00:13:55,00:13:56,You can't buy them.
00:13:56,00:13:58,"Actually, no, there isn't one pair."
00:13:58,00:13:59,This is the problem.
00:13:59,00:14:02,"So there is a pair of opera glasses, which ivory,"
00:14:02,00:14:03,and they were engraved.
00:14:03,00:14:06,Mary Lincoln left these glasses in the box at Ford's Theatre
00:14:06,00:14:09,"Good Friday, April 14th, when our president and leader"
00:14:09,00:14:10,was cruelly assassinated.
00:14:10,00:14:14,"They sold for £9,000 last year,"
00:14:14,00:14:17,but there are at least three pairs of Abraham Lincoln's
00:14:17,00:14:18,"opera glasses in circulation,"
00:14:18,00:14:21,which does make you consider just how keen was he
00:14:21,00:14:22,on seeing this play?
00:14:22,00:14:26,"Well, it's so good for the collectors"
00:14:26,00:14:27,"of the weird paraphernalia,"
00:14:27,00:14:29,"which is a lot of it is around the assassination, isn't it?"
00:14:29,00:14:31,People collecting stuff that was at the theatre.
00:14:31,00:14:34,And it's great for them that Abraham Lincoln seemed to stuff
00:14:34,00:14:35,his pockets with stuff.
00:14:35,00:14:39,There's a collection.
00:14:39,00:14:42,"I think it's in the Library of Congress,"
00:14:42,00:14:44,and it's the contents of Abraham Lincoln's pockets
00:14:44,00:14:45,on the night of the assassination.
00:14:45,00:14:46,It's just full.
00:14:46,00:14:48,"I don't know how big pockets were in those days,"
00:14:48,00:14:52,"but that was two pairs of glasses, I guess."
00:14:52,00:14:54,You lose one while you're sitting there watching the opera.
00:14:54,00:14:55,You've got a second.
00:14:55,00:14:57,"One of them was mended with string, I guess,"
00:14:57,00:14:59,"because he's such a humble guy,"
00:14:59,00:15:01,"such a kind of Jeremy Corbyn-style leader,"
00:15:01,00:15:02,having glasses taped together.
00:15:02,00:15:04,"Well, like Jack Duckworth, I think."
00:15:04,00:15:06,Jack Duckworth.
00:15:06,00:15:08,"Sorry, that's a coronation."
00:15:08,00:15:09,It's a superhero.
00:15:09,00:15:09,It's a superhero.
00:15:09,00:15:10,It's a superhero.
00:15:10,00:15:14,He becomes Duck Man at times of great stress.
00:15:14,00:15:18,"He was carrying a pocket knife,"
00:15:18,00:15:19,"which I think is so painful,"
00:15:19,00:15:21,because he could have whipped that out and defended himself
00:15:21,00:15:22,had he not been shot in the back of that.
00:15:22,00:15:24,He would have literally been bringing a knife
00:15:24,00:15:25,"to a gunfight, hadn't he?"
00:15:25,00:15:27,[laughter]
00:15:27,00:15:34,"OK, it is time for fact number two,"
00:15:34,00:15:35,and that is James.
00:15:35,00:15:39,"OK, my fact this week is that if you ask someone what day it is,"
00:15:39,00:15:42,they'll take twice as long to answer on a Wednesday
00:15:42,00:15:44,as they would on a Monday or Friday.
00:15:44,00:15:48,"And that's because by Wednesday,"
00:15:48,00:15:50,you literally have no idea what day it is.
00:15:50,00:15:53,Does this data take into account everyone working at home
00:15:53,00:15:56,and having no idea at all?
00:15:56,00:15:57,We might come to that later.
00:15:57,00:15:58,"Oh, OK."
00:15:58,00:16:02,But let me quickly explain this study very quickly.
00:16:02,00:16:05,"So this is a 2015 study by David A. Ellis,"
00:16:05,00:16:06,"Richard Wiseman, and Rob Jenkins."
00:16:06,00:16:10,And they asked people what day is it?
00:16:10,00:16:11,That's the first thing that they asked.
00:16:11,00:16:14,And they timed how long it took people to respond.
00:16:14,00:16:16,And most of the differences
00:16:16,00:16:18,"were not really significant statistically,"
00:16:18,00:16:20,but they did find the statistical difference
00:16:20,00:16:22,"between Monday and Wednesday,"
00:16:22,00:16:25,"which was it took just over half a second for people to say,"
00:16:25,00:16:27,"well, it's Monday, obviously."
00:16:27,00:16:31,"And it took about a second and a half just under for people to go,"
00:16:31,00:16:34,it's Wednesday.
00:16:34,00:16:36,And the same was between Wednesday and Friday.
00:16:36,00:16:38,But none of the other comparisons were kind of significant.
00:16:38,00:16:43,And they reckon that it's because Monday is a really depressing day
00:16:43,00:16:44,because the week starts in.
00:16:44,00:16:47,Friday is the exciting day because it's the new Monday.
00:16:47,00:16:50,"And then in the middle, they all kind of come together."
00:16:50,00:16:52,And that's what they think.
00:16:52,00:16:54,Friday is really exciting
00:16:54,00:16:56,because I get to go to bed at 10 o'clock on Friday.
00:16:56,00:17:02,"James, when they did the survey, when they were asking people,"
00:17:02,00:17:04,did they kind of dress up the actual survey
00:17:04,00:17:07,as just a bit of form filling in before the experiment began?
00:17:07,00:17:08,"So they said, all right, let's just get you logged in."
00:17:08,00:17:09,So what day is it?
00:17:09,00:17:10,And then timed them.
00:17:10,00:17:11,You're smashing it.
00:17:11,00:17:13,You would be at scientists.
00:17:13,00:17:14,"Yeah, that's what they did."
00:17:14,00:17:16,They didn't tell people what the study was about.
00:17:16,00:17:20,"And they said, OK, first of all, what day do you think it is?"
00:17:20,00:17:21,That's so funny.
00:17:21,00:17:23,But then did they ask them to leave straight away?
00:17:23,00:17:25,Because you'd really think you'd absolutely failed that initial question.
00:17:25,00:17:26,"Yes, out."
00:17:26,00:17:27,"OK, you can go."
00:17:27,00:17:29,"The whole rest of the day, you'd be going,"
00:17:29,00:17:30,"fuck, is it Thursday?"
00:17:30,00:17:31,That's a Tuesday?
00:17:31,00:17:34,"But you'd kind of know it, though,"
00:17:34,00:17:36,"because if you had to go in for a survey,"
00:17:36,00:17:39,"I'd be in the preceding week going, oh, god, I remember,"
00:17:39,00:17:40,I've got that survey on Wednesday.
00:17:40,00:17:42,What are you doing on Wednesday?
00:17:42,00:17:44,I've got to go and do the survey.
00:17:44,00:17:45,That would be at the forefront of my mind.
00:17:45,00:17:46,That's a really good point.
00:17:46,00:17:48,"I'm not sure in the study, if they thought about that,"
00:17:48,00:17:52,were actually the fact that they're doing the study affects the result.
00:17:52,00:17:54,I suppose it does in a way like you say.
00:17:54,00:17:54,Yeah.
00:17:54,00:17:56,So the difference might be even greater.
00:17:56,00:17:56,The difference.
00:17:56,00:17:57,Would have thought.
00:17:57,00:17:59,"Yeah, could be, could be."
00:17:59,00:18:02,"But during lockdown, there was a study done in America."
00:18:02,00:18:04,This was by the Southwest News Service.
00:18:04,00:18:06,And they asked people what day it was.
00:18:06,00:18:10,And 59% of people said they were unsure what day it was.
00:18:10,00:18:10,And that was the show.
00:18:10,00:18:11,Wow.
00:18:11,00:18:13,Most people didn't know what month it was this year.
00:18:13,00:18:17,I'm not sure how scientific that one was.
00:18:17,00:18:20,And there was another study with a different set of people
00:18:20,00:18:21,which says what days it feel like.
00:18:21,00:18:26,And they found that usually people kind of got it right.
00:18:26,00:18:30,But mismatches were 52.2% during a bank holiday.
00:18:30,00:18:34,So more than half of people in a bank holiday week
00:18:34,00:18:35,will not be quite sure.
00:18:35,00:18:37,Or will think it feels like a different day
00:18:37,00:18:38,than it actually feels like.
00:18:38,00:18:39,Which I think is right.
00:18:39,00:18:40,"I agree with that, Steve."
00:18:40,00:18:41,"I definitely have that, yeah."
00:18:41,00:18:42,Yeah.
00:18:42,00:18:42,Yeah.
00:18:42,00:18:46,"People, it's because, and they've theorised that it's because"
00:18:46,00:18:47,certain days have stronger.
00:18:47,00:18:48,Identities than others.
00:18:48,00:18:49,Don't know as well.
00:18:49,00:18:50,"They said, which is really sad for some of the real"
00:18:50,00:18:53,personality list days in the middle of the week.
00:18:53,00:18:55,"But I think in the follow up study,"
00:18:55,00:18:57,which was also David Ellis and Co.
00:18:57,00:18:59,They asked people for the words they associate most
00:18:59,00:19:00,with certain days.
00:19:00,00:19:01,It's very predictable.
00:19:01,00:19:05,"It's Monday is words like boredom, tiredness, and rubbish."
00:19:05,00:19:08,"Friday is fun, friends, party, and bacon, apparently."
00:19:08,00:19:10,One of them is pop words.
00:19:10,00:19:13,"I mean, is there a big tradition of bacon Fridays?"
00:19:13,00:19:14,I don't know about.
00:19:14,00:19:14,I think there is.
00:19:14,00:19:18,"I was going to say in my family, because I grew up in a"
00:19:18,00:19:20,"Catholic family, we weren't allowed to meet or we weren't"
00:19:20,00:19:21,supposed to have meat on Fridays.
00:19:21,00:19:24,"I mean, maybe that's why you're thinking about it so much"
00:19:24,00:19:24,though.
00:19:24,00:19:28,"Yes, I could really do with a bacon Saturday."
00:19:28,00:19:32,"Yeah, I think maybe I definitely, this is anecdote now,"
00:19:32,00:19:36,"not data, but I definitely would allow myself to have a"
00:19:36,00:19:41,"bacon sandwich on a Friday, which is a bit really less"
00:19:41,00:19:45,healthy than obviously the grains and vegetables I
00:19:45,00:19:46,normally consume.
00:19:46,00:19:48,Such a scar.
00:19:48,00:19:51,"Insight into your unbelievably weird mind, Andy."
00:19:51,00:19:51,Friday.
00:19:51,00:19:53,"Friday is a huge day for you, isn't it, Andy?"
00:19:53,00:19:56,"Bacon sandwich in the morning, 10 p.m. bed time."
00:19:56,00:19:58,"My God, you're off the chain."
00:19:58,00:20:01,"You probably got to bed early on a Thursday thinking,"
00:20:01,00:20:03,"well, I'm really looking forward to getting up for next"
00:20:03,00:20:05,morning like kids on Christmas Eve.
00:20:05,00:20:08,"I want to maximise the Friday awakeness, yeah."
00:20:09,00:20:11,"Actually, this is a thing where people are more concerned"
00:20:11,00:20:14,with their health on a Monday than any other day of the week.
00:20:14,00:20:18,"So just if you look at Google searches, people search for"
00:20:18,00:20:21,"health-related things, you know, how to stop smoking or"
00:20:21,00:20:24,starting a diet or making a doctor's appointment.
00:20:24,00:20:27,They do that 80% more on a Monday than on a Saturday.
00:20:27,00:20:32,No one on a Saturday is searching how to give up smoking.
00:20:32,00:20:35,We've all got our bacon hangover that we're trying to get out of.
00:20:37,00:20:40,There are certain countries and cultures that make it a lot
00:20:40,00:20:42,easier for you to remember what day it is.
00:20:42,00:20:46,"So in Thailand, they used to do a thing where they would dress"
00:20:46,00:20:47,in the colour of the day.
00:20:47,00:20:50,So every day is assigned a colour.
00:20:50,00:20:53,"Sunday red, Monday yellow, Tuesday pink, Wednesday green,"
00:20:53,00:20:56,"Thursday orange, Friday blue, Saturday purple."
00:20:56,00:21:00,And those colours were all to do with Hindu astrological
00:21:00,00:21:03,influences and the colour was given to each one of them.
00:21:03,00:21:05,So you would go out of your house and you would wear
00:21:05,00:21:07,if it was a Monday yellow.
00:21:07,00:21:09,Everyone would be wearing yellow on a Monday.
00:21:09,00:21:11,"This is, yeah, this is a while ago."
00:21:11,00:21:14,"So, and it might be that you would have a statement piece"
00:21:14,00:21:16,on you that was yellow just to represent it.
00:21:16,00:21:20,"And nowadays, because everyone knows their own colour"
00:21:20,00:21:22,"because they're born on one of those days,"
00:21:22,00:21:24,"they have a personal colour, that becomes their colour."
00:21:24,00:21:27,"So more often than not, you'll see that as a prominent colour"
00:21:27,00:21:28,on someone in Thailand.
00:21:28,00:21:31,"And you can go, oh, you were born on a Wednesday or so on."
00:21:31,00:21:32,That's amazing.
00:21:32,00:21:34,"But then if it's a bank holiday, do you turn up on the"
00:21:34,00:21:37,green day wearing something blue and everyone's like...
00:21:37,00:21:39,"Oh, it's so embarrassing."
00:21:39,00:21:41,"It's like turning up to non-uniform day,"
00:21:41,00:21:44,"forgetting that it's happened and wearing a uniform, isn't it?"
00:21:44,00:21:46,"Oh, God, it's the stuff of nightmares."
00:21:46,00:21:48,I know what our colours are for all four of us here.
00:21:48,00:21:49,"Oh, yeah."
00:21:49,00:21:51,Of what day we were born on.
00:21:51,00:21:54,"So, Anna, you're blue."
00:21:54,00:21:55,You were born on a Friday.
00:21:55,00:21:56,Who was I now?
00:21:56,00:21:59,"Yeah, James, you were blue."
00:21:59,00:22:00,You were born on a Friday.
00:22:00,00:22:02,"Hey, we're blue twins."
00:22:02,00:22:03,Yeah.
00:22:03,00:22:04,And I am a blue.
00:22:04,00:22:06,"Hey, we're blue triplets."
00:22:06,00:22:07,Nice one.
00:22:07,00:22:10,"This is so nice and cosy, and we're all friends."
00:22:10,00:22:12,And we're all the same colour.
00:22:12,00:22:13,We're all meant to be.
00:22:13,00:22:14,It's like we've been chosen by the university.
00:22:14,00:22:16,What day was I born?
00:22:16,00:22:16,Then?
00:22:16,00:22:17,You're purple.
00:22:17,00:22:18,You're a Saturday.
00:22:18,00:22:21,You're the ticky week you have to go.
00:22:21,00:22:26,But we are now auditioning for someone to join the podcast
00:22:26,00:22:27,who was born on a Friday.
00:22:27,00:22:28,"So if that's you, get in touch."
00:22:28,00:22:32,Do you know someone whose middle name is Friday?
00:22:33,00:22:34,Ooh.
00:22:34,00:22:35,Is it someone really famous?
00:22:35,00:22:35,I think that.
00:22:35,00:22:36,"No, I do. I do."
00:22:36,00:22:39,"But only because of research, but let's pretend I don't."
00:22:39,00:22:40,"Yeah, yeah."
00:22:40,00:22:42,"It's someone, it's a fictional character."
00:22:42,00:22:46,"It's not, I know the horse in that riddle's first name is Friday."
00:22:46,00:22:48,"That's different, isn't it?"
00:22:48,00:22:49,He rode in on a Friday.
00:22:49,00:22:49,Yeah.
00:22:49,00:22:52,"It's not Man Friday, is it?"
00:22:52,00:22:53,Man Friday.
00:22:53,00:22:55,"So he'd be called Friday, Friday."
00:22:55,00:22:56,Friday was his middle name.
00:22:56,00:23:01,But it's someone whose first name is a day of the week.
00:23:01,00:23:02,So...
00:23:02,00:23:03,Wednesday Adams.
00:23:03,00:23:04,Wednesday Adams.
00:23:04,00:23:06,So her middle name is Friday.
00:23:06,00:23:08,"And the reason that she's called Wednesday,"
00:23:08,00:23:10,"I mean, I know Dan knows."
00:23:10,00:23:11,Anyone know why she's called Wednesday?
00:23:11,00:23:14,"It's because Wednesday's child is full of woe,"
00:23:14,00:23:17,according to that rhyme.
00:23:17,00:23:20,And so she was like the sad child.
00:23:20,00:23:21,She was miserable.
00:23:21,00:23:21,Yeah.
00:23:21,00:23:26,"In Ghana, you are named after the day of the week you're born on."
00:23:28,00:23:34,"So boys are named Kwadwo, Komla, Kwaku, Yor, Kofi, Kwami, Kwazi"
00:23:34,00:23:35,after the days of the week.
00:23:35,00:23:37,"And girls, they're a female equivalent of two,"
00:23:37,00:23:42,"Adzoa, Abena, Aqwa, Ya, Fue, Amma and Aqosua."
00:23:42,00:23:45,And you get that name when you're born.
00:23:45,00:23:46,"And then you get another name a bit later on,"
00:23:46,00:23:49,but you keep your day name and it becomes your middle name.
00:23:49,00:23:52,So you can tell from a birth certificate in Ghana what day it's born.
00:23:52,00:23:52,Did you say Kofi?
00:23:52,00:23:54,Is Kofi anan one of those?
00:23:54,00:23:55,Maske.
00:23:55,00:23:56,"Yeah, I guess Kofi is."
00:23:56,00:23:57,Kofi is one of the names.
00:23:57,00:23:59,That's the fifth of the list.
00:23:59,00:24:00,Yeah.
00:24:00,00:24:03,"You just said, Andy, that you could know from a birth certificate"
00:24:03,00:24:04,what day the person was born.
00:24:04,00:24:05,I hope I'm not saying it down.
00:24:05,00:24:11,"I was hoping we, I was hoping I'd slit that one past you."
00:24:11,00:24:13,"Typical, typical purple comment."
00:24:13,00:24:23,"I looked a bit into Wednesday specifically,"
00:24:23,00:24:25,because it's this underappreciated today.
00:24:25,00:24:30,And I like the sort of stuff about the word Wednesday.
00:24:30,00:24:32,It's basically the wrong word.
00:24:32,00:24:34,So I've decided we should rename Wednesday.
00:24:34,00:24:36,"It's named after Odin, who was called Woden,"
00:24:36,00:24:39,who is the early Norse god.
00:24:39,00:24:44,"And it was named that because it was thought to be a parallel to Mercury,"
00:24:44,00:24:47,"which is what so, Mercury and all those Romance languages,"
00:24:47,00:24:49,"Wednesday is named after Mercury, the god."
00:24:49,00:24:54,But I've recently been listening to the excellent audio book on Norse gods
00:24:54,00:24:55,by Neil Gaiman.
00:24:55,00:24:59,And Odin is nothing like Mercury.
00:24:59,00:25:04,"So Mercury is like a fun loving trickster, playful, wily."
00:25:04,00:25:06,Odin's not like that.
00:25:06,00:25:07,I think it should be Loki.
00:25:07,00:25:09,"So I'm going to start calling Wednesday Loki,"
00:25:09,00:25:11,and everyone's going to get confused.
00:25:11,00:25:15,"But the person who decided that it should be the equivalent,"
00:25:15,00:25:16,"it should be Odin, was Tacitus."
00:25:16,00:25:18,And this is in the first century.
00:25:18,00:25:22,"And it was when the Romans were kind of occupying bits of Germania,"
00:25:22,00:25:23,as it was called at the time.
00:25:23,00:25:25,And he decided Odin was the equivalent.
00:25:25,00:25:28,"And it was because, and I just love this word,"
00:25:28,00:25:31,"they're both psychopomps, Odin and Mercury."
00:25:31,00:25:34,"And a psychopomp, again a word I'm going to use a lot now,"
00:25:34,00:25:39,is the word for a deity who escorts people from Earth to the afterlife when they die.
00:25:39,00:25:40,Wow.
00:25:40,00:25:41,So that's a psychopomp.
00:25:41,00:25:43,That's a great word.
00:25:43,00:25:47,"I thought that, let's say we're going to accept that it's Odin's day,"
00:25:47,00:25:49,rather than Loki's day.
00:25:49,00:25:52,"Let's just imagine that that's fine, which we all know now it isn't."
00:25:53,00:25:55,"From this moment, we are all calling it Loki's day."
00:25:55,00:25:57,But let's imagine it was Odin's day.
00:25:57,00:26:00,Why is it not Odin's day?
00:26:00,00:26:01,Why is it Odin's day?
00:26:01,00:26:06,"Like, it's because it was another name that was used in Germanic areas for Odin."
00:26:06,00:26:09,"But Odin had more than 150 different names,"
00:26:09,00:26:13,any one of which we could have chosen for Wednesday instead of Odin.
00:26:13,00:26:16,"So we could have had Grim's day, a Grim day."
00:26:16,00:26:20,"Like for Wednesday, we could have had Skillfinger day."
00:26:22,00:26:22,That would have been good.
00:26:22,00:26:26,"We could have had Sada, Sada day."
00:26:26,00:26:28,"But I guess that was a bit too close to Saturday,"
00:26:28,00:26:29,so I decided not to go for it.
00:26:29,00:26:30,That's great.
00:26:30,00:26:31,But yeah.
00:26:31,00:26:33,That's Skillfinger day.
00:26:33,00:26:33,I take it back.
00:26:33,00:26:34,It shouldn't be Loki's day.
00:26:34,00:26:36,Let's call it Skillfinger day.
00:26:36,00:26:36,Skillfinger day.
00:26:36,00:26:38,I love that.
00:26:38,00:26:40,That's so good.
00:26:40,00:26:42,"Hey, what's your favourite day of the week, guys?"
00:26:42,00:26:44,It's obviously Friday.
00:26:44,00:26:45,Thursday.
00:26:45,00:26:46,"Oh, Dan, you nerd."
00:26:46,00:26:48,Is it Thursday because we record the podcast on a Thursday?
00:26:48,00:26:50,This is the highlight of your week.
00:26:50,00:26:52,That's the best moment of my whole life.
00:26:52,00:26:55,"No, I like the number four."
00:26:55,00:26:56,Four is my favourite number.
00:26:56,00:27:00,And so that's the fourth day of the week to my week schedule.
00:27:00,00:27:02,"I know Sunday is technically the first day,"
00:27:02,00:27:03,so it should be Wednesday.
00:27:03,00:27:03,James.
00:27:03,00:27:04,Yeah.
00:27:04,00:27:07,"I think Monday is the first day officially,"
00:27:07,00:27:09,according to the International Standards Organization.
00:27:09,00:27:12,So I think you're fine with having Thursday.
00:27:12,00:27:14,"In Russian, Thursday is Chepyorka,"
00:27:14,00:27:15,which means like fourth day.
00:27:15,00:27:17,So it works there as well.
00:27:17,00:27:19,"My favourite, I think, probably Saturday,"
00:27:19,00:27:21,where I can just chill out and watch the football.
00:27:21,00:27:24,"OK, everyone's got good answers here,"
00:27:24,00:27:27,"apart from Dan, whose answer is very weird, statistically."
00:27:27,00:27:33,So 21% of young people say that Friday is their favourite day.
00:27:33,00:27:35,Only 6% of young people like Sundays.
00:27:35,00:27:37,And I think that rises as you get older.
00:27:37,00:27:39,You start to appreciate Sunday a bit more.
00:27:39,00:27:40,You're off the bacon binges.
00:27:40,00:27:45,But Tuesday is just 1% of people's favourite day.
00:27:45,00:27:47,And I think Thursday might be another 1%.
00:27:48,00:27:49,It scores very low.
00:27:49,00:27:51,Do you know why no one likes Tuesday?
00:27:51,00:27:54,Because we were saying that Wednesday was named after Odin.
00:27:54,00:27:56,"And Odin was a pretty cool god, right?"
00:27:56,00:27:58,He was the king of the gods and stuff.
00:27:58,00:27:59,Do you know who Tuesday was named after?
00:27:59,00:28:00,No.
00:28:00,00:28:04,"Tuesday was named after a god called Tia,"
00:28:04,00:28:07,who is one of the most obscure gods.
00:28:07,00:28:10,We have literally no idea anything about this guy.
00:28:10,00:28:15,We only have one myth of him that's left.
00:28:15,00:28:16,We don't really know anything about him at all.
00:28:16,00:28:19,"And there was a wolf, who was a baby wolf,"
00:28:19,00:28:21,"but it was growing really, really quickly."
00:28:21,00:28:24,"And the gods were worried that this wolf was going to get so big,"
00:28:24,00:28:25,he was going to eat them all.
00:28:25,00:28:28,"And so they said, right, we're going to have to tie him down."
00:28:28,00:28:30,"So we're going to tie him in a load of ropes and stuff,"
00:28:30,00:28:32,and like magic god chains.
00:28:32,00:28:36,"But when Fenrir the wolf saw the chains,"
00:28:36,00:28:38,he didn't trust that anything was going to happen.
00:28:38,00:28:42,"So he said, OK, well, I'll kind of come and say hi."
00:28:42,00:28:45,"But only if one of you puts your arm down my throat,"
00:28:46,00:28:49,because then I'll trust that you're not going to chain me up.
00:28:49,00:28:54,"And so Tia, the god, who Tuesday's named after,"
00:28:54,00:28:56,"decided, OK, well, in good faith,"
00:28:56,00:28:59,I'll be the one who puts my arm down your throat.
00:28:59,00:29:01,"And then, of course, they chain the wolf up"
00:29:01,00:29:02,and the wolf bit his arm off.
00:29:02,00:29:07,That's the only story we have about the guy who Tuesday's named after.
00:29:07,00:29:11,It's such an important moral to that story.
00:29:11,00:29:12,Don't put your arm down a wolf's throat.
00:29:12,00:29:14,That is an important lesson.
00:29:14,00:29:16,"Yeah, that's true."
00:29:16,00:29:17,Yes.
00:29:17,00:29:19,"Without that, wolf arm casualties"
00:29:19,00:29:20,would be way higher than they are.
00:29:20,00:29:23,"I've got one last thing before we move on,"
00:29:23,00:29:27,"which is, remember, we were talking about that one dickhead"
00:29:27,00:29:33,who gets the colour on as they rock up to a sort of school in Thailand?
00:29:33,00:29:35,I'm afraid I'm that dickhead.
00:29:35,00:29:36,What?
00:29:36,00:29:38,"Because I was born on a Saturday, it turns out."
00:29:38,00:29:42,Where are you? So what colour are you?
00:29:42,00:29:43,I'm purple. I'm with Andy.
00:29:43,00:29:44,"Welcome, Ben."
00:29:44,00:29:45,You traitor.
00:29:45,00:29:46,I can't believe it.
00:29:46,00:29:48,Have you just been doubled?
00:29:48,00:29:49,"Did you have a feeling, as you said that?"
00:29:49,00:29:51,"I bet I've got that wrong, as well, since I've done anything wrong."
00:29:51,00:29:54,"Oh, we just tried to get in Mayan and Anna's cool club"
00:29:54,00:29:56,by pretending to be a blue.
00:29:56,00:29:58,"I was trying to be a blue, yeah."
00:29:58,00:30:01,"Yeah. No, I had a weird feeling come over me."
00:30:01,00:30:02,"I thought, ""I don't feel very blue."""
00:30:02,00:30:06,"I had a quick Google, it turns out."
00:30:06,00:30:10,"I mean, it's so in line with my facts."
00:30:13,00:30:17,Is this a situation where your whole life you thought you were born on a Friday
00:30:17,00:30:18,and you've only just realised?
00:30:18,00:30:20,"Or was it a fact that you thought,"
00:30:20,00:30:21,"""I know what day I was born, I'm going to Google it,"""
00:30:21,00:30:23,and you just got the wrong answer on Google?
00:30:23,00:30:23,"Oh, which one?"
00:30:23,00:30:25,"I got the wrong answer on Google, yeah."
00:30:25,00:30:26,"I double checked it on a different site,"
00:30:26,00:30:28,"just as we were talking, because it just felt wrong."
00:30:28,00:30:31,"And I had a memory, just a memory of Saturday."
00:30:31,00:30:35,I remember seeing the newspaper as I came out.
00:30:41,00:30:45,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Anna."
00:30:45,00:30:49,"My fact this week is that according to Vietnamese historians,"
00:30:49,00:30:53,Chinese forces were once defeated by a woman who had breast so long
00:30:53,00:30:56,she had to throw them over her shoulders in battle.
00:30:56,00:31:02,"And this is, I think this is the second part we've had on the podcast about"
00:31:02,00:31:04,women with breast so long they had to throw them over their shoulders.
00:31:04,00:31:06,One was a yeti.
00:31:06,00:31:07,"Yeah, one's a yeti."
00:31:07,00:31:08,Female yeti.
00:31:08,00:31:11,They have to throw them over their shoulders before they chase you
00:31:11,00:31:13,or they might trip on them and throw it themselves.
00:31:13,00:31:14,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:31:14,00:31:15,Possibly.
00:31:15,00:31:18,"Can I ask, is this lady as real as a yeti?"
00:31:18,00:31:21,I would say she's more real than a yeti.
00:31:21,00:31:24,So I'm going to say this fact is less of a nonsense fact than Dan's
00:31:24,00:31:27,"because it's recorded by historians,"
00:31:27,00:31:30,and it's about almost certainly historical figure.
00:31:30,00:31:33,"But I still find it hard to believe that this breast thing actually happened,"
00:31:33,00:31:38,"but this, so this is this warrior called Lady Chu, or Lady Trieu,"
00:31:38,00:31:39,as we'd anglicise it.
00:31:39,00:31:41,And she is amazing.
00:31:41,00:31:42,And she's a hero in Vietnam.
00:31:42,00:31:48,"In the third century, she led this revolt against the invading Chinese Wu state."
00:31:48,00:31:53,And the writing about her from almost contemporary said that she was this
00:31:53,00:31:57,"extraordinary figure and her features included four foot long breasts,"
00:31:57,00:32:00,"which either she tossed over her shoulders to get them out the way,"
00:32:00,00:32:03,or sometimes she tied them to her torso so they didn't get out the way of her.
00:32:03,00:32:07,It's interesting because I read in one account that they said that she had
00:32:07,00:32:09,three breasts that were four feet long.
00:32:09,00:32:10,Yes.
00:32:10,00:32:13,"So I can imagine how two of them can be throttled over the shoulder,"
00:32:13,00:32:14,"but the other one's going to hit you in the face, isn't it?"
00:32:14,00:32:16,When you... It is.
00:32:16,00:32:16,Yeah.
00:32:16,00:32:18,Maybe that's the one she strapped her stomach.
00:32:18,00:32:18,Maybe.
00:32:18,00:32:20,"Because, yeah, I've seen a painting of her with the third,"
00:32:20,00:32:22,sneaky third breast hanging down there.
00:32:22,00:32:24,"OK, so we're not disputing the length of the boobs."
00:32:24,00:32:26,"We've actually just cracked that she had three,"
00:32:26,00:32:30,and both of these points about going over the shoulders and around the stomach are true.
00:32:30,00:32:30,"Well, also..."
00:32:30,00:32:31,That's exciting.
00:32:31,00:32:33,Nine feet tall was the other thing as well.
00:32:33,00:32:35,"So I think, you know..."
00:32:35,00:32:39,"Yeah, this is a sort of tradition in Vietnam where some"
00:32:39,00:32:41,"historic warriors take on this mythical status,"
00:32:41,00:32:45,and then they are written up as becoming more and more godlike.
00:32:45,00:32:47,"So, yeah, she was written up as being nine feet tall."
00:32:47,00:32:49,"She could walk over 1,000 miles in a day."
00:32:49,00:32:52,"But there are various things we think she probably did do,"
00:32:52,00:32:54,like rode elephants into battle.
00:32:54,00:32:57,So rode on an elephant's head.
00:32:57,00:32:59,The stories say she fought with a sword in each hand.
00:32:59,00:33:02,"Again, probably why she had to tie down her breasts,"
00:33:02,00:33:04,"because otherwise you're in danger of slicing one off, aren't you?"
00:33:04,00:33:04,"Oh, yeah."
00:33:04,00:33:05,Mmm.
00:33:05,00:33:08,She had a voice as loud as a temple bell.
00:33:08,00:33:11,"So, but I think she probably did exist,"
00:33:11,00:33:14,"although oddly, she's not mentioned in Chinese sources,"
00:33:14,00:33:16,whereas she's mentioned a lot in Vietnamese sources.
00:33:16,00:33:19,"But I think for China, this was just a..."
00:33:19,00:33:22,"You don't really want to write about these people who defeated you a lot,"
00:33:22,00:33:25,especially if it's this woman with extraordinary breasts.
00:33:25,00:33:29,"Whereas in Vietnam, it was much more of a great thing to record."
00:33:29,00:33:32,Although there is one thing that a lot of the women got written out of history
00:33:32,00:33:33,"in China, didn't they?"
00:33:33,00:33:37,"When Neo-Confucianism came in,"
00:33:37,00:33:39,they kind of changed the rules a little bit.
00:33:39,00:33:41,So women had to be at home
00:33:41,00:33:44,and had to have this exact role in society.
00:33:44,00:33:46,And so a lot of the historians in China
00:33:46,00:33:49,"wrote out all of the women in history, I think,"
00:33:49,00:33:51,the man that was 10th century or something.
00:33:51,00:33:52,"It was, I think it was before that."
00:33:52,00:33:55,"And Vietnamese society used to be much more equal,"
00:33:55,00:33:57,"in fact, impressively equal,"
00:33:57,00:33:59,"until it was sort of from the 1st century,"
00:33:59,00:34:01,Chinese started really encroaching.
00:34:01,00:34:02,"And like you say, it was Confucianism."
00:34:02,00:34:05,They really liked nuclear families.
00:34:05,00:34:06,"It was just all the same old stories, isn't it?"
00:34:06,00:34:09,"Nuclear families, women subservient to men."
00:34:09,00:34:12,Whereas Vietnamese society was much more clown-based.
00:34:12,00:34:13,It was quite matriarchal.
00:34:13,00:34:17,Some people say that it was actually more women-led than man-led.
00:34:17,00:34:22,And so it wasn't totally unusual for the idea of female warriors and female fighters.
00:34:22,00:34:24,So she was eventually defeated.
00:34:24,00:34:26,"And there's a kind of myth about how she was defeated,"
00:34:26,00:34:28,which is really nice.
00:34:28,00:34:30,"Well, it's maybe a slightly sexist myth, actually."
00:34:30,00:34:32,"The myth is that she was very fastidious,"
00:34:32,00:34:34,and that the Chinese general who defeated her
00:34:34,00:34:37,"sent his men out of the fortress naked,"
00:34:37,00:34:38,kicking up all the dirt and grime.
00:34:38,00:34:42,And she was so horrified by this that she left the battlefield.
00:34:42,00:34:43,"And then her men all panicked,"
00:34:43,00:34:46,because obviously the nine-foot warrior general has run away.
00:34:46,00:34:48,And that's why they were defeated.
00:34:48,00:34:51,But it feels slightly like she can't cope with a bit of grime.
00:34:51,00:34:54,"Yeah, as the man's willies."
00:34:54,00:34:56,"Yeah, that was Chinese historians who said"
00:34:56,00:34:59,the men exposed their genitals and scared her off.
00:34:59,00:35:03,"Which, interestingly, was also claimed of the Trung sisters,"
00:35:03,00:35:05,who were some other Vietnamese warriors.
00:35:05,00:35:07,And it was said they were defeated when men showed them their balls.
00:35:07,00:35:13,"Well, there was this idea that you could scare these people away with penises, wasn't there?"
00:35:13,00:35:17,Because there is the really funny story of the Chinese commander
00:35:17,00:35:21,"who, after Lady Trieu died, started having nightmares"
00:35:21,00:35:25,where she came to him in his dreams and was saying that she was going to kill him.
00:35:25,00:35:31,"And so to keep her away, he hung a hundred wooden penises outside his house"
00:35:31,00:35:33,so that she wouldn't come to him in his dreams.
00:35:33,00:35:39,"I mean, that takes a lot of explaining away, doesn't it,"
00:35:39,00:35:41,when your relatives come round to visit.
00:35:41,00:35:44,Whenever a hundred wooden penises outside your house.
00:35:44,00:35:48,"Well, I just saw it in Homes and Gardens last week."
00:35:48,00:35:53,"They had a special offer on which, if you buy one, you get 99 free."
00:35:55,00:35:59,"Well, what about the Trung sisters then, Anna, who you just mentioned?"
00:35:59,00:36:01,"Oh, yeah, they're cracking as well."
00:36:01,00:36:03,"Again, these are real Vietnamese heroes, aren't they?"
00:36:03,00:36:04,Worshiped in Vietnam.
00:36:04,00:36:08,"So this was the first century, a couple of hundred years before Chu."
00:36:08,00:36:11,And they were Trung Trac and Trung Nhi.
00:36:11,00:36:14,And they defeated an invading Chinese army.
00:36:14,00:36:18,And they actually conquered 65 cities in the end.
00:36:18,00:36:20,And this is about AD 40.
00:36:20,00:36:22,And Trung Trac became queen.
00:36:22,00:36:24,And apparently she was a lovely queen.
00:36:24,00:36:26,She had quite a soft rule.
00:36:26,00:36:29,She tried to restore a lot of Vietnamese practices.
00:36:29,00:36:31,"And yeah, they're amazing."
00:36:31,00:36:34,"And the idea is that they were raised by their mother,"
00:36:34,00:36:36,who taught them just like you teach men.
00:36:36,00:36:40,"And so taught them how to fight, taught them lots of military skills."
00:36:40,00:36:41,Yeah.
00:36:41,00:36:44,"And these 65 cities that they conquered,"
00:36:44,00:36:49,"the head of each city became like the head of one of their armies,"
00:36:49,00:36:51,"almost, or one of their groups, all women."
00:36:51,00:36:54,So they had 65 female generals who would fight
00:36:54,00:36:56,in the wars against the Chinese.
00:36:56,00:36:58,"One of which was the mum, right?"
00:36:58,00:36:59,"Yes, exactly."
00:36:59,00:36:59,"Oh, really?"
00:36:59,00:37:02,"Oh, they're like the Kardashians in that sense."
00:37:02,00:37:06,The momager figure is still very important to them.
00:37:06,00:37:06,Very much like that.
00:37:06,00:37:08,"But just exactly like that, yeah."
00:37:08,00:37:11,They once killed a tiger so that they could write
00:37:11,00:37:13,a promise to the people of Vietnam on its skin.
00:37:13,00:37:16,"If you've run out of paper, sometimes it's all you can do."
00:37:19,00:37:21,"I think Khloe Kardashian did that once, actually."
00:37:21,00:37:27,"And these Trang sisters were descendants of Lạc Long Quân,"
00:37:27,00:37:33,"who was the original dragon lord, who is, according to the creation myth of Vietnam,"
00:37:33,00:37:35,he was the founder of the Vietnamese people.
00:37:35,00:37:40,"He married an immortal fairy called Au Cô, and they got married."
00:37:40,00:37:46,And she laid 100 eggs who gave birth to the 100 noble families of Vietnam.
00:37:46,00:37:50,And they became the elite of the Vietnamese society.
00:37:50,00:37:52,50 of them preferred to live in the mountains.
00:37:52,00:37:55,50 of them preferred to live by the sea.
00:37:55,00:37:58,And they kind of split into these two groups of...
00:37:58,00:37:59,"It's a bit custody battle, isn't it?"
00:37:59,00:38:00,It's a bit...
00:38:00,00:38:02,"Custody was made out of eggs, or..."
00:38:02,00:38:06,"No, you're right."
00:38:06,00:38:09,"It's like half of the people went with the dragon lord,"
00:38:09,00:38:12,and half of them went with the immortal fairy and his families.
00:38:12,00:38:14,"That would have made a cracking version of that film,"
00:38:14,00:38:16,"the parent trap, wouldn't it?"
00:38:16,00:38:18,"Where you've got to get your parents back together,"
00:38:18,00:38:20,but they're a dragon lord and an immortal fairy.
00:38:20,00:38:22,I watched the parent trap last weekend.
00:38:22,00:38:23,That's so weird.
00:38:23,00:38:24,Which version?
00:38:24,00:38:28,The new one with Lindsay Lohan.
00:38:28,00:38:28,"Sorry, heathen."
00:38:28,00:38:29,"Now, you say new."
00:38:29,00:38:30,That's pretty old.
00:38:30,00:38:33,"When I said that Moulin Rouge was a recent film,"
00:38:33,00:38:36,I got the crap kicked out of me on this podcast.
00:38:36,00:38:37,"At its comparison, you knew?"
00:38:37,00:38:39,New compared to the old one.
00:38:39,00:38:43,"I said that Moulin Rouge was recent, compared with the history of film,"
00:38:43,00:38:45,and it didn't cut any ice.
00:38:45,00:38:50,"Anyway, my point is it would have been vastly improved"
00:38:50,00:38:52,if it included some kind of dragon lord feature.
00:38:52,00:38:54,So it's a good comparison.
00:38:54,00:38:58,"I've got a couple of things on modern Vietnamese women,"
00:38:58,00:39:01,"sort of, who are pretty interesting today."
00:39:01,00:39:03,"So I found this really interesting thing,"
00:39:03,00:39:06,"which is the nail industry in America,"
00:39:06,00:39:07,"so for manicures and so on,"
00:39:07,00:39:11,approximately 51% of nail technicians in America
00:39:11,00:39:13,are Vietnamese descendants.
00:39:13,00:39:16,So either Vietnamese-American or have moved over there.
00:39:16,00:39:18,80% in California.
00:39:18,00:39:21,"And this only happened in the last 40 years,"
00:39:21,00:39:24,"and it's as a result, as far as we know,"
00:39:24,00:39:27,"of one single person, which is Tippi Hedren."
00:39:27,00:39:29,"Now, Tippi Hedren, the actor,"
00:39:29,00:39:32,the actor who was in the Alfred Hitchcock movies.
00:39:32,00:39:34,She's the mother of Melanie Griffiths.
00:39:34,00:39:35,"Yeah, she was in The Birds."
00:39:35,00:39:40,She was at refugee camp for Vietnamese in California 40 years ago.
00:39:40,00:39:41,"And while she was there,"
00:39:41,00:39:42,"she thought it'd be good to teach a skill,"
00:39:42,00:39:44,and she noticed that they were all very obsessed
00:39:44,00:39:45,with her beautiful nails.
00:39:45,00:39:47,"She had them beautifully manicured and painted,"
00:39:47,00:39:48,and they all wanted to look at it.
00:39:48,00:39:51,"So she brought her manicurist in,"
00:39:51,00:39:53,and a lot of the women who were there as refugees
00:39:53,00:39:55,were part of the military intelligence.
00:39:55,00:39:57,"So they were sort of high-ranking women,"
00:39:57,00:40:00,"a lot of influence, and they all got taught how to do this."
00:40:00,00:40:04,"And over 40 years, that spread to be a proper way"
00:40:04,00:40:05,"of earning your money in America for them,"
00:40:05,00:40:09,"to the point where it's now 51% of them all descended from this,"
00:40:09,00:40:11,supposedly from this one refugee camp
00:40:11,00:40:14,"that Tippi Hedrin just happened to say,"
00:40:14,00:40:15,"""Who wants to learn how to do this?"""
00:40:15,00:40:16,That is incredible.
00:40:16,00:40:17,Remarkable.
00:40:17,00:40:18,That could be also different
00:40:18,00:40:21,if Tippi Hedrin had brought something else.
00:40:21,00:40:24,"Well, if she taught them, I don't know, bowling,"
00:40:24,00:40:28,it could be like 80% of bowling champions in America
00:40:28,00:40:31,are descended from Vietnamese refugees.
00:40:31,00:40:33,"Oh, thank God it was her and not you."
00:40:33,00:40:34,I feel like Tippi Hedrin had her eye
00:40:34,00:40:36,on the commercial market a bit more than you did.
00:40:38,00:40:40,The demand for bowling tutors wasn't quite what it should be.
00:40:40,00:40:42,"There is money in bowling if you're good, Anna."
00:40:42,00:40:43,And if you...
00:40:43,00:40:45,"The problem is that in America,"
00:40:45,00:40:48,there's so many people who already do bowling
00:40:48,00:40:51,"that even if you have been taught by Tippi Hedrin,"
00:40:51,00:40:54,"it's still going to be quite hard to break into that elite,"
00:40:54,00:40:55,I'm going to say.
00:40:55,00:40:56,"Yeah, I do see what you mean there."
00:40:56,00:40:58,It's a problem.
00:40:58,00:40:58,"Okay, yeah."
00:40:58,00:41:02,I won't try and start this.
00:41:02,00:41:06,"The first female billionaire in Vietnam was not too long ago,"
00:41:06,00:41:08,and it was as a result of something
00:41:08,00:41:11,"which actually slightly sets women back,"
00:41:11,00:41:13,"I would say, via jet air."
00:41:13,00:41:15,"There was this thing, I don't know if you remember,"
00:41:15,00:41:17,the bikini-clad flight attendants.
00:41:17,00:41:20,"This was the idea that they would all dress in bikinis,"
00:41:20,00:41:21,and it became very popular because...
00:41:21,00:41:22,They all have three breasts.
00:41:22,00:41:29,"Wait, so she made her money off that airline?"
00:41:29,00:41:31,"Yeah, she made it go public,"
00:41:31,00:41:33,"and when it went public, it turned her into a billionaire."
00:41:33,00:41:37,And she's the first-ever billionaire from Vietnam.
00:41:37,00:41:38,"See, I mean, do you mind about that?"
00:41:38,00:41:42,"I like women, but I hate billionaires."
00:41:42,00:41:43,It's difficult.
00:41:43,00:41:44,That is tough.
00:41:44,00:41:46,"Well, luckily, there's not many of them."
00:41:46,00:41:47,"Luckily, most of the billionaires are men."
00:41:47,00:41:51,"Yeah, thank God, I still like most women."
00:41:51,00:41:55,"So it's really interesting, I find, about Vietnamese history,"
00:41:55,00:41:57,"which is the fact that it's kind of historical,"
00:41:57,00:42:01,"but at the same time, so much of it is very obviously folklore"
00:42:01,00:42:04,"and not real, and trying to work out what is which."
00:42:04,00:42:07,And I suppose that's quite a lot of similarity
00:42:07,00:42:09,"with things like the Amazons, right,"
00:42:09,00:42:12,which were largely thought to be quite a mythological group
00:42:12,00:42:16,of women who were like warriors who attacked the Greeks
00:42:16,00:42:17,"and attacked various different people,"
00:42:17,00:42:19,"but actually, the more we look at it,"
00:42:19,00:42:21,the more we think that there might have been some truth in it.
00:42:21,00:42:25,So there's this group of people who lived around Ukraine
00:42:25,00:42:27,"and around all the way up to Siberia,"
00:42:27,00:42:29,"and from around the 9th century BC,"
00:42:29,00:42:31,they were attacking the Greeks
00:42:31,00:42:33,"and attacking a lot of different groups around there,"
00:42:33,00:42:36,"but because they were a nomadic tribe,"
00:42:36,00:42:37,"you can't really say,"
00:42:37,00:42:39,"""Well, this group of society will stay at home,"
00:42:39,00:42:41,"and this group of society will go to battle."""
00:42:41,00:42:43,"Basically, everyone had to go everywhere,"
00:42:43,00:42:45,"and so all the women got taught how to fight,"
00:42:45,00:42:47,and we know this because a lot of burials
00:42:47,00:42:50,"have been found of Scythian women,"
00:42:50,00:42:52,"and about one third of them have been buried with weapons,"
00:42:52,00:42:55,which suggests that they will have been warriors.
00:42:55,00:42:59,And so we think now that a lot of the Amazonian stories
00:42:59,00:43:01,that came through classical times
00:43:01,00:43:04,might have been referring to the Scythian women.
00:43:04,00:43:05,-Really? -Yeah.
00:43:05,00:43:06,That makes sense.
00:43:06,00:43:07,Kind of interesting.
00:43:07,00:43:09,"And because of their horse-riding skills,"
00:43:09,00:43:12,they could deliver any package with one-day delivery.
00:43:12,00:43:15,That was the Amazonian promise back in the day.
00:43:15,00:43:24,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:43:24,00:43:25,and that is my fact.
00:43:25,00:43:28,My fact this week is that one of the few incredibly rare times
00:43:28,00:43:32,"a giant squid has been seen attacking an ocean vessel,"
00:43:32,00:43:34,"which was an image made famous by Jules Verne,"
00:43:34,00:43:38,was in 2003 when a boat was attacked while competing
00:43:38,00:43:40,in the Jules Verne Trophy race.
00:43:40,00:43:42,Amazing.
00:43:42,00:43:44,What incredible coincidence.
00:43:44,00:43:46,"So this was, I should say,"
00:43:46,00:43:49,that this was reported by the captain of this ship
00:43:49,00:43:52,"taking part in this race, Olivier de Casalsen,"
00:43:52,00:43:55,and he is a captain who's had over 40 years
00:43:55,00:43:57,"of experience in the ocean,"
00:43:57,00:44:00,and he was taking his boat on this trip
00:44:00,00:44:02,when suddenly it kind of ground to a halt.
00:44:02,00:44:03,"He was thinking, ""What the hell is going on?"""
00:44:03,00:44:08,"And he saw through the port hole this giant squid,"
00:44:08,00:44:09,which was attached to it.
00:44:09,00:44:10,He's never seen anything like this in his life.
00:44:10,00:44:12,"He quickly radioed it in saying,"
00:44:12,00:44:14,"""We've got a giant squid that's attached to the boat."""
00:44:14,00:44:17,"They brought it to a complete halt,"
00:44:17,00:44:18,"so they stopped it completely,"
00:44:18,00:44:21,"and it sort of just disattached itself and went off,"
00:44:21,00:44:23,and that's the last that we saw of it.
00:44:23,00:44:24,So we don't have a photo.
00:44:24,00:44:27,We don't have anything that can sort of completely verify
00:44:27,00:44:30,other than his experience as a sailor
00:44:30,00:44:32,and as a good sailor as well.
00:44:32,00:44:35,So the Jules Verne trophy is to try and beat the record
00:44:35,00:44:36,"of going around the world, isn't it?"
00:44:36,00:44:38,"Did he beat the record, do you know?"
00:44:38,00:44:39,Or...
00:44:39,00:44:41,So the way the Jules Verne trophy works
00:44:41,00:44:44,is you hand over the trophy to someone who beats the record.
00:44:44,00:44:46,"Weirdly, there's a world record,"
00:44:46,00:44:48,"which is separate to the Jules Verne,"
00:44:48,00:44:50,so you have to specifically pay up to this membership group.
00:44:50,00:44:53,"So he did not win it that year in 2003,"
00:44:53,00:44:55,but he did win it in 2004.
00:44:55,00:44:58,"So what I'm thinking, Dan, is in 2003,"
00:44:58,00:45:00,he's sailing around the world.
00:45:00,00:45:01,"He hasn't beaten the record,"
00:45:01,00:45:03,"and when he comes back, he says,"
00:45:03,00:45:05,"""Well, it's because I got attacked by a giant squid."""
00:45:05,00:45:07,"And they say, ""Do you have any photos of it?"""
00:45:07,00:45:09,"And he goes, ""No, I don't have any photos,"
00:45:09,00:45:10,"but I got attacked by a giant squid,"
00:45:10,00:45:12,"and that's why I didn't win the race."""
00:45:12,00:45:15,And I'm not saying that he's lying.
00:45:15,00:45:18,I'm just saying that I'd like some evidence.
00:45:18,00:45:20,"I agree, and I would love to see some three-foot boobs."
00:45:22,00:45:24,We can't all have what we want.
00:45:24,00:45:26,"No, that's absolutely true."
00:45:26,00:45:28,It's not the first thing you do.
00:45:28,00:45:29,If the first thing you do when you're being attacked
00:45:29,00:45:31,"by a giant squid is take a photo of it,"
00:45:31,00:45:33,then you're one of those irritating millennial types
00:45:33,00:45:35,"who's always got your iPhone on you,"
00:45:35,00:45:37,"and actually, they're a big fish to fry,"
00:45:37,00:45:38,like getting it off your boat.
00:45:38,00:45:40,I'm with this guy.
00:45:40,00:45:42,"You know the Jules Verne trophy that you mentioned, Dan?"
00:45:42,00:45:44,Yeah.
00:45:44,00:45:47,"It floats, but it doesn't float just in water."
00:45:47,00:45:49,It floats in air.
00:45:49,00:45:50,What?
00:45:50,00:45:52,This is so cool.
00:45:52,00:45:54,The Jules Verne trophy is a metal sculpture
00:45:54,00:45:55,"of a ship's hull, right?"
00:45:55,00:45:56,And it's quite long.
00:45:56,00:45:58,It looks like it's about six or eight feet long.
00:45:58,00:45:59,"And at the ceremony where you hand it over,"
00:45:59,00:46:02,"because you have to hand it over to the next people to win it,"
00:46:02,00:46:03,"everyone puts on gloves,"
00:46:03,00:46:06,and you take it out of its case where it is floating
00:46:06,00:46:08,on top of a magnetic field.
00:46:08,00:46:10,"You hand it to the guys who've won it,"
00:46:10,00:46:13,and they put it back in this huge glass case
00:46:13,00:46:14,"in a magnetic field,"
00:46:14,00:46:16,"so it just hovers there in mid-air,"
00:46:16,00:46:18,and then they put it away again.
00:46:18,00:46:18,That's quite cool.
00:46:18,00:46:19,It's a floating trophy.
00:46:19,00:46:20,Isn't that awesome?
00:46:20,00:46:21,Why does it?
00:46:22,00:46:24,Because of the magnetic field.
00:46:24,00:46:25,"Yeah, but just because it's cool, right?"
00:46:25,00:46:26,That's the idea.
00:46:26,00:46:27,"Yeah, because it's cool."
00:46:27,00:46:27,Yeah.
00:46:27,00:46:28,Great.
00:46:28,00:46:28,That's Jules Verne.
00:46:28,00:46:30,He's a science fiction writer.
00:46:30,00:46:30,"Well, here's the thing."
00:46:30,00:46:32,It's a cool science fiction thing.
00:46:32,00:46:34,"Jules Verne, the reason that this is named after him"
00:46:34,00:46:37,"is because it's around the world in 80 days, right?"
00:46:37,00:46:38,Which is what he wrote.
00:46:38,00:46:40,Can you name any kind of transport
00:46:40,00:46:42,that Philius Fogg used in around the world in 80 days?
00:46:42,00:46:44,"Balloon, hot air balloon."
00:46:44,00:46:44,Hot air balloon.
00:46:44,00:46:46,"Amazingly not, right?"
00:46:46,00:46:49,"In the book, he doesn't go in a hot air balloon at any stage."
00:46:49,00:46:51,It's so weird.
00:46:51,00:46:53,"It's if you look at in all the Disney films,"
00:46:53,00:46:55,he's always in a hot air balloon.
00:46:55,00:46:57,And if you look at like lots of the books
00:46:57,00:46:58,"with an illustration on the front,"
00:46:58,00:47:00,there's always a hot air balloon in it
00:47:00,00:47:01,or on the post or whatever.
00:47:01,00:47:04,"But no, he just goes by train and by boat."
00:47:04,00:47:05,"I mean, it would be a much more boring Disney film,"
00:47:05,00:47:05,wouldn't it?
00:47:05,00:47:07,Just a guy getting trains around.
00:47:07,00:47:10,It's a commute.
00:47:10,00:47:10,It's a film.
00:47:10,00:47:12,"That's a Michael Portello documentary,"
00:47:12,00:47:15,not the most thrilling novel of the 19th century.
00:47:15,00:47:16,That's fascinating.
00:47:16,00:47:19,"I think the first thing he wrote was about balloon, wasn't it?"
00:47:19,00:47:21,"It was a short story about a cool something,"
00:47:21,00:47:22,like adventures in a balloon.
00:47:22,00:47:25,"And I feel like people must have conflated those,"
00:47:25,00:47:28,"an inflated, conflated and inflated balloon."
00:47:28,00:47:31,You don't inflate a balloon.
00:47:31,00:47:33,"One of those hot air balloons, do you?"
00:47:33,00:47:33,Don't you?
00:47:33,00:47:34,You certainly do.
00:47:34,00:47:34,Yeah.
00:47:34,00:47:37,"That wasn't the main problem with that joke, I have to say."
00:47:37,00:47:39,The technical issue.
00:47:39,00:47:41,"Yeah, right."
00:47:41,00:47:43,It had it.
00:47:43,00:47:45,"Jules Verne had an amazing life, didn't he?"
00:47:45,00:47:45,Yeah.
00:47:45,00:47:46,"I loved the fact as a boy,"
00:47:46,00:47:48,his uncle was the mayor of Brains.
00:47:49,00:47:50,Really?
00:47:50,00:47:50,Yeah.
00:47:50,00:47:54,I'm not sure I'm pronouncing the French town of Brains correctly.
00:47:54,00:47:54,"Oh, really?"
00:47:54,00:47:55,How's the spell?
00:47:55,00:47:56,It's spell Brains.
00:47:56,00:48:01,"He was mates with Alexandre Dumas, amongst other people,"
00:48:01,00:48:03,who was this great inspiration for him.
00:48:03,00:48:08,"And actually, kind of sadly, Dumas' son once wrote to Jules Verne,"
00:48:08,00:48:13,"saying that he considered Verne the true son of Dumas over himself,"
00:48:13,00:48:16,which shows a real lack of self-confidence.
00:48:16,00:48:18,What did he write?
00:48:18,00:48:19,"He wrote Musketeers, was that it?"
00:48:19,00:48:21,"Yeah, and Monte Cristo."
00:48:21,00:48:21,Yes.
00:48:21,00:48:24,"Sorry, Andy, for your pronunciation in French,"
00:48:24,00:48:26,you might know him as an Alexandre Dumas.
00:48:26,00:48:33,"Do you guys know how Jules Verne and Dumas first met, apparently?"
00:48:33,00:48:36,In a hot air balloon.
00:48:36,00:48:37,Nice.
00:48:37,00:48:38,It's almost as cool.
00:48:38,00:48:41,This is actually something that was sent in by a listener
00:48:41,00:48:45,"called Elly's Cramer, and it's from a 1954 article"
00:48:45,00:48:48,"about a party that Verne was at, where he was kind of bored"
00:48:48,00:48:50,and he was a bit of a rogue.
00:48:50,00:48:55,And I think he was referred to as witty and impudent in the article.
00:48:55,00:48:58,"And so he decided to leave, and he left by sliding down the banister."
00:48:58,00:49:02,"Slid down the banister, smashed straight into someone at the bottom,"
00:49:02,00:49:05,"like smashed into his torso, so stood up, didn't know what to say."
00:49:05,00:49:07,"So the first thing that came to his head said,"
00:49:07,00:49:08,"""Have you had dinner?"""
00:49:08,00:49:10,Quite an odd thing to say to a stranger.
00:49:10,00:49:12,"And the man replied he'd had an omelet,"
00:49:12,00:49:15,at which Verne said no one could make an omelet as well as he could.
00:49:15,00:49:18,"And so this guy was like, ""All right, you make such a good omelet."
00:49:18,00:49:21,"Make me an omelet. I'll come around for dinner next Wednesday."""
00:49:21,00:49:22,And he gave him...
00:49:22,00:49:24,It's the story.
00:49:24,00:49:26,It's a true story.
00:49:26,00:49:31,"This guy handed over his business card, and it was Alexandre Dumas."
00:49:31,00:49:35,"This sounds like, you know, if you and your partner met on Tinder or something,"
00:49:35,00:49:37,"and you're like, ""Well, we're going to have to come up with a story"
00:49:37,00:49:39,"""when everybody asks us how we met."""
00:49:39,00:49:43,I'll say that I made an omelet. You say you were coming down the banister.
00:49:43,00:49:47,"Yeah. Omelet was the original eggplant emoji, I think."
00:49:47,00:49:49,Seems there was a sexual thing going on there.
00:49:49,00:49:53,"So the thing about Jules Verne is, in Britain,"
00:49:53,00:49:57,"I would say we kind of see him as more of a kid's author, right?"
00:49:57,00:50:02,Because I certainly read a lot of his stuff when I was a teenager or younger still.
00:50:02,00:50:07,"And the reason is because he had really bad translations into English,"
00:50:07,00:50:11,"so in France and in Russia and in lots of different countries,"
00:50:11,00:50:13,he's seen as quite a serious author.
00:50:13,00:50:15,"But in Britain, he's more of a kid's author."
00:50:15,00:50:18,And these translations were just bad.
00:50:18,00:50:22,And the thing about his translations I find really interesting is
00:50:22,00:50:26,that the British ones were then translated into Japanese.
00:50:26,00:50:32,"So in Japan, they get a translated version of the English stuff, not the French stuff."
00:50:32,00:50:35,"I mean, obviously, these days, you get better translations."
00:50:35,00:50:37,But the original Japanese ones.
00:50:37,00:50:41,"And then in China, they translated the Japanese ones,"
00:50:41,00:50:45,"which had been translated from English, which had been translated from French."
00:50:45,00:50:49,So you get this weird sort of Chinese whispers things going on.
00:50:49,00:50:53,"But also in Chinese kind of oral tradition, as a storyteller,"
00:50:53,00:50:57,"you would kind of add your own little footnotes and stuff like that, right?"
00:50:57,00:51:01,"And so the original French one section of, I think,"
00:51:01,00:51:05,"I've not written down what bucket is, but I think it's around the world in 80 days."
00:51:05,00:51:07,And really apologies for my French here.
00:51:07,00:51:09,"But it says something like,"
00:51:09,00:51:21,[speaking French]
00:51:21,00:51:25,"So it says, after the Civil War, a new club that was very influential"
00:51:25,00:51:29,"was established in Baltimore, which is in Maryland."
00:51:29,00:51:34,And the Chinese version becomes anyone who has studied world geography and history
00:51:34,00:51:36,knows of a place called America.
00:51:36,00:51:40,"As for the American War of Independence, not the Civil War, by the way,"
00:51:40,00:51:43,"even children know that it was an earth-shattering event,"
00:51:43,00:51:46,a deed that ought to be recalled often and never forgotten.
00:51:46,00:51:49,"Now, among all those states that participated in the war,"
00:51:49,00:51:53,"one of them was called Maryland, whose capital, Baltimore, not the capital,"
00:51:53,00:51:58,was a famous city teeming with crowds and packed with the traffic of horses and carriages
00:51:58,00:52:01,"in this city was a club, magnificent in appearance,"
00:52:01,00:52:06,"and as soon as you saw the high-flying American flag flapping in the wind in front,"
00:52:06,00:52:09,you naturally felt a sense of awe.
00:52:09,00:52:13,Amazing translation of that one sentence.
00:52:13,00:52:17,"And someone who doesn't want to be a translator, they want to be an author."
00:52:17,00:52:19,A translation.
00:52:19,00:52:22,Also being paid by the word.
00:52:22,00:52:26,And the only thing people are going to write in about is the reference to Maryland
00:52:26,00:52:28,"Oh, Maryland, yeah."
00:52:28,00:52:30,"I'll be furious, James."
00:52:30,00:52:32,Pronouncing things.
00:52:32,00:52:35,"Not so easy now, is it?"
00:52:35,00:52:39,"There was a guy who claimed to be the real Philius Fogg,"
00:52:39,00:52:41,who was called George Francis Train.
00:52:41,00:52:44,"We've mentioned him once before, actually, I think."
00:52:44,00:52:49,"So he went around the world in 1870, and then the book was published at about 1873,"
00:52:49,00:52:54,"give or take, but he had already travelled around the world supposedly in 80 days."
00:52:54,00:53:00,"Yes, so he was 80 days travelling, but he stopped off in Paris for two months."
00:53:00,00:53:04,"During his time, he was arrested and sent to prison for two weeks."
00:53:04,00:53:08,"And I think it might have been Dumas who got him out of prison, actually."
00:53:08,00:53:13,"But he was basically, it wasn't really an 80-day full trip."
00:53:13,00:53:17,"But the first person who did it in under 80 days, I think, was Nellie Bly,"
00:53:17,00:53:20,"who did it in 1890, right?"
00:53:20,00:53:22,And she did it in '72.
00:53:22,00:53:23,"Yeah, that's right."
00:53:23,00:53:26,"And released the book around the world in '72, Day."
00:53:26,00:53:29,Very unimaginative. I think you could sue her for that.
00:53:29,00:53:33,"But she also, she pit-stocked and said hi to Jules Verne along the way."
00:53:33,00:53:35,How meta is that?
00:53:35,00:53:39,That is weird. It's like your book's coming to life in front of your very eyes.
00:53:39,00:53:41,"So she was a journalist, right?"
00:53:41,00:53:46,"And she was working for, was it the New York World?"
00:53:46,00:53:48,"It was for Pulitzer, anyway."
00:53:48,00:53:53,"So she was working for Pulitzer and she said, ""I want to go around the world in 80 days"
00:53:53,00:53:56,"and I want to write my story about it."""
00:53:56,00:53:58,She was an investigative journalist.
00:53:58,00:54:03,And the newspaper had a Nellie Bly guessing match where people could guess exactly how long it would take her
00:54:03,00:54:08,to get around the world by the minute.
00:54:08,00:54:10,"And if you got the closest, then you'd win a prize."
00:54:10,00:54:15,"And she travelled by ship, train and donkey, the three things that she used."
00:54:15,00:54:19,It feels like the ship and the train probably did most of the legs.
00:54:19,00:54:24,"When she met Verne in Paris, she, he said, ""You know, I'm so impressed by you."
00:54:24,00:54:31,"If you manage to do this in 79 days, I'll applaud with both hands."""
00:54:31,00:54:34,"I'll ask you a question, what the alternative way of applauding is."
00:54:34,00:54:38,"Yeah, she was cool. She, they didn't want to send her around at first, I don't think."
00:54:38,00:54:41,So she had this idea and she insisted on being sent around the world.
00:54:41,00:54:46,"And first, the editor of the New York World said, ""No, a woman can't do this, I'm afraid."""
00:54:46,00:54:52,"And she said very well, ""Start the man and I'll start the same day for some other newspaper and beat him."""
00:54:52,00:54:57,"And so then they caved and she sort of put one outfit, few changes of underwear."
00:54:57,00:54:59,"But she had a rival, didn't she?"
00:54:59,00:55:03,"This woman called Elizabeth Bisland, who was sent round by Cosmo."
00:55:03,00:55:09,And it was the sort of classy alternative to Nellie Bly who was racing her basically.
00:55:09,00:55:13,"But Nellie didn't know to begin with, right? So she was engaged in a race she wasn't aware of."
00:55:13,00:55:17,"And then when she found out, she just didn't care if she was like, ""I'm not doing this for a race."""
00:55:17,00:55:22,"Oh really? Yeah, what? She claimed she didn't care, but she sprinted away when she was told."
00:55:22,00:55:28,I'd rather see if they're going to remake Around the World in 80 Days for one billionth time or whatever for Disney.
00:55:28,00:55:35,Then I would much rather see the Nellie Bly versus this woman from Cosmo trying to race around the world in 80 days
00:55:35,00:55:37,rather than some Philly as a card character.
00:55:37,00:55:41,"It's not great spectator, I guess, because the race is very much two quite separate people."
00:55:41,00:55:43,You just have to keep cutting between them.
00:55:43,00:55:47,She said apparently the moment when she found out was in Hong Kong.
00:55:47,00:55:51,And so Nellie Bly arrived in Hong Kong and Elizabeth Bisland was beating her at the time.
00:55:51,00:55:56,"And in fact, I think it was beating her until she got back to Britain where she was told she'd missed her boat,"
00:55:56,00:56:00,which was actually a lie. She hadn't missed her boat. No one knows if that was a trick.
00:56:00,00:56:03,"But when Nellie Bly got to Hong Kong, a guy who met her there said,"
00:56:03,00:56:06,"""Oh, are you the one that's racing the other person?"""
00:56:06,00:56:10,"And Nellie said, ""Yeah, I'm in a race. I'm in a race with time."""
00:56:10,00:56:13,"And the guy said, ""I don't think that was her name."""
00:56:13,00:56:17,Thus she discovered.
00:56:17,00:56:22,It is a good premise for a film because one of them is all working for Cosmo.
00:56:22,00:56:25,It's all kind of high powered and doing it in high heels and it'll scrubbed up.
00:56:25,00:56:29,And the other one's Nellie Bly who's sort of a street urchin vibe to her.
00:56:29,00:56:33,"That's what I was saying. It's amazing. And then it's a bit like Race Around the World,"
00:56:33,00:56:40,"where you make them have to stop in London and meet each other and stay in the same hotel and talk about, you know..."
00:56:40,00:56:43,And they become friendly in the way.
00:56:43,00:56:45,"Working up. Yeah, they become friends."
00:56:45,00:56:50,"No, but they become enemies, but they respect each other like superheroes and super enemies."
00:56:50,00:56:53,Like forgers and their chasers.
00:56:53,00:56:56,"Another part of Nellie Bly's life, which would have been a good movie,"
00:56:56,00:57:00,"is when she exposed all the insane asylums in America,"
00:57:00,00:57:08,because she pretended to be insane and got herself committed to an asylum on Blackwells Island in New York.
00:57:08,00:57:12,And it was basically an expose of how badly treated these sick people were.
00:57:12,00:57:17,"She showed that they were doing beatings and ice cold baths and forced meals,"
00:57:17,00:57:20,including really rotten butter and rotten food.
00:57:20,00:57:25,"And that actually changed the way that asylums works in America, thanks to her expose."
00:57:25,00:57:28,But she never got out. That's the sad thing.
00:57:28,00:57:31,"She kept saying, ""I'm a journalist. I've just been writing an expose."""
00:57:31,00:57:33,"Sure you are, yeah."
00:57:33,00:57:36,"I've been around the world for 80 days. Yeah, right."
00:57:36,00:57:42,And the nurse turns around and suddenly you see it's Elizabeth Diskin standing there.
00:57:42,00:57:45,No!
00:57:45,00:57:49,Roll credit.
00:57:49,00:57:53,"Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening."
