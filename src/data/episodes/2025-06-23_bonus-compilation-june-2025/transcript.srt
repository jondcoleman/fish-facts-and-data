00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:06,880
 Howdy club fish members. How you doing? Down here. We have a compilation episode for you today.

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:11,920
 This is the best bits of the stuff that didn't make it into the main episodes, little outtakes,

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,120
 little extra bits of info that didn't quite fit the narrative of the show or bung together here

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:24,720
 for you, starring the four fishers plus John Lloyd, the QI Supremo. So I hope you enjoy that.

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,760
 This should be hitting the club fish page on Tuesday, which means we're just under two weeks

6
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:36,480
 away from doing our next live show, which is happening in Sheffield at the Crossed wires festival,

7
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,640
 which is going to say that if you are thinking of coming, we are on the edge of selling out,

8
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,720
 and so don't leave it to last minute, because there might not be any tickets left.

9
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:49,760
 You can find them again in no such thing as a fish.com. It can be really fun night. I think the show is

10
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,280
 about 85 minutes. We're going to be doing really fun things like we're going to enter someone

11
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,120
 into the fish Hall of Fame, a local from Sheffield, who has been mentioned previously on the episode,

12
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,280
 so they'll be up on stage with us, or at least that's the plan. We might try out something new

13
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,080
 altogether. It's always fun doing these live shows, and we'd love to see you there. So come along,

14
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,600
 but for now, enjoy the compilation episode. Here we go.

15
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:33,760
 I had a quick hunt, by the way, because Marie's plums. Nice to have something named after you,

16
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:40,000
 Andy. I wanted to see if we had any other fruits that were relevant to us, the other three of us.

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:54,320
 So I found Harkin Peaches. I was just reading up to see if there were any similarities. So I found

18
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:01,520
 someone who actually farms them, and they say that normally Harkin trees are pretty finicky producers.

19
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:07,120
 I'm a finicky producer when it comes to TV production. You're covered in a lovely soft fuzz.

20
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:19,200
 You don't have a Toshinsky, but you have an Anna, which is Anna's apple, which is Anna Bowlin's.

21
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:29,920
 After all, Anna Bowlin. I'm not sure. That's not make assumptions. That's a leap. That's a leap.

22
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,760
 Maybe they've got her head. Well, in some of the photos, it is quite a flat apple. They didn't take

23
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:43,520
 photos at the time. What? Oh, right, of the apple. Is it? In some photos, there's different shapes to it,

24
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:48,800
 so yeah, I got excited. I've been to two of Ambulin's homes in the last month. Ambulin's following me

25
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:56,640
 around at the moment. No, you're following her around. These other detectors, like the weird

26
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,840
 ways people have tried to detect neutrinos, because lots of countries have got their own ones

27
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,520
 around the place. So there's one in Japan, which is a tank of 50,000 tonnes of ultra-pure water

28
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:10,480
 under a mountain. That's called the super cameo candy. And scientists have to get rafts around the

29
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,040
 surface of this. What on the ultra-pure water? They were around on it. I shot that clean the raft

30
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,240
 before they go in. They probably have one of those little, you know, a little puddle of clean water

31
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,920
 that you walk through so that you don't get varuchas. Yeah, definitely. And they'll have a pool robot

32
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,440
 on the inside, just getting anything else. They're just a guy with his top off at a long net.

33
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:38,560
 Then the first detector built in the 60s by Raymond Davis, Jr. and John Buckle was a tank

34
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,160
 with half a million litres of dry cleaning fluid in it. Oh, yeah. What? Yeah, it has more uses, I guess.

35
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,240
 Dry cleaning fluid? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I actually don't know if I know what dry, you mean,

36
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:54,320
 like washing fluid? No, it's a chemical you use, isn't it? I can't remember what it's called now.

37
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,960
 Never been to dry cleaners. Wouldn't know. But, cool. Glad it's got another even better application.

38
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,360
 Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, yeah. That's really cool. And there's one called Dune in America.

39
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:10,560
 It's two. It's underground. It is underground, like the worms, but there are two detectors,

40
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,400
 800 miles apart. One is pointing at the other one. You know, plums have stones in them.

41
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,480
 They're unique to the species that stone. You know all the, like, the little bumps and stuff

42
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,800
 that you get. Like a fingerprint? Like a fingerprint. So you know which plum is burgled you?

43
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:33,680
 What do you mean you need to the species? Sorry. So if you get a little plum stone, it's got loads

44
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,760
 of wrinkles on it. And you have a buck which has all the different patterns. You'll be able to tell

45
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,000
 which species a plum it comes from or which variety. Wow, it matches the same dense in the

46
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:51,680
 stone. Yeah, yeah, exactly. And so in the Murray Rose ship, oh, we sang when 16th century,

47
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:59,680
 and then they raised it in 20th century. They found all these stones, all these plum stones,

48
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,680
 and they could tell exactly what species they were. And they went or what variety they were.

49
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,240
 And they went back to the National Fruit Centre, which I think we might have mentioned before.

50
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,640
 Yes. And checked it against modern fruits. And they could see exactly what they were.

51
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:19,360
 Oh my goodness. That's insane. So actually they share fingerprints. So if you're one species of plum,

52
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,680
 then you can blame the burglary on your mate who's the same species because you've left the same

53
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,680
 print. It's almost like every family would have the same or something like that. That's a nice

54
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:37,760
 time. Yeah. Every time. Professor plum. Yeah. So plum's blue gold, they're called in Serbia.

55
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,400
 They have 40 million plum trees, and at least three plum festivals every year in Serbia.

56
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,280
 Brilliant. And if you have Schlippervitz,

57
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:54,320
 Serbian drink, the National Drink, then that's plum flavoured usually.

58
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,040
 Oh god. Is that the thing they give you at the end of every meal whenever you go to one of those

59
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:06,000
 countries? Yeah. If you're in like Serbia, Montenegro, some parts of Bosnia, and they give you that,

60
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,320
 have it, because if you don't, you're insulting them, but you're going to regret it the next day.

61
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,240
 Is it like all of those things where it claims to be flavoured with expert tastes like petrol?

62
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,160
 Yeah, it tastes really strong. It's not quite chemical. There's often a thing where...

63
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,200
 I don't know if this is your experience, but where if you're there with someone of the opposite sex,

64
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:29,120
 so in my experience, my wife would be given a reasonably nice spirit, and I would be given something

65
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,880
 that was absolutely lighter flowing. It's a slightly blocier thing to get. And she's got a

66
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,120
 little bit of plum brandy or something and I'm just drinking pure diesel. I must admit,

67
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,520
 whenever I've been with Serbians and the, um, Schlippervitz has come out, usually everyone's getting

68
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,360
 involved. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I've never had that experience. They must think of you as

69
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:55,760
 particularly manly. What they've seen my plums see there.

70
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:04,640
 The venison general, I didn't know how it's built, so I knew it was lagoonie. I knew it's in the

71
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:10,880
 middle of a lagoon. There wasn't a road or rail link until the middle of the 19th century,

72
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:17,120
 but it was built. What I didn't know is that it is how it's on stills. So every building is built on

73
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,960
 these wooden poles, which have been driven down into the sediment. And if you drive down

74
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,840
 enough poles, it's like 9 or 10 per square meter. You can just put stone on top of that and it all

75
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:36,160
 appears. So the Church of San Marco required 10,000 oak trees to be converted into poles.

76
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,520
 For one church. For one church, it's a big church. The whole of Venice must be way even more than that.

77
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:47,440
 It's millions. Millions and millions of these poles. It's like it's an inverted forest. It's so cool.

78
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,760
 And this was literally 1500 years ago, wasn't it? I mean, this is in the 5th century or whatever,

79
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:56,320
 which is extraordinary that they were able to do that. I think and the good thing is because they're

80
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:02,480
 underwater and they're all underwater, right? So you've got the rocks on top, but the poles themselves

81
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,640
 never go above the water. And that means they don't rot because there's no oxygen to make them

82
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:12,400
 rock. So they stay on the water and they're still now. The ones from 1500 years ago are still good.

83
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,600
 They're not kind of falling apart. It's amazing. And there was a drum, the batty pally, the pile hitters.

84
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:23,520
 That was their job was to pound the piles into the ground. You need a big hammer for that, don't you?

85
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,080
 How are you doing that? What do you do? I didn't often work experience on a farm once and I had to.

86
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:34,480
 When you're building a fence, you have this big metal drum which is open at one end and it's got two

87
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,320
 handles. It's like a milk churn, basically, but you put it upside down. You put it over the stake.

88
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,480
 You're banging into the ground, the stake banging, and you just lift it up and bang down it goes.

89
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,640
 It's such a hard work. But in water, that must be really difficult. Oh, with a whole sort of tree,

90
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,320
 you basically, you've got to be so strong. You've got to be so strong. Yeah, and they had their

91
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,040
 traditional song, which was all about Venice and its glory and death to the Turks, like good

92
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,080
 traditional stuff. And even now in Venice, there's a phrase "na testa de baté pay" which means

93
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,800
 a head that is good to pound down the piles. Are you a bit thick? You know, you're going to head to

94
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,880
 useful for banging it. And now we're going to talk about why you only lasted an afternoon of work

95
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,440
 experience on that farm. Yeah, I've been slated for a seven-year contract of stake banging,

96
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:21,680
 but I got tired. It's really hard work. You know George Foreman's Grill, most famous grill of all

97
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,240
 time. It's shifted like over 100 million units. Is it a barbecue? No, no, it's like a grill.

98
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,800
 You sort of, you host your maker. It looks exactly like one, but it's for meat. And it's positioned

99
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:39,920
 on an angle so that all of the juices sort of run down and away. And he's made more, he made,

100
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,000
 because he's passed away now, more money off the back of that than his entire boxing career by

101
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,880
 subestantial amount. He's made like between 200 and 500 million off of it, because he was getting 40%

102
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,600
 of the deal. But most people mistook him as the creator of it. But in fact, it was this brilliant

103
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:59,280
 innovator who was called Michael Bohm, who was the person who started it. He went to George Foreman

104
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:05,280
 and Hulk Hogan to say which one of you could do it, or he went to the same agent who had both of

105
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:10,320
 them. Foreman got it in the end. But this guy, no one believed him that he invented it. So he used to

106
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:16,080
 walk around with the patent on him any time that someone said, you're not the inventor. He was a,

107
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,600
 am I not? Have a look at my patent. Not talking to him at a party. That's what that's like.

108
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:26,160
 He's a t-shirt saying, I invented the George Foreman Grill is deterring me. And the arm is not talking to

109
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,680
 you at a party, but a serious trouble. Yeah, Mitterrand, Francois Mitterrand, isn't it?

110
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:37,600
 The reason one. Yeah, very recent. He had a wife, but he also had a mistress in the dark. He

111
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,960
 basically lived a double life. And it was his wife, Danielle, who insisted that it was kept secret

112
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:48,960
 from the press. And basically, the press all knew about it, but they like decided they wouldn't

113
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:54,720
 print anything. France, they're ultra conservative about exposing their leaders. They really are.

114
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,680
 They're very, very cautious about it. I suppose it's weird because they're conservative about

115
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,800
 that, but they are much more liberal as we famously know about relationships. So Mitterrand's situation

116
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:10,640
 was so interesting. Before he became president, he lived in a house with his wife and his wife's

117
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:16,960
 lover, who had just had a separate room in their house. And when he became president, Dan don't

118
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:21,920
 think about it. I thought he struck you there, though, to make that noise. But when he did become

119
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,840
 president, they like his staff moved to the woman Anne, who he was having this affair with,

120
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,800
 into a house, it was nice and near him. So he could go through all the time. And they employed a guy

121
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:36,160
 to make sure that no one printed anything about them. So there was this guy called Grand Swad,

122
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:41,280
 The Grosse of, and whenever any journalist sort of sniffed around, they said, we're going to do an

123
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,760
 article about this separate life you have. At one stage, they got a journalist and kidnapped him

124
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:51,120
 and locked him in the cell for a week, saying, oh my god. And then it's like it's a bigger story.

125
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,560
 And then in 2021, it turned out that he wasn't living a double life. After all, he was living a triple

126
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:02,960
 life. And there was another woman called Claire, who was 50 years his junior, who that he was having

127
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:07,440
 affair with the whole time as well. I actually think he was having lots of shags along the way. But yeah,

128
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,920
 Claire again, it was so interesting. It was just like very different standards that I can't judge.

129
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:20,080
 So she Claire had followed him for four years, when she was 18 to 22. And then eventually invited

130
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:24,720
 him around her house. And they had basically what seems like quite a nice relationship for the last

131
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:31,600
 10 years of his life alongside his marriage. It's one interpretation. And then people could say that

132
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,600
 it was an appropriate. Yeah, you could say that there's a massive massive power imbalance.

133
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,840
 You could say that. Yes, although she's definitely more physically able. And the staff all said it

134
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:44,640
 was great because she could go on official visits with him and because she was so young, even in

135
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:49,760
 France, no one suspected that they were together. So she used to accompany him. Brilliant. In many

136
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:59,200
 ways, the perfect crime. I want to stress the word cry. Yeah. But all of this stuff about method

137
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:06,480
 acting for method. I love. It's about to Stanislavsky does. Yes. Russian, Russian acting coach.

138
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:12,000
 Yeah. Constantin Stanislavsky. And he founded this realistic acting stuff. And all acting was

139
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,120
 very unrealistic on film because it was silent film. So you have to have big theatrical gestures

140
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:22,560
 and movements and theater as well. Exactly. And then it all changed as when the close-up is

141
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:28,480
 invented. Suddenly you zoom right in on someone's face and they're going, they look like they're

142
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:34,960
 overacting crazily. And so then you could do the less is more school. But then Stanislavsky

143
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:39,120
 founded this sort of realistic acting stuff. Yeah. And you would go in and you'd be an actor in

144
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:45,920
 Stanislavsky's Moscow theatre. And you would do your lines and he would just go, I don't believe you.

145
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,920
 And you do them again. He go, I don't believe you. I don't believe you. I don't believe you. And you

146
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,760
 just say that again and again and again until it was right. That was genuinely giving me a flashback

147
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,000
 to my clown school days. It's horrible. It's horrible when someone hates what you're doing and they

148
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,040
 and they won't let you go. But Stanislavsky in fairness, he walked the walk. So he did that method

149
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:09,760
 himself and whenever he was acting apart he would go for a walk in Yalta. Like he had a big sort of theatre

150
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,320
 in Crimea and he would go for a walk in his character every single morning. Everyone would laugh at him

151
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,520
 and point at him but he didn't really mind because he was just trying to get into character.

152
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:23,200
 I really respect the lack of social fear that you have to have to do. Like Daniel Day-Lewis

153
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,360
 just having the guts to do it. And I really like the fact I thought he was a bit of a dick for doing

154
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,200
 it but then you read interviews and he said he does it for fun which I can really empathise with.

155
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,280
 It's like he says I do it to play. Also it's the director saying yeah we'll pay for you to

156
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:42,720
 like live in Prague and learn Czech. But do you know the famous story and the great story about

157
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,000
 method acting? I found something out about that. You know the Dustin Hoffman,

158
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,960
 Lawrence Olivier Tail which is that when they were filming Marathon Man with Dustin Hoffman

159
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:56,400
 in the 80s was it and Dustin Hoffman stagged in one day and there's one bit of Marathon Man

160
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,640
 where the lead character that Dustin Hoffman's playing has to have been awake for three days straight

161
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:07,040
 and he stagged in and says to Lawrence Olivier I stayed awake for three days preparing for this

162
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,680
 character. I feel like absolute shit and he's haggin in his hairs all over the place and Lawrence

163
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,960
 Olivier just turned him put his hand on his shoulder and said my dear why don't you try acting?

164
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:24,000
 Anyway famous story. Dustin Hoffman has said he wasn't actually doing it to prepare. He'd just been

165
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,040
 out on the booze for three nights straight. And I think maybe he's trying to sound cool now

166
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,120
 because he said he comes across as the loser in that story. As Lawrence Olivier is the aloof.

167
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:39,440
 It was also dead so there's no you can't come back and say he's lying. He's lying. Exactly. I love

168
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,720
 there's a story which is sort of method acting. Steve Martin when he did Roxanne the movie he has a

169
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,320
 giant nose right Pinocchio long. They were in a small town and they were filming and he finished a

170
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,480
 day and really needed a drink so it takes a long time to take the prosthetic off so he's like I'm

171
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,200
 just going for a drink. But then he sort of got cold feet while he was out and I've got this giant

172
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:02,800
 nose. I'm going to walk into a bar. No one knows really who I am out here and he gets into a bar

173
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:08,560
 and it does the classic piano stops playing. Everyone turns around and he's freaking out thinking oh

174
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,360
 go what am I doing? I'm going to get my ass kicked walks up to the bar and I grew some looking dude

175
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:20,400
 according to him walks up to him and says hey why the long face. Beautiful. Come on. Great

176
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:28,400
 a story I've ever heard. Love. He's better on paper. Avant de Gaulle. She's an interesting character.

177
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:34,640
 Charles de Gaulle's wife. Exactly. Yeah so she was the first lady of France and she there was a story

178
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:40,080
 that while sort of his retirement was imminent she was at Buckingham Palace and I guess asked her

179
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:46,240
 what are you most looking forward to in your retirement. She said a penis. I mean it's almost the

180
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:53,520
 origin of that joke. She was saying happiness but it was oh god and then Steve Martin walked in

181
00:16:53,520 --> 00:17:02,480
 and she's just on my jokes. It's your fault. History's jokes. But yeah she's a very interesting

182
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,120
 character. While we're talking about censorship as the top bit of this fact she was very much

183
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,760
 against things like displays of nudity and sex and tried to have things pass so that they wouldn't

184
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,800
 be shown in public. Many skirts were a problem for her as well. She wanted the lengthening of a skirt

185
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:22,240
 to have to actually be legally asserted in length and then there's this amazing thing. You know there

186
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,960
 was an assassination attempt on on shot. Oh well there was one of both of them. I mean he was one of

187
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:31,440
 the most almost as opposed to better history. So 1962 they get ambushed while they're in their car

188
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,560
 and it's machine gun fire. They both survive her first words after she got out of the car were

189
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:50,320
 a penis. Please cut out the earlier efforts. I think I'll really. A first question was how were

190
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:56,720
 my chickens? And it's because she just bought some chickens in jelly at some fair at some

191
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:04,320
 floor. That still was more concerned to her. That machine gun bullets might have absolutely

192
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,240
 proliterated them. But they're in the car. They're in the boot the car. Yeah. God what could have

193
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,920
 happened? Like even if you're chicken get shot by a bullet. Maybe they're red chickens that you

194
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:16,480
 only get at that one fair once a year. You know I get it. Okay. Fair enough. I'll be your question too.

195
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:26,160
 The cockle van. More like cockle boot. Coggo van with a name. There you go. Yes. There's a joke in

196
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:32,400
 that somewhere. Absolutely. Mongolia barbecue is quite cool. It's called boo dog. What you do is

197
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,080
 you take your. You frighten a dog. It leaps into the fire and then pops your uncle. I think if

198
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,240
 you told the dog about this they get frightened. So you get your animal. Let's say it's a mammoth.

199
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:48,640
 You cut it open from its head to its groin. Slice it right down. You take out all the insides.

200
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:54,640
 You season them and then you stuff them back in again with stones and veggies and you put it over a

201
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,040
 fire and you just leave it over the fire for ages and ages and then you bring it out and you

202
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:04,960
 eat all the insides and the stones are now really really hot and you pass them around the group.

203
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,120
 Everyone gets to hold the stones in their hand. Why? Well I was going to ask you that.

204
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:16,400
 Why would you want to do that? It gets quite cold in Mongolia I guess. It does at times.

205
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,480
 Yeah. It's warmer this way. This is supposed to move. Put on your hand. It's like a hot plate.

206
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,320
 It just keeps it a bit warm. Oh yeah. Good call. Apparently it's supposed to help against stress.

207
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:32,880
 Okay. Hold it in very hot stones. I feel stressed. How fast is the fastest submarine?

208
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:40,240
 Ooh I bet you can give it in. Give it an MPH if you want. This is the underwater sea record.

209
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:46,640
 Also 50. Oh really? I've had some 50 miles an hour for it. I was going to say 200.

210
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,240
 I'm so less. There's a lot of water resistance in there and they're so big and fat.

211
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:57,920
 I'm going to say 30. No that's mad. 40. Andy is the closest but he's absolutely miles away.

212
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:06,960
 It's 51.4. I think Glenke. The little moment illustrator. There's something interesting about him.

213
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:12,880
 He is similar to one of us. Oh he has something that one of us have.

214
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:23,120
 Really loves his wife. No it's not him. No it's something that one of you two have James and Anna.

215
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:31,120
 Oh okay. A bolt an accent. It's not Anna. A superior reticom plate.

216
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:41,920
 It's that he can't picture things in his mind's eye. He has an illustrator.

217
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,360
 He has a fantasia. Oh fantasia is another Disney film. Oh wow.

218
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,280
 Sorry. He is mind-blind as he calls it. It's not why he has to draw things because

219
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,240
 he can't see them in his mind so literally every time he thinks he has to draw it.

220
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:58,160
 No it's not but it makes it very difficult to draw things can I say. It was really hard because

221
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:03,120
 you can't imagine it before you put it on paper. So you start drawing stuff and then halfway

222
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,480
 free like this is nothing like what it's supposed to be. That's exactly right and he says

223
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,000
 the same thing. They're not drawing from memory they're creating so they have to scribble

224
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,200
 tweak until they have what they want. But he's one of the best animators ever. He's from the new

225
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,240
 golden age of animation. He drew the beast from beauty and the beast. So it can't be that hard James.

226
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,760
 I mean this guy's drawing the best drawing. Why haven't you already drawn?

227
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:34,880
 Can we talk about the little mermaid in Copenhagen? Sure thing. So there's a statue

228
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,760
 of the little mermaid in Copenhagen. Yeah. Which I think is one of the most suffering statues of

229
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,880
 all time. Right? So she's in the harbour. She's sitting on a rock. She's looking beautiful. She's

230
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,120
 washing her hair or something whatever. But she's Hans Christian Andersen's little mermaid because

231
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,120
 that's his original story which is very different. It's a bit more gruesome in the ending. It's

232
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:58,000
 not quite as disneyish but it's you know it's a classic fairy tale. Anyway this statue has been

233
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,680
 absolutely through the ring. Right? She was decapitated in 1964 and 1998. Her right arm was cut

234
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:09,440
 off in the 80s. She was partially decapitated in 1990. In 2003 she was blown up with dynamite.

235
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,200
 This statue has just had it that people have a go at this statue all the time.

236
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,240
 I think it's exciting. Oh just because she's so famous. She's such an icon.

237
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:21,520
 Well it's all sorts of reasons. So there was one group of radical feminists who claimed

238
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:27,360
 that they had done it to sort of point out to create a sim... they claimed their cut off of her head

239
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:32,000
 to create a symbol of the sexually fixated and male misogynist dream of women as being bodies without

240
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,440
 heads. I point well made I think. But didn't they then find that actually they'd known

241
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,360
 of evidence and they probably didn't do it. So they set a murder squad on the case that I love.

242
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,200
 Do you know they all like every single time she's been defaced? They get the murder squad.

243
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:52,560
 It's probably the same cut every time. But basically in 1990, an anonymous tip off guy rang up

244
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:56,960
 a TV cameraman, freelance TV cameraman called Michael Pulson and said go and check out the little

245
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,880
 man made's head. It's gone. Right. And he got to the scene of the crime and there were two people

246
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:07,280
 apparently roll skating away saying too late and then on day four the head turned up and it was

247
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:14,320
 returned by a masked figure to a TV station. And the return happened to be filmed by a freelance

248
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:19,520
 TV cameraman called Michael Pulson who was the one who got the original beheading scoop

249
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:25,760
 and he made lots of money selling both sets of shots and he was arrested as having maybe

250
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,240
 and done it himself. And did he get found LCR? He was released. He was questioned in them released so

251
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,840
 it wasn't him in the end. But it was thought that the whole thing would be done as kind of the

252
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:39,600
 thing to get some PR. But that wasn't it. No, I don't know if they got the 1991. Is it hard to

253
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:45,120
 decalitate a statue? Oh yeah. So that's a lot of out of bronze is hard to bronze is hard. Yeah,

254
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,200
 I'm surprised that they managed to do it because it seems to have been hacksawed off every time.

255
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,120
 Whenever I've been there, there's always a lot of tourists nearby so like you'd have to do in the

256
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,520
 middle of a night or something. Yeah. I think they do. Yeah. I think it was exciting for her.

257
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:03,440
 Because the biggest statue must be mostly so boring. There was an article in 2017 written in

258
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,640
 June and said literally by June of that year she'd already worn a burger, held a sex toy and been

259
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:15,920
 covered in paint twice. I mean, what a gig. Yeah. Unless you were racist as a statue, you'd see no action

260
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:20,960
 basically. But she's not, is she? She's not racist. No, no, no, but I'm just saying the only other

261
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:26,160
 statues that get hard to tell down. I don't know what people's motivation was, but probably when she

262
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:30,400
 was wearing a burger holding a sex toy, she was racist at that moment. No, I don't know, she was doing

263
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:36,080
 them both at the same time. I don't know if that makes it better. Is she complicit to those decisions?

264
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:42,320
 You know the Millennium dome? Yeah, man. Think of it from above, right? Yeah. What,

265
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,320
 what, how does it look? Circle. Like, yeah, like, what else does it feature?

266
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,960
 Some like, there's like some wires that go down to that, there's like a certain, yes, there's that.

267
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,240
 And you can actually walk over the top of it now. It's like a tourist thing you can do.

268
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,840
 There's a massive hole in the side of the Millennium dome that no one ever talks about.

269
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,880
 Okay. And what it is is, it's got a, it's a huge tower, like a ventilation tower for the

270
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,120
 black wall tunnel, which runs under London, and it needed to have a vent turn. No way.

271
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,320
 And they said, but that's where we want to build the Millennium dome. And they said, well, sorry,

272
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,520
 that's where our big tower is going. And it's just in the middle of the Millennium dome.

273
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,920
 And they convinced them by saying, don't worry, no one will notice. And she, as it turns out,

274
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,720
 you're the first person to know this. People will just not pay attention to it. Look at it,

275
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,920
 it's got a massive hole in the top. Don't know that. That's really weird. It's amazing. This

276
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:32,400
 building tunnel in Norway has a ventilation thing, doesn't it? Halfway through. We mentioned

277
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,160
 then the podcast a few weeks ago that you need to have these big fans and tunnels to make sure

278
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:41,840
 that the air goes through. Not just Andy standing in every tunnel. I'm a big fan.

279
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:49,440
 I'm very useless in actually ventilating the tunnel. But the one in Norway, it comes out

280
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,960
 in like the top of a mountain somewhere. I tried to find out on Google Maps and I could find

281
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:58,000
 the area, but I couldn't see the hole. Are you going to go there with a big cork? I was thinking,

282
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,440
 quite cool to go down there. I was thinking exactly the same thing. Well done. I'm going one step

283
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,840
 further. I think what a cool film or adventure to go in there and crawl all the way through.

284
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:14,240
 But when the Great Western Railway was built, there's quite a lot of tunnels there. And there's

285
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:21,040
 a guy called Dionysius Ladner who said, sorry, Dionysius Ladner. See, 2,000 years old. Victorian,

286
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:27,680
 Victorian. I mean, they knew how to name babies in those days. He said that if you put any train

287
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:32,560
 in a tunnel as long as, like, let's say the box tunnel, which is one of the big ones on the Great

288
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:37,280
 Western Railway, they said that the train would use up so much oxygen when it was moving that there

289
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:43,280
 wouldn't be anything for the passengers to breathe and then they would just die. He was saying that.

290
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:47,760
 He was saying that and he isn't right about those tunnels, but he is right that you do need a

291
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:54,160
 lot of insulation in those tunnels. Yeah, tough gig. That's amazing. I do have a tunnel that there's

292
00:26:54,160 --> 00:27:01,280
 a sort of railway legend about, which was, this was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. It was in

293
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:06,240
 the 19th century. It is the box tunnel near Bath. Do you know that tunnel? That's one I just

294
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:14,560
 mentioned. Oh, okay. Sorry. All right. So this was built with the idea that it was done deliberately

295
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:19,760
 so that light would shine from one end to the other through, right? It's like one of these big

296
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:24,880
 legends. At first, be on his birthday. It was meant to be on his birthday and the idea was not really

297
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:30,000
 confirmed until 200 years later when it was shut down and they were able to properly look through

298
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,120
 on a morning. I don't think it's been confirmed that it's for sure, like that was the reason.

299
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:40,560
 Oh, no, no, no. Exactly. But the legend that the sun would be seen on either side of the tunnel

300
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:45,440
 was a thing and that was done because it was said it was architecturally built so that it would do that

301
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:52,640
 on the birthday of Brunel and that was the 9th of April, which is today, the day that we over.

302
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:58,480
 We asked the railway company once if we could go and film it. Oh, really?

303
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,920
 For QI and they said, for some reason, they wouldn't stop the entire rail network just so we could

304
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:08,720
 go and film it. I mean, they stopped it a lot of the time, many way, for much worse reasons.

305
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,440
 Yeah, exactly. And is it that if you hold the prison in the right place, it shows you where the

306
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,600
 arc of the covenant is? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So we need to find it before the Nazis take us.

307
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:24,640
 This I'm just jumping back to this submarine that went around the world. It was a pretty amazing

308
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,760
 like the psychology of what do you do when you keep people for 60 days, which is roughly how long

309
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,320
 they were under. They had psychologists on board to monitor that and work out what was going on.

310
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,760
 They did things like make people quit smoking because everyone was smoking up until recently.

311
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:45,520
 It's only been banned smoking on submarines. So yeah, so they did days of testing psychologically.

312
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:50,080
 What does it do when you stop smoking? It did bad things. Everyone was really irritable.

313
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:57,200
 So they allowed them to start smoking again. They treated it a bit like a bit of a sightseeing tour,

314
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,200
 the whole of the trip. So anytime they got near land, the periscope would go up and everyone

315
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,720
 was allowed a turn of just having a look. So they got to Easter Island and everyone had a good old look.

316
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,840
 They pulled up to certain islands, whereas some of the members on board had family living there

317
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:16,800
 and asked them to out like locate the house on the shore. So one guy actually spotted his mum and

318
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:22,640
 dad's house through the periscope. And I think that's why this guy, this Filipino guy found them.

319
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:28,000
 Wasn't it? Because they take him the same route as Ferdinand McGellan did when he went around the

320
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 world. And at one stage, they saw that they were near like a statue of McGellan or something.

321
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,680
 And so they put the periscope up so everyone could see the statue. And that's where he was.

322
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:44,880
 There's one detail where his story wasn't believed or so we're told because this happened to

323
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,840
 have happened on April fulls day. And so when he came back and said, I saw a sea monster. I was like,

324
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,080
 okay, mate. Yeah, I sure think. Good day. You wouldn't believe it. You know, would you believe it

325
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,520
 every other day of the year? Someone comes to me and say they've seen a sea monster.

326
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:01,120
 There's like literally no day of the year except maybe Christmas is a present to them that I say,

327
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,680
 oh yeah, really cool. Yeah, probably April fulls day is the one day where you go, okay, well,

328
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:09,600
 that's just too obvious to be an April fulls day. It must be true. Yeah.

329
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:15,360
 The sentient island was an absolutely key part of the Falkland's War, wasn't it?

330
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:20,800
 They used this staging post. Yeah. Because that was one of the three. Those three islands aren't

331
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:28,640
 their sentient Tristidicunia. Tristidicunia. The UK took over sentient island when Napoleon was

332
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,880
 in St. Helena because they thought that they might use it. He might escape. Yeah.

333
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:38,560
 It's a very convenient only 2,000 mile away. Hopped to skip on a job to save Napoleon and we can't

334
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:46,880
 let it happen. It's not given that it's so remote. So many people visited it. For example,

335
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:53,040
 the guy who discovered it was a Portuguese called Hwanda Nova, who's known for some reason in St.

336
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:59,520
 Helena's John Newcastle. He was on his way to India and one of the crewmen on his voyage

337
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,800
 was a Marie-Govar Sputchi after whom America is named. Really?

338
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:08,720
 And then there's Captain Joshua Slocum, the first man to sail single-handed round the world,

339
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:14,560
 who dropped in there on 1898. He sailed the whole way around the world. You may have done this

340
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:17,680
 before without being able to swim, which is an extraordinary fact, isn't it?

341
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:22,480
 Well, I think it helps. It gives you more of an incentive to sail the world, do you think?

342
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,200
 Yeah, you're like, we've got to get back there because if we don't get there,

343
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,240
 I think a lot of sailors, you know, way back, deliberately didn't learn to swim because they

344
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,520
 didn't want to prolong the drowning. Oh, really?

345
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:39,360
 You'd rather have a quick one, yeah. One of the great forges of all time,

346
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:46,080
 El Mier de Hori. He was an artist himself, but he wasn't a very good one. He's kind of okay.

347
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:51,440
 But when he showed one of his paintings to them and called Lady Malcolm Campbell, she saw it.

348
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,800
 She said, "Oh, is that a Picasso?" And he was like, "No, no, it's me, and I can't really sell it,

349
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:01,200
 but Picasso seems to be selling quite well. So from now on, I'm just going to paint my stuff and

350
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:07,440
 pretend it's from a Picasso. Nice." And he became really massive. Throughout the forties, he was

351
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:14,560
 making all sorts of these forgeries of Picasso and Matisse. He created so many Medigliani forgeries

352
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:19,040
 that it's still now as impossible to compile a catalogue of Medigliani's work.

353
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:23,520
 That's a good idea. Yeah, because we don't know which ones are his and which ones are de Hori's.

354
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:30,640
 And his collection is run now. He was such a big forger that people want to see his paintings.

355
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:40,240
 And it's run by a guy called Mark Forgy. Really? Wow. On the attribution of, you know, who

356
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:47,440
 did what? A Nazi officer saw Gernica when Picasso was there. And he said, "Did you do that?"

357
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:54,560
 And Picasso said, "No, you did it." Nice. His only political painting, really.

358
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:59,280
 Really went office paintings during this because he was obsessed with himself and drawing his

359
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:03,440
 women and how tortured they were and what horrible time they were having because he was having affairs.

360
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:08,640
 And basically, he went out with Doormar, who was very political. She politicized him. He did

361
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:15,120
 Gernica. It became a huge anti-war symbol, didn't it? It was a painting of, there was a huge sort of,

362
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:21,600
 like, a craft bombing of a village in Spain during the Spanish Civil War, right? By the, by their

363
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:26,480
 allies of fascists here. By the Nazis and the Italians. Which was, in fact, a birthday present

364
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:35,280
 sweetly from Gering to Hitler. Sweet. So sweet. I just, I wonder what were the circumstances and the

365
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:41,840
 situation in which Picasso replied that to a Nazi? Was, were we talking post-war here? Are we talking,

366
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:47,920
 like, he wasn't in Nazi Germany, right? That's a pretty bold thing to say to a Nazi is all I'm saying.

367
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:53,120
 Well, presumably during the war, wasn't it during the Nazi war? Yeah, that's wild. What was the next

368
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:58,320
 sentence on the Nazi side? Because I think he was in Paris when the Nazis came into Paris, wasn't he?

369
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:06,880
 I think. Yes, and it reminds me of the famous story about Sigmund Freud when he was asked to,

370
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:15,280
 in order to get out of Germany under the Nazis, he was asked to sign a disclaimer saying that he

371
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:21,840
 hadn't been badly treated. And he wrote, "I can hardly recommend the Gestapo to anyone. This

372
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:30,480
 slightly overdo it." Do you know which National Anthem contains the word "moss"? This is a question

373
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:38,480
 for Andy really. Boss. Boss. Which word? Is it a biggie? Japan. And it's got it. Wow.

374
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:43,920
 Japan. They bloody love monsters. May your world go on for thousands of years until Pebbles merge into

375
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:49,600
 one giant rock and covered with moss. That's the dream. That's lovely. That's very good.

376
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:57,120
 In a National Anthem survey, 79% of Americans know the first line of the star-spangled banner,

377
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:04,000
 but only 37% of Canadians know the first line to O Canada, which is really pathetic considering

378
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 the first line of O Canada is O Canada. Can I just learn the fact? And, generally,

379
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,600
 terminates two, one best sound effects editing in 1992. And I think there was this famous moment where

380
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:24,480
 T-1000, who I believe is one of the characters, goes through some metal bars and the sound effect

381
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:29,280
 was achieved by pouring dog food out of a can. And it's quite cool to watch when you know that.

382
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:35,520
 But I didn't know the director of that had such a good money-saving cheat for two separate scenes

383
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:41,200
 where the terminator, or T-1000, I think can disguise himself as someone else. And so you see a

384
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,800
 character looking at their reflection and then that character turns around and the reflection

385
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,520
 still looking at them and you realise it's T-1000. Do you know how he achieves that effect

386
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:57,280
 with a window? I'll give you a clue if you've ever seen the film. Yes. It's the same concept as

387
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:02,160
 the big reveal in that. He used Arnold Schwarzenegger's twin. He used identical twins.

388
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:10,400
 He used identical twins twice in this film. There's identical twin,

389
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:16,240
 so those Don and Dan Stanton played a character called Lewis and then T-1000 returning to be him.

390
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,800
 And then Linda Hamilton, who I think was a famous part in that, had an identical twin called

391
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,200
 Leslie Hamilton. And whenever he needed one of them to do something body-double,

392
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,040
 isn't it? Was he hiring actors entirely based on- That's great, in that way.

393
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,920
 Yeah. So heads of Tate and cows,

394
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:37,760
 President Taft of America kept a cow called Pauline on the White House lawn. Do you remember that?

395
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:44,080
 I didn't remember it. No. So I was collecting names of, naming animals of odd names. So

396
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:53,280
 Byron had a pet wolf called Lion. Either reveal is bad, right? When you mean it. Yeah.

397
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:58,880
 Einstein had a cat called Tiger. Climps Gustav Clint had a cat called Catscaid, he said.

398
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:04,000
 And the Times journalist Andrew Billin, I read the other day, is called, he's got a cat called

399
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,040
 Vommy, which is Boad's ill, doesn't it? And I did that, I did really like this.

400
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:15,920
 Elgar, the composer, spent a lot of time with the heriford cathedral organist dog, who was called Dan.

401
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:23,040
 Anyway, when Dan fell into the river wine, swam upstream to find a landing place,

402
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:28,320
 somebody suggested that Elgar set the whole adventure to music. And he did, he said,

403
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:34,480
 have done it, it was called the Enigma Variation. No. Spired by Dan, the dog, and fell into the river.

404
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:40,720
 I think he's just replaced you as my favorite Dan. Oh, I thought that changed a long ago.

405
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:45,760
 Yeah. Nice. That's very cool. That's amazing. Whoever that journalist was, what a Billin,

406
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:54,320
 he got to share just then, out of nowhere. Taft. Andrew's a really good guy. Byron.

407
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:03,200
 What's Swindon Famous for? He's a very nice big ride for animals. Yeah, I could say about a football team.

408
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:08,640
 I thought they, what do they make him, Swindon? Diner doors is famous. He's a Swindon girl,

409
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:16,320
 and the mayor was introducing her once. He was terribly nervous because her maiden name was Diner

410
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:25,440
 Fluck, like Peter Fluck. And his head's a gentleman may introduce the lady used to be called

411
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:39,680
 Erlichlund. All right, there you go. That is all of our outtakes. If you want to write to any of us

412
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:45,280
 about the things that were said in this episode, podcast@ky.com, all those emails go to Andy,

413
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,360
 he goes through them, and some of them make their way to drop us a line of which there'll be another

414
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:55,200
 episode popping into your clubfish feed in the next couple of weeks. So do write in. If you want

415
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:00,960
 to have yours read out on the show, one correction from the outtakes, which we thought worth keeping in

416
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,520
 anyway, sometimes we just tell stories out loud because someone has said something while we're on

417
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:11,600
 a tangent. And I just wanted to add a few corrections that brilliantly funny Steve Martin's story

418
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:17,600
 that I told earlier. So just in case you think in, can't wait for this episode to end, I absolutely

419
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:21,760
 want to get out there and start spreading this story. There's a few corrections to add about it.

420
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:28,640
 One is that he was filming Roxanne and he did go into a bar. However, it wasn't because it was the

421
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:32,320
 end of the day and he was looking for a drink because they were halfway through the filming day.

422
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,560
 He had the prosthetics on. He really needed the bathroom. There wasn't one around. Someone pointed

423
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:42,320
 him to that place. He walked in and then the story's pretty much the same. He gets looks from all the

424
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:47,280
 locals. He's thinking, "Ooh, am I welcome here or not?" And a man walks up to him, looks him up and

425
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:53,040
 down and says, "Why the long face?" There you go. You can now go out into the wild and spread that hilarious

426
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:58,080
 story. Alright, that is it everyone. We are going to be back as I say with the droppers of line in

427
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:02,640
 a couple of weeks. We will see you all then and hopefully some of you in Sheffield. No such thing

428
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:07,040
 as a fish.com. Check that out and find yourself some tickets. Alright guys, take care. Hope you all

429
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:19,200
 doing well. We'll speak to you soon. Goodbye.

430
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,260
 you
