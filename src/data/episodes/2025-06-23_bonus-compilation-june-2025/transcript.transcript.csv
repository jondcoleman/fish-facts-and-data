00:00:00,00:00:06,Howdy club fish members. How you doing? Down here. We have a compilation episode for you today.
00:00:06,00:00:11,"This is the best bits of the stuff that didn't make it into the main episodes, little outtakes,"
00:00:11,00:00:17,little extra bits of info that didn't quite fit the narrative of the show or bung together here
00:00:17,00:00:24,"for you, starring the four fishers plus John Lloyd, the QI Supremo. So I hope you enjoy that."
00:00:24,00:00:29,"This should be hitting the club fish page on Tuesday, which means we're just under two weeks"
00:00:29,00:00:36,"away from doing our next live show, which is happening in Sheffield at the Crossed wires festival,"
00:00:36,00:00:40,"which is going to say that if you are thinking of coming, we are on the edge of selling out,"
00:00:40,00:00:44,"and so don't leave it to last minute, because there might not be any tickets left."
00:00:44,00:00:49,You can find them again in no such thing as a fish.com. It can be really fun night. I think the show is
00:00:49,00:00:55,about 85 minutes. We're going to be doing really fun things like we're going to enter someone
00:00:55,00:01:01,"into the fish Hall of Fame, a local from Sheffield, who has been mentioned previously on the episode,"
00:01:01,00:01:05,"so they'll be up on stage with us, or at least that's the plan. We might try out something new"
00:01:05,00:01:10,"altogether. It's always fun doing these live shows, and we'd love to see you there. So come along,"
00:01:10,00:01:13,"but for now, enjoy the compilation episode. Here we go."
00:01:14,00:01:33,"I had a quick hunt, by the way, because Marie's plums. Nice to have something named after you,"
00:01:33,00:01:40,"Andy. I wanted to see if we had any other fruits that were relevant to us, the other three of us."
00:01:40,00:01:54,So I found Harkin Peaches. I was just reading up to see if there were any similarities. So I found
00:01:54,00:02:01,"someone who actually farms them, and they say that normally Harkin trees are pretty finicky producers."
00:02:01,00:02:07,I'm a finicky producer when it comes to TV production. You're covered in a lovely soft fuzz.
00:02:07,00:02:19,"You don't have a Toshinsky, but you have an Anna, which is Anna's apple, which is Anna Bowlin's."
00:02:19,00:02:29,"After all, Anna Bowlin. I'm not sure. That's not make assumptions. That's a leap. That's a leap."
00:02:29,00:02:35,"Maybe they've got her head. Well, in some of the photos, it is quite a flat apple. They didn't take"
00:02:35,00:02:43,"photos at the time. What? Oh, right, of the apple. Is it? In some photos, there's different shapes to it,"
00:02:43,00:02:48,"so yeah, I got excited. I've been to two of Ambulin's homes in the last month. Ambulin's following me"
00:02:48,00:02:56,"around at the moment. No, you're following her around. These other detectors, like the weird"
00:02:56,00:02:59,"ways people have tried to detect neutrinos, because lots of countries have got their own ones"
00:02:59,00:03:05,"around the place. So there's one in Japan, which is a tank of 50,000 tonnes of ultra-pure water"
00:03:05,00:03:10,under a mountain. That's called the super cameo candy. And scientists have to get rafts around the
00:03:10,00:03:15,surface of this. What on the ultra-pure water? They were around on it. I shot that clean the raft
00:03:15,00:03:20,"before they go in. They probably have one of those little, you know, a little puddle of clean water"
00:03:20,00:03:23,"that you walk through so that you don't get varuchas. Yeah, definitely. And they'll have a pool robot"
00:03:23,00:03:29,"on the inside, just getting anything else. They're just a guy with his top off at a long net."
00:03:29,00:03:38,"Then the first detector built in the 60s by Raymond Davis, Jr. and John Buckle was a tank"
00:03:38,00:03:44,"with half a million litres of dry cleaning fluid in it. Oh, yeah. What? Yeah, it has more uses, I guess."
00:03:44,00:03:48,"Dry cleaning fluid? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I actually don't know if I know what dry, you mean,"
00:03:48,00:03:54,"like washing fluid? No, it's a chemical you use, isn't it? I can't remember what it's called now."
00:03:54,00:03:58,"Never been to dry cleaners. Wouldn't know. But, cool. Glad it's got another even better application."
00:03:58,00:04:03,"Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, yeah. That's really cool. And there's one called Dune in America."
00:04:03,00:04:10,"It's two. It's underground. It is underground, like the worms, but there are two detectors,"
00:04:10,00:04:16,"800 miles apart. One is pointing at the other one. You know, plums have stones in them."
00:04:17,00:04:22,"They're unique to the species that stone. You know all the, like, the little bumps and stuff"
00:04:22,00:04:26,that you get. Like a fingerprint? Like a fingerprint. So you know which plum is burgled you?
00:04:26,00:04:33,"What do you mean you need to the species? Sorry. So if you get a little plum stone, it's got loads"
00:04:33,00:04:39,of wrinkles on it. And you have a buck which has all the different patterns. You'll be able to tell
00:04:39,00:04:44,"which species a plum it comes from or which variety. Wow, it matches the same dense in the"
00:04:44,00:04:51,"stone. Yeah, yeah, exactly. And so in the Murray Rose ship, oh, we sang when 16th century,"
00:04:51,00:04:59,"and then they raised it in 20th century. They found all these stones, all these plum stones,"
00:04:59,00:05:03,and they could tell exactly what species they were. And they went or what variety they were.
00:05:03,00:05:08,"And they went back to the National Fruit Centre, which I think we might have mentioned before."
00:05:08,00:05:12,Yes. And checked it against modern fruits. And they could see exactly what they were.
00:05:12,00:05:19,"Oh my goodness. That's insane. So actually they share fingerprints. So if you're one species of plum,"
00:05:19,00:05:23,then you can blame the burglary on your mate who's the same species because you've left the same
00:05:23,00:05:27,print. It's almost like every family would have the same or something like that. That's a nice
00:05:27,00:05:37,"time. Yeah. Every time. Professor plum. Yeah. So plum's blue gold, they're called in Serbia."
00:05:39,00:05:44,"They have 40 million plum trees, and at least three plum festivals every year in Serbia."
00:05:44,00:05:47,"Brilliant. And if you have Schlippervitz,"
00:05:47,00:05:54,"Serbian drink, the National Drink, then that's plum flavoured usually."
00:05:54,00:05:59,Oh god. Is that the thing they give you at the end of every meal whenever you go to one of those
00:05:59,00:06:06,"countries? Yeah. If you're in like Serbia, Montenegro, some parts of Bosnia, and they give you that,"
00:06:06,00:06:10,"have it, because if you don't, you're insulting them, but you're going to regret it the next day."
00:06:10,00:06:14,Is it like all of those things where it claims to be flavoured with expert tastes like petrol?
00:06:14,00:06:18,"Yeah, it tastes really strong. It's not quite chemical. There's often a thing where..."
00:06:18,00:06:23,"I don't know if this is your experience, but where if you're there with someone of the opposite sex,"
00:06:23,00:06:29,"so in my experience, my wife would be given a reasonably nice spirit, and I would be given something"
00:06:29,00:06:34,that was absolutely lighter flowing. It's a slightly blocier thing to get. And she's got a
00:06:34,00:06:39,"little bit of plum brandy or something and I'm just drinking pure diesel. I must admit,"
00:06:39,00:06:45,"whenever I've been with Serbians and the, um, Schlippervitz has come out, usually everyone's getting"
00:06:45,00:06:49,"involved. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I've never had that experience. They must think of you as"
00:06:49,00:06:55,particularly manly. What they've seen my plums see there.
00:06:55,00:07:04,"The venison general, I didn't know how it's built, so I knew it was lagoonie. I knew it's in the"
00:07:04,00:07:10,"middle of a lagoon. There wasn't a road or rail link until the middle of the 19th century,"
00:07:10,00:07:17,but it was built. What I didn't know is that it is how it's on stills. So every building is built on
00:07:17,00:07:22,"these wooden poles, which have been driven down into the sediment. And if you drive down"
00:07:22,00:07:27,"enough poles, it's like 9 or 10 per square meter. You can just put stone on top of that and it all"
00:07:28,00:07:36,"appears. So the Church of San Marco required 10,000 oak trees to be converted into poles."
00:07:36,00:07:41,"For one church. For one church, it's a big church. The whole of Venice must be way even more than that."
00:07:41,00:07:47,It's millions. Millions and millions of these poles. It's like it's an inverted forest. It's so cool.
00:07:47,00:07:51,"And this was literally 1500 years ago, wasn't it? I mean, this is in the 5th century or whatever,"
00:07:51,00:07:56,which is extraordinary that they were able to do that. I think and the good thing is because they're
00:07:56,00:08:02,"underwater and they're all underwater, right? So you've got the rocks on top, but the poles themselves"
00:08:02,00:08:06,never go above the water. And that means they don't rot because there's no oxygen to make them
00:08:06,00:08:12,rock. So they stay on the water and they're still now. The ones from 1500 years ago are still good.
00:08:12,00:08:17,"They're not kind of falling apart. It's amazing. And there was a drum, the batty pally, the pile hitters."
00:08:17,00:08:23,"That was their job was to pound the piles into the ground. You need a big hammer for that, don't you?"
00:08:23,00:08:28,How are you doing that? What do you do? I didn't often work experience on a farm once and I had to.
00:08:28,00:08:34,"When you're building a fence, you have this big metal drum which is open at one end and it's got two"
00:08:34,00:08:38,"handles. It's like a milk churn, basically, but you put it upside down. You put it over the stake."
00:08:38,00:08:42,"You're banging into the ground, the stake banging, and you just lift it up and bang down it goes."
00:08:42,00:08:46,"It's such a hard work. But in water, that must be really difficult. Oh, with a whole sort of tree,"
00:08:46,00:08:50,"you basically, you've got to be so strong. You've got to be so strong. Yeah, and they had their"
00:08:50,00:08:55,"traditional song, which was all about Venice and its glory and death to the Turks, like good"
00:08:55,00:09:00,"traditional stuff. And even now in Venice, there's a phrase ""na testa de baté pay"" which means"
00:09:00,00:09:04,"a head that is good to pound down the piles. Are you a bit thick? You know, you're going to head to"
00:09:04,00:09:08,useful for banging it. And now we're going to talk about why you only lasted an afternoon of work
00:09:08,00:09:13,"experience on that farm. Yeah, I've been slated for a seven-year contract of stake banging,"
00:09:13,00:09:21,"but I got tired. It's really hard work. You know George Foreman's Grill, most famous grill of all"
00:09:21,00:09:26,"time. It's shifted like over 100 million units. Is it a barbecue? No, no, it's like a grill."
00:09:26,00:09:32,"You sort of, you host your maker. It looks exactly like one, but it's for meat. And it's positioned"
00:09:32,00:09:39,"on an angle so that all of the juices sort of run down and away. And he's made more, he made,"
00:09:39,00:09:44,"because he's passed away now, more money off the back of that than his entire boxing career by"
00:09:44,00:09:48,"subestantial amount. He's made like between 200 and 500 million off of it, because he was getting 40%"
00:09:48,00:09:53,"of the deal. But most people mistook him as the creator of it. But in fact, it was this brilliant"
00:09:53,00:09:59,"innovator who was called Michael Bohm, who was the person who started it. He went to George Foreman"
00:09:59,00:10:05,"and Hulk Hogan to say which one of you could do it, or he went to the same agent who had both of"
00:10:05,00:10:10,"them. Foreman got it in the end. But this guy, no one believed him that he invented it. So he used to"
00:10:10,00:10:16,"walk around with the patent on him any time that someone said, you're not the inventor. He was a,"
00:10:16,00:10:19,am I not? Have a look at my patent. Not talking to him at a party. That's what that's like.
00:10:19,00:10:26,"He's a t-shirt saying, I invented the George Foreman Grill is deterring me. And the arm is not talking to"
00:10:26,00:10:31,"you at a party, but a serious trouble. Yeah, Mitterrand, Francois Mitterrand, isn't it?"
00:10:31,00:10:37,"The reason one. Yeah, very recent. He had a wife, but he also had a mistress in the dark. He"
00:10:37,00:10:42,"basically lived a double life. And it was his wife, Danielle, who insisted that it was kept secret"
00:10:42,00:10:48,"from the press. And basically, the press all knew about it, but they like decided they wouldn't"
00:10:48,00:10:54,"print anything. France, they're ultra conservative about exposing their leaders. They really are."
00:10:54,00:10:59,"They're very, very cautious about it. I suppose it's weird because they're conservative about"
00:10:59,00:11:04,"that, but they are much more liberal as we famously know about relationships. So Mitterrand's situation"
00:11:04,00:11:10,"was so interesting. Before he became president, he lived in a house with his wife and his wife's"
00:11:10,00:11:16,"lover, who had just had a separate room in their house. And when he became president, Dan don't"
00:11:16,00:11:21,"think about it. I thought he struck you there, though, to make that noise. But when he did become"
00:11:21,00:11:25,"president, they like his staff moved to the woman Anne, who he was having this affair with,"
00:11:25,00:11:30,"into a house, it was nice and near him. So he could go through all the time. And they employed a guy"
00:11:30,00:11:36,"to make sure that no one printed anything about them. So there was this guy called Grand Swad,"
00:11:36,00:11:41,"The Grosse of, and whenever any journalist sort of sniffed around, they said, we're going to do an"
00:11:41,00:11:45,"article about this separate life you have. At one stage, they got a journalist and kidnapped him"
00:11:45,00:11:51,"and locked him in the cell for a week, saying, oh my god. And then it's like it's a bigger story."
00:11:52,00:11:56,"And then in 2021, it turned out that he wasn't living a double life. After all, he was living a triple"
00:11:56,00:12:02,"life. And there was another woman called Claire, who was 50 years his junior, who that he was having"
00:12:02,00:12:07,"affair with the whole time as well. I actually think he was having lots of shags along the way. But yeah,"
00:12:07,00:12:13,"Claire again, it was so interesting. It was just like very different standards that I can't judge."
00:12:13,00:12:20,"So she Claire had followed him for four years, when she was 18 to 22. And then eventually invited"
00:12:20,00:12:24,him around her house. And they had basically what seems like quite a nice relationship for the last
00:12:24,00:12:31,10 years of his life alongside his marriage. It's one interpretation. And then people could say that
00:12:31,00:12:35,"it was an appropriate. Yeah, you could say that there's a massive massive power imbalance."
00:12:35,00:12:39,"You could say that. Yes, although she's definitely more physically able. And the staff all said it"
00:12:39,00:12:44,"was great because she could go on official visits with him and because she was so young, even in"
00:12:44,00:12:49,"France, no one suspected that they were together. So she used to accompany him. Brilliant. In many"
00:12:49,00:12:59,"ways, the perfect crime. I want to stress the word cry. Yeah. But all of this stuff about method"
00:12:59,00:13:06,"acting for method. I love. It's about to Stanislavsky does. Yes. Russian, Russian acting coach."
00:13:06,00:13:12,Yeah. Constantin Stanislavsky. And he founded this realistic acting stuff. And all acting was
00:13:12,00:13:17,very unrealistic on film because it was silent film. So you have to have big theatrical gestures
00:13:17,00:13:22,and movements and theater as well. Exactly. And then it all changed as when the close-up is
00:13:22,00:13:28,"invented. Suddenly you zoom right in on someone's face and they're going, they look like they're"
00:13:28,00:13:34,overacting crazily. And so then you could do the less is more school. But then Stanislavsky
00:13:34,00:13:39,founded this sort of realistic acting stuff. Yeah. And you would go in and you'd be an actor in
00:13:39,00:13:45,"Stanislavsky's Moscow theatre. And you would do your lines and he would just go, I don't believe you."
00:13:45,00:13:49,"And you do them again. He go, I don't believe you. I don't believe you. I don't believe you. And you"
00:13:49,00:13:53,just say that again and again and again until it was right. That was genuinely giving me a flashback
00:13:53,00:13:58,to my clown school days. It's horrible. It's horrible when someone hates what you're doing and they
00:13:58,00:14:03,"and they won't let you go. But Stanislavsky in fairness, he walked the walk. So he did that method"
00:14:03,00:14:09,himself and whenever he was acting apart he would go for a walk in Yalta. Like he had a big sort of theatre
00:14:09,00:14:14,in Crimea and he would go for a walk in his character every single morning. Everyone would laugh at him
00:14:14,00:14:17,and point at him but he didn't really mind because he was just trying to get into character.
00:14:17,00:14:23,I really respect the lack of social fear that you have to have to do. Like Daniel Day-Lewis
00:14:23,00:14:27,just having the guts to do it. And I really like the fact I thought he was a bit of a dick for doing
00:14:27,00:14:31,it but then you read interviews and he said he does it for fun which I can really empathise with.
00:14:31,00:14:35,It's like he says I do it to play. Also it's the director saying yeah we'll pay for you to
00:14:35,00:14:42,like live in Prague and learn Czech. But do you know the famous story and the great story about
00:14:42,00:14:46,"method acting? I found something out about that. You know the Dustin Hoffman,"
00:14:46,00:14:50,Lawrence Olivier Tail which is that when they were filming Marathon Man with Dustin Hoffman
00:14:50,00:14:56,in the 80s was it and Dustin Hoffman stagged in one day and there's one bit of Marathon Man
00:14:56,00:15:00,where the lead character that Dustin Hoffman's playing has to have been awake for three days straight
00:15:00,00:15:07,and he stagged in and says to Lawrence Olivier I stayed awake for three days preparing for this
00:15:07,00:15:11,character. I feel like absolute shit and he's haggin in his hairs all over the place and Lawrence
00:15:11,00:15:16,Olivier just turned him put his hand on his shoulder and said my dear why don't you try acting?
00:15:16,00:15:24,Anyway famous story. Dustin Hoffman has said he wasn't actually doing it to prepare. He'd just been
00:15:24,00:15:29,out on the booze for three nights straight. And I think maybe he's trying to sound cool now
00:15:29,00:15:33,because he said he comes across as the loser in that story. As Lawrence Olivier is the aloof.
00:15:33,00:15:39,It was also dead so there's no you can't come back and say he's lying. He's lying. Exactly. I love
00:15:39,00:15:44,there's a story which is sort of method acting. Steve Martin when he did Roxanne the movie he has a
00:15:44,00:15:48,giant nose right Pinocchio long. They were in a small town and they were filming and he finished a
00:15:48,00:15:52,day and really needed a drink so it takes a long time to take the prosthetic off so he's like I'm
00:15:52,00:15:57,just going for a drink. But then he sort of got cold feet while he was out and I've got this giant
00:15:57,00:16:02,nose. I'm going to walk into a bar. No one knows really who I am out here and he gets into a bar
00:16:02,00:16:08,and it does the classic piano stops playing. Everyone turns around and he's freaking out thinking oh
00:16:08,00:16:13,go what am I doing? I'm going to get my ass kicked walks up to the bar and I grew some looking dude
00:16:13,00:16:20,according to him walks up to him and says hey why the long face. Beautiful. Come on. Great
00:16:20,00:16:28,a story I've ever heard. Love. He's better on paper. Avant de Gaulle. She's an interesting character.
00:16:28,00:16:34,Charles de Gaulle's wife. Exactly. Yeah so she was the first lady of France and she there was a story
00:16:34,00:16:40,that while sort of his retirement was imminent she was at Buckingham Palace and I guess asked her
00:16:40,00:16:46,what are you most looking forward to in your retirement. She said a penis. I mean it's almost the
00:16:46,00:16:53,origin of that joke. She was saying happiness but it was oh god and then Steve Martin walked in
00:16:53,00:17:02,and she's just on my jokes. It's your fault. History's jokes. But yeah she's a very interesting
00:17:02,00:17:07,character. While we're talking about censorship as the top bit of this fact she was very much
00:17:07,00:17:11,against things like displays of nudity and sex and tried to have things pass so that they wouldn't
00:17:11,00:17:16,be shown in public. Many skirts were a problem for her as well. She wanted the lengthening of a skirt
00:17:16,00:17:22,to have to actually be legally asserted in length and then there's this amazing thing. You know there
00:17:22,00:17:26,was an assassination attempt on on shot. Oh well there was one of both of them. I mean he was one of
00:17:26,00:17:31,the most almost as opposed to better history. So 1962 they get ambushed while they're in their car
00:17:31,00:17:36,and it's machine gun fire. They both survive her first words after she got out of the car were
00:17:36,00:17:50,a penis. Please cut out the earlier efforts. I think I'll really. A first question was how were
00:17:50,00:17:56,my chickens? And it's because she just bought some chickens in jelly at some fair at some
00:17:56,00:18:04,floor. That still was more concerned to her. That machine gun bullets might have absolutely
00:18:04,00:18:08,proliterated them. But they're in the car. They're in the boot the car. Yeah. God what could have
00:18:08,00:18:11,happened? Like even if you're chicken get shot by a bullet. Maybe they're red chickens that you
00:18:11,00:18:16,only get at that one fair once a year. You know I get it. Okay. Fair enough. I'll be your question too.
00:18:16,00:18:26,The cockle van. More like cockle boot. Coggo van with a name. There you go. Yes. There's a joke in
00:18:26,00:18:32,that somewhere. Absolutely. Mongolia barbecue is quite cool. It's called boo dog. What you do is
00:18:32,00:18:38,you take your. You frighten a dog. It leaps into the fire and then pops your uncle. I think if
00:18:38,00:18:42,you told the dog about this they get frightened. So you get your animal. Let's say it's a mammoth.
00:18:42,00:18:48,You cut it open from its head to its groin. Slice it right down. You take out all the insides.
00:18:48,00:18:54,You season them and then you stuff them back in again with stones and veggies and you put it over a
00:18:54,00:18:59,fire and you just leave it over the fire for ages and ages and then you bring it out and you
00:18:59,00:19:04,eat all the insides and the stones are now really really hot and you pass them around the group.
00:19:04,00:19:09,Everyone gets to hold the stones in their hand. Why? Well I was going to ask you that.
00:19:09,00:19:16,Why would you want to do that? It gets quite cold in Mongolia I guess. It does at times.
00:19:16,00:19:20,Yeah. It's warmer this way. This is supposed to move. Put on your hand. It's like a hot plate.
00:19:20,00:19:24,It just keeps it a bit warm. Oh yeah. Good call. Apparently it's supposed to help against stress.
00:19:25,00:19:32,Okay. Hold it in very hot stones. I feel stressed. How fast is the fastest submarine?
00:19:32,00:19:40,Ooh I bet you can give it in. Give it an MPH if you want. This is the underwater sea record.
00:19:40,00:19:46,Also 50. Oh really? I've had some 50 miles an hour for it. I was going to say 200.
00:19:46,00:19:50,I'm so less. There's a lot of water resistance in there and they're so big and fat.
00:19:50,00:19:57,I'm going to say 30. No that's mad. 40. Andy is the closest but he's absolutely miles away.
00:19:57,00:20:06,It's 51.4. I think Glenke. The little moment illustrator. There's something interesting about him.
00:20:06,00:20:12,He is similar to one of us. Oh he has something that one of us have.
00:20:12,00:20:23,Really loves his wife. No it's not him. No it's something that one of you two have James and Anna.
00:20:23,00:20:31,Oh okay. A bolt an accent. It's not Anna. A superior reticom plate.
00:20:31,00:20:41,It's that he can't picture things in his mind's eye. He has an illustrator.
00:20:41,00:20:45,He has a fantasia. Oh fantasia is another Disney film. Oh wow.
00:20:45,00:20:49,Sorry. He is mind-blind as he calls it. It's not why he has to draw things because
00:20:49,00:20:52,he can't see them in his mind so literally every time he thinks he has to draw it.
00:20:52,00:20:58,No it's not but it makes it very difficult to draw things can I say. It was really hard because
00:20:58,00:21:03,you can't imagine it before you put it on paper. So you start drawing stuff and then halfway
00:21:03,00:21:06,free like this is nothing like what it's supposed to be. That's exactly right and he says
00:21:06,00:21:10,the same thing. They're not drawing from memory they're creating so they have to scribble
00:21:10,00:21:15,tweak until they have what they want. But he's one of the best animators ever. He's from the new
00:21:15,00:21:20,golden age of animation. He drew the beast from beauty and the beast. So it can't be that hard James.
00:21:20,00:21:25,I mean this guy's drawing the best drawing. Why haven't you already drawn?
00:21:25,00:21:34,Can we talk about the little mermaid in Copenhagen? Sure thing. So there's a statue
00:21:34,00:21:39,of the little mermaid in Copenhagen. Yeah. Which I think is one of the most suffering statues of
00:21:39,00:21:44,all time. Right? So she's in the harbour. She's sitting on a rock. She's looking beautiful. She's
00:21:44,00:21:49,washing her hair or something whatever. But she's Hans Christian Andersen's little mermaid because
00:21:49,00:21:53,that's his original story which is very different. It's a bit more gruesome in the ending. It's
00:21:53,00:21:58,not quite as disneyish but it's you know it's a classic fairy tale. Anyway this statue has been
00:21:58,00:22:03,absolutely through the ring. Right? She was decapitated in 1964 and 1998. Her right arm was cut
00:22:03,00:22:09,off in the 80s. She was partially decapitated in 1990. In 2003 she was blown up with dynamite.
00:22:09,00:22:13,This statue has just had it that people have a go at this statue all the time.
00:22:13,00:22:16,I think it's exciting. Oh just because she's so famous. She's such an icon.
00:22:16,00:22:21,Well it's all sorts of reasons. So there was one group of radical feminists who claimed
00:22:21,00:22:27,that they had done it to sort of point out to create a sim... they claimed their cut off of her head
00:22:27,00:22:32,to create a symbol of the sexually fixated and male misogynist dream of women as being bodies without
00:22:32,00:22:37,heads. I point well made I think. But didn't they then find that actually they'd known
00:22:37,00:22:41,of evidence and they probably didn't do it. So they set a murder squad on the case that I love.
00:22:41,00:22:45,Do you know they all like every single time she's been defaced? They get the murder squad.
00:22:45,00:22:52,"It's probably the same cut every time. But basically in 1990, an anonymous tip off guy rang up"
00:22:52,00:22:56,"a TV cameraman, freelance TV cameraman called Michael Pulson and said go and check out the little"
00:22:56,00:23:00,man made's head. It's gone. Right. And he got to the scene of the crime and there were two people
00:23:00,00:23:07,apparently roll skating away saying too late and then on day four the head turned up and it was
00:23:07,00:23:14,returned by a masked figure to a TV station. And the return happened to be filmed by a freelance
00:23:14,00:23:19,TV cameraman called Michael Pulson who was the one who got the original beheading scoop
00:23:19,00:23:25,and he made lots of money selling both sets of shots and he was arrested as having maybe
00:23:25,00:23:30,and done it himself. And did he get found LCR? He was released. He was questioned in them released so
00:23:30,00:23:33,it wasn't him in the end. But it was thought that the whole thing would be done as kind of the
00:23:33,00:23:39,"thing to get some PR. But that wasn't it. No, I don't know if they got the 1991. Is it hard to"
00:23:39,00:23:45,"decalitate a statue? Oh yeah. So that's a lot of out of bronze is hard to bronze is hard. Yeah,"
00:23:45,00:23:49,I'm surprised that they managed to do it because it seems to have been hacksawed off every time.
00:23:49,00:23:53,"Whenever I've been there, there's always a lot of tourists nearby so like you'd have to do in the"
00:23:53,00:23:57,middle of a night or something. Yeah. I think they do. Yeah. I think it was exciting for her.
00:23:57,00:24:03,Because the biggest statue must be mostly so boring. There was an article in 2017 written in
00:24:03,00:24:08,"June and said literally by June of that year she'd already worn a burger, held a sex toy and been"
00:24:08,00:24:15,"covered in paint twice. I mean, what a gig. Yeah. Unless you were racist as a statue, you'd see no action"
00:24:15,00:24:20,"basically. But she's not, is she? She's not racist. No, no, no, but I'm just saying the only other"
00:24:20,00:24:26,"statues that get hard to tell down. I don't know what people's motivation was, but probably when she"
00:24:26,00:24:30,"was wearing a burger holding a sex toy, she was racist at that moment. No, I don't know, she was doing"
00:24:30,00:24:36,them both at the same time. I don't know if that makes it better. Is she complicit to those decisions?
00:24:36,00:24:42,"You know the Millennium dome? Yeah, man. Think of it from above, right? Yeah. What,"
00:24:42,00:24:46,"what, how does it look? Circle. Like, yeah, like, what else does it feature?"
00:24:46,00:24:50,"Some like, there's like some wires that go down to that, there's like a certain, yes, there's that."
00:24:50,00:24:54,And you can actually walk over the top of it now. It's like a tourist thing you can do.
00:24:54,00:24:59,There's a massive hole in the side of the Millennium dome that no one ever talks about.
00:24:59,00:25:04,"Okay. And what it is is, it's got a, it's a huge tower, like a ventilation tower for the"
00:25:04,00:25:09,"black wall tunnel, which runs under London, and it needed to have a vent turn. No way."
00:25:09,00:25:12,"And they said, but that's where we want to build the Millennium dome. And they said, well, sorry,"
00:25:12,00:25:15,that's where our big tower is going. And it's just in the middle of the Millennium dome.
00:25:15,00:25:19,"And they convinced them by saying, don't worry, no one will notice. And she, as it turns out,"
00:25:19,00:25:22,"you're the first person to know this. People will just not pay attention to it. Look at it,"
00:25:22,00:25:25,it's got a massive hole in the top. Don't know that. That's really weird. It's amazing. This
00:25:25,00:25:32,"building tunnel in Norway has a ventilation thing, doesn't it? Halfway through. We mentioned"
00:25:32,00:25:36,then the podcast a few weeks ago that you need to have these big fans and tunnels to make sure
00:25:36,00:25:41,that the air goes through. Not just Andy standing in every tunnel. I'm a big fan.
00:25:41,00:25:49,"I'm very useless in actually ventilating the tunnel. But the one in Norway, it comes out"
00:25:49,00:25:52,in like the top of a mountain somewhere. I tried to find out on Google Maps and I could find
00:25:52,00:25:58,"the area, but I couldn't see the hole. Are you going to go there with a big cork? I was thinking,"
00:25:58,00:26:03,quite cool to go down there. I was thinking exactly the same thing. Well done. I'm going one step
00:26:03,00:26:07,further. I think what a cool film or adventure to go in there and crawl all the way through.
00:26:07,00:26:14,"But when the Great Western Railway was built, there's quite a lot of tunnels there. And there's"
00:26:14,00:26:21,"a guy called Dionysius Ladner who said, sorry, Dionysius Ladner. See, 2,000 years old. Victorian,"
00:26:21,00:26:27,"Victorian. I mean, they knew how to name babies in those days. He said that if you put any train"
00:26:27,00:26:32,"in a tunnel as long as, like, let's say the box tunnel, which is one of the big ones on the Great"
00:26:32,00:26:37,"Western Railway, they said that the train would use up so much oxygen when it was moving that there"
00:26:37,00:26:43,wouldn't be anything for the passengers to breathe and then they would just die. He was saying that.
00:26:43,00:26:47,"He was saying that and he isn't right about those tunnels, but he is right that you do need a"
00:26:47,00:26:54,"lot of insulation in those tunnels. Yeah, tough gig. That's amazing. I do have a tunnel that there's"
00:26:54,00:27:01,"a sort of railway legend about, which was, this was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. It was in"
00:27:01,00:27:06,the 19th century. It is the box tunnel near Bath. Do you know that tunnel? That's one I just
00:27:06,00:27:14,"mentioned. Oh, okay. Sorry. All right. So this was built with the idea that it was done deliberately"
00:27:14,00:27:19,"so that light would shine from one end to the other through, right? It's like one of these big"
00:27:19,00:27:24,"legends. At first, be on his birthday. It was meant to be on his birthday and the idea was not really"
00:27:24,00:27:30,confirmed until 200 years later when it was shut down and they were able to properly look through
00:27:30,00:27:35,"on a morning. I don't think it's been confirmed that it's for sure, like that was the reason."
00:27:35,00:27:40,"Oh, no, no, no. Exactly. But the legend that the sun would be seen on either side of the tunnel"
00:27:40,00:27:45,was a thing and that was done because it was said it was architecturally built so that it would do that
00:27:45,00:27:52,"on the birthday of Brunel and that was the 9th of April, which is today, the day that we over."
00:27:52,00:27:58,"We asked the railway company once if we could go and film it. Oh, really?"
00:27:58,00:28:03,"For QI and they said, for some reason, they wouldn't stop the entire rail network just so we could"
00:28:03,00:28:08,"go and film it. I mean, they stopped it a lot of the time, many way, for much worse reasons."
00:28:08,00:28:13,"Yeah, exactly. And is it that if you hold the prison in the right place, it shows you where the"
00:28:13,00:28:17,arc of the covenant is? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So we need to find it before the Nazis take us.
00:28:17,00:28:24,This I'm just jumping back to this submarine that went around the world. It was a pretty amazing
00:28:24,00:28:29,"like the psychology of what do you do when you keep people for 60 days, which is roughly how long"
00:28:29,00:28:34,they were under. They had psychologists on board to monitor that and work out what was going on.
00:28:35,00:28:39,They did things like make people quit smoking because everyone was smoking up until recently.
00:28:39,00:28:45,"It's only been banned smoking on submarines. So yeah, so they did days of testing psychologically."
00:28:45,00:28:50,What does it do when you stop smoking? It did bad things. Everyone was really irritable.
00:28:50,00:28:57,"So they allowed them to start smoking again. They treated it a bit like a bit of a sightseeing tour,"
00:28:57,00:29:01,"the whole of the trip. So anytime they got near land, the periscope would go up and everyone"
00:29:01,00:29:06,was allowed a turn of just having a look. So they got to Easter Island and everyone had a good old look.
00:29:06,00:29:11,"They pulled up to certain islands, whereas some of the members on board had family living there"
00:29:11,00:29:16,and asked them to out like locate the house on the shore. So one guy actually spotted his mum and
00:29:16,00:29:22,"dad's house through the periscope. And I think that's why this guy, this Filipino guy found them."
00:29:22,00:29:28,Wasn't it? Because they take him the same route as Ferdinand McGellan did when he went around the
00:29:28,00:29:34,"world. And at one stage, they saw that they were near like a statue of McGellan or something."
00:29:34,00:29:37,And so they put the periscope up so everyone could see the statue. And that's where he was.
00:29:37,00:29:44,There's one detail where his story wasn't believed or so we're told because this happened to
00:29:44,00:29:49,"have happened on April fulls day. And so when he came back and said, I saw a sea monster. I was like,"
00:29:49,00:29:54,"okay, mate. Yeah, I sure think. Good day. You wouldn't believe it. You know, would you believe it"
00:29:54,00:29:57,every other day of the year? Someone comes to me and say they've seen a sea monster.
00:29:57,00:30:01,"There's like literally no day of the year except maybe Christmas is a present to them that I say,"
00:30:01,00:30:05,"oh yeah, really cool. Yeah, probably April fulls day is the one day where you go, okay, well,"
00:30:05,00:30:09,that's just too obvious to be an April fulls day. It must be true. Yeah.
00:30:09,00:30:15,"The sentient island was an absolutely key part of the Falkland's War, wasn't it?"
00:30:15,00:30:20,They used this staging post. Yeah. Because that was one of the three. Those three islands aren't
00:30:20,00:30:28,their sentient Tristidicunia. Tristidicunia. The UK took over sentient island when Napoleon was
00:30:28,00:30:32,in St. Helena because they thought that they might use it. He might escape. Yeah.
00:30:32,00:30:38,"It's a very convenient only 2,000 mile away. Hopped to skip on a job to save Napoleon and we can't"
00:30:38,00:30:46,"let it happen. It's not given that it's so remote. So many people visited it. For example,"
00:30:46,00:30:53,"the guy who discovered it was a Portuguese called Hwanda Nova, who's known for some reason in St."
00:30:53,00:30:59,Helena's John Newcastle. He was on his way to India and one of the crewmen on his voyage
00:30:59,00:31:02,was a Marie-Govar Sputchi after whom America is named. Really?
00:31:02,00:31:08,"And then there's Captain Joshua Slocum, the first man to sail single-handed round the world,"
00:31:08,00:31:14,who dropped in there on 1898. He sailed the whole way around the world. You may have done this
00:31:14,00:31:17,"before without being able to swim, which is an extraordinary fact, isn't it?"
00:31:17,00:31:22,"Well, I think it helps. It gives you more of an incentive to sail the world, do you think?"
00:31:22,00:31:25,"Yeah, you're like, we've got to get back there because if we don't get there,"
00:31:25,00:31:30,"I think a lot of sailors, you know, way back, deliberately didn't learn to swim because they"
00:31:30,00:31:33,"didn't want to prolong the drowning. Oh, really?"
00:31:33,00:31:39,"You'd rather have a quick one, yeah. One of the great forges of all time,"
00:31:39,00:31:46,"El Mier de Hori. He was an artist himself, but he wasn't a very good one. He's kind of okay."
00:31:46,00:31:51,"But when he showed one of his paintings to them and called Lady Malcolm Campbell, she saw it."
00:31:51,00:31:56,"She said, ""Oh, is that a Picasso?"" And he was like, ""No, no, it's me, and I can't really sell it,"
00:31:56,00:32:01,"but Picasso seems to be selling quite well. So from now on, I'm just going to paint my stuff and"
00:32:01,00:32:07,"pretend it's from a Picasso. Nice."" And he became really massive. Throughout the forties, he was"
00:32:07,00:32:14,making all sorts of these forgeries of Picasso and Matisse. He created so many Medigliani forgeries
00:32:14,00:32:19,that it's still now as impossible to compile a catalogue of Medigliani's work.
00:32:19,00:32:23,"That's a good idea. Yeah, because we don't know which ones are his and which ones are de Hori's."
00:32:23,00:32:30,And his collection is run now. He was such a big forger that people want to see his paintings.
00:32:30,00:32:40,"And it's run by a guy called Mark Forgy. Really? Wow. On the attribution of, you know, who"
00:32:40,00:32:47,"did what? A Nazi officer saw Gernica when Picasso was there. And he said, ""Did you do that?"""
00:32:47,00:32:54,"And Picasso said, ""No, you did it."" Nice. His only political painting, really."
00:32:54,00:32:59,Really went office paintings during this because he was obsessed with himself and drawing his
00:32:59,00:33:03,women and how tortured they were and what horrible time they were having because he was having affairs.
00:33:03,00:33:08,"And basically, he went out with Doormar, who was very political. She politicized him. He did"
00:33:08,00:33:15,"Gernica. It became a huge anti-war symbol, didn't it? It was a painting of, there was a huge sort of,"
00:33:15,00:33:21,"like, a craft bombing of a village in Spain during the Spanish Civil War, right? By the, by their"
00:33:21,00:33:26,"allies of fascists here. By the Nazis and the Italians. Which was, in fact, a birthday present"
00:33:26,00:33:35,"sweetly from Gering to Hitler. Sweet. So sweet. I just, I wonder what were the circumstances and the"
00:33:35,00:33:41,"situation in which Picasso replied that to a Nazi? Was, were we talking post-war here? Are we talking,"
00:33:41,00:33:47,"like, he wasn't in Nazi Germany, right? That's a pretty bold thing to say to a Nazi is all I'm saying."
00:33:47,00:33:53,"Well, presumably during the war, wasn't it during the Nazi war? Yeah, that's wild. What was the next"
00:33:53,00:33:58,"sentence on the Nazi side? Because I think he was in Paris when the Nazis came into Paris, wasn't he?"
00:33:58,00:34:06,"I think. Yes, and it reminds me of the famous story about Sigmund Freud when he was asked to,"
00:34:06,00:34:15,"in order to get out of Germany under the Nazis, he was asked to sign a disclaimer saying that he"
00:34:15,00:34:21,"hadn't been badly treated. And he wrote, ""I can hardly recommend the Gestapo to anyone. This"
00:34:21,00:34:30,"slightly overdo it."" Do you know which National Anthem contains the word ""moss""? This is a question"
00:34:30,00:34:38,for Andy really. Boss. Boss. Which word? Is it a biggie? Japan. And it's got it. Wow.
00:34:38,00:34:43,Japan. They bloody love monsters. May your world go on for thousands of years until Pebbles merge into
00:34:43,00:34:49,one giant rock and covered with moss. That's the dream. That's lovely. That's very good.
00:34:50,00:34:57,"In a National Anthem survey, 79% of Americans know the first line of the star-spangled banner,"
00:34:57,00:35:04,"but only 37% of Canadians know the first line to O Canada, which is really pathetic considering"
00:35:04,00:35:12,"the first line of O Canada is O Canada. Can I just learn the fact? And, generally,"
00:35:12,00:35:17,"terminates two, one best sound effects editing in 1992. And I think there was this famous moment where"
00:35:18,00:35:24,"T-1000, who I believe is one of the characters, goes through some metal bars and the sound effect"
00:35:24,00:35:29,was achieved by pouring dog food out of a can. And it's quite cool to watch when you know that.
00:35:29,00:35:35,But I didn't know the director of that had such a good money-saving cheat for two separate scenes
00:35:35,00:35:41,"where the terminator, or T-1000, I think can disguise himself as someone else. And so you see a"
00:35:41,00:35:44,character looking at their reflection and then that character turns around and the reflection
00:35:44,00:35:49,still looking at them and you realise it's T-1000. Do you know how he achieves that effect
00:35:49,00:35:57,with a window? I'll give you a clue if you've ever seen the film. Yes. It's the same concept as
00:35:57,00:36:02,the big reveal in that. He used Arnold Schwarzenegger's twin. He used identical twins.
00:36:02,00:36:10,"He used identical twins twice in this film. There's identical twin,"
00:36:10,00:36:16,so those Don and Dan Stanton played a character called Lewis and then T-1000 returning to be him.
00:36:16,00:36:20,"And then Linda Hamilton, who I think was a famous part in that, had an identical twin called"
00:36:20,00:36:25,"Leslie Hamilton. And whenever he needed one of them to do something body-double,"
00:36:25,00:36:29,"isn't it? Was he hiring actors entirely based on- That's great, in that way."
00:36:29,00:36:31,"Yeah. So heads of Tate and cows,"
00:36:31,00:36:37,President Taft of America kept a cow called Pauline on the White House lawn. Do you remember that?
00:36:37,00:36:44,"I didn't remember it. No. So I was collecting names of, naming animals of odd names. So"
00:36:44,00:36:53,"Byron had a pet wolf called Lion. Either reveal is bad, right? When you mean it. Yeah."
00:36:53,00:36:58,"Einstein had a cat called Tiger. Climps Gustav Clint had a cat called Catscaid, he said."
00:36:58,00:37:04,"And the Times journalist Andrew Billin, I read the other day, is called, he's got a cat called"
00:37:04,00:37:09,"Vommy, which is Boad's ill, doesn't it? And I did that, I did really like this."
00:37:09,00:37:15,"Elgar, the composer, spent a lot of time with the heriford cathedral organist dog, who was called Dan."
00:37:15,00:37:23,"Anyway, when Dan fell into the river wine, swam upstream to find a landing place,"
00:37:23,00:37:28,"somebody suggested that Elgar set the whole adventure to music. And he did, he said,"
00:37:28,00:37:34,"have done it, it was called the Enigma Variation. No. Spired by Dan, the dog, and fell into the river."
00:37:34,00:37:40,"I think he's just replaced you as my favorite Dan. Oh, I thought that changed a long ago."
00:37:40,00:37:45,"Yeah. Nice. That's very cool. That's amazing. Whoever that journalist was, what a Billin,"
00:37:45,00:37:54,"he got to share just then, out of nowhere. Taft. Andrew's a really good guy. Byron."
00:37:57,00:38:03,"What's Swindon Famous for? He's a very nice big ride for animals. Yeah, I could say about a football team."
00:38:03,00:38:08,"I thought they, what do they make him, Swindon? Diner doors is famous. He's a Swindon girl,"
00:38:08,00:38:16,and the mayor was introducing her once. He was terribly nervous because her maiden name was Diner
00:38:16,00:38:25,"Fluck, like Peter Fluck. And his head's a gentleman may introduce the lady used to be called"
00:38:25,00:38:39,"Erlichlund. All right, there you go. That is all of our outtakes. If you want to write to any of us"
00:38:39,00:38:45,"about the things that were said in this episode, podcast@ky.com, all those emails go to Andy,"
00:38:45,00:38:49,"he goes through them, and some of them make their way to drop us a line of which there'll be another"
00:38:49,00:38:55,episode popping into your clubfish feed in the next couple of weeks. So do write in. If you want
00:38:55,00:39:00,"to have yours read out on the show, one correction from the outtakes, which we thought worth keeping in"
00:39:00,00:39:05,"anyway, sometimes we just tell stories out loud because someone has said something while we're on"
00:39:05,00:39:11,a tangent. And I just wanted to add a few corrections that brilliantly funny Steve Martin's story
00:39:11,00:39:17,"that I told earlier. So just in case you think in, can't wait for this episode to end, I absolutely"
00:39:17,00:39:21,want to get out there and start spreading this story. There's a few corrections to add about it.
00:39:21,00:39:28,"One is that he was filming Roxanne and he did go into a bar. However, it wasn't because it was the"
00:39:28,00:39:32,end of the day and he was looking for a drink because they were halfway through the filming day.
00:39:32,00:39:36,He had the prosthetics on. He really needed the bathroom. There wasn't one around. Someone pointed
00:39:36,00:39:42,him to that place. He walked in and then the story's pretty much the same. He gets looks from all the
00:39:42,00:39:47,"locals. He's thinking, ""Ooh, am I welcome here or not?"" And a man walks up to him, looks him up and"
00:39:47,00:39:53,"down and says, ""Why the long face?"" There you go. You can now go out into the wild and spread that hilarious"
00:39:53,00:39:58,"story. Alright, that is it everyone. We are going to be back as I say with the droppers of line in"
00:39:58,00:40:02,a couple of weeks. We will see you all then and hopefully some of you in Sheffield. No such thing
00:40:02,00:40:07,"as a fish.com. Check that out and find yourself some tickets. Alright guys, take care. Hope you all"
00:40:07,00:40:19,doing well. We'll speak to you soon. Goodbye.
00:40:19,00:40:21,you
