2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,060
 Hi.

3
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:11,600
 Hello, Andy.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:11,940
 Andy.

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,080
 Welcome to Drops The Line.

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,040
 This is the bit of Clubfish where we talk about your stuff.

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,760
 You know, you've heard us talk about our stuff.

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,560
 We're listening to your emails, your corrections,

9
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,680
 your problems.

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,520
 We're listening to your evils.

11
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,520
 [LAUGHTER]

12
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,080
 Oh, dear.

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:28,500
 OK.

14
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,000
 Right.

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,040
 Well, we should whip straight into it,

16
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,680
 because there's a lot to discuss this time.

17
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,640
 Oh, great.

18
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,600
 Some serious stuff.

19
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,520
 There's some lighter-hearted stuff.

20
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,680
 But it's all good.

21
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,040
 Is there any voicemails to read?

22
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,240
 No voicemails.

23
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,560
 Oh, I wish.

24
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,800
 Next time.

25
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,320
 Yeah, next time.

26
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,640
 Send us a voicemail if you want.

27
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,880
 To where?

28
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,000
 Podcast@qi.com.

29
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,800
 [LAUGHTER]

30
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,920
 OK.

31
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,020
 Must be possible.

32
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,920
 Yeah, that must-- you can attach voice notes.

33
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,640
 That's true.

34
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,560
 We've just opened a big can of worms there.

35
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,560
 Yeah.

36
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,240
 [LAUGHTER]

37
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,700
 Let's start with something from the recent episode.

38
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,300
 Ross writes, thank you for highlighting our lovely town,

39
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,340
 Royal Tumbridge Wells, on your latest episode.

40
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,900
 Very fresh, yeah.

41
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:13,260
 However, as a local, I must correct two errors.

42
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,380
 Firstly, your hosts were pronouncing

43
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,020
 Tumbridge differently to Tumbridge Wells.

44
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,860
 Now, the first Tumbridge I said there was spelt Tonbridge.

45
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:22,460
 Yeah, yeah.

46
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,180
 Yeah.

47
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,220
 However, they are pronounced the same.

48
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,380
 Yeah, do you think it would have been a good idea

49
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,720
 on the show for us to pronounce these two different words

50
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,600
 completely the same?

51
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,260
 Do you think that would have added clarity

52
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,300
 to the conversation?

53
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,360
 No, you're right.

54
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,560
 No, so Tumbridge and Tumbridge Wells, different places,

55
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,400
 spelt differently, is pronounced the same.

56
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,360
 Yeah, pronounced the same.

57
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,120
 I mean, third player, I do also think that by calling it Tonbridge,

58
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,520
 we made it clear that they were two different places.

59
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,080
 Exactly.

60
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,960
 Sometimes we need to cheat the game in order to make it easier.

61
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,500
 Andy, can I make a prediction of what the second naggle is?

62
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,340
 Let me just finish off Ross's first naggle.

63
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,420
 Then you make your prediction, then we'll get into it.

64
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,180
 So this is just a little bonus info from Ross.

65
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:08,180
 Up until 1870, they were both spelled Tumbridge, these places.

66
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:11,020
 But then the GPO, post office, I guess,

67
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:15,720
 decided that Tumbridge needed to become Tonbridge--

68
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,500
 spelt Tonbridge, but pronounced Tumbridge--

69
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,820
 to reduce confusion.

70
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,380
 That's a good fact.

71
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,220
 Has that worked?

72
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,480
 Has that reduced the confusion?

73
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,800
 You know what, it will reduce the confusion

74
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,740
 once people come around to our pronunciation of Tumbridge.

75
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,920
 Then there'll be no confusion whatsoever.

76
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,920
 You're absolutely right.

77
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,080
 Go on, Dan, make your prediction about the second naggle.

78
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,280
 I'm going to suggest that Ross is going to point out

79
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,280
 that my sons weren't born in Tumbridge Wells.

80
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,280
 That's uncanny, Dan, because he says,

81
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:55,160
 "I am a gynecologist," and--

82
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,340
 So the reason I say this is because Tumbridge Wells

83
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,040
 Hospital, which was in Tumbridge Wells,

84
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,800
 got relocated but kept the same name to Pembury, which

85
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,060
 is Pembury.

86
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,360
 It's so on the birth certificate of my children,

87
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,640
 it all says they were born in Pembury as opposed

88
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,920
 to Tumbridge Wells despite keeping the Royal Tumbridge

89
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,040
 Wells Hospital name.

90
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,720
 But I think Pembury is pronounced Tumbridge Wells.

91
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,280
 That's right.

92
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,240
 Yeah.

93
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,600
 All of the towns around the area are all pronounced

94
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,080
 Tumbridge Wells, no matter how they're spelled.

95
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,680
 Sorry, I've just realized I should have said obstetrician

96
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,440
 instead of gynecologist.

97
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,440
 That's a springing a knife to a gunfight

98
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,560
 if you've got a gynecologist at the birth.

99
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,720
 You need an obstetrician.

100
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,840
 I'm sorry, I just want to forestall another email happening.

101
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,040
 Can I make a niggle prediction, please?

102
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,360
 Please, yeah.

103
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,320
 I think it is that there is a waitrose extra in Tumbridge

104
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,480
 Wells, even though there isn't a waitrose.

105
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,600
 Is that right?

106
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,120
 Well, James, you'll be amazed to hear

107
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,360
 James' prediction is the right one.

108
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,520
 OK, not Dan's.

109
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,320
 Well, Pembury, I suggest to Ross

110
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,400
 that he may be a bit more sort of panickity

111
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,680
 with his problems.

112
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,360
 Ross says.

113
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,800
 My sons are born in Pembury, Dickhead, not in Tumbridge

114
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,720
 Wells.

115
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,880
 You're even listening?

116
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,760
 Sorry, sorry, Ross.

117
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,360
 Sorry, Ross.

118
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,320
 I lost my cool there.

119
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,760
 Don't worry, it's all good.

120
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,600
 Ross says exactly the change predicted.

121
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,840
 Second, and more vitally, we do have a waitrose.

122
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,280
 However, I will accept that it is not a true waitrose, merely

123
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,000
 a little waitrose attached to a petrol station,

124
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,480
 and it only sprang up recently.

125
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,760
 I don't want to speak for you guys.

126
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,200
 I did find that in my research, and I

127
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,480
 thought that's not a proper waitrose.

128
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,400
 So it's a petrol station with a few waitrose products.

129
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,040
 Yeah, our mutual friend, Mike Fenton Stevens,

130
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,040
 tweeted this as well.

131
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,440
 He says that what they should actually name those are

132
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,600
 wheatrose, as in little wheat.

133
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,560
 Oh, that's good.

134
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,240
 Lovely.

135
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,120
 Lovely to hear.

136
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,800
 Really nice.

137
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,160
 I noticed that we mentioned Wilco on the show.

138
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,240
 Oh, yeah.

139
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,480
 And no more than two or three days after we recorded that,

140
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,600
 Wilco went into administration, which was very sad.

141
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,360
 No, no, it was before, which is why I say in the show.

142
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,040
 And not even that's going to be there anymore.

143
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,640
 It was.

144
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,800
 Oh, is that right?

145
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,080
 So this--

146
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,320
 So listener, I edited out Dan's joke there,

147
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,440
 because I didn't understand it.

148
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,840
 Because I didn't see the news until after we'd

149
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,560
 done the show, and in fact, until after I'd edited the show.

150
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,000
 So I took out that bit because I thought

151
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,400
 it must have been referring to something

152
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,360
 that I didn't understand.

153
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,960
 So I really-- I am sorry, Dan.

154
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,640
 I took out one of your good jokes there.

155
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,640
 No, that's fine.

156
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,720
 It's in the-- it's-- if you watch online,

157
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,200
 there's a video of us talking about the specific bit.

158
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,400
 And that's-- that's where it was.

159
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,680
 That's why I remember, because I heard myself say it there.

160
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,880
 Yeah, the person who edited that video, which I assume is Liam,

161
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,840
 she obviously is more on board with her supermarket news

162
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,040
 than I am.

163
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,920
 Well, on we go.

164
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,520
 Thank you, Ross.

165
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,360
 I feel like that's cleared it up a lot.

166
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:44,840
 Definitely.

167
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,160
 Sorry for calling you a dickhead, Ross.

168
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,360
 That was-- I think I was really calling myself a dickhead.

169
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,520
 OK, here's one.

170
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,000
 This is an interesting one, actually.

171
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,320
 This is from Ausra Girdalskeiter.

172
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,240
 And I know I've pronounced your first name right

173
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,240
 and your second name wrong, because you told me

174
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,520
 how to pronounce your first name, but not your second name.

175
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,040
 Anyway, greetings from continental Europe.

176
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,680
 I had a cool synchronicity happen

177
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,800
 while listening to the podcast.

178
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,640
 I've been re-listening to the episodes from the beginning,

179
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,160
 and during my morning gym session,

180
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,920
 I was on number 226.

181
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,880
 When I came home and clicked on the latest episode

182
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,200
 at the time, 490, I heard Dan's bit about putting poo

183
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,040
 on the inside versus outside of a spaceship.

184
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,520
 And I got kind of confused, because I've just listened to it.

185
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,480
 If you listen to episode 226 from around 1954--

186
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,560
 "19 Minutes, 54," an episode 4--

187
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,640
 I thought we'd been doing this podcast for a long time,

188
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,120
 haven't we?

189
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,160
 It certainly feels that way.

190
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,240
 An episode 490 from around the 45-22,

191
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,280
 you can hear Dan being confused on where to put poo

192
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,800
 on your spaceship twice.

193
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,520
 And it turns out we've done exactly this riff before.

194
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,040
 Isn't that really interesting?

195
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,600
 Because what I always see online is a comedian

196
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,320
 will make a joke in their set, and then another comedian

197
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,040
 will turn around and say, "Well, you stole that from me.

198
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,560
 I did that first."

199
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,120
 And that might be the case sometimes,

200
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,320
 but I think often sometimes there's just, like you say,

201
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,000
 synchronicity, and two people just have the same idea.

202
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,600
 It's very rare that the same person

203
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,960
 has the same idea for a joke as themselves

204
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,320
 from a couple of years earlier.

205
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,720
 And it's like five or six years ago that we did that.

206
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,480
 Because that was what, 226?

207
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,160
 That's like four or five years in.

208
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,080
 Yeah.

209
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,680
 And so what we tend to do is, before we do an episode,

210
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,000
 if we have a subject, we will scan through this giant Excel

211
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,200
 spreadsheet that Andy keeps log of,

212
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,040
 which has something like over 20,000 facts in it now

213
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,360
 from the 70 years that we've been going.

214
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:45,960
 And you can look up things that you've said as a fact,

215
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,360
 but often the anecdotes don't necessarily make it in.

216
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,440
 Or if they do, you don't really look for that.

217
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,880
 So you find yourself on stage saying a thought that you go,

218
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,200
 "Oh, yeah, it's weird."

219
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,680
 Like when I said that, I did feel like,

220
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,720
 "I feel like I've said this before."

221
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,200
 But you just say it anyway.

222
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,720
 It is slightly different both times, but it's very weird.

223
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,280
 It's this weird synchronicity.

224
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,920
 So it's like a sort of funny wormhole.

225
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,880
 Yeah.

226
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,640
 Here's one.

227
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,280
 Yeah.

228
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,040
 This is quite an exciting one.

229
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,960
 It's from an anonymous source.

230
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,680
 OK.

231
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,800
 A whistleblower.

232
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,920
 A deep throat.

233
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,480
 Listen to this since 2016.

234
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,560
 Confirming some facts mentioned in episode 488

235
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,480
 and also sharing a few unconfirmed facts

236
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,000
 about the Pentagon.

237
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,600
 Mm, cool.

238
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,880
 Bum, bum, bum.

239
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,240
 We've got someone inside the building.

240
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,640
 I'm a member of the US active military.

241
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,600
 And was stationed at the Pentagon from 2014 to '18.

242
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,960
 I saw firsthand the Pokemon Go craze

243
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,440
 as I was one of the participants.

244
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,280
 The central courtyard was indeed a previous Pokemon Joe--

245
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,240
 Pokemon Go, Jim.

246
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,160
 Have you just given away this guy's name?

247
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,840
 Oh, no.

248
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,160
 It's Pokemon Joe, the 30th battalion.

249
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,200
 And our source says, "Many folks during smoke breaks

250
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,720
 would sit on the park benches during the day

251
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,840
 to fight for control.

252
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,280
 And I would sometimes see upwards of 100 people wandering

253
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,360
 or sitting, obviously playing, but trying

254
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,320
 to be inconspicuous about their intentions."

255
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,880
 100 people.

256
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,000
 That really is amazing.

257
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,840
 That's incredible.

258
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,680
 I know.

259
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,840
 A couple of other-- just a little bonus fact.

260
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,120
 Because we talked about the tour guides walking backwards.

261
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,620
 Yes.

262
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,880
 And keep an eye on everyone.

263
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,840
 And they know the exact number of steps

264
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,200
 that they'll need to take in order to then cut a right

265
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,800
 without turning around and looking.

266
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,520
 So clever.

267
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,040
 Well, our source, Pokemon Joe, writes,

268
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,960
 "That is most likely true, although they always

269
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,440
 have someone also walking forward from the back

270
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,400
 to keep eyes on the entire group."

271
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,400
 OK.

272
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,440
 I wondered with those guys, do they count the number of steps,

273
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,360
 Dan, did you say?

274
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,080
 Or they use landmarks.

275
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,640
 So like a fire hydrant might suggest, OK, that's there.

276
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,760
 I know that there is a--

277
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,440
 10 more steps backwards or whatever.

278
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,920
 Because that's, of course, we learned a few years ago.

279
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,800
 That's how ants managed to find their way back to the nests.

280
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,160
 They count the number of steps.

281
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,400
 And the reason-- and the way they found that out

282
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,600
 is they put little stilts on the ants.

283
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,120
 And when they put the stilts on, they always overshot.

284
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,840
 Because they count the number of steps.

285
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,800
 But obviously, the stride is longer, so they missed the nest.

286
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,560
 Yes.

287
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,480
 So I was wondering if you were to put tour guides

288
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,920
 in the Pentagon in different highted shoes,

289
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,720
 whether it would completely throw them off.

290
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,480
 Oh, yeah, that's a good test.

291
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,760
 Pokemon Joe could maybe--

292
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,920
 oh, no, he's not there anymore.

293
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,160
 Pokemon Joe, get back in.

294
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,720
 Pokemon Joe writes, "Happy to answer other questions

295
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,760
 within reason."

296
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,520
 Brilliant.

297
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,840
 Would you say that one was within reason?

298
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,640
 Yeah, I do.

299
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,280
 I do.

300
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,040
 Great.

301
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,040
 Well, looks forward to reply next month.

302
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,120
 Thank you, Joe.

303
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,960
 Very quick one from Grant Winjones.

304
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,240
 Loved Ella Alshama.

305
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,480
 He's fascinating spiel on James Cameron.

306
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,080
 Oh, yeah.

307
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,360
 This is a week or two ago.

308
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,720
 I was googling him and discovered

309
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,680
 that in addition to his engineering genius,

310
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,000
 he is also artistic.

311
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,400
 He did the sketch of Kate Winslet in Titanic.

312
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,040
 Did he?

313
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:56,480
 Yeah.

314
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,200
 The new sketch of Kate Winslet.

315
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,040
 I think that's a bit creepy, isn't it?

316
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,800
 Oh, the director is insisting that--

317
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,600
 I'm afraid he's the only one qualified to draw you naked

318
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,000
 for this bit of the film.

319
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,040
 Sorry.

320
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:08,760
 Yeah, that's true.

321
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,640
 Now, we should get on to it.

322
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,400
 We've actually got a proper correction

323
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,080
 to make, which is from something we've

324
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,440
 had a lot of correspondence about as well.

325
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,200
 Sample email subject line, Wicca versus Satanist.

326
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,280
 Another email subject line, Satanic temple info.

327
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,920
 Why would Wicca's be against Satanist

328
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,280
 when they're exactly the same people?

329
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,600
 That doesn't make any sense.

330
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,880
 Well, that's the funny thing, James.

331
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,080
 Yeah, absolutely.

332
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,520
 So it turns out that they're really, really not.

333
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,680
 And basically, we've had a lot of correspondence.

334
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,200
 More like Satan isn't.

335
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,440
 That was a very good email subject line there.

336
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,160
 And basically, we slightly, I think, let the impression

337
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,360
 happen that Wicca and Satanism is the same thing,

338
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,480
 or that Wicca's enjoy a spot of devil worship.

339
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,400
 And that's not true.

340
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,880
 Can I ask, Andy, first of all, did you

341
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,400
 get any Satanists who were annoyed that they'd

342
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,560
 been compared to Wicca people?

343
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,480
 No.

344
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,400
 I got one person writing in saying these are different,

345
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,640
 and I'm neither.

346
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,920
 But no, I don't think any Satanists saying,

347
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,720
 I've just finished a spot of devil worship,

348
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,080
 and we're nothing like the neo-pagan religion of Wicca.

349
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,960
 OK, so are you going to quickly explain to us

350
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,840
 what Wicca is, just so that we--

351
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,200
 Yeah, here's a sample from one of our correspondence.

352
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,600
 Wicca is a neo-pagan religion compiled

353
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,480
 by Gerald Gardner in the mid-20th century.

354
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,800
 There are lots of other aspects of paganism, none of which

355
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,520
 contain Satanism, which is an ideological viewpoint,

356
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,640
 rather than the following of a full religion.

357
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,920
 So lots of clarification there.

358
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,440
 We're very happy to set the record straight.

359
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,360
 Wicca is a harmless nature-based religion,

360
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,600
 nothing to do with the devil.

361
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,160
 OK.

362
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,000
 Wow.

363
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,360
 This is great news.

364
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:50,920
 Yeah.

365
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,600
 Oh, is it?

366
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,720
 Oh, yeah, absolutely, because this

367
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,320
 is now going to be the new classical musicians don't

368
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,280
 need sheet music to play.

369
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,960
 It's as if I've planted this story just

370
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,320
 to take the heat off the correspondence on that

371
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,080
 coming in now.

372
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,840
 So very excited for this mess up.

373
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,360
 Oh, no, we've got an email in.

374
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,000
 It's from a Wiccan bassoonist.

375
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 Yeah, so there we go.

376
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,240
 We mustered it in the show, the slightly different things,

377
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,880
 but we could have made it very much clearer.

378
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,040
 So apologies to all Wiccans listening.

379
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,080
 Who did get quite offended.

380
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:29,800
 So yeah, we are genuinely sorry, because it did raise a bit of--

381
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,000
 I guess it is one of those things that sometimes does

382
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,840
 get presented as if it has a connection,

383
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,920
 and it does bad for their reputation.

384
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,120
 It makes possibly in ways we don't appreciate.

385
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,880
 Also, lots of the Satanists, we were to quote unquote Satanists

386
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,180
 we were talking about, are basically free speech campaigners.

387
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:48,960
 We mentioned very few people who actually worship the devil.

388
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,200
 Is it the Satanic temple, who are the anti--

389
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,040
 they're anti-government libertarians who also take the Mechie.

390
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,840
 So anyway, I hope that's clear.

391
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,800
 Let's move on to another silly email.

392
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,040
 Here's one from Andreas Marti on suffragettes.

393
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,280
 Last episode also, James mentioned--

394
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,920
 this is about the suffragette thing.

395
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,120
 Oh, it's about Swiss women getting the vote,

396
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,480
 and the year they get that.

397
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,280
 So it's actually nothing to do with that topic.

398
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,640
 It's another tombridge-tombridge.

399
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,360
 It's-- James mentioned the Canton--

400
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,040
 Appenzell--

401
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,320
 Appenzell, yeah.

402
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,720
 Alsurrodin, regarding the women's right to vote.

403
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,120
 James said it-- I'm just reading the email, James.

404
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,200
 I don't think it is.

405
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:35,200
 But James said it as Alsurrodin, instead of the correct

406
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,280
 Alsurrodin, because the second word starts with the second r.

407
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:43,080
 This is hilarious because, Andreas writes,

408
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,720
 "Hoden means testicles in German."

409
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,680
 So James said, "outer testicle," instead of "outer roger."

410
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,840
 I'm such a comedy genius that I could see that comedy.

411
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,160
 I could see the word "testicle" in that word.

412
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,440
 Even though I didn't know any German,

413
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,040
 I just knew it must be funny.

414
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,800
 I've got to imagine that the laugh that you have got over

415
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,680
 in Germany that we just no one else has got,

416
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,200
 you've created bilingual laughter.

417
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,160
 Everyone listening to the show in Appenzell,

418
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,160
 whatever testicles, they would have been just probably

419
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,640
 thousands, if not tens of thousands of people listening

420
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,640
 there will have just been loving it.

421
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,560
 It's huge.

422
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,520
 That's great.

423
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,320
 And so anyway, I wrote to thank Andreas for that information.

424
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,560
 There's also an Appenzell inner rodent, inner testicle,

425
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,160
 inner Hoden.

426
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,640
 So I just wrote saying, thank you.

427
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,160
 We'll read that out on Drops Align.

428
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,960
 And Andreas Marty then actuallyed himself unbelievable

429
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,280
 by saying, "By the way, Appenzell Also rodent

430
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,560
 "and Appenzell inner rodent are half cantons,

431
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,120
 "not full cantons.

432
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,080
 "Each one has only one seat in the upper house of parliament.

433
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,880
 "The former canton Appenzell split in two

434
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,760
 "during the reformation in 1597.

435
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,960
 "Inner rodent is Catholic while Also rodent is not."

436
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,800
 Right.

437
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,200
 'Cause I don't want to get more emails about that.

438
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,040
 That's about that.

439
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,000
 Brilliant.

440
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,800
 So they're not cantons, they're canstons.

441
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,600
 That's superb.

442
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,680
 Yeah, I was just channeling the Wiccan joke from earlier on.

443
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,520
 Yeah.

444
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,360
 Love it.

445
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,360
 Satan isn't.

446
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,560
 Oh, there's one bit of corroboration that we got.

447
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,400
 Oh, lovely.

448
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,240
 That's nice to hear.

449
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,200
 You were right, you were right.

450
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,960
 Eversteena Pauli writes,

451
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,480
 "This is the longest distance callback of the week."

452
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,760
 That's a fun section we can run.

453
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:33,080
 I was listening to old episodes.

454
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,400
 I was delighted to hear a question I can answer.

455
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,440
 It was episode 127.

456
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,280
 Great.

457
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,240
 Well, eight years ago, maybe, seven or eight years ago.

458
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,280
 Alex is on the show and he says,

459
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,360
 "Among all the things left on the moon are nail clippers.

460
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,240
 "Why would anyone bring nail clippers to space?"

461
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,080
 He asks.

462
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,920
 Oh, yeah.

463
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,800
 Well, nail clippers are actually crucial

464
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,440
 for any astronauts who prefer not to have

465
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,160
 their fingernails fall off.

466
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:59,440
 Because you need to protect the astronauts' hands

467
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,400
 and the bulky and ill-fitting gloves can result

468
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,440
 in their fingernails falling off

469
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,880
 like the way runners might lose toenails.

470
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,440
 So, at least having well-trained nails is a necessity,

471
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,280
 especially for big-handed astronauts.

472
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,120
 Yeah.

473
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,200
 At least one astronaut has reportedly solved this issue

474
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,680
 by removing their own fingernails

475
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,360
 as a preventative measure before leaving for the ISS.

476
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,680
 Wow.

477
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,760
 Wow.

478
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,680
 That's stunning.

479
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,520
 Oh, my God.

480
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,600
 That's amazing.

481
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,360
 Yeah, because actually long-distance runners

482
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,760
 remove their toenails sometimes before races

483
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:34,160
 because it's less painful than them falling off

484
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,280
 by accident.

485
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,720
 And yeah, I have heard that about the gloves,

486
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,680
 at least the old gloves.

487
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,120
 They're really solid.

488
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,160
 They're like, you know, almost like plastic tubes

489
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,160
 as opposed to just nice gloves.

490
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,000
 Right.

491
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,080
 So, they aren't molded to your hands

492
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,080
 or the old ones weren't.

493
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,480
 And so, yeah, they would just be rattling around

494
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,640
 inside them all the time.

495
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,960
 And if they don't fit very well, that's going to happen.

496
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,800
 Wow.

497
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,480
 They're not like surgical, they're not like rubber gloves.

498
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,240
 They're like big, thick, bulky, yeah, yeah.

499
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,080
 Ever seen a race?

500
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,480
 This is how she knows it.

501
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,320
 I love this.

502
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,240
 I fell into the rabbit hole of astronauts' nails

503
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,760
 and nail clippers when collaborating

504
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,360
 with a NASA engineer during my master's studies

505
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,960
 in industrial design in 2018.

506
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,920
 His name is Douglas Wong, and he has been working

507
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,880
 on a zero-gravity nail clipper with suction

508
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,280
 that he is calling Nail Caps,

509
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,720
 the Nail Clipping's airborne prevention system.

510
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,120
 The aim is to prevent nail clippings flying around the ISS

511
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,240
 and ending up getting in experiments

512
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,360
 and machinery or the astronauts' eyes or lungs.

513
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,200
 Yeah.

514
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,040
 That must be tough.

515
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,720
 You accidentally swallow someone's toenail clippings.

516
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,760
 Someone else's toenail clippings as well.

517
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,600
 Yeah.

518
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,840
 You could just do your fellow astronauts

519
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,600
 just clipping their nails into the zero-gravity.

520
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,440
 Give us another one.

521
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,920
 All right, here's one.

522
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,160
 Oh, this is a great one.

523
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,720
 This is from Andres Kutt.

524
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,920
 Andrea writes, "In episode 486 of Fish,

525
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,000
 you guys discussed passengers landing in aircraft.

526
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,680
 It has also been covered on QI.

527
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,920
 But did you know there is a place

528
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,040
 where passengers always land the plane?"

529
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,320
 Oh, that's really good.

530
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,400
 Is it a quiz?

531
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,040
 Can we work it out?

532
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,120
 I think-- you probably could work it out, actually.

533
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,160
 You're very good at quizzes.

534
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,360
 I didn't work it out.

535
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:07,860
 OK.

536
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:11,960
 So it must be some reason that the pilot can't do it.

537
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,460
 Yes.

538
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:16,740
 So perhaps there's no pilot on the plane normally.

539
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,760
 Perhaps the pilot--

540
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,280
 huh, the passengers--

541
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,000
 oh, I know it.

542
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,280
 It's like, you know, in the Flintstones where they have cars

543
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,040
 and the legs come out of the bottom and they run along.

544
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,920
 There's some really old planes where the seats--

545
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,280
 like, your legs sort of dangle out of the bottom.

546
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,480
 And then as the plane comes into land,

547
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,240
 everyone has to run at the same time.

548
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,520
 Yeah, yeah, there's classic planes.

549
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,760
 There's classic planes with no flaws.

550
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,000
 Is it-- he's got it.

551
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,680
 He's got it.

552
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,000
 I think he's almost got it.

553
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,280
 I think it is old planes.

554
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,600
 And I think it's those planes.

555
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,360
 And I think we've spoken about it on Fish Before, whereby

556
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,920
 the plane comes and basically, effectively,

557
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,240
 comes so slow and hovers that people

558
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,280
 pull the plane down from the outside.

559
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,200
 No.

560
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:02,600
 What?

561
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,280
 I think that used to happen on air hangers in a--

562
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,480
 Where are the airships?

563
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,360
 Sorry, airships.

564
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,920
 Rather-- sorry, airships out at sea.

565
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,800
 You would-- yeah, people used to help the plane land

566
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,400
 by physically pulling it down.

567
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,840
 That's amazing.

568
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,280
 Wow.

569
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,520
 If true.

570
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,000
 I was hoping that was the answer,

571
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,080
 as if that would corroborate my--

572
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:22,960
 That's not it.

573
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,520
 --weird ass idea, I just said.

574
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,520
 This is current.

575
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,680
 Passengers land the plane.

576
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,920
 It's a slight--

577
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,640
 Andres is playing a little bit.

578
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,120
 Ah.

579
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,240
 Is it pilot?

580
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,800
 Is it the word pilot?

581
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,840
 The pilot is called passenger.

582
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,680
 And so is his co-pilot.

583
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,680
 Right.

584
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,640
 You're right.

585
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,080
 It's not pilot for a boat.

586
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,360
 You pilot a boat, right?

587
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,440
 It's definitely planes.

588
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,080
 Oh, that's clever.

589
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,040
 And we're talking planes.

590
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,240
 There's no one on a boat here.

591
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:48,880
 We're talking planes.

592
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,160
 Oh, this is such a good riddle.

593
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,120
 I didn't realize it was this good a riddle.

594
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:52,960
 It's a riddle.

595
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,880
 Love the plane.

596
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,880
 Passengers land the plane.

597
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,960
 Shall I tell you?

598
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,320
 Yeah, you're going to have to tell us.

599
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,360
 OK.

600
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,400
 All right, here we go.

601
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,640
 Andres writes, when I took a flight from Singapore

602
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,720
 to Paro via Kolkata, there was a guy sitting

603
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,760
 at the front of the airplane across the aisle from me.

604
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,960
 So a passenger, right?

605
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,200
 Yeah.

606
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,120
 Just before landing, he stood up and went into the cockpit.

607
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,160
 It turns out that the landing in Paro is so tricky.

608
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,120
 I've been to a airport, Paro.

609
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,600
 Well, only the pilots of the Bhutan Royal

610
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,040
 Airline are allowed to do the landing.

611
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,320
 But for the rest of the flight, they are a passenger.

612
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,480
 That's really clever.

613
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,440
 That's clever.

614
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,880
 I have been in that airport, Paro, in Bhutan.

615
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,640
 So you've had this experience.

616
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,920
 You went flying there.

617
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,600
 Yeah, I did.

618
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:42,360
 But I only flew from either Kathmandu or somewhere like that,

619
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,680
 somewhere in Nepal I flew from.

620
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,800
 So the same pilot took the whole journey.

621
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,280
 I'm pretty sure.

622
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,400
 Oh, I see.

623
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,040
 I think it'd be a great way to prank people.

624
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,360
 Yeah, yeah.

625
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,120
 Someone comes out of the cockpit and say, oh, my god.

626
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,960
 Can anyone fly or land a plane?

627
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,400
 Yeah, but you've just got some confident Twitter bro going,

628
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,640
 yeah, I could do it, mate.

629
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,160
 I could do it.

630
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,720
 And then he's going to have a big argument

631
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,920
 with the actual pilot, where the pilot's going, no, no.

632
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,160
 I actually am a pilot.

633
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,440
 The other guy's like, yeah, but I'm pretty confident.

634
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,560
 I feel like I could do it.

635
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,920
 I used to watch the Crypton Factor.

636
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,200
 How hard could it be?

637
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,920
 Also, sometimes on those smaller planes,

638
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,720
 the toilet happens to be right next to the cockpit door.

639
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,240
 You wouldn't want to misunderstand it,

640
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,360
 where someone's got up for a poo, opens the door of the pilot,

641
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,440
 and he's going, oh, come sit.

642
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,480
 Yeah, take us in, buddy.

643
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,440
 Yes, that's brilliant.

644
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,760
 And it's like a stag do.

645
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,440
 And as a joke, the stag has come dressed as a member

646
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,640
 of our Bhutanese Air Class.

647
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:47,160
 Anymore!

648
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,440
 Oh, my god.

649
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,120
 That's a brilliant question.

650
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,920
 Anymore of these kind of riddle me this.

651
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,440
 Yeah.

652
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,760
 That's really great.

 I'm going to write it on my list of segments

656
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,440
 We've done get yourself off the hook.

 We've had an arm actually of the week.

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,040
 We haven't had any spicy meat.

659
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,600
 Haven't had plug corner.

660
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,920
 It's been a very format light episode of Drop As A Line.

661
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,320
 Oh, god, despite the fact that the theory of everything else

662
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,560
 is still available in all shards.

663
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,000
 Weird.

664
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,880
 We haven't mentioned it.

665
