00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.560
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.060
 Hi.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.600
 Hello, Andy.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.940
 Andy.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.080
 Welcome to Drops The Line.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.040
 This is the bit of Clubfish where we talk about your stuff.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.760
 You know, you've heard us talk about our stuff.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.560
 We're listening to your emails, your corrections,

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.680
 your problems.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.520
 We're listening to your evils.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.080
 Oh, dear.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.500
 OK.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.000
 Right.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.040
 Well, we should whip straight into it,

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.680
 because there's a lot to discuss this time.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.640
 Oh, great.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.600
 Some serious stuff.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.520
 There's some lighter-hearted stuff.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.680
 But it's all good.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.040
 Is there any voicemails to read?

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.240
 No voicemails.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.560
 Oh, I wish.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.800
 Next time.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.320
 Yeah, next time.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.640
 Send us a voicemail if you want.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.880
 To where?

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.000
 Podcast@qi.com.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.800
 [LAUGHTER]

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.920
 OK.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.020
 Must be possible.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.920
 Yeah, that must-- you can attach voice notes.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:53.640
 That's true.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.560
 We've just opened a big can of worms there.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.560
 Yeah.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.240
 [LAUGHTER]

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.700
 Let's start with something from the recent episode.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.300
 Ross writes, thank you for highlighting our lovely town,

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.340
 Royal Tumbridge Wells, on your latest episode.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.900
 Very fresh, yeah.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.260
 However, as a local, I must correct two errors.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.380
 Firstly, your hosts were pronouncing

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.020
 Tumbridge differently to Tumbridge Wells.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.860
 Now, the first Tumbridge I said there was spelt Tonbridge.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:22.460
 Yeah, yeah.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.180
 Yeah.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.220
 However, they are pronounced the same.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.380
 Yeah, do you think it would have been a good idea

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.720
 on the show for us to pronounce these two different words

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.600
 completely the same?

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.260
 Do you think that would have added clarity

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.300
 to the conversation?

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.360
 No, you're right.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.560
 No, so Tumbridge and Tumbridge Wells, different places,

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.400
 spelt differently, is pronounced the same.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.360
 Yeah, pronounced the same.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.120
 I mean, third player, I do also think that by calling it Tonbridge,

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.520
 we made it clear that they were two different places.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.080
 Exactly.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.960
 Sometimes we need to cheat the game in order to make it easier.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.500
 Andy, can I make a prediction of what the second naggle is?

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.340
 Let me just finish off Ross's first naggle.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.420
 Then you make your prediction, then we'll get into it.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.180
 So this is just a little bonus info from Ross.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.180
 Up until 1870, they were both spelled Tumbridge, these places.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.020
 But then the GPO, post office, I guess,

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.720
 decided that Tumbridge needed to become Tonbridge--

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.500
 spelt Tonbridge, but pronounced Tumbridge--

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.820
 to reduce confusion.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.380
 That's a good fact.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.220
 Has that worked?

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.480
 Has that reduced the confusion?

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.800
 You know what, it will reduce the confusion

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.740
 once people come around to our pronunciation of Tumbridge.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.920
 Then there'll be no confusion whatsoever.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.920
 You're absolutely right.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.080
 Go on, Dan, make your prediction about the second naggle.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.280
 I'm going to suggest that Ross is going to point out

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.280
 that my sons weren't born in Tumbridge Wells.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.280
 That's uncanny, Dan, because he says,

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:55.160
 "I am a gynecologist," and--

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.340
 So the reason I say this is because Tumbridge Wells

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.040
 Hospital, which was in Tumbridge Wells,

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.800
 got relocated but kept the same name to Pembury, which

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.060
 is Pembury.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.360
 It's so on the birth certificate of my children,

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.640
 it all says they were born in Pembury as opposed

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.920
 to Tumbridge Wells despite keeping the Royal Tumbridge

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.040
 Wells Hospital name.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.720
 But I think Pembury is pronounced Tumbridge Wells.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.280
 That's right.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.240
 Yeah.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.600
 All of the towns around the area are all pronounced

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.080
 Tumbridge Wells, no matter how they're spelled.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.680
 Sorry, I've just realized I should have said obstetrician

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.440
 instead of gynecologist.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.440
 That's a springing a knife to a gunfight

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.560
 if you've got a gynecologist at the birth.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.720
 You need an obstetrician.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.840
 I'm sorry, I just want to forestall another email happening.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.040
 Can I make a niggle prediction, please?

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.360
 Please, yeah.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.320
 I think it is that there is a waitrose extra in Tumbridge

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.480
 Wells, even though there isn't a waitrose.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.600
 Is that right?

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.120
 Well, James, you'll be amazed to hear

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.360
 James' prediction is the right one.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.520
 OK, not Dan's.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.320
 Well, Pembury, I suggest to Ross

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.400
 that he may be a bit more sort of panickity

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.680
 with his problems.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.360
 Ross says.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.800
 My sons are born in Pembury, Dickhead, not in Tumbridge

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.720
 Wells.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:08.880
 You're even listening?

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:09.760
 Sorry, sorry, Ross.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.360
 Sorry, Ross.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.320
 I lost my cool there.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.760
 Don't worry, it's all good.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.600
 Ross says exactly the change predicted.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.840
 Second, and more vitally, we do have a waitrose.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.280
 However, I will accept that it is not a true waitrose, merely

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.000
 a little waitrose attached to a petrol station,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.480
 and it only sprang up recently.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.760
 I don't want to speak for you guys.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.200
 I did find that in my research, and I

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.480
 thought that's not a proper waitrose.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.400
 So it's a petrol station with a few waitrose products.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.040
 Yeah, our mutual friend, Mike Fenton Stevens,

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.040
 tweeted this as well.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.440
 He says that what they should actually name those are

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.600
 wheatrose, as in little wheat.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.560
 Oh, that's good.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.240
 Lovely.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.120
 Lovely to hear.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.800
 Really nice.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.160
 I noticed that we mentioned Wilco on the show.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.240
 Oh, yeah.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.480
 And no more than two or three days after we recorded that,

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.600
 Wilco went into administration, which was very sad.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.360
 No, no, it was before, which is why I say in the show.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.040
 And not even that's going to be there anymore.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.640
 It was.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:00.800
 Oh, is that right?

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.080
 So this--

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.320
 So listener, I edited out Dan's joke there,

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.440
 because I didn't understand it.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.840
 Because I didn't see the news until after we'd

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.560
 done the show, and in fact, until after I'd edited the show.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.000
 So I took out that bit because I thought

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.400
 it must have been referring to something

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.360
 that I didn't understand.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.960
 So I really-- I am sorry, Dan.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.640
 I took out one of your good jokes there.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:23.640
 No, that's fine.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.720
 It's in the-- it's-- if you watch online,

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.200
 there's a video of us talking about the specific bit.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.400
 And that's-- that's where it was.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.680
 That's why I remember, because I heard myself say it there.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.880
 Yeah, the person who edited that video, which I assume is Liam,

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.840
 she obviously is more on board with her supermarket news

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.040
 than I am.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.920
 Well, on we go.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.520
 Thank you, Ross.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.360
 I feel like that's cleared it up a lot.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.840
 Definitely.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.160
 Sorry for calling you a dickhead, Ross.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.360
 That was-- I think I was really calling myself a dickhead.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.520
 OK, here's one.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.000
 This is an interesting one, actually.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.320
 This is from Ausra Girdalskeiter.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.240
 And I know I've pronounced your first name right

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.240
 and your second name wrong, because you told me

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.520
 how to pronounce your first name, but not your second name.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.040
 Anyway, greetings from continental Europe.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.680
 I had a cool synchronicity happen

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.800
 while listening to the podcast.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.640
 I've been re-listening to the episodes from the beginning,

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.160
 and during my morning gym session,

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.920
 I was on number 226.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.880
 When I came home and clicked on the latest episode

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.200
 at the time, 490, I heard Dan's bit about putting poo

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.040
 on the inside versus outside of a spaceship.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.520
 And I got kind of confused, because I've just listened to it.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.480
 If you listen to episode 226 from around 1954--

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.560
 "19 Minutes, 54," an episode 4--

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.640
 I thought we'd been doing this podcast for a long time,

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.120
 haven't we?

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.160
 It certainly feels that way.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.240
 An episode 490 from around the 45-22,

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.280
 you can hear Dan being confused on where to put poo

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.800
 on your spaceship twice.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.520
 And it turns out we've done exactly this riff before.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.040
 Isn't that really interesting?

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.600
 Because what I always see online is a comedian

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.320
 will make a joke in their set, and then another comedian

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.040
 will turn around and say, "Well, you stole that from me.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.560
 I did that first."

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.120
 And that might be the case sometimes,

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.320
 but I think often sometimes there's just, like you say,

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.000
 synchronicity, and two people just have the same idea.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.600
 It's very rare that the same person

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.960
 has the same idea for a joke as themselves

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.320
 from a couple of years earlier.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.720
 And it's like five or six years ago that we did that.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.480
 Because that was what, 226?

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.160
 That's like four or five years in.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.080
 Yeah.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.680
 And so what we tend to do is, before we do an episode,

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.000
 if we have a subject, we will scan through this giant Excel

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.200
 spreadsheet that Andy keeps log of,

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.040
 which has something like over 20,000 facts in it now

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.360
 from the 70 years that we've been going.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:45.960
 And you can look up things that you've said as a fact,

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.360
 but often the anecdotes don't necessarily make it in.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.440
 Or if they do, you don't really look for that.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.880
 So you find yourself on stage saying a thought that you go,

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.200
 "Oh, yeah, it's weird."

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.680
 Like when I said that, I did feel like,

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.720
 "I feel like I've said this before."

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.200
 But you just say it anyway.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.720
 It is slightly different both times, but it's very weird.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.280
 It's this weird synchronicity.

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.920
 So it's like a sort of funny wormhole.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:07.880
 Yeah.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:08.640
 Here's one.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:09.280
 Yeah.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.040
 This is quite an exciting one.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.960
 It's from an anonymous source.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:13.680
 OK.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:14.800
 A whistleblower.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:15.920
 A deep throat.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.480
 Listen to this since 2016.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.560
 Confirming some facts mentioned in episode 488

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.480
 and also sharing a few unconfirmed facts

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.000
 about the Pentagon.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:24.600
 Mm, cool.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.880
 Bum, bum, bum.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.240
 We've got someone inside the building.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.640
 I'm a member of the US active military.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.600
 And was stationed at the Pentagon from 2014 to '18.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.960
 I saw firsthand the Pokemon Go craze

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.440
 as I was one of the participants.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:42.280
 The central courtyard was indeed a previous Pokemon Joe--

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.240
 Pokemon Go, Jim.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.160
 Have you just given away this guy's name?

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.840
 Oh, no.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:53.160
 It's Pokemon Joe, the 30th battalion.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.200
 And our source says, "Many folks during smoke breaks

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.720
 would sit on the park benches during the day

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.840
 to fight for control.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:02.280
 And I would sometimes see upwards of 100 people wandering

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.360
 or sitting, obviously playing, but trying

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:07.320
 to be inconspicuous about their intentions."

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.880
 100 people.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.000
 That really is amazing.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:10.840
 That's incredible.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:11.680
 I know.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.840
 A couple of other-- just a little bonus fact.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.120
 Because we talked about the tour guides walking backwards.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:17.620
 Yes.

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:18.880
 And keep an eye on everyone.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.840
 And they know the exact number of steps

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:25.200
 that they'll need to take in order to then cut a right

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.800
 without turning around and looking.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:27.520
 So clever.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:31.040
 Well, our source, Pokemon Joe, writes,

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.960
 "That is most likely true, although they always

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.440
 have someone also walking forward from the back

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.400
 to keep eyes on the entire group."

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.400
 OK.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.440
 I wondered with those guys, do they count the number of steps,

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.360
 Dan, did you say?

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.080
 Or they use landmarks.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.640
 So like a fire hydrant might suggest, OK, that's there.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:49.760
 I know that there is a--

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.440
 10 more steps backwards or whatever.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.920
 Because that's, of course, we learned a few years ago.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:57.800
 That's how ants managed to find their way back to the nests.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.160
 They count the number of steps.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.400
 And the reason-- and the way they found that out

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:05.600
 is they put little stilts on the ants.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.120
 And when they put the stilts on, they always overshot.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.840
 Because they count the number of steps.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.800
 But obviously, the stride is longer, so they missed the nest.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:13.560
 Yes.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.480
 So I was wondering if you were to put tour guides

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.920
 in the Pentagon in different highted shoes,

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.720
 whether it would completely throw them off.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.480
 Oh, yeah, that's a good test.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:23.760
 Pokemon Joe could maybe--

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:24.920
 oh, no, he's not there anymore.

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.160
 Pokemon Joe, get back in.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.720
 Pokemon Joe writes, "Happy to answer other questions

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:29.760
 within reason."

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:30.520
 Brilliant.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.840
 Would you say that one was within reason?

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:33.640
 Yeah, I do.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.280
 I do.

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:37.040
 Great.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:40.040
 Well, looks forward to reply next month.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.120
 Thank you, Joe.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.960
 Very quick one from Grant Winjones.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.240
 Loved Ella Alshama.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.480
 He's fascinating spiel on James Cameron.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.080
 Oh, yeah.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.360
 This is a week or two ago.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.720
 I was googling him and discovered

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.680
 that in addition to his engineering genius,

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.000
 he is also artistic.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.400
 He did the sketch of Kate Winslet in Titanic.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.040
 Did he?

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:56.480
 Yeah.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.200
 The new sketch of Kate Winslet.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.040
 I think that's a bit creepy, isn't it?

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.800
 Oh, the director is insisting that--

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.600
 I'm afraid he's the only one qualified to draw you naked

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.000
 for this bit of the film.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.040
 Sorry.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:08.760
 Yeah, that's true.

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:12.640
 Now, we should get on to it.

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.400
 We've actually got a proper correction

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.080
 to make, which is from something we've

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.440
 had a lot of correspondence about as well.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:24.200
 Sample email subject line, Wicca versus Satanist.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:27.280
 Another email subject line, Satanic temple info.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:28.920
 Why would Wicca's be against Satanist

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.280
 when they're exactly the same people?

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.600
 That doesn't make any sense.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.880
 Well, that's the funny thing, James.

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.080
 Yeah, absolutely.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:37.520
 So it turns out that they're really, really not.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.680
 And basically, we've had a lot of correspondence.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.200
 More like Satan isn't.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.440
 That was a very good email subject line there.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:47.160
 And basically, we slightly, I think, let the impression

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:50.360
 happen that Wicca and Satanism is the same thing,

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:53.480
 or that Wicca's enjoy a spot of devil worship.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.400
 And that's not true.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.880
 Can I ask, Andy, first of all, did you

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:00.400
 get any Satanists who were annoyed that they'd

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.560
 been compared to Wicca people?

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:03.480
 No.

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.400
 I got one person writing in saying these are different,

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.640
 and I'm neither.

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.920
 But no, I don't think any Satanists saying,

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.720
 I've just finished a spot of devil worship,

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:15.080
 and we're nothing like the neo-pagan religion of Wicca.

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.960
 OK, so are you going to quickly explain to us

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.840
 what Wicca is, just so that we--

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:22.200
 Yeah, here's a sample from one of our correspondence.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.600
 Wicca is a neo-pagan religion compiled

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.480
 by Gerald Gardner in the mid-20th century.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.800
 There are lots of other aspects of paganism, none of which

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.520
 contain Satanism, which is an ideological viewpoint,

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.640
 rather than the following of a full religion.

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:39.920
 So lots of clarification there.

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.440
 We're very happy to set the record straight.

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.360
 Wicca is a harmless nature-based religion,

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.600
 nothing to do with the devil.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:47.160
 OK.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.000
 Wow.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.360
 This is great news.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:50.920
 Yeah.

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:51.600
 Oh, is it?

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.720
 Oh, yeah, absolutely, because this

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:57.320
 is now going to be the new classical musicians don't

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.280
 need sheet music to play.

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.960
 It's as if I've planted this story just

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.320
 to take the heat off the correspondence on that

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.080
 coming in now.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:08.840
 So very excited for this mess up.

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.360
 Oh, no, we've got an email in.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.000
 It's from a Wiccan bassoonist.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 Yeah, so there we go.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.240
 We mustered it in the show, the slightly different things,

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.880
 but we could have made it very much clearer.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:24.040
 So apologies to all Wiccans listening.

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.080
 Who did get quite offended.

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:29.800
 So yeah, we are genuinely sorry, because it did raise a bit of--

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:33.000
 I guess it is one of those things that sometimes does

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.840
 get presented as if it has a connection,

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:36.920
 and it does bad for their reputation.

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:39.120
 It makes possibly in ways we don't appreciate.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.880
 Also, lots of the Satanists, we were to quote unquote Satanists

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:45.180
 we were talking about, are basically free speech campaigners.

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:48.960
 We mentioned very few people who actually worship the devil.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:52.200
 Is it the Satanic temple, who are the anti--

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:56.040
 they're anti-government libertarians who also take the Mechie.

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.840
 So anyway, I hope that's clear.

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:02.800
 Let's move on to another silly email.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.040
 Here's one from Andreas Marti on suffragettes.

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:08.280
 Last episode also, James mentioned--

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:09.920
 this is about the suffragette thing.

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.120
 Oh, it's about Swiss women getting the vote,

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.480
 and the year they get that.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.280
 So it's actually nothing to do with that topic.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:18.640
 It's another tombridge-tombridge.

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:21.360
 It's-- James mentioned the Canton--

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.040
 Appenzell--

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.320
 Appenzell, yeah.

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.720
 Alsurrodin, regarding the women's right to vote.

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:29.120
 James said it-- I'm just reading the email, James.

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:30.200
 I don't think it is.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:35.200
 But James said it as Alsurrodin, instead of the correct

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:39.280
 Alsurrodin, because the second word starts with the second r.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:43.080
 This is hilarious because, Andreas writes,

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:46.720
 "Hoden means testicles in German."

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:50.680
 So James said, "outer testicle," instead of "outer roger."

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:54.840
 I'm such a comedy genius that I could see that comedy.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:57.160
 I could see the word "testicle" in that word.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.440
 Even though I didn't know any German,

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.040
 I just knew it must be funny.

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:04.800
 I've got to imagine that the laugh that you have got over

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.680
 in Germany that we just no one else has got,

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:10.200
 you've created bilingual laughter.

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:14.160
 Everyone listening to the show in Appenzell,

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:18.160
 whatever testicles, they would have been just probably

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.640
 thousands, if not tens of thousands of people listening

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.640
 there will have just been loving it.

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:24.560
 It's huge.

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:25.520
 That's great.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:28.320
 And so anyway, I wrote to thank Andreas for that information.

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:31.560
 There's also an Appenzell inner rodent, inner testicle,

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.160
 inner Hoden.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:34.640
 So I just wrote saying, thank you.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.160
 We'll read that out on Drops Align.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:41.960
 And Andreas Marty then actuallyed himself unbelievable

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:45.280
 by saying, "By the way, Appenzell Also rodent

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:48.560
 "and Appenzell inner rodent are half cantons,

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:50.120
 "not full cantons.

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:53.080
 "Each one has only one seat in the upper house of parliament.

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.880
 "The former canton Appenzell split in two

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.760
 "during the reformation in 1597.

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.960
 "Inner rodent is Catholic while Also rodent is not."

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:01.800
 Right.

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.200
 'Cause I don't want to get more emails about that.

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.040
 That's about that.

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.000
 Brilliant.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.800
 So they're not cantons, they're canstons.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.600
 That's superb.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:13.680
 Yeah, I was just channeling the Wiccan joke from earlier on.

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:14.520
 Yeah.

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:15.360
 Love it.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.360
 Satan isn't.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.560
 Oh, there's one bit of corroboration that we got.

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:19.400
 Oh, lovely.

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:20.240
 That's nice to hear.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.200
 You were right, you were right.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.960
 Eversteena Pauli writes,

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:26.480
 "This is the longest distance callback of the week."

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:28.760
 That's a fun section we can run.

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:33.080
 I was listening to old episodes.

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.400
 I was delighted to hear a question I can answer.

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.440
 It was episode 127.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.280
 Great.

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:41.240
 Well, eight years ago, maybe, seven or eight years ago.

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:43.280
 Alex is on the show and he says,

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:45.360
 "Among all the things left on the moon are nail clippers.

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.240
 "Why would anyone bring nail clippers to space?"

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.080
 He asks.

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:48.920
 Oh, yeah.

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.800
 Well, nail clippers are actually crucial

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.440
 for any astronauts who prefer not to have

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:54.160
 their fingernails fall off.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:59.440
 Because you need to protect the astronauts' hands

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:01.400
 and the bulky and ill-fitting gloves can result

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:02.440
 in their fingernails falling off

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.880
 like the way runners might lose toenails.

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:08.440
 So, at least having well-trained nails is a necessity,

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:10.280
 especially for big-handed astronauts.

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:11.120
 Yeah.

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:14.200
 At least one astronaut has reportedly solved this issue

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.680
 by removing their own fingernails

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:19.360
 as a preventative measure before leaving for the ISS.

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:20.680
 Wow.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:21.760
 Wow.

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:22.680
 That's stunning.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:23.520
 Oh, my God.

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:24.600
 That's amazing.

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:27.360
 Yeah, because actually long-distance runners

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:30.760
 remove their toenails sometimes before races

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:34.160
 because it's less painful than them falling off

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.280
 by accident.

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.720
 And yeah, I have heard that about the gloves,

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:38.680
 at least the old gloves.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:40.120
 They're really solid.

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:43.160
 They're like, you know, almost like plastic tubes

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.160
 as opposed to just nice gloves.

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:46.000
 Right.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.080
 So, they aren't molded to your hands

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.080
 or the old ones weren't.

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.480
 And so, yeah, they would just be rattling around

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.640
 inside them all the time.

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.960
 And if they don't fit very well, that's going to happen.

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:55.800
 Wow.

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:57.480
 They're not like surgical, they're not like rubber gloves.

00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:00.240
 They're like big, thick, bulky, yeah, yeah.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.080
 Ever seen a race?

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.480
 This is how she knows it.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:03.320
 I love this.

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:05.240
 I fell into the rabbit hole of astronauts' nails

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.760
 and nail clippers when collaborating

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.360
 with a NASA engineer during my master's studies

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.960
 in industrial design in 2018.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.920
 His name is Douglas Wong, and he has been working

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.880
 on a zero-gravity nail clipper with suction

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:19.280
 that he is calling Nail Caps,

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:21.720
 the Nail Clipping's airborne prevention system.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.120
 The aim is to prevent nail clippings flying around the ISS

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.240
 and ending up getting in experiments

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:29.360
 and machinery or the astronauts' eyes or lungs.

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:30.200
 Yeah.

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:31.040
 That must be tough.

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.720
 You accidentally swallow someone's toenail clippings.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.760
 Someone else's toenail clippings as well.

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:36.600
 Yeah.

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:37.840
 You could just do your fellow astronauts

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:41.600
 just clipping their nails into the zero-gravity.

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:42.440
 Give us another one.

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.920
 All right, here's one.

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:45.160
 Oh, this is a great one.

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:46.720
 This is from Andres Kutt.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.920
 Andrea writes, "In episode 486 of Fish,

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:53.000
 you guys discussed passengers landing in aircraft.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.680
 It has also been covered on QI.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:55.920
 But did you know there is a place

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:59.040
 where passengers always land the plane?"

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.320
 Oh, that's really good.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:01.400
 Is it a quiz?

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.040
 Can we work it out?

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:05.120
 I think-- you probably could work it out, actually.

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:06.160
 You're very good at quizzes.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.360
 I didn't work it out.

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:07.860
 OK.

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:11.960
 So it must be some reason that the pilot can't do it.

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:12.460
 Yes.

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:16.740
 So perhaps there's no pilot on the plane normally.

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:19.760
 Perhaps the pilot--

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:22.280
 huh, the passengers--

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.000
 oh, I know it.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.280
 It's like, you know, in the Flintstones where they have cars

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:30.040
 and the legs come out of the bottom and they run along.

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:33.920
 There's some really old planes where the seats--

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.280
 like, your legs sort of dangle out of the bottom.

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.480
 And then as the plane comes into land,

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.240
 everyone has to run at the same time.

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.520
 Yeah, yeah, there's classic planes.

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:43.760
 There's classic planes with no flaws.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.000
 Is it-- he's got it.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.680
 He's got it.

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:49.000
 I think he's almost got it.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.280
 I think it is old planes.

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:51.600
 And I think it's those planes.

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.360
 And I think we've spoken about it on Fish Before, whereby

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.920
 the plane comes and basically, effectively,

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:59.240
 comes so slow and hovers that people

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.280
 pull the plane down from the outside.

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:02.200
 No.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:02.600
 What?

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:06.280
 I think that used to happen on air hangers in a--

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:07.480
 Where are the airships?

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:08.360
 Sorry, airships.

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:09.920
 Rather-- sorry, airships out at sea.

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:12.800
 You would-- yeah, people used to help the plane land

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:14.400
 by physically pulling it down.

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:15.840
 That's amazing.

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:16.280
 Wow.

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:18.520
 If true.

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:20.000
 I was hoping that was the answer,

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.080
 as if that would corroborate my--

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:22.960
 That's not it.

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:24.520
 --weird ass idea, I just said.

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:25.520
 This is current.

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:27.680
 Passengers land the plane.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.920
 It's a slight--

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:31.640
 Andres is playing a little bit.

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:32.120
 Ah.

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:33.240
 Is it pilot?

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:34.800
 Is it the word pilot?

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.840
 The pilot is called passenger.

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:38.680
 And so is his co-pilot.

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:39.680
 Right.

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:41.640
 You're right.

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.080
 It's not pilot for a boat.

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:44.360
 You pilot a boat, right?

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:45.440
 It's definitely planes.

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:46.080
 Oh, that's clever.

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.040
 And we're talking planes.

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.240
 There's no one on a boat here.

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:48.880
 We're talking planes.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:50.160
 Oh, this is such a good riddle.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.120
 I didn't realize it was this good a riddle.

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:52.960
 It's a riddle.

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:53.880
 Love the plane.

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:55.880
 Passengers land the plane.

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:56.960
 Shall I tell you?

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:58.320
 Yeah, you're going to have to tell us.

00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:59.360
 OK.

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:00.400
 All right, here we go.

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.640
 Andres writes, when I took a flight from Singapore

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:05.720
 to Paro via Kolkata, there was a guy sitting

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:08.760
 at the front of the airplane across the aisle from me.

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:09.960
 So a passenger, right?

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:10.200
 Yeah.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:14.120
 Just before landing, he stood up and went into the cockpit.

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:17.160
 It turns out that the landing in Paro is so tricky.

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:19.120
 I've been to a airport, Paro.

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:21.600
 Well, only the pilots of the Bhutan Royal

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.040
 Airline are allowed to do the landing.

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:27.320
 But for the rest of the flight, they are a passenger.

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:28.480
 That's really clever.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.440
 That's clever.

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.880
 I have been in that airport, Paro, in Bhutan.

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:33.640
 So you've had this experience.

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:34.920
 You went flying there.

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:35.600
 Yeah, I did.

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:42.360
 But I only flew from either Kathmandu or somewhere like that,

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:43.680
 somewhere in Nepal I flew from.

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:47.800
 So the same pilot took the whole journey.

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:48.280
 I'm pretty sure.

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:49.400
 Oh, I see.

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:52.040
 I think it'd be a great way to prank people.

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:53.360
 Yeah, yeah.

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:57.120
 Someone comes out of the cockpit and say, oh, my god.

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.960
 Can anyone fly or land a plane?

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:03.400
 Yeah, but you've just got some confident Twitter bro going,

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:04.640
 yeah, I could do it, mate.

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:06.160
 I could do it.

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:07.720
 And then he's going to have a big argument

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.920
 with the actual pilot, where the pilot's going, no, no.

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.160
 I actually am a pilot.

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:14.440
 The other guy's like, yeah, but I'm pretty confident.

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:15.560
 I feel like I could do it.

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:16.920
 I used to watch the Crypton Factor.

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:18.200
 How hard could it be?

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:20.920
 Also, sometimes on those smaller planes,

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:23.720
 the toilet happens to be right next to the cockpit door.

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.240
 You wouldn't want to misunderstand it,

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:28.360
 where someone's got up for a poo, opens the door of the pilot,

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:29.440
 and he's going, oh, come sit.

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:33.480
 Yeah, take us in, buddy.

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.440
 Yes, that's brilliant.

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:36.760
 And it's like a stag do.

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:39.440
 And as a joke, the stag has come dressed as a member

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:40.640
 of our Bhutanese Air Class.

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:47.160
 Anymore!

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.440
 Oh, my god.

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:50.120
 That's a brilliant question.

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:52.920
 Anymore of these kind of riddle me this.

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:53.440
 Yeah.

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.760
 That's really great.

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:55.560
 Riddle corner.

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.480
 I'm going to write it on my list of segments

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:59.200
 that we might have.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.440
 We've done get yourself off the hook.

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:02.000
 We've had an arm actually of the week.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.040
 We haven't had any spicy meat.

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.600
 Haven't had plug corner.

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.920
 It's been a very format light episode of Drop As A Line.

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.320
 Oh, god, despite the fact that the theory of everything else

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:13.560
 is still available in all shards.

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:14.000
 Weird.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.880
 We haven't mentioned it.

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:17.840
 Let's move on.

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.240
 Yeah, all right.

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:22.440
 OK, bye.

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:29.000
 Bye, everybody.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.880
 That was Drop As A Line.

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:34.400
 As always, it was a whole heap of fun.

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:38.400
 And if you-- well, you've already signed up.

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:39.760
 There's nothing more to sign up to.

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:43.600
 You've reached the end of the road in terms of your fiscal

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:44.440
 commitment to us.

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:46.360
 Please do not cancel your subscription

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:48.280
 as a result of the last 20 minutes.

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:48.840
 Exactly.

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:50.600
 That's what we should say every week.

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:51.880
 Don't take a step back.

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:54.200
 Just maintain your current level of involvement with us.

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:54.920
 We're so glad.

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.760
 We hope you've enjoyed it.

00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:57.520
 Thank you very much.

00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.520
 And we'll do another fun thing in a couple of weeks.

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:00.360
 And we'll see you then.

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:01.900
 Bye.

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:05.260
