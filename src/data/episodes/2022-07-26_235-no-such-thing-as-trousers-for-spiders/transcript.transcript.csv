00:00:00,00:00:21,"Hello and welcome to another episode of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"" a weekly podcast"
00:00:21,00:00:24,coming to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.
00:00:24,00:00:29,"My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with Anna Gisinski, James Harkin and Alex"
00:00:29,00:00:33,Bell and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite
00:00:33,00:00:39,facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.
00:00:39,00:00:43,"Starting with my fact this week, my fact is that a message in a bottle that was thrown"
00:00:43,00:00:50,off the Titanic as it was sinking was found one year later washed up on a shore in Ireland
00:00:50,00:00:54,only a few miles from the home of the man who threw it.
00:00:54,00:01:00,It's pretty extraordinary so this could be that he just dropped it on his way to the Titanic.
00:01:00,00:01:05,"So this was a 19 year old, he was called Jeremiah Burke, he was from Glenmeyer County"
00:01:05,00:01:12,Cork in Ireland and the way that they were able to verify the bottle because there's been
00:01:12,00:01:17,a lot of forgery bottles that were claimed to be so people trying to make money.
00:01:17,00:01:21,This bottle was a bottle of holy water that his mother had given to him a sort of good
00:01:21,00:01:26,luck thing and he used one of his own shoelaces to tie it up as he threw the letter and the
00:01:26,00:01:31,"bottle overboard saying this didn't fucking work, mum, they've sent me a better good luck"
00:01:31,00:01:33,charm next time.
00:01:33,00:01:39,"Yeah so the message has a date on it, it's slightly unclear so it could be the 10th, 12th, 13th."
00:01:39,00:01:43,We know that it's sunk on the morning of the 15th but so I don't know why he would have...
00:01:43,00:01:45,"Yeah, that doesn't make sense."
00:01:45,00:01:46,It's very odd.
00:01:46,00:01:49,I think at the best of times I don't necessarily know what data is straight away.
00:01:49,00:01:52,"I think as you're going down with a Titanic, maybe you're going..."
00:01:52,00:01:53,What date is it guys?
00:01:53,00:01:54,What date is it?
00:01:54,00:01:55,Oh yeah.
00:01:55,00:01:56,The person next to you is clean of dear life.
00:01:56,00:01:57,"Sorry, do you know what date is it?"
00:01:57,00:01:58,Is it Monday?
00:01:58,00:02:01,"But yeah, so this bottle washed up and I've looked at it on Google Maps."
00:02:01,00:02:05,It is literally just a couple of miles separate where the area of where they lived right to
00:02:05,00:02:11,this shore and it was found by a coachman who found it and I didn't get to the bottom of
00:02:11,00:02:15,"this bit of the story but presumably knew the area, knew the people in the area and thought"
00:02:15,00:02:21,"""Ah, this guy, you know, he's said ""Burk of Glenmare Cork, I know this family, I know the"
00:02:21,00:02:22,burks.
00:02:22,00:02:23,"I'm going to see if this is him."""
00:02:23,00:02:26,And so delivered it to the mother who a year later received this bottle.
00:02:26,00:02:29,You could argue that it was a hoax at the same time.
00:02:29,00:02:34,It's only been reported in the last few years properly again since it happened because
00:02:34,00:02:38,"they've been lending it to a museum so they didn't sell it, didn't go through auctions,"
00:02:38,00:02:40,it's been a family heirloom since.
00:02:40,00:02:43,"Yeah, I suppose the natural currents would take it there anyway, wouldn't it?"
00:02:43,00:02:44,I suppose so.
00:02:44,00:02:46,"Yeah, kind of the obvious place for it to end up."
00:02:46,00:02:50,"So where did the Titanic launch from Liverpool, was it?"
00:02:50,00:02:55,"It went from Southampton, then I think it went to France and then it went to Ireland and"
00:02:55,00:02:57,"its last stop off was in Ireland, I think."
00:02:57,00:02:58,Was it?
00:02:58,00:03:00,"I didn't know that, all right."
00:03:00,00:03:03,"But yeah, it was such a weird coincidence but it's so weird how many messages and bottles"
00:03:03,00:03:08,or maybe it's not weird how many messages and bottles do get tossed overboard and found
00:03:08,00:03:10,and there are so many great stories.
00:03:10,00:03:17,"So another really good message in bottle coincidence that I liked is that in April 2012, UK fisherman"
00:03:17,00:03:23,called Andrew Leeper was fishing near Shetland and he found a message in a bottle and it was
00:03:23,00:03:28,a note that had been dropped at sea in 1890 and it was one of those that wanted to investigate
00:03:28,00:03:33,ocean currents so oceanographers were always doing this to investigate where the messages
00:03:33,00:03:35,ended up to see what the ocean currents were like.
00:03:35,00:03:41,"Anyway, Andrew Leeper found this message in a bottle in 2012 and so it was and it was"
00:03:41,00:03:46,really nice because that meant it was the 315th to be put in that log started in 1890.
00:03:46,00:03:49,So 315 of those messages had been retrieved.
00:03:49,00:03:51,"And it's still going, the log is still, I think."
00:03:51,00:03:52,It's still keeping log going.
00:03:52,00:03:53,Oh my god.
00:03:53,00:03:55,"Some incredibly border searchers still sitting there, having this town."
00:03:55,00:03:56,"Yeah, desperately waiting."
00:03:56,00:03:57,Every 40 years.
00:03:57,00:04:02,But what I liked about this guy was that he then broke the record for that's the longest
00:04:02,00:04:06,weight anyone's ever had to read a message in a bottle and the previous record holder had
00:04:06,00:04:12,been his mate Mark Anderson who'd broken it in 2006 in the same boat.
00:04:12,00:04:13,So what?
00:04:13,00:04:14,How weird is that?
00:04:14,00:04:17,So he's friends with him and he did like Leeper didn't interview with the papers when he
00:04:17,00:04:21,"then broke his friend's record and he said, my friend Anderson is very unhappy that I've"
00:04:21,00:04:26,topped his record as Anderson never stopped bloody talking about it.
00:04:26,00:04:32,"And if anything screams hoax, I'm not suspicious of that one."
00:04:32,00:04:38,In 1954 I was just looking up other bottles that have been chucked in rather than found.
00:04:38,00:04:41,Guinness decided to do an advertising promotion.
00:04:41,00:04:48,"And they threw 50,000 bottles into the ocean with messages in Guinness bottles, which I find"
00:04:48,00:04:49,unbelievable.
00:04:49,00:04:51,So it's known as being Guinness's longest advertising campaign yet because they're still turning
00:04:51,00:04:52,up.
00:04:52,00:04:54,But I can't believe that would never be allowed today.
00:04:54,00:04:56,"I'm jumping 50,000 bottles in the ocean."
00:04:56,00:04:59,"It's illegal in a lot of places, yeah, well, it definitely is."
00:04:59,00:05:05,"So you'll get fined in Canada for $5,000 if you throw a bottle into the water."
00:05:05,00:05:09,We found this out because it was a story this year of a guy called Harold Hackett from Prince
00:05:09,00:05:11,Edward Island.
00:05:11,00:05:17,"And he's throwing an estimated 10,000 messages into the ocean since he started."
00:05:17,00:05:20,And he said he has to retire because he doesn't want to get arrested.
00:05:20,00:05:22,"Well, no, arrest it, but find."
00:05:22,00:05:23,"Yeah, yeah."
00:05:23,00:05:24,I don't know.
00:05:24,00:05:28,"If that's all his life meant to him, throwing messages in bottles into the ocean."
00:05:28,00:05:31,I have a limited sympathy with someone like it was my life dream to pollute the ocean.
00:05:31,00:05:35,I can't believe that the government is moving.
00:05:35,00:05:39,"In the 16th century, it was also illegal to open a bottle if you found it."
00:05:39,00:05:41,"Yeah, I never found evidence of that."
00:05:41,00:05:42,I think that's it.
00:05:42,00:05:43,Yeah.
00:05:43,00:05:45,Is this the whole Queen Victoria having a Queen Elizabeth?
00:05:45,00:05:49,"I'm sorry, Queen Elizabeth having an uncorker of messages."
00:05:49,00:05:52,I think she did have that because it's mentioned in a Victor Hugo novel.
00:05:52,00:05:56,"I think that was the first mention and that was like two, a hundred years later."
00:05:56,00:05:57,"Oh, okay."
00:05:57,00:05:58,"No, she can't have had an uncorker."
00:05:58,00:06:00,"But it's not, that's not at least a modern invention, is it?"
00:06:00,00:06:01,No.
00:06:01,00:06:04,"I think I think fate needs to exist, even if Victor Hugo is penning it."
00:06:04,00:06:05,That's true.
00:06:05,00:06:06,In his novel.
00:06:06,00:06:07,Yeah.
00:06:07,00:06:08,In his vicious novel.
00:06:08,00:06:11,"I don't know how many Victor Hugo novels you've read, but there is a lot of extremely"
00:06:11,00:06:14,"boring technical, true stuff there."
00:06:14,00:06:15,"I really, yeah."
00:06:15,00:06:19,"Naturally, you'll get like three chapters of the sewage systems of Paris, and so on like."
00:06:19,00:06:20,"Oh, okay."
00:06:20,00:06:21,"Oh, no."
00:06:21,00:06:23,James's resentment comes out about the fact that he's been reading the same Victor Hugo novel
00:06:23,00:06:24,for a year.
00:06:24,00:06:26,"Which is genuinely true, right?"
00:06:26,00:06:27,How is it going?
00:06:27,00:06:31,"If anyone here remembers was talking about Victor Hugo, it was probably about six months"
00:06:31,00:06:32,ago.
00:06:32,00:06:38,"Yeah, that was on our 2018 tour at like, and I'm still reading ""Lay Viserato""."
00:06:38,00:06:39,Yeah.
00:06:39,00:06:43,"With the latest sort of modern instance that I read of this uncorker, comes down to"
00:06:43,00:06:48,"a 1978 book called ""The 12 Million Dollar Note"" by Robert Crask in it."
00:06:48,00:06:51,"There's true stories, and then there are also hoax stories."
00:06:51,00:06:55,"And the thought is, is that this was in the book as a hoax story, but it got mixed up in"
00:06:55,00:06:57,all the reviews and so on when people were talking about this.
00:06:57,00:07:00,"It's a true story, and then this is a hoax, and that's why it's spread."
00:07:00,00:07:06,So the idea just to explain that she had an official uncorker of bottles because Queen Elizabeth
00:07:06,00:07:09,first didn't want anyone else uncorking bottles that contained secret information.
00:07:09,00:07:10,Yeah.
00:07:10,00:07:15,"It was found, wasn't it, that was thrown from a Navy ship, supposedly, that had military"
00:07:15,00:07:18,details that were very classified.
00:07:18,00:07:23,"As if anyone was throwing bottles over, they would often be people who were in the Navy"
00:07:23,00:07:27,"or doing official work for the government, right, checking out currents and stuff like that."
00:07:27,00:07:30,So they didn't want just anyone to be able to read them.
00:07:30,00:07:32,And I don't know.
00:07:32,00:07:35,"I know what you mean, and I think your right to be skeptical, and it's probably not true."
00:07:35,00:07:39,But I don't think it's necessarily true that we're saying that one person had this as his
00:07:39,00:07:41,only job or anything.
00:07:41,00:07:45,"It could be someone who was part of the Royal Household who also had this job, or…"
00:07:45,00:07:52,"It's Green of the Stool on the side, he's official uncorker of various royal things."
00:07:52,00:07:57,"Yeah, so this idea of doing scientific experiments for the sake of finding out ocean currents"
00:07:57,00:08:01,"and stuff by dropping messages in bottles in actually serves a purpose, which seems so"
00:08:01,00:08:02,weird to me.
00:08:02,00:08:07,"So there was this guy George Parker Bitter, who threw a thousand bottles into the North Sea"
00:08:07,00:08:12,"in 1906, and he promised a shilling reward for anyone who found the bottle and then sent"
00:08:12,00:08:14,"it back to him, saying exactly where they'd found it."
00:08:14,00:08:19,"And in fact, one woman found the last one in 2015, and she posted it back to the address."
00:08:19,00:08:23,"And the company in Plymouth, that was still monitoring it, had to then track down a shilling"
00:08:23,00:08:24,and all shilling.
00:08:24,00:08:29,"Right, looking on eBay and old anti-coing collectors to centre."
00:08:29,00:08:30,That's so funny.
00:08:30,00:08:35,"Actually, the first ever message in a bottle possibly might have been for that reason,"
00:08:35,00:08:40,"which was supposedly Greek philosopher Theo Frastus, who wanted to prove that the Mediterranean"
00:08:40,00:08:42,was fed by the Atlantic.
00:08:42,00:08:46,"And so he put bottles in the Atlantic and saw them go round the corner into the med, and"
00:08:46,00:08:47,he could prove that.
00:08:47,00:08:50,"Again, this is a slightly not sure if this is true or not."
00:08:50,00:08:53,"And did he leave a message saying, whoever finds us, can you tell me the location?"
00:08:53,00:08:54,"Pretty much, right?"
00:08:54,00:08:55,That's the idea.
00:08:55,00:08:56,That's cool.
00:08:56,00:08:58,"And he saw them go round the corner, did you see?"
00:08:58,00:09:02,"No, I think again, this is possibly not true, but he would have put them in the water,"
00:09:02,00:09:07,"and then there would have been, like, dance as a message, saying, ""Contact, Theo Frastus"
00:09:07,00:09:08,"on..."""
00:09:08,00:09:09,You know?
00:09:09,00:09:10,075.
00:09:10,00:09:12,075 out of the square happens.
00:09:12,00:09:17,"There was a thing on, like, the US government, noticals like, which said that a lot of the"
00:09:17,00:09:21,nautical maps we have now are based on those messages.
00:09:21,00:09:27,"So in the 1950s, I think loads of messages in bottles were put in the Gulf of Maine."
00:09:27,00:09:30,"And all the maps we have of, like, all the different ocean currents there, basically"
00:09:30,00:09:34,"based on where everyone picked all those messages up, and where, and, you know, then they sent"
00:09:34,00:09:35,"back saying, ""Hey, I'm here."
00:09:35,00:09:36,"I've just found this."""
00:09:36,00:09:38,And that's where a lot of ocean maps come from.
00:09:38,00:09:40,"And now we've got, like, satellite technology and stuff."
00:09:40,00:09:44,"Also, I think quite recently I'm sure we must have mentioned this, but there was all those"
00:09:44,00:09:49,"rubber ducks that fell off a tanker, and they floated around everywhere, and we got loads"
00:09:49,00:09:50,of data from that.
00:09:50,00:09:51,"Yeah, really?"
00:09:51,00:09:52,So that's still happening.
00:09:52,00:09:53,Yeah.
00:09:53,00:09:54,I think they still wash up every now and then.
00:09:54,00:09:55,"Yeah, they do."
00:09:55,00:09:56,Yeah.
00:09:56,00:09:57,I read an article.
00:09:57,00:10:02,"I read mental floss article all about messages and bottles, and then the article veers away"
00:10:02,00:10:06,"because this isn't technically a message and a bottle, but it's a pretty extraordinary story."
00:10:06,00:10:08,So I'm just going to read it anyway.
00:10:08,00:10:10,This happened in 2001.
00:10:10,00:10:14,"There was a girl called Laura Bucston, and she was coming up to 10 years old."
00:10:14,00:10:17,She released a red balloon into the air.
00:10:17,00:10:19,She lived in Stoke on Trent in England.
00:10:19,00:10:23,"And on the balloon, she wrote, ""Please return to Laura Bucston."""
00:10:23,00:10:25,"And on the other side of the balloon, she put her home address."
00:10:25,00:10:27,So they released it into the air.
00:10:27,00:10:28,It disappeared.
00:10:28,00:10:34,"A few weeks later, 140 miles away, the balloon hit a hedge when it came down."
00:10:34,00:10:40,And the person who picked it up saw the name and saw the address and immediately went what
00:10:40,00:10:44,the hell was going on and went to his neighbor because his neighbor had a daughter who was
00:10:44,00:10:47,10 years old who also had the name Laura Bucston.
00:10:47,00:10:51,"So it landed exactly with the same age, same name, the person."
00:10:51,00:10:54,"They got in contact, and they were saying, ""What amazing coincidence."
00:10:54,00:10:55,"Let's meet up."""
00:10:55,00:10:59,"So on the day of the meeting, the two girls, independently without having decided what"
00:10:59,00:11:01,"they were going to do, both came in the same outfit."
00:11:01,00:11:03,They both had a pink sweater and were wearing jeans.
00:11:03,00:11:04,jeans.
00:11:04,00:11:05,Oh my goodness.
00:11:05,00:11:06,Oh my goodness.
00:11:06,00:11:10,This is just collecting all the qubits that happened at the moment.
00:11:10,00:11:14,"They were both roughly the same height, which was like two girls the same age and roughly"
00:11:14,00:11:15,the same height.
00:11:15,00:11:17,So they were tall ten-year-olds.
00:11:17,00:11:18,So they were very surprised.
00:11:18,00:11:19,"Oh, you're a tall ten-year-old."
00:11:19,00:11:20,Tiny little qubits.
00:11:20,00:11:21,Yes.
00:11:21,00:11:22,No.
00:11:22,00:11:23,I like pizza.
00:11:23,00:11:24,They both had brown hair.
00:11:24,00:11:25,They wore it in the same style.
00:11:25,00:11:28,They both had three-year-old black Labrador retrievers.
00:11:28,00:11:33,"They both had a gray pet rabbit, not on them, they left them out."
00:11:33,00:11:39,"They both brought, they did bring their own guinea pigs, which were the same color, and"
00:11:39,00:11:42,had the same orange markings on their high quarters.
00:11:42,00:11:45,"This is mental floss, so I know it sounds like I'm reading an April fool's thing, but this"
00:11:45,00:11:46,is...
00:11:46,00:11:50,"But also, like, if that was in a local news story, I'm a journalist in a local news story"
00:11:50,00:11:51,and still come trend.
00:11:51,00:11:53,"I would go and go, ""Come on, give me some more."
00:11:53,00:11:54,What have you got?
00:11:54,00:11:55,"You have a dog?"""
00:11:55,00:11:56,Yeah.
00:11:56,00:11:57,Okay.
00:11:57,00:11:58,"What is on local, as well?"
00:11:58,00:11:59,"Yeah, exactly."
00:11:59,00:12:00,What color-haired does she have?
00:12:00,00:12:01,Brilliant.
00:12:01,00:12:02,Nice one.
00:12:02,00:12:03,Yeah.
00:12:03,00:12:04,Can I just say this?
00:12:04,00:12:05,I don't know why these two are being like this.
00:12:05,00:12:06,They must have woken up on the wrong side of their bed.
00:12:06,00:12:07,Because that does happen sometimes.
00:12:07,00:12:08,Sure.
00:12:08,00:12:09,"I mean, mental things."
00:12:09,00:12:11,I suppose you could say the law of large numbers means that there's enough things that happen
00:12:11,00:12:15,"in the world, which aren't coincidental, that some coincidental things do happen sometimes."
00:12:15,00:12:16,Yeah.
00:12:16,00:12:18,Thousands of lower boxers pick up fan balloons every day.
00:12:18,00:12:19,It does happen not to be wearing the same clothes.
00:12:19,00:12:24,But I thought we should still get excited by coincidences.
00:12:24,00:12:25,"I know it's like, ""Oh, this could happen anyway."""
00:12:25,00:12:26,It's still amazing.
00:12:26,00:12:27,Yeah.
00:12:27,00:12:31,"I think maybe we did get out of bed on the wrong side, but on the other hand, did you not"
00:12:31,00:12:35,when you're a kid release loads of balloons with notes on them and never get a single fucking
00:12:35,00:12:36,reply from anyone?
00:12:36,00:12:37,Yeah.
00:12:37,00:12:38,Is that what you're attempting now?
00:12:38,00:12:39,I'm never going to school.
00:12:39,00:12:40,Yeah.
00:12:40,00:12:43,It was a very common thing for people to do when I was a kid.
00:12:43,00:12:45,"We don't do any more because it's like bad for the environment, but they used to be really"
00:12:45,00:12:46,involved to do that.
00:12:46,00:12:47,Didn't they?
00:12:47,00:12:48,"Everyone, do you write a note on your thing?"
00:12:48,00:12:52,"We would use to go to Tiggies for our birthday every year, which is an Italian restaurant"
00:12:52,00:12:56,"in Bolton, and then we'd get a free balloon, and then we'd write a note on it."
00:12:56,00:12:57,Yeah.
00:12:57,00:12:58,"Yeah, same."
00:12:58,00:12:59,Every birthday party.
00:12:59,00:13:02,Some bastard in Bolton was shooting them down over there.
00:13:02,00:13:06,Did you really go to Scotland for shared with thousands of labels of dead balloons that James
00:13:06,00:13:07,Arkansas couldn't name one?
00:13:07,00:13:12,"There was one person, the one girl who did it and landed in the bag on the Buckingham Palace"
00:13:12,00:13:13,and the Queen Centre Park.
00:13:13,00:13:14,Did you remember that?
00:13:14,00:13:15,Did you?
00:13:15,00:13:16,She was called Elizabeth Windsor.
00:13:16,00:13:20,And she was 90-year-old girl from bookstore.
00:13:20,00:13:24,And they both turned out wearing crowns.
00:13:24,00:13:33,You've got a beefy to do.
00:13:33,00:13:39,"OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Alex."
00:13:39,00:13:44,My fact this week is that the original mastermind to chair was specially modified to have detachable
00:13:44,00:13:49,"arms, quote, ""in case a contender is too large to fit between them."""
00:13:49,00:13:54,"Oh, OK, so we're going to explain what mastermind is for non-British people."
00:13:54,00:13:58,"Yes, so it's a long-running quiz show."
00:13:58,00:14:00,It's been running since 1972.
00:14:00,00:14:02,It's a very like paired back quiz show.
00:14:02,00:14:06,"So it's a dark studio, you have a person asking questions, and you have four contestants,"
00:14:06,00:14:11,"and they each come up to a chair one at a time, and the chair is the kind of the famous symbol"
00:14:11,00:14:12,of the show.
00:14:12,00:14:16,"And each contestant is asked a specialist subject, so yeah, prepare a specialist subject."
00:14:16,00:14:21,"So if you know, for example, Titanic facts and everything about it, you would get quizzed"
00:14:21,00:14:25,"in a very quick space of time, everything about the Titanic and the more point to get you"
00:14:25,00:14:26,in.
00:14:26,00:14:27,It's like an expert quiz.
00:14:27,00:14:28,"Yeah, exactly."
00:14:28,00:14:33,"And it was based on a guy who was in the war, in Second World War, he was Nare F. Gunner,"
00:14:33,00:14:39,"and he was captured in Germany and questioned by the Germans, and it's kind of supposed to"
00:14:39,00:14:43,"be almost the same way that he felt at the time, which is you've got a big light on"
00:14:43,00:14:47,"you, they're asking you questions again and again and again, to kind of put you under as much"
00:14:47,00:14:48,pressure as possible.
00:14:48,00:14:49,Yeah.
00:14:49,00:14:51,"Yeah, his name was Bill Wright, and yeah, exactly that."
00:14:51,00:14:55,"He was a prisoner of war, and he thought, oh, this will make a great game show."
00:14:55,00:15:02,"He was being interrogated by the Nazis, and interestingly, he says in Germany, so you"
00:15:02,00:15:06,"were asked three questions, which is name, rank, and number."
00:15:06,00:15:11,"And that's still the thing that in Mastermind, it's name, occupation, and specialist subject."
00:15:11,00:15:15,"He took the rule of three that they, and he directly associates it with that."
00:15:15,00:15:19,"And when they started it, Magnus Magnuson, who is the original host of the show, and his"
00:15:19,00:15:23,"name is, he's Icelandic, so that's a nice, Icelandic name, Magnus Magnuson."
00:15:23,00:15:25,Do you know what his dad's name was?
00:15:25,00:15:26,"No, I don't."
00:15:26,00:15:27,What his dad's first name was.
00:15:27,00:15:28,Yeah.
00:15:28,00:15:29,It was not Magnus.
00:15:29,00:15:30,"No, so I changed it."
00:15:30,00:15:35,"Yeah, in Iceland, it's supposed to be your surname is son of your father, so my dad's"
00:15:35,00:15:37,"called Michael, so I should be James Michelson."
00:15:37,00:15:38,Right.
00:15:38,00:15:41,His father was called Anna.
00:15:41,00:15:42,"Seagrstein, wasn't he?"
00:15:42,00:15:43,Seagrstein.
00:15:43,00:15:48,"So he should have been Seagrsteinson, but actually his father was called Seagrstein Magnuson,"
00:15:48,00:15:52,"and in Scotland, of course, you have the same surname as your father, so he had to keep the"
00:15:52,00:15:53,same surname.
00:15:53,00:15:54,"Oh, okay."
00:15:54,00:15:55,Wow.
00:15:55,00:15:56,That's very interesting.
00:15:56,00:16:02,"So, yeah, so Magnus, usually you'd be a quiz host or, you know, you'd have a title like"
00:16:02,00:16:03,that.
00:16:03,00:16:06,"His title, when he was doing the show, was the interrogator, so that's what he was"
00:16:06,00:16:07,introduced at.
00:16:07,00:16:09,He was completely tied into his experience.
00:16:09,00:16:12,"And he was actually a Nazi as well, wasn't he, Magnus Magnuson?"
00:16:12,00:16:13,"He was, yeah."
00:16:13,00:16:14,Was he?
00:16:14,00:16:15,No.
00:16:15,00:16:16,Geez.
00:16:16,00:16:17,"No, he was a national treasure."
00:16:17,00:16:19,"I thought I missed that paragraph, and I was reading it to this."
00:16:19,00:16:22,"You don't know what's weird, though, is that another little link in that I know from"
00:16:22,00:16:24,our friend who was on Mastermind.
00:16:24,00:16:29,"So Ian Dunn, who's a big fan of QI, and who we know, he went on Mastermind, and he said,"
00:16:29,00:16:33,"""When you fill in the forms, when you're saying what your specialist subject should"
00:16:33,00:16:35,"be, it's called the Mastermind SS form."
00:16:35,00:16:36,"They have a stop."""
00:16:36,00:16:38,That's very funny.
00:16:38,00:16:43,"I read on Wikipedia, they have a list of a few subjects that have actually been rejected."
00:16:43,00:16:47,A few of the ones that have been rejected include Roots to Anywhere in Mainland Britain by
00:16:47,00:16:50,Road from Letchworth.
00:16:50,00:16:54,"The banana industry, not allowed to pick the banana industry, as you're..."
00:16:54,00:16:56,Not allowed to pick it.
00:16:56,00:16:57,Nice.
00:16:57,00:17:01,A orthopedic bone cement in total hip replacement is another.
00:17:01,00:17:07,The last word of the wiki is Perfect Squares up to 99 Squared.
00:17:07,00:17:09,What is a Perfect Squared on?
00:17:09,00:17:17,"It's 9,801, but that's one point."
00:17:17,00:17:22,"In recent years, I read in an article that subjects like faulty towers, black adder, rolled"
00:17:22,00:17:28,"dull, harry potter, so they've been ruled out because so many people have picked it that"
00:17:28,00:17:30,"they've run out of questions, basically."
00:17:30,00:17:33,They don't know what else to ask about black adder that's not been done before.
00:17:33,00:17:39,"The thing with harry potter is that last year, 262 people wanted to do it as a specialist"
00:17:39,00:17:44,"subject on Mastermind, that's according to producer Mark Helzby."
00:17:44,00:17:48,"The first three winners were women, which was quite bizarre because far fewer women than"
00:17:48,00:17:54,"men have ended up winning the titles, not because women are less clever because of centuries"
00:17:54,00:17:57,and centuries of systemic oppression blah blah blah.
00:17:57,00:18:07,"I would say that your specialist subjects is not fabulous, look, I believe it, it's just"
00:18:07,00:18:09,a long explanation to go into.
00:18:09,00:18:13,"But yeah, the first three people who won were women and then in 35 years, it's been eight"
00:18:13,00:18:17,"women and 21 men who won it, but after the first three years, everyone was speculating"
00:18:17,00:18:20,is a man ever going to win Mastermind.
00:18:20,00:18:22,Can we talk about the chair very quickly?
00:18:22,00:18:23,Yes.
00:18:23,00:18:30,"The chair was voted in a survey for House Beautiful magazine as the second greatest chair, basically,"
00:18:30,00:18:31,of pop culture.
00:18:31,00:18:33,Or can we guess the first?
00:18:33,00:18:35,"Yeah, have a go, yeah."
00:18:35,00:18:40,"Just one extra bit of context, this is, it was voted as the second most iconic chair of"
00:18:40,00:18:41,the 20th century.
00:18:41,00:18:44,"I was going to say the wool second, the house of lords or whatever it is."
00:18:44,00:18:46,Is it a sofa from friends?
00:18:46,00:18:47,"No, it's not."
00:18:47,00:18:48,"Okay, so it's..."
00:18:48,00:18:49,"Is it in pop culture, right?"
00:18:49,00:18:50,Is it chair?
00:18:50,00:18:51,The singer.
00:18:51,00:18:52,"No, it's in."
00:18:52,00:18:55,"Okay, so I'm going to say it's the 1960s."
00:18:55,00:19:00,It is a chair that made the newspapers because it was a scandalous...
00:19:00,00:19:01,Nixon.
00:19:01,00:19:03,"It was a scandalous chair, basically."
00:19:03,00:19:04,Scandalist chair.
00:19:04,00:19:05,Elvis.
00:19:05,00:19:06,Elvis.
00:19:06,00:19:07,Did he have a chair?
00:19:07,00:19:08,Didn't need it.
00:19:08,00:19:09,So if you just had Elvis in it.
00:19:09,00:19:10,"He died on the toilet, yeah."
00:19:10,00:19:11,They often call it the throne.
00:19:11,00:19:12,Yeah.
00:19:12,00:19:13,That's true.
00:19:13,00:19:14,"Well, no."
00:19:14,00:19:16,Is it the chair that Liza Monelli sat on in that film?
00:19:16,00:19:17,Is that 1960s?
00:19:17,00:19:21,"No, it's not, but it's interesting, have a think in your head about what she does with"
00:19:21,00:19:24,that chair and you might get to it somehow.
00:19:24,00:19:25,Is it Chicago?
00:19:25,00:19:26,You're thinking...
00:19:26,00:19:27,She sits backwards.
00:19:27,00:19:29,Does someone sit backwards on it in an iconic photo?
00:19:29,00:19:30,We are so close.
00:19:30,00:19:31,Is it Marilyn Monroe?
00:19:31,00:19:32,"No, that's it."
00:19:32,00:19:33,"No, it's Christine Keeler."
00:19:33,00:19:34,"Yeah, we go Profumo."
00:19:34,00:19:35,Profumo.
00:19:35,00:19:36,"Yes, one of those."
00:19:36,00:19:37,Nice.
00:19:37,00:19:42,"Yeah, so that got voted the Christine Keeler sitting backwards on a chair as the most iconic."
00:19:42,00:19:45,Very much that was more about Keeler than the chair.
00:19:45,00:19:50,"Except in its time, most comedians would parody that shot and still do of being"
00:19:50,00:19:53,naked on a chair that way round in reference to that.
00:19:53,00:19:56,I think for that reason that chair is the concept of the chair.
00:19:56,00:19:57,"Yeah, exactly."
00:19:57,00:20:01,"I can picture the picture you're talking about, which I think means it counts."
00:20:01,00:20:02,We'll allow it.
00:20:02,00:20:07,So the last chair on Mastermind was given to Magnus Magnus and when he retired.
00:20:07,00:20:11,"They've got a new one now, which like Alex says, has these detachable arms."
00:20:11,00:20:13,It is an Eames soft pad.
00:20:13,00:20:19,"It was designed in 1969 and it was designed by Charles and Ray Eames, who are basically"
00:20:19,00:20:22,the best chair designers in the history of the world.
00:20:22,00:20:24,He's like Trumpish of you.
00:20:24,00:20:25,Yeah.
00:20:25,00:20:26,I have his chairs.
00:20:26,00:20:27,They make great chairs.
00:20:27,00:20:28,They are the famous.
00:20:28,00:20:29,They're the big names in chairs.
00:20:29,00:20:34,They were a husband and wife couple and they made loads of mass-produced chairs.
00:20:34,00:20:38,And the first thing they ever mass-produced was a molded plywood leg splint for World
00:20:38,00:20:44,"War II, which they gave to all the soldiers and it was molded on Charles' own leg."
00:20:44,00:20:47,"And they sold 150,000 of them."
00:20:47,00:20:51,So there were soldiers all around the world walking on an exact replica of his own leg.
00:20:51,00:20:52,Wow.
00:20:52,00:20:53,That's amazing.
00:20:53,00:20:54,That's incredible.
00:20:54,00:21:01,My favorite TV chair is the chair that was in the audition room when Robin Williams went
00:21:01,00:21:06,audition for the role of Mork from Ork on Happy Days.
00:21:06,00:21:09,"So I think that spun off into Mork and Mindy, didn't it?"
00:21:09,00:21:13,But the producer was a guy called Gary Marshall and Robin Williams came into the room and
00:21:13,00:21:16,"he was unknown at the time, walked in and Gary Marshall was told him to take a seat"
00:21:16,00:21:20,and immediately Robin Williams went to the chair and stood on his head on it and Marshall
00:21:20,00:21:23,"immediately hired him, saying he was the only alien who applied for the job, so."
00:21:23,00:21:24,Wow.
00:21:24,00:21:25,It's cool.
00:21:25,00:21:29,Those stories are quite dangerous because it encourages literally everyone to go into
00:21:29,00:21:31,audition and really break the mold.
00:21:31,00:21:34,And can you imagine saying that for hours after every single person comes in and does something
00:21:34,00:21:36,really annoying with the chair?
00:21:36,00:21:38,You're the only one who sat on the chair.
00:21:38,00:21:39,That was the test.
00:21:39,00:21:40,Do you want to tell you?
00:21:40,00:21:41,We're not looking for actual aliens.
00:21:41,00:21:42,We need an actor.
00:21:42,00:21:46,"We need somebody who's going to be easy to work with, to do the same form as time after time"
00:21:46,00:21:56,and love will take.
00:21:56,00:21:57,Okay.
00:21:57,00:22:00,It is time for fact number three and that is Chazinski.
00:22:00,00:22:04,My fact this week is that one competition at the Highland Games used to be pulling the
00:22:04,00:22:07,legs off a cow in order to win a sheep.
00:22:07,00:22:11,"Therfs really hard in Scotland out late because when I was at school, I used to pull legs"
00:22:11,00:22:15,"off a daddy long legs, but in Scotland they pull legs off a cow."
00:22:15,00:22:20,"It sounds like a metaphor for like ruining something because a cow is more valuable than a sheep,"
00:22:20,00:22:22,so why don't you just keep the cow and leave the legs on?
00:22:22,00:22:25,"So the cow is dead at this point, I should say."
00:22:25,00:22:28,"So it's not as awful, still quite awful."
00:22:28,00:22:29,"Yeah, it's pretty pretty, really bad."
00:22:29,00:22:30,It's not ideal.
00:22:30,00:22:33,It's a strength test and it would be impressive if someone could twist the legs off a cow
00:22:33,00:22:34,with his own bare hands.
00:22:34,00:22:37,So emotional strength test as well to witness what you've just done to this poor cow?
00:22:37,00:22:42,If you ever see Anna in the country side and you want to impress her.
00:22:42,00:22:53,"This was actually invented in 1820 and I don't think it was that long-lasting, but the idea"
00:22:53,00:22:57,of the contest was invented by a guy called Alistair McDonnell who was a clan chief and apparently
00:22:57,00:23:03,"he was just this really cool eccentric, vibrant clan chiefed in character."
00:23:03,00:23:08,"In fact, he was the character of Fergus McIver in the Waverly, Walter Scott's Waverly novel"
00:23:08,00:23:12,"was based on and yeah, he said let's do this, that'll be fun and the first prize is a fat"
00:23:12,00:23:13,sheep.
00:23:13,00:23:14,Okay.
00:23:14,00:23:18,And the reason it didn't last probably is because it was extremely difficult.
00:23:18,00:23:19,Yes.
00:23:19,00:23:24,"I read one, I don't think it might have happened maybe once or twice in one or two different"
00:23:24,00:23:29,"ones, but the one that I read was in Invergari and there was only one man who succeeded after"
00:23:29,00:23:35,struggling for about an hour as a reward he received his sheep and the eulogistic speech
00:23:35,00:23:37,from the chief.
00:23:37,00:23:38,Nice.
00:23:38,00:23:39,Has anyone been to the Highland games?
00:23:39,00:23:40,No.
00:23:40,00:23:41,I have been.
00:23:41,00:23:42,"Yeah, it's really awesome."
00:23:42,00:23:43,It's really good.
00:23:43,00:23:44,It's almost like a fate.
00:23:44,00:23:49,"The one that I went to is like a village fate, but then you've also got these incredible"
00:23:49,00:23:54,"things happening where people throw in these massive weights really, really high."
00:23:54,00:23:55,Like really high.
00:23:55,00:24:01,"The big logs, the big, I saw the paper tossing, the main one I saw, they were like, they had"
00:24:01,00:24:05,"these kind of, you know, like kettlebells that you would use in the gym and we're throwing"
00:24:05,00:24:08,"this over a big, big, big, high height."
00:24:08,00:24:09,Wow.
00:24:09,00:24:10,I was really impressed.
00:24:10,00:24:12,Is it kind of like high jump?
00:24:12,00:24:13,Is there a bar?
00:24:13,00:24:14,Yeah.
00:24:14,00:24:16,So we get higher and higher and higher at the time.
00:24:16,00:24:18,And the paper toss is not about how far you can toss it.
00:24:18,00:24:23,"It's about, you have to toss it so that it lands at 12 o'clock so it lands upright."
00:24:23,00:24:27,So it's got to stay up in the air for like an hour and a half who's jumping in the morning.
00:24:27,00:24:29,Depending on time you throw it.
00:24:29,00:24:31,Don't throw it at 9 a.m.
00:24:31,00:24:36,"It's not, yeah, as in it lands, like, facing away from you, is it worth it?"
00:24:36,00:24:37,Yes.
00:24:37,00:24:40,"So you need to do a full rotation of 180 and then land exactly facing away from you, don't"
00:24:40,00:24:41,land.
00:24:41,00:24:42,"Exactly, perpendicular to the earth."
00:24:42,00:24:43,Yes.
00:24:43,00:24:47,"Ah, so it would be extremely hard to pull the leg off a cow, right?"
00:24:47,00:24:49,I think they'd twisted.
00:24:49,00:24:51,People tend to say twist quite a lot.
00:24:51,00:24:52,"And is that, is that how you pull it?"
00:24:52,00:24:54,"I think that is how you would do it, yeah."
00:24:54,00:24:55,I think so.
00:24:55,00:24:57,Let's say you want to pull a chicken leg off a chicken.
00:24:57,00:24:58,Yeah.
00:24:58,00:25:00,"You tend to give it a twist while you're pulling, don't you?"
00:25:00,00:25:02,"I can see what you're saying, actually."
00:25:02,00:25:03,I can picture that now.
00:25:03,00:25:06,Do you know the ideal shape for a cow right in the 19th century?
00:25:06,00:25:08,"We've got four legs for us, don't we?"
00:25:08,00:25:12,"Well, unless it's kind of square because I can't really picture cows because I can't"
00:25:12,00:25:13,picture anything.
00:25:13,00:25:16,"But if I ever had to draw one, I'd draw it particularly square for an animal, right?"
00:25:16,00:25:22,"And that's, if you picture drawings in the 19th century, then cows would be vast and very"
00:25:22,00:25:23,square.
00:25:23,00:25:27,And there was a lot of competition between members of the ability and landowners about getting
00:25:27,00:25:29,the right shape of your animals.
00:25:29,00:25:31,"So yeah, if you look at cows, they don't look like real cows."
00:25:31,00:25:37,"And the actual, the size of a cow between 1710 and 1795 increased by a third."
00:25:37,00:25:38,So people were really building up their cows.
00:25:38,00:25:40,"Sorry, what were the dates?"
00:25:40,00:25:41,Between 1710 and 1795.
00:25:41,00:25:42,So that was when they started getting bigger.
00:25:42,00:25:44,So it's only a couple of generations.
00:25:44,00:25:45,"Yeah, absolutely."
00:25:45,00:25:49,But cows were supposed to be rectangular.
00:25:49,00:25:50,Exactly rectangular.
00:25:50,00:25:54,"Sheep were supposed to tend towards being oblong and pigs, the ideal shape for a pig was"
00:25:54,00:25:55,a football shape.
00:25:55,00:25:57,"Well, what kind of football?"
00:25:57,00:26:02,"As in, in those days was F.A. regulation standards, black and white and eggs again."
00:26:02,00:26:03,I think round.
00:26:03,00:26:06,"So if you get pictures of pigs very often, they'll be the picture with their stomachs"
00:26:06,00:26:07,literally on the floor.
00:26:07,00:26:08,Like a potbelly pig.
00:26:08,00:26:11,"Because they've actually been to turn them into footballs, didn't they?"
00:26:11,00:26:12,"Yeah, exactly."
00:26:12,00:26:13,"Pigs, butters."
00:26:13,00:26:14,Yeah.
00:26:14,00:26:15,So why were the cows square?
00:26:15,00:26:17,"Because usually when you make things square, it's that you can stack them."
00:26:17,00:26:19,But I don't think they did that in a cow.
00:26:19,00:26:20,A bit more in a little.
00:26:20,00:26:21,Yeah.
00:26:21,00:26:23,"Well, this was just getting them bigger."
00:26:23,00:26:25,And that was the shapes they tended towards.
00:26:25,00:26:31,"I read, just going back to the history of the Scotland Highland Games."
00:26:31,00:26:35,"I read that the very first one, so they don't know exactly where the first one occurred."
00:26:35,00:26:42,But it is believed that one of the first early venues was at Fettoreso.
00:26:42,00:26:47,"And technically, it's a few miles south of the Scottish Highlands."
00:26:47,00:26:48,So the first one made no sense.
00:26:48,00:26:49,So the lowlands.
00:26:49,00:26:50,It's in the lowlands.
00:26:50,00:26:52,So it's actually the lowland games.
00:26:52,00:26:54,That's a really good find to history.
00:26:54,00:26:55,If it's true.
00:26:55,00:26:56,Yeah.
00:26:56,00:27:00,"Unfortunately, as the article says, if it did happen there, it predates recorded history."
00:27:00,00:27:01,We'll never know.
00:27:01,00:27:07,"Because really the first one, which is kind of a modern style, was in Brema in the early"
00:27:07,00:27:12,1800s. And it came at a time when the Scottish were kind of finding themselves.
00:27:12,00:27:15,"And that's when all that kind of tartan, it did exist."
00:27:15,00:27:18,But it was when it was properly became like this in the last five days.
00:27:18,00:27:21,But it's quite an informal type thing.
00:27:21,00:27:22,There aren't the Highland Games.
00:27:22,00:27:25,Or there weren't the Highland Games right at the same time.
00:27:25,00:27:27,"It's, yeah, it's more just like a festival type thing, isn't it?"
00:27:27,00:27:28,Yeah.
00:27:28,00:27:29,Yeah.
00:27:29,00:27:30,Various times over the summer.
00:27:30,00:27:31,Every place will have one.
00:27:31,00:27:32,And it's weird.
00:27:32,00:27:33,It's not just these like any time I've thought of it.
00:27:33,00:27:34,I've thought of throwing these giant logs.
00:27:34,00:27:37,"And as you say, the kettlebell style weights."
00:27:37,00:27:41,"But they do stuff like biggest bowl of porridge, you know, as a competition."
00:27:41,00:27:48,"And there was one that was made in 2010, that's the record, which is, it was 690 litres of"
00:27:48,00:27:49,porridge.
00:27:49,00:27:50,So it was 2000 people.
00:27:50,00:27:54,"It was just by Goldilocks, who said, ""This porridge is too small."""
00:27:54,00:27:55,So yeah.
00:27:55,00:27:58,"But it's all tourist as well, isn't it?"
00:27:58,00:27:59,Yeah.
00:27:59,00:28:01,No Scottish people have ever been to the Highland Games.
00:28:01,00:28:05,"And you know who, well, you know who used to go to it, Billy Conley all the time."
00:28:05,00:28:09,"And as a result, he used to bring his best mates along, who happened to be famous comedians"
00:28:09,00:28:10,as well.
00:28:10,00:28:15,"One of which, who went, was Robin Williams, just to bring all the alien chairman back into"
00:28:15,00:28:16,the conversation.
00:28:16,00:28:17,Yeah.
00:28:17,00:28:28,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is James."
00:28:28,00:28:34,My fact this week is that you can cure your arachnophobia by drawing pictures of smiling
00:28:34,00:28:35,spiders.
00:28:35,00:28:36,So good.
00:28:36,00:28:37,I'm actually going to try this.
00:28:37,00:28:38,Can you read the full book?
00:28:38,00:28:39,Yeah.
00:28:39,00:28:40,"Yeah, me too."
00:28:40,00:28:44,"Do you need to draw like a, like a, like a nude, like a life model kind of, do you need"
00:28:44,00:28:45,the spider there?
00:28:45,00:28:50,"Well, they are always usually nude spiders, because they can't, they can't get trousers without"
00:28:50,00:28:51,legs.
00:28:51,00:28:53,"So he drew like a sexy photo of a spider, with that make it less scary?"
00:28:53,00:28:54,Like a profumo sitting on a chair.
00:28:54,00:28:58,He had four legs every time.
00:28:58,00:29:02,So this is a clinical hypnotherapist called Adam Cox.
00:29:02,00:29:08,"He is British, or he pretends he's in Britain, and he encourages his clients to draw brightly"
00:29:08,00:29:13,"coloured, smiling spiders with big eyes, and he says that it reduces their feelings of"
00:29:13,00:29:15,anxiety towards the arachnids.
00:29:15,00:29:21,"But so does it cure you in a, you're, presumably it's not like, okay, I'm going to be encountering"
00:29:21,00:29:23,a spider in the next five minutes.
00:29:23,00:29:25,I'm going to quickly draw a picture of a smiling one too.
00:29:25,00:29:29,"No, it's a long-term therapy, so people are going week after week and drawing more and"
00:29:29,00:29:30,more spiders.
00:29:30,00:29:32,And eventually it makes them feel less anxious.
00:29:32,00:29:37,"It maybe sounds like the early stages of a very severe phobia treatment, so as in you can't"
00:29:37,00:29:39,"even, because you know there are some phobias where you can't even say the word of the thing"
00:29:39,00:29:43,"you're scared of, and the idea of drawing a spider is probably really scary and horrible"
00:29:43,00:29:45,and thinking about the details of it is probably part of it.
00:29:45,00:29:49,"Well, I am an arachnid phobia, a little bit not as much as I used to be as a kid, but I would"
00:29:49,00:29:54,"always find it really hard to see a picture of them in a book, and even now on the internet"
00:29:54,00:29:55,I find it quite hard.
00:29:55,00:29:56,I have to scroll past them.
00:29:56,00:29:57,Me too.
00:29:57,00:29:58,Really?
00:29:58,00:30:00,"Yeah, just get it out of shot and just read the text."
00:30:00,00:30:04,How do you have to research this background?
00:30:04,00:30:08,So what's interesting as well as there was a study that was done in Queensland in Australia
00:30:08,00:30:13,and along with a UK university in Sussex.
00:30:13,00:30:17,"And they were saying that if you have a fear of spiders, if you have arachnophobia, you"
00:30:17,00:30:23,"are more likely to see a spider as in your hardwired, as they say, to notice the threats."
00:30:23,00:30:27,"So if you were out in Queensland and you were walking through the bush, if I'm walking"
00:30:27,00:30:31,"with you and I'm less scared, I might not see a spider that's obviously there, but you"
00:30:31,00:30:33,are on edge waiting to see one.
00:30:33,00:30:36,"Yeah, actually, that's almost logical."
00:30:36,00:30:40,"I do have a problem with movement in general, so if I see any movement out the corner of"
00:30:40,00:30:42,"my eye, it really freaks me out."
00:30:42,00:30:47,"And the reason they, their movement is particularly weird, because I think we mentioned recently,"
00:30:47,00:30:51,"actually, how they move by hydraulic pressure, but I don't realise it was all spiders moving"
00:30:51,00:30:52,that way.
00:30:52,00:30:55,"So when they stretch their legs out, they're not doing it with their muscles at all."
00:30:55,00:30:58,"They're pumping blood out through their legs, which is why they move in that weird jerky"
00:30:58,00:30:59,way.
00:30:59,00:31:04,"And that's why when they die, they always shrivel up, because the pressure disappears, so they"
00:31:04,00:31:05,shrivel up.
00:31:05,00:31:09,"So basically, when they run, they have to have an erection in every one of their legs."
00:31:09,00:31:10,"That's exactly it, yeah."
00:31:10,00:31:11,Wow.
00:31:11,00:31:13,It's very quickly getting harder than not getting harder.
00:31:13,00:31:14,Exactly.
00:31:14,00:31:15,Yeah.
00:31:15,00:31:20,"Their genitals are hydraulic as well, by the way, so they operate with some hydraulic pressure."
00:31:20,00:31:23,"And also, they obviously have this really cool thing spider penises where they can keep"
00:31:23,00:31:25,on having sex without the spider.
00:31:25,00:31:30,"So there are quite a few spiders, like the all-web spider, which will start having sex with"
00:31:30,00:31:34,"a lady spider, and then detaches its penis to get away, because I was a football."
00:31:34,00:31:35,Have to take a call.
00:31:35,00:31:37,"I'm so sorry, I'll be back in a minute."
00:31:37,00:31:38,You have this.
00:31:38,00:31:39,Exactly.
00:31:39,00:31:43,And it's actually more effective without its spider attachment.
00:31:43,00:31:48,"As soon as the spider leaves, the penises tend to eject about 70% of their sperm after"
00:31:48,00:31:49,that.
00:31:49,00:31:50,So they keep pumping sperm out.
00:31:50,00:31:51,Wow.
00:31:51,00:31:52,Even when the spider's gone.
00:31:52,00:31:53,Wow.
00:31:53,00:32:00,"I was looking into general phobias, because obviously there are so many phobias out there, and I found"
00:32:00,00:32:04,"this long list just to see which ones are actual phobias, because there must be a phobia for"
00:32:04,00:32:08,"everything, but there's a limitation, obviously, on ones that have been given names."
00:32:08,00:32:09,Yeah.
00:32:09,00:32:13,So the ones that I found that I thought were quite interesting that have actual names
00:32:13,00:32:14,assigned to them.
00:32:14,00:32:17,There's a phobia for the fear of opinions.
00:32:17,00:32:19,That's very interesting.
00:32:19,00:32:20,I'm just fearful.
00:32:20,00:32:23,I'm just really sure what I think about that.
00:32:23,00:32:24,There is the fear of flutes.
00:32:24,00:32:30,"When you say there is, as in a guy on the internet, decide to attribute names to one of the"
00:32:30,00:32:31,fears.
00:32:31,00:32:34,"No, so this is a big list that a guy wrote."
00:32:34,00:32:35,Phobia.
00:32:35,00:32:39,"Not Wikipedia is called something like phobia, weirdphobias.com was something like that."
00:32:39,00:32:43,"I think that's a really difficult thing, isn't it, because there's a list of millions"
00:32:43,00:32:44,of them.
00:32:44,00:32:47,There's like someone wrote one about a fear of a doc secretly looking at you or something
00:32:47,00:32:49,"like that, which is obviously not true."
00:32:49,00:32:52,"Then on the other hand, there are such weird ones that are true."
00:32:52,00:32:55,It's really hard to tell which ones are enough.
00:32:55,00:32:57,"So, like, phobia is definitely a thing."
00:32:57,00:32:58,Is it?
00:32:58,00:32:59,Being scared of ferns.
00:32:59,00:33:01,I think quite a few famous people have got that.
00:33:01,00:33:03,"Furn cotton, which is very difficult for her."
00:33:03,00:33:04,Yeah.
00:33:04,00:33:05,I think she's scared of cotton as well.
00:33:05,00:33:06,Yeah.
00:33:06,00:33:08,And fear of like holes and stuff like that is really common.
00:33:08,00:33:09,Yes.
00:33:09,00:33:10,I've heard of that one.
00:33:10,00:33:11,I've heard of that one.
00:33:11,00:33:12,I've heard of that one.
00:33:12,00:33:13,I've heard of fear of chins.
00:33:13,00:33:14,Do you reckon that's a real one?
00:33:14,00:33:15,It's hard to imagine.
00:33:15,00:33:16,But that's what I mean.
00:33:16,00:33:17,It's hard to say whether it isn't.
00:33:17,00:33:18,Yeah.
00:33:18,00:33:21,"You know, a guy had his arachnophobia accidentally removed quite recently."
00:33:21,00:33:27,"So, you can get rid of accidentally, but it does involve really invasive surgery."
00:33:27,00:33:29,This was a guy who'd always been terrified of spiders.
00:33:29,00:33:33,And then also he got an illness where he started having seizures.
00:33:33,00:33:36,"And so he went in for an operation to get rid of his seizures, and they had to remove"
00:33:36,00:33:37,a bit of his amygdala.
00:33:37,00:33:42,"And the surgery went really well, but he woke up and he found just two slight changes to"
00:33:42,00:33:43,his character.
00:33:43,00:33:47,He had this stomach-lurching aversion to a very specific kind of music.
00:33:47,00:33:49,"So when he heard it, it was a music on a particular advert."
00:33:49,00:33:51,"He was terrified, just hated it."
00:33:51,00:33:54,And he was no longer remotely afraid of spiders.
00:33:54,00:33:55,"That's really useful, isn't it?"
00:33:55,00:34:01,"I have a fear of invasive brain surgery, though, so it's a bit worse than my fear of spiders."
00:34:01,00:34:02,That's it.
00:34:02,00:34:09,"There's an organisation, a charity organisation in the UK called Triumph Overphobia, top UK."
00:34:09,00:34:17,"One of the managers is called Trilby Breckman, and Trilby Breckman runs self-help groups."
00:34:17,00:34:18,He sounds like a really cool guy.
00:34:18,00:34:23,"And he said, ""We once had a guy who came to us for six weeks and never said a word."""
00:34:23,00:34:24,He just sat there.
00:34:24,00:34:29,"Then eventually he managed to say, ""I've got a social phobia,"" and then ran out of the"
00:34:29,00:34:30,room.
00:34:30,00:34:31,[laughter]
00:34:31,00:34:32,It's so good.
00:34:32,00:34:33,"But, I mean, we shouldn't be laughing."
00:34:33,00:34:34,We wouldn't be listening.
00:34:34,00:34:35,And this just means it doesn't.
00:34:35,00:34:36,No.
00:34:36,00:34:42,Do you think I'll recommend a group therapy to a guy who's a fear of social environment?
00:34:42,00:34:46,"It's okay to laugh, because he came back the following week, and within a year he was"
00:34:46,00:34:48,running groups by himself as well.
00:34:48,00:34:49,And now he's got a fear of being alone.
00:34:49,00:34:50,[laughter]
00:34:50,00:34:52,He's in the group all the time.
00:34:52,00:34:57,"I was looking up what, because I was like, ""What a spider's scared of,"" because, you know,"
00:34:57,00:34:59,everyone's scared of spiders.
00:34:59,00:35:03,"Most spiders are terrified of ants, because ants contain formic acid, which is really about"
00:35:03,00:35:04,spiders.
00:35:04,00:35:09,"And a lot of them will run for their lives if they see an ant, as it were."
00:35:09,00:35:13,"That's like a quote, like a researcher said, ""It sort of run away."""
00:35:13,00:35:18,"But the University of Canterbury found that they even run away from, some spiders will even"
00:35:18,00:35:23,"run away from another species of spider called a jumping spider, which the gregarious jumping"
00:35:23,00:35:25,"spider, which pretends to be an ant."
00:35:25,00:35:26,That's its defense mechanism.
00:35:26,00:35:27,Right.
00:35:27,00:35:28,And it scares away other spiders.
00:35:28,00:35:29,"So, it hides its legs."
00:35:29,00:35:32,"I think we said that they hide that two of their legs, don't they?"
00:35:32,00:35:35,"So, some species spiders do that, and pretend to be ants, and that scares other species"
00:35:35,00:35:36,who are scared of ants.
00:35:36,00:35:37,Wow.
00:35:37,00:35:41,"Well, someone who's scared of spiders myself a little bit, if I was to dress as a massive"
00:35:41,00:35:42,ant.
00:35:42,00:35:44,"So, do you think that all kind of just leave me alone?"
00:35:44,00:35:45,Possibly.
00:35:45,00:35:50,"So, the spiders in the TV series, I'm a celebrity, get me out of here, must be feeling good"
00:35:50,00:35:54,"this year, because they're going to be missing a big ant on the set this year."
00:35:54,00:35:55,"Oh, sorry."
00:35:55,00:35:56,Good.
00:35:56,00:36:04,"Well, I do think you should never pick up a trancheter, because I hate them because I might"
00:36:04,00:36:08,"ship myself, and if I ship myself, no one's going to hang out with me anyway."
00:36:08,00:36:09,Right.
00:36:09,00:36:10,That makes your social phobia even worse.
00:36:10,00:36:11,Yeah.
00:36:11,00:36:12,"Because you'll scare them too much, and they'll die."
00:36:12,00:36:15,"It's similar, so it's for their sake."
00:36:15,00:36:19,"So, their abdomens are incredibly thin, and one little touch on the abdomen with your fingernail"
00:36:19,00:36:21,"could split it open, and they'll spill their guts all over the place."
00:36:21,00:36:23,"So, you can't just like tickle it on its tummy or anything."
00:36:23,00:36:24,They hate a tummy tingle.
00:36:24,00:36:25,Oh.
00:36:25,00:36:26,"So, don't do that."
00:36:26,00:36:28,"And if you drop a trancheter, it'll almost certainly die."
00:36:28,00:36:29,Really?
00:36:29,00:36:35,"Yeah, this is the advice of the British Trancheter Society, which is a bit of a QI favourite,"
00:36:35,00:36:39,"I think, because it was founded in the 1980s, but the woman who founded it was called"
00:36:39,00:36:41,"Animal and Web, which--"
00:36:41,00:36:42,"Oh, yeah."
00:36:42,00:36:43,Yeah.
00:36:43,00:36:47,"That's going to make watching Home Alone again a more harrowing experience, knowing that that"
00:36:47,00:36:51,"tarantula that gets loose and gets dropped, and I mean, they must have had a stunt spider"
00:36:51,00:36:55,"dressed as a tarantula, if that's the case, because he would have burst open in some"
00:36:55,00:36:56,of the scenes.
00:36:56,00:36:59,I think you're assuming too much knowledge of Home Alone from some of us.
00:36:59,00:37:00,Home Alone?
00:37:00,00:37:01,I can't immediately remember the tarantula scene.
00:37:01,00:37:02,"Oh, you're on stage, though."
00:37:02,00:37:03,Yeah.
00:37:03,00:37:07,"The only thing I remember is Kevin with his hands to his face, screaming, because he's"
00:37:07,00:37:09,been left home alone.
00:37:09,00:37:10,Yeah.
00:37:10,00:37:11,So you've memorized the poster.
00:37:11,00:37:12,That's not-- sorry.
00:37:12,00:37:13,I'm going to have to catch you again.
00:37:13,00:37:15,He's not screaming because he's left home alone.
00:37:15,00:37:16,He's screaming because he put aftershave on his face.
00:37:16,00:37:17,Yeah.
00:37:17,00:37:18,We'll see.
00:37:18,00:37:19,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:37:19,00:37:20,He's pretending because he saw his dad screaming like that.
00:37:20,00:37:21,I don't think so.
00:37:21,00:37:26,"And then you suggestively in the poster, so I mean, he looked like he's screaming at the"
00:37:26,00:37:30,"two robbers who were either side of him, in the famous poster, but in the context of the"
00:37:30,00:37:31,"film, he's never screaming."
00:37:31,00:37:34,"I have an extremely clear, extremely fake memory."
00:37:34,00:37:36,His mom screams.
00:37:36,00:37:38,"His mom sits up on the phone and goes, ""Kevin, that's--."""
00:37:38,00:37:40,"Does he not say-- no, he doesn't say ""Kevin."""
00:37:40,00:37:42,Why did he say his own name?
00:37:42,00:37:43,Does he make any sense?
00:37:43,00:37:45,"I still think you're right, though."
00:37:45,00:37:47,[LAUGHTER]
00:37:47,00:37:49,"What about in home alone, too?"
00:37:49,00:37:50,Does he do it there?
00:37:50,00:37:51,"No, because he's lost in New York."
00:37:51,00:37:52,And that--
00:37:52,00:37:53,Although she says Kevin again in a scream.
00:37:53,00:37:55,"You know, in the Edward Monks, the scream."
00:37:55,00:37:56,Does he do it?
00:37:56,00:37:57,"No, that's actually--"
00:37:57,00:37:59,He's just put aftershave lives.
00:37:59,00:38:00,Yeah.
00:38:00,00:38:05,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:38:05,00:38:07,"OK, that is it."
