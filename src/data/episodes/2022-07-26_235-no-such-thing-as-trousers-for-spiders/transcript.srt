00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,080
 Hello and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast

2
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,360
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.

3
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:29,400
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with Anna Gisinski, James Harkin and Alex

4
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,440
 Bell and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

5
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,180
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.

6
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,840
 Starting with my fact this week, my fact is that a message in a bottle that was thrown

7
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:50,080
 off the Titanic as it was sinking was found one year later washed up on a shore in Ireland

8
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:54,000
 only a few miles from the home of the man who threw it.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,940
 It's pretty extraordinary so this could be that he just dropped it on his way to the Titanic.

10
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:05,800
 So this was a 19 year old, he was called Jeremiah Burke, he was from Glenmeyer County

11
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:12,440
 Cork in Ireland and the way that they were able to verify the bottle because there's been

12
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:17,840
 a lot of forgery bottles that were claimed to be so people trying to make money.

13
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,680
 This bottle was a bottle of holy water that his mother had given to him a sort of good

14
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,320
 luck thing and he used one of his own shoelaces to tie it up as he threw the letter and the

15
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,760
 bottle overboard saying this didn't fucking work, mum, they've sent me a better good luck

16
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,760
 charm next time.

17
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:39,620
 Yeah so the message has a date on it, it's slightly unclear so it could be the 10th, 12th, 13th.

18
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:43,620
 We know that it's sunk on the morning of the 15th but so I don't know why he would have...

19
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,120
 Yeah, that doesn't make sense.

20
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,120
 It's very odd.

21
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,640
 I think at the best of times I don't necessarily know what data is straight away.

22
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,520
 I think as you're going down with a Titanic, maybe you're going...

23
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,520
 What date is it guys?

24
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,520
 What date is it?

25
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,520
 Oh yeah.

26
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,520
 The person next to you is clean of dear life.

27
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,520
 Sorry, do you know what date is it?

28
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,520
 Is it Monday?

29
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,400
 But yeah, so this bottle washed up and I've looked at it on Google Maps.

30
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,760
 It is literally just a couple of miles separate where the area of where they lived right to

31
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:11,320
 this shore and it was found by a coachman who found it and I didn't get to the bottom of

32
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:15,320
 this bit of the story but presumably knew the area, knew the people in the area and thought

33
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:21,500
 "Ah, this guy, you know, he's said "Burk of Glenmare Cork, I know this family, I know the

34
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,500
 burks.

35
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,500
 I'm going to see if this is him."

36
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,960
 And so delivered it to the mother who a year later received this bottle.

37
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,840
 You could argue that it was a hoax at the same time.

38
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,440
 It's only been reported in the last few years properly again since it happened because

39
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,320
 they've been lending it to a museum so they didn't sell it, didn't go through auctions,

40
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,120
 it's been a family heirloom since.

41
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,520
 Yeah, I suppose the natural currents would take it there anyway, wouldn't it?

42
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,520
 I suppose so.

43
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,920
 Yeah, kind of the obvious place for it to end up.

44
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,640
 So where did the Titanic launch from Liverpool, was it?

45
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,400
 It went from Southampton, then I think it went to France and then it went to Ireland and

46
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,480
 its last stop off was in Ireland, I think.

47
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,480
 Was it?

48
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,000
 I didn't know that, all right.

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,800
 But yeah, it was such a weird coincidence but it's so weird how many messages and bottles

50
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:08,160
 or maybe it's not weird how many messages and bottles do get tossed overboard and found

51
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,240
 and there are so many great stories.

52
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:17,800
 So another really good message in bottle coincidence that I liked is that in April 2012, UK fisherman

53
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:23,720
 called Andrew Leeper was fishing near Shetland and he found a message in a bottle and it was

54
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,640
 a note that had been dropped at sea in 1890 and it was one of those that wanted to investigate

55
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,040
 ocean currents so oceanographers were always doing this to investigate where the messages

56
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,120
 ended up to see what the ocean currents were like.

57
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,080
 Anyway, Andrew Leeper found this message in a bottle in 2012 and so it was and it was

58
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:46,480
 really nice because that meant it was the 315th to be put in that log started in 1890.

59
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,320
 So 315 of those messages had been retrieved.

60
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,080
 And it's still going, the log is still, I think.

61
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,080
 It's still keeping log going.

62
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,080
 Oh my god.

63
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,960
 Some incredibly border searchers still sitting there, having this town.

64
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,960
 Yeah, desperately waiting.

65
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,960
 Every 40 years.

66
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,800
 But what I liked about this guy was that he then broke the record for that's the longest

67
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,360
 weight anyone's ever had to read a message in a bottle and the previous record holder had

68
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:12,240
 been his mate Mark Anderson who'd broken it in 2006 in the same boat.

69
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,240
 So what?

70
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,240
 How weird is that?

71
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,480
 So he's friends with him and he did like Leeper didn't interview with the papers when he

72
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,800
 then broke his friend's record and he said, my friend Anderson is very unhappy that I've

73
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:26,040
 topped his record as Anderson never stopped bloody talking about it.

74
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:32,720
 And if anything screams hoax, I'm not suspicious of that one.

75
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,760
 In 1954 I was just looking up other bottles that have been chucked in rather than found.

76
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,360
 Guinness decided to do an advertising promotion.

77
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:48,000
 And they threw 50,000 bottles into the ocean with messages in Guinness bottles, which I find

78
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 unbelievable.

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,680
 So it's known as being Guinness's longest advertising campaign yet because they're still turning

80
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,680
 up.

81
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,480
 But I can't believe that would never be allowed today.

82
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,440
 I'm jumping 50,000 bottles in the ocean.

83
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,880
 It's illegal in a lot of places, yeah, well, it definitely is.

84
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:05,440
 So you'll get fined in Canada for $5,000 if you throw a bottle into the water.

85
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,760
 We found this out because it was a story this year of a guy called Harold Hackett from Prince

86
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,080
 Edward Island.

87
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:17,200
 And he's throwing an estimated 10,000 messages into the ocean since he started.

88
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,720
 And he said he has to retire because he doesn't want to get arrested.

89
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,520
 Well, no, arrest it, but find.

90
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,520
 Yeah, yeah.

91
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,520
 I don't know.

92
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,640
 If that's all his life meant to him, throwing messages in bottles into the ocean.

93
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,960
 I have a limited sympathy with someone like it was my life dream to pollute the ocean.

94
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,440
 I can't believe that the government is moving.

95
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,560
 In the 16th century, it was also illegal to open a bottle if you found it.

96
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,560
 Yeah, I never found evidence of that.

97
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,560
 I think that's it.

98
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,560
 Yeah.

99
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,840
 Is this the whole Queen Victoria having a Queen Elizabeth?

100
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,080
 I'm sorry, Queen Elizabeth having an uncorker of messages.

101
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,920
 I think she did have that because it's mentioned in a Victor Hugo novel.

102
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,440
 I think that was the first mention and that was like two, a hundred years later.

103
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,440
 Oh, okay.

104
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,440
 No, she can't have had an uncorker.

105
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,720
 But it's not, that's not at least a modern invention, is it?

106
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,720
 No.

107
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,440
 I think I think fate needs to exist, even if Victor Hugo is penning it.

108
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,440
 That's true.

109
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,440
 In his novel.

110
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,440
 Yeah.

111
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,440
 In his vicious novel.

112
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,880
 I don't know how many Victor Hugo novels you've read, but there is a lot of extremely

113
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,080
 boring technical, true stuff there.

114
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,080
 I really, yeah.

115
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,040
 Naturally, you'll get like three chapters of the sewage systems of Paris, and so on like.

116
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,040
 Oh, okay.

117
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,040
 Oh, no.

118
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,120
 James's resentment comes out about the fact that he's been reading the same Victor Hugo novel

119
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,120
 for a year.

120
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,120
 Which is genuinely true, right?

121
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,120
 How is it going?

122
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,160
 If anyone here remembers was talking about Victor Hugo, it was probably about six months

123
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,160
 ago.

124
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,040
 Yeah, that was on our 2018 tour at like, and I'm still reading "Lay Viserato".

125
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,040
 Yeah.

126
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:43,200
 With the latest sort of modern instance that I read of this uncorker, comes down to

127
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:48,160
 a 1978 book called "The 12 Million Dollar Note" by Robert Crask in it.

128
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,040
 There's true stories, and then there are also hoax stories.

129
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,020
 And the thought is, is that this was in the book as a hoax story, but it got mixed up in

130
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,120
 all the reviews and so on when people were talking about this.

131
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,920
 It's a true story, and then this is a hoax, and that's why it's spread.

132
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:06,080
 So the idea just to explain that she had an official uncorker of bottles because Queen Elizabeth

133
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,800
 first didn't want anyone else uncorking bottles that contained secret information.

134
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,800
 Yeah.

135
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,760
 It was found, wasn't it, that was thrown from a Navy ship, supposedly, that had military

136
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,840
 details that were very classified.

137
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,240
 As if anyone was throwing bottles over, they would often be people who were in the Navy

138
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,920
 or doing official work for the government, right, checking out currents and stuff like that.

139
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,640
 So they didn't want just anyone to be able to read them.

140
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,160
 And I don't know.

141
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,640
 I know what you mean, and I think your right to be skeptical, and it's probably not true.

142
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,760
 But I don't think it's necessarily true that we're saying that one person had this as his

143
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,400
 only job or anything.

144
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,240
 It could be someone who was part of the Royal Household who also had this job, or…

145
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:52,040
 It's Green of the Stool on the side, he's official uncorker of various royal things.

146
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:57,320
 Yeah, so this idea of doing scientific experiments for the sake of finding out ocean currents

147
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,840
 and stuff by dropping messages in bottles in actually serves a purpose, which seems so

148
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,840
 weird to me.

149
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,320
 So there was this guy George Parker Bitter, who threw a thousand bottles into the North Sea

150
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:12,800
 in 1906, and he promised a shilling reward for anyone who found the bottle and then sent

151
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,840
 it back to him, saying exactly where they'd found it.

152
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:19,640
 And in fact, one woman found the last one in 2015, and she posted it back to the address.

153
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,840
 And the company in Plymouth, that was still monitoring it, had to then track down a shilling

154
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,840
 and all shilling.

155
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,120
 Right, looking on eBay and old anti-coing collectors to centre.

156
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,120
 That's so funny.

157
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:35,440
 Actually, the first ever message in a bottle possibly might have been for that reason,

158
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,200
 which was supposedly Greek philosopher Theo Frastus, who wanted to prove that the Mediterranean

159
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,080
 was fed by the Atlantic.

160
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,840
 And so he put bottles in the Atlantic and saw them go round the corner into the med, and

161
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,840
 he could prove that.

162
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,400
 Again, this is a slightly not sure if this is true or not.

163
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,680
 And did he leave a message saying, whoever finds us, can you tell me the location?

164
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,680
 Pretty much, right?

165
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,680
 That's the idea.

166
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,680
 That's cool.

167
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,520
 And he saw them go round the corner, did you see?

168
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,480
 No, I think again, this is possibly not true, but he would have put them in the water,

169
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,320
 and then there would have been, like, dance as a message, saying, "Contact, Theo Frastus

170
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,320
 on..."

171
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,320
 You know?

172
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,320
 075.

173
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,720
 075 out of the square happens.

174
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,920
 There was a thing on, like, the US government, noticals like, which said that a lot of the

175
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,560
 nautical maps we have now are based on those messages.

176
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:27,000
 So in the 1950s, I think loads of messages in bottles were put in the Gulf of Maine.

177
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,320
 And all the maps we have of, like, all the different ocean currents there, basically

178
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,360
 based on where everyone picked all those messages up, and where, and, you know, then they sent

179
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,360
 back saying, "Hey, I'm here.

180
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,360
 I've just found this."

181
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,080
 And that's where a lot of ocean maps come from.

182
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,200
 And now we've got, like, satellite technology and stuff.

183
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,200
 Also, I think quite recently I'm sure we must have mentioned this, but there was all those

184
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:49,280
 rubber ducks that fell off a tanker, and they floated around everywhere, and we got loads

185
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,280
 of data from that.

186
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,280
 Yeah, really?

187
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,280
 So that's still happening.

188
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,280
 Yeah.

189
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,280
 I think they still wash up every now and then.

190
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,280
 Yeah, they do.

191
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,280
 Yeah.

192
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,280
 I read an article.

193
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:02,680
 I read mental floss article all about messages and bottles, and then the article veers away

194
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,720
 because this isn't technically a message and a bottle, but it's a pretty extraordinary story.

195
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,920
 So I'm just going to read it anyway.

196
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,440
 This happened in 2001.

197
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,600
 There was a girl called Laura Bucston, and she was coming up to 10 years old.

198
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,160
 She released a red balloon into the air.

199
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,760
 She lived in Stoke on Trent in England.

200
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,600
 And on the balloon, she wrote, "Please return to Laura Bucston."

201
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,760
 And on the other side of the balloon, she put her home address.

202
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,000
 So they released it into the air.

203
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 It disappeared.

204
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,680
 A few weeks later, 140 miles away, the balloon hit a hedge when it came down.

205
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:40,880
 And the person who picked it up saw the name and saw the address and immediately went what

206
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,560
 the hell was going on and went to his neighbor because his neighbor had a daughter who was

207
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,720
 10 years old who also had the name Laura Bucston.

208
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,320
 So it landed exactly with the same age, same name, the person.

209
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,600
 They got in contact, and they were saying, "What amazing coincidence.

210
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,600
 Let's meet up."

211
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,200
 So on the day of the meeting, the two girls, independently without having decided what

212
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,480
 they were going to do, both came in the same outfit.

213
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,760
 They both had a pink sweater and were wearing jeans.

214
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,760
 jeans.

215
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,760
 Oh my goodness.

216
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,760
 Oh my goodness.

217
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,520
 This is just collecting all the qubits that happened at the moment.

218
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:14,680
 They were both roughly the same height, which was like two girls the same age and roughly

219
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,680
 the same height.

220
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,440
 So they were tall ten-year-olds.

221
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,440
 So they were very surprised.

222
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,440
 Oh, you're a tall ten-year-old.

223
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,440
 Tiny little qubits.

224
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,440
 Yes.

225
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,440
 No.

226
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,440
 I like pizza.

227
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,440
 They both had brown hair.

228
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,440
 They wore it in the same style.

229
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,680
 They both had three-year-old black Labrador retrievers.

230
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,240
 They both had a gray pet rabbit, not on them, they left them out.

231
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:39,040
 They both brought, they did bring their own guinea pigs, which were the same color, and

232
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,160
 had the same orange markings on their high quarters.

233
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,880
 This is mental floss, so I know it sounds like I'm reading an April fool's thing, but this

234
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,880
 is...

235
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,680
 But also, like, if that was in a local news story, I'm a journalist in a local news story

236
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,680
 and still come trend.

237
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,680
 I would go and go, "Come on, give me some more.

238
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,680
 What have you got?

239
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,680
 You have a dog?"

240
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,680
 Yeah.

241
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,680
 Okay.

242
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,680
 What is on local, as well?

243
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,680
 Yeah, exactly.

244
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,680
 What color-haired does she have?

245
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,680
 Brilliant.

246
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,680
 Nice one.

247
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,680
 Yeah.

248
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,680
 Can I just say this?

249
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,680
 I don't know why these two are being like this.

250
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,680
 They must have woken up on the wrong side of their bed.

251
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,680
 Because that does happen sometimes.

252
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,680
 Sure.

253
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,680
 I mean, mental things.

254
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,280
 I suppose you could say the law of large numbers means that there's enough things that happen

255
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:15,680
 in the world, which aren't coincidental, that some coincidental things do happen sometimes.

256
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,680
 Yeah.

257
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,680
 Thousands of lower boxers pick up fan balloons every day.

258
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,680
 It does happen not to be wearing the same clothes.

259
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,000
 But I thought we should still get excited by coincidences.

260
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,520
 I know it's like, "Oh, this could happen anyway."

261
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,520
 It's still amazing.

262
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,520
 Yeah.

263
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,000
 I think maybe we did get out of bed on the wrong side, but on the other hand, did you not

264
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,760
 when you're a kid release loads of balloons with notes on them and never get a single fucking

265
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,760
 reply from anyone?

266
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,760
 Yeah.

267
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,760
 Is that what you're attempting now?

268
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,760
 I'm never going to school.

269
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,760
 Yeah.

270
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,040
 It was a very common thing for people to do when I was a kid.

271
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,840
 We don't do any more because it's like bad for the environment, but they used to be really

272
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,840
 involved to do that.

273
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,840
 Didn't they?

274
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,840
 Everyone, do you write a note on your thing?

275
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,760
 We would use to go to Tiggies for our birthday every year, which is an Italian restaurant

276
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,480
 in Bolton, and then we'd get a free balloon, and then we'd write a note on it.

277
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,480
 Yeah.

278
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,480
 Yeah, same.

279
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,480
 Every birthday party.

280
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,320
 Some bastard in Bolton was shooting them down over there.

281
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,720
 Did you really go to Scotland for shared with thousands of labels of dead balloons that James

282
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,720
 Arkansas couldn't name one?

283
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:12,240
 There was one person, the one girl who did it and landed in the bag on the Buckingham Palace

284
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,240
 and the Queen Centre Park.

285
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,240
 Did you remember that?

286
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,240
 Did you?

287
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,240
 She was called Elizabeth Windsor.

288
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,240
 And she was 90-year-old girl from bookstore.

289
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,480
 And they both turned out wearing crowns.

290
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:33,880
 You've got a beefy to do.

291
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:39,040
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Alex.

292
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,960
 My fact this week is that the original mastermind to chair was specially modified to have detachable

293
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:49,720
 arms, quote, "in case a contender is too large to fit between them."

294
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,280
 Oh, OK, so we're going to explain what mastermind is for non-British people.

295
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:58,120
 Yes, so it's a long-running quiz show.

296
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,040
 It's been running since 1972.

297
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,160
 It's a very like paired back quiz show.

298
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,680
 So it's a dark studio, you have a person asking questions, and you have four contestants,

299
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:11,160
 and they each come up to a chair one at a time, and the chair is the kind of the famous symbol

300
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,840
 of the show.

301
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,680
 And each contestant is asked a specialist subject, so yeah, prepare a specialist subject.

302
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:21,480
 So if you know, for example, Titanic facts and everything about it, you would get quizzed

303
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,320
 in a very quick space of time, everything about the Titanic and the more point to get you

304
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,320
 in.

305
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,320
 It's like an expert quiz.

306
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,320
 Yeah, exactly.

307
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,440
 And it was based on a guy who was in the war, in Second World War, he was Nare F. Gunner,

308
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:39,720
 and he was captured in Germany and questioned by the Germans, and it's kind of supposed to

309
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,720
 be almost the same way that he felt at the time, which is you've got a big light on

310
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,360
 you, they're asking you questions again and again and again, to kind of put you under as much

311
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,360
 pressure as possible.

312
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,360
 Yeah.

313
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,440
 Yeah, his name was Bill Wright, and yeah, exactly that.

314
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,040
 He was a prisoner of war, and he thought, oh, this will make a great game show.

315
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:02,800
 He was being interrogated by the Nazis, and interestingly, he says in Germany, so you

316
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,480
 were asked three questions, which is name, rank, and number.

317
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,200
 And that's still the thing that in Mastermind, it's name, occupation, and specialist subject.

318
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,080
 He took the rule of three that they, and he directly associates it with that.

319
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,800
 And when they started it, Magnus Magnuson, who is the original host of the show, and his

320
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,520
 name is, he's Icelandic, so that's a nice, Icelandic name, Magnus Magnuson.

321
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,040
 Do you know what his dad's name was?

322
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,040
 No, I don't.

323
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,040
 What his dad's first name was.

324
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,040
 Yeah.

325
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,040
 It was not Magnus.

326
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,040
 No, so I changed it.

327
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:35,200
 Yeah, in Iceland, it's supposed to be your surname is son of your father, so my dad's

328
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,480
 called Michael, so I should be James Michelson.

329
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,480
 Right.

330
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,160
 His father was called Anna.

331
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,320
 Seagrstein, wasn't he?

332
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,320
 Seagrstein.

333
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:48,280
 So he should have been Seagrsteinson, but actually his father was called Seagrstein Magnuson,

334
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,000
 and in Scotland, of course, you have the same surname as your father, so he had to keep the

335
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 same surname.

336
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 Oh, okay.

337
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 Wow.

338
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 That's very interesting.

339
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,720
 So, yeah, so Magnus, usually you'd be a quiz host or, you know, you'd have a title like

340
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,720
 that.

341
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,720
 His title, when he was doing the show, was the interrogator, so that's what he was

342
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,720
 introduced at.

343
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,720
 He was completely tied into his experience.

344
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,080
 And he was actually a Nazi as well, wasn't he, Magnus Magnuson?

345
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,080
 He was, yeah.

346
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,080
 Was he?

347
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,080
 No.

348
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,080
 Geez.

349
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,080
 No, he was a national treasure.

350
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,080
 I thought I missed that paragraph, and I was reading it to this.

351
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,520
 You don't know what's weird, though, is that another little link in that I know from

352
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,560
 our friend who was on Mastermind.

353
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,400
 So Ian Dunn, who's a big fan of QI, and who we know, he went on Mastermind, and he said,

354
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,080
 "When you fill in the forms, when you're saying what your specialist subject should

355
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,640
 be, it's called the Mastermind SS form.

356
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,640
 They have a stop."

357
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,640
 That's very funny.

358
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:43,600
 I read on Wikipedia, they have a list of a few subjects that have actually been rejected.

359
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,960
 A few of the ones that have been rejected include Roots to Anywhere in Mainland Britain by

360
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,920
 Road from Letchworth.

361
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,440
 The banana industry, not allowed to pick the banana industry, as you're...

362
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,440
 Not allowed to pick it.

363
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,440
 Nice.

364
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,960
 A orthopedic bone cement in total hip replacement is another.

365
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:07,080
 The last word of the wiki is Perfect Squares up to 99 Squared.

366
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,280
 What is a Perfect Squared on?

367
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:17,860
 It's 9,801, but that's one point.

368
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:22,440
 In recent years, I read in an article that subjects like faulty towers, black adder, rolled

369
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:28,600
 dull, harry potter, so they've been ruled out because so many people have picked it that

370
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,480
 they've run out of questions, basically.

371
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,680
 They don't know what else to ask about black adder that's not been done before.

372
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:39,240
 The thing with harry potter is that last year, 262 people wanted to do it as a specialist

373
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:44,320
 subject on Mastermind, that's according to producer Mark Helzby.

374
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,880
 The first three winners were women, which was quite bizarre because far fewer women than

375
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:54,480
 men have ended up winning the titles, not because women are less clever because of centuries

376
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,920
 and centuries of systemic oppression blah blah blah.

377
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:07,520
 I would say that your specialist subjects is not fabulous, look, I believe it, it's just

378
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,240
 a long explanation to go into.

379
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,800
 But yeah, the first three people who won were women and then in 35 years, it's been eight

380
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,600
 women and 21 men who won it, but after the first three years, everyone was speculating

381
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,440
 is a man ever going to win Mastermind.

382
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,040
 Can we talk about the chair very quickly?

383
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,040
 Yes.

384
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:30,600
 The chair was voted in a survey for House Beautiful magazine as the second greatest chair, basically,

385
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,600
 of pop culture.

386
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,920
 Or can we guess the first?

387
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,800
 Yeah, have a go, yeah.

388
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:40,120
 Just one extra bit of context, this is, it was voted as the second most iconic chair of

389
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,120
 the 20th century.

390
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,280
 I was going to say the wool second, the house of lords or whatever it is.

391
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,120
 Is it a sofa from friends?

392
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,120
 No, it's not.

393
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,120
 Okay, so it's...

394
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,120
 Is it in pop culture, right?

395
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,120
 Is it chair?

396
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,120
 The singer.

397
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,120
 No, it's in.

398
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:55,640
 Okay, so I'm going to say it's the 1960s.

399
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:00,120
 It is a chair that made the newspapers because it was a scandalous...

400
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,120
 Nixon.

401
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,240
 It was a scandalous chair, basically.

402
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,240
 Scandalist chair.

403
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,240
 Elvis.

404
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,240
 Elvis.

405
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,240
 Did he have a chair?

406
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,240
 Didn't need it.

407
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,240
 So if you just had Elvis in it.

408
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,240
 He died on the toilet, yeah.

409
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,240
 They often call it the throne.

410
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,240
 Yeah.

411
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,240
 That's true.

412
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,240
 Well, no.

413
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,440
 Is it the chair that Liza Monelli sat on in that film?

414
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,440
 Is that 1960s?

415
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,040
 No, it's not, but it's interesting, have a think in your head about what she does with

416
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,040
 that chair and you might get to it somehow.

417
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,040
 Is it Chicago?

418
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,040
 You're thinking...

419
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,040
 She sits backwards.

420
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,040
 Does someone sit backwards on it in an iconic photo?

421
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,040
 We are so close.

422
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,040
 Is it Marilyn Monroe?

423
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,040
 No, that's it.

424
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,040
 No, it's Christine Keeler.

425
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,040
 Yeah, we go Profumo.

426
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,040
 Profumo.

427
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,040
 Yes, one of those.

428
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,040
 Nice.

429
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:42,280
 Yeah, so that got voted the Christine Keeler sitting backwards on a chair as the most iconic.

430
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,080
 Very much that was more about Keeler than the chair.

431
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:50,880
 Except in its time, most comedians would parody that shot and still do of being

432
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,880
 naked on a chair that way round in reference to that.

433
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,880
 I think for that reason that chair is the concept of the chair.

434
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,880
 Yeah, exactly.

435
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:01,880
 I can picture the picture you're talking about, which I think means it counts.

436
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,880
 We'll allow it.

437
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,880
 So the last chair on Mastermind was given to Magnus Magnus and when he retired.

438
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,520
 They've got a new one now, which like Alex says, has these detachable arms.

439
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,920
 It is an Eames soft pad.

440
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:19,560
 It was designed in 1969 and it was designed by Charles and Ray Eames, who are basically

441
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,600
 the best chair designers in the history of the world.

442
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,200
 He's like Trumpish of you.

443
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,200
 Yeah.

444
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,200
 I have his chairs.

445
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,200
 They make great chairs.

446
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,200
 They are the famous.

447
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,840
 They're the big names in chairs.

448
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,280
 They were a husband and wife couple and they made loads of mass-produced chairs.

449
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:38,880
 And the first thing they ever mass-produced was a molded plywood leg splint for World

450
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,520
 War II, which they gave to all the soldiers and it was molded on Charles' own leg.

451
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,280
 And they sold 150,000 of them.

452
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,760
 So there were soldiers all around the world walking on an exact replica of his own leg.

453
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,760
 Wow.

454
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,760
 That's amazing.

455
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,760
 That's incredible.

456
00:20:54,760 --> 00:21:01,600
 My favorite TV chair is the chair that was in the audition room when Robin Williams went

457
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,800
 audition for the role of Mork from Ork on Happy Days.

458
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,560
 So I think that spun off into Mork and Mindy, didn't it?

459
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:13,000
 But the producer was a guy called Gary Marshall and Robin Williams came into the room and

460
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,440
 he was unknown at the time, walked in and Gary Marshall was told him to take a seat

461
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:20,560
 and immediately Robin Williams went to the chair and stood on his head on it and Marshall

462
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,720
 immediately hired him, saying he was the only alien who applied for the job, so.

463
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,720
 Wow.

464
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,720
 It's cool.

465
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,640
 Those stories are quite dangerous because it encourages literally everyone to go into

466
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,120
 audition and really break the mold.

467
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,760
 And can you imagine saying that for hours after every single person comes in and does something

468
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,080
 really annoying with the chair?

469
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,160
 You're the only one who sat on the chair.

470
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,160
 That was the test.

471
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,160
 Do you want to tell you?

472
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,160
 We're not looking for actual aliens.

473
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,160
 We need an actor.

474
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:46,560
 We need somebody who's going to be easy to work with, to do the same form as time after time

475
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:56,600
 and love will take.

476
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,600
 Okay.

477
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,480
 It is time for fact number three and that is Chazinski.

478
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,600
 My fact this week is that one competition at the Highland Games used to be pulling the

479
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,160
 legs off a cow in order to win a sheep.

480
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:11,120
 Therfs really hard in Scotland out late because when I was at school, I used to pull legs

481
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,640
 off a daddy long legs, but in Scotland they pull legs off a cow.

482
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:20,080
 It sounds like a metaphor for like ruining something because a cow is more valuable than a sheep,

483
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,240
 so why don't you just keep the cow and leave the legs on?

484
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,080
 So the cow is dead at this point, I should say.

485
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,160
 So it's not as awful, still quite awful.

486
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,560
 Yeah, it's pretty pretty, really bad.

487
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,560
 It's not ideal.

488
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,800
 It's a strength test and it would be impressive if someone could twist the legs off a cow

489
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,800
 with his own bare hands.

490
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,920
 So emotional strength test as well to witness what you've just done to this poor cow?

491
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:42,200
 If you ever see Anna in the country side and you want to impress her.

492
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:53,920
 This was actually invented in 1820 and I don't think it was that long-lasting, but the idea

493
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,880
 of the contest was invented by a guy called Alistair McDonnell who was a clan chief and apparently

494
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:03,760
 he was just this really cool eccentric, vibrant clan chiefed in character.

495
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,560
 In fact, he was the character of Fergus McIver in the Waverly, Walter Scott's Waverly novel

496
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:12,920
 was based on and yeah, he said let's do this, that'll be fun and the first prize is a fat

497
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,920
 sheep.

498
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,920
 Okay.

499
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,520
 And the reason it didn't last probably is because it was extremely difficult.

500
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,520
 Yes.

501
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,000
 I read one, I don't think it might have happened maybe once or twice in one or two different

502
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,040
 ones, but the one that I read was in Invergari and there was only one man who succeeded after

503
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:35,040
 struggling for about an hour as a reward he received his sheep and the eulogistic speech

504
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,040
 from the chief.

505
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,040
 Nice.

506
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,760
 Has anyone been to the Highland games?

507
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,760
 No.

508
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,760
 I have been.

509
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,760
 Yeah, it's really awesome.

510
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,760
 It's really good.

511
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,760
 It's almost like a fate.

512
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:49,200
 The one that I went to is like a village fate, but then you've also got these incredible

513
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,480
 things happening where people throw in these massive weights really, really high.

514
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,480
 Like really high.

515
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:01,160
 The big logs, the big, I saw the paper tossing, the main one I saw, they were like, they had

516
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:05,160
 these kind of, you know, like kettlebells that you would use in the gym and we're throwing

517
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,680
 this over a big, big, big, high height.

518
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,680
 Wow.

519
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,680
 I was really impressed.

520
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,080
 Is it kind of like high jump?

521
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,080
 Is there a bar?

522
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,080
 Yeah.

523
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,160
 So we get higher and higher and higher at the time.

524
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,640
 And the paper toss is not about how far you can toss it.

525
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,240
 It's about, you have to toss it so that it lands at 12 o'clock so it lands upright.

526
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:27,880
 So it's got to stay up in the air for like an hour and a half who's jumping in the morning.

527
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,520
 Depending on time you throw it.

528
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,000
 Don't throw it at 9 a.m.

529
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,440
 It's not, yeah, as in it lands, like, facing away from you, is it worth it?

530
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,440
 Yes.

531
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,880
 So you need to do a full rotation of 180 and then land exactly facing away from you, don't

532
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,880
 land.

533
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,880
 Exactly, perpendicular to the earth.

534
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,880
 Yes.

535
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,920
 Ah, so it would be extremely hard to pull the leg off a cow, right?

536
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,400
 I think they'd twisted.

537
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,000
 People tend to say twist quite a lot.

538
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 And is that, is that how you pull it?

539
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,360
 I think that is how you would do it, yeah.

540
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,360
 I think so.

541
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,840
 Let's say you want to pull a chicken leg off a chicken.

542
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,840
 Yeah.

543
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,600
 You tend to give it a twist while you're pulling, don't you?

544
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,080
 I can see what you're saying, actually.

545
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,080
 I can picture that now.

546
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,320
 Do you know the ideal shape for a cow right in the 19th century?

547
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,320
 We've got four legs for us, don't we?

548
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,800
 Well, unless it's kind of square because I can't really picture cows because I can't

549
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,800
 picture anything.

550
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,920
 But if I ever had to draw one, I'd draw it particularly square for an animal, right?

551
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:22,680
 And that's, if you picture drawings in the 19th century, then cows would be vast and very

552
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,680
 square.

553
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,520
 And there was a lot of competition between members of the ability and landowners about getting

554
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,160
 the right shape of your animals.

555
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,920
 So yeah, if you look at cows, they don't look like real cows.

556
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:37,120
 And the actual, the size of a cow between 1710 and 1795 increased by a third.

557
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,480
 So people were really building up their cows.

558
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,000
 Sorry, what were the dates?

559
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 Between 1710 and 1795.

560
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,800
 So that was when they started getting bigger.

561
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,400
 So it's only a couple of generations.

562
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,400
 Yeah, absolutely.

563
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:49,280
 But cows were supposed to be rectangular.

564
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,280
 Exactly rectangular.

565
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:54,600
 Sheep were supposed to tend towards being oblong and pigs, the ideal shape for a pig was

566
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,600
 a football shape.

567
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,720
 Well, what kind of football?

568
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,760
 As in, in those days was F.A. regulation standards, black and white and eggs again.

569
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,760
 I think round.

570
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,480
 So if you get pictures of pigs very often, they'll be the picture with their stomachs

571
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,480
 literally on the floor.

572
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,480
 Like a potbelly pig.

573
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,280
 Because they've actually been to turn them into footballs, didn't they?

574
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,280
 Yeah, exactly.

575
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,280
 Pigs, butters.

576
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,280
 Yeah.

577
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,280
 So why were the cows square?

578
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,520
 Because usually when you make things square, it's that you can stack them.

579
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,320
 But I don't think they did that in a cow.

580
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,160
 A bit more in a little.

581
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,160
 Yeah.

582
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,160
 Well, this was just getting them bigger.

583
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,480
 And that was the shapes they tended towards.

584
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:31,200
 I read, just going back to the history of the Scotland Highland Games.

585
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,800
 I read that the very first one, so they don't know exactly where the first one occurred.

586
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:42,520
 But it is believed that one of the first early venues was at Fettoreso.

587
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:47,040
 And technically, it's a few miles south of the Scottish Highlands.

588
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,040
 So the first one made no sense.

589
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,040
 So the lowlands.

590
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,040
 It's in the lowlands.

591
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,000
 So it's actually the lowland games.

592
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,080
 That's a really good find to history.

593
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,080
 If it's true.

594
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,080
 Yeah.

595
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,600
 Unfortunately, as the article says, if it did happen there, it predates recorded history.

596
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,600
 We'll never know.

597
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:07,560
 Because really the first one, which is kind of a modern style, was in Brema in the early

598
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:12,840
 1800s. And it came at a time when the Scottish were kind of finding themselves.

599
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,920
 And that's when all that kind of tartan, it did exist.

600
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,880
 But it was when it was properly became like this in the last five days.

601
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,360
 But it's quite an informal type thing.

602
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,680
 There aren't the Highland Games.

603
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,360
 Or there weren't the Highland Games right at the same time.

604
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,760
 It's, yeah, it's more just like a festival type thing, isn't it?

605
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,760
 Yeah.

606
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,760
 Yeah.

607
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,760
 Various times over the summer.

608
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,760
 Every place will have one.

609
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,760
 And it's weird.

610
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,760
 It's not just these like any time I've thought of it.

611
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,760
 I've thought of throwing these giant logs.

612
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,240
 And as you say, the kettlebell style weights.

613
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:41,720
 But they do stuff like biggest bowl of porridge, you know, as a competition.

614
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:48,880
 And there was one that was made in 2010, that's the record, which is, it was 690 litres of

615
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,880
 porridge.

616
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,880
 So it was 2000 people.

617
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,480
 It was just by Goldilocks, who said, "This porridge is too small."

618
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,480
 So yeah.

619
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,800
 But it's all tourist as well, isn't it?

620
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,800
 Yeah.

621
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,800
 No Scottish people have ever been to the Highland Games.

622
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,360
 And you know who, well, you know who used to go to it, Billy Conley all the time.

623
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,040
 And as a result, he used to bring his best mates along, who happened to be famous comedians

624
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,040
 as well.

625
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:15,040
 One of which, who went, was Robin Williams, just to bring all the alien chairman back into

626
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,040
 the conversation.

627
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,040
 Yeah.

628
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:28,720
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is James.

629
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:34,000
 My fact this week is that you can cure your arachnophobia by drawing pictures of smiling

630
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 spiders.

631
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 So good.

632
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 I'm actually going to try this.

633
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 Can you read the full book?

634
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 Yeah.

635
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 Yeah, me too.

636
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 Do you need to draw like a, like a, like a nude, like a life model kind of, do you need

637
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 the spider there?

638
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,160
 Well, they are always usually nude spiders, because they can't, they can't get trousers without

639
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,160
 legs.

640
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,480
 So he drew like a sexy photo of a spider, with that make it less scary?

641
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,800
 Like a profumo sitting on a chair.

642
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,080
 He had four legs every time.

643
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,840
 So this is a clinical hypnotherapist called Adam Cox.

644
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:08,320
 He is British, or he pretends he's in Britain, and he encourages his clients to draw brightly

645
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:13,040
 coloured, smiling spiders with big eyes, and he says that it reduces their feelings of

646
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,080
 anxiety towards the arachnids.

647
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:21,200
 But so does it cure you in a, you're, presumably it's not like, okay, I'm going to be encountering

648
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,280
 a spider in the next five minutes.

649
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,680
 I'm going to quickly draw a picture of a smiling one too.

650
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:29,640
 No, it's a long-term therapy, so people are going week after week and drawing more and

651
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,640
 more spiders.

652
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,720
 And eventually it makes them feel less anxious.

653
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,000
 It maybe sounds like the early stages of a very severe phobia treatment, so as in you can't

654
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,760
 even, because you know there are some phobias where you can't even say the word of the thing

655
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,040
 you're scared of, and the idea of drawing a spider is probably really scary and horrible

656
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,280
 and thinking about the details of it is probably part of it.

657
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:49,680
 Well, I am an arachnid phobia, a little bit not as much as I used to be as a kid, but I would

658
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:54,720
 always find it really hard to see a picture of them in a book, and even now on the internet

659
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,720
 I find it quite hard.

660
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,720
 I have to scroll past them.

661
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,720
 Me too.

662
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,720
 Really?

663
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,600
 Yeah, just get it out of shot and just read the text.

664
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,320
 How do you have to research this background?

665
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,960
 So what's interesting as well as there was a study that was done in Queensland in Australia

666
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,480
 and along with a UK university in Sussex.

667
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,200
 And they were saying that if you have a fear of spiders, if you have arachnophobia, you

668
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:23,360
 are more likely to see a spider as in your hardwired, as they say, to notice the threats.

669
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,320
 So if you were out in Queensland and you were walking through the bush, if I'm walking

670
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:31,480
 with you and I'm less scared, I might not see a spider that's obviously there, but you

671
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,680
 are on edge waiting to see one.

672
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,040
 Yeah, actually, that's almost logical.

673
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:40,800
 I do have a problem with movement in general, so if I see any movement out the corner of

674
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,680
 my eye, it really freaks me out.

675
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:47,080
 And the reason they, their movement is particularly weird, because I think we mentioned recently,

676
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:51,080
 actually, how they move by hydraulic pressure, but I don't realise it was all spiders moving

677
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,080
 that way.

678
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,800
 So when they stretch their legs out, they're not doing it with their muscles at all.

679
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,960
 They're pumping blood out through their legs, which is why they move in that weird jerky

680
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,960
 way.

681
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:04,520
 And that's why when they die, they always shrivel up, because the pressure disappears, so they

682
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,520
 shrivel up.

683
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:09,120
 So basically, when they run, they have to have an erection in every one of their legs.

684
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,120
 That's exactly it, yeah.

685
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,120
 Wow.

686
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,320
 It's very quickly getting harder than not getting harder.

687
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,320
 Exactly.

688
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,320
 Yeah.

689
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:20,320
 Their genitals are hydraulic as well, by the way, so they operate with some hydraulic pressure.

690
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,840
 And also, they obviously have this really cool thing spider penises where they can keep

691
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,760
 on having sex without the spider.

692
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:30,640
 So there are quite a few spiders, like the all-web spider, which will start having sex with

693
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,960
 a lady spider, and then detaches its penis to get away, because I was a football.

694
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,960
 Have to take a call.

695
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,160
 I'm so sorry, I'll be back in a minute.

696
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,160
 You have this.

697
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,160
 Exactly.

698
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:43,320
 And it's actually more effective without its spider attachment.

699
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:48,080
 As soon as the spider leaves, the penises tend to eject about 70% of their sperm after

700
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,080
 that.

701
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,080
 So they keep pumping sperm out.

702
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,080
 Wow.

703
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,080
 Even when the spider's gone.

704
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,080
 Wow.

705
00:31:53,080 --> 00:32:00,320
 I was looking into general phobias, because obviously there are so many phobias out there, and I found

706
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,560
 this long list just to see which ones are actual phobias, because there must be a phobia for

707
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:08,800
 everything, but there's a limitation, obviously, on ones that have been given names.

708
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,800
 Yeah.

709
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:13,520
 So the ones that I found that I thought were quite interesting that have actual names

710
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,840
 assigned to them.

711
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,520
 There's a phobia for the fear of opinions.

712
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,160
 That's very interesting.

713
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,160
 I'm just fearful.

714
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:23,000
 I'm just really sure what I think about that.

715
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,520
 There is the fear of flutes.

716
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:30,120
 When you say there is, as in a guy on the internet, decide to attribute names to one of the

717
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,120
 fears.

718
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,600
 No, so this is a big list that a guy wrote.

719
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,600
 Phobia.

720
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,440
 Not Wikipedia is called something like phobia, weirdphobias.com was something like that.

721
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,200
 I think that's a really difficult thing, isn't it, because there's a list of millions

722
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,200
 of them.

723
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,720
 There's like someone wrote one about a fear of a doc secretly looking at you or something

724
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,880
 like that, which is obviously not true.

725
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,800
 Then on the other hand, there are such weird ones that are true.

726
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,160
 It's really hard to tell which ones are enough.

727
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,240
 So, like, phobia is definitely a thing.

728
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,240
 Is it?

729
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,240
 Being scared of ferns.

730
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,200
 I think quite a few famous people have got that.

731
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,040
 Furn cotton, which is very difficult for her.

732
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,040
 Yeah.

733
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,040
 I think she's scared of cotton as well.

734
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,040
 Yeah.

735
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,480
 And fear of like holes and stuff like that is really common.

736
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,480
 Yes.

737
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,480
 I've heard of that one.

738
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,480
 I've heard of that one.

739
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,480
 I've heard of that one.

740
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,480
 I've heard of fear of chins.

741
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,480
 Do you reckon that's a real one?

742
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,480
 It's hard to imagine.

743
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,480
 But that's what I mean.

744
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,480
 It's hard to say whether it isn't.

745
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,480
 Yeah.

746
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,920
 You know, a guy had his arachnophobia accidentally removed quite recently.

747
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:27,080
 So, you can get rid of accidentally, but it does involve really invasive surgery.

748
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,840
 This was a guy who'd always been terrified of spiders.

749
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,400
 And then also he got an illness where he started having seizures.

750
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,080
 And so he went in for an operation to get rid of his seizures, and they had to remove

751
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,880
 a bit of his amygdala.

752
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:42,760
 And the surgery went really well, but he woke up and he found just two slight changes to

753
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,760
 his character.

754
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,480
 He had this stomach-lurching aversion to a very specific kind of music.

755
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,720
 So when he heard it, it was a music on a particular advert.

756
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,920
 He was terrified, just hated it.

757
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,040
 And he was no longer remotely afraid of spiders.

758
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,720
 That's really useful, isn't it?

759
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:01,800
 I have a fear of invasive brain surgery, though, so it's a bit worse than my fear of spiders.

760
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,800
 That's it.

761
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:09,600
 There's an organisation, a charity organisation in the UK called Triumph Overphobia, top UK.

762
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:17,160
 One of the managers is called Trilby Breckman, and Trilby Breckman runs self-help groups.

763
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,760
 He sounds like a really cool guy.

764
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:23,480
 And he said, "We once had a guy who came to us for six weeks and never said a word."

765
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,800
 He just sat there.

766
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,680
 Then eventually he managed to say, "I've got a social phobia," and then ran out of the

767
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,680
 room.

768
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:31,680
 [laughter]

769
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,680
 It's so good.

770
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,680
 But, I mean, we shouldn't be laughing.

771
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,680
 We wouldn't be listening.

772
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:35,680
 And this just means it doesn't.

773
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,680
 No.

774
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:42,160
 Do you think I'll recommend a group therapy to a guy who's a fear of social environment?

775
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:46,120
 It's okay to laugh, because he came back the following week, and within a year he was

776
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,440
 running groups by himself as well.

777
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,920
 And now he's got a fear of being alone.

778
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,920
 [laughter]

779
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,800
 He's in the group all the time.

780
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,640
 I was looking up what, because I was like, "What a spider's scared of," because, you know,

781
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,320
 everyone's scared of spiders.

782
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:03,740
 Most spiders are terrified of ants, because ants contain formic acid, which is really about

783
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:04,740
 spiders.

784
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:09,280
 And a lot of them will run for their lives if they see an ant, as it were.

785
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,120
 That's like a quote, like a researcher said, "It sort of run away."

786
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:18,640
 But the University of Canterbury found that they even run away from, some spiders will even

787
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:23,600
 run away from another species of spider called a jumping spider, which the gregarious jumping

788
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,560
 spider, which pretends to be an ant.

789
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,640
 That's its defense mechanism.

790
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,640
 Right.

791
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,640
 And it scares away other spiders.

792
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,640
 So, it hides its legs.

793
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,040
 I think we said that they hide that two of their legs, don't they?

794
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:35,660
 So, some species spiders do that, and pretend to be ants, and that scares other species

795
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,660
 who are scared of ants.

796
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,660
 Wow.

797
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:41,200
 Well, someone who's scared of spiders myself a little bit, if I was to dress as a massive

798
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,200
 ant.

799
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,520
 So, do you think that all kind of just leave me alone?

800
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,520
 Possibly.

801
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:50,480
 So, the spiders in the TV series, I'm a celebrity, get me out of here, must be feeling good

802
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,240
 this year, because they're going to be missing a big ant on the set this year.

803
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,240
 Oh, sorry.

804
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,240
 Good.

805
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:04,700
 Well, I do think you should never pick up a trancheter, because I hate them because I might

806
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:08,520
 ship myself, and if I ship myself, no one's going to hang out with me anyway.

807
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,520
 Right.

808
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,520
 That makes your social phobia even worse.

809
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,520
 Yeah.

810
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,520
 Because you'll scare them too much, and they'll die.

811
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:15,040
 It's similar, so it's for their sake.

812
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:19,120
 So, their abdomens are incredibly thin, and one little touch on the abdomen with your fingernail

813
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,440
 could split it open, and they'll spill their guts all over the place.

814
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,840
 So, you can't just like tickle it on its tummy or anything.

815
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,840
 They hate a tummy tingle.

816
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,840
 Oh.

817
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,840
 So, don't do that.

818
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,840
 And if you drop a trancheter, it'll almost certainly die.

819
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,840
 Really?

820
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:35,760
 Yeah, this is the advice of the British Trancheter Society, which is a bit of a QI favourite,

821
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,280
 I think, because it was founded in the 1980s, but the woman who founded it was called

822
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,280
 Animal and Web, which--

823
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,280
 Oh, yeah.

824
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,280
 Yeah.

825
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,400
 That's going to make watching Home Alone again a more harrowing experience, knowing that that

826
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:51,240
 tarantula that gets loose and gets dropped, and I mean, they must have had a stunt spider

827
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:55,760
 dressed as a tarantula, if that's the case, because he would have burst open in some

828
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,760
 of the scenes.

829
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,320
 I think you're assuming too much knowledge of Home Alone from some of us.

830
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,320
 Home Alone?

831
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,320
 I can't immediately remember the tarantula scene.

832
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,320
 Oh, you're on stage, though.

833
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,320
 Yeah.

834
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:07,240
 The only thing I remember is Kevin with his hands to his face, screaming, because he's

835
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,240
 been left home alone.

836
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,240
 Yeah.

837
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,240
 So you've memorized the poster.

838
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,240
 That's not-- sorry.

839
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,240
 I'm going to have to catch you again.

840
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,240
 He's not screaming because he's left home alone.

841
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,240
 He's screaming because he put aftershave on his face.

842
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,240
 Yeah.

843
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,240
 We'll see.

844
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,240
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

845
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,240
 He's pretending because he saw his dad screaming like that.

846
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,240
 I don't think so.

847
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:26,240
 And then you suggestively in the poster, so I mean, he looked like he's screaming at the

848
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,240
 two robbers who were either side of him, in the famous poster, but in the context of the

849
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,240
 film, he's never screaming.

850
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:34,240
 I have an extremely clear, extremely fake memory.

851
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,240
 His mom screams.

852
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,240
 His mom sits up on the phone and goes, "Kevin, that's--."

853
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,240
 Does he not say-- no, he doesn't say "Kevin."

854
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,240
 Why did he say his own name?

855
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,240
 Does he make any sense?

856
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,240
 I still think you're right, though.

857
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,240
 [LAUGHTER]

858
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,240
 What about in home alone, too?

859
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,240
 Does he do it there?

860
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,240
 No, because he's lost in New York.

861
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,240
 And that--

862
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,240
 Although she says Kevin again in a scream.

863
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,240
 You know, in the Edward Monks, the scream.

864
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,240
 Does he do it?

865
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,240
 No, that's actually--

866
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,240
 He's just put aftershave lives.

867
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,240
 Yeah.

868

 [MUSIC PLAYING]

869
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,240
 OK, that is it.

870
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,240
 That is all of our facts.

871
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,240
 Thank you so much for listening.

 Or you can go to our group account at no such thing or Facebook page.

 No such thing as a fish or our website.

884
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,240
 No such thing as a fish.com.

885
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,240
 Alex designed it.

886
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,240
 Thanks, Alex.

887
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,240
 Has everything linked to our tour, our new book.

888
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:40,740
 It's got a behind-the-scenes documentary called Behind the Gills, which shows how we act on

889
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:41,740
 tour.

890
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:42,740
 It's a lot of ironing.

891
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:46,240
 And everything else of all of previous episodes and so on is up there.

892
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,240
 So check it out.

893
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,240
 No such thing as a fish.com.

894
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,240
 We're going to be back again next week with another episode.

895
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,240
 We'll see you then.

896
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,240
 Goodbye.
