00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.080
 Hello and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.360
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.400
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with Anna Gisinski, James Harkin and Alex

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.440
 Bell and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.180
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.840
 Starting with my fact this week, my fact is that a message in a bottle that was thrown

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.080
 off the Titanic as it was sinking was found one year later washed up on a shore in Ireland

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.000
 only a few miles from the home of the man who threw it.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.940
 It's pretty extraordinary so this could be that he just dropped it on his way to the Titanic.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.800
 So this was a 19 year old, he was called Jeremiah Burke, he was from Glenmeyer County

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:12.440
 Cork in Ireland and the way that they were able to verify the bottle because there's been

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.840
 a lot of forgery bottles that were claimed to be so people trying to make money.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.680
 This bottle was a bottle of holy water that his mother had given to him a sort of good

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.320
 luck thing and he used one of his own shoelaces to tie it up as he threw the letter and the

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.760
 bottle overboard saying this didn't fucking work, mum, they've sent me a better good luck

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.760
 charm next time.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.620
 Yeah so the message has a date on it, it's slightly unclear so it could be the 10th, 12th, 13th.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.620
 We know that it's sunk on the morning of the 15th but so I don't know why he would have...

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.120
 Yeah, that doesn't make sense.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.120
 It's very odd.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.640
 I think at the best of times I don't necessarily know what data is straight away.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.520
 I think as you're going down with a Titanic, maybe you're going...

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.520
 What date is it guys?

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.520
 What date is it?

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.520
 Oh yeah.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.520
 The person next to you is clean of dear life.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.520
 Sorry, do you know what date is it?

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.520
 Is it Monday?

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.400
 But yeah, so this bottle washed up and I've looked at it on Google Maps.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.760
 It is literally just a couple of miles separate where the area of where they lived right to

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.320
 this shore and it was found by a coachman who found it and I didn't get to the bottom of

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.320
 this bit of the story but presumably knew the area, knew the people in the area and thought

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:21.500
 "Ah, this guy, you know, he's said "Burk of Glenmare Cork, I know this family, I know the

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.500
 burks.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.500
 I'm going to see if this is him."

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.960
 And so delivered it to the mother who a year later received this bottle.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.840
 You could argue that it was a hoax at the same time.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.440
 It's only been reported in the last few years properly again since it happened because

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.320
 they've been lending it to a museum so they didn't sell it, didn't go through auctions,

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.120
 it's been a family heirloom since.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.520
 Yeah, I suppose the natural currents would take it there anyway, wouldn't it?

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.520
 I suppose so.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.920
 Yeah, kind of the obvious place for it to end up.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.640
 So where did the Titanic launch from Liverpool, was it?

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.400
 It went from Southampton, then I think it went to France and then it went to Ireland and

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.480
 its last stop off was in Ireland, I think.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.480
 Was it?

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.000
 I didn't know that, all right.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.800
 But yeah, it was such a weird coincidence but it's so weird how many messages and bottles

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.160
 or maybe it's not weird how many messages and bottles do get tossed overboard and found

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.240
 and there are so many great stories.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:17.800
 So another really good message in bottle coincidence that I liked is that in April 2012, UK fisherman

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.720
 called Andrew Leeper was fishing near Shetland and he found a message in a bottle and it was

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.640
 a note that had been dropped at sea in 1890 and it was one of those that wanted to investigate

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.040
 ocean currents so oceanographers were always doing this to investigate where the messages

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.120
 ended up to see what the ocean currents were like.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:41.080
 Anyway, Andrew Leeper found this message in a bottle in 2012 and so it was and it was

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.480
 really nice because that meant it was the 315th to be put in that log started in 1890.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.320
 So 315 of those messages had been retrieved.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.080
 And it's still going, the log is still, I think.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.080
 It's still keeping log going.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.080
 Oh my god.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.960
 Some incredibly border searchers still sitting there, having this town.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.960
 Yeah, desperately waiting.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:57.960
 Every 40 years.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.800
 But what I liked about this guy was that he then broke the record for that's the longest

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.360
 weight anyone's ever had to read a message in a bottle and the previous record holder had

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:12.240
 been his mate Mark Anderson who'd broken it in 2006 in the same boat.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.240
 So what?

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.240
 How weird is that?

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.480
 So he's friends with him and he did like Leeper didn't interview with the papers when he

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.800
 then broke his friend's record and he said, my friend Anderson is very unhappy that I've

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:26.040
 topped his record as Anderson never stopped bloody talking about it.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:32.720
 And if anything screams hoax, I'm not suspicious of that one.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.760
 In 1954 I was just looking up other bottles that have been chucked in rather than found.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.360
 Guinness decided to do an advertising promotion.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:48.000
 And they threw 50,000 bottles into the ocean with messages in Guinness bottles, which I find

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 unbelievable.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.680
 So it's known as being Guinness's longest advertising campaign yet because they're still turning

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.680
 up.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.480
 But I can't believe that would never be allowed today.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.440
 I'm jumping 50,000 bottles in the ocean.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.880
 It's illegal in a lot of places, yeah, well, it definitely is.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.440
 So you'll get fined in Canada for $5,000 if you throw a bottle into the water.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.760
 We found this out because it was a story this year of a guy called Harold Hackett from Prince

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.080
 Edward Island.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:17.200
 And he's throwing an estimated 10,000 messages into the ocean since he started.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.720
 And he said he has to retire because he doesn't want to get arrested.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.520
 Well, no, arrest it, but find.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.520
 Yeah, yeah.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.520
 I don't know.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.640
 If that's all his life meant to him, throwing messages in bottles into the ocean.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.960
 I have a limited sympathy with someone like it was my life dream to pollute the ocean.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.440
 I can't believe that the government is moving.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.560
 In the 16th century, it was also illegal to open a bottle if you found it.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.560
 Yeah, I never found evidence of that.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.560
 I think that's it.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.560
 Yeah.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.840
 Is this the whole Queen Victoria having a Queen Elizabeth?

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.080
 I'm sorry, Queen Elizabeth having an uncorker of messages.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.920
 I think she did have that because it's mentioned in a Victor Hugo novel.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.440
 I think that was the first mention and that was like two, a hundred years later.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.440
 Oh, okay.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.440
 No, she can't have had an uncorker.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.720
 But it's not, that's not at least a modern invention, is it?

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.720
 No.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.440
 I think I think fate needs to exist, even if Victor Hugo is penning it.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.440
 That's true.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.440
 In his novel.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.440
 Yeah.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.440
 In his vicious novel.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.880
 I don't know how many Victor Hugo novels you've read, but there is a lot of extremely

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.080
 boring technical, true stuff there.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.080
 I really, yeah.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.040
 Naturally, you'll get like three chapters of the sewage systems of Paris, and so on like.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.040
 Oh, okay.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.040
 Oh, no.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.120
 James's resentment comes out about the fact that he's been reading the same Victor Hugo novel

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.120
 for a year.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.120
 Which is genuinely true, right?

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.120
 How is it going?

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.160
 If anyone here remembers was talking about Victor Hugo, it was probably about six months

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.160
 ago.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:38.040
 Yeah, that was on our 2018 tour at like, and I'm still reading "Lay Viserato".

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.040
 Yeah.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.200
 With the latest sort of modern instance that I read of this uncorker, comes down to

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:48.160
 a 1978 book called "The 12 Million Dollar Note" by Robert Crask in it.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.040
 There's true stories, and then there are also hoax stories.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.020
 And the thought is, is that this was in the book as a hoax story, but it got mixed up in

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.120
 all the reviews and so on when people were talking about this.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.920
 It's a true story, and then this is a hoax, and that's why it's spread.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:06.080
 So the idea just to explain that she had an official uncorker of bottles because Queen Elizabeth

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.800
 first didn't want anyone else uncorking bottles that contained secret information.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.800
 Yeah.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.760
 It was found, wasn't it, that was thrown from a Navy ship, supposedly, that had military

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.840
 details that were very classified.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:23.240
 As if anyone was throwing bottles over, they would often be people who were in the Navy

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:27.920
 or doing official work for the government, right, checking out currents and stuff like that.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.640
 So they didn't want just anyone to be able to read them.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.160
 And I don't know.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.640
 I know what you mean, and I think your right to be skeptical, and it's probably not true.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:39.760
 But I don't think it's necessarily true that we're saying that one person had this as his

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.400
 only job or anything.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:45.240
 It could be someone who was part of the Royal Household who also had this job, or…

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:52.040
 It's Green of the Stool on the side, he's official uncorker of various royal things.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:57.320
 Yeah, so this idea of doing scientific experiments for the sake of finding out ocean currents

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:01.840
 and stuff by dropping messages in bottles in actually serves a purpose, which seems so

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:02.840
 weird to me.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:07.320
 So there was this guy George Parker Bitter, who threw a thousand bottles into the North Sea

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:12.800
 in 1906, and he promised a shilling reward for anyone who found the bottle and then sent

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.840
 it back to him, saying exactly where they'd found it.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:19.640
 And in fact, one woman found the last one in 2015, and she posted it back to the address.

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:23.840
 And the company in Plymouth, that was still monitoring it, had to then track down a shilling

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:24.840
 and all shilling.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:29.120
 Right, looking on eBay and old anti-coing collectors to centre.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.120
 That's so funny.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:35.440
 Actually, the first ever message in a bottle possibly might have been for that reason,

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:40.200
 which was supposedly Greek philosopher Theo Frastus, who wanted to prove that the Mediterranean

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.080
 was fed by the Atlantic.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:46.840
 And so he put bottles in the Atlantic and saw them go round the corner into the med, and

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:47.840
 he could prove that.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.400
 Again, this is a slightly not sure if this is true or not.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.680
 And did he leave a message saying, whoever finds us, can you tell me the location?

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.680
 Pretty much, right?

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:55.680
 That's the idea.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.680
 That's cool.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.520
 And he saw them go round the corner, did you see?

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:02.480
 No, I think again, this is possibly not true, but he would have put them in the water,

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:07.320
 and then there would have been, like, dance as a message, saying, "Contact, Theo Frastus

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.320
 on..."

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.320
 You know?

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.320
 075.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.720
 075 out of the square happens.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:17.920
 There was a thing on, like, the US government, noticals like, which said that a lot of the

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:21.560
 nautical maps we have now are based on those messages.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:27.000
 So in the 1950s, I think loads of messages in bottles were put in the Gulf of Maine.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.320
 And all the maps we have of, like, all the different ocean currents there, basically

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:34.360
 based on where everyone picked all those messages up, and where, and, you know, then they sent

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.360
 back saying, "Hey, I'm here.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.360
 I've just found this."

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.080
 And that's where a lot of ocean maps come from.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.200
 And now we've got, like, satellite technology and stuff.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:44.200
 Also, I think quite recently I'm sure we must have mentioned this, but there was all those

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:49.280
 rubber ducks that fell off a tanker, and they floated around everywhere, and we got loads

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.280
 of data from that.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.280
 Yeah, really?

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.280
 So that's still happening.

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.280
 Yeah.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.280
 I think they still wash up every now and then.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.280
 Yeah, they do.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.280
 Yeah.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.280
 I read an article.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:02.680
 I read mental floss article all about messages and bottles, and then the article veers away

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:06.720
 because this isn't technically a message and a bottle, but it's a pretty extraordinary story.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.920
 So I'm just going to read it anyway.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.440
 This happened in 2001.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:14.600
 There was a girl called Laura Bucston, and she was coming up to 10 years old.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.160
 She released a red balloon into the air.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.760
 She lived in Stoke on Trent in England.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.600
 And on the balloon, she wrote, "Please return to Laura Bucston."

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.760
 And on the other side of the balloon, she put her home address.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.000
 So they released it into the air.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 It disappeared.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:34.680
 A few weeks later, 140 miles away, the balloon hit a hedge when it came down.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:40.880
 And the person who picked it up saw the name and saw the address and immediately went what

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:44.560
 the hell was going on and went to his neighbor because his neighbor had a daughter who was

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.720
 10 years old who also had the name Laura Bucston.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:51.320
 So it landed exactly with the same age, same name, the person.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.600
 They got in contact, and they were saying, "What amazing coincidence.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.600
 Let's meet up."

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:59.200
 So on the day of the meeting, the two girls, independently without having decided what

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.480
 they were going to do, both came in the same outfit.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.760
 They both had a pink sweater and were wearing jeans.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:04.760
 jeans.

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:05.760
 Oh my goodness.

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:06.760
 Oh my goodness.

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:10.520
 This is just collecting all the qubits that happened at the moment.

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:14.680
 They were both roughly the same height, which was like two girls the same age and roughly

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:15.680
 the same height.

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.440
 So they were tall ten-year-olds.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:18.440
 So they were very surprised.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.440
 Oh, you're a tall ten-year-old.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.440
 Tiny little qubits.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:21.440
 Yes.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.440
 No.

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:23.440
 I like pizza.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.440
 They both had brown hair.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.440
 They wore it in the same style.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:28.680
 They both had three-year-old black Labrador retrievers.

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:33.240
 They both had a gray pet rabbit, not on them, they left them out.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:39.040
 They both brought, they did bring their own guinea pigs, which were the same color, and

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:42.160
 had the same orange markings on their high quarters.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.880
 This is mental floss, so I know it sounds like I'm reading an April fool's thing, but this

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:46.880
 is...

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:50.680
 But also, like, if that was in a local news story, I'm a journalist in a local news story

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:51.680
 and still come trend.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.680
 I would go and go, "Come on, give me some more.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:54.680
 What have you got?

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:55.680
 You have a dog?"

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:56.680
 Yeah.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:57.680
 Okay.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:58.680
 What is on local, as well?

00:11:58.680 --> 00:11:59.680
 Yeah, exactly.

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:00.680
 What color-haired does she have?

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:01.680
 Brilliant.

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:02.680
 Nice one.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:03.680
 Yeah.

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:04.680
 Can I just say this?

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:05.680
 I don't know why these two are being like this.

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:06.680
 They must have woken up on the wrong side of their bed.

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:07.680
 Because that does happen sometimes.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:08.680
 Sure.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:09.680
 I mean, mental things.

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.280
 I suppose you could say the law of large numbers means that there's enough things that happen

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:15.680
 in the world, which aren't coincidental, that some coincidental things do happen sometimes.

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:16.680
 Yeah.

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.680
 Thousands of lower boxers pick up fan balloons every day.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:19.680
 It does happen not to be wearing the same clothes.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:24.000
 But I thought we should still get excited by coincidences.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.520
 I know it's like, "Oh, this could happen anyway."

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:26.520
 It's still amazing.

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:27.520
 Yeah.

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:31.000
 I think maybe we did get out of bed on the wrong side, but on the other hand, did you not

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.760
 when you're a kid release loads of balloons with notes on them and never get a single fucking

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:36.760
 reply from anyone?

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:37.760
 Yeah.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:38.760
 Is that what you're attempting now?

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:39.760
 I'm never going to school.

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:40.760
 Yeah.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.040
 It was a very common thing for people to do when I was a kid.

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.840
 We don't do any more because it's like bad for the environment, but they used to be really

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:46.840
 involved to do that.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:47.840
 Didn't they?

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:48.840
 Everyone, do you write a note on your thing?

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:52.760
 We would use to go to Tiggies for our birthday every year, which is an Italian restaurant

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:56.480
 in Bolton, and then we'd get a free balloon, and then we'd write a note on it.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.480
 Yeah.

00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:58.480
 Yeah, same.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.480
 Every birthday party.

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:02.320
 Some bastard in Bolton was shooting them down over there.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:06.720
 Did you really go to Scotland for shared with thousands of labels of dead balloons that James

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:07.720
 Arkansas couldn't name one?

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:12.240
 There was one person, the one girl who did it and landed in the bag on the Buckingham Palace

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.240
 and the Queen Centre Park.

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.240
 Did you remember that?

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.240
 Did you?

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.240
 She was called Elizabeth Windsor.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:20.240
 And she was 90-year-old girl from bookstore.

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:24.480
 And they both turned out wearing crowns.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:33.880
 You've got a beefy to do.

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:39.040
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Alex.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:44.960
 My fact this week is that the original mastermind to chair was specially modified to have detachable

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:49.720
 arms, quote, "in case a contender is too large to fit between them."

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:54.280
 Oh, OK, so we're going to explain what mastermind is for non-British people.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:58.120
 Yes, so it's a long-running quiz show.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:00.040
 It's been running since 1972.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.160
 It's a very like paired back quiz show.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:06.680
 So it's a dark studio, you have a person asking questions, and you have four contestants,

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:11.160
 and they each come up to a chair one at a time, and the chair is the kind of the famous symbol

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.840
 of the show.

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:16.680
 And each contestant is asked a specialist subject, so yeah, prepare a specialist subject.

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:21.480
 So if you know, for example, Titanic facts and everything about it, you would get quizzed

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:25.320
 in a very quick space of time, everything about the Titanic and the more point to get you

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:26.320
 in.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.320
 It's like an expert quiz.

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.320
 Yeah, exactly.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:33.440
 And it was based on a guy who was in the war, in Second World War, he was Nare F. Gunner,

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:39.720
 and he was captured in Germany and questioned by the Germans, and it's kind of supposed to

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:43.720
 be almost the same way that he felt at the time, which is you've got a big light on

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:47.360
 you, they're asking you questions again and again and again, to kind of put you under as much

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.360
 pressure as possible.

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.360
 Yeah.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.440
 Yeah, his name was Bill Wright, and yeah, exactly that.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:55.040
 He was a prisoner of war, and he thought, oh, this will make a great game show.

00:14:55.040 --> 00:15:02.800
 He was being interrogated by the Nazis, and interestingly, he says in Germany, so you

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:06.480
 were asked three questions, which is name, rank, and number.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:11.200
 And that's still the thing that in Mastermind, it's name, occupation, and specialist subject.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:15.080
 He took the rule of three that they, and he directly associates it with that.

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:19.800
 And when they started it, Magnus Magnuson, who is the original host of the show, and his

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:23.520
 name is, he's Icelandic, so that's a nice, Icelandic name, Magnus Magnuson.

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:25.040
 Do you know what his dad's name was?

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.040
 No, I don't.

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:27.040
 What his dad's first name was.

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.040
 Yeah.

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.040
 It was not Magnus.

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.040
 No, so I changed it.

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:35.200
 Yeah, in Iceland, it's supposed to be your surname is son of your father, so my dad's

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.480
 called Michael, so I should be James Michelson.

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:38.480
 Right.

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.160
 His father was called Anna.

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:42.320
 Seagrstein, wasn't he?

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.320
 Seagrstein.

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:48.280
 So he should have been Seagrsteinson, but actually his father was called Seagrstein Magnuson,

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:52.000
 and in Scotland, of course, you have the same surname as your father, so he had to keep the

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 same surname.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 Oh, okay.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 Wow.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 That's very interesting.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:02.720
 So, yeah, so Magnus, usually you'd be a quiz host or, you know, you'd have a title like

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:03.720
 that.

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:06.720
 His title, when he was doing the show, was the interrogator, so that's what he was

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:07.720
 introduced at.

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.720
 He was completely tied into his experience.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.080
 And he was actually a Nazi as well, wasn't he, Magnus Magnuson?

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.080
 He was, yeah.

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.080
 Was he?

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.080
 No.

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.080
 Geez.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.080
 No, he was a national treasure.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.080
 I thought I missed that paragraph, and I was reading it to this.

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:22.520
 You don't know what's weird, though, is that another little link in that I know from

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:24.560
 our friend who was on Mastermind.

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:29.400
 So Ian Dunn, who's a big fan of QI, and who we know, he went on Mastermind, and he said,

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:33.080
 "When you fill in the forms, when you're saying what your specialist subject should

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.640
 be, it's called the Mastermind SS form.

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:36.640
 They have a stop."

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.640
 That's very funny.

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:43.600
 I read on Wikipedia, they have a list of a few subjects that have actually been rejected.

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:47.960
 A few of the ones that have been rejected include Roots to Anywhere in Mainland Britain by

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.920
 Road from Letchworth.

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:54.440
 The banana industry, not allowed to pick the banana industry, as you're...

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:56.440
 Not allowed to pick it.

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:57.440
 Nice.

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:01.960
 A orthopedic bone cement in total hip replacement is another.

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:07.080
 The last word of the wiki is Perfect Squares up to 99 Squared.

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:09.280
 What is a Perfect Squared on?

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:17.860
 It's 9,801, but that's one point.

00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:22.440
 In recent years, I read in an article that subjects like faulty towers, black adder, rolled

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:28.600
 dull, harry potter, so they've been ruled out because so many people have picked it that

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:30.480
 they've run out of questions, basically.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:33.680
 They don't know what else to ask about black adder that's not been done before.

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:39.240
 The thing with harry potter is that last year, 262 people wanted to do it as a specialist

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:44.320
 subject on Mastermind, that's according to producer Mark Helzby.

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:48.880
 The first three winners were women, which was quite bizarre because far fewer women than

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:54.480
 men have ended up winning the titles, not because women are less clever because of centuries

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.920
 and centuries of systemic oppression blah blah blah.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:07.520
 I would say that your specialist subjects is not fabulous, look, I believe it, it's just

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:09.240
 a long explanation to go into.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:13.800
 But yeah, the first three people who won were women and then in 35 years, it's been eight

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:17.600
 women and 21 men who won it, but after the first three years, everyone was speculating

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.440
 is a man ever going to win Mastermind.

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.040
 Can we talk about the chair very quickly?

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:23.040
 Yes.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:30.600
 The chair was voted in a survey for House Beautiful magazine as the second greatest chair, basically,

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:31.600
 of pop culture.

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:33.920
 Or can we guess the first?

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.800
 Yeah, have a go, yeah.

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:40.120
 Just one extra bit of context, this is, it was voted as the second most iconic chair of

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:41.120
 the 20th century.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:44.280
 I was going to say the wool second, the house of lords or whatever it is.

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.120
 Is it a sofa from friends?

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:47.120
 No, it's not.

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.120
 Okay, so it's...

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:49.120
 Is it in pop culture, right?

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.120
 Is it chair?

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:51.120
 The singer.

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.120
 No, it's in.

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:55.640
 Okay, so I'm going to say it's the 1960s.

00:18:55.640 --> 00:19:00.120
 It is a chair that made the newspapers because it was a scandalous...

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.120
 Nixon.

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.240
 It was a scandalous chair, basically.

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:04.240
 Scandalist chair.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.240
 Elvis.

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:06.240
 Elvis.

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:07.240
 Did he have a chair?

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.240
 Didn't need it.

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:09.240
 So if you just had Elvis in it.

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.240
 He died on the toilet, yeah.

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.240
 They often call it the throne.

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:12.240
 Yeah.

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:13.240
 That's true.

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:14.240
 Well, no.

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.440
 Is it the chair that Liza Monelli sat on in that film?

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:17.440
 Is that 1960s?

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:21.040
 No, it's not, but it's interesting, have a think in your head about what she does with

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:24.040
 that chair and you might get to it somehow.

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:25.040
 Is it Chicago?

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:26.040
 You're thinking...

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.040
 She sits backwards.

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:29.040
 Does someone sit backwards on it in an iconic photo?

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:30.040
 We are so close.

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.040
 Is it Marilyn Monroe?

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:32.040
 No, that's it.

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.040
 No, it's Christine Keeler.

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.040
 Yeah, we go Profumo.

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:35.040
 Profumo.

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.040
 Yes, one of those.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:37.040
 Nice.

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:42.280
 Yeah, so that got voted the Christine Keeler sitting backwards on a chair as the most iconic.

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:45.080
 Very much that was more about Keeler than the chair.

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:50.880
 Except in its time, most comedians would parody that shot and still do of being

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:53.880
 naked on a chair that way round in reference to that.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.880
 I think for that reason that chair is the concept of the chair.

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:57.880
 Yeah, exactly.

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:01.880
 I can picture the picture you're talking about, which I think means it counts.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:02.880
 We'll allow it.

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:07.880
 So the last chair on Mastermind was given to Magnus Magnus and when he retired.

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:11.520
 They've got a new one now, which like Alex says, has these detachable arms.

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:13.920
 It is an Eames soft pad.

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:19.560
 It was designed in 1969 and it was designed by Charles and Ray Eames, who are basically

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:22.600
 the best chair designers in the history of the world.

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:24.200
 He's like Trumpish of you.

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.200
 Yeah.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.200
 I have his chairs.

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:27.200
 They make great chairs.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:28.200
 They are the famous.

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.840
 They're the big names in chairs.

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:34.280
 They were a husband and wife couple and they made loads of mass-produced chairs.

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:38.880
 And the first thing they ever mass-produced was a molded plywood leg splint for World

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:44.520
 War II, which they gave to all the soldiers and it was molded on Charles' own leg.

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:47.280
 And they sold 150,000 of them.

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:51.760
 So there were soldiers all around the world walking on an exact replica of his own leg.

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:52.760
 Wow.

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:53.760
 That's amazing.

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:54.760
 That's incredible.

00:20:54.760 --> 00:21:01.600
 My favorite TV chair is the chair that was in the audition room when Robin Williams went

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:06.800
 audition for the role of Mork from Ork on Happy Days.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:09.560
 So I think that spun off into Mork and Mindy, didn't it?

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:13.000
 But the producer was a guy called Gary Marshall and Robin Williams came into the room and

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.440
 he was unknown at the time, walked in and Gary Marshall was told him to take a seat

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:20.560
 and immediately Robin Williams went to the chair and stood on his head on it and Marshall

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.720
 immediately hired him, saying he was the only alien who applied for the job, so.

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:24.720
 Wow.

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:25.720
 It's cool.

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:29.640
 Those stories are quite dangerous because it encourages literally everyone to go into

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.120
 audition and really break the mold.

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:34.760
 And can you imagine saying that for hours after every single person comes in and does something

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:36.080
 really annoying with the chair?

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:38.160
 You're the only one who sat on the chair.

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:39.160
 That was the test.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.160
 Do you want to tell you?

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:41.160
 We're not looking for actual aliens.

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.160
 We need an actor.

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:46.560
 We need somebody who's going to be easy to work with, to do the same form as time after time

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:56.600
 and love will take.

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:57.600
 Okay.

00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:00.480
 It is time for fact number three and that is Chazinski.

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:04.600
 My fact this week is that one competition at the Highland Games used to be pulling the

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.160
 legs off a cow in order to win a sheep.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:11.120
 Therfs really hard in Scotland out late because when I was at school, I used to pull legs

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:15.640
 off a daddy long legs, but in Scotland they pull legs off a cow.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:20.080
 It sounds like a metaphor for like ruining something because a cow is more valuable than a sheep,

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:22.240
 so why don't you just keep the cow and leave the legs on?

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:25.080
 So the cow is dead at this point, I should say.

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:28.160
 So it's not as awful, still quite awful.

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:29.560
 Yeah, it's pretty pretty, really bad.

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:30.560
 It's not ideal.

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:33.800
 It's a strength test and it would be impressive if someone could twist the legs off a cow

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:34.800
 with his own bare hands.

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:37.920
 So emotional strength test as well to witness what you've just done to this poor cow?

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:42.200
 If you ever see Anna in the country side and you want to impress her.

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:53.920
 This was actually invented in 1820 and I don't think it was that long-lasting, but the idea

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:57.880
 of the contest was invented by a guy called Alistair McDonnell who was a clan chief and apparently

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:03.760
 he was just this really cool eccentric, vibrant clan chiefed in character.

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:08.560
 In fact, he was the character of Fergus McIver in the Waverly, Walter Scott's Waverly novel

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:12.920
 was based on and yeah, he said let's do this, that'll be fun and the first prize is a fat

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:13.920
 sheep.

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:14.920
 Okay.

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:18.520
 And the reason it didn't last probably is because it was extremely difficult.

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:19.520
 Yes.

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:24.000
 I read one, I don't think it might have happened maybe once or twice in one or two different

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.040
 ones, but the one that I read was in Invergari and there was only one man who succeeded after

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:35.040
 struggling for about an hour as a reward he received his sheep and the eulogistic speech

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.040
 from the chief.

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.040
 Nice.

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:39.760
 Has anyone been to the Highland games?

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:40.760
 No.

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:41.760
 I have been.

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:42.760
 Yeah, it's really awesome.

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:43.760
 It's really good.

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:44.760
 It's almost like a fate.

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:49.200
 The one that I went to is like a village fate, but then you've also got these incredible

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:54.480
 things happening where people throw in these massive weights really, really high.

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:55.480
 Like really high.

00:23:55.480 --> 00:24:01.160
 The big logs, the big, I saw the paper tossing, the main one I saw, they were like, they had

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:05.160
 these kind of, you know, like kettlebells that you would use in the gym and we're throwing

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:08.680
 this over a big, big, big, high height.

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:09.680
 Wow.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:10.680
 I was really impressed.

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:12.080
 Is it kind of like high jump?

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:13.080
 Is there a bar?

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:14.080
 Yeah.

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:16.160
 So we get higher and higher and higher at the time.

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.640
 And the paper toss is not about how far you can toss it.

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:23.240
 It's about, you have to toss it so that it lands at 12 o'clock so it lands upright.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:27.880
 So it's got to stay up in the air for like an hour and a half who's jumping in the morning.

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:29.520
 Depending on time you throw it.

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:31.000
 Don't throw it at 9 a.m.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.440
 It's not, yeah, as in it lands, like, facing away from you, is it worth it?

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:37.440
 Yes.

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:40.880
 So you need to do a full rotation of 180 and then land exactly facing away from you, don't

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:41.880
 land.

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:42.880
 Exactly, perpendicular to the earth.

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:43.880
 Yes.

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:47.920
 Ah, so it would be extremely hard to pull the leg off a cow, right?

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:49.400
 I think they'd twisted.

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.000
 People tend to say twist quite a lot.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.000
 And is that, is that how you pull it?

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.360
 I think that is how you would do it, yeah.

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.360
 I think so.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:57.840
 Let's say you want to pull a chicken leg off a chicken.

00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:58.840
 Yeah.

00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:00.600
 You tend to give it a twist while you're pulling, don't you?

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.080
 I can see what you're saying, actually.

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:03.080
 I can picture that now.

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:06.320
 Do you know the ideal shape for a cow right in the 19th century?

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.320
 We've got four legs for us, don't we?

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:12.800
 Well, unless it's kind of square because I can't really picture cows because I can't

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:13.800
 picture anything.

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.920
 But if I ever had to draw one, I'd draw it particularly square for an animal, right?

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:22.680
 And that's, if you picture drawings in the 19th century, then cows would be vast and very

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:23.680
 square.

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:27.520
 And there was a lot of competition between members of the ability and landowners about getting

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:29.160
 the right shape of your animals.

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:31.920
 So yeah, if you look at cows, they don't look like real cows.

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:37.120
 And the actual, the size of a cow between 1710 and 1795 increased by a third.

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.480
 So people were really building up their cows.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.000
 Sorry, what were the dates?

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 Between 1710 and 1795.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.800
 So that was when they started getting bigger.

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:44.400
 So it's only a couple of generations.

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:45.400
 Yeah, absolutely.

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:49.280
 But cows were supposed to be rectangular.

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:50.280
 Exactly rectangular.

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:54.600
 Sheep were supposed to tend towards being oblong and pigs, the ideal shape for a pig was

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:55.600
 a football shape.

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:57.720
 Well, what kind of football?

00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:02.760
 As in, in those days was F.A. regulation standards, black and white and eggs again.

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:03.760
 I think round.

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.480
 So if you get pictures of pigs very often, they'll be the picture with their stomachs

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:07.480
 literally on the floor.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:08.480
 Like a potbelly pig.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:11.280
 Because they've actually been to turn them into footballs, didn't they?

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:12.280
 Yeah, exactly.

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:13.280
 Pigs, butters.

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:14.280
 Yeah.

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:15.280
 So why were the cows square?

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:17.520
 Because usually when you make things square, it's that you can stack them.

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:19.320
 But I don't think they did that in a cow.

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:20.160
 A bit more in a little.

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:21.160
 Yeah.

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.160
 Well, this was just getting them bigger.

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:25.480
 And that was the shapes they tended towards.

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:31.200
 I read, just going back to the history of the Scotland Highland Games.

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:35.800
 I read that the very first one, so they don't know exactly where the first one occurred.

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:42.520
 But it is believed that one of the first early venues was at Fettoreso.

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:47.040
 And technically, it's a few miles south of the Scottish Highlands.

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:48.040
 So the first one made no sense.

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:49.040
 So the lowlands.

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:50.040
 It's in the lowlands.

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.000
 So it's actually the lowland games.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.080
 That's a really good find to history.

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:55.080
 If it's true.

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.080
 Yeah.

00:26:56.080 --> 00:27:00.600
 Unfortunately, as the article says, if it did happen there, it predates recorded history.

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:01.600
 We'll never know.

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:07.560
 Because really the first one, which is kind of a modern style, was in Brema in the early

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:12.840
 1800s. And it came at a time when the Scottish were kind of finding themselves.

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:15.920
 And that's when all that kind of tartan, it did exist.

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:18.880
 But it was when it was properly became like this in the last five days.

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.360
 But it's quite an informal type thing.

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:22.680
 There aren't the Highland Games.

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:25.360
 Or there weren't the Highland Games right at the same time.

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:27.760
 It's, yeah, it's more just like a festival type thing, isn't it?

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:28.760
 Yeah.

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:29.760
 Yeah.

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:30.760
 Various times over the summer.

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:31.760
 Every place will have one.

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:32.760
 And it's weird.

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:33.760
 It's not just these like any time I've thought of it.

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:34.760
 I've thought of throwing these giant logs.

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:37.240
 And as you say, the kettlebell style weights.

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:41.720
 But they do stuff like biggest bowl of porridge, you know, as a competition.

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:48.880
 And there was one that was made in 2010, that's the record, which is, it was 690 litres of

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:49.880
 porridge.

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:50.880
 So it was 2000 people.

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:54.480
 It was just by Goldilocks, who said, "This porridge is too small."

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:55.480
 So yeah.

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:58.800
 But it's all tourist as well, isn't it?

00:27:58.800 --> 00:27:59.800
 Yeah.

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:01.800
 No Scottish people have ever been to the Highland Games.

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:05.360
 And you know who, well, you know who used to go to it, Billy Conley all the time.

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:09.040
 And as a result, he used to bring his best mates along, who happened to be famous comedians

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:10.040
 as well.

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:15.040
 One of which, who went, was Robin Williams, just to bring all the alien chairman back into

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:16.040
 the conversation.

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:17.040
 Yeah.

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:28.720
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is James.

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:34.000
 My fact this week is that you can cure your arachnophobia by drawing pictures of smiling

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 spiders.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 So good.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 I'm actually going to try this.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 Can you read the full book?

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.000
 Yeah.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 Yeah, me too.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 Do you need to draw like a, like a, like a nude, like a life model kind of, do you need

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000
 the spider there?

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.160
 Well, they are always usually nude spiders, because they can't, they can't get trousers without

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:51.160
 legs.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:53.480
 So he drew like a sexy photo of a spider, with that make it less scary?

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:54.800
 Like a profumo sitting on a chair.

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:58.080
 He had four legs every time.

00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:02.840
 So this is a clinical hypnotherapist called Adam Cox.

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:08.320
 He is British, or he pretends he's in Britain, and he encourages his clients to draw brightly

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:13.040
 coloured, smiling spiders with big eyes, and he says that it reduces their feelings of

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:15.080
 anxiety towards the arachnids.

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:21.200
 But so does it cure you in a, you're, presumably it's not like, okay, I'm going to be encountering

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:23.280
 a spider in the next five minutes.

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:25.680
 I'm going to quickly draw a picture of a smiling one too.

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:29.640
 No, it's a long-term therapy, so people are going week after week and drawing more and

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:30.640
 more spiders.

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.720
 And eventually it makes them feel less anxious.

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:37.000
 It maybe sounds like the early stages of a very severe phobia treatment, so as in you can't

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.760
 even, because you know there are some phobias where you can't even say the word of the thing

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:43.040
 you're scared of, and the idea of drawing a spider is probably really scary and horrible

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:45.280
 and thinking about the details of it is probably part of it.

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:49.680
 Well, I am an arachnid phobia, a little bit not as much as I used to be as a kid, but I would

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:54.720
 always find it really hard to see a picture of them in a book, and even now on the internet

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:55.720
 I find it quite hard.

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:56.720
 I have to scroll past them.

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:57.720
 Me too.

00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:58.720
 Really?

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:00.600
 Yeah, just get it out of shot and just read the text.

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:04.320
 How do you have to research this background?

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:08.960
 So what's interesting as well as there was a study that was done in Queensland in Australia

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:13.480
 and along with a UK university in Sussex.

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:17.200
 And they were saying that if you have a fear of spiders, if you have arachnophobia, you

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:23.360
 are more likely to see a spider as in your hardwired, as they say, to notice the threats.

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:27.320
 So if you were out in Queensland and you were walking through the bush, if I'm walking

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:31.480
 with you and I'm less scared, I might not see a spider that's obviously there, but you

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.680
 are on edge waiting to see one.

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:36.040
 Yeah, actually, that's almost logical.

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:40.800
 I do have a problem with movement in general, so if I see any movement out the corner of

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:42.680
 my eye, it really freaks me out.

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:47.080
 And the reason they, their movement is particularly weird, because I think we mentioned recently,

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:51.080
 actually, how they move by hydraulic pressure, but I don't realise it was all spiders moving

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:52.080
 that way.

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:55.800
 So when they stretch their legs out, they're not doing it with their muscles at all.

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:58.960
 They're pumping blood out through their legs, which is why they move in that weird jerky

00:30:58.960 --> 00:30:59.960
 way.

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:04.520
 And that's why when they die, they always shrivel up, because the pressure disappears, so they

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:05.520
 shrivel up.

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:09.120
 So basically, when they run, they have to have an erection in every one of their legs.

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:10.120
 That's exactly it, yeah.

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:11.120
 Wow.

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:13.320
 It's very quickly getting harder than not getting harder.

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:14.320
 Exactly.

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:15.320
 Yeah.

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:20.320
 Their genitals are hydraulic as well, by the way, so they operate with some hydraulic pressure.

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:23.840
 And also, they obviously have this really cool thing spider penises where they can keep

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:25.760
 on having sex without the spider.

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:30.640
 So there are quite a few spiders, like the all-web spider, which will start having sex with

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:34.960
 a lady spider, and then detaches its penis to get away, because I was a football.

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:35.960
 Have to take a call.

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:37.160
 I'm so sorry, I'll be back in a minute.

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:38.160
 You have this.

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:39.160
 Exactly.

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:43.320
 And it's actually more effective without its spider attachment.

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:48.080
 As soon as the spider leaves, the penises tend to eject about 70% of their sperm after

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:49.080
 that.

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:50.080
 So they keep pumping sperm out.

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.080
 Wow.

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:52.080
 Even when the spider's gone.

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:53.080
 Wow.

00:31:53.080 --> 00:32:00.320
 I was looking into general phobias, because obviously there are so many phobias out there, and I found

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:04.560
 this long list just to see which ones are actual phobias, because there must be a phobia for

00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:08.800
 everything, but there's a limitation, obviously, on ones that have been given names.

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:09.800
 Yeah.

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:13.520
 So the ones that I found that I thought were quite interesting that have actual names

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:14.840
 assigned to them.

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:17.520
 There's a phobia for the fear of opinions.

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:19.160
 That's very interesting.

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.160
 I'm just fearful.

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:23.000
 I'm just really sure what I think about that.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.520
 There is the fear of flutes.

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:30.120
 When you say there is, as in a guy on the internet, decide to attribute names to one of the

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:31.120
 fears.

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:34.600
 No, so this is a big list that a guy wrote.

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:35.600
 Phobia.

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:39.440
 Not Wikipedia is called something like phobia, weirdphobias.com was something like that.

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:43.200
 I think that's a really difficult thing, isn't it, because there's a list of millions

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.200
 of them.

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:47.720
 There's like someone wrote one about a fear of a doc secretly looking at you or something

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:49.880
 like that, which is obviously not true.

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:52.800
 Then on the other hand, there are such weird ones that are true.

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:55.160
 It's really hard to tell which ones are enough.

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:57.240
 So, like, phobia is definitely a thing.

00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:58.240
 Is it?

00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.240
 Being scared of ferns.

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:01.200
 I think quite a few famous people have got that.

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:03.040
 Furn cotton, which is very difficult for her.

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:04.040
 Yeah.

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.040
 I think she's scared of cotton as well.

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:06.040
 Yeah.

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:08.480
 And fear of like holes and stuff like that is really common.

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:09.480
 Yes.

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:10.480
 I've heard of that one.

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:11.480
 I've heard of that one.

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:12.480
 I've heard of that one.

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:13.480
 I've heard of fear of chins.

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:14.480
 Do you reckon that's a real one?

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:15.480
 It's hard to imagine.

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:16.480
 But that's what I mean.

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:17.480
 It's hard to say whether it isn't.

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:18.480
 Yeah.

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:21.920
 You know, a guy had his arachnophobia accidentally removed quite recently.

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:27.080
 So, you can get rid of accidentally, but it does involve really invasive surgery.

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:29.840
 This was a guy who'd always been terrified of spiders.

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:33.400
 And then also he got an illness where he started having seizures.

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:36.080
 And so he went in for an operation to get rid of his seizures, and they had to remove

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:37.880
 a bit of his amygdala.

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:42.760
 And the surgery went really well, but he woke up and he found just two slight changes to

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:43.760
 his character.

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:47.480
 He had this stomach-lurching aversion to a very specific kind of music.

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:49.720
 So when he heard it, it was a music on a particular advert.

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:51.920
 He was terrified, just hated it.

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:54.040
 And he was no longer remotely afraid of spiders.

00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:55.720
 That's really useful, isn't it?

00:33:55.720 --> 00:34:01.800
 I have a fear of invasive brain surgery, though, so it's a bit worse than my fear of spiders.

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:02.800
 That's it.

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:09.600
 There's an organisation, a charity organisation in the UK called Triumph Overphobia, top UK.

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:17.160
 One of the managers is called Trilby Breckman, and Trilby Breckman runs self-help groups.

00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:18.760
 He sounds like a really cool guy.

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:23.480
 And he said, "We once had a guy who came to us for six weeks and never said a word."

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:24.800
 He just sat there.

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:29.680
 Then eventually he managed to say, "I've got a social phobia," and then ran out of the

00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:30.680
 room.

00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:31.680
 [laughter]

00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:32.680
 It's so good.

00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:33.680
 But, I mean, we shouldn't be laughing.

00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:34.680
 We wouldn't be listening.

00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:35.680
 And this just means it doesn't.

00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:36.680
 No.

00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:42.160
 Do you think I'll recommend a group therapy to a guy who's a fear of social environment?

00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:46.120
 It's okay to laugh, because he came back the following week, and within a year he was

00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:48.440
 running groups by himself as well.

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:49.920
 And now he's got a fear of being alone.

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:50.920
 [laughter]

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:52.800
 He's in the group all the time.

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:57.640
 I was looking up what, because I was like, "What a spider's scared of," because, you know,

00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:59.320
 everyone's scared of spiders.

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:03.740
 Most spiders are terrified of ants, because ants contain formic acid, which is really about

00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:04.740
 spiders.

00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:09.280
 And a lot of them will run for their lives if they see an ant, as it were.

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:13.120
 That's like a quote, like a researcher said, "It sort of run away."

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:18.640
 But the University of Canterbury found that they even run away from, some spiders will even

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:23.600
 run away from another species of spider called a jumping spider, which the gregarious jumping

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:25.560
 spider, which pretends to be an ant.

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:26.640
 That's its defense mechanism.

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:27.640
 Right.

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:28.640
 And it scares away other spiders.

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:29.640
 So, it hides its legs.

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:32.040
 I think we said that they hide that two of their legs, don't they?

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:35.660
 So, some species spiders do that, and pretend to be ants, and that scares other species

00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:36.660
 who are scared of ants.

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:37.660
 Wow.

00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:41.200
 Well, someone who's scared of spiders myself a little bit, if I was to dress as a massive

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:42.200
 ant.

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:44.520
 So, do you think that all kind of just leave me alone?

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:45.520
 Possibly.

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:50.480
 So, the spiders in the TV series, I'm a celebrity, get me out of here, must be feeling good

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:54.240
 this year, because they're going to be missing a big ant on the set this year.

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:55.240
 Oh, sorry.

00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:56.240
 Good.

00:35:56.240 --> 00:36:04.700
 Well, I do think you should never pick up a trancheter, because I hate them because I might

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:08.520
 ship myself, and if I ship myself, no one's going to hang out with me anyway.

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:09.520
 Right.

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:10.520
 That makes your social phobia even worse.

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:11.520
 Yeah.

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:12.520
 Because you'll scare them too much, and they'll die.

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:15.040
 It's similar, so it's for their sake.

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:19.120
 So, their abdomens are incredibly thin, and one little touch on the abdomen with your fingernail

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:21.440
 could split it open, and they'll spill their guts all over the place.

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.840
 So, you can't just like tickle it on its tummy or anything.

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:24.840
 They hate a tummy tingle.

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:25.840
 Oh.

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:26.840
 So, don't do that.

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:28.840
 And if you drop a trancheter, it'll almost certainly die.

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:29.840
 Really?

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:35.760
 Yeah, this is the advice of the British Trancheter Society, which is a bit of a QI favourite,

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:39.280
 I think, because it was founded in the 1980s, but the woman who founded it was called

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:41.280
 Animal and Web, which--

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:42.280
 Oh, yeah.

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:43.280
 Yeah.

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:47.400
 That's going to make watching Home Alone again a more harrowing experience, knowing that that

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:51.240
 tarantula that gets loose and gets dropped, and I mean, they must have had a stunt spider

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:55.760
 dressed as a tarantula, if that's the case, because he would have burst open in some

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:56.760
 of the scenes.

00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:59.320
 I think you're assuming too much knowledge of Home Alone from some of us.

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:00.320
 Home Alone?

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.320
 I can't immediately remember the tarantula scene.

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:02.320
 Oh, you're on stage, though.

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:03.320
 Yeah.

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:07.240
 The only thing I remember is Kevin with his hands to his face, screaming, because he's

00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:09.240
 been left home alone.

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:10.240
 Yeah.

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:11.240
 So you've memorized the poster.

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:12.240
 That's not-- sorry.

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:13.240
 I'm going to have to catch you again.

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:15.240
 He's not screaming because he's left home alone.

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:16.240
 He's screaming because he put aftershave on his face.

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:17.240
 Yeah.

00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:18.240
 We'll see.

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:19.240
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:20.240
 He's pretending because he saw his dad screaming like that.

00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:21.240
 I don't think so.

00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:26.240
 And then you suggestively in the poster, so I mean, he looked like he's screaming at the

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:30.240
 two robbers who were either side of him, in the famous poster, but in the context of the

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:31.240
 film, he's never screaming.

00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:34.240
 I have an extremely clear, extremely fake memory.

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:36.240
 His mom screams.

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:38.240
 His mom sits up on the phone and goes, "Kevin, that's--."

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:40.240
 Does he not say-- no, he doesn't say "Kevin."

00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:42.240
 Why did he say his own name?

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:43.240
 Does he make any sense?

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:45.240
 I still think you're right, though.

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:47.240
 [LAUGHTER]

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:49.240
 What about in home alone, too?

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:50.240
 Does he do it there?

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:51.240
 No, because he's lost in New York.

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:52.240
 And that--

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:53.240
 Although she says Kevin again in a scream.

00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:55.240
 You know, in the Edward Monks, the scream.

00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:56.240
 Does he do it?

00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:57.240
 No, that's actually--

00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:59.240
 He's just put aftershave lives.

00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:00.240
 Yeah.

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:05.240

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:07.240

 Thanks, Alex.

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:35.240
 Has everything linked to our tour, our new book.

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:40.740
 It's got a behind-the-scenes documentary called Behind the Gills, which shows how we act on

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:41.740
 tour.

00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:42.740
 It's a lot of ironing.

00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:46.240
