1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:09,440
 - Speaking of things under the water, as we were,

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,720
 and also kind of about space,

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,760
 there is a guy called Avi Loeb

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,080
 from the Harvard Smithsonian Center of Astrophysics,

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,560
 and he's currently looking under the water for some aliens.

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,400
 - So excited.

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,920
 - I knew that Dan would like this.

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,000
 So basically, do you remember there was this rock

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,320
 that came from outside the solar system

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,160
 when it was coming through?

12
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,560
 It's like a long cigar-shaped rock,

13
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,440
 and people thought it might have been an alien.

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,520
 I think it's called Uma Mora or something.

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,720
 - Uma Mora, yeah. - Yeah, something like that.

16
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,080
 Anyway, there's been another one,

17
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,440
 there was another previous one,

18
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,920
 and it was coming probably from outside the solar system,

19
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,360
 was going really, really fast,

20
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,040
 and it actually crashed into the Earth's atmosphere

21
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,280
 and went underwater.

22
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,400
 And this guy, Avi Loeb, wants to go and find it,

23
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,560
 ostensibly so he can study it

24
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,480
 and see kind of what rocks it is

25
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,800
 and what makes it up.

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,840
 But then he also says it could be a technological object

27
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,200
 created by aliens.

28
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,160
 - He believes it might be a beacon

29
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,920
 so that it's some sort of boop, boop, boop, boop.

30
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,520
 - That's how the second one arrived.

31
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,360
 - There you go.

32
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,240
 - The second one was following the beacon of the first one.

33
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,080
 - Oh, yeah.

34
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:13,920
 - Saw the state of Earth.

35
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,200
 I thought, "Oh, I'm actually just gonna pretend

36
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,040
 to be a rock."

37
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,520
 (all laughing)

38
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,560
 - He's actually so cool.

39
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,800
 - He's planning to go and find it.

40
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,080
 He's got a ship lined up.

41
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,800
 And one of the people who might be going on this trip is--

42
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,560
 - Dan Shriver.

43
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,720
 - I do a second podcast called The Cryptid Factor.

44
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,640
 Buttons, who is on it, might become best mates.

45
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,720
 Yeah, they hang out all the time.

46
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,160
 Avi Loeb is a legit scientist.

47
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,040
 This is a kind of him speculating

48
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,400
 and going to that different kind of place.

49
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,280
 But he's an interesting character.

50
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,640
 - It's interesting because he is,

51
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,880
 this is a proper scientific thing.

52
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,520
 And his alma mater are giving him money for it

53
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,640
 and all that kind of stuff.

54
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,520
 And they're fine with it.

55
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,960
 But every now and then he just keeps going,

56
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,800
 it might be aliens or like, "Oh, for God's sake, Avi.

57
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,160
 Leave it with the aliens thing.

58
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,640
 Let's just talk about the other stuff."

59
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,880
 - It gets attention though, doesn't it?

60
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,200
 As a scientist, all you have to say,

61
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,520
 it's like when we talked about finding like bits of stuff

62
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,120
 in Loch Ness and looking for Nessie.

63
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,440
 The scientists aren't actually looking for Nessie or aliens.

64
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,880
 But if they say they are, that funding's gonna double.

65
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,440
 - I think this guy does believe it though.

66
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,360
 (all laughing)

67
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,000
 I think so, yeah.

68
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,840
 - Can I just tell you one really cute thing

69
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,280
 about empathy in chimps?

70
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,440
 In fact, chimps and bonobos are very similar.

71
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,840
 Bonobos are called the pygmy chimp.

72
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,920
 And Franz de Waal,

73
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,080
 who's another amazing chimp researcher,

74
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,440
 witnessed this and it was a bonobo called Cooney.

75
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,920
 She was in a glass enclosure and a bird crashed into

76
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,800
 the glass walls of her enclosure and fell to the ground.

77
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,360
 And so she went up to this bird

78
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,360
 and she sort of tried to prop it up right

79
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,080
 to try and help it and it fell over again.

80
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,080
 So then she picked it up and she threw it a little bit

81
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,880
 and it fluttered a little bit, still couldn't fly.

82
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,720
 So there's a pause.

83
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,360
 Then she picked it up, climbed to the very top of a tree,

84
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,440
 held onto the very top of this tree with her legs.

85
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,280
 So she's carrying the bird in her hands.

86
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,360
 She spread out the wings of the bird with her hands

87
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,080
 and threw it off the top of the tree.

88
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,480
 - Yeah, it plummeted to it's death.

89
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,180
 - It did plummet to the ground.

90
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,020
 - Oh no.

91
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,520
 - But it was okay, it didn't die.

92
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,840
 - She's sorry till then.

93
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,320
 - So she did it again and again.

94
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,240
 - She actually kept doing it and then she ate it.

95
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,440
 No, then she went down and pray sensibly.

96
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,520
 She thought, okay, not ready to fly yet.

97
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,240
 And then she just guarded it until it was ready to fly again.

98
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,080
 - Oh, okay.

99
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,920
 - That's lovely.

100
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,760
 - Isn't it?

101
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,600
 - That's so nice.

102
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,440
 - And did it eventually fly?

103
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,280
 Do we know?

104
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,440
 - Yeah, it eventually flew straight back

105
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,280
 into the glass wall actually.

106
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,120
 - Amazing.

107
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:37,040
 I read one, 2017, 12 inmates in Alabama escaped a jail

108
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,560
 when they tricked the prison guard to letting them outside

109
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,520
 by smearing peanut butter on a sign above a door

110
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,920
 that read exit so that he couldn't read the word

111
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,380
 and said, "Can we go through there?"

112
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,420
 And he said, "Sure."

113
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,760
 (laughing)

114
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,760
 And I have so many questions about this story

115
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,320
 because how many jails just have a door

116
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,520
 that just leads to a freedom?

117
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,160
 - You need an emergency exit in any building, right?

118
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,000
 - Yeah, I suppose so.

119
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,200
 - Oh God, how do they do that in prisons

120
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,040
 with emergency exits?

121
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,880
 I've never considered that.

122
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,800
 - They must have them.

123
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,640
 - But the whole point of the prison is you can't.

124
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,440
 - But it leads to the courtyard rather than to the--

125
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,280
 - Right, yeah.

126
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,880
 - Maybe to their outside area.

127
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,200
 I mean, I'm just guessing, but.

128
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,040
 - I mean, you get locked in your cell overnight

129
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,680
 so they have to, I don't know how to--

130
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,640
 - Maybe it's a loophole.

131
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,880
 If you're in prison right now and listening,

132
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,000
 find the emergency exit.

133
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,440
 (laughing)

134
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,720
 - There's one door, it's like, yeah, to freedom.

135
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,280
 I think what this probably was was a courtyard

136
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,360
 and then they had plans to scale the walls.

137
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,880
 - Then you would be empty at that time or whatever.

138
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,720
 - Yes, exactly, yeah.

139
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,160
 - But also, yeah, why didn't you notice

140
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,360
 the peanut butter smeared on the sign?

141
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,400
 - How does he not know the schematics of the only door

142
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,920
 that leads to freedom within his own prison?

143
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,760
 - Yeah, it could have been--

144
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,600
 - Often lots of questions.

145
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,840
 - Secunded from another prison.

146
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,000
 - And when it's your first day in the job,

147
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,800
 you're grateful for any advice that you can get

148
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,360
 from your colleagues as the prisoners will be.

149
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,200
 - My colleagues?

150
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,040
 (laughing)

151
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,880
 - That's probably our now.

152
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,200
 - I think of you all as my colleagues.

153
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,440
 (laughing)

154
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,840
 - I messaged you guys yesterday

155
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,560
 because I found out that Tim Allen

156
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,320
 was arrested in Kalamazoo Airport.

157
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,160
 - Oh yeah.

158
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,000
 - Oh yeah.

159
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,560
 - 'Cause we talked about Kalamazoo the other day.

160
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,400
 I just thought it was--

161
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,240
 - In the previous episode, yeah.

162
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,720
 - It was interesting.

163
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,920
 So he was arrested in Kalamazoo for possession of cocaine.

164
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,160
 He provided the names of some other dealers

165
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,800
 and got some time.

166
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,640
 He went to prison,

167
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,160
 but only for three to seven years,

168
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,680
 not for a long amount of time.

169
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,680
 But the interesting thing

170
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,000
 and the reason I'm bringing it up again

171
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,240
 is because his first film that he was in

172
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,520
 was a film called Tropical Snow.

173
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,760
 And it was about people who smuggled cocaine.

174
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,600
 - Oh really?

175
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,440
 - Yeah.

176
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,480
 - Exactly 10 years after he was arrested,

177
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,200
 he was in his first ever film about cocaine smuggling

178
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,560
 and he was arrested for cocaine smuggling.

179
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,600
 - Wow, so he did 10 years ago.

180
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,400
 Did he go, no, no, I'm actually method acting.

181
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,880
 (laughing)

182
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,720
 Did that get him off?

183
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,560
 - Yeah.

184
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,680
 - So he started his acting career quite late.

185
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,840
 Or he was smuggling cocaine aged 10.

186
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,200
 - Yeah, I don't know when he was born.

187
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,640
 So, yeah, I don't know.

188
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,320
 - I wonder if, I read a story about Tim Allen

189
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,680
 and that jail, particularly as well, Kalamazoo jail,

190
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,480
 which is that they did a refurb of the whole jail

191
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,760
 and they got rid of all of the beds.

192
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,240
 But the one bed that they've kept,

193
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,080
 which is a steel bed,

194
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,720
 is the bed that Tim Allen slept in.

195
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,560
 - Is that right?

196
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,680
 - That's the story that I read.

197
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,000
 - That's interesting.

198
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,080
 - What do you mean they've got rid of all the beds?

199
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,080
 - Well, they've replaced the beds.

200
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,720
 - Oh, sir, I think, well, you said they got rid

201
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,560
 of all the beds.

202
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,040
 - But I said refurb.

203
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,040
 Yeah, sorry, so I sort of implied.

204
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,480
 - We're getting something new.

205
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,640
 - It's an upgrade, a bit as more luxurious.

206
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,040
 - It's only one bed now, but it belonged to Tim Allen.

207
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,040
 So let's all hop in.

208
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,480
 - You know, when he talked about crow's nest,

209
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,120
 the first thing I think of is Captain Pugwash,

210
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,560
 just because I associate Tom the Cabin Boy

211
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,280
 was up in the crow's nest and--

212
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,480
 - So that's a cartoon from the 80s?

213
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,880
 - Yeah, well, it was 70s.

214
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,720
 - But I never actually saw the cartoon, but books.

215
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,080
 - And then cartoons.

216
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,640
 - Oh, books then cartoons.

217
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,480
 - I've read the books.

218
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,480
 Oh, maybe the books are written after the cartoons.

219
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,840
 I don't know, I wasn't asked to watch TV.

220
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,160
 - Are these novelizations?

221
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,000
 (laughing)

222
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,120
 I love the Tom and Jerry novels, actually.

223
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,080
 They're very gripping, pacey.

224
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,880
 - Fan fiction, yeah.

225
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,160
 So my mum used to read me the fan fiction.

226
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,320
 So when I got distracted reading about Captain Pugwash

227
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,840
 and I learned something I didn't know,

228
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,320
 which is kind of sad, but quite funny.

229
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,880
 You know the rumors about Pugwash?

230
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,160
 - The Seaman Stains.

231
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,000
 - Seaman Stains, exactly.

232
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,840
 - Larger the Cabin Boy.

233
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,680
 - Yeah.

234
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,440
 - Those were characters and that they--

235
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,800
 - All this stuff that we were told as kids.

236
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,920
 - It was actually filth, yeah.

237
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,760
 - And rude names, yeah.

238
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,280
 - That it was all just a big cover

239
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,880
 and it was a pornographic book.

240
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,880
 And it was very easy to disprove.

241
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,880
 Even as a six-year-old 'cause you were reading the books

242
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,680
 and you were going, "Well, it's called Tom the Cabin Boy."

243
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,280
 And there's no one called Seaman Stains.

244
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,800
 My dad told me these rumors,

245
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,320
 which seems very inappropriate for the age I must have been.

246
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,560
 (laughing)

247
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,520
 - Mid-read as a kid.

248
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,120
 - Yeah, yeah, do you know what--

249
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,960
 - Interesting fact, then.

250
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,680
 - It says she's called Tom the Cabin Boy here.

251
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,840
 But actually, if you watch the play,

252
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,840
 which came before the book, which came before the cartoon.

253
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,520
 - Anyway, these were all rumors

254
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,000
 and they were started by a student newspaper in the 1970s.

255
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,200
 But I was reading an interview with the daughter

256
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,600
 of John Ryan who wrote Pugwash,

257
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,240
 who said her dad was completely dramatized by them.

258
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,080
 - Oh, no.

259
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,280
 - So he was this really innocent, childlike guy, apparently.

260
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,240
 And he, it was seriously upset.

261
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,240
 And she said things like, "Yes, there was a pirate willy,

262
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,480
 "but back at the time, people didn't think like that."

263
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,400
 Back in what time did people not think like that?

264
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,880
 - Was there a pirate willy?

265
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,200
 - There was a pirate willy.

266
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,880
 I bet that's where the students initially got the inspiration.

267
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,800
 - I would kill to have been there the first time

268
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,160
 he was told that someone had made the connection.

269
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,160
 He's going, "Oh, I can't be that bad, can it?"

270
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,320
 - Well, pirate willy is a bit of a,

271
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,880
 "Oh, okay, but it's just pirate willy."

272
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,600
 Well, actually Roger the Cabin Boy

273
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,520
 is also a bit of an implicated name.

274
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,120
 - But there's not a Roger the Cabin Boy.

275
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,960
 It's Tom the Cabin Boy.

276
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,800
 - Oh, right.

277
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,280
 - So they're all fake.

278
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,920
 They're all fake, apart from willy the pirate who's real.

279
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,760
 - Yeah, yeah.

280
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,400
 So the students could have made them up.

281
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,440
 - Didn't realize that.

282
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,280
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

283
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,120
 It's all made up.

284
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,600
 And there's the Pugwash being some kind of rude slang

285
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,440
 for something.

286
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,280
 None of that's true.

287
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,120
 Master Bates didn't exist.

288
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,520
 Master Mates did exist.

289
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,480
 So you can see how they made the leap.

290
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,040
 - They had a cult, didn't they,

291
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,080
 one day when they were doing the show?

292
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,280
 - Yeah.

293
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,520
 - One thing annoys me,

294
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,600
 which is that Listerine gets a lot of shit.

295
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,480
 You know the history of Listerine?

296
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,520
 - It was originally to clean floors.

297
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,760
 - It was to clean floors or wallpaper or whatever, yeah.

298
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,880
 And then people say Listerine made up.

299
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,120
 - Some of them invented, yeah.

300
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,480
 - Invented halitosis.

301
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,480
 - Invented halitosis, yeah.

302
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,320
 - Everyone had amazing breath before that.

303
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,400
 - Yeah, it's like, what?

304
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,720
 The halitosis is rank, bad breath.

305
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,920
 You want to clear it up.

306
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,040
 So yeah, there is this thing.

307
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,800
 And they turned it into kind of a medical problem.

308
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,880
 But halitosis is often caused by bacteria

309
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,800
 and bad bacteria in your mouth.

310
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,920
 So I always feel a bit bad for Listerine

311
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,760
 because they did try to fix bad breath.

312
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,120
 I'm not saying that mouthwash necessarily does.

313
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,320
 And in fact, it can make bad breath worse.

314
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,800
 And particularly mouthwash that contains alcohol.

315
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,640
 - You know, most mouthwash does.

316
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,100
 It contains about 25% alcohol.

317
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,200
 People tend to think, why is that?

318
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,040
 Why would you assume that was?

319
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:54,880
 - Fun.

320
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,600
 (laughing)

321
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,080
 - You can have a good night in.

322
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,120
 - I would say alcohol is antiseptic.

323
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,960
 - Yeah.

324
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,800
 - Bacteria.

325
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,200
 - Yeah, yeah, exactly.

326
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,520
 So you'd need about 60 to 90% concentration of alcohol.

327
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,040
 So you'd need to be drinking very hardcore absinthe

328
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,040
 to have any effect on bacteria.

329
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,880
 - So I should do that every morning, shouldn't I?

330
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,720
 (laughing)

331
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,560
 - It's the right color, right?

332
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,400
 Green absinthe.

333
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,240
 - Yeah, same color.

334
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,080
 - Perfect, yeah.

335
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,880
 Swapping out for some very strong absinthe.

336
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,200
 But yeah, the reason it's there

337
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,520
 is basically sort of as an agent to dissolve other stuff.

338
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,360
 But also 'cause it gives you that burning feeling

339
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,920
 that makes you feel like it's being really effective.

340
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,480
 And so it's actually worse

341
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,720
 'cause alcohol dries your mouth out,

342
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,080
 like stops you salivating as much.

343
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,120
 And that makes a good environment for bacteria.

344
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,160
 - What, a dry mouth?

345
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,040
 - Yeah, weirdly, 'cause they like moisture,

346
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,240
 but your saliva has an acidity level

347
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,160
 which counterbalances what the bacteria want to live in.

348
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,000
 - No, I do.

349
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,840
 - Yeah.

350
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,960
 - We have a mutual buddy

351
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,640
 who I was out for a drink with a while ago.

352
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,800
 And mid-drink, he pulled out a bottle of listerine,

353
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,160
 took a shot of it and just drank it down and put it away.

354
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,640
 - He's having a tough time at the moment.

355
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,000
 (laughing)

356
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,120
 - He said, yeah, you can drink it.

357
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,200
 It's like, he was saying, he was using it for his breath.

358
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,360
 He was using it to just have a nice swig

359
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,040
 and reset his mouth, but--

360
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,200
 - You can't drink it, yeah.

361
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,040
 - Yeah, I didn't know that,

362
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,440
 'cause I've been spitting it out this whole time.

363
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,440
 - You're supposed to spit it out.

364
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,760
 - You're supposed to spit it out.

365
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,200
 You were right to bring it up

366
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,600
 as an unusual thing till it happened.

367
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,360
 - I suppose if you're at the pub,

368
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,960
 most people don't use listerine

369
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,280
 when they're sitting in the pub with their mates.

370
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,120
 If you're around the table,

371
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,160
 you can't just spit on the floor, can you?

372
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,920
 - No, I usually get a shot of listerine

373
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,280
 and put it in some Red Bull.

374
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,520
 (laughing)

375
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,720
 - Do you want to hear something quite off-topic?

376
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,560
 - Sure.

377
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,880
 (laughing)

378
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,000
 - Okay.

379
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,080
 It is about things you have in your mouth.

380
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,360
 - Okay, great.

381
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,400
 - It's pretty on-topic, actually.

382
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,400
 - Yeah, yeah.

383
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,760
 Depends on where you go with it.

384
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,760
 - Some fish are called mouth brooders, right?

385
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,600
 - Oh, yeah.

386
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,960
 - And they bring up their offspring,

387
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,360
 their babies, in their mouths,

388
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,880
 before eventually opening their mouths

389
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,200
 when they're ready to go.

390
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,360
 - So they're kind of safe to grow a little bit in there.

391
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,720
 - Yeah, they're complete, exactly.

392
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,560
 They're safe from predators.

393
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,480
 That's the main thing.

394
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,560
 Some fish, which are mouth brooders,

395
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,080
 deal with the stress of parenthood

396
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,400
 by eating their children.

397
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,480
 (laughing)

398
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,880
 - What, just have a quick swallow?

399
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,720
 - Yeah.

400
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,560
 - Right.

401
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,120
 - Is it when their children are really, really naughty

402
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,080
 or they're sleep deprived,

403
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,680
 are they particularly prone to swallow their kids?

404
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,520
 - It's when the mother,

405
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,640
 'cause in the species it's the mother fish,

406
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,040
 is stressed, she's more prone to swallowing.

407
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,520
 So they've tried playing loud noises at the fish,

408
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,680
 which stresses them out.

409
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,560
 And then she'll swallow a few for children.

410
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,560
 - Oh, God.

411
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,000
 - I bet parents are empathizing

412
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,640
 all over the country as they listen.

413
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,280
 - It might mean that they get,

414
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,080
 well, they get some nutrition for one thing,

415
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,000
 which is helpful,

416
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,920
 but also they might get some antioxidants.

417
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,240
 - Some bloody piece of choir.

418
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,280
 (laughing)

419
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,680
 - The funny thing with extinction is,

420
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:43,840
 is that, you know, it's not suddenly recorded on the spot.

421
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,920
 It takes years to get to that decision where I think,

422
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,760
 you know what, I haven't seen these things for quite a while.

423
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,600
 How long's it been?

424
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,120
 A couple of months, I'll give it another year.

425
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,480
 Let's have another look at it.

426
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,040
 You know, and then 30 years later,

427
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,160
 like, I've got to be honest with you,

428
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,840
 it's been 30 years now.

429
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,680
 We probably,

430
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,000
 should we write it down that they're gone?

431
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,080
 And even then something will spring up.

432
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,040
 Oh no, there they are.

433
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,040
 Gosh, God, we shouldn't have written that down.

434
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,880
 Did you write that down?

435
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,720
 Yeah, it's been,

436
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,880
 it's gone out in all the books.

437
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,200
 Well, I've just seen one.

438
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,800
 So, you know what I mean?

439
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,640
 It's kind of like,

440
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,200
 and that must happen quite often.

441
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,040
 - It's hard to draw the line.

442
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,880
 - Cecilia Kanth.

443
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,240
 That was a long, long time, right?

444
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,080
 How long was that?

445
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,080
 - That was 65 million years, that one,

446
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,920
 which was...

447
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,800
 (laughing)

448
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,520
 - Shall we wait 66 million years?

449
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,080
 - Yes, let's wait 66 million years.

450
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,880
 It's a nice round number.

451
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,720
 And then we'll,

452
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,840
 no, let's do it now.

453
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,040
 - Let's publish the book.

454
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,280
 - He definitely did box out, Dal.

455
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,400
 Let's have a look and see what's did this year.

456
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,240
 What?

457
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,080
 The Cecilia Kanth.

458
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,760
 I saw one this morning.

459
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,920
 No, it's in there.

460
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,760
 It's in there.

461
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,920
 First page.

462
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,760
 That's off.

463
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,000
 I found one this morning.

464
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,240
 All right, give 'em a call.

465
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,920
 (laughing)

466
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,760
 Hello?

467
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,600
 Things are dead.

468
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,440
 Yes, listen, mate.

469
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,880
 Your latest edition.

470
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,880
 The Cecilia Kanth.

471
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,800
 Page one.

472
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,760
 Court one this morning.

473
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,000
 Oh, you're shitting me.

474
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,720
 No, I'm so sorry.

475
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,080
 Did you come around our area?

476
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,880
 No, didn't bother with it.

477
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,240
 (laughing)

478
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,640
 So you never know.

479
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,480
 (laughing)

480
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,880
 That's just what I'm saying.

481
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,600
 (laughing)

482
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,080
 - You're not the first with this series

483
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,200
 to sort of reinvigorate the name of Steve Bonnet.

484
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,760
 2013, he was a character in Assassin's Creed.

485
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,600
 - That's right.

486
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,440
 - Which was, yeah.

487
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,440
 And it was called Black Flag.

488
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,360
 And it was a, yeah, 2013 game

489
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,200
 in which there was a lot of pirates.

490
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,320
 It was the fourth in the Assassin's Creed games.

491
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,280
 And one really interesting detail about it

492
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,680
 is how they promoted this whole game,

493
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,480
 which was they decided,

494
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,840
 like most people would be like,

495
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,280
 "Let's get posters up everywhere

496
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,760
 "or let's do some publicity in bringing a celebrity."

497
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,160
 And they decided to exhume a dead pirate

498
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,080
 from his grave to do DNA tests on him.

499
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:53,160
 Yeah, so the company that makes Assassin's Creed,

500
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,920
 they funded archeologists to go and find a pirate

501
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,760
 who was known as Amaro Pargo.

502
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,440
 This was a big mission where they had to remove

503
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,000
 a giant slab of marble.

504
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,920
 They assumed that they knew where he was buried

505
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,360
 and they were correct in the end.

506
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,440
 And they found this whole booty

507
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,040
 of other dead people as well.

508
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,960
 Like it wasn't just him.

509
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,160
 It was like his nieces and nephews.

510
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,880
 - Why are they doing this?

511
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,640
 - Can I just say, I don't know if that's the right term,

512
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,320
 a booty of dead people.

513
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,200
 (laughing)

514
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,080
 What's in your booty?

515
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,080
 Dead people.

516
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:26,080
 - That just sounds a bit piratey, I guess.

517
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,480
 - But yeah, so they managed to find him.

518
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,840
 They found all these details about him.

519
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,040
 He was about five foot, four inches tall.

520
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:36,440
 Yeah, he was quite a robust character.

521
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,840
 - And then what purpose did they serve

522
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,120
 except for like giving the makers nightmares?

523
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,360
 Did they then base the character in Assassin's Creed

524
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,440
 completely on this weird corpse that they'd found?

525
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,000
 - What's weird is I don't think

526
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,040
 he's in the game.

527
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:52,400
 - No, 'cause you said it's just Steve in the game.

528
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,240
 It's just weird.

529
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,080
 - No, no, no, it's not Steve.

530
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,600
 Steve's a character in the game.

531
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,600
 There's lots of pirates

532
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,040
 and there's lots of historical pirates.

533
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,720
 And it was while they were doing the development,

534
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,320
 they were researching the game

535
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,800
 and they found this guy and they thought,

536
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,160
 God, he's such an interesting character.

537
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,480
 Why is he unknown?

538
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,240
 And so they then got in touch

539
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,840
 with this company of archeologists

540
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,840
 and they said, would you dig him up for us?

541
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,760
 I think they had plans probably to do that anyway.

542
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,920
 - And they just wanted publicity.

543
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,760
 - Yeah, they wanted publicity.

544
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,880
 - They wanted people to talk about it on podcasts

545
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,720
 10 years later.

546
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,560
 - Exactly.

547
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,720
 - You've fallen right into the trap

548
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,760
 of this weird modern day Birkenhair freak.

549
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,600
 - Do we keep doing this?

550
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,360
 This will be a conversation piece, Trump.

551
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,440
 We've got to keep doing this.

552
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,280
 This will come up.

553
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,120
 This will pop up.

554
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,960
 There'll be something.

555
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,080
 Someone will talk about it.

556
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,920
 - I don't know.

557
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,920
 It feels weird.

558
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,720
 You get banana split eating contests.

559
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,560
 - Oh yeah.

560
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,000
 - Which I found underwhelming, if I'm honest.

561
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,880
 And I thought maybe we could enter one.

562
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,720
 - Okay.

563
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,560
 - Okay.

564
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,400
 - Great.

565
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,040
 - You know, there's surveys where they ask a load of men

566
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,400
 if they can beat Serena Williams in a tennis match.

567
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,240
 - Oh yeah.

568
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,080
 - And they all say they can.

569
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,480
 I think this is the Anna equivalent of it.

570
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,760
 It's like, I could beat anyone in an eating contest.

571
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,040
 - An eating contest I see.

572
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,160
 - You think we could win a banana split contest?

573
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,680
 - Well, listen to this.

574
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,560
 I was reading about the one that's held in Maryland

575
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,680
 and it's an annual Jimmy Cone banana split eating contest.

576
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,280
 And I was reading the report for the 2015 one.

577
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,560
 I don't know how much people have improved since then.

578
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:17,120
 But in the kids contest, it was won fittingly

579
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,120
 by someone called Tommy Aites.

580
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:19,960
 - Oh, brilliant.

581
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:23,160
 - And he was 12 and he had 20 minutes

582
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,520
 and he got through 2.5 banana splits.

583
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,120
 - I think that if he was 12, this could be a kids thing.

584
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,720
 - No, there is an adult round.

585
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,560
 - Is there?

586
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,880
 - I've kind of deep-raised this.

587
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,720
 But the adult round.

588
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,360
 - I've got to see Anna Hodlin into this kids contest.

589
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,680
 I can bite the floor with a lot of you.

590
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,560
 - I intend to try and enter the kids one first.

591
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,280
 - Obviously, I'll wear some armbands or something.

592
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:50,400
 The adult one, I think the winner got through

593
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,720
 four banana splits in half an hour.

594
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,560
 - Half an hour?

595
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,400
 - I believe it was.

596
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,000
 Isn't that so crap?

597
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,600
 - That's four bananas and 12 scoops of ice cream.

598
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,440
 - Yeah.

599
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,280
 - In half an hour.

600
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,120
 - In half an hour, yeah.

601
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,360
 But no, I'm not saying it's a timing.

602
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,440
 I'm saying it's a capacity thing.

603
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,280
 That's a lot of...

604
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,440
 - It certainly is capacity.

605
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,600
 They say the best way to do it is to do it slowly

606
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,680
 because everyone's vomiting.

607
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,360
 In fact, Tommy, sweetly Tommy eights when he won,

608
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,280
 he was interviewed and they were like,

609
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,440
 "How was that, Tommy?"

610
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,960
 And he said, "It was awesome."

611
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,600
 And then immediately vomited into the bucket

612
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,920
 that was provided.

613
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,760
 - Disqualified.

614
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,960
 - You know moon rock.

615
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,800
 - Yeah, man.

616
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,720
 - Yeah, it's from the moon.

617
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,760
 - Rock from the moon.

618
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,040
 So the Apollo 11 astronauts got a load of rocks down

619
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,560
 when they came back from the moon.

620
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,960
 And 7.5% of that rock was fed to animals.

621
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,800
 - No!

622
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,920
 - Yeah, 'cause they wanted to know what would happen

623
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,280
 if you gave it to animals.

624
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,400
 Would it, is it carcinogenic?

625
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,400
 Would it make them sick?

626
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,600
 All these different things.

627
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,160
 So there was a woman called Marion Brooks

628
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,760
 who worked at the University of St. Paul

629
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,320
 and she was given all this stuff

630
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,360
 and she gave it to oysters, shrimps, cockroaches, flies,

631
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,520
 moths, fish, and just kept giving little bits.

632
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,360
 And some of them were giving it to eat.

633
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,280
 Some of them were inoculated with it.

634
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,240
 Some of them were just allowed to crawl around it

635
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,880
 and they wanted to see if they would die.

636
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,040
 - That is incredible.

637
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:06,880
 - Isn't that cool?

638
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,200
 - And what happened?

639
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,440
 - They were all fine 'cause it's just rock.

640
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,800
 But some of the fish died.

641
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,000
 But that's because someone dropped a bottle of sodium

642
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,680
 hydrochloride next to where they lived

643
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,360
 and so they died of the fumes.

644
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,160
 And a couple of oysters died

645
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,600
 because they pooed in their own water and they died.

646
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,720
 But none of them died because of the rocks.

647
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,960
 - I was gonna bid very recently

648
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,400
 on a couple of cockroaches that were up for auction

649
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,000
 that the moon dust was still inside.

650
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,840
 - Oh wow.

651
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,680
 - So you were getting the moon dust.

652
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,960
 - Your children would have loved that.

653
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,080
 - They would have loved it.

654
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,040
 Unfortunately, NASA took it off the bidding

655
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:46,880
 because they decided--

656
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,720
 - 'Cause you're not allowed to sell that.

657
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,560
 - You're not allowed to sell that, exactly.

658
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,680
 - Even if they're inside a cockroach.

659
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,520
 - Even if they're inside a cockroach.

660
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,360
 - Really?

661
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,200
 - Even if they ground up dust in there.

662
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,040
 - The cockroach is dead, right?

663
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,200
 - Yeah, it's dead.

664
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,760
 So this was back in the '60s, but they kept the cockroaches

665
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,240
 and they had the moon dust still inside them.

666
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,800
 - What kind of price would you have paid?

667
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,240
 - Oh, you know, that was going for a good mill, I think.

668
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,080
 So I would have been one of those just, you know,

669
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,400
 token early voters.

670
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,320
 - A lower bid, but with a lovely letter attached to it.

671
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,360
 Saying this would really mean a lot to me.

672
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,200
 - Yes, exactly.

673
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,560
 - 'Cause sometimes auctioneers do take,

674
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,880
 they look kindly on that, you know?

675
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,280
 - Yeah, so I've got a bit of Berlin Wall

676
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,080
 that would look nice next to that in the house.

677
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,160
 - Wow, that's cool.

678
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:25,640
 - Yeah, NASA are so pedantic, in my experience.

679
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,480
 (laughing)

680
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,320
 - Psycho.

681
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,400
 - Psycho.

682
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,360
 - Yes, because you know that I have spoken

683
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,600
 to a national on the International Space Station.

684
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,440
 - Oh, who was that?

685
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,280
 - I know this, yeah.

686
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,640
 - Yeah, she's a fan of my dad, Brett Aporno,

687
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,040
 and NASA astronauts are allowed a mental health call

688
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,960
 every few weeks when they're up there.

689
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,360
 She chose to speak to me.

690
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,320
 - You.

691
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,040
 - Honestly, she could have chosen anyone.

692
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,080
 - That would surely trigger a bigger intervention

693
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,480
 from the mental health team.

694
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,320
 (laughing)

695
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,160
 - Exactly, yeah.

696
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,000
 - I'll speak to this guy.

697
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,760
 (laughing)

698
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,600
 - But I was like--

699
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,960
 - Restrain her, restrain her now, put her in the brig.

700
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,320
 - That was like NASA.

701
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,760
 They're gonna have the most amazing like communication

702
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,360
 and software, Microsoft Teams.

703
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,640
 (laughing)

704
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,400
 Is what I used to speak to space.

705
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,240
 - Amazing.

706
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,080
 - Yeah, insane.

707
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,400
 And they were very, they were like,

708
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,360
 you can't take any pictures,

709
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,160
 you can't even do a screen grab.

710
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,000
 - Wow.

711
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,760
 - NASA was just so annoying.

712
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,680
 - How did they know you hadn't done a screen grab?

713
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,520
 - Well, this is the thing.

714
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,040
 I was so paranoid that my whole computer's bugged.

715
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,880
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

716
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,520
 - To my wifi connection, and so I didn't dare do one.

717
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,360
 But so--

718
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,200
 - Wow.

719
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,480
 - Although I think I do have a photo of us.

720
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,320
 - What did you talk about?

721
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,160
 Was it her?

722
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,560
 Who was asking who questions?

723
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,080
 - Well, I think it was supposed to be her

724
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,560
 asking us questions, but we just asked her

725
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,960
 a million questions about being in space.

726
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,760
 And she gave us a tour of the whole station.

727
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,760
 It was incredible.

728
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,680
 Showed us Earth from like the windows.

729
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,520
 - That's so cool.

730
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,360
 What was her name?

731
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,520
 - I'm not sure if I can say the name,

732
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,360
 just in case--

733
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,200
 - Oh, really?

734
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,200
 - Natter do get in, you know.

735
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,500
 - If any astronauts are listening

736
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,120
 and want to talk about rocks, Andy, you're--

737
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,480
 - Oh my God, I'm so free.

738
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,800
 (laughing)

739
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,640
 - Yeah.

740
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,200
 - Apparently they listened to a lot of podcasts up there.

741
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,040
 So--

742
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,860
 - Oh, okay, right.

743
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,320
 - Edward Aporno.

744
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,160
 - Right.

745
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,320
 - It wasn't this, but, you know.

746
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,200
 (laughing)

747
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,120
 - I've got one more fact about tiny dust.

748
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,120
 - Gosh, please.

749
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,240
 - This is a really cool idea.

750
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,840
 It's the idea that you can use crushed rocks

751
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,960
 to fight climate change.

752
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,600
 I think it's best to come across this.

753
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,040
 So, basalt is a rock that's volcanic.

754
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,720
 And when rain falls, so this is the problem.

755
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,400
 Rain falls, it combines with carbon dioxide in the air,

756
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,120
 becomes slightly acidic, right?

757
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,680
 And the problem is obviously too much carbon dioxide

758
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,280
 in the air, that's the main cause of climate change.

759
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,280
 If that acidic rain hits particular rock types,

760
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,800
 it can cause a chemical reaction which kind of locks up

761
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,100
 the carbon dioxide, removes it from the atmosphere,

762
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,300
 which is a good thing.

763
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,420
 And if you spread basalt dust across a field,

764
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,940
 just an ordinary field, you massively increase

765
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,420
 the surface area, that reaction will happen,

766
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,860
 like a hundred fold or more than that.

767
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,980
 And that's the plan.

768
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,540
 That carbon is captured, it washes down rivers,

769
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,580
 animals like oysters might put it in their shells.

770
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,580
 When they die, the shells fall to the bottom of the ocean.

771
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:58,220
 That carbon is just sequestered indefinitely.

772
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,060
 - Oh, that's a problem.

773
00:22:59,060 --> 00:22:59,900
 - Yeah, that's the problem.

774
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:00,740
 - So that's the idea.

775
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,240
 It's still in the research stage at the moment,

776
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,840
 but it is, you know, that's a dream,

777
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,200
 that it will be one of the methods

778
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,000
 we could use to fight climate change.

779
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,760
 It would use only 0.2% of UK electricity generation.

780
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,520
 - You won't be able to grow stuff on those fields, right?

781
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,360
 - I think you still can.

782
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,200
 I think that's the point.

783
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,640
 Yeah, yeah, it's just a very fine layer of dust.

784
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,280
 In fact, it even increases crop yields in some cases.

785
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,520
 - You could put it on golf courses,

786
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,360
 couldn't you?

787
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,200
 That might work.

788
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,040
 - Yeah, yeah.

789
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,880
 - It's a green space.

790
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,720
 - Yeah, exactly, yeah.

791
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,540
 - That's really good.

792
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,380
 - Yeah, that's the plan.

793
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,220
 - So good news.

794
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:28,220
 - We can all get planes again.

795
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:31,060
 (all laughing)

796
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,220
 - But the Muppet Show is sort of for adults

797
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,400
 and for children, as in the original TV series,

798
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,080
 as you know, and lots of the Muppets

799
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,300
 have quite serious problems in their lives.

800
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:41,500
 Gonzo is depressive, and Kermit is incredibly stressed,

801
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,060
 and there's all sorts of stuff going on.

802
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,340
 - That's not homeless.

803
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,180
 - Oh, well, he's Sesame Street,

804
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,020
 so he's different universe, but uh...

805
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,460
 - 'Cause Sesame Street is for kids, right?

806
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:52,380
 - Count on Count has erythomomania,

807
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,540
 which is a mental illness

808
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,500
 where you have a clouding obsession

809
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,100
 with numbers and mathematical processes,

810
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,220
 which interferes with your everyday life.

811
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,140
 - That's...

812
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,380
 Wait, hang on.

813
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,700
 - There, hang on.

814
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,540
 - You don't know about it, Andy.

815
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,860
 - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

816
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:10,340
 - I remember thinking 257,000 minutes ago.

817
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,780
 (all laughing)

818
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,700
 - But there's a thing about vampires.

819
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,680
 There's a myth about vampires,

820
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,820
 that if you throw grains of rice on the ground,

821
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,180
 then they'll have to be obsessed with it.

822
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,140
 So is that where the counting thing from?

823
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:20,980
 - Well, we don't know for sure,

824
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:23,580
 but it seems likely that that's where that comes from.

825
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,500
 But yeah, obviously the erythomomania

826
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,020
 is not necessarily that he suffers from that.

827
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,620
 - Or is it 'cause he's called the Count?

828
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,460
 - Yeah, it could be that.

829
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,020
 - It's just, I think it's kind of worth it.

830
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,580
 (all laughing)

831
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,340
 - There was a complaint by a guy called Joseph B. Regoli

832
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:41,300
 in 1979 that the Count von Counts

833
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:44,100
 might mislead children into trusting Dracula

834
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,300
 and possibly monsters in general.

835
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,460
 - Because he was such a nice character.

836
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:51,180
 - And everyone loved him, but actually he was a bad guy.

837
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:55,620
 And maybe kids need to learn to not trust the bad guys.

838
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,860
 - Not trust Dracula when he's not on your door.

839
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,380
 Don't invite him in.

840
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,100
 Keep the garlic safe.

841
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,620
 - And the Sesame Street people replied saying

842
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,100
 that we've tried to make it clear

843
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,740
 that the Count is not a representative of evil.

844
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,340
 (all laughing)

845
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,180
 - God.

846
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:16,020
 - Just on why things floating and things sinking.

847
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:16,860
 - Yeah.

848
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,420
 - There's been some new research done recently

849
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:22,060
 into why some poo's float and some poo's sink.

850
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:22,900
 - Okay.

851
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:23,740
 - This is really exciting.

852
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,580
 - This is very exciting.

853
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,420
 - This is useful.

854
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,660
 - So I think it's about 10 to 15% of people

855
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,180
 that poo's always float.

856
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,820
 And almost everyone else that poo's always sink.

857
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,660
 So.

858
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,900
 - Hang on, sorry, but most of us have

859
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,660
 sometimes float, sometimes sink, right?

860
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,860
 - Yeah.

861
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,820
 But people have 10, people tend one way or the other.

862
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:39,660
 - Okay, got it.

863
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:41,540
 - Like some people, it's universal one way or the other.

864
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,820
 And it's 10 to 15, it's sort of always,

865
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:44,660
 they're always floating.

866
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:48,100
 So, I know, and it's to do with,

867
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,260
 you're not going to be staggered,

868
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,500
 the gas content of the actual poo.

869
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,580
 But there was a theory it was to do with fat content,

870
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,220
 as in because the fat cells in the mud.

871
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,380
 - Yeah, exactly, yeah.

872
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:00,980
 And so the initial experiment was done by a scientist

873
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,660
 called Michael Levitt and William Dwayne,

874
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,940
 and this was in 1972.

875
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,020
 And they were the ones who first showed

876
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,180
 it was to do with gas.

877
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,100
 I just loved this.

878
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,260
 One of them said to the other,

879
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,500
 my poo's always float.

880
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,860
 And, oh, that's interesting, I wonder why.

881
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,740
 And so they collected floaters

882
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,220
 from 13 experimental subjects.

883
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,060
 - Right.

884
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:21,060
 - I had no idea how they opened those conversations.

885
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:24,060
 And they increased the pressurization on the poo's

886
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,060
 to remove the gas, and then they all sank.

887
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,740
 And irrespective of the fat content.

888
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,980
 So that's how they proved that.

889
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:32,420
 The new research is from Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.

890
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:36,180
 And it's a scientist called Nagarajan Kanan and colleagues

891
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:39,980
 who bred some mice with no gut bacteria.

892
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:42,980
 And it means they always produce sinkers.

893
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,820
 - Okay.

894
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:44,940
 - It's gas from the gut microbes.

895
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:45,780
 - Gas, how interesting.

896
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,100
 - Yeah, it's normal mice, it's 50/50.

897
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,660
 But these special GM--

898
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:51,460
 - So if you're one of the 14%,

899
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:54,020
 if you were to eat some yakult for a few days,

900
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,740
 do you think your poo's would stop?

901
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,060
 - I don't think that research has been done.

902
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:00,980
 I think that's a great next journey for this experiment.

903
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,100
 - The yakult actually increases good bacteria.

904
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,260
 So I would have thought that makes it float.

905
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,900
 - Well, it changes your microbiome, doesn't it?

906
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,780
 - Changes, I wonder.

907
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:10,140
 - What does it mean for Anna then, though, who's poo's?

908
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,620
 (all laughing)

909
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,460
 I would think Anna's.

910
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:16,420
 - Anna's are shroding as poo's.

911
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,660
 And you don't know whether they'll sink or float

912
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,500
 until they're out.

913
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,260
 - It's sort of both at the same time.

914
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,060
 (all laughing)

915
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,420
 - It's sort of listing.

916
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:28,980
 - Yeah, you actually put armbands on them sometimes.

917
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,700
 Get them back up to the surface.

918
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,740
 - There's an episode where Fred is playing Scrabble.

919
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,700
 And he's just trying to save face

920
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,020
 'cause he doesn't know many words.

921
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,780
 And so he makes up a word

922
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,300
 to try and get some extra points.

923
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,300
 And the word that they thought was made up,

924
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,660
 which possibly was at the time--

925
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,500
 - Brexit.

926
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,780
 (all laughing)

927
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,020
 - Was zarf.

928
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,100
 - Oh, no way.

929
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,020
 Oh my God.

930
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:55,260
 - Zarf is an exciting word that I introduced

931
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:58,060
 to our listeners and the fellow fishers.

932
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,100
 A while ago, zarf is, do you know what it is?

933
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,260
 - Yes, what?

934
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,740
 - I love that episode.

935
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:05,420
 (all laughing)

936
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,740
 - God, what a chance.

937
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,300
 - We probably don't need to go over it again.

938
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,820
 - No, no, no, no, what was it?

939
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,700
 - You know, when you go into a coffee shop

940
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,660
 and you get a coffee and it's a bit too hot,

941
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,460
 and they give you that little cardboard sleeve

942
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,060
 that goes under it, that's a zarf.

943
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:18,900
 - No.

944
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,740
 - Yes.

945
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,620
 So maybe the person who came up with the name of the zarf

946
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,020
 had seen this episode of the Flintstones.

947
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,540
 - And went, ooh, there's a word going for spare.

948
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,380
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

949
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,340
 - I think the word zarf did exist before then

950
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,020
 'cause I've since looked it up.

951
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:33,820
 And a zarf in places like Russia and Turkey and stuff,

952
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:36,420
 you have like a glass cup for coffee.

953
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,860
 And then they have like a metal holder

954
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,860
 that the glass goes in and that's known as a zarf.

955
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,700
 - You're kidding.

956
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,540
 - Oh my God.

957
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,580
 - So it's a proper thing and then they use the word

958
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,620
 to refer to the cardboard.

959
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,460
 - That's what I've got.

960
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,300
 That's really interesting.

961
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,140
 - That's really cool.

962
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,140
 - That's, yeah.

963
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:53,020
 - Well, one of the videos I saw sort of screws up

964
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:55,820
 because the tram has to go at quite a pace

965
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,540
 to hit the inflatable ball.

966
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,860
 And then the idea is that the ball rolls

967
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,620
 into these giant inflatable skittles and knocks them down.

968
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,620
 But the tram does struggle to slow down.

969
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:06,220
 So what you see is a ball knocking into the skittles

970
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,420
 and then immediately afterwards,

971
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,540
 the tram mowing down all of the skittles.

972
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,380
 - Oh, that's no point.

973
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,220
 That's no point.

974
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,060
 - That's no point.

975
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:12,900
 - Just to break the forehand.

976
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,740
 - As in bowling.

977
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:16,980
 - I thought it looked, I think it looked good too.

978
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:20,380
 - Wait, you're not allowed to chase your ball down the...

979
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,900
 - Shit.

980
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,460
 - I'm always getting lifted up by those claws at the end.

981
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,720
 (laughing)

982
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,820
 - Just rolling back up there.

983
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:33,060
 (laughing)

984
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:36,060
 - Popping out, someone puts his hand in your face.

985
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,740
 - Two up the nose, one in the mouth.

986
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,980
 (laughing)

987
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:39,820
 Really to the go.

988
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,900
 I'm a large size.

989
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,480
 (upbeat music)

990
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,060
 (upbeat music)

991
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:48,640
 (upbeat music)

992
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,220
 (upbeat music)

993
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,800
 (upbeat music)

994
00:29:53,800 --> 00:30:03,800
