WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.440
 - Speaking of things under the water, as we were,

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.720
 and also kind of about space,

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.760
 there is a guy called Avi Loeb

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.080
 from the Harvard Smithsonian Center of Astrophysics,

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.560
 and he's currently looking under the water for some aliens.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.400
 - So excited.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.920
 - I knew that Dan would like this.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.000
 So basically, do you remember there was this rock

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.320
 that came from outside the solar system

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.160
 when it was coming through?

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.560
 It's like a long cigar-shaped rock,

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.440
 and people thought it might have been an alien.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.520
 I think it's called Uma Mora or something.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.720
 - Uma Mora, yeah. - Yeah, something like that.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.080
 Anyway, there's been another one,

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.440
 there was another previous one,

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.920
 and it was coming probably from outside the solar system,

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.360
 was going really, really fast,

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.040
 and it actually crashed into the Earth's atmosphere

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.280
 and went underwater.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.400
 And this guy, Avi Loeb, wants to go and find it,

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.560
 ostensibly so he can study it

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.480
 and see kind of what rocks it is

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.800
 and what makes it up.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.840
 But then he also says it could be a technological object

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.200
 created by aliens.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.160
 - He believes it might be a beacon

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.920
 so that it's some sort of boop, boop, boop, boop.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.520
 - That's how the second one arrived.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.360
 - There you go.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.240
 - The second one was following the beacon of the first one.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.080
 - Oh, yeah.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.920
 - Saw the state of Earth.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.200
 I thought, "Oh, I'm actually just gonna pretend

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.040
 to be a rock."

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.520
 (all laughing)

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.560
 - He's actually so cool.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.800
 - He's planning to go and find it.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.080
 He's got a ship lined up.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.800
 And one of the people who might be going on this trip is--

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.560
 - Dan Shriver.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.720
 - I do a second podcast called The Cryptid Factor.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.640
 Buttons, who is on it, might become best mates.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.720
 Yeah, they hang out all the time.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.160
 Avi Loeb is a legit scientist.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.040
 This is a kind of him speculating

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.400
 and going to that different kind of place.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.280
 But he's an interesting character.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.640
 - It's interesting because he is,

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.880
 this is a proper scientific thing.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.520
 And his alma mater are giving him money for it

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.640
 and all that kind of stuff.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.520
 And they're fine with it.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.960
 But every now and then he just keeps going,

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.800
 it might be aliens or like, "Oh, for God's sake, Avi.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.160
 Leave it with the aliens thing.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.640
 Let's just talk about the other stuff."

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.880
 - It gets attention though, doesn't it?

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.200
 As a scientist, all you have to say,

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.520
 it's like when we talked about finding like bits of stuff

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.120
 in Loch Ness and looking for Nessie.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.440
 The scientists aren't actually looking for Nessie or aliens.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.880
 But if they say they are, that funding's gonna double.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.440
 - I think this guy does believe it though.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.360
 (all laughing)

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.000
 I think so, yeah.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.840
 - Can I just tell you one really cute thing

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.280
 about empathy in chimps?

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.440
 In fact, chimps and bonobos are very similar.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.840
 Bonobos are called the pygmy chimp.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.920
 And Franz de Waal,

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.080
 who's another amazing chimp researcher,

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.440
 witnessed this and it was a bonobo called Cooney.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.920
 She was in a glass enclosure and a bird crashed into

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.800
 the glass walls of her enclosure and fell to the ground.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.360
 And so she went up to this bird

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.360
 and she sort of tried to prop it up right

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.080
 to try and help it and it fell over again.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.080
 So then she picked it up and she threw it a little bit

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.880
 and it fluttered a little bit, still couldn't fly.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.720
 So there's a pause.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.360
 Then she picked it up, climbed to the very top of a tree,

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.440
 held onto the very top of this tree with her legs.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.280
 So she's carrying the bird in her hands.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.360
 She spread out the wings of the bird with her hands

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.080
 and threw it off the top of the tree.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.480
 - Yeah, it plummeted to it's death.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.180
 - It did plummet to the ground.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.020
 - Oh no.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.520
 - But it was okay, it didn't die.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.840
 - She's sorry till then.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.320
 - So she did it again and again.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.240
 - She actually kept doing it and then she ate it.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.440
 No, then she went down and pray sensibly.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.520
 She thought, okay, not ready to fly yet.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.240
 And then she just guarded it until it was ready to fly again.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.080
 - Oh, okay.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.920
 - That's lovely.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:24.760
 - Isn't it?

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.600
 - That's so nice.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.440
 - And did it eventually fly?

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.280
 Do we know?

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.440
 - Yeah, it eventually flew straight back

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.280
 into the glass wall actually.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.120
 - Amazing.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.040
 I read one, 2017, 12 inmates in Alabama escaped a jail

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.560
 when they tricked the prison guard to letting them outside

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.520
 by smearing peanut butter on a sign above a door

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.920
 that read exit so that he couldn't read the word

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.380
 and said, "Can we go through there?"

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.420
 And he said, "Sure."

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.760
 (laughing)

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.760
 And I have so many questions about this story

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.320
 because how many jails just have a door

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.520
 that just leads to a freedom?

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.160
 - You need an emergency exit in any building, right?

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.000
 - Yeah, I suppose so.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.200
 - Oh God, how do they do that in prisons

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.040
 with emergency exits?

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.880
 I've never considered that.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:06.800
 - They must have them.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.640
 - But the whole point of the prison is you can't.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.440
 - But it leads to the courtyard rather than to the--

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.280
 - Right, yeah.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.880
 - Maybe to their outside area.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.200
 I mean, I'm just guessing, but.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.040
 - I mean, you get locked in your cell overnight

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.680
 so they have to, I don't know how to--

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.640
 - Maybe it's a loophole.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.880
 If you're in prison right now and listening,

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.000
 find the emergency exit.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.440
 (laughing)

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.720
 - There's one door, it's like, yeah, to freedom.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.280
 I think what this probably was was a courtyard

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.360
 and then they had plans to scale the walls.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.880
 - Then you would be empty at that time or whatever.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:33.720
 - Yes, exactly, yeah.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.160
 - But also, yeah, why didn't you notice

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.360
 the peanut butter smeared on the sign?

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.400
 - How does he not know the schematics of the only door

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.920
 that leads to freedom within his own prison?

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.760
 - Yeah, it could have been--

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:43.600
 - Often lots of questions.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.840
 - Secunded from another prison.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.000
 - And when it's your first day in the job,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.800
 you're grateful for any advice that you can get

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.360
 from your colleagues as the prisoners will be.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.200
 - My colleagues?

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.040
 (laughing)

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.880
 - That's probably our now.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.200
 - I think of you all as my colleagues.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.440
 (laughing)

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.840
 - I messaged you guys yesterday

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.560
 because I found out that Tim Allen

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.320
 was arrested in Kalamazoo Airport.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.160
 - Oh yeah.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.000
 - Oh yeah.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.560
 - 'Cause we talked about Kalamazoo the other day.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.400
 I just thought it was--

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.240
 - In the previous episode, yeah.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.720
 - It was interesting.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.920
 So he was arrested in Kalamazoo for possession of cocaine.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.160
 He provided the names of some other dealers

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.800
 and got some time.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.640
 He went to prison,

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.160
 but only for three to seven years,

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.680
 not for a long amount of time.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.680
 But the interesting thing

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.000
 and the reason I'm bringing it up again

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.240
 is because his first film that he was in

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.520
 was a film called Tropical Snow.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.760
 And it was about people who smuggled cocaine.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.600
 - Oh really?

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.440
 - Yeah.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.480
 - Exactly 10 years after he was arrested,

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.200
 he was in his first ever film about cocaine smuggling

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.560
 and he was arrested for cocaine smuggling.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.600
 - Wow, so he did 10 years ago.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.400
 Did he go, no, no, I'm actually method acting.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.880
 (laughing)

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:44.720
 Did that get him off?

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.560
 - Yeah.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.680
 - So he started his acting career quite late.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.840
 Or he was smuggling cocaine aged 10.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.200
 - Yeah, I don't know when he was born.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.640
 So, yeah, I don't know.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.320
 - I wonder if, I read a story about Tim Allen

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.680
 and that jail, particularly as well, Kalamazoo jail,

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.480
 which is that they did a refurb of the whole jail

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.760
 and they got rid of all of the beds.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.240
 But the one bed that they've kept,

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.080
 which is a steel bed,

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.720
 is the bed that Tim Allen slept in.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.560
 - Is that right?

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.680
 - That's the story that I read.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.000
 - That's interesting.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.080
 - What do you mean they've got rid of all the beds?

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.080
 - Well, they've replaced the beds.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.720
 - Oh, sir, I think, well, you said they got rid

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.560
 of all the beds.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.040
 - But I said refurb.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.040
 Yeah, sorry, so I sort of implied.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.480
 - We're getting something new.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.640
 - It's an upgrade, a bit as more luxurious.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.040
 - It's only one bed now, but it belonged to Tim Allen.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.040
 So let's all hop in.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.480
 - You know, when he talked about crow's nest,

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.120
 the first thing I think of is Captain Pugwash,

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.560
 just because I associate Tom the Cabin Boy

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.280
 was up in the crow's nest and--

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.480
 - So that's a cartoon from the 80s?

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.880
 - Yeah, well, it was 70s.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.720
 - But I never actually saw the cartoon, but books.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.080
 - And then cartoons.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.640
 - Oh, books then cartoons.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:45.480
 - I've read the books.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.480
 Oh, maybe the books are written after the cartoons.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.840
 I don't know, I wasn't asked to watch TV.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.160
 - Are these novelizations?

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.000
 (laughing)

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.120
 I love the Tom and Jerry novels, actually.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.080
 They're very gripping, pacey.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.880
 - Fan fiction, yeah.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.160
 So my mum used to read me the fan fiction.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.320
 So when I got distracted reading about Captain Pugwash

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.840
 and I learned something I didn't know,

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.320
 which is kind of sad, but quite funny.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.880
 You know the rumors about Pugwash?

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.160
 - The Seaman Stains.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.000
 - Seaman Stains, exactly.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:11.840
 - Larger the Cabin Boy.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:12.680
 - Yeah.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.440
 - Those were characters and that they--

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.800
 - All this stuff that we were told as kids.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:16.920
 - It was actually filth, yeah.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:17.760
 - And rude names, yeah.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.280
 - That it was all just a big cover

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.880
 and it was a pornographic book.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.880
 And it was very easy to disprove.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.880
 Even as a six-year-old 'cause you were reading the books

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.680
 and you were going, "Well, it's called Tom the Cabin Boy."

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.280
 And there's no one called Seaman Stains.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.800
 My dad told me these rumors,

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.320
 which seems very inappropriate for the age I must have been.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.560
 (laughing)

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.520
 - Mid-read as a kid.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.120
 - Yeah, yeah, do you know what--

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.960
 - Interesting fact, then.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.680
 - It says she's called Tom the Cabin Boy here.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.840
 But actually, if you watch the play,

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.840
 which came before the book, which came before the cartoon.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.520
 - Anyway, these were all rumors

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.000
 and they were started by a student newspaper in the 1970s.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.200
 But I was reading an interview with the daughter

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.600
 of John Ryan who wrote Pugwash,

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.240
 who said her dad was completely dramatized by them.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.080
 - Oh, no.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.280
 - So he was this really innocent, childlike guy, apparently.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.240
 And he, it was seriously upset.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:11.240
 And she said things like, "Yes, there was a pirate willy,

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:16.480
 "but back at the time, people didn't think like that."

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.400
 Back in what time did people not think like that?

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:19.880
 - Was there a pirate willy?

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.200
 - There was a pirate willy.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.880
 I bet that's where the students initially got the inspiration.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.800
 - I would kill to have been there the first time

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.160
 he was told that someone had made the connection.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.160
 He's going, "Oh, I can't be that bad, can it?"

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.320
 - Well, pirate willy is a bit of a,

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.880
 "Oh, okay, but it's just pirate willy."

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.600
 Well, actually Roger the Cabin Boy

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.520
 is also a bit of an implicated name.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.120
 - But there's not a Roger the Cabin Boy.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:39.960
 It's Tom the Cabin Boy.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:40.800
 - Oh, right.

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.280
 - So they're all fake.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.920
 They're all fake, apart from willy the pirate who's real.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:46.760
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.400
 So the students could have made them up.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.440
 - Didn't realize that.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.280
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.120
 It's all made up.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.600
 And there's the Pugwash being some kind of rude slang

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.440
 for something.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:55.280
 None of that's true.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.120
 Master Bates didn't exist.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.520
 Master Mates did exist.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.480
 So you can see how they made the leap.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.040
 - They had a cult, didn't they,

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.080
 one day when they were doing the show?

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.280
 - Yeah.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.520
 - One thing annoys me,

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.600
 which is that Listerine gets a lot of shit.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.480
 You know the history of Listerine?

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.520
 - It was originally to clean floors.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.760
 - It was to clean floors or wallpaper or whatever, yeah.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.880
 And then people say Listerine made up.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.120
 - Some of them invented, yeah.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.480
 - Invented halitosis.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.480
 - Invented halitosis, yeah.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.320
 - Everyone had amazing breath before that.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.400
 - Yeah, it's like, what?

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.720
 The halitosis is rank, bad breath.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.920
 You want to clear it up.

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.040
 So yeah, there is this thing.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.800
 And they turned it into kind of a medical problem.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.880
 But halitosis is often caused by bacteria

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.800
 and bad bacteria in your mouth.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.920
 So I always feel a bit bad for Listerine

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.760
 because they did try to fix bad breath.

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:42.120
 I'm not saying that mouthwash necessarily does.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.320
 And in fact, it can make bad breath worse.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.800
 And particularly mouthwash that contains alcohol.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.640
 - You know, most mouthwash does.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.100
 It contains about 25% alcohol.

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:53.200
 People tend to think, why is that?

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.040
 Why would you assume that was?

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:54.880
 - Fun.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.600
 (laughing)

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.080
 - You can have a good night in.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.120
 - I would say alcohol is antiseptic.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:00.960
 - Yeah.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:01.800
 - Bacteria.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.200
 - Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.520
 So you'd need about 60 to 90% concentration of alcohol.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.040
 So you'd need to be drinking very hardcore absinthe

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.040
 to have any effect on bacteria.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.880
 - So I should do that every morning, shouldn't I?

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:13.720
 (laughing)

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:14.560
 - It's the right color, right?

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:15.400
 Green absinthe.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.240
 - Yeah, same color.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.080
 - Perfect, yeah.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.880
 Swapping out for some very strong absinthe.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.200
 But yeah, the reason it's there

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.520
 is basically sort of as an agent to dissolve other stuff.

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.360
 But also 'cause it gives you that burning feeling

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.920
 that makes you feel like it's being really effective.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.480
 And so it's actually worse

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.720
 'cause alcohol dries your mouth out,

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.080
 like stops you salivating as much.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:35.120
 And that makes a good environment for bacteria.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.160
 - What, a dry mouth?

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.040
 - Yeah, weirdly, 'cause they like moisture,

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:40.240
 but your saliva has an acidity level

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.160
 which counterbalances what the bacteria want to live in.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.000
 - No, I do.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:44.840
 - Yeah.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:45.960
 - We have a mutual buddy

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.640
 who I was out for a drink with a while ago.

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.800
 And mid-drink, he pulled out a bottle of listerine,

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.160
 took a shot of it and just drank it down and put it away.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.640
 - He's having a tough time at the moment.

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.000
 (laughing)

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.120
 - He said, yeah, you can drink it.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:00.200
 It's like, he was saying, he was using it for his breath.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.360
 He was using it to just have a nice swig

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.040
 and reset his mouth, but--

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.200
 - You can't drink it, yeah.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.040
 - Yeah, I didn't know that,

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.440
 'cause I've been spitting it out this whole time.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.440
 - You're supposed to spit it out.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.760
 - You're supposed to spit it out.

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.200
 You were right to bring it up

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.600
 as an unusual thing till it happened.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.360
 - I suppose if you're at the pub,

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.960
 most people don't use listerine

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.280
 when they're sitting in the pub with their mates.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.120
 If you're around the table,

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.160
 you can't just spit on the floor, can you?

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.920
 - No, I usually get a shot of listerine

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.280
 and put it in some Red Bull.

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.520
 (laughing)

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.720
 - Do you want to hear something quite off-topic?

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:30.560
 - Sure.

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.880
 (laughing)

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.000
 - Okay.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.080
 It is about things you have in your mouth.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.360
 - Okay, great.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.400
 - It's pretty on-topic, actually.

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:38.400
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.760
 Depends on where you go with it.

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.760
 - Some fish are called mouth brooders, right?

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:44.600
 - Oh, yeah.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.960
 - And they bring up their offspring,

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.360
 their babies, in their mouths,

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.880
 before eventually opening their mouths

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.200
 when they're ready to go.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.360
 - So they're kind of safe to grow a little bit in there.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.720
 - Yeah, they're complete, exactly.

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:55.560
 They're safe from predators.

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:56.480
 That's the main thing.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.560
 Some fish, which are mouth brooders,

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.080
 deal with the stress of parenthood

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.400
 by eating their children.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.480
 (laughing)

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:04.880
 - What, just have a quick swallow?

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:05.720
 - Yeah.

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:06.560
 - Right.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.120
 - Is it when their children are really, really naughty

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.080
 or they're sleep deprived,

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.680
 are they particularly prone to swallow their kids?

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:11.520
 - It's when the mother,

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.640
 'cause in the species it's the mother fish,

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.040
 is stressed, she's more prone to swallowing.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:18.520
 So they've tried playing loud noises at the fish,

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:19.680
 which stresses them out.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.560
 And then she'll swallow a few for children.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:22.560
 - Oh, God.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.000
 - I bet parents are empathizing

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.640
 all over the country as they listen.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.280
 - It might mean that they get,

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.080
 well, they get some nutrition for one thing,

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.000
 which is helpful,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.920
 but also they might get some antioxidants.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.240
 - Some bloody piece of choir.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:36.280
 (laughing)

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.680
 - The funny thing with extinction is,

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:43.840
 is that, you know, it's not suddenly recorded on the spot.

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:47.920
 It takes years to get to that decision where I think,

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.760
 you know what, I haven't seen these things for quite a while.

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:51.600
 How long's it been?

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.120
 A couple of months, I'll give it another year.

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.480
 Let's have another look at it.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.040
 You know, and then 30 years later,

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.160
 like, I've got to be honest with you,

00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:59.840
 it's been 30 years now.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:00.680
 We probably,

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.000
 should we write it down that they're gone?

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.080
 And even then something will spring up.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.040
 Oh no, there they are.

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.040
 Gosh, God, we shouldn't have written that down.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:07.880
 Did you write that down?

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:08.720
 Yeah, it's been,

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.880
 it's gone out in all the books.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.200
 Well, I've just seen one.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.800
 So, you know what I mean?

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:13.640
 It's kind of like,

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.200
 and that must happen quite often.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.040
 - It's hard to draw the line.

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:16.880
 - Cecilia Kanth.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.240
 That was a long, long time, right?

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.080
 How long was that?

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.080
 - That was 65 million years, that one,

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:21.920
 which was...

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:23.800
 (laughing)

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.520
 - Shall we wait 66 million years?

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:27.080
 - Yes, let's wait 66 million years.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.880
 It's a nice round number.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:29.720
 And then we'll,

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:30.840
 no, let's do it now.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.040
 - Let's publish the book.

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.280
 - He definitely did box out, Dal.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.400
 Let's have a look and see what's did this year.

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.240
 What?

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.080
 The Cecilia Kanth.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.760
 I saw one this morning.

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:40.920
 No, it's in there.

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:41.760
 It's in there.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:42.920
 First page.

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:43.760
 That's off.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.000
 I found one this morning.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.240
 All right, give 'em a call.

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:47.920
 (laughing)

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:48.760
 Hello?

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:49.600
 Things are dead.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.440
 Yes, listen, mate.

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:51.880
 Your latest edition.

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:52.880
 The Cecilia Kanth.

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:53.800
 Page one.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:54.760
 Court one this morning.

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.000
 Oh, you're shitting me.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.720
 No, I'm so sorry.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.080
 Did you come around our area?

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.880
 No, didn't bother with it.

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:05.240
 (laughing)

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:06.640
 So you never know.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:07.480
 (laughing)

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:08.880
 That's just what I'm saying.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:10.600
 (laughing)

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.080
 - You're not the first with this series

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:15.200
 to sort of reinvigorate the name of Steve Bonnet.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:18.760
 2013, he was a character in Assassin's Creed.

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:19.600
 - That's right.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:20.440
 - Which was, yeah.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.440
 And it was called Black Flag.

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.360
 And it was a, yeah, 2013 game

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.200
 in which there was a lot of pirates.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.320
 It was the fourth in the Assassin's Creed games.

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:32.280
 And one really interesting detail about it

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.680
 is how they promoted this whole game,

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:36.480
 which was they decided,

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.840
 like most people would be like,

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.280
 "Let's get posters up everywhere

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.760
 "or let's do some publicity in bringing a celebrity."

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:46.160
 And they decided to exhume a dead pirate

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.080
 from his grave to do DNA tests on him.

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:53.160
 Yeah, so the company that makes Assassin's Creed,

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.920
 they funded archeologists to go and find a pirate

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:58.760
 who was known as Amaro Pargo.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.440
 This was a big mission where they had to remove

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.000
 a giant slab of marble.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.920
 They assumed that they knew where he was buried

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:05.360
 and they were correct in the end.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.440
 And they found this whole booty

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.040
 of other dead people as well.

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:09.960
 Like it wasn't just him.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.160
 It was like his nieces and nephews.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.880
 - Why are they doing this?

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:15.640
 - Can I just say, I don't know if that's the right term,

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:17.320
 a booty of dead people.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.200
 (laughing)

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.080
 What's in your booty?

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.080
 Dead people.

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:26.080
 - That just sounds a bit piratey, I guess.

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.480
 - But yeah, so they managed to find him.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.840
 They found all these details about him.

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:32.040
 He was about five foot, four inches tall.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:36.440
 Yeah, he was quite a robust character.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.840
 - And then what purpose did they serve

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:40.120
 except for like giving the makers nightmares?

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.360
 Did they then base the character in Assassin's Creed

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:45.440
 completely on this weird corpse that they'd found?

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:47.000
 - What's weird is I don't think

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.040
 he's in the game.

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:52.400
 - No, 'cause you said it's just Steve in the game.

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:53.240
 It's just weird.

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:54.080
 - No, no, no, it's not Steve.

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.600
 Steve's a character in the game.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:56.600
 There's lots of pirates

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.040
 and there's lots of historical pirates.

00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.720
 And it was while they were doing the development,

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:01.320
 they were researching the game

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.800
 and they found this guy and they thought,

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.160
 God, he's such an interesting character.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:05.480
 Why is he unknown?

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.240
 And so they then got in touch

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.840
 with this company of archeologists

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.840
 and they said, would you dig him up for us?

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:15.760
 I think they had plans probably to do that anyway.

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:16.920
 - And they just wanted publicity.

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:17.760
 - Yeah, they wanted publicity.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:19.880
 - They wanted people to talk about it on podcasts

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:20.720
 10 years later.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:21.560
 - Exactly.

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:22.720
 - You've fallen right into the trap

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.760
 of this weird modern day Birkenhair freak.

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:26.600
 - Do we keep doing this?

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.360
 This will be a conversation piece, Trump.

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:29.440
 We've got to keep doing this.

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.280
 This will come up.

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.120
 This will pop up.

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:31.960
 There'll be something.

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.080
 Someone will talk about it.

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:33.920
 - I don't know.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:34.920
 It feels weird.

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:38.720
 You get banana split eating contests.

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:39.560
 - Oh yeah.

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:42.000
 - Which I found underwhelming, if I'm honest.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.880
 And I thought maybe we could enter one.

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:44.720
 - Okay.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:45.560
 - Okay.

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:46.400
 - Great.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:50.040
 - You know, there's surveys where they ask a load of men

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:52.400
 if they can beat Serena Williams in a tennis match.

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.240
 - Oh yeah.

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.080
 - And they all say they can.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.480
 I think this is the Anna equivalent of it.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:58.760
 It's like, I could beat anyone in an eating contest.

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:00.040
 - An eating contest I see.

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:02.160
 - You think we could win a banana split contest?

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:03.680
 - Well, listen to this.

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.560
 I was reading about the one that's held in Maryland

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:08.680
 and it's an annual Jimmy Cone banana split eating contest.

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.280
 And I was reading the report for the 2015 one.

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.560
 I don't know how much people have improved since then.

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:17.120
 But in the kids contest, it was won fittingly

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:19.120
 by someone called Tommy Aites.

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:19.960
 - Oh, brilliant.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:23.160
 - And he was 12 and he had 20 minutes

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.520
 and he got through 2.5 banana splits.

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:29.120
 - I think that if he was 12, this could be a kids thing.

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:30.720
 - No, there is an adult round.

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:31.560
 - Is there?

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:32.880
 - I've kind of deep-raised this.

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:33.720
 But the adult round.

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.360
 - I've got to see Anna Hodlin into this kids contest.

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.680
 I can bite the floor with a lot of you.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:40.560
 - I intend to try and enter the kids one first.

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.280
 - Obviously, I'll wear some armbands or something.

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:50.400
 The adult one, I think the winner got through

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.720
 four banana splits in half an hour.

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:54.560
 - Half an hour?

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:55.400
 - I believe it was.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.000
 Isn't that so crap?

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.600
 - That's four bananas and 12 scoops of ice cream.

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:00.440
 - Yeah.

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:01.280
 - In half an hour.

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.120
 - In half an hour, yeah.

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:03.360
 But no, I'm not saying it's a timing.

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:04.440
 I'm saying it's a capacity thing.

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:05.280
 That's a lot of...

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.440
 - It certainly is capacity.

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.600
 They say the best way to do it is to do it slowly

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:09.680
 because everyone's vomiting.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:12.360
 In fact, Tommy, sweetly Tommy eights when he won,

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:13.280
 he was interviewed and they were like,

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:14.440
 "How was that, Tommy?"

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:15.960
 And he said, "It was awesome."

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.600
 And then immediately vomited into the bucket

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:18.920
 that was provided.

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:19.760
 - Disqualified.

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:22.960
 - You know moon rock.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:23.800
 - Yeah, man.

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:24.720
 - Yeah, it's from the moon.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:25.760
 - Rock from the moon.

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:29.040
 So the Apollo 11 astronauts got a load of rocks down

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.560
 when they came back from the moon.

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:34.960
 And 7.5% of that rock was fed to animals.

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:35.800
 - No!

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.920
 - Yeah, 'cause they wanted to know what would happen

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:39.280
 if you gave it to animals.

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:41.400
 Would it, is it carcinogenic?

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:42.400
 Would it make them sick?

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.600
 All these different things.

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:46.160
 So there was a woman called Marion Brooks

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.760
 who worked at the University of St. Paul

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.320
 and she was given all this stuff

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:54.360
 and she gave it to oysters, shrimps, cockroaches, flies,

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:57.520
 moths, fish, and just kept giving little bits.

00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.360
 And some of them were giving it to eat.

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.280
 Some of them were inoculated with it.

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:03.240
 Some of them were just allowed to crawl around it

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:04.880
 and they wanted to see if they would die.

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.040
 - That is incredible.

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:06.880
 - Isn't that cool?

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:08.200
 - And what happened?

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.440
 - They were all fine 'cause it's just rock.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:14.800
 But some of the fish died.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:17.000
 But that's because someone dropped a bottle of sodium

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.680
 hydrochloride next to where they lived

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:21.360
 and so they died of the fumes.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.160
 And a couple of oysters died

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:26.600
 because they pooed in their own water and they died.

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.720
 But none of them died because of the rocks.

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:31.960
 - I was gonna bid very recently

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:35.400
 on a couple of cockroaches that were up for auction

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:39.000
 that the moon dust was still inside.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:39.840
 - Oh wow.

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:40.680
 - So you were getting the moon dust.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:41.960
 - Your children would have loved that.

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:43.080
 - They would have loved it.

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:46.040
 Unfortunately, NASA took it off the bidding

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:46.880
 because they decided--

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:47.720
 - 'Cause you're not allowed to sell that.

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:48.560
 - You're not allowed to sell that, exactly.

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:49.680
 - Even if they're inside a cockroach.

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:50.520
 - Even if they're inside a cockroach.

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:51.360
 - Really?

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.200
 - Even if they ground up dust in there.

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.040
 - The cockroach is dead, right?

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.200
 - Yeah, it's dead.

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.760
 So this was back in the '60s, but they kept the cockroaches

00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:59.240
 and they had the moon dust still inside them.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.800
 - What kind of price would you have paid?

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:04.240
 - Oh, you know, that was going for a good mill, I think.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.080
 So I would have been one of those just, you know,

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.400
 token early voters.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:10.320
 - A lower bid, but with a lovely letter attached to it.

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:12.360
 Saying this would really mean a lot to me.

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:13.200
 - Yes, exactly.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.560
 - 'Cause sometimes auctioneers do take,

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:15.880
 they look kindly on that, you know?

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:17.280
 - Yeah, so I've got a bit of Berlin Wall

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:20.080
 that would look nice next to that in the house.

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.160
 - Wow, that's cool.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:25.640
 - Yeah, NASA are so pedantic, in my experience.

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:26.480
 (laughing)

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:27.320
 - Psycho.

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:28.400
 - Psycho.

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.360
 - Yes, because you know that I have spoken

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:32.600
 to a national on the International Space Station.

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:33.440
 - Oh, who was that?

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:34.280
 - I know this, yeah.

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:36.640
 - Yeah, she's a fan of my dad, Brett Aporno,

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:40.040
 and NASA astronauts are allowed a mental health call

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.960
 every few weeks when they're up there.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.360
 She chose to speak to me.

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:45.320
 - You.

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.040
 - Honestly, she could have chosen anyone.

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:49.080
 - That would surely trigger a bigger intervention

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.480
 from the mental health team.

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:51.320
 (laughing)

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:52.160
 - Exactly, yeah.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:53.000
 - I'll speak to this guy.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.760
 (laughing)

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:55.600
 - But I was like--

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.960
 - Restrain her, restrain her now, put her in the brig.

00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:59.320
 - That was like NASA.

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:02.760
 They're gonna have the most amazing like communication

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:05.360
 and software, Microsoft Teams.

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:06.640
 (laughing)

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.400
 Is what I used to speak to space.

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:10.240
 - Amazing.

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:11.080
 - Yeah, insane.

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:12.400
 And they were very, they were like,

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.360
 you can't take any pictures,

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:15.160
 you can't even do a screen grab.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.000
 - Wow.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.760
 - NASA was just so annoying.

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.680
 - How did they know you hadn't done a screen grab?

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.520
 - Well, this is the thing.

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:23.040
 I was so paranoid that my whole computer's bugged.

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:23.880
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:27.520
 - To my wifi connection, and so I didn't dare do one.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.360
 But so--

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:29.200
 - Wow.

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:31.480
 - Although I think I do have a photo of us.

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:32.320
 - What did you talk about?

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:33.160
 Was it her?

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.560
 Who was asking who questions?

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:37.080
 - Well, I think it was supposed to be her

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:38.560
 asking us questions, but we just asked her

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:39.960
 a million questions about being in space.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:42.760
 And she gave us a tour of the whole station.

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:43.760
 It was incredible.

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.680
 Showed us Earth from like the windows.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:46.520
 - That's so cool.

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:47.360
 What was her name?

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:48.520
 - I'm not sure if I can say the name,

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:49.360
 just in case--

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:50.200
 - Oh, really?

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.200
 - Natter do get in, you know.

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.500
 - If any astronauts are listening

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.120
 and want to talk about rocks, Andy, you're--

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:55.480
 - Oh my God, I'm so free.

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.800
 (laughing)

00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:57.640
 - Yeah.

00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.200
 - Apparently they listened to a lot of podcasts up there.

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.040
 So--

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:00.860
 - Oh, okay, right.

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:02.320
 - Edward Aporno.

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.160
 - Right.

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:04.320
 - It wasn't this, but, you know.

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:07.200
 (laughing)

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.120
 - I've got one more fact about tiny dust.

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.120
 - Gosh, please.

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.240
 - This is a really cool idea.

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:12.840
 It's the idea that you can use crushed rocks

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:13.960
 to fight climate change.

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:15.600
 I think it's best to come across this.

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:19.040
 So, basalt is a rock that's volcanic.

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:21.720
 And when rain falls, so this is the problem.

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:24.400
 Rain falls, it combines with carbon dioxide in the air,

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.120
 becomes slightly acidic, right?

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:27.680
 And the problem is obviously too much carbon dioxide

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:30.280
 in the air, that's the main cause of climate change.

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:33.280
 If that acidic rain hits particular rock types,

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:35.800
 it can cause a chemical reaction which kind of locks up

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.100
 the carbon dioxide, removes it from the atmosphere,

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:39.300
 which is a good thing.

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:42.420
 And if you spread basalt dust across a field,

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:44.940
 just an ordinary field, you massively increase

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:46.420
 the surface area, that reaction will happen,

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:47.860
 like a hundred fold or more than that.

00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:48.980
 And that's the plan.

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:51.540
 That carbon is captured, it washes down rivers,

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:53.580
 animals like oysters might put it in their shells.

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:55.580
 When they die, the shells fall to the bottom of the ocean.

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:58.220
 That carbon is just sequestered indefinitely.

00:22:58.220 --> 00:22:59.060
 - Oh, that's a problem.

00:22:59.060 --> 00:22:59.900
 - Yeah, that's the problem.

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:00.740
 - So that's the idea.

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:02.240
 It's still in the research stage at the moment,

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.840
 but it is, you know, that's a dream,

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:05.200
 that it will be one of the methods

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:07.000
 we could use to fight climate change.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.760
 It would use only 0.2% of UK electricity generation.

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:12.520
 - You won't be able to grow stuff on those fields, right?

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:13.360
 - I think you still can.

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:14.200
 I think that's the point.

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:15.640
 Yeah, yeah, it's just a very fine layer of dust.

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:17.280
 In fact, it even increases crop yields in some cases.

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:18.520
 - You could put it on golf courses,

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:19.360
 couldn't you?

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:20.200
 That might work.

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:21.040
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:21.880
 - It's a green space.

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:22.720
 - Yeah, exactly, yeah.

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:23.540
 - That's really good.

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:24.380
 - Yeah, that's the plan.

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:25.220
 - So good news.

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:28.220
 - We can all get planes again.

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:31.060
 (all laughing)

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:32.220
 - But the Muppet Show is sort of for adults

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:34.400
 and for children, as in the original TV series,

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.080
 as you know, and lots of the Muppets

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:38.300
 have quite serious problems in their lives.

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:41.500
 Gonzo is depressive, and Kermit is incredibly stressed,

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:43.060
 and there's all sorts of stuff going on.

00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:44.340
 - That's not homeless.

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:45.180
 - Oh, well, he's Sesame Street,

00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:47.020
 so he's different universe, but uh...

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:48.460
 - 'Cause Sesame Street is for kids, right?

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:52.380
 - Count on Count has erythomomania,

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:54.540
 which is a mental illness

00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:56.500
 where you have a clouding obsession

00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:59.100
 with numbers and mathematical processes,

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:01.220
 which interferes with your everyday life.

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:02.140
 - That's...

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:03.380
 Wait, hang on.

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:04.700
 - There, hang on.

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:05.540
 - You don't know about it, Andy.

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:06.860
 - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:10.340
 - I remember thinking 257,000 minutes ago.

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:11.780
 (all laughing)

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:13.700
 - But there's a thing about vampires.

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:14.680
 There's a myth about vampires,

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:16.820
 that if you throw grains of rice on the ground,

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:18.180
 then they'll have to be obsessed with it.

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:20.140
 So is that where the counting thing from?

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:20.980
 - Well, we don't know for sure,

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:23.580
 but it seems likely that that's where that comes from.

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:26.500
 But yeah, obviously the erythomomania

00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:29.020
 is not necessarily that he suffers from that.

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:30.620
 - Or is it 'cause he's called the Count?

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:31.460
 - Yeah, it could be that.

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:33.020
 - It's just, I think it's kind of worth it.

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:35.580
 (all laughing)

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:38.340
 - There was a complaint by a guy called Joseph B. Regoli

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:41.300
 in 1979 that the Count von Counts

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:44.100
 might mislead children into trusting Dracula

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:46.300
 and possibly monsters in general.

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:48.460
 - Because he was such a nice character.

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:51.180
 - And everyone loved him, but actually he was a bad guy.

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:55.620
 And maybe kids need to learn to not trust the bad guys.

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:57.860
 - Not trust Dracula when he's not on your door.

00:24:57.860 --> 00:24:59.380
 Don't invite him in.

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:01.100
 Keep the garlic safe.

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:04.620
 - And the Sesame Street people replied saying

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:06.100
 that we've tried to make it clear

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:08.740
 that the Count is not a representative of evil.

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:11.340
 (all laughing)

00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:13.180
 - God.

00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:16.020
 - Just on why things floating and things sinking.

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:16.860
 - Yeah.

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:18.420
 - There's been some new research done recently

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:22.060
 into why some poo's float and some poo's sink.

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:22.900
 - Okay.

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:23.740
 - This is really exciting.

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:24.580
 - This is very exciting.

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:25.420
 - This is useful.

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:27.660
 - So I think it's about 10 to 15% of people

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:29.180
 that poo's always float.

00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:30.820
 And almost everyone else that poo's always sink.

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:31.660
 So.

00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:33.900
 - Hang on, sorry, but most of us have

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:35.660
 sometimes float, sometimes sink, right?

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:36.860
 - Yeah.

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:38.820
 But people have 10, people tend one way or the other.

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:39.660
 - Okay, got it.

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:41.540
 - Like some people, it's universal one way or the other.

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:43.820
 And it's 10 to 15, it's sort of always,

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:44.660
 they're always floating.

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:48.100
 So, I know, and it's to do with,

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:49.260
 you're not going to be staggered,

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:51.500
 the gas content of the actual poo.

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:54.580
 But there was a theory it was to do with fat content,

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:56.220
 as in because the fat cells in the mud.

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:57.380
 - Yeah, exactly, yeah.

00:25:57.380 --> 00:26:00.980
 And so the initial experiment was done by a scientist

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:02.660
 called Michael Levitt and William Dwayne,

00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:03.940
 and this was in 1972.

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:05.020
 And they were the ones who first showed

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:06.180
 it was to do with gas.

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:07.100
 I just loved this.

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:08.260
 One of them said to the other,

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:09.500
 my poo's always float.

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:11.860
 And, oh, that's interesting, I wonder why.

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:14.740
 And so they collected floaters

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:17.220
 from 13 experimental subjects.

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:18.060
 - Right.

00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:21.060
 - I had no idea how they opened those conversations.

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:24.060
 And they increased the pressurization on the poo's

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:26.060
 to remove the gas, and then they all sank.

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:27.740
 And irrespective of the fat content.

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:28.980
 So that's how they proved that.

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:32.420
 The new research is from Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:36.180
 And it's a scientist called Nagarajan Kanan and colleagues

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:39.980
 who bred some mice with no gut bacteria.

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:42.980
 And it means they always produce sinkers.

00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:43.820
 - Okay.

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:44.940
 - It's gas from the gut microbes.

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:45.780
 - Gas, how interesting.

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:47.100
 - Yeah, it's normal mice, it's 50/50.

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:48.660
 But these special GM--

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:51.460
 - So if you're one of the 14%,

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:54.020
 if you were to eat some yakult for a few days,

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:55.740
 do you think your poo's would stop?

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:57.060
 - I don't think that research has been done.

00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:00.980
 I think that's a great next journey for this experiment.

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:03.100
 - The yakult actually increases good bacteria.

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:04.260
 So I would have thought that makes it float.

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:05.900
 - Well, it changes your microbiome, doesn't it?

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:07.780
 - Changes, I wonder.

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:10.140
 - What does it mean for Anna then, though, who's poo's?

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:11.620
 (all laughing)

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:13.460
 I would think Anna's.

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:16.420
 - Anna's are shroding as poo's.

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:18.660
 And you don't know whether they'll sink or float

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:20.500
 until they're out.

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:22.260
 - It's sort of both at the same time.

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:24.060
 (all laughing)

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:25.420
 - It's sort of listing.

00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:28.980
 - Yeah, you actually put armbands on them sometimes.

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:30.700
 Get them back up to the surface.

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:33.740
 - There's an episode where Fred is playing Scrabble.

00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:35.700
 And he's just trying to save face

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:37.020
 'cause he doesn't know many words.

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:38.780
 And so he makes up a word

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:40.300
 to try and get some extra points.

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:42.300
 And the word that they thought was made up,

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:43.660
 which possibly was at the time--

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:44.500
 - Brexit.

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:47.780
 (all laughing)

00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:49.020
 - Was zarf.

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:51.100
 - Oh, no way.

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:52.020
 Oh my God.

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:55.260
 - Zarf is an exciting word that I introduced

00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:58.060
 to our listeners and the fellow fishers.

00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:00.100
 A while ago, zarf is, do you know what it is?

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:01.260
 - Yes, what?

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:02.740
 - I love that episode.

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:05.420
 (all laughing)

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:06.740
 - God, what a chance.

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:08.300
 - We probably don't need to go over it again.

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:10.820
 - No, no, no, no, what was it?

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:12.700
 - You know, when you go into a coffee shop

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:14.660
 and you get a coffee and it's a bit too hot,

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:16.460
 and they give you that little cardboard sleeve

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:18.060
 that goes under it, that's a zarf.

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:18.900
 - No.

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:19.740
 - Yes.

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:21.620
 So maybe the person who came up with the name of the zarf

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:23.020
 had seen this episode of the Flintstones.

00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:24.540
 - And went, ooh, there's a word going for spare.

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:25.380
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:27.340
 - I think the word zarf did exist before then

00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:29.020
 'cause I've since looked it up.

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:33.820
 And a zarf in places like Russia and Turkey and stuff,

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:36.420
 you have like a glass cup for coffee.

00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:38.860
 And then they have like a metal holder

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:40.860
 that the glass goes in and that's known as a zarf.

00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:41.700
 - You're kidding.

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:42.540
 - Oh my God.

00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:44.580
 - So it's a proper thing and then they use the word

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:45.620
 to refer to the cardboard.

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:46.460
 - That's what I've got.

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:47.300
 That's really interesting.

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:48.140
 - That's really cool.

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:49.140
 - That's, yeah.

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:53.020
 - Well, one of the videos I saw sort of screws up

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:55.820
 because the tram has to go at quite a pace

00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:57.540
 to hit the inflatable ball.

00:28:57.540 --> 00:28:58.860
 And then the idea is that the ball rolls

00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:01.620
 into these giant inflatable skittles and knocks them down.

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:03.620
 But the tram does struggle to slow down.

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:06.220
 So what you see is a ball knocking into the skittles

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:07.420
 and then immediately afterwards,

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:09.540
 the tram mowing down all of the skittles.

00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:10.380
 - Oh, that's no point.

00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:11.220
 That's no point.

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:12.060
 - That's no point.

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:12.900
 - Just to break the forehand.

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:13.740
 - As in bowling.

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:16.980
 - I thought it looked, I think it looked good too.

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:20.380
 - Wait, you're not allowed to chase your ball down the...

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:21.900
 - Shit.

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:24.460
 - I'm always getting lifted up by those claws at the end.

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:26.720
 (laughing)

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:29.820
 - Just rolling back up there.

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:33.060
 (laughing)

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:36.060
 - Popping out, someone puts his hand in your face.

00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:37.740
 - Two up the nose, one in the mouth.

00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:38.980
 (laughing)

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:39.820
 Really to the go.

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:40.900
 I'm a large size.

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:43.480
 (upbeat music)

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:46.060
 (upbeat music)

00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:48.640
 (upbeat music)

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:51.220
 (upbeat music)

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:53.800
 (upbeat music)
