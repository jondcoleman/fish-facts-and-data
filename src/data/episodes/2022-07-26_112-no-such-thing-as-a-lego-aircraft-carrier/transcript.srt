6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Hello and welcome to another episode.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 And no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 This week coming to you from Edinburgh.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 My name is Dan Schreiber. Please welcome to the stage.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 It's Anichesinski, Jane Tarkin and Andy Murray.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 [Cheering]

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 [Cheering]

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 [Cheering]

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 from the last seven days and in a particular order. Here we go.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Starting with you, Andrew Hunter Murray.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 My fact this week is that Antarctica exports used toilet paper.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 [Laughter]

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Who wants it? I see why they want to get rid of it.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 I want to know who wants it at the other end.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Well, it's not so much that anyone else wants it.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 [Laughter]

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 So there are loads of different research bases in Antarctica.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 They used to do very bad things.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 They used to just dump it into the sea.

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 And that can obviously be very bad or introduces foreign microorganisms

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 which can then have knock on effects on the whole ecosystem.

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 So some people incinerate it now.

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 But there are companies which do tourism to Antarctica

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 and they export feces and urine and usually paper.

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 Hang on, so that's part of the holiday you sign up to

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 as you go to watch them picking up used toilet paper.

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 [Laughter]

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 It's not a big part of the itinerary.

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 But if you are doing an expedition to the pole or outside a research base

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 you basically have to carry your own poo behind you on the sled.

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Wow! Yeah!

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 But the good thing is it freezes, so it's better.

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Right? It's not the most silver of life.

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 Do you guys remember that story?

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Just speaking of it freezing, a poo freezing.

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 There was a story told by an explorer called Wade Davis,

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 a big anthropologist, amazing guy.

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 And he was talking about a guy who I can't remember where exactly he lived.

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 But there was a lot of ice.

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 And he refused to move.

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 There were people trying to say you should move out of here

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 and he said I don't want to move out of here.

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 So what he ended up doing was building up weapons

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 that he could use against them.

52
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 And what he did was he made a poo knife.

53
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 So he froze his poo and he positioned it in its shape

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 to be knife-like. And when it froze he had a dagger.

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 And it was for attacking people not for eating with.

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Well, it probably doubled up to be honest.

57
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Did he ever get to wield it?

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Quite a weird story. He ended up saying that he had to give you huskies

59
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 and he said he eventually escaped the place.

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 And what he did was he had to have a sled.

61
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 So he killed one of his huskies with the poo knife.

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 He then ate the food of the dog in order to survive.

63
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Then he crafted the inside bones of the ribcage into a small sled

64
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 and he tucked his poo knife into his belt.

65
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 And he rode off into the distance.

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 This is made up.

67
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 I promise you, this is a dream.

68
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 I promise you, wave David, screw it with.

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Wave David's poo knife.

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 You would...

71
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 I reckon if you Googled just poo knife.

72
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 It's not maybe there's like a hundred different things.

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 It's like I'm going to have to know all this stuff.

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 So when Shackleton went to the South Pole,

75
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 they ran out of toilet paper very quickly.

76
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 But what they did have was two full editions of the Encyclopedia Britannica.

77
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Yeah.

78
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 And so when it got desperate, that's what they used.

79
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 They used it for also for smoking tobacco, as well as for toilet paper.

80
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 But Dr. Alexander Maclin, who was a surgeon, tore out the entry on scurvy

81
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 because he didn't want anyone wiping with it.

82
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Because he thought it was really, really important.

83
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 Really?

84
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 And there was a physicist there called Reginald James,

85
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 who saved the section on geometry.

86
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 Right.

87
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 What if we get to the pole and there's a test?

88
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 I think books have been used through the centuries, haven't they?

89
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 As you'd imagine, really, because toilet paper wasn't invented

90
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 relatively recently.

91
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 And so, yeah, the ability would use pages of books to wipe their arses with.

92
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 I think a popular thing that people used as lurel in America was corn on the cob

93
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 until toilet paper was invented.

94
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 Isn't it the case with corn on the cob that it's one of those foods that actually comes out as corn still on the other side?

95
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 So you'd be wiping it and you're just putting it back on

96
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 to the thing you just ate.

97
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 So there's an almanac called the Farmers Almanac,

98
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 which still exists today, I think.

99
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 From 1818, the Farmers Almanac in America came with a hole punched in the top left-hand corner, I think.

100
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 And that was because it was known that people would use it once they'd read it or made read it or whatever.

101
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 They'd pin it to their wall and they'd use it as lurel.

102
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 And so it came with a hole pre-punched in it so that they could buy it into the world.

103
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 That's really interesting.

104
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 We write books for QI.

105
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 And when we did a fact book, we got a request from the Netherlands and they said we want to put a hole in the top corner.

106
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 They said it was for the shower.

107
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 So they could read it in the shower, but that never made sense to me.

108
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 No one reads in the shower.

109
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 No, they don't, do they?

110
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 But they do write the buns with things.

111
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 Yeah.

112
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 So the world's most expensive toilet paper is £825,000 a roll.

113
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 Okay.

114
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 It's personally delivered to you with a bottle of champagne.

115
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 And as you use it, 24-karat gold flakes will fall to the floor and you're behind taking you to another level of sophistication.

116
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 That's according to their website.

117
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 They've only managed to make one roll at the moment and I don't think they've actually sold it.

118
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 But if you've got £800,000 a spare?

119
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Saddam Hussein had a solid gold toilet roll holder, actually, didn't he?

120
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 I was actually speaking of world leaders.

121
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 I was looking into what Obama has.

122
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 I thought the White House must have some interesting toilet paper.

123
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 And actually, and they do.

124
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 But it's not incredible.

125
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 It's just got the presidential seal on a bunch of toilet paper.

126
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 Really that's disrespectful.

127
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Yeah, you'd think actually.

128
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 Yeah.

129
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 So I was thinking about the Pope as well.

130
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 I thought what does he use?

131
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 He uses the doves.

132
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 I know this.

133
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 It just has a whole box of doves in the loop.

134
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 That's lovely.

135
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 I've got a fact about the Antarctic.

136
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 But I feel we've...

137
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 No, let's go back.

138
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 I was just going to say about the Pope.

139
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 We know a bit about the toilet paper.

140
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 Not in his actual paper in the Vatican, but he has a summer house.

141
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 And we know about it because my lean class, the single stole a roll of the toilet paper.

142
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 She hands it out as Christmas presents now.

143
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 She collects weird things from around the world.

144
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Let's go back to the Arctic.

145
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 Sounds like hearsay to me.

146
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 Oh!

147
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 See, niche early 2000s reference that.

148
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Yeah.

149
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 Sorry, Andy, go on.

150
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 How can I follow that?

151
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 So there's a thing...

152
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 They have a holiday in the Antarctic.

153
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 People are staying there, called Midwinter Day.

154
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 And I got this from an interview with a woman who'd been living there for eight years,

155
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 called Kerry Nelson.

156
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 And she said, "It feels like a real holiday."

157
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 And people actually send e-greeting cars to each other from other stations,

158
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 saying things like, "Happy Midwinter, come stop by our station for dinner."

159
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 Which nobody can, because we're also isolated.

160
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 So it's kind of a joke.

161
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 Sounds like the worst holiday ever.

162
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 I know, and they're so isolated.

163
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 You can't get to another station most of the year.

164
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 And they're so far apart from each other, because it is massive.

165
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 So one thing they have had, they have darts tournaments over the phone.

166
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 Where you throw a dart, tell the other person what you've scored.

167
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 And then they throw a dart and they tell you.

168
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 I might be wrong about this, but something in the back of my head says they're in the...

169
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 So it's in the 20s or 30s.

170
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 They used to have darts on the radio.

171
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 And what they would do is you'd get a professional darts player who'd throw his score.

172
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 And then they would say, he got, let's say, 180 or whatever.

173
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 And then they'd have a gap of complete silence while you threw your darts.

174
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 And then they'd, after about 30 seconds, then he'd throw another three.

175
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 That did happen, didn't it?

176
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 Yeah, that did happen.

177
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 That's not what cricket's done, which has worked out during those bits, you have to have someone actually talking nonsense.

178
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 Yeah.

179
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 You can't just leave silence.

180
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Well, cricket doesn't leave a gap for you to take your own...

181
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 ...and for you to have an over.

182
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 Should we move on to our next round?

183
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 Yeah, let's do that.

184
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anitzynski.

185
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 Yeah, my fact is that planes are launched off aircraft carriers by catapult.

186
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 So they're catapulted off aircraft carriers?

187
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 So these are when we see those massive aircraft carriers, and you've only got that tiny runway,

188
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 and they suddenly just gain momentum really quickly.

189
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 Yeah, exactly.

190
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 There were always much too short for planes to gain the right amount of speed,

191
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 necessarily for them to take off.

192
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 So they just go crashing into the sea if they just used what planes normally use, which is their own acceleration.

193
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 So yeah, they've got these catapult set up, and they call them catapults, and they're controlled by a catapult officer,

194
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 the coolest dog in the world, who sits in the catapult control pod.

195
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 If you're looking up, look up an aircraft carrier, you've got the floor of the ship,

196
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 and then the catapult control pod is just this transparent disc that pops up in the floor,

197
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 and he sits with his head just above floor level, so he's at the level of...

198
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 ...his heads at the level of the plane's wheels.

199
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 And yet how it works is that it's by a system of pistons, so the planes sitting there,

200
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 and it's got these two cylinders attached to it, and these cylinders are about as long as the football pitch.

201
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 And there are pistons in the cylinders, and the catapult officer builds up all the lots of pressure behind the pistons.

202
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 And at the moment the plane needs to take off, he releases all of that pressure, and so of course the pistons are released,

203
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 and the force of that catapults the plane into the air, hopefully.

204
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 And it is the most terrifying thing I've ever read about.

205
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 The cool thing about these pistons is that they're steam powered.

206
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 It's a weird thing, the fighter jet is being launched by steam power, but that's what the pistons are full of.

207
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 The steam that's generated by the ship.

208
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 They're trying to make new ones out there that are like electoral magnets, and they'll use those instead,

209
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 and they're going to be much better because you need fewer people to work them,

210
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 and also you won't have to have massive steam pipes going on the side of your ship there,

211
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 because sometimes blow up.

212
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Right.

213
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 Yeah, they do. It's very dangerous. Things seem to blow up all the time on aircraft carriers, and people recently someone who was working on one of the US Navy's aircraft carriers,

214
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 I think, got sucked into the jet engine, as he was walking across the boat, and he was rescued actually before he got sucked into the propellant.

215
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 I think he got stuck. I haven't had to watch the footage.

216
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 Thank God he was wearing his enormous hat.

217
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 The new electromagnetic ones, so the normal launch, the normal catapult that we have at the moment for aircraft carriers,

218
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 they accelerate the plane from no miles an hour to 165 miles an hour in two seconds.

219
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 Wow.

220
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 And the new ones, they're going to be able to launch a plane every 45 seconds from a ship with this electromagnetic thing,

221
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 and while it's happening, it's using the same amount of electricity as a town.

222
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 What?

223
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 Yeah, that's amazing.

224
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 And it's very short. It's only three seconds that is using it, but it's exactly the same electricity consumption as a town.

225
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 Wow.

226
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 Wow.

227
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 I was reading about, because I was looking at pictures of the aircraft carriers, and they're ginormous, and I was trying to work out how big they actually are.

228
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 So the largest aircraft carrier that we have, if you took it out of the water and you flipped it up vertically, it would be taller.

229
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 This is the USS Enterprise, it would be taller than the Eiffel Tower.

230
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 Wow.

231
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 Yeah, in its verticalness.

232
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 Now, that's not even the biggest boat on Earth, right?

233
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 So just to give you those, to give you the numbers of this, the longest boat on Earth, which is an oil tanker, is 458 meters long.

234
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 If you flip that up on its side, that's taller than the Empire State Building.

235
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 Wow.

236
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 Yeah.

237
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 A boat is taller than the Empire State Building.

238
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 The biggest boats in the world are so big they can't get through the English Channel.

239
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 What?

240
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 I know, it's...

241
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 Did you read it in Dan's Book of Thoughts?

242
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 No, and it is...

243
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 No.

244
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 And it turns out it is true, because it's the depth, it's not the width.

245
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 Oh, that's the cheesy.

246
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 Oh, no, it is like they displace so much water that they actually can't fit through, because it's too shallow.

247
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 Wow.

248
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Do you know how many parts there are in the largest aircraft carriers?

249
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 This is the U.S. Nimitz class, which is part of the lace as well.

250
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 They have a billion individual pieces.

251
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 Wow.

252
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 A billion.

253
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 That's a billion things that can go wrong.

254
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 Yeah.

255
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 And they're put together like Lego.

256
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 It's so cool.

257
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 They make two or four-year-olds.

258
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 And if you tread on one at least, it hurts so much.

259
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 So another incredible thing that everyone has to know about is how landing happens on aircraft carriers.

260
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 So, in fact, question for you guys.

261
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 If you were landing an airplane on an aircraft carrier and you know you have to stop as soon as possible,

262
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 as soon as your wheels touch the ground, what do you think you're going to do as the pilot?

263
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 Slam on the brakes.

264
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 What those brakes on?

265
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 Absolutely incorrect.

266
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 You put on the accelerator, rev the shit out of that, and go as fast as you can.

267
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 What?

268
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 Because the reason you do this is that it's so likely that something will go wrong that all you're doing is the pilot is preparing to take off again.

269
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 Of that aircraft carrier in the event that something goes wrong.

270
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 And the only thing that slows you down is you've got this hook, a tail hook that's hanging off the back of your plane as you're landing.

271
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 And then you've got these kind of wires that are sort of made of steel and they're attached to our hydraulic motor.

272
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 They absorb the kinetic energy.

273
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 So it's sort of like getting an elastic band to fly your plane into.

274
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 And that stops the plane fast enough that it doesn't go flying off the end of the aircraft carrier.

275
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 But so often they don't hook onto these wires that all you're supposed to do is as a pilot, as you land on the aircraft carrier, is go right, foot down, ready to lift off again.

276
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 That's amazing.

277
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 That's cool, isn't it?

278
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Yeah.

279
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Was it on QI?

280
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 I can't remember, years and years ago, the idea that one of the first planes, the way that it landed on an aircraft carrier,

281
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 is that the people on the aircraft carrier actually pulled it down from the sky?

282
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 I feel that might have come from the Dunstrive, the Big Book of Thoughts, actually.

283
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 No, I think there's a method here.

284
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 I think there's something.

285
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 Yeah, I don't think it's exactly that.

286
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 I think it was a really early Wright Brothers style thing, possibly.

287
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 Yeah, the Wright Brothers did use catapults sometimes as well.

288
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 Yeah, the first ever planes, a catapult.

289
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 Yeah, certainly the first one that did a full circuit was sent up by catapults.

290
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 So it's very cool.

291
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 It's very cool.

292
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 Oh, can I tell you one extraordinary fact as well?

293
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 This is the fact that it really took me over the edge, is that when you are landing on an aircraft carrier, some aircraft carrier,

294
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 so specifically the Navy's E2 Hawkeye, avoid that if possible, the margin of error as you're landing is one foot.

295
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 So if you are one foot too early in your landing, you smash into the back of the aircraft carrier,

296
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 and if you're one foot too late, you go crashing off the end of the into the sea.

297
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 Oh, my God.

298
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 This is why I'm scared of flying because every pilot has this kind of cowboy attitude where you just die at any moment.

299
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 I flew out from Salzburg, right?

300
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 If you ever go to Salzburg Airport, you're looking at the runway.

301
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 And I was looking at it going, "Oh, that's really interesting.

302
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 I'm sure we're not taking off in this path because there's a ginormous mountain cliff face at the other end."

303
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 And we started going that direction.

304
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 And there was a pilot sitting next to me who was just flying back as a passenger.

305
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 And I was like, "What happens if we don't get enough height?"

306
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 And he said, "We'll go straight into the mountain."

307
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 And I was like, "So why would you build it like that so that that's a possible thing?"

308
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 And he went, "Just don't hit the mountain mate."

309
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 That shouldn't be a thing.

310
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 I mean, I got a flight from Paro, I think it's Paro Airport, which is in Bhutan.

311
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 And that one, you go, it's quite a short takeoff, and then right in front of you there's a mountain.

312
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 And so what he does, he goes down towards the mountain and the last second he banks.

313
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 And then he turns around and there's another mountain.

314
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 And then he has to do another bank away from that mountain because it's in the Himalayas.

315
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 And there's nowhere that isn't mountains.

316
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 And there's only a few qualified pilots who are allowed to do that right to fly into there.

317
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 Just landing on aircraft carriers, taking off from aircraft carriers.

318
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 So do you guys know about Eric Winkle Brown?

319
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 He flew in his life at 487 different types of aircraft.

320
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 And that's more than anyone else ever has done.

321
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 It's more than anyone else ever will do, almost certainly.

322
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 And he had loads of firsts.

323
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 And he just sort of, he was the first to land a jet aircraft on an aircraft carrier.

324
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 He interrogated senior Nazis after the war.

325
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 He crashed 11 times and he said he often survived because he was short.

326
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 He could tuck up his legs in the cockpit rather than having his legs shield off.

327
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 Wow.

328
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 Yeah, it's happened to a lot.

329
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 Yeah, yeah.

330
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 He did a motorbike wall of death with a lion cub.

331
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 What?

332
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 What?

333
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 Don't say that cow's you like it's a thing.

334
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 Yeah.

335
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 There was a very linear job.

336
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 You're going to go in there.

337
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 He got a new sports car at the age of 95.

338
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 He was amazing.

339
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 No, no, no, no.

340
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 Hang on.

341
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 Yeah.

342
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 The motorbike wall of death.

343
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 I think the lion cub was in a side car.

344
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 Sorry.

345
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 I crossed that out as your question.

346
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 He's a clarifying on with his CV.

347
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 Yeah.

348
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 Okay, this is one other thing about him which I find completely unbelievable.

349
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 He flew in the battle of Britain.

350
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 That was the time that he was flying a lot.

351
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 He flew in a biplane in the battle of Britain against planes which were not biplanes.

352
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 They were really good planes.

353
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 But when they launched the V1, the flying bomb, he found that he overtook really close to them

354
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 in a particular kind of plane called a tempest 5.

355
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 And he would clip the wings of the flying bomb with his own wings

356
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 and send them plunging harmlessly into the English Channel.

357
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 What?

358
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 Wow.

359
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 He's lucky that stuff worked because otherwise you've just described Mr. Bean.

360
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 My God.

361
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 You're going to get a lion cub in my entire car.

362
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 Oh, I'm going to hollow.

363
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 That's amazing.

364
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 Well, it was amazing guy.

365
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 And he passed away just, it was this year, wasn't it?

366
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 Or was it last year?

367
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 It was this January of February.

368
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 Right, incredible guy.

369
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 Time for fact number three.

370
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 And that is my fact.

371
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 My fact is that Apple used to give an annual award to the employee who bested up to Steve Jobs.

372
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 So you didn't fully know about it.

373
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 I'm sure.

374
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 But he, I found this fact out by the way in the movie Steve Jobs, the Michael Fastbender movie that came out.

375
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 And if you've seen that movie, you'll know from the portrayal of him that he was an incredibly difficult guy.

376
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 That he was always yelling, that he was always angry, that he had no time for employees that weren't doing things right.

377
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 So the idea was that sometime in the course of his time at Apple occasionally a few people would step up and say no.

378
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 And if other people saw that, they'd be like, oh my God.

379
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 And then they'd give all of the annual award and say you stood up and you get this award.

380
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 Great.

381
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 Yeah.

382
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 You obviously fired Steve Jobs as well to take something away with you.

383
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 Interestingly, those people who stood up to him, most of them were promoted because he actually loved the idea of people standing up to him.

384
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 But then why did not everyone just do it all the time?

385
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 Well, I guess you needed a, you needed to be passionate about the thing that you were talking about.

386
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 So his personal secretary, it was the person who won, won in 1981 and 1982.

387
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 We don't know the examples that won it for her, but we do have a few quotes of what she was like with him.

388
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 And she used to say stuff like, I'm going to take a knife and stab it into his heart.

389
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 Wait, wait, wait, is that a poo knife or is that a normal knife?

390
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 She also threatened to pour her coffee into his lap if he didn't buck up.

391
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 So is that kind of stuff?

392
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 She was really forced on the ear.

393
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 And he would listen to her.

394
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 She was there for his whole career.

395
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 Joanna Hoffman was her name.

396
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 Yeah.

397
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 There was a fact doing the rounds about Apple recently and about aircraft carriers.

398
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 So I thought this is a combo fact, which is that Apple's, the amount of cash Apple has in the bank.

399
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 If they wanted to spend that, they could buy 40 aircraft carriers.

400
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 Wow.

401
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 Although they wouldn't have any planes to put on them because they'd spend all their money on 40 aircraft carriers.

402
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 But if they just bought like 39.

403
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 They could have a load of planes as well.

404
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 Yeah.

405
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 Yeah.

406
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 That's what I would do.

407
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 Well, they don't call you James' strategy hawk in my life.

408
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 James' wife, Helena, actually told us a really cool fact, which is that.

409
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 So like you're saying, aircraft carriers, if you've spent it all, that's all you could afford.

410
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 Super yachts, when people buy super yachts, it costs so much money when they get it built.

411
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 That it ended up going way further than what they thought they could afford.

412
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 And the thing with super yachts is that there's a helipad at the top.

413
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 It got to the point where people couldn't afford helicopters.

414
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 So there's a company that builds the shell of a helicopter that sits on super yachts to give the impression

415
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 that, whoa, they've even got a helicopter.

416
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 Yeah.

417
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 And they're all fake.

418
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 What if there's a fire on the yacht?

419
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 Someone says, "Don't worry, he's got a helicopter."

420
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 Jump in the water.

421
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 Like, "I've got solution to a shipping of fire."

422
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 Jump into the water.

423
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 You're not a long-term thinker then, that's your problem.

424
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 I would say, though, it is a better solution than jumping into the fake helicopter.

425
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 He can't be that much of a twat.

426
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 I'm sure it's a real one.

427
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 I would think about really good employees.

428
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 Amazing employees.

429
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 So, Sandy.

430
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 This is someone in 2013 in America who was working at Duncan Donuts, the Donuts shop.

431
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 And I think she won't, maybe she didn't win an award, but she certainly deserved to.

432
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 So she foiled a robbery by throwing a pot of hot coffee at a robber who was trying to climb in through the cashier's window.

433
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 And then, as the robber fled, she shouted the company's slogan after him.

434
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 What's the slogan?

435
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 The slogan is, "America runs on Duncan."

436
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 And she shouted, "Go run on Duncan."

437
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 I have some things on employees who were fired for things.

438
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 Okay, so, Jack Hoover apparently used to fire people because their heads were too small.

439
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 That's why they took to wearing enormous hats.

440
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 Well, it was kind of a status thing he thought that people with bigger heads were smarter.

441
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 He said he was an notoriously horrible boss, wasn't he, Jack Hoover?

442
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 Yes, he was, yeah.

443
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 Yeah, so first head of the FBI.

444
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 And yeah, there's a couple of stories about him.

445
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 He once found a poo on his patio and he became convinced that he was being stalked by wild animals.

446
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 So, the priority that day was he got all of his top dog FBI employees to get this poo taken off to the lab

447
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 and analyze it to see what kind of creature it belonged to.

448
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 They sent it to the Smithsonian, you know, the biological research, the aspect of it, and identified it as raccoon poo.

449
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 And so, this word got back to Jack Hoover and he built a trap to destroy that raccoon.

450
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 And the next morning the neighbor's cat was spread all over the wall of the house, according to his assistant.

451
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 What was this trap?

452
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 It was a catapult.

453
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 The good thing is that they managed to turn the poo into a wonderful set of six teaspoons.

454
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 So, that's something.

455
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 There was someone, there was a chap in India who, he was an electrical engineer and he was fired.

456
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 His name is AK Verma and he was fired for not turning up for work for 24 years.

457
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 Oh, yeah.

458
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 He was some people.

459
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 I know.

460
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 Just the smallest little thing.

461
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 This is the amazing thing about it.

462
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 Okay, he was sacked in January 2015, right?

463
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 He had gone on leave in 1990.

464
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 And in 1992 they said, we better start investigating where Mr Verma is.

465
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 Formal proceedings only started in 2007.

466
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 And it took another seven years to fire him.

467
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 There was someone in America, it was also in 2013 who was sacked after he just outsourced his entire job to China.

468
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 He was a software engineer.

469
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 Oh, wow.

470
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 And he just paid them 20% of his big salary and let them get on with it and just did nothing.

471
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 And the sentence on the report about it said, the software developer, in his 40s,

472
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 is thought to have spent his work days watching cat videos on YouTube and browsing Reddit.

473
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 So, he was a QI researcher.

474
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 We should move on to our final first.

475
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 Yes, yes.

476
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is James Harkin.

477
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 Okay, my fact this week is that there are Japanese rock bands called Abingden Boy School,

478
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 mass of the fermenting drinks and seagull screaming kiss her, kiss her.

479
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 Very good names.

480
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 That is good.

481
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 I just found a list of Japanese rock bands on Wikipedia and they were my three favourites.

482
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 Abingden Boy School, they were originally called ABS and they were named after an anti-lock breaking system.

483
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 And then they back formated their name, they looked on Wikipedia for other things with ABS as the initialism and they found that.

484
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 And it is where Radiohead were founded apparently, that school.

485
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 The seagull band are named after a track by the 80s band XTC.

486
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 And the Dregs band, they asked what that meant and they said it doesn't have any particular meaning.

487
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 We just lined up a few words that we liked.

488
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 Cool.

489
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 Mass of the fermenting Dregs.

490
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 I think that's probably also true of a couple of other bands, Macdonald Duck Eclare and School Food Punishment.

491
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 I imagine they're just like names that sound nice in Japanese and they decided to go for it.

492
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 Wait, so these in Japanese, their names are they in English?

493
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 Very English, yes.

494
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 But they're kind of, they're a little bit transliterative so they're not exactly as we would say about pretty much the same.

495
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 Speaking Macdonalds, I saw a band the other day that is both a Macdonalds Tribute Act as well as a Black Sabbath Tribute Act.

496
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 And they're called Mac Sabbath and they come out dressed as hamburger and Ronald McDonalds.

497
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 And they, yeah, it's really fun, this video footage online and then they're really cool band.

498
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 All the songs are just changed to be McDonald's themed.

499
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 That's really good.

500
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 Yeah.

501
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 Well, I just love about this fact.

502
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 I've said this a few times actually.

503
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 I just love going on the internet and finding lists of stuff and then finding bits and pieces for it.

504
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 Yeah.

505
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 And the other day I found the most recent name, most recent list of baby names in the UK, these are from 2014.

506
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 And there are 10 girls in that year called Pebbles.

507
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 There were three boys whose name was name.

508
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 Wow.

509
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 That's going to stay on the form.

510
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 Yeah.

511
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 That's going to stay on the form.

512
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 And there were 31 girls called ISIS in 2014.

513
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 Wow.

514
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 Do you have a 14?

515
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 I mean, it only really kicked off halfway through 2014.

516
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 Oh, you think that's what it was?

517
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 I hope that's what it was.

518
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 And there were three girls called Bowie and five boys called Bowie.

519
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 So it's kind of a mixed gender name.

520
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 Oh, that's really nice.

521
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 Yeah.

522
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 My favorite fact about David Bowie's name is that he was originally called David Jones.

523
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 So that was his birth name.

524
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 And he started becoming a musician.

525
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 And then suddenly I don't know where David Jones of the monkeys suddenly became massively famous.

526
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 So he thought, oh, I can't use that name.

527
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 So he changed it to David Bowie.

528
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 But however, before he changed it to David Bowie, he named himself Tom Jones.

529
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 And then a few weeks later this new singer kicked off.

530
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 And he was like, oh, Jesus.

531
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 And so then he went to David Bowie.

532
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 So David Bowie was called Tom Jones and David Jones before he was David Bowie.

533
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 Do you think there's another universe where David were Tom Jones?

534
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 Our Tom Jones didn't become famous.

535
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 Or did become famous under the name David Bowie.

536
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 Our David Bowie became famous under the name Tom Jones.

537
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 If it is, it's a magical universe.

538
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 I wish we were all there right now.

539
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 It's almost impossible to conceive.

540
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 All right.

541
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 I've got some Japanese pop music facts.

542
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 Great.

543
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 Well, I've got a couple more bands which I'm surprised it didn't make your list change.

544
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 So there's the sex machine guns.

545
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 Very cool.

546
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 Very good.

547
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 And my favorite is the, as in the Shakespearean for you, the Michelle Gunn Elephant.

548
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 That's just brilliant.

549
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 Do you know where they got their name?

550
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 Right.

551
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 So they misheard a song by The Damned, which is machine gun etiquette.

552
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 And they thought it was Michelle Gunn Elephant.

553
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 Oh.

554
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 That's very cool.

555
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 That's very cool.

556
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 Very cool.

557
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 So this thing you're talking about where in Japan, English words are taken and they're sort of repurposed.

558
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 There's something called a gyrogo.

559
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 That is the Japanese rendering of English words that have now fallen into common parlance in Japan.

560
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 So for instance, Japanese words that are used now are Myku, which is the microphone at Super, which is supermarket.

561
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 And I really like this one.

562
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 A Beku is a word for a romantic couple, like a couple in a relationship.

563
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 And that comes from the French Avec.

564
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 And that's just become a Japanese word that means a romantic couple.

565
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 I thought you were going to say it was from Posh and Bex.

566
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 No, it's much more sophisticated than that.

567
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 They're more high-brow than you are.

568
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 Well, I wouldn't say that Posh and Bex are not sophisticated.

569
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 I think he's got a tattoo of Victoria's name, Victoria Beckham's name in Sanskrit, but it's misspelled.

570
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 Yeah.

571
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 You're right, that is sophisticated.

572
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 So the biggest selling song in Japanese history, not including digital downloads.

573
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 So it's a bit of an older one.

574
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 But this is genuinely the best selling song in Japanese history.

575
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 It's called a yogei taiyaki kun, which translates as swim.

576
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 You see, bream-shaped pancake.

577
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 That's true.

578
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 Apparently, it was used in a children's TV show.

579
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 And then it became massively popular for people to buy for kids.

580
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 There is a band called Machikado Keki Japan, whose name means street corner economic conditions.

581
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 Right.

582
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 And they're debut single. They're quite a recent band.

583
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 It mentions quantitative easing and construction bonds.

584
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 And the big gimmick of this band, they're a girl band.

585
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 And they promised that the length of their skirts would correlate with the country's stock market conditions.

586
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 So that when the Nikae, the Japanese stock market was doing well, then many skirts would get shorter.

587
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 And when they was doing badly, they would go down towards the ankles.

588
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 That's actually a real thing, isn't it?

589
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 That people do use the length of people's skirts to say whether the country's doing well or badly.

590
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 Hemline index, that's what it's called.

591
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 Yeah, that's right.

592
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 And in really good economic conditions, we're all going to tend to wear shorter skirts.

593
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 Yeah.

594
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 Which is strange, because you'd think that in bad economic conditions, you'd be wearing shorter skirts because you have to save cloth.

595
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 Yeah, you would think that.

596
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 Yeah.

597
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 That's true, yeah.

598
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 Whereas in the good times, there's cloth going.

599
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 Because I was reading a lot of lists on Wikipedia, like I do for my job.

600
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 I found one list, which is lists of nicknames used by George W. Bush, which was quite good.

601
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 So Tony Blair, he called him Lanslide.

602
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 I think because he had such a really good kind of election one year.

603
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 Oh, no, you'd think that.

604
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 No, Tony Blair delights in causing Lanslide.

605
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 That's the funny thing.

606
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 They keep it out of the papers.

607
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 The director of the CIA Counterterrorist Centre, Cole Fa Black, was known as Flies on the Eyeball's Guy by George W. Bush.

608
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 And Vladimir Putin was known as Poo-Tee-Poo-T-Ostrich Legs.

609
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 I can see that with Putin, though.

610
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 Yeah, can you?

611
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 He's got a sort of big strong arms and stuff, but you never get his legs out.

612
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 What's he hiding?

613
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts.

614
