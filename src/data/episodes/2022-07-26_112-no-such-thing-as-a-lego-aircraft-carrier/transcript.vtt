00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 [Bell]

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 Hello and welcome to another episode.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 And no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 This week coming to you from Edinburgh.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 My name is Dan Schreiber. Please welcome to the stage.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 It's Anichesinski, Jane Tarkin and Andy Murray.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 [Cheering]

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 [Cheering]

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 [Cheering]

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 [Cheering]

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 from the last seven days and in a particular order. Here we go.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 Starting with you, Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 My fact this week is that Antarctica exports used toilet paper.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 [Laughter]

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 Who wants it? I see why they want to get rid of it.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 I want to know who wants it at the other end.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 Well, it's not so much that anyone else wants it.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 [Laughter]

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 So there are loads of different research bases in Antarctica.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 They used to do very bad things.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 They used to just dump it into the sea.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 And that can obviously be very bad or introduces foreign microorganisms

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 which can then have knock on effects on the whole ecosystem.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 So some people incinerate it now.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 But there are companies which do tourism to Antarctica

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 and they export feces and urine and usually paper.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 Hang on, so that's part of the holiday you sign up to

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 as you go to watch them picking up used toilet paper.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 [Laughter]

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 It's not a big part of the itinerary.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 But if you are doing an expedition to the pole or outside a research base

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 you basically have to carry your own poo behind you on the sled.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 Wow! Yeah!

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 But the good thing is it freezes, so it's better.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 Right? It's not the most silver of life.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 Do you guys remember that story?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 Just speaking of it freezing, a poo freezing.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 There was a story told by an explorer called Wade Davis,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 a big anthropologist, amazing guy.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 And he was talking about a guy who I can't remember where exactly he lived.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 But there was a lot of ice.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 And he refused to move.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 There were people trying to say you should move out of here

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 and he said I don't want to move out of here.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 So what he ended up doing was building up weapons

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 that he could use against them.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 And what he did was he made a poo knife.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 So he froze his poo and he positioned it in its shape

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 to be knife-like. And when it froze he had a dagger.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 And it was for attacking people not for eating with.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 Well, it probably doubled up to be honest.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 Did he ever get to wield it?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 Quite a weird story. He ended up saying that he had to give you huskies

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 and he said he eventually escaped the place.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 And what he did was he had to have a sled.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 So he killed one of his huskies with the poo knife.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 He then ate the food of the dog in order to survive.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 Then he crafted the inside bones of the ribcage into a small sled

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 and he tucked his poo knife into his belt.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 And he rode off into the distance.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 This is made up.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 I promise you, this is a dream.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 I promise you, wave David, screw it with.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 Wave David's poo knife.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 You would...

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 I reckon if you Googled just poo knife.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 It's not maybe there's like a hundred different things.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 It's like I'm going to have to know all this stuff.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 So when Shackleton went to the South Pole,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 they ran out of toilet paper very quickly.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 But what they did have was two full editions of the Encyclopedia Britannica.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 Yeah.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 And so when it got desperate, that's what they used.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 They used it for also for smoking tobacco, as well as for toilet paper.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 But Dr. Alexander Maclin, who was a surgeon, tore out the entry on scurvy

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 because he didn't want anyone wiping with it.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 Because he thought it was really, really important.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 Really?

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 And there was a physicist there called Reginald James,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 who saved the section on geometry.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 Right.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 What if we get to the pole and there's a test?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 I think books have been used through the centuries, haven't they?

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 As you'd imagine, really, because toilet paper wasn't invented

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 relatively recently.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 And so, yeah, the ability would use pages of books to wipe their arses with.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 I think a popular thing that people used as lurel in America was corn on the cob

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 until toilet paper was invented.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 Isn't it the case with corn on the cob that it's one of those foods that actually comes out as corn still on the other side?

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 So you'd be wiping it and you're just putting it back on

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 to the thing you just ate.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 So there's an almanac called the Farmers Almanac,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 which still exists today, I think.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 From 1818, the Farmers Almanac in America came with a hole punched in the top left-hand corner, I think.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 And that was because it was known that people would use it once they'd read it or made read it or whatever.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 They'd pin it to their wall and they'd use it as lurel.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 And so it came with a hole pre-punched in it so that they could buy it into the world.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 That's really interesting.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 We write books for QI.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 And when we did a fact book, we got a request from the Netherlands and they said we want to put a hole in the top corner.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 They said it was for the shower.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 So they could read it in the shower, but that never made sense to me.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 No one reads in the shower.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 No, they don't, do they?

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 But they do write the buns with things.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 Yeah.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 So the world's most expensive toilet paper is £825,000 a roll.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 Okay.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 It's personally delivered to you with a bottle of champagne.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 And as you use it, 24-karat gold flakes will fall to the floor and you're behind taking you to another level of sophistication.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 That's according to their website.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 They've only managed to make one roll at the moment and I don't think they've actually sold it.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 But if you've got £800,000 a spare?

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 Saddam Hussein had a solid gold toilet roll holder, actually, didn't he?

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 I was actually speaking of world leaders.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 I was looking into what Obama has.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 I thought the White House must have some interesting toilet paper.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 And actually, and they do.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 But it's not incredible.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 It's just got the presidential seal on a bunch of toilet paper.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 Really that's disrespectful.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 Yeah, you'd think actually.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 Yeah.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 So I was thinking about the Pope as well.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 I thought what does he use?

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 He uses the doves.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 I know this.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 It just has a whole box of doves in the loop.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 That's lovely.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 I've got a fact about the Antarctic.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 But I feel we've...

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 No, let's go back.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 I was just going to say about the Pope.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 We know a bit about the toilet paper.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 Not in his actual paper in the Vatican, but he has a summer house.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 And we know about it because my lean class, the single stole a roll of the toilet paper.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 She hands it out as Christmas presents now.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 She collects weird things from around the world.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 Let's go back to the Arctic.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 Sounds like hearsay to me.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 Oh!

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 See, niche early 2000s reference that.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 Yeah.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 Sorry, Andy, go on.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 How can I follow that?

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 So there's a thing...

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 They have a holiday in the Antarctic.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 People are staying there, called Midwinter Day.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 And I got this from an interview with a woman who'd been living there for eight years,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 called Kerry Nelson.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 And she said, "It feels like a real holiday."

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 And people actually send e-greeting cars to each other from other stations,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 saying things like, "Happy Midwinter, come stop by our station for dinner."

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 Which nobody can, because we're also isolated.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 So it's kind of a joke.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 Sounds like the worst holiday ever.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 I know, and they're so isolated.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 You can't get to another station most of the year.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 And they're so far apart from each other, because it is massive.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 So one thing they have had, they have darts tournaments over the phone.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 Where you throw a dart, tell the other person what you've scored.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 And then they throw a dart and they tell you.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 I might be wrong about this, but something in the back of my head says they're in the...

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 So it's in the 20s or 30s.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 They used to have darts on the radio.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 And what they would do is you'd get a professional darts player who'd throw his score.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 And then they would say, he got, let's say, 180 or whatever.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 And then they'd have a gap of complete silence while you threw your darts.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 And then they'd, after about 30 seconds, then he'd throw another three.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 That did happen, didn't it?

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 Yeah, that did happen.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 That's not what cricket's done, which has worked out during those bits, you have to have someone actually talking nonsense.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 Yeah.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 You can't just leave silence.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 Well, cricket doesn't leave a gap for you to take your own...

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 ...and for you to have an over.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 Should we move on to our next round?

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 Yeah, let's do that.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anitzynski.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 Yeah, my fact is that planes are launched off aircraft carriers by catapult.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 So they're catapulted off aircraft carriers?

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 So these are when we see those massive aircraft carriers, and you've only got that tiny runway,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 and they suddenly just gain momentum really quickly.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 There were always much too short for planes to gain the right amount of speed,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 necessarily for them to take off.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 So they just go crashing into the sea if they just used what planes normally use, which is their own acceleration.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 So yeah, they've got these catapult set up, and they call them catapults, and they're controlled by a catapult officer,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 the coolest dog in the world, who sits in the catapult control pod.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 If you're looking up, look up an aircraft carrier, you've got the floor of the ship,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 and then the catapult control pod is just this transparent disc that pops up in the floor,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 and he sits with his head just above floor level, so he's at the level of...

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 ...his heads at the level of the plane's wheels.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 And yet how it works is that it's by a system of pistons, so the planes sitting there,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 and it's got these two cylinders attached to it, and these cylinders are about as long as the football pitch.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 And there are pistons in the cylinders, and the catapult officer builds up all the lots of pressure behind the pistons.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 And at the moment the plane needs to take off, he releases all of that pressure, and so of course the pistons are released,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 and the force of that catapults the plane into the air, hopefully.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 And it is the most terrifying thing I've ever read about.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 The cool thing about these pistons is that they're steam powered.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 It's a weird thing, the fighter jet is being launched by steam power, but that's what the pistons are full of.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 The steam that's generated by the ship.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 They're trying to make new ones out there that are like electoral magnets, and they'll use those instead,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 and they're going to be much better because you need fewer people to work them,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 and also you won't have to have massive steam pipes going on the side of your ship there,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 because sometimes blow up.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 Right.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 Yeah, they do. It's very dangerous. Things seem to blow up all the time on aircraft carriers, and people recently someone who was working on one of the US Navy's aircraft carriers,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 I think, got sucked into the jet engine, as he was walking across the boat, and he was rescued actually before he got sucked into the propellant.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 I think he got stuck. I haven't had to watch the footage.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 Thank God he was wearing his enormous hat.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 The new electromagnetic ones, so the normal launch, the normal catapult that we have at the moment for aircraft carriers,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 they accelerate the plane from no miles an hour to 165 miles an hour in two seconds.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 Wow.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 And the new ones, they're going to be able to launch a plane every 45 seconds from a ship with this electromagnetic thing,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 and while it's happening, it's using the same amount of electricity as a town.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 What?

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 Yeah, that's amazing.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 And it's very short. It's only three seconds that is using it, but it's exactly the same electricity consumption as a town.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 Wow.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 Wow.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 I was reading about, because I was looking at pictures of the aircraft carriers, and they're ginormous, and I was trying to work out how big they actually are.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 So the largest aircraft carrier that we have, if you took it out of the water and you flipped it up vertically, it would be taller.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 This is the USS Enterprise, it would be taller than the Eiffel Tower.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 Wow.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 Yeah, in its verticalness.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 Now, that's not even the biggest boat on Earth, right?

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 So just to give you those, to give you the numbers of this, the longest boat on Earth, which is an oil tanker, is 458 meters long.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 If you flip that up on its side, that's taller than the Empire State Building.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 Wow.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 Yeah.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 A boat is taller than the Empire State Building.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 The biggest boats in the world are so big they can't get through the English Channel.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 What?

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 I know, it's...

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 Did you read it in Dan's Book of Thoughts?

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 No, and it is...

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 No.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 And it turns out it is true, because it's the depth, it's not the width.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 Oh, that's the cheesy.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 Oh, no, it is like they displace so much water that they actually can't fit through, because it's too shallow.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 Wow.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 Do you know how many parts there are in the largest aircraft carriers?

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 This is the U.S. Nimitz class, which is part of the lace as well.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 They have a billion individual pieces.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 Wow.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 A billion.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 That's a billion things that can go wrong.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 Yeah.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 And they're put together like Lego.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 It's so cool.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 They make two or four-year-olds.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 And if you tread on one at least, it hurts so much.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 So another incredible thing that everyone has to know about is how landing happens on aircraft carriers.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
 So, in fact, question for you guys.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 If you were landing an airplane on an aircraft carrier and you know you have to stop as soon as possible,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 as soon as your wheels touch the ground, what do you think you're going to do as the pilot?

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 Slam on the brakes.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 What those brakes on?

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 Absolutely incorrect.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 You put on the accelerator, rev the shit out of that, and go as fast as you can.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 What?

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 Because the reason you do this is that it's so likely that something will go wrong that all you're doing is the pilot is preparing to take off again.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 Of that aircraft carrier in the event that something goes wrong.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 And the only thing that slows you down is you've got this hook, a tail hook that's hanging off the back of your plane as you're landing.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 And then you've got these kind of wires that are sort of made of steel and they're attached to our hydraulic motor.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 They absorb the kinetic energy.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 So it's sort of like getting an elastic band to fly your plane into.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 And that stops the plane fast enough that it doesn't go flying off the end of the aircraft carrier.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 But so often they don't hook onto these wires that all you're supposed to do is as a pilot, as you land on the aircraft carrier, is go right, foot down, ready to lift off again.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 That's amazing.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 That's cool, isn't it?

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 Yeah.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 Was it on QI?

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 I can't remember, years and years ago, the idea that one of the first planes, the way that it landed on an aircraft carrier,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 is that the people on the aircraft carrier actually pulled it down from the sky?

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 I feel that might have come from the Dunstrive, the Big Book of Thoughts, actually.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 No, I think there's a method here.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 I think there's something.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 Yeah, I don't think it's exactly that.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 I think it was a really early Wright Brothers style thing, possibly.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 Yeah, the Wright Brothers did use catapults sometimes as well.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 Yeah, the first ever planes, a catapult.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 Yeah, certainly the first one that did a full circuit was sent up by catapults.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 So it's very cool.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 It's very cool.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 Oh, can I tell you one extraordinary fact as well?

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 This is the fact that it really took me over the edge, is that when you are landing on an aircraft carrier, some aircraft carrier,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 so specifically the Navy's E2 Hawkeye, avoid that if possible, the margin of error as you're landing is one foot.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 So if you are one foot too early in your landing, you smash into the back of the aircraft carrier,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 and if you're one foot too late, you go crashing off the end of the into the sea.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 Oh, my God.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 This is why I'm scared of flying because every pilot has this kind of cowboy attitude where you just die at any moment.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 I flew out from Salzburg, right?

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 If you ever go to Salzburg Airport, you're looking at the runway.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 And I was looking at it going, "Oh, that's really interesting.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 I'm sure we're not taking off in this path because there's a ginormous mountain cliff face at the other end."

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 And we started going that direction.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 And there was a pilot sitting next to me who was just flying back as a passenger.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 And I was like, "What happens if we don't get enough height?"

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 And he said, "We'll go straight into the mountain."

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 And I was like, "So why would you build it like that so that that's a possible thing?"

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 And he went, "Just don't hit the mountain mate."

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 That shouldn't be a thing.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 I mean, I got a flight from Paro, I think it's Paro Airport, which is in Bhutan.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 And that one, you go, it's quite a short takeoff, and then right in front of you there's a mountain.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 And so what he does, he goes down towards the mountain and the last second he banks.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 And then he turns around and there's another mountain.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 And then he has to do another bank away from that mountain because it's in the Himalayas.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 And there's nowhere that isn't mountains.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 And there's only a few qualified pilots who are allowed to do that right to fly into there.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 Just landing on aircraft carriers, taking off from aircraft carriers.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 So do you guys know about Eric Winkle Brown?

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 He flew in his life at 487 different types of aircraft.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 And that's more than anyone else ever has done.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 It's more than anyone else ever will do, almost certainly.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 And he had loads of firsts.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 And he just sort of, he was the first to land a jet aircraft on an aircraft carrier.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 He interrogated senior Nazis after the war.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 He crashed 11 times and he said he often survived because he was short.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 He could tuck up his legs in the cockpit rather than having his legs shield off.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 Wow.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 Yeah, it's happened to a lot.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 He did a motorbike wall of death with a lion cub.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 What?

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 What?

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 Don't say that cow's you like it's a thing.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 Yeah.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 There was a very linear job.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 You're going to go in there.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 He got a new sports car at the age of 95.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 He was amazing.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 No, no, no, no.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 Hang on.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 Yeah.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 The motorbike wall of death.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 I think the lion cub was in a side car.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 Sorry.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 I crossed that out as your question.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 He's a clarifying on with his CV.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 Yeah.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 Okay, this is one other thing about him which I find completely unbelievable.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 He flew in the battle of Britain.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 That was the time that he was flying a lot.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 He flew in a biplane in the battle of Britain against planes which were not biplanes.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 They were really good planes.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 But when they launched the V1, the flying bomb, he found that he overtook really close to them

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 in a particular kind of plane called a tempest 5.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 And he would clip the wings of the flying bomb with his own wings

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 and send them plunging harmlessly into the English Channel.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 What?

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 Wow.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 He's lucky that stuff worked because otherwise you've just described Mr. Bean.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 My God.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 You're going to get a lion cub in my entire car.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 Oh, I'm going to hollow.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 That's amazing.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 Well, it was amazing guy.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 And he passed away just, it was this year, wasn't it?

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 Or was it last year?

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 It was this January of February.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 Right, incredible guy.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 Time for fact number three.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 And that is my fact.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 My fact is that Apple used to give an annual award to the employee who bested up to Steve Jobs.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 So you didn't fully know about it.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 I'm sure.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 But he, I found this fact out by the way in the movie Steve Jobs, the Michael Fastbender movie that came out.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 And if you've seen that movie, you'll know from the portrayal of him that he was an incredibly difficult guy.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 That he was always yelling, that he was always angry, that he had no time for employees that weren't doing things right.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 So the idea was that sometime in the course of his time at Apple occasionally a few people would step up and say no.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 And if other people saw that, they'd be like, oh my God.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 And then they'd give all of the annual award and say you stood up and you get this award.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 Great.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 Yeah.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 You obviously fired Steve Jobs as well to take something away with you.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 Interestingly, those people who stood up to him, most of them were promoted because he actually loved the idea of people standing up to him.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 But then why did not everyone just do it all the time?

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 Well, I guess you needed a, you needed to be passionate about the thing that you were talking about.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 So his personal secretary, it was the person who won, won in 1981 and 1982.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 We don't know the examples that won it for her, but we do have a few quotes of what she was like with him.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 And she used to say stuff like, I'm going to take a knife and stab it into his heart.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 Wait, wait, wait, is that a poo knife or is that a normal knife?

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 She also threatened to pour her coffee into his lap if he didn't buck up.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 So is that kind of stuff?

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 She was really forced on the ear.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 And he would listen to her.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 She was there for his whole career.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 Joanna Hoffman was her name.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 Yeah.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 There was a fact doing the rounds about Apple recently and about aircraft carriers.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 So I thought this is a combo fact, which is that Apple's, the amount of cash Apple has in the bank.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 If they wanted to spend that, they could buy 40 aircraft carriers.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 Wow.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 Although they wouldn't have any planes to put on them because they'd spend all their money on 40 aircraft carriers.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 But if they just bought like 39.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 They could have a load of planes as well.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 Yeah.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 Yeah.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 That's what I would do.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 Well, they don't call you James' strategy hawk in my life.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000
 James' wife, Helena, actually told us a really cool fact, which is that.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 So like you're saying, aircraft carriers, if you've spent it all, that's all you could afford.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 Super yachts, when people buy super yachts, it costs so much money when they get it built.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 That it ended up going way further than what they thought they could afford.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 And the thing with super yachts is that there's a helipad at the top.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 It got to the point where people couldn't afford helicopters.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 So there's a company that builds the shell of a helicopter that sits on super yachts to give the impression

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 that, whoa, they've even got a helicopter.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 Yeah.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 And they're all fake.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 What if there's a fire on the yacht?

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 Someone says, "Don't worry, he's got a helicopter."

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000
 Jump in the water.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 Like, "I've got solution to a shipping of fire."

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 Jump into the water.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 You're not a long-term thinker then, that's your problem.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 I would say, though, it is a better solution than jumping into the fake helicopter.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 He can't be that much of a twat.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 I'm sure it's a real one.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 I would think about really good employees.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 Amazing employees.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 So, Sandy.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 This is someone in 2013 in America who was working at Duncan Donuts, the Donuts shop.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 And I think she won't, maybe she didn't win an award, but she certainly deserved to.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:31.000
 So she foiled a robbery by throwing a pot of hot coffee at a robber who was trying to climb in through the cashier's window.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 And then, as the robber fled, she shouted the company's slogan after him.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 What's the slogan?

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 The slogan is, "America runs on Duncan."

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 And she shouted, "Go run on Duncan."

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.000
 I have some things on employees who were fired for things.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 Okay, so, Jack Hoover apparently used to fire people because their heads were too small.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 That's why they took to wearing enormous hats.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 Well, it was kind of a status thing he thought that people with bigger heads were smarter.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 He said he was an notoriously horrible boss, wasn't he, Jack Hoover?

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 Yes, he was, yeah.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 Yeah, so first head of the FBI.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 And yeah, there's a couple of stories about him.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 He once found a poo on his patio and he became convinced that he was being stalked by wild animals.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 So, the priority that day was he got all of his top dog FBI employees to get this poo taken off to the lab

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 and analyze it to see what kind of creature it belonged to.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 They sent it to the Smithsonian, you know, the biological research, the aspect of it, and identified it as raccoon poo.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 And so, this word got back to Jack Hoover and he built a trap to destroy that raccoon.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 And the next morning the neighbor's cat was spread all over the wall of the house, according to his assistant.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 What was this trap?

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000
 It was a catapult.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.000
 The good thing is that they managed to turn the poo into a wonderful set of six teaspoons.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 So, that's something.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.000
 There was someone, there was a chap in India who, he was an electrical engineer and he was fired.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 His name is AK Verma and he was fired for not turning up for work for 24 years.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 He was some people.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 I know.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 Just the smallest little thing.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000
 This is the amazing thing about it.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 Okay, he was sacked in January 2015, right?

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 He had gone on leave in 1990.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 And in 1992 they said, we better start investigating where Mr Verma is.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000
 Formal proceedings only started in 2007.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.000
 And it took another seven years to fire him.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 There was someone in America, it was also in 2013 who was sacked after he just outsourced his entire job to China.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 He was a software engineer.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.000
 Oh, wow.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 And he just paid them 20% of his big salary and let them get on with it and just did nothing.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000
 And the sentence on the report about it said, the software developer, in his 40s,

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 is thought to have spent his work days watching cat videos on YouTube and browsing Reddit.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 So, he was a QI researcher.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 We should move on to our final first.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000
 Yes, yes.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is James Harkin.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 Okay, my fact this week is that there are Japanese rock bands called Abingden Boy School,

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 mass of the fermenting drinks and seagull screaming kiss her, kiss her.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 Very good names.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000
 That is good.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 I just found a list of Japanese rock bands on Wikipedia and they were my three favourites.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 Abingden Boy School, they were originally called ABS and they were named after an anti-lock breaking system.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 And then they back formated their name, they looked on Wikipedia for other things with ABS as the initialism and they found that.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 And it is where Radiohead were founded apparently, that school.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 The seagull band are named after a track by the 80s band XTC.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000
 And the Dregs band, they asked what that meant and they said it doesn't have any particular meaning.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 We just lined up a few words that we liked.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 Cool.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 Mass of the fermenting Dregs.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:13.000
 I think that's probably also true of a couple of other bands, Macdonald Duck Eclare and School Food Punishment.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 I imagine they're just like names that sound nice in Japanese and they decided to go for it.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 Wait, so these in Japanese, their names are they in English?

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.000
 Very English, yes.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 But they're kind of, they're a little bit transliterative so they're not exactly as we would say about pretty much the same.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:32.000
 Speaking Macdonalds, I saw a band the other day that is both a Macdonalds Tribute Act as well as a Black Sabbath Tribute Act.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.000
 And they're called Mac Sabbath and they come out dressed as hamburger and Ronald McDonalds.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 And they, yeah, it's really fun, this video footage online and then they're really cool band.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000
 All the songs are just changed to be McDonald's themed.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.000
 That's really good.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.000
 Yeah.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 Well, I just love about this fact.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 I've said this a few times actually.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 I just love going on the internet and finding lists of stuff and then finding bits and pieces for it.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 Yeah.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 And the other day I found the most recent name, most recent list of baby names in the UK, these are from 2014.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 And there are 10 girls in that year called Pebbles.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 There were three boys whose name was name.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 Wow.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 That's going to stay on the form.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 Yeah.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 That's going to stay on the form.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 And there were 31 girls called ISIS in 2014.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.000
 Wow.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.000
 Do you have a 14?

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 I mean, it only really kicked off halfway through 2014.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 Oh, you think that's what it was?

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000
 I hope that's what it was.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 And there were three girls called Bowie and five boys called Bowie.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 So it's kind of a mixed gender name.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.000
 Oh, that's really nice.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000
 Yeah.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.000
 My favorite fact about David Bowie's name is that he was originally called David Jones.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000
 So that was his birth name.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 And he started becoming a musician.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 And then suddenly I don't know where David Jones of the monkeys suddenly became massively famous.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000
 So he thought, oh, I can't use that name.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 So he changed it to David Bowie.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:01.000
 But however, before he changed it to David Bowie, he named himself Tom Jones.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 And then a few weeks later this new singer kicked off.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 And he was like, oh, Jesus.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000
 And so then he went to David Bowie.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 So David Bowie was called Tom Jones and David Jones before he was David Bowie.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 Do you think there's another universe where David were Tom Jones?

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000
 Our Tom Jones didn't become famous.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 Or did become famous under the name David Bowie.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 Our David Bowie became famous under the name Tom Jones.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000
 If it is, it's a magical universe.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 I wish we were all there right now.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 It's almost impossible to conceive.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 All right.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 I've got some Japanese pop music facts.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 Great.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 Well, I've got a couple more bands which I'm surprised it didn't make your list change.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 So there's the sex machine guns.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 Very cool.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 Very good.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 And my favorite is the, as in the Shakespearean for you, the Michelle Gunn Elephant.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000
 That's just brilliant.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 Do you know where they got their name?

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.000
 Right.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 So they misheard a song by The Damned, which is machine gun etiquette.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 And they thought it was Michelle Gunn Elephant.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 Oh.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 That's very cool.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 That's very cool.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 Very cool.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 So this thing you're talking about where in Japan, English words are taken and they're sort of repurposed.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 There's something called a gyrogo.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 That is the Japanese rendering of English words that have now fallen into common parlance in Japan.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 So for instance, Japanese words that are used now are Myku, which is the microphone at Super, which is supermarket.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 And I really like this one.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000
 A Beku is a word for a romantic couple, like a couple in a relationship.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000
 And that comes from the French Avec.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 And that's just become a Japanese word that means a romantic couple.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 I thought you were going to say it was from Posh and Bex.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 No, it's much more sophisticated than that.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000
 They're more high-brow than you are.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000
 Well, I wouldn't say that Posh and Bex are not sophisticated.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 I think he's got a tattoo of Victoria's name, Victoria Beckham's name in Sanskrit, but it's misspelled.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 Yeah.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 You're right, that is sophisticated.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 So the biggest selling song in Japanese history, not including digital downloads.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 So it's a bit of an older one.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 But this is genuinely the best selling song in Japanese history.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 It's called a yogei taiyaki kun, which translates as swim.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 You see, bream-shaped pancake.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000
 That's true.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 Apparently, it was used in a children's TV show.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 And then it became massively popular for people to buy for kids.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:33.000
 There is a band called Machikado Keki Japan, whose name means street corner economic conditions.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 Right.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 And they're debut single. They're quite a recent band.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000
 It mentions quantitative easing and construction bonds.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000
 And the big gimmick of this band, they're a girl band.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.000
 And they promised that the length of their skirts would correlate with the country's stock market conditions.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 So that when the Nikae, the Japanese stock market was doing well, then many skirts would get shorter.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 And when they was doing badly, they would go down towards the ankles.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 That's actually a real thing, isn't it?

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 That people do use the length of people's skirts to say whether the country's doing well or badly.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000
 Hemline index, that's what it's called.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.000
 Yeah, that's right.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000
 And in really good economic conditions, we're all going to tend to wear shorter skirts.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.000
 Yeah.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 Which is strange, because you'd think that in bad economic conditions, you'd be wearing shorter skirts because you have to save cloth.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000
 Yeah, you would think that.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 Yeah.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
 That's true, yeah.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000
 Whereas in the good times, there's cloth going.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000
 Because I was reading a lot of lists on Wikipedia, like I do for my job.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 I found one list, which is lists of nicknames used by George W. Bush, which was quite good.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000
 So Tony Blair, he called him Lanslide.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000
 I think because he had such a really good kind of election one year.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 Oh, no, you'd think that.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000
 No, Tony Blair delights in causing Lanslide.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 That's the funny thing.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 They keep it out of the papers.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 The director of the CIA Counterterrorist Centre, Cole Fa Black, was known as Flies on the Eyeball's Guy by George W. Bush.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 And Vladimir Putin was known as Poo-Tee-Poo-T-Ostrich Legs.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 I can see that with Putin, though.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000
 Yeah, can you?

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 He's got a sort of big strong arms and stuff, but you never get his legs out.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 What's he hiding?

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000
