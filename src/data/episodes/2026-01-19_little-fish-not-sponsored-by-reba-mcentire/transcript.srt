00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Little Fish. We've been so happy to get a

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,520
 message from you guys to say that you've been enjoying this show and we certainly enjoy making it.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:14,000
 There's a little bit more loose, a little bit more silly than the normal shows but we really,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,480
 really love getting your facts so please do keep sending those in. The reason I've

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,840
 disturbed the start of your show today is because I want to tell you about a quiz that we're doing.

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,840
 It is for Patreon subscribers on the top tier and it will take place on the 23rd of January.

7
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:36,240
 It's 7pm UK time so that'll be some time in the afternoon if you're in North America and it'll

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:41,040
 be very early in the morning if you're in Australia or New Zealand but hopefully you will still be

9
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,920
 able to join us. It's going to be a whole load of fun. We've got loads of amazing stuff planned

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:53,520
 for you and if you are not a member of Patreon right now then you have to go to patreon.com/nosichthingsaffish

11
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,480
 and join our top tier. You could probably just do it for a month and then quit if you just want to do

12
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,360
 the quiz but honestly there's so much good stuff on our Patreon that I really think once you join

13
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:09,680
 you will be hooked because we have extra content, we have merch, we have video content, there's

14
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,160
 all sorts of stuff on there. We hope we've made it value for money because people going on there

15
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:20,320
 help to support the podcast so it is a real good mutual benefit thing. Anyway, enough of that

16
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:37,120
 really helped you enjoy this episode of Little Fish.

17
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:43,120
 Hey everyone, welcome to another episode of Little Fish. This is the bonus Monday episode where we

18
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:49,120
 put down our facts and we focus exclusively on your favourite facts from the last seven days.

19
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,360
 We have been going through the inbox, we've got a bunch of amazing things to read out to you today

20
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,200
 so why don't we get into it? Who's going to start? I've got one. Put my hand up there.

21
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,600
 Because we're recording on Zoom, you should say. I put my hand up because we're recording on Zoom but

22
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,320
 I feel like I might have done it even in the room with you guys. Yeah, that's true. I do every other

23
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:15,520
 week. Right, here's a fact from Owen Bergstein. In 2023, how many full-sized corn mazes were there

24
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,640
 in the United States that were shaped like Reba McIntyre's face?

25
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:28,640
 Okay, well first question. What is a corn ma- now? Who is Reba McIntyre? She's an unbelievably

26
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:35,520
 famous person who I'd never heard of. She's a country singer. I know Reba. She's a big deal.

27
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:42,480
 Two years. How's her name in America, I would say? The Queen of Country. She sold 75 million

28
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,960
 records. I've never heard of her until this email from Owen dropped it to the inbox.

29
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,040
 I mean, what level of fame are you in America that there are more than one corn mazes?

30
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,000
 You're assuming there's more than one. You're going straight in. I'm going straight in.

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,160
 Imagine if the answer's zero. What a quiz that would be. The riddler has checked it again.

32
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:12,320
 Okay, corn mazes. And obviously if she's a country singer, it feels like she's going to be

33
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:18,960
 popular in corn country. Good point. I'm going to say three. Okay, nice. I'm a high ball in it,

34
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:27,680
 I feel. That's 36. 36. Yeah. Well, Owen goes on. Did you say six? Ten? Did one of you

35
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,840
 ruin the game and say something like a hundred? Probably. Well, he's a listener at least.

36
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:44,880
 Well, the real answer is 25 plus another 15 that say her name. So there are 40 full size

37
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:49,840
 Reaper McIntyre corn mazes in the USA. And what's the reason?

38
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:57,280
 I was astonishing. Well, she has a face which is very good for corn mazes. She has these wrinkles

39
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:03,360
 on her forehead. They're in the exact shape of a spiral. She's getting on a bit, but I should say

40
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,200
 she's an incredibly beautiful and distinguished lady with no wrinkles on her forehead. What's

41
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:13,280
 the next? And I just say you can be beautiful and have wrinkles. Oh, okay. Oh, we've got into body

42
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,880
 positivity. Corn it. You're absolutely right. You're absolutely right. She looks exactly like an

43
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:23,840
 ear of corn. You know what? I've been to the world's biggest maze. It's in Hawaii. And it's in the

44
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:32,720
 dull plantation where they make pineapples. And I went in it. And someone has basically made a hole

45
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,600
 in all the hedges. So you can just get to the middle by walking through the holes.

46
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:45,760
 A hole plantation. Do you say the dull plantation? I see what you do there. Yeah, very nice.

47
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:51,520
 I had to break out of the maze a few years ago. There's one in Crystal Palace and I was with

48
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:57,680
 Finella. And she suddenly got terrified that a murderer might be in there. And sort of got like

49
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,840
 weird claustrophobia. She was like, this is exactly where you would get murdered. So we had to

50
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,120
 break out of this maze. But it happened to be on the edge of the maze. And we went into this

51
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,760
 weird random forest. And we were lost for like half an hour where it is so much more likely. I've

52
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,480
 done that maze, Dan. It's about four feet high. It's not. Please. This is not me saying that I

53
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,880
 think that I'm just reporting on what happened. Listen, I just got to tell you one or two other things.

54
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,720
 Owen says because the email is so good. Yeah. So yeah, it's that there are about 500 corn mazes in

55
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:34,480
 the USA. So eight percent of US corn mazes roughly were Reaper McIntyre themed. He also adds the

56
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:42,720
 mazes appear in 23 states. The 23rd state joined the union in 1820. So in 1819, somebody could have

57
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,920
 remarked to someone else in just over two centuries, more American states will have Reaper McIntyre themed

58
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:56,240
 corn mazes that currently exist. How time to change? Hey, that says PS. I am not sponsored by Reaper

59
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:04,560
 McIntyre. I find her music annoying. Oh, there you go. That's amazing. I shall I do another

60
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:11,440
 fact? Yeah, you're jumping. This one is from Andrew Law Vassa. And Andrew says that the 2000 movie

61
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:19,200
 Cruel Intentions 2, which sounds like Dan would love it, is a cut down of a TV adaptation turn

62
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:26,160
 sequel to Cruel Intentions, which was adapted from dangerous liaisons, a film adapted from a Broadway

63
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:33,600
 play that was itself an adaptation from an 18th century French novel. And it was produced by a company

64
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:42,800
 called Original Film. Brilliant. Brilliant. That's. There you go. Would you like another one?

65
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:50,000
 Yeah, go on. This is from Dennis Rump, who says I would love to hear Andy try to pronounce my last

66
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,480
 name. Hint is German. So I think it's Dennis Rump. Bad luck, Dennis, because Andy actually speaks a bit

67
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:04,480
 of German, don't you Andy? I'm Bissien. Yes. This is a cool. Yeah. This is a cool fact about

68
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:10,960
 planes. It's brilliant. So you know, you have those turbines on an airline's jet engine.

69
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,440
 You know, the airline jet engine has all these blades, right? On going round and round and round.

70
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:22,880
 Well, Dennis says the centropetal force, which is the swirling round force, on each turbine blade

71
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,840
 of an airline as jet engine is roughly equal to the weight of two double decker buses.

72
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:35,360
 To, I know, it's crazy. And to overcome this stress, which is obviously enormous, each blade

73
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:44,960
 on those turbines is made of a single crystal of an alloy. Isn't that okay? Yeah, what's the

74
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,640
 way you said it? Yeah. Crystal is a word that's very easy to say at a mystical fashion, isn't it?

75
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,160
 Yeah, single crystal of an alloy. I don't really quite understand what that means.

76
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,280
 Is it an elliptical? Is it like if you were a someone who robbed banks for or jewelry shops,

77
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,400
 is there like a fine crystal just sitting at the centre? It's not a crystal in the sense that

78
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:10,240
 you were describing it. It's metal. It's not a crystal in the sense of Indiana Jones or the

79
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,520
 crystal skull. Exactly. So glad to come, it's a real, it's a real cineasts dream this episode,

80
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:21,760
 isn't it? True intentions to Indiana Jones for. But basically, the blades, they have to cope with

81
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:27,040
 these huge stresses and forces. And if you have one crystal, it's one part is the point. So there

82
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:32,480
 were no, what they call grain boundaries in the blade, which makes it a lot stronger. One of the

83
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:38,240
 best quibbles that we ever had on QI was when we did a question about these turbines.

84
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:45,440
 And we said that Rolls-Royce engines are tested by throwing frozen chickens or frozen turkeys

85
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,800
 into the blades to make sure that they don't break, which I think is true or at least it was true.

86
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:58,720
 And we put a picture of one of these turbines up on the screen. Actually, it was a video, some VT,

87
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:04,640
 and someone wrote in saying that couldn't possibly be a Rolls-Royce engine because Rolls-Royce engines

88
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:10,400
 go in a clockwise direction, and that was going in an anticlockwise direction. Or vice versa. I can't

89
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:15,200
 know what it was. And what had actually happened was we had used it, but we just flipped the footage.

90
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:21,680
 Oh wow. Brilliant spot. What a spot. Yeah, it was an amazing spot. It's a brilliant quibble.

91
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:27,920
 Lovely. All right, James. Okay, here is the fact from Peter Bloom. And Peter says,

92
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:34,880
 "While in prison, Clyde Barrow of Bonnie and Clyde fame, amputated two of his toes to get out of

93
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:43,440
 hard labor six days later, he was unexpectedly pardoned." Lovely. So slightly, well, he got out

94
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,400
 of six days of hard labor. Yeah, I've never looked into those guys. I just know. What do you know about

95
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,920
 them, don't you? Just know it as the movie. I know it's the Bonnie and Clyde movie. I know it as a

96
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:59,280
 Serge Gainesburg song. Bunny. It's a beautiful French moment in that song. Do you know what they

97
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:06,400
 what they did? Like what crimes they did? Then they were shot. Well, shot up. Interestingly,

98
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:12,960
 they very rarely rob banks. And in fact, whether they ever did or not, I'm not sure, because banks

99
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:19,360
 are quite hard to rob, right? Because they have a lot of security. I definitely Clyde did rob a few

100
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,160
 banks, but usually when he did it, he did it with another associate called Raymond Hamilton,

101
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:30,880
 and Bonnie often drove the getaway car. And I think like Raymond and Clyde doesn't have the same ring.

102
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:37,680
 It's called a sexy. And so they might have done one or two banks, but mostly they would rob like

103
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,000
 convenient stores and gas stations and stuff like that, whether it's not as much security, and you can

104
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,040
 just get the money out of the town. That's less sexy as well. That's extremely unsexy. Now that we know

105
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,480
 it. I would say Clyde and his friend Raymond basically sticking up an Aldi at the side of a road.

106
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,440
 It doesn't work. The searchgainesburg song would have been less sexy as well.

107
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:04,800
 That's great. That's great. That's great extra intel. Well, I got a little sort of crime adjacent

108
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:10,720
 fact here that's been sent in by Alex Hartley. People are more likely to give their seat to a pregnant

109
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:20,080
 woman when Batman is present now. I buy it. So this was reported in nature and the idea was a female

110
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:26,800
 experimenter came on appearing pregnant. She boarded the train with an observer and then they watched

111
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:32,400
 if anyone stood up to give her a seat. Now an additional person dressed as Batman would then

112
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:39,360
 enter from another door. And as soon as Batman was in the room, they noticed that 67% stood up

113
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:46,400
 versus 37% when Batman wasn't there. Interestingly, 44% of the people who offered their seat claimed

114
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:52,560
 that they did not see Batman before offering the seat. Right. So can I ask something down? Is this

115
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:59,280
 to do with seeing a pregnant woman and thinking, oh, I won't bother? And then Batman gets on who

116
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:04,560
 reminds me of values of justice? Or is it just that the presence of a Batman costume on a train

117
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,800
 is weird enough that you look around and then you notice, oh, there's a pregnant woman here.

118
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,160
 Oh, that's the good thing. Because everyone's looking at their phones and the people that

119
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,960
 people are not paying attention. I'm not sure the answer to that. But I think that's something

120
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:23,600
 that absolutely are less difficult superheroes. Not in this one. This is a very specific Batman

121
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:29,840
 experiment. Spider-Man might have a different result. Yeah, but they didn't have access to the Marvel

122
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:36,640
 Universe's copyright. So if it was Captain Marvel or Wonder Woman or someone, you might see that

123
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:44,560
 superhero and think, well, women are much stronger than me. So I deserve the seat. Yes. I think Batman's

124
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:51,120
 been used quite often in studies, hasn't it? Do you remember that study that if you dress children

125
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,320
 like Batman, they do better at school or something? Yeah. What? Remember that? Well, they can afford the

126
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,640
 private education, can't they? Because they're absolutely loaded. Yeah. What is it? What's the day

127
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:06,080
 every day at the school? What's going on? I think it was something like that. It just made the kids

128
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:10,160
 more confident of something. Well, there was also that thing which I think was done on QI,

129
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:16,000
 which is how I know it, of the Superman pose. I don't know if that was the bunk thing right. Andy,

130
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,040
 do you have another effect? I've got a fact, which relates to something we said recently on the

131
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:28,800
 show actually. This is from Catherine Radmer. I'll just read you the fact. Noted French composer,

132
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:36,800
 Camille Sasson, I want to say. Yeah, who wrote the who are Cantina theme in a previous episode? Exactly.

133
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:45,360
 Is credited with composing the first documented film score. No way. This was in 1908 and he seems

134
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,400
 to be the first famous person to have written a score for a film and it was a specific score for a

135
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:55,840
 specific new film. So I think that's what qualified as the first. It was called the assassination of

136
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:01,520
 the Duke of Gees and it was 15 minutes long, which was epic at the time. That was like Lord of the

137
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:07,360
 Rings avatar. That was a biggie. Do you think you need an intermission halfway through? Oh, definitely.

138
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:20,800
 Yeah. Sorry. Too much. Basting for a piss. Seven minutes in.

139
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:28,240
 Yeah, okay, I've got one more. We mentioned Tim Hortons, the donut chain a few weeks. Well,

140
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,200
 actually quite a few weeks ago now. This coffee shop in Canada. Because we were saying that in

141
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:39,760
 Canada, they eat more donuts than in America. But the column Smith wrote to us and said,

142
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:46,560
 "Did you be noticed that it has no apostrophe and this is because the apostrophe is illegal in Quebec?"

143
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:58,080
 Yeah. And it's because the apostrophe S is English grammar and they're trying to keep the French

144
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:05,040
 language alive. And so they say that, you know, you're not allowed to do it. And apparently Canadians

145
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,880
 in that area are very upset about it. Half of them are very happy with it. Does it have to be called

146
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:19,040
 Le Horton de Tim or something? No, it's just Tim Hortons just with NS. How far would the authorities

147
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,960
 push this if the rules were being breached? Like, are we talking police activity?

148
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:28,880
 Honestly, I think it would depend on the political climate at the time, as so many of these things do.

149
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:36,160
 Very wise. You know, if you want to stop people selling glitters instead of pites or vice versa,

150
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,360
 those things the police tend to get involved just before a local election.

151
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:46,160
 So James, are you saying Tim Hortons is a Canadian company, therefore, it has to do those rules,

152
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,360
 or is that for all companies? Like McDonald's. I wonder if McDonald's. I don't think McDonald's

153
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:59,600
 has to change all of its paperwork just when it's in Canada. So German doesn't use apostrophes.

154
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,280
 We were talking earlier about how Andy speaks a bit of German, but people in German do sometimes

155
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:11,920
 use apostrophes and it's known in German as the idiots apostrophe. That's unkind. Why?

156
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,440
 Because it's like someone who's not using the German language correctly and is sort of

157
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:23,200
 appropriating the English language instead. And a bit like how we take the piss out of people if

158
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,760
 they put the apostrophe in the wrong place. If you're like a, you know, a gross as or something,

159
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:33,360
 we call it the grossest apostrophe. True, you're right. They call incorrect or correct in English,

160
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,720
 but they call it idiots apostrophe. Very strong. Very strong. Harsh but fair. Yeah. Well, that's

161
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:46,560
 the Germans. For some of history. Well, those are brilliant facts. Thank you so much everyone

162
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,920
 for sending them in. If you want your fact read out on the show podcast at qi.com, send them there

163
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:57,360
 and he goes through them all and he sends them out to us and we love chatting them through. So yeah,

164
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:03,280
 more please. But we got one more thing to do before we wrap up, which is we have some new custodians

165
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:09,680
 who need some facts. Dishing out. So if you are a member of the club fish highest tier, which is

166
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:16,800
 friend of the podcast, you immediately get assigned one of the facts, the headline facts from the archive

167
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:21,760
 of no such thing as a fish. So we're going to read out some now. So Andy, why don't we start with you?

168
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:28,240
 Yes. Here's one. This goes out to Missy Brown. Congratulations, Missy. Your fact in perpetuity

169
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:35,600
 to look after and care for is that the first ever made in Germany labels were intended to put people

170
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:44,080
 off buying products made in Germany. It's because it's this old law. I think it was the 19th century. And

171
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:50,400
 I think maybe Germany didn't have quite the reputation for really high quality, precision,

172
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,840
 manufacturing, all this that it did now. People were worried about Sheffield, huge metal working city,

173
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,240
 Sheffield cutlery industry, all of that. They were worried about cheap German knockoffs. And so

174
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,080
 this was a law that said, if you're a foreign company in the UK, you have to put a label on saying

175
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:09,680
 made in Germany and therefore worse. I'd like to see some more fun in the labels like made at sea.

176
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:15,360
 Oh yeah. Made in space. Is that on your fish? Yeah. He's mad on.

177
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:24,400
 Made with love. That's lovely. Do you remember that was what was it? What other smoothies called?

178
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,360
 Innocent. Innocent. Was it? Was it true that they said once I might be getting this mixed up

179
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:36,000
 with another company, but they said made with love in one of their items. And they weren't allowed

180
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,480
 to put it because it wasn't. It's very, you know, the rules of what you put on labels are very

181
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:46,960
 strict. And if you say it's made with love, there has to be actual actual what actual what the only

182
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,360
 one I remember is the Welsh dragon sausages, which had to put a little disclaimer on the saying

183
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:57,040
 not does not contain dragon. They should have just found some Komodo dragon. You were just

184
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:02,400
 bought a tiny little bit in each one. Yeah. Where was your business prey that the side of James?

185
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:08,240
 I had contact the other day with, you know, I've been taking lion's mane mushroom

186
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,840
 little, little juicy injections. Yeah, all right. Joe Rogan.

187
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:19,200
 Well, they made locally in Margate where I live and a friend of mine had a bottle and she bought it

188
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,600
 last summer and she said, I don't know when the use by date is. And so I was like, oh, I'll just ask

189
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,640
 the person online. And they said, basically, if we were allowed to, we would put use by end

190
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:34,320
 of universe because it's it's fine forever. Because it doesn't work. No, but I'm when you take

191
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:41,040
 care. It's like, who says it works? Who says it works? It's all about placebo. Absolutely.

192
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:50,320
 Fair enough. Okay. Here is a fact for Leah M. Leah, your fact is that in 1991, a professor at

193
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:56,720
 Iowa State University suggested we could solve almost every problem by blowing up the moon.

194
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:02,960
 Wow. I do not recall this fact. That is one of yours. Can you remember what problems it was

195
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:12,080
 solved? Global warming, the production problems on cruel intentions three. There was a lot. I think

196
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:18,000
 this was one of those comments. And the professor has passed away since where I think the family

197
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:24,000
 was sort of like, oh, it was it was a common in passing. And, you know, it's been amplified as

198
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,600
 like his main things. You've got to be so careful with your words, yes, scientist. Let's let's do

199
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:36,400
 another one. This one is for Lily Kemp. This is a James Harken fact. And it's from episode 21,

200
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,080
 by the way, if anyone wants to go back and listen to all of these facts in their full glory.

201
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:49,680
 The fact is in New York City until 1925, drivers going east west, stopped on amber and drove on green,

202
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:57,520
 and drivers going north south, stopped on green and drove on amber. Great. Amazing. But it's

203
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,080
 easy to tell if you're going east west or north south, especially in New York, right? Because it's

204
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:10,080
 such a grid system. But I think like probably for people who aren't native New Yorkers,

205
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,400
 you might not always know which direction you're going in. That's very true. That's very true. One

206
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:20,800
 my secondary proposal is to paint N or E or S or W on every single road, every two meters.

207
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:27,680
 So I think that'll help. Okay. All right. I'll do one. Go for it. This one goes out to Molly

208
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:33,920
 McAnerney. Hello, Molly. This is one of my facts, actually, and it's that there are companies

209
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:40,320
 which lasso icebergs to stop them hitting oil rigs. It's like an iron number when you came up when

210
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:45,680
 you loved this fact. I'm so happy. And I found, because they're quite secretive, the firms that do it,

211
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:51,280
 because it's quite a, I don't know, specialist job or they have their own techniques for, it's mostly

212
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,360
 predicting where they're going to end up, the icebergs, you know, that's the secret bit. The actual

213
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,640
 lasso is just driving around it with a rope and then hauling it for a bit. But I found someone who

214
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,680
 worked one of these companies and had a chat with him and done. That's right. Yeah. It feels like for

215
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:10,800
 the greater good, we shouldn't be making secret where icebergs are going to end up. That should be

216
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,080
 public knowledge. For the really great of good, I think we should let them hit the oil rigs.

217
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,840
 And get all that oil into the ocean. No.

218
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:25,840
 Yes. It has to take on that. Let's end this shit show. Let's accelerate it.

219
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:31,280
 Well, that's very good. But that's one of my old-time fights. I'd love that one.

220
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,760
 Yeah, that was an early classic. And I remember I think it was one of the very first ones where we had

221
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:42,560
 contact with someone with a very obscure job. There was always exciting research moments where we

222
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:47,440
 could get in contact with people actually in the field doing it. James, do you want to read out

223
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:55,440
 this? This is your one. Yeah, I can do. In 1903, a man called W. Reginald Bray posted himself.

224
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:03,760
 And that fact has now been delivered to someone called. And I don't think this is the real name,

225
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:12,800
 but apologies if it is. Mr. Retro Graveyard. Yes. That's a name. Sorry, Mr. Graveyard. Can I call you

226
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:19,120
 Retro? Perhaps if that is your real name. But yeah, that's your fact. W. Reginald Bray posting himself.

227
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,680
 He was always doing that, wasn't he? The only memory I have, and it might not be connected to this

228
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:28,320
 specific guy, but someone posted themselves, I think, to Australia in a box that was put in an

229
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:34,160
 airplane. And it was successful. And so someone else tried to replicate it. And they were tightly packed

230
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:39,840
 in. And unfortunately, as they were packed in, the box went over and he spent the entire trip

231
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:49,840
 upside down in the box. And that's where the this way up stickers. I've just looked up W. Reginald Bray.

232
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:57,600
 He's also known as the autograph king and collected 15,000. Oh, yes. And Dan, very excitingly,

233
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:03,440
 was born in Forest Hill, London, which is about a five minute walk from where you used to live.

234
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,400
 He was born there in 1879. Just listen to this sentence. He lived there until 1938 when he moved to

235
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:15,120
 Croydon. He died on the 6th of June, 1939. A great advert for the Croydon way of life. I was hoping

236
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:24,320
 you would say he died when he was murdered in the local Crystal Palace maze. That was a very

237
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:31,360
 cool. All right, let's get another fact. And this goes out to Tristan Street. And your fact is

238
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:37,840
 that the world's oldest edible ham just celebrated its 112th birthday.

239
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,400
 Gorgeous. Now, it'll be much older now, the ham, because we did this years ago.

240
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,000
 Fair. It might have been decommissioned. Was this the one that was hanging out in the cover market?

241
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,800
 Which I had seen. I had seen as well, because I used to live in Oxford. In fact, the first time

242
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:58,800
 I ever joined QI was part of there was a QI building in Oxford. And James, you were trying to open

243
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:10,320
 your cannon and ball gelatiria. Don't know why that didn't work. We had a QI building there,

244
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,040
 and there was the covered market, and there's a shop in there, a butchers, and hanging in the

245
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:20,240
 window is supposedly the world's oldest ham. Yeah, and do you think it's no longer there? Do you?

246
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,960
 No, I think now the title has passed to Sir Ian McKellen.

247
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,600
 Yeah, but no, I fear it might not be there anymore. Right. I hope it is. Do you think someone might

248
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:37,200
 have eaten it? I don't think it was one of those ham's, which just if it was at a buffet, you'd definitely

249
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:44,080
 eat around it. Can you imagine seeing that in the possibility? Because it looks like a,

250
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:49,280
 it looks like a sort of a bit long buried limb that's been dug up. It really does, yeah.

251
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:55,360
 But I think like ham is, the ham doesn't really go off. It's like lion's male mushrooms in that respect.

252
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:02,720
 Oh, it looks like someone's posted saying it was on display a couple of years ago in the cover

253
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,600
 market. So maybe it lives. Okay. Maybe it lives. It feels like a school trip for us. Yeah,

254
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:13,520
 I'll definitely, we should start doing that. All right. Well, congratulations. Tristan,

255
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:19,680
 next fact, Andy, do you want to read this one out? Yes, this goes out to Sarah. You know who you are,

256
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:27,040
 and it's that orangutans like playing on iPads, but gorillas don't. This is an experiment that was done

257
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:33,600
 in 2013 and they gave orangutans iPads and they, they bloody loved it. And I think they started calling

258
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,760
 each other. And there was this rash of experiments when the iPad was quite new. It was more of an

259
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:43,680
 experiment on scientists with access to iPads than it was on these animals, basically. But I think they

260
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:48,320
 would, they would chat and they would put up on the screen, you know, a banana. So would you like a

261
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,160
 banana that it would tap the banana that they give them a banana? So this is quite a good

262
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:58,640
 racket, actually, because the iPad would have been fairly fresh around 2015 when we were doing this.

263
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,880
 If you were a scientist and you wanted all the latest tech for free, you would request it and say

264
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,120
 it's part of a gorilla experiment. And you would let the gorilla play on it for five minutes and

265
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:12,160
 then bring it home. I'd rather feel like after gorillas played with your iPad for five minutes,

266
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:18,160
 it might not be quite as usable as you hope. Yeah, you're right, James. Yeah. All right, let's get one

267
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:25,600
 more. James, do you want to read this one? Okay, this one is for Susie and your fact, it's an

268
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:33,200
 absolutely classic. I really love this fact. The 1888 encyclopedia Britannica entry for whales reads

269
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:41,200
 C England. And in that moment, Welsh nationalism was born afresh. I really hope, I really hope it's

270
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:51,280
 not Susie from Canaver. But yeah, the reason was that the article England was actually England and

271
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:56,960
 whales. I think it's because at the time, legally, legally, I'm saying, legally, not culturally,

272
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:02,800
 they might have been one territory. There's all that there was all this chat about the principality,

273
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:07,280
 that kind of thing. Whereas I think Scotland was differently established as a different nation,

274
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:12,960
 basically. Yeah, but why do you have the England and whales cricket team? Do you? They always call it

275
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:18,800
 England cricket team, but it's the England and Wales. I had never heard that. Yeah. And that's why

276
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:24,480
 they're so good. Well, most of them come from South Africa or New Zealand or whatever. But yeah,

277
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,080
 like that, they are officially known as that. Wait, you're not allowed to have Africans on the

278
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:33,200
 England grid team, are you? Well, Kevin Peterson was born in South Africa, one of our best ever players.

279
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,240
 The England cricket team over the last couple of years has been to Yorkshiremen, one

280
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:45,120
 like Castrian, and then people from sorted places around the world. Have they become citizens of the UK

281
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,760
 in order to do that? Yeah, you would have to be- Yeah, you have to be legally- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

282
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,840
 But is that why we've been winning so hard all around the world, as I understand it?

283
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:59,280
 Well, and, fortunately, this is going out after the accident is just finished. But before that,

284
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:05,200
 yeah, good. Good. All right. Well, look, congrats, everyone. We really hope you enjoy your facts.
