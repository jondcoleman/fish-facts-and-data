WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 One welcome to another episode and no such thing as a fish.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.440
 We have a very exciting day ahead of us.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.800
 We are on our way to the studio to record the very first episode of no such thing as the

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.800
 news.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:18.440
 It's our BBC 2 TV show and it's going to air May 20th at 11.05 pm on BBC 2.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.000
 So we need you guys to watch it.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 We really need you to watch it because if you don't watch it, they'll cancel us.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 We will lose the entire series.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.600
 So please, if you like our show, if you're hearing this now, cancel your Friday night plans

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.800
 and come to the TV, sit down, make yourself some tea and watch our show.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.280
 We'd really appreciate it and please spread the word.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.200
 If you want to watch it on I Player a little bit later, that is also okay with us.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.520
 Just watch it at some point and you can go to the no such thing as a fish YouTube channel

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.360
 and catch it there anytime from Sunday morning.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.080
 The episode you're about to hear now is the on-ed pilot which we recorded last week.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.080
 So enjoy.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:17.000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as the news coming to you from

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.600
 up the Crete Comby Club in Greenwich London.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.800
 My name is Dan Schreiber and please welcome it's Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:33.200
 James Harkin.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.720
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our favourite facts from

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.000
 the last seven days of news and in no particular order, here we go, starting with you, Chazinski.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.120
 My fact this week is that the first thing that Ted Cruz did after dropping it out of the

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.400
 Republican contest was Elba's wife in the face.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.640
 And this was so you probably saw that about a week ago, Ted Cruz dropped out the Republican

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:05.400
 race leaving Donald Trump as the only contender for the throne of America.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.240
 And yeah, it's just a great YouTube clip.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.240
 You should watch it.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.880
 He makes this speech in Indiana saying he's very sorry but he seems to have not gone that

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:12.880
 well for him.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.880
 He turns away from the microphone.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.360
 Elba's his wife in the face as he's hugging his dad and then he sort of tries to compensate

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.920
 for it by then trying to do a three-way hug with his dad and his wife and then sort of

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.560
 slaps her about a bit as he goes back to do that.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.880
 And that was just seemed like an awkward end to an awkward campaign.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.120
 I think he's got a very unfortunate time, Ted Cruz.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:40.760
 First of all, Donald Trump made a reference to JFK's killing and accused Cruz at some point

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.880
 of having done in a photo with Lee Harvey Oswald to release.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.880
 I don't know.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.880
 I don't know.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:46.880
 He was far, sorry.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.640
 He's just far though of being a photo of Lee Harvey Oswald.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.640
 Yeah.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.880
 So he's the spawn of the murderer.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.840
 And then everyone in America seems to think that he is the zodiac killer.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.080
 Even though his first murder was committed two years before Cruz was born.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.680
 I find it like there was, he had a non-line story that had lots of odd products.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.240
 If you were trying to eventually run for president, you wouldn't naturally have.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.600
 There was this one debate that he had with Donald Trump where he started telling Donald Trump

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.600
 to breathe.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.600
 And Trump was like, "Well, you breathe.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.600
 I'm breathing.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.600
 Why can't you breathe?"

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.600
 And he was like, "Oh, I'm breathing.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.600
 Why don't you breathe?"

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.360
 They just had this real kind of like, breathe-off kind of conversation.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.040
 And then Rubio comes in and he's like, "When you guys are done doing yoga."

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.200
 And it's like these weird calls.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.160
 And then so, Ted Cruz, then a few days later, for 35 bucks on his website, you could buy

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:42.400
 the Ted Cruz Breathe Exercise Matt that you would just learn to breathe better on.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.880
 So he was just running with these gangs and then he got sued by a company who are a yoga

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.720
 company who are called Breathe saying you can't suddenly start selling Breathe Yoga Matt on

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.720
 your website.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.900
 So he had to take the whole Breathe thing away.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.880
 So then he just was selling Exercise Matt, you know?

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.880
 Just for no reason, it's just why not get an Exercise Matt of mine?

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.920
 It's the whole joke, I guess we're now selling Exercise Matt.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:14.600
 So it looks now it's going to be Trump versus Clinton, right, in the American presidential

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.600
 race.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.920
 And it means it's going to be the most unpopular presidential candidates in my lifetime,

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:26.120
 versus the second most popular candidate in my lifetime, and by a long, long way as well.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.120
 Yeah.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.320
 I think PJ walked, tweeted a couple of days ago that this came out in support for Hillary

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.560
 and it was a story and the tweet was everyone vote for Hillary, it's the second worst thing

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.000
 that could possibly happen to the world.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.840
 There was a poll this week by the public policy poll and they like tested how popular Donald

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.200
 Trump is compared to various different things and it turned out that he is less popular than

00:04:52.200 --> 00:05:04.920
 the traffic jams, used car salesmen, hipsters, jury duty, the band's nickel back, root canal

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.040
 surgery and lice.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.800
 There's another on Ted Cruz's website, there's another product that he sold, which is a thing

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.720
 that he started, a kind of what he was trying to guess to be a kind of meme going round,

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.560
 which is about, he called it Trump or Tantrum.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.560
 So the idea is, every time Donald Trump was throwing a tantrum, he was like, it's a Trump

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.640
 or a tantrum and I looked at just the basic words and you think, why didn't you just call

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.560
 it a tantrum?

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.920
 And I don't trust someone who doesn't recognise a good pun.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.920
 So...

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.160
 Do you know how to tell if he's angry actually?

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.160
 Donald Trump.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.160
 Yeah.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.160
 No.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.720
 He, as I'm talking about, he starts building walls, he wears a red hat when he's angry.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:48.280
 This is according to his butler, who I think wrote a book a couple of months ago, a few

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.400
 months ago and said that the way to tell his mood is by the colour of hat that he's wearing

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:57.280
 and when he's pissed off, he wears a red hat and that is when to leave Iran.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.880
 So there's a fit, this is the American elections.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.320
 We have the British local elections this week.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.600
 I was a few funny, amusing things that happened there.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.560
 In Wolverhampton, the Conservative Party accidentally put two people up for elections, so they

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.360
 came first and third.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.360
 Welcome.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.160
 Yeah, but the thing is, they took votes off each other.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.400
 So one of them said no, no vote for him, vote for him but people didn't really pay any attention.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:28.120
 And if the guy who came third got just 60 more votes, then Labour would have gotten.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:33.560
 And also, there's election going on in the Philippines at the moment with the most unbelievably

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:41.040
 weird man who's just wanted and his campaign slogan is basically I will kill all the criminals.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:51.280
 Well, do we go Duterte or Duterte, or the Punisher, as they call it.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.520
 It is Duterte, I think, because his nickname and his old job was Duterte Harry.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.760
 Oh, see, that is a good pun.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.000
 Ted Cruz could learn something up there.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.560
 And that's how he got into power.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:08.320
 In an interview, many are asking what my credentials are and what I can do for the Philippines.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.560
 They're telling me that they have heard I will womanize her.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.560
 That is true.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.560
 That is very true.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.360
 He said, well, in a press conference, he just said that.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:25.840
 He's point, he's voted about his multiple affairs and the fact he uses a lot of my anger

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:26.840
 to keep himself going.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.640
 He's voted about his my anger use.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.920
 Yeah, it's very confident, isn't it?

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:37.880
 You wait till you see the pills I have to take to sustain this.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:45.280
 He's got an advertising contact with his side, but yeah, he's reassured the public after

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:49.920
 boasting that all his affairs, that his mistresses won't cost the public a lot because he keeps

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:56.240
 them in sheen boarding house and he takes up to short stay hotels for sex.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.720
 He's quite a character.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:02.520
 He's like one of these strong men, kind of presidents, that kind of coming in around the

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.520
 world.

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.520
 I think he's one of those kind of guys.

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:05.520
 Right.

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.120
 We need to move on to our final facts soon.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.960
 So anyone got anything before we do?

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.160
 Can I just quickly relate one thing about the recent UK election?

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.160
 Yeah.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:19.600
 In case you missed it, there was a Labour counsellor called Duncan N. Wright and he wanted

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:24.640
 to be the counsellor for Whitney in the West Oxfordshire area and he sent a tweet out after

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:29.680
 the elections just saying, lost by 70 votes or so, thanks for the opportunity to serve.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:35.080
 The fight goes on and then about 20 minutes later he sent another tweet saying, actually,

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:38.000
 it turns out I won, fondle of my votes under a Tory pile.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 Thanks, Whitney.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.920
 And they just, that's how casual voting is in this country.

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:47.080
 Oh, we found a bunch more votes under this pile of paper.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.080
 Sorry.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.400
 The fight can stop immediately.

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.400
 All right.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.400
 So there we have it.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.320
 Ted Cruz, accidentally, elbows his wife in the face.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:01.440
 Now we are moving on to our second fact of the show and that is my fact.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:06.960
 My fact this week is that this week scientists have discovered that we still haven't discovered

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:11.920
 99.99% of life on Earth.

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:12.920
 That's a lot.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:18.200
 Now, the big story that was in the news this week about this is that there's an estimate

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:22.440
 of how much life on Earth there is and it changes all the time, but it's quite manageable

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.760
 in a way for counting purposes.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:30.400
 So in 2011, they thought there was about 8.7 million different forms of life on the planet.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.520
 They just found out through this new study that they reckoned that that number has gone

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:42.120
 up from 8.7 million to one trillion, one trillion, what are these things that we haven't?

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.120
 They found it.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:48.160
 There's a lot of sports to be had.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.520
 Is it very, very small things that we haven't?

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.520
 Yeah, it's microbes.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.520
 It's microbes.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:57.520
 What they did is there's a way of kind of working things out called scaling laws and say

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:03.100
 you know how big an animal is, you can kind of tell what its metabolism is and if the

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:06.280
 bigger it is, the more it is, so you can put the size of the animal in it and you can work

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.280
 out its metabolism.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:11.560
 That's an example of things and another way of doing this is you can work out how many big

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:16.440
 animals there are in an area and then by putting them into an equation, you can work out

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:20.880
 how many microbes or how many small animals there are as well and so they've worked out how

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.200
 many big animals they think there are and they've put it into the scaling equation and

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.960
 they've come out with one trillion.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:30.280
 We just don't know, I mean they are making this up, I think.

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:31.280
 That's true.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.560
 They said that there's between 100 billion and 1 trillion.

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:40.440
 So that is actually quite a large gap between those two numbers if you think about it.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.480
 Don't think about it, just let me know.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.480
 It is amazing.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:48.360
 The difference between a billion and a trillion is it's a number that I'm unable properly

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.880
 to understand.

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:51.360
 So I started thinking about it.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:55.080
 I first thought, okay, everyone always has this dream of having a species named after

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.080
 them.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:59.640
 So I thought, well, if there's a trillion surely there's enough for us all, right, to go around.

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:00.640
 So I looked into it.

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:01.640
 And more than enough.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:02.640
 Yeah, exactly.

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:06.200
 So I looked into how many people have existed on earth ever, all the dead people, all the

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:11.840
 living people combined and apparently according to the population reference of euro, they estimate

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:18.360
 that about 107 billion people have ever existed, which means that's a bit less than a trillion

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.400
 so we could do it.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:24.560
 And that's really, that's insane, the differentiation of life on our planet.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.040
 Yeah, but most of those people don't want some crappy bit of bacteria named after them.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:32.120
 They want a large mammal, a large, ambitious mammal.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.240
 That's what's so disappointing about this.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.240
 You hear this fact?

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:38.720
 You're like brilliant lions everywhere, different species of lions.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.640
 Oh good, it's tiny microbes again.

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:43.360
 They're probably really interesting.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:48.480
 You're probably, you're probably being specious against these microbes.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.480
 They're probably very interesting.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:52.400
 And I think you could probably, because I don't know actually what a microve is, but I

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.240
 reckon.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.600
 I reckon they're probably interesting when you look close at them.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.320
 Do you know the largest species that we discovered last year?

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.320
 No.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.320
 The largest new species.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.320
 I can find.

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:07.200
 So there were 2034 new plant species discovered last year alone.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:13.280
 And the biggest was a tree, a gulbertio dendron maximum, which gets up to 45 meters high and

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.280
 we hadn't found it before.

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:15.280
 Wow.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:16.280
 Good was that?

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:17.280
 No matter.

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.280
 It was great.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:21.280
 Was there anything behind this slightly bigger tree?

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.280
 No, it was hiding in Gabon.

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.280
 Oh really?

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:27.320
 Also, last year, the first ever animal found on Facebook.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.320
 What do you mean?

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.880
 No, sorry, it was an insect eating plant.

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:32.360
 I think it was identified because someone saw it on Facebook.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.360
 I don't think it had an account.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.360
 It's going to happen.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:35.360
 No, mutual friends?

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.360
 Who was the star?

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.360
 What was really cool about that?

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.360
 I saw that article.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:49.040
 And it was basically a guy found this plant and he put a picture of it on.

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:52.800
 And then he had a friend, I think, who saw it and thought, that's something new.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:56.280
 But what's great about it is because the photo was geotagged.

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.640
 They knew exactly where it was.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:02.160
 So they could go and find it and they could check it out and find out that it actually was

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:03.160
 a real new plant.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.160
 Yes.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:05.160
 It's really cool, isn't it?

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.160
 I love it.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.520
 I think maybe social media isn't such a mistake after all.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.040
 Actually, I think it's a secret categorising.

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.040
 It's like the finding.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.040
 There's a fun part.

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:17.800
 But then they're all sitting in museums or botanical gardens waiting for some point

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.480
 in turn to put them in a list.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.480
 That's true.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.480
 And that's where the hold-up is, I reckon.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.480
 That's true.

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:27.080
 2014, a new species that was discovered that was collected by Darwin.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.080
 Like, that's how.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.080
 Wow.

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.080
 Yeah.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:34.120
 So in the Natural History Museum, every week, they discover about 50 new different species

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.520
 because they're going through the backlog.

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:37.920
 So they still haven't gone through all of Darwin's stuff.

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:40.520
 And they keep going through and going, oh my god, this is a new beetle.

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:42.960
 Surely you bump that up to the top of the list.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:44.320
 That was finished Darwin.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.320
 Yeah.

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:50.120
 Oh, I've been looking up a few things about David Attenborough because he's a man who has a lot of things

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.120
 named after him.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.120
 New species.

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.120
 And a lot of species and things like that.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.960
 And, obviously, news this week.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:55.960
 Hot news.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:56.960
 No one's ever coming.

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:57.960
 His birthday.

00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:58.960
 Yeah.

00:13:58.960 --> 00:13:59.960
 Who knew.

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:00.960
 Thanks.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.960
 We'll pass that on.

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:10.000
 Pass on that incredibly half-hearted audience reaction.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 How old is he?

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 He's 90.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:22.920
 I found out this thing about him that in 2011, he sold 132-year-old murder in a sense.

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.880
 There was a murder that happened in 1879.

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:31.080
 And it was a woman called Julia Martha Thomas, who was killed by her housekeeper.

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:36.680
 It was called Kate Webster and Webster was arrested and she was tried and she was convicted

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.080
 and then executed.

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:42.160
 But one thing it was never found was the murdered woman's head.

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:47.240
 And this was found in David Attenborough's garden when he was having an extension done to his

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.240
 home.

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.240
 Where is this?

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:50.240
 2011.

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.240
 And the murder was in 1879.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.240
 OK.

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:53.240
 So it was 213-year-old.

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.240
 And he's only 90.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.240
 So he's not in the frame.

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.240
 So he plays.

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.240
 Imagine that scoop.

00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.240
 He's incredible.

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.240
 Yeah.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:09.240
 Wow.

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.240
 David.

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:14.360
 So well done him for having an extension done.

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:15.360
 Also well done.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.360
 Clevver David.

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:17.360
 Yeah.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.360
 Also well done him.

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:26.560
 I think he's probably proud of that, but when he was 89, so not long ago, he became…

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:30.720
 So what does that say?

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:34.920
 He broke the record for the deepest anyone's dive on the Great Barrier Reef.

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:39.360
 So he went down a thousand feet on the Great Barrier Reef in a submersible, with a person

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.120
 who knew how to drive a submersible.

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.120
 It was brilliant.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.120
 I just think that's incredible.

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.120
 And there's footage of him doing it.

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.120
 He looks so comfortable.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.120
 And he said it was brilliant.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.120
 He wasn't nervous at all.

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:49.520
 It was like being in a cinema or something.

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:50.520
 You're in absolute comfort.

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:56.520
 You're just in there, munching chocolate and saying, "This is wonderful."

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:59.320
 Oh, of course it looks to him at the same time.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.320
 It's just wonderful.

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.320
 Just incredible.

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:04.120
 It's not meant to be white.

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:09.640
 That's what I was thinking about the bear.

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:14.760
 It's a thing about the grizzly bear.

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:22.440
 When I was looking for stuff about Leicester City, I was reading the Leicester Mercury and

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.440
 they had a headline.

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.720
 It was today in the Leicester Mercury.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:31.440
 It said, "Should East Midlands Airport be renamed after Sir David Attenborough?"

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:37.200
 And I think we should let the internet decide.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.560
 You're pretty angry about Boatham at Boatface, right, Andy?

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:42.840
 You have come down in the month, isn't it?

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:46.200
 Well, you think we can why you want to go down?

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.200
 Obviously they've named Boat now after Sir David Attenborough instead.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.200
 Don't worry.

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.200
 Boatham at Boatface still survives.

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:54.200
 It's a remotely operated vehicle aboard David Attenborough.

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.200
 Yeah, it's a...

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.200
 Yeah, they've been...

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.200
 They've installed it on him.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.880
 It's a submarine, which it looks really beautiful.

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:04.480
 There was quite finally...

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:09.080
 There was a petition on, I think it was, "Change.org" for David Attenborough to change his

00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:12.080
 name now to Boatface.

00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:14.080
 Yeah.

00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:15.800
 But, yeah, he's also the only person...

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:16.800
 I just love this, David Attenborough.

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:21.080
 In fact, he's the only person to have received a BAFTA in five different formats.

00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:27.800
 So he's received BAFTAs in black and white, colour, HD, 3D and 4K TV.

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:31.600
 And even though no one knows what 4K TV is, that's still cool.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.600
 It's just extremely high resolution television.

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:35.120
 But, great work, David.

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.120
 Yeah.

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:38.160
 We need to move on very shortly to our next facts.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.640
 Have we got anything else before we do?

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:43.040
 I can quickly tell you about a video that I saw in YouTube if you want to.

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:47.320
 So, is this fisherman in Australia called Roddled Honey Set?

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:48.640
 And he was in Australia.

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:49.640
 And you can see the video.

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:54.080
 And there's this little thing floating around, and he's like, "Is it, I think it might be

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:57.640
 a sea slug, or is it a new species of jellyfish?"

00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:01.360
 And so he put it onto YouTube to see if people will be able to tell what it was.

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:05.000
 And they pretty quickly managed to identify it as a rather large poop.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 [laughter]

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 Amazing.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 [laughter]

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 And, who did their name enough?

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 [laughter]

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 Okay, look.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000
 We need to move on.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.600
 We need to move on to our third fact of the evening.

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.600
 And that is Jane Tarkin.

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:27.840
 Okay, my fact this week is that, as well as winning the Premier League title, the owners

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:32.840
 of Leicester City also won the World Elephant Polo Championships.

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:33.840
 [laughter]

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:36.840
 And no one is talking about that.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:37.840
 Oh, no.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:38.840
 What's going on?

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:41.320
 What, what, what, what versatile men they are.

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:42.320
 [laughter]

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:44.320
 And, does anyone go?

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:45.320
 Srivitana Brothers.

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.320
 Okay.

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:49.520
 They bought Leicester City, but they've also done another few different kind of spots.

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:53.480
 And they've really got a polo, and as well as being really good at polo, they're really

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:54.480
 good at Elephant Polo.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:59.240
 And this year they're giving loads of money to people who are really good at polo.

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:00.240
 They are going to polo.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:04.320
 The vice chairman is called Iowa, and he's one of the players on the beating for the horse

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:05.320
 polo.

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:06.320
 So they put the...

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:07.320
 Give it not the elephant polo.

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.320
 Not the elephant polo.

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:09.320
 [laughter]

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:13.480
 And I read that Miss Thailand competes in the Elephant Polo, so I don't know how high

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:14.480
 the standards are.

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:15.480
 You knew that.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.480
 Is that her talent round?

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:18.480
 [laughter]

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:19.480
 Right.

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.840
 Actually, Elephant Polo started off as a bit of a joke.

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:25.520
 It was invented by two British guys in the '90s or the '80s.

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:28.800
 They kind of thought it was just a funny thing to do, but then now it's kind of become a much

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:32.280
 bigger thing, and it's a charity event, a little bit controversial.

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:35.240
 They make a load of money, and they give it to elephant charities.

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:41.560
 But also, there was an activist called Leicchiliart from Thailand, who said Elephant and not made

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:42.560
 for polo.

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:43.560
 [laughter]

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.560
 It would be a perverse god.

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:46.560
 [laughter]

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.640
 It's true, it's true.

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:51.120
 He's quite an eccentric man, Rani Aries, isn't he?

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:52.320
 So that's the manager of Wester.

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.320
 Yes, that's the manager.

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:56.360
 Who, at the start of the season, he was the book he's favourite to be the first manager

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:57.600
 in the premiership to be sat?

00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:58.600
 I read.

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:02.560
 I think this is a guardian that said he's an eccentric who offered a win bonus of pizza

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:05.200
 at a local restaurant to incentivise his players.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.200
 [laughter]

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:09.180
 So he is that kind of, like, unattainable prize.

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:10.180
 [laughter]

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:11.180
 You know what I'm saying?

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:12.180
 You know what I'm saying?

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:18.160
 Um, he also, he used to rally them with his cry of dilly-ding, dilly-dong.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:22.200
 And when asked why that was the cry that he rallyed them with, he said it was because he couldn't

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.660
 sing, so he pretended to be a bell instead.

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:25.660
 [laughter]

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:32.640
 Well, I think they achieved that, and my favourite thing definitely, looking into the

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:38.140
 story, is the fact that because they're a Thai family, they massively subscribe to Buddhism.

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:42.860
 And so they were flying over for every home game, monks to come and bless the team.

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:46.740
 They would slap Jamie Variety and the rest of the team players' legs with these lashes

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:50.680
 that they were blessing them with, and while the team was out there, they sat back a bunch

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:55.660
 of monks chanting away, kind of guessing how the game was going based on the cheers, and

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:59.060
 just chanting away for their, to bless the team to win.

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:03.660
 They planted relics underneath the pitch, so the whole thing, it's extraordinary, it's

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:10.860
 incredible. Honestly, it's a massive Buddhist monk victory this whole season.

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:11.860
 [laughter]

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:12.860
 It's incredible, isn't it?

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:15.540
 He built them a temple, I think, or a shrine.

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:20.260
 Apparently, as someone who worked at the club, I think one of the chefs said that the pitch

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:24.420
 was full of covered in white marks from where the monks kept on blessing it, and they

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:26.260
 don't know how they're blessing it.

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:27.260
 [laughter]

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:37.260
 And I'm not just that. [laughter]

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:41.580
 So a lot of the stories about Leicester win the title is how they were 5,000 to one at the

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:46.180
 start of the year, so I thought I'd look at a few things about odds and things like that.

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:51.620
 Two guys, Skelly and Justin Tomlinson, who if either of them becomes Prime Minister, they're

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:56.460
 going to get 500,000 pounds, and that's because they put a bet on when they're at university

00:21:56.460 --> 00:22:01.740
 at 10,000 to one that they would become Prime Minister, and they're both currently Conservative

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:02.740
 MPs.

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:03.740
 [laughter]

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:10.020
 There was another thing that I saw that a lot of people put a bet on them becoming 100,

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:14.820
 turning 100, and the way that they work out the odds on that is they take your age, subtract

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:17.180
 it from 100, and that's the odds.

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:24.380
 So if I'm, what am I, 37, so that would mean that I would be 63 to 1 to reach 100, and

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:25.380
 that's how they work it out.

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:26.380
 [laughter]

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:27.380
 Okay, well that's it.

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:31.940
 That is Leicester, also the elephant polo owners, which is amazing.

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:33.700
 The champions of the world in two different sports.

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:38.780
 Let's move on to our final fact of the show, and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:44.220
 My fact is that Britain's first ever robot was designed to replace the Duke of York.

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:45.220
 [laughter]

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:50.580
 So, this is in the news, because it's a robot that we lost.

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:51.580
 We don't know where it went.

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:56.580
 It was in 1928, it was built, and there's a campaign, the Science Museum of Launching, to rebuild

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:57.580
 it.

00:22:57.580 --> 00:23:00.860
 They've got the designs, and they want to make a new one, so I think there's a Kickstarter.

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:03.180
 But this is the most incredible robot.

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:10.500
 It was called Eric, and it was in 1928, the Duke of York was meant to open an exhibition

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:15.020
 for the Society of Model Engineers, and then he dropped out, and so the guy was organising

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:20.980
 the exhibition, said, "Well, we need a replacement," and he and an engineer, and he made one, and it stood

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:26.140
 up on the day, and it made a four-minute speech, and it looked around, and it answered questions,

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:31.020
 and its teeth were sparking, because there were 35,000 volts of electricity going through them.

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:32.020
 [laughter]

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:36.460
 And then Eric just went on tour around the world, and huge audiences came to see him, and

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:38.340
 that we have no idea where he went in the end.

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:41.460
 Do you think the audience has been warned that there had been a change in booking it, or

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:43.020
 before that, I'd go like the Duke of York thinking, "Where?"

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:44.020
 [laughter]

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:51.300
 So this, just to clarify, this is a science museum Kickstarter. The science museum of London

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:56.540
 has actually set this up, and what they've had is they've found not Eric himself, the robot.

00:23:56.540 --> 00:24:00.300
 They've found the plans of the robots, and the idea is that they now want to refund it,

00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:05.820
 send him back around the world to talk to people, I guess, I don't quite know, but they're

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:10.500
 opening up quite a similar kind of robotic exhibition, so they thought let's get Eric back

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:11.500
 on the scene.

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:13.500
 Yeah, they're rebuilding a lot, I think, aren't they?

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:19.660
 I read an article in the Sunland Daily Echo from the 1930s, and they said that Eric was

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:21.460
 the perfect husband.

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:26.900
 Eric should prove the idol of all the girls, he never swers, does not stay out late at night

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:28.660
 in his truest steal.

00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:33.140
 Like a good boy, he speaks when he's spoken to, and confesses he cannot think.

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:34.140
 [laughter]

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:35.140
 That's fantastic.

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:36.140
 Yeah, but he, because this was--

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:48.940
 You saw all of his women in cheekboarding houses, in short-stay hotels, and you should see

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:51.940
 how much viagre he got.

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:56.420
 Yeah, he was, so he said he was built in, did you say where he was built, 1928, wasn't

00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:57.420
 it?

00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:01.180
 But when you look at the newspaper archives, it seems in the '30s and '40s, he became

00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:05.740
 really popular, and I checked the popularity of the name Eric.

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:08.660
 And Eric was not very popular in the '20s at all.

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:14.780
 And then in, so in 1928, there were only 186 Eric's born in Britain, but by 1948, there were

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:19.500
 two and a half thousand, and by 1958, there were more than 8,000.

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:23.380
 So I record that Eric might have caused the popularity of the name Eric.

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:24.380
 Oh my God.

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:25.380
 It's so good.

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:26.380
 Sorry.

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:27.380
 Very good.

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:32.100
 He was, so I've got a rival article to yours, from the newspaper archives, and I haven't

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:35.940
 done much paper it was from, but must have been a rival paper, because that said that he is

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:40.100
 as unattractive as any steel figure you've ever seen.

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:44.700
 And he is, if you look at pictures, but they were going to build an assistant, this article

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:45.700
 said.

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:49.180
 So it promised that they say his sister, who is now in production, is to be beautiful.

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:52.620
 She's like one of the figures in West End Store Windows.

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:55.180
 And I couldn't find anything more of the sister's manufacture.

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:58.460
 So Eric's sister, beautiful sister, maybe out there.

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:01.820
 I read about another robot that was in the news this week.

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:04.340
 So you have a loan of robots kind of stud next to each other.

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:06.660
 They're only like six inches tall or something.

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:10.100
 And they're kind of communicating to each other in their own little language.

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:15.260
 And whenever they notice that a human's coming by, they'll turn round and they'll go, oh,

00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:16.580
 hello.

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:17.740
 What do you think?

00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:21.340
 And then whatever you say to them, they go, oh, that's interesting.

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:23.940
 And they turn round and they carry on their little conversation.

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:29.020
 They don't understand anything that human says, but it's just a way of kind of pretending

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:30.540
 to be interested in humans.

00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:35.220
 So that is genuinely a push now for any robot or AI that they're trying to do.

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:38.380
 They're trying to get them to be better with humans and be more understanding.

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:40.620
 I was reading that's a Google for the past few months.

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:44.220
 They've just spoken about this this week, but this has been going on for two months or

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:45.220
 so.

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:46.220
 They have been feeding.

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:47.740
 So they have a bunch of AI computers.

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:51.980
 And the idea is that the AI computers can learn better to interact with humans through

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:53.100
 various different ways.

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:58.580
 The current way that they're doing it is that they are feeding these AI machines at Google.

00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:04.500
 Currently, they're halfway through about halfway through 2,865 romance novels.

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:08.860
 So they're just making the AI read romance novels.

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:12.820
 And like the titles like Fatal Desire jacked up on Conditional Love?

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:13.820
 Jacked up.

00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:14.820
 Jacked up.

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:16.820
 This is Jack very romantic.

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:24.620
 Well, for a robot it wouldn't be.

00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:29.980
 The idea is that apparently when we're googling things our conversation in terms of the Google.

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:35.780
 So we'll sometimes do quite a sort of chatty Google is very predictable and the best predictable

00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:38.900
 dialogue you can find is in romance novels.

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:42.580
 And so they look to that and they feed it in so they come back.

00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:48.180
 Another just on the whole thing about big companies trying to work AI into Google doing

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:50.620
 the romance novels Microsoft a while ago.

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:52.900
 Did you read about their chatbot?

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:54.780
 Does everyone know about this chatbot?

00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:55.780
 Oh my god.

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:56.780
 Okay.

00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:57.780
 Everyone knows.

00:27:57.780 --> 00:27:58.780
 Let's move on.

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:02.920
 I could say if you don't know it in the room, basically they had this chatbot whereby they

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:06.940
 thought that it would just start its own Twitter feed and it would start talking to people.

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:11.860
 And within 24 hours it transformed itself into what the article says is an evil Hitler

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:18.180
 loving, incestuous, sex-promoting, bush-did-9/11, proclaiming robot.

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:23.860
 And all of its tweets to people writing to her said that she started calling them daddy

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:26.060
 and asking them to shag her.

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:29.700
 I thought that's her romance novels.

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:34.260
 She has since announced that she will be voting trumps.

00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:35.260
 But yeah, it goes wrong.

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:38.260
 They thought they were going to do something that would respond fantastically well.

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:43.020
 Did it take things that people were, or that were proving especially a contractual

00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:44.020
 Twitter?

00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:49.420
 Because it learned from what people were tweeting towards it and so people started, they realized

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:52.820
 that and started tweeting, really racist things and it just picked it all up.

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:55.500
 We had a wrap up really shortly, so if you've got anything.

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:58.540
 I have a quick thing about the Duke of York.

00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:02.180
 I remember that.

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:06.740
 I just thought I'd see what's going on in Duke of York news because of the Britain's

00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:07.740
 first robot thing.

00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:12.620
 So in the last month, Prince Andrew has opened a business club in Hungate.

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:17.740
 He has opened a luxury bed factory in Castle Donington and around about in Kent named after

00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:22.460
 him has caught fire.

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:24.340
 So we're going to wrap up very shortly.

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:27.660
 There were a bunch of stories that we really wanted to talk about tonight as our headline

00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:29.500
 topics, but we didn't get time.

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:33.220
 So just very quickly, could you just let us know Jane's Andy and Anna what you would have

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:34.220
 gone for tonight?

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:35.220
 I can't.

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:39.260
 One that we didn't get a chance to say is this one, which is new research, reveals that

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:48.460
 the 20% of Americans are put off by the word moist, moist.

00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:49.460
 Anyone?

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:50.460
 Moist.

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:53.860
 Definitely a few people over there.

00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:55.820
 Anna, what do you got?

00:29:55.820 --> 00:30:01.980
 I like this that after a man in Croydon lost a bet with a friend, the frozen food company

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:12.700
 Iceland has warned shoppers not to lie down in their freezers to cool off.

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:14.420
 And finally, Andy?

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:19.060
 In China, under new guidelines from the Ministry of Culture, live streaming services have

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:24.420
 banned the eating of bananas in a neurotic manner.

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:31.060
 But someone, an unnamed Chinese person, has to have said they will eat yams instead.

00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:32.060
 OK, that's it.

00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:33.540
 That is all of our facts.

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:35.020
 Thank you so much for being here tonight.

00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:36.420
 Thank you all for watching at home.

00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:39.460
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us about the things we've said over the course

00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:43.780
 of this podcast, we can be found on no such thing as the news.com where you can see all

00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:47.180
 the stories we're talking about tonight, as well as additional stories that didn't make

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:48.180
 it into the show.

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:51.740
 We will be back again next week with another batch of our favorite news stories from the

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:52.740
 past seven days.

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:53.740
 We'll see you then.

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:54.740
 Goodbye.

00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:56.740
 [APPLAUSE]

00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:58.740
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:00.740
 [APPLAUSE]

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:03.320
 (upbeat music)

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:04.800
 (upbeat music)
