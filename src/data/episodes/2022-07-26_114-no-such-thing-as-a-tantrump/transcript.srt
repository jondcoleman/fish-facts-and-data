1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
 One welcome to another episode and no such thing as a fish.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,440
 We have a very exciting day ahead of us.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,800
 We are on our way to the studio to record the very first episode of no such thing as the

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,800
 news.

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:18,440
 It's our BBC 2 TV show and it's going to air May 20th at 11.05 pm on BBC 2.

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,000
 So we need you guys to watch it.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 We really need you to watch it because if you don't watch it, they'll cancel us.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 We will lose the entire series.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,600
 So please, if you like our show, if you're hearing this now, cancel your Friday night plans

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,800
 and come to the TV, sit down, make yourself some tea and watch our show.

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,280
 We'd really appreciate it and please spread the word.

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,200
 If you want to watch it on I Player a little bit later, that is also okay with us.

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,520
 Just watch it at some point and you can go to the no such thing as a fish YouTube channel

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,360
 and catch it there anytime from Sunday morning.

15
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,080
 The episode you're about to hear now is the on-ed pilot which we recorded last week.

16
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,080
 So enjoy.

17
00:00:54,080 --> 00:01:17,000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as the news coming to you from

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,600
 up the Crete Comby Club in Greenwich London.

19
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,800
 My name is Dan Schreiber and please welcome it's Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and

20
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:33,200
 James Harkin.

21
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,720
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our favourite facts from

22
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:43,000
 the last seven days of news and in no particular order, here we go, starting with you, Chazinski.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,120
 My fact this week is that the first thing that Ted Cruz did after dropping it out of the

24
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,400
 Republican contest was Elba's wife in the face.

25
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:57,640
 And this was so you probably saw that about a week ago, Ted Cruz dropped out the Republican

26
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:05,400
 race leaving Donald Trump as the only contender for the throne of America.

27
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,240
 And yeah, it's just a great YouTube clip.

28
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,240
 You should watch it.

29
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,880
 He makes this speech in Indiana saying he's very sorry but he seems to have not gone that

30
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,880
 well for him.

31
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,880
 He turns away from the microphone.

32
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:18,360
 Elba's his wife in the face as he's hugging his dad and then he sort of tries to compensate

33
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,920
 for it by then trying to do a three-way hug with his dad and his wife and then sort of

34
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,560
 slaps her about a bit as he goes back to do that.

35
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,880
 And that was just seemed like an awkward end to an awkward campaign.

36
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,120
 I think he's got a very unfortunate time, Ted Cruz.

37
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:40,760
 First of all, Donald Trump made a reference to JFK's killing and accused Cruz at some point

38
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,880
 of having done in a photo with Lee Harvey Oswald to release.

39
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,880
 I don't know.

40
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,880
 I don't know.

41
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,880
 He was far, sorry.

42
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,640
 He's just far though of being a photo of Lee Harvey Oswald.

43
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,640
 Yeah.

44
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,880
 So he's the spawn of the murderer.

45
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,840
 And then everyone in America seems to think that he is the zodiac killer.

46
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,080
 Even though his first murder was committed two years before Cruz was born.

47
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,680
 I find it like there was, he had a non-line story that had lots of odd products.

48
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,240
 If you were trying to eventually run for president, you wouldn't naturally have.

49
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:14,600
 There was this one debate that he had with Donald Trump where he started telling Donald Trump

50
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,600
 to breathe.

51
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,600
 And Trump was like, "Well, you breathe.

52
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,600
 I'm breathing.

53
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,600
 Why can't you breathe?"

54
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,600
 And he was like, "Oh, I'm breathing.

55
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,600
 Why don't you breathe?"

56
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,360
 They just had this real kind of like, breathe-off kind of conversation.

57
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,040
 And then Rubio comes in and he's like, "When you guys are done doing yoga."

58
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,200
 And it's like these weird calls.

59
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:35,160
 And then so, Ted Cruz, then a few days later, for 35 bucks on his website, you could buy

60
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:42,400
 the Ted Cruz Breathe Exercise Matt that you would just learn to breathe better on.

61
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,880
 So he was just running with these gangs and then he got sued by a company who are a yoga

62
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,720
 company who are called Breathe saying you can't suddenly start selling Breathe Yoga Matt on

63
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,720
 your website.

64
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,900
 So he had to take the whole Breathe thing away.

65
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,880
 So then he just was selling Exercise Matt, you know?

66
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,880
 Just for no reason, it's just why not get an Exercise Matt of mine?

67
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,920
 It's the whole joke, I guess we're now selling Exercise Matt.

68
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:14,600
 So it looks now it's going to be Trump versus Clinton, right, in the American presidential

69
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,600
 race.

70
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,920
 And it means it's going to be the most unpopular presidential candidates in my lifetime,

71
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:26,120
 versus the second most popular candidate in my lifetime, and by a long, long way as well.

72
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,120
 Yeah.

73
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,320
 I think PJ walked, tweeted a couple of days ago that this came out in support for Hillary

74
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,560
 and it was a story and the tweet was everyone vote for Hillary, it's the second worst thing

75
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,000
 that could possibly happen to the world.

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,840
 There was a poll this week by the public policy poll and they like tested how popular Donald

77
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:52,200
 Trump is compared to various different things and it turned out that he is less popular than

78
00:04:52,200 --> 00:05:04,920
 the traffic jams, used car salesmen, hipsters, jury duty, the band's nickel back, root canal

79
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,040
 surgery and lice.

80
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,800
 There's another on Ted Cruz's website, there's another product that he sold, which is a thing

81
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,720
 that he started, a kind of what he was trying to guess to be a kind of meme going round,

82
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,560
 which is about, he called it Trump or Tantrum.

83
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,560
 So the idea is, every time Donald Trump was throwing a tantrum, he was like, it's a Trump

84
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,640
 or a tantrum and I looked at just the basic words and you think, why didn't you just call

85
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,560
 it a tantrum?

86
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,920
 And I don't trust someone who doesn't recognise a good pun.

87
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,920
 So...

88
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,160
 Do you know how to tell if he's angry actually?

89
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,160
 Donald Trump.

90
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,160
 Yeah.

91
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,160
 No.

92
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,720
 He, as I'm talking about, he starts building walls, he wears a red hat when he's angry.

93
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,280
 This is according to his butler, who I think wrote a book a couple of months ago, a few

94
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,400
 months ago and said that the way to tell his mood is by the colour of hat that he's wearing

95
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,280
 and when he's pissed off, he wears a red hat and that is when to leave Iran.

96
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,880
 So there's a fit, this is the American elections.

97
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,320
 We have the British local elections this week.

98
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,600
 I was a few funny, amusing things that happened there.

99
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,560
 In Wolverhampton, the Conservative Party accidentally put two people up for elections, so they

100
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,360
 came first and third.

101
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,360
 Welcome.

102
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,160
 Yeah, but the thing is, they took votes off each other.

103
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,400
 So one of them said no, no vote for him, vote for him but people didn't really pay any attention.

104
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:28,120
 And if the guy who came third got just 60 more votes, then Labour would have gotten.

105
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:33,560
 And also, there's election going on in the Philippines at the moment with the most unbelievably

106
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:41,040
 weird man who's just wanted and his campaign slogan is basically I will kill all the criminals.

107
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:51,280
 Well, do we go Duterte or Duterte, or the Punisher, as they call it.

108
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,520
 It is Duterte, I think, because his nickname and his old job was Duterte Harry.

109
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,760
 Oh, see, that is a good pun.

110
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,000
 Ted Cruz could learn something up there.

111
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,560
 And that's how he got into power.

112
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,320
 In an interview, many are asking what my credentials are and what I can do for the Philippines.

113
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,560
 They're telling me that they have heard I will womanize her.

114
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,560
 That is true.

115
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,560
 That is very true.

116
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,360
 He said, well, in a press conference, he just said that.

117
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,840
 He's point, he's voted about his multiple affairs and the fact he uses a lot of my anger

118
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,840
 to keep himself going.

119
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,640
 He's voted about his my anger use.

120
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,920
 Yeah, it's very confident, isn't it?

121
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:37,880
 You wait till you see the pills I have to take to sustain this.

122
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:45,280
 He's got an advertising contact with his side, but yeah, he's reassured the public after

123
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,920
 boasting that all his affairs, that his mistresses won't cost the public a lot because he keeps

124
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:56,240
 them in sheen boarding house and he takes up to short stay hotels for sex.

125
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,720
 He's quite a character.

126
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,520
 He's like one of these strong men, kind of presidents, that kind of coming in around the

127
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,520
 world.

128
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,520
 I think he's one of those kind of guys.

129
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,520
 Right.

130
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,120
 We need to move on to our final facts soon.

131
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,960
 So anyone got anything before we do?

132
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,160
 Can I just quickly relate one thing about the recent UK election?

133
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,160
 Yeah.

134
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:19,600
 In case you missed it, there was a Labour counsellor called Duncan N. Wright and he wanted

135
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:24,640
 to be the counsellor for Whitney in the West Oxfordshire area and he sent a tweet out after

136
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:29,680
 the elections just saying, lost by 70 votes or so, thanks for the opportunity to serve.

137
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,080
 The fight goes on and then about 20 minutes later he sent another tweet saying, actually,

138
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,000
 it turns out I won, fondle of my votes under a Tory pile.

139
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 Thanks, Whitney.

140
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,920
 And they just, that's how casual voting is in this country.

141
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,080
 Oh, we found a bunch more votes under this pile of paper.

142
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,080
 Sorry.

143
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,400
 The fight can stop immediately.

144
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,400
 All right.

145
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,400
 So there we have it.

146
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,320
 Ted Cruz, accidentally, elbows his wife in the face.

147
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,440
 Now we are moving on to our second fact of the show and that is my fact.

148
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,960
 My fact this week is that this week scientists have discovered that we still haven't discovered

149
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,920
 99.99% of life on Earth.

150
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,920
 That's a lot.

151
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:18,200
 Now, the big story that was in the news this week about this is that there's an estimate

152
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,440
 of how much life on Earth there is and it changes all the time, but it's quite manageable

153
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,760
 in a way for counting purposes.

154
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:30,400
 So in 2011, they thought there was about 8.7 million different forms of life on the planet.

155
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,520
 They just found out through this new study that they reckoned that that number has gone

156
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:42,120
 up from 8.7 million to one trillion, one trillion, what are these things that we haven't?

157
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,120
 They found it.

158
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,160
 There's a lot of sports to be had.

159
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,520
 Is it very, very small things that we haven't?

160
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,520
 Yeah, it's microbes.

161
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,520
 It's microbes.

162
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:57,520
 What they did is there's a way of kind of working things out called scaling laws and say

163
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:03,100
 you know how big an animal is, you can kind of tell what its metabolism is and if the

164
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,280
 bigger it is, the more it is, so you can put the size of the animal in it and you can work

165
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,280
 out its metabolism.

166
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:11,560
 That's an example of things and another way of doing this is you can work out how many big

167
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:16,440
 animals there are in an area and then by putting them into an equation, you can work out

168
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,880
 how many microbes or how many small animals there are as well and so they've worked out how

169
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,200
 many big animals they think there are and they've put it into the scaling equation and

170
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,960
 they've come out with one trillion.

171
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:30,280
 We just don't know, I mean they are making this up, I think.

172
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,280
 That's true.

173
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,560
 They said that there's between 100 billion and 1 trillion.

174
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:40,440
 So that is actually quite a large gap between those two numbers if you think about it.

175
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,480
 Don't think about it, just let me know.

176
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,480
 It is amazing.

177
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,360
 The difference between a billion and a trillion is it's a number that I'm unable properly

178
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,880
 to understand.

179
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,360
 So I started thinking about it.

180
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,080
 I first thought, okay, everyone always has this dream of having a species named after

181
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,080
 them.

182
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,640
 So I thought, well, if there's a trillion surely there's enough for us all, right, to go around.

183
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,640
 So I looked into it.

184
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,640
 And more than enough.

185
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,640
 Yeah, exactly.

186
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,200
 So I looked into how many people have existed on earth ever, all the dead people, all the

187
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:11,840
 living people combined and apparently according to the population reference of euro, they estimate

188
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:18,360
 that about 107 billion people have ever existed, which means that's a bit less than a trillion

189
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,400
 so we could do it.

190
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,560
 And that's really, that's insane, the differentiation of life on our planet.

191
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,040
 Yeah, but most of those people don't want some crappy bit of bacteria named after them.

192
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:32,120
 They want a large mammal, a large, ambitious mammal.

193
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,240
 That's what's so disappointing about this.

194
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,240
 You hear this fact?

195
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,720
 You're like brilliant lions everywhere, different species of lions.

196
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,640
 Oh good, it's tiny microbes again.

197
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,360
 They're probably really interesting.

198
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,480
 You're probably, you're probably being specious against these microbes.

199
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,480
 They're probably very interesting.

200
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,400
 And I think you could probably, because I don't know actually what a microve is, but I

201
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,240
 reckon.

202
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,600
 I reckon they're probably interesting when you look close at them.

203
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,320
 Do you know the largest species that we discovered last year?

204
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,320
 No.

205
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,320
 The largest new species.

206
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,320
 I can find.

207
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,200
 So there were 2034 new plant species discovered last year alone.

208
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:13,280
 And the biggest was a tree, a gulbertio dendron maximum, which gets up to 45 meters high and

209
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,280
 we hadn't found it before.

210
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,280
 Wow.

211
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,280
 Good was that?

212
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,280
 No matter.

213
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,280
 It was great.

214
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,280
 Was there anything behind this slightly bigger tree?

215
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,280
 No, it was hiding in Gabon.

216
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,280
 Oh really?

217
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,320
 Also, last year, the first ever animal found on Facebook.

218
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,320
 What do you mean?

219
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,880
 No, sorry, it was an insect eating plant.

220
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,360
 I think it was identified because someone saw it on Facebook.

221
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,360
 I don't think it had an account.

222
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,360
 It's going to happen.

223
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,360
 No, mutual friends?

224
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,360
 Who was the star?

225
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,360
 What was really cool about that?

226
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,360
 I saw that article.

227
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:49,040
 And it was basically a guy found this plant and he put a picture of it on.

228
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,800
 And then he had a friend, I think, who saw it and thought, that's something new.

229
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,280
 But what's great about it is because the photo was geotagged.

230
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,640
 They knew exactly where it was.

231
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:02,160
 So they could go and find it and they could check it out and find out that it actually was

232
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,160
 a real new plant.

233
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,160
 Yes.

234
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,160
 It's really cool, isn't it?

235
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,160
 I love it.

236
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,520
 I think maybe social media isn't such a mistake after all.

237
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,040
 Actually, I think it's a secret categorising.

238
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,040
 It's like the finding.

239
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,040
 There's a fun part.

240
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,800
 But then they're all sitting in museums or botanical gardens waiting for some point

241
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,480
 in turn to put them in a list.

242
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,480
 That's true.

243
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,480
 And that's where the hold-up is, I reckon.

244
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,480
 That's true.

245
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,080
 2014, a new species that was discovered that was collected by Darwin.

246
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,080
 Like, that's how.

247
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,080
 Wow.

248
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,080
 Yeah.

249
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:34,120
 So in the Natural History Museum, every week, they discover about 50 new different species

250
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,520
 because they're going through the backlog.

251
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,920
 So they still haven't gone through all of Darwin's stuff.

252
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,520
 And they keep going through and going, oh my god, this is a new beetle.

253
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,960
 Surely you bump that up to the top of the list.

254
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,320
 That was finished Darwin.

255
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,320
 Yeah.

256
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:50,120
 Oh, I've been looking up a few things about David Attenborough because he's a man who has a lot of things

257
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,120
 named after him.

258
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,120
 New species.

259
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,120
 And a lot of species and things like that.

260
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,960
 And, obviously, news this week.

261
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,960
 Hot news.

262
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,960
 No one's ever coming.

263
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,960
 His birthday.

264
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,960
 Yeah.

265
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,960
 Who knew.

266
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,960
 Thanks.

267
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,960
 We'll pass that on.

268
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:10,000
 Pass on that incredibly half-hearted audience reaction.

269
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 How old is he?

270
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 He's 90.

271
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:22,920
 I found out this thing about him that in 2011, he sold 132-year-old murder in a sense.

272
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,880
 There was a murder that happened in 1879.

273
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:31,080
 And it was a woman called Julia Martha Thomas, who was killed by her housekeeper.

274
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:36,680
 It was called Kate Webster and Webster was arrested and she was tried and she was convicted

275
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,080
 and then executed.

276
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,160
 But one thing it was never found was the murdered woman's head.

277
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:47,240
 And this was found in David Attenborough's garden when he was having an extension done to his

278
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,240
 home.

279
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,240
 Where is this?

280
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,240
 2011.

281
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,240
 And the murder was in 1879.

282
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,240
 OK.

283
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,240
 So it was 213-year-old.

284
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,240
 And he's only 90.

285
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,240
 So he's not in the frame.

286
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,240
 So he plays.

287
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,240
 Imagine that scoop.

288
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,240
 He's incredible.

289
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,240
 Yeah.

290
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:09,240
 Wow.

291
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,240
 David.

292
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,360
 So well done him for having an extension done.

293
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,360
 Also well done.

294
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,360
 Clevver David.

295
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,360
 Yeah.

296
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,360
 Also well done him.

297
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:26,560
 I think he's probably proud of that, but when he was 89, so not long ago, he became…

298
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,720
 So what does that say?

299
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,920
 He broke the record for the deepest anyone's dive on the Great Barrier Reef.

300
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:39,360
 So he went down a thousand feet on the Great Barrier Reef in a submersible, with a person

301
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,120
 who knew how to drive a submersible.

302
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,120
 It was brilliant.

303
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,120
 I just think that's incredible.

304
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,120
 And there's footage of him doing it.

305
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,120
 He looks so comfortable.

306
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,120
 And he said it was brilliant.

307
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,120
 He wasn't nervous at all.

308
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,520
 It was like being in a cinema or something.

309
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,520
 You're in absolute comfort.

310
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:56,520
 You're just in there, munching chocolate and saying, "This is wonderful."

311
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,320
 Oh, of course it looks to him at the same time.

312
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,320
 It's just wonderful.

313
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,320
 Just incredible.

314
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,120
 It's not meant to be white.

315
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:09,640
 That's what I was thinking about the bear.

316
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:14,760
 It's a thing about the grizzly bear.

317
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:22,440
 When I was looking for stuff about Leicester City, I was reading the Leicester Mercury and

318
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,440
 they had a headline.

319
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,720
 It was today in the Leicester Mercury.

320
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:31,440
 It said, "Should East Midlands Airport be renamed after Sir David Attenborough?"

321
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:37,200
 And I think we should let the internet decide.

322
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,560
 You're pretty angry about Boatham at Boatface, right, Andy?

323
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,840
 You have come down in the month, isn't it?

324
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:46,200
 Well, you think we can why you want to go down?

325
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,200
 Obviously they've named Boat now after Sir David Attenborough instead.

326
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,200
 Don't worry.

327
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,200
 Boatham at Boatface still survives.

328
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,200
 It's a remotely operated vehicle aboard David Attenborough.

329
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,200
 Yeah, it's a...

330
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,200
 Yeah, they've been...

331
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,200
 They've installed it on him.

332
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,880
 It's a submarine, which it looks really beautiful.

333
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,480
 There was quite finally...

334
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,080
 There was a petition on, I think it was, "Change.org" for David Attenborough to change his

335
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:12,080
 name now to Boatface.

336
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,080
 Yeah.

337
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,800
 But, yeah, he's also the only person...

338
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,800
 I just love this, David Attenborough.

339
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:21,080
 In fact, he's the only person to have received a BAFTA in five different formats.

340
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:27,800
 So he's received BAFTAs in black and white, colour, HD, 3D and 4K TV.

341
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,600
 And even though no one knows what 4K TV is, that's still cool.

342
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,600
 It's just extremely high resolution television.

343
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,120
 But, great work, David.

344
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,120
 Yeah.

345
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,160
 We need to move on very shortly to our next facts.

346
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,640
 Have we got anything else before we do?

347
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,040
 I can quickly tell you about a video that I saw in YouTube if you want to.

348
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:47,320
 So, is this fisherman in Australia called Roddled Honey Set?

349
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,640
 And he was in Australia.

350
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,640
 And you can see the video.

351
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:54,080
 And there's this little thing floating around, and he's like, "Is it, I think it might be

352
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,640
 a sea slug, or is it a new species of jellyfish?"

353
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:01,360
 And so he put it onto YouTube to see if people will be able to tell what it was.

354
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,000
 And they pretty quickly managed to identify it as a rather large poop.

355
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 [laughter]

356
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 Amazing.

357
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 [laughter]

358
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 And, who did their name enough?

359
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 [laughter]

360
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 Okay, look.

361
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 We need to move on.

362
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,600
 We need to move on to our third fact of the evening.

363
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,600
 And that is Jane Tarkin.

364
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:27,840
 Okay, my fact this week is that, as well as winning the Premier League title, the owners

365
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,840
 of Leicester City also won the World Elephant Polo Championships.

366
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,840
 [laughter]

367
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,840
 And no one is talking about that.

368
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,840
 Oh, no.

369
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,840
 What's going on?

370
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,320
 What, what, what, what versatile men they are.

371
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,320
 [laughter]

372
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,320
 And, does anyone go?

373
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,320
 Srivitana Brothers.

374
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,320
 Okay.

375
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,520
 They bought Leicester City, but they've also done another few different kind of spots.

376
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,480
 And they've really got a polo, and as well as being really good at polo, they're really

377
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,480
 good at Elephant Polo.

378
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,240
 And this year they're giving loads of money to people who are really good at polo.

379
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,240
 They are going to polo.

380
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,320
 The vice chairman is called Iowa, and he's one of the players on the beating for the horse

381
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,320
 polo.

382
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,320
 So they put the...

383
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,320
 Give it not the elephant polo.

384
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,320
 Not the elephant polo.

385
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,320
 [laughter]

386
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,480
 And I read that Miss Thailand competes in the Elephant Polo, so I don't know how high

387
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,480
 the standards are.

388
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,480
 You knew that.

389
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,480
 Is that her talent round?

390
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,480
 [laughter]

391
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,480
 Right.

392
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,840
 Actually, Elephant Polo started off as a bit of a joke.

393
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,520
 It was invented by two British guys in the '90s or the '80s.

394
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,800
 They kind of thought it was just a funny thing to do, but then now it's kind of become a much

395
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,280
 bigger thing, and it's a charity event, a little bit controversial.

396
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,240
 They make a load of money, and they give it to elephant charities.

397
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:41,560
 But also, there was an activist called Leicchiliart from Thailand, who said Elephant and not made

398
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,560
 for polo.

399
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,560
 [laughter]

400
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,560
 It would be a perverse god.

401
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,560
 [laughter]

402
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,640
 It's true, it's true.

403
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,120
 He's quite an eccentric man, Rani Aries, isn't he?

404
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,320
 So that's the manager of Wester.

405
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,320
 Yes, that's the manager.

406
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,360
 Who, at the start of the season, he was the book he's favourite to be the first manager

407
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,600
 in the premiership to be sat?

408
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,600
 I read.

409
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,560
 I think this is a guardian that said he's an eccentric who offered a win bonus of pizza

410
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,200
 at a local restaurant to incentivise his players.

411
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,200
 [laughter]

412
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,180
 So he is that kind of, like, unattainable prize.

413
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,180
 [laughter]

414
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,180
 You know what I'm saying?

415
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,180
 You know what I'm saying?

416
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:18,160
 Um, he also, he used to rally them with his cry of dilly-ding, dilly-dong.

417
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,200
 And when asked why that was the cry that he rallyed them with, he said it was because he couldn't

418
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,660
 sing, so he pretended to be a bell instead.

419
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,660
 [laughter]

420
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:32,640
 Well, I think they achieved that, and my favourite thing definitely, looking into the

421
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,140
 story, is the fact that because they're a Thai family, they massively subscribe to Buddhism.

422
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:42,860
 And so they were flying over for every home game, monks to come and bless the team.

423
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:46,740
 They would slap Jamie Variety and the rest of the team players' legs with these lashes

424
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:50,680
 that they were blessing them with, and while the team was out there, they sat back a bunch

425
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:55,660
 of monks chanting away, kind of guessing how the game was going based on the cheers, and

426
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:59,060
 just chanting away for their, to bless the team to win.

427
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:03,660
 They planted relics underneath the pitch, so the whole thing, it's extraordinary, it's

428
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:10,860
 incredible. Honestly, it's a massive Buddhist monk victory this whole season.

429
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:11,860
 [laughter]

430
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,860
 It's incredible, isn't it?

431
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:15,540
 He built them a temple, I think, or a shrine.

432
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:20,260
 Apparently, as someone who worked at the club, I think one of the chefs said that the pitch

433
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:24,420
 was full of covered in white marks from where the monks kept on blessing it, and they

434
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,260
 don't know how they're blessing it.

435
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,260
 [laughter]

436
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:37,260
 And I'm not just that. [laughter]

437
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:41,580
 So a lot of the stories about Leicester win the title is how they were 5,000 to one at the

438
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:46,180
 start of the year, so I thought I'd look at a few things about odds and things like that.

439
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:51,620
 Two guys, Skelly and Justin Tomlinson, who if either of them becomes Prime Minister, they're

440
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:56,460
 going to get 500,000 pounds, and that's because they put a bet on when they're at university

441
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:01,740
 at 10,000 to one that they would become Prime Minister, and they're both currently Conservative

442
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,740
 MPs.

443
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,740
 [laughter]

444
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:10,020
 There was another thing that I saw that a lot of people put a bet on them becoming 100,

445
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:14,820
 turning 100, and the way that they work out the odds on that is they take your age, subtract

446
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,180
 it from 100, and that's the odds.

447
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:24,380
 So if I'm, what am I, 37, so that would mean that I would be 63 to 1 to reach 100, and

448
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,380
 that's how they work it out.

449
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,380
 [laughter]

450
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,380
 Okay, well that's it.

451
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:31,940
 That is Leicester, also the elephant polo owners, which is amazing.

452
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,700
 The champions of the world in two different sports.

453
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:38,780
 Let's move on to our final fact of the show, and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

454
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:44,220
 My fact is that Britain's first ever robot was designed to replace the Duke of York.

455
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,220
 [laughter]

456
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:50,580
 So, this is in the news, because it's a robot that we lost.

457
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,580
 We don't know where it went.

458
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:56,580
 It was in 1928, it was built, and there's a campaign, the Science Museum of Launching, to rebuild

459
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,580
 it.

460
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:00,860
 They've got the designs, and they want to make a new one, so I think there's a Kickstarter.

461
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:03,180
 But this is the most incredible robot.

462
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:10,500
 It was called Eric, and it was in 1928, the Duke of York was meant to open an exhibition

463
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:15,020
 for the Society of Model Engineers, and then he dropped out, and so the guy was organising

464
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:20,980
 the exhibition, said, "Well, we need a replacement," and he and an engineer, and he made one, and it stood

465
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:26,140
 up on the day, and it made a four-minute speech, and it looked around, and it answered questions,

466
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:31,020
 and its teeth were sparking, because there were 35,000 volts of electricity going through them.

467
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,020
 [laughter]

468
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:36,460
 And then Eric just went on tour around the world, and huge audiences came to see him, and

469
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,340
 that we have no idea where he went in the end.

470
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:41,460
 Do you think the audience has been warned that there had been a change in booking it, or

471
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,020
 before that, I'd go like the Duke of York thinking, "Where?"

472
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,020
 [laughter]

473
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:51,300
 So this, just to clarify, this is a science museum Kickstarter. The science museum of London

474
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:56,540
 has actually set this up, and what they've had is they've found not Eric himself, the robot.

475
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:00,300
 They've found the plans of the robots, and the idea is that they now want to refund it,

476
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:05,820
 send him back around the world to talk to people, I guess, I don't quite know, but they're

477
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:10,500
 opening up quite a similar kind of robotic exhibition, so they thought let's get Eric back

478
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,500
 on the scene.

479
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,500
 Yeah, they're rebuilding a lot, I think, aren't they?

480
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:19,660
 I read an article in the Sunland Daily Echo from the 1930s, and they said that Eric was

481
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,460
 the perfect husband.

482
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:26,900
 Eric should prove the idol of all the girls, he never swers, does not stay out late at night

483
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,660
 in his truest steal.

484
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:33,140
 Like a good boy, he speaks when he's spoken to, and confesses he cannot think.

485
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,140
 [laughter]

486
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,140
 That's fantastic.

487
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,140
 Yeah, but he, because this was--

488
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:48,940
 You saw all of his women in cheekboarding houses, in short-stay hotels, and you should see

489
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:51,940
 how much viagre he got.

490
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:56,420
 Yeah, he was, so he said he was built in, did you say where he was built, 1928, wasn't

491
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,420
 it?

492
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:01,180
 But when you look at the newspaper archives, it seems in the '30s and '40s, he became

493
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:05,740
 really popular, and I checked the popularity of the name Eric.

494
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:08,660
 And Eric was not very popular in the '20s at all.

495
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:14,780
 And then in, so in 1928, there were only 186 Eric's born in Britain, but by 1948, there were

496
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:19,500
 two and a half thousand, and by 1958, there were more than 8,000.

497
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,380
 So I record that Eric might have caused the popularity of the name Eric.

498
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,380
 Oh my God.

499
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,380
 It's so good.

500
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,380
 Sorry.

501
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,380
 Very good.

502
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:32,100
 He was, so I've got a rival article to yours, from the newspaper archives, and I haven't

503
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:35,940
 done much paper it was from, but must have been a rival paper, because that said that he is

504
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:40,100
 as unattractive as any steel figure you've ever seen.

505
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:44,700
 And he is, if you look at pictures, but they were going to build an assistant, this article

506
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,700
 said.

507
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:49,180
 So it promised that they say his sister, who is now in production, is to be beautiful.

508
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:52,620
 She's like one of the figures in West End Store Windows.

509
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,180
 And I couldn't find anything more of the sister's manufacture.

510
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:58,460
 So Eric's sister, beautiful sister, maybe out there.

511
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:01,820
 I read about another robot that was in the news this week.

512
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:04,340
 So you have a loan of robots kind of stud next to each other.

513
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,660
 They're only like six inches tall or something.

514
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:10,100
 And they're kind of communicating to each other in their own little language.

515
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:15,260
 And whenever they notice that a human's coming by, they'll turn round and they'll go, oh,

516
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,580
 hello.

517
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,740
 What do you think?

518
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:21,340
 And then whatever you say to them, they go, oh, that's interesting.

519
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,940
 And they turn round and they carry on their little conversation.

520
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:29,020
 They don't understand anything that human says, but it's just a way of kind of pretending

521
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,540
 to be interested in humans.

522
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:35,220
 So that is genuinely a push now for any robot or AI that they're trying to do.

523
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:38,380
 They're trying to get them to be better with humans and be more understanding.

524
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,620
 I was reading that's a Google for the past few months.

525
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:44,220
 They've just spoken about this this week, but this has been going on for two months or

526
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,220
 so.

527
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,220
 They have been feeding.

528
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,740
 So they have a bunch of AI computers.

529
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:51,980
 And the idea is that the AI computers can learn better to interact with humans through

530
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,100
 various different ways.

531
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:58,580
 The current way that they're doing it is that they are feeding these AI machines at Google.

532
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:04,500
 Currently, they're halfway through about halfway through 2,865 romance novels.

533
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,860
 So they're just making the AI read romance novels.

534
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:12,820
 And like the titles like Fatal Desire jacked up on Conditional Love?

535
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:13,820
 Jacked up.

536
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,820
 Jacked up.

537
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,820
 This is Jack very romantic.

538
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:24,620
 Well, for a robot it wouldn't be.

539
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:29,980
 The idea is that apparently when we're googling things our conversation in terms of the Google.

540
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:35,780
 So we'll sometimes do quite a sort of chatty Google is very predictable and the best predictable

541
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:38,900
 dialogue you can find is in romance novels.

542
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:42,580
 And so they look to that and they feed it in so they come back.

543
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:48,180
 Another just on the whole thing about big companies trying to work AI into Google doing

544
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,620
 the romance novels Microsoft a while ago.

545
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,900
 Did you read about their chatbot?

546
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,780
 Does everyone know about this chatbot?

547
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,780
 Oh my god.

548
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:56,780
 Okay.

549
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,780
 Everyone knows.

550
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:58,780
 Let's move on.

551
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:02,920
 I could say if you don't know it in the room, basically they had this chatbot whereby they

552
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:06,940
 thought that it would just start its own Twitter feed and it would start talking to people.

553
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:11,860
 And within 24 hours it transformed itself into what the article says is an evil Hitler

554
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:18,180
 loving, incestuous, sex-promoting, bush-did-9/11, proclaiming robot.

555
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:23,860
 And all of its tweets to people writing to her said that she started calling them daddy

556
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:26,060
 and asking them to shag her.

557
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:29,700
 I thought that's her romance novels.

558
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:34,260
 She has since announced that she will be voting trumps.

559
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,260
 But yeah, it goes wrong.

560
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:38,260
 They thought they were going to do something that would respond fantastically well.

561
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:43,020
 Did it take things that people were, or that were proving especially a contractual

562
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,020
 Twitter?

563
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:49,420
 Because it learned from what people were tweeting towards it and so people started, they realized

564
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:52,820
 that and started tweeting, really racist things and it just picked it all up.

565
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:55,500
 We had a wrap up really shortly, so if you've got anything.

566
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,540
 I have a quick thing about the Duke of York.

567
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:02,180
 I remember that.

568
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:06,740
 I just thought I'd see what's going on in Duke of York news because of the Britain's

569
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,740
 first robot thing.

570
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:12,620
 So in the last month, Prince Andrew has opened a business club in Hungate.

571
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:17,740
 He has opened a luxury bed factory in Castle Donington and around about in Kent named after

572
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:22,460
 him has caught fire.

573
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,340
 So we're going to wrap up very shortly.

574
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:27,660
 There were a bunch of stories that we really wanted to talk about tonight as our headline

575
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,500
 topics, but we didn't get time.

576
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:33,220
 So just very quickly, could you just let us know Jane's Andy and Anna what you would have

577
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,220
 gone for tonight?

578
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,220
 I can't.

579
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:39,260
 One that we didn't get a chance to say is this one, which is new research, reveals that

580
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:48,460
 the 20% of Americans are put off by the word moist, moist.

581
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,460
 Anyone?

582
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,460
 Moist.

583
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:53,860
 Definitely a few people over there.

584
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,820
 Anna, what do you got?

585
00:29:55,820 --> 00:30:01,980
 I like this that after a man in Croydon lost a bet with a friend, the frozen food company

586
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:12,700
 Iceland has warned shoppers not to lie down in their freezers to cool off.

587
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,420
 And finally, Andy?

588
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:19,060
 In China, under new guidelines from the Ministry of Culture, live streaming services have

589
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:24,420
 banned the eating of bananas in a neurotic manner.

590
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:31,060
 But someone, an unnamed Chinese person, has to have said they will eat yams instead.

591
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,060
 OK, that's it.

592
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,540
 That is all of our facts.

593
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,020
 Thank you so much for being here tonight.

594
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,420
 Thank you all for watching at home.

595
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:39,460
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us about the things we've said over the course

596
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:43,780
 of this podcast, we can be found on no such thing as the news.com where you can see all

597
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:47,180
 the stories we're talking about tonight, as well as additional stories that didn't make

598
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,180
 it into the show.

599
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:51,740
 We will be back again next week with another batch of our favorite news stories from the

600
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,740
 past seven days.

601
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,740
 We'll see you then.

602
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,740
 Goodbye.

603
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,740
 [APPLAUSE]

604
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,740
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

605
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,740
 [APPLAUSE]

606
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:03,320
 (upbeat music)

607
