00:00:00,00:00:04,One welcome to another episode and no such thing as a fish.
00:00:04,00:00:06,We have a very exciting day ahead of us.
00:00:06,00:00:10,We are on our way to the studio to record the very first episode of no such thing as the
00:00:10,00:00:11,news.
00:00:11,00:00:18,It's our BBC 2 TV show and it's going to air May 20th at 11.05 pm on BBC 2.
00:00:18,00:00:20,So we need you guys to watch it.
00:00:20,00:00:23,"We really need you to watch it because if you don't watch it, they'll cancel us."
00:00:23,00:00:25,We will lose the entire series.
00:00:25,00:00:29,"So please, if you like our show, if you're hearing this now, cancel your Friday night plans"
00:00:29,00:00:34,"and come to the TV, sit down, make yourself some tea and watch our show."
00:00:34,00:00:37,We'd really appreciate it and please spread the word.
00:00:37,00:00:41,"If you want to watch it on I Player a little bit later, that is also okay with us."
00:00:41,00:00:45,Just watch it at some point and you can go to the no such thing as a fish YouTube channel
00:00:45,00:00:48,and catch it there anytime from Sunday morning.
00:00:48,00:00:53,The episode you're about to hear now is the on-ed pilot which we recorded last week.
00:00:53,00:00:54,So enjoy.
00:00:54,00:01:17,Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as the news coming to you from
00:01:17,00:01:19,up the Crete Comby Club in Greenwich London.
00:01:19,00:01:23,"My name is Dan Schreiber and please welcome it's Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and"
00:01:23,00:01:33,James Harkin.
00:01:33,00:01:36,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our favourite facts from"
00:01:36,00:01:43,"the last seven days of news and in no particular order, here we go, starting with you, Chazinski."
00:01:43,00:01:47,My fact this week is that the first thing that Ted Cruz did after dropping it out of the
00:01:47,00:01:52,Republican contest was Elba's wife in the face.
00:01:52,00:01:57,"And this was so you probably saw that about a week ago, Ted Cruz dropped out the Republican"
00:01:57,00:02:05,race leaving Donald Trump as the only contender for the throne of America.
00:02:05,00:02:07,"And yeah, it's just a great YouTube clip."
00:02:07,00:02:08,You should watch it.
00:02:08,00:02:11,He makes this speech in Indiana saying he's very sorry but he seems to have not gone that
00:02:11,00:02:12,well for him.
00:02:12,00:02:13,He turns away from the microphone.
00:02:13,00:02:18,Elba's his wife in the face as he's hugging his dad and then he sort of tries to compensate
00:02:18,00:02:22,for it by then trying to do a three-way hug with his dad and his wife and then sort of
00:02:22,00:02:26,slaps her about a bit as he goes back to do that.
00:02:26,00:02:28,And that was just seemed like an awkward end to an awkward campaign.
00:02:28,00:02:33,"I think he's got a very unfortunate time, Ted Cruz."
00:02:33,00:02:40,"First of all, Donald Trump made a reference to JFK's killing and accused Cruz at some point"
00:02:40,00:02:43,of having done in a photo with Lee Harvey Oswald to release.
00:02:43,00:02:44,I don't know.
00:02:44,00:02:45,I don't know.
00:02:45,00:02:46,"He was far, sorry."
00:02:46,00:02:48,He's just far though of being a photo of Lee Harvey Oswald.
00:02:48,00:02:49,Yeah.
00:02:49,00:02:50,So he's the spawn of the murderer.
00:02:50,00:02:54,And then everyone in America seems to think that he is the zodiac killer.
00:02:54,00:03:00,Even though his first murder was committed two years before Cruz was born.
00:03:00,00:03:05,"I find it like there was, he had a non-line story that had lots of odd products."
00:03:05,00:03:09,"If you were trying to eventually run for president, you wouldn't naturally have."
00:03:09,00:03:14,There was this one debate that he had with Donald Trump where he started telling Donald Trump
00:03:14,00:03:15,to breathe.
00:03:15,00:03:16,"And Trump was like, ""Well, you breathe."
00:03:16,00:03:17,I'm breathing.
00:03:17,00:03:18,"Why can't you breathe?"""
00:03:18,00:03:19,"And he was like, ""Oh, I'm breathing."
00:03:19,00:03:20,"Why don't you breathe?"""
00:03:20,00:03:23,"They just had this real kind of like, breathe-off kind of conversation."
00:03:23,00:03:27,"And then Rubio comes in and he's like, ""When you guys are done doing yoga."""
00:03:27,00:03:29,And it's like these weird calls.
00:03:29,00:03:35,"And then so, Ted Cruz, then a few days later, for 35 bucks on his website, you could buy"
00:03:35,00:03:42,the Ted Cruz Breathe Exercise Matt that you would just learn to breathe better on.
00:03:42,00:03:46,So he was just running with these gangs and then he got sued by a company who are a yoga
00:03:46,00:03:51,company who are called Breathe saying you can't suddenly start selling Breathe Yoga Matt on
00:03:51,00:03:52,your website.
00:03:52,00:03:54,So he had to take the whole Breathe thing away.
00:03:54,00:03:57,"So then he just was selling Exercise Matt, you know?"
00:03:57,00:04:02,"Just for no reason, it's just why not get an Exercise Matt of mine?"
00:04:02,00:04:06,"It's the whole joke, I guess we're now selling Exercise Matt."
00:04:06,00:04:14,"So it looks now it's going to be Trump versus Clinton, right, in the American presidential"
00:04:14,00:04:15,race.
00:04:15,00:04:19,"And it means it's going to be the most unpopular presidential candidates in my lifetime,"
00:04:19,00:04:26,"versus the second most popular candidate in my lifetime, and by a long, long way as well."
00:04:26,00:04:27,Yeah.
00:04:27,00:04:32,"I think PJ walked, tweeted a couple of days ago that this came out in support for Hillary"
00:04:32,00:04:36,"and it was a story and the tweet was everyone vote for Hillary, it's the second worst thing"
00:04:36,00:04:41,that could possibly happen to the world.
00:04:41,00:04:46,There was a poll this week by the public policy poll and they like tested how popular Donald
00:04:46,00:04:52,Trump is compared to various different things and it turned out that he is less popular than
00:04:52,00:05:04,"the traffic jams, used car salesmen, hipsters, jury duty, the band's nickel back, root canal"
00:05:04,00:05:08,surgery and lice.
00:05:08,00:05:12,"There's another on Ted Cruz's website, there's another product that he sold, which is a thing"
00:05:12,00:05:16,"that he started, a kind of what he was trying to guess to be a kind of meme going round,"
00:05:16,00:05:19,"which is about, he called it Trump or Tantrum."
00:05:19,00:05:23,"So the idea is, every time Donald Trump was throwing a tantrum, he was like, it's a Trump"
00:05:23,00:05:27,"or a tantrum and I looked at just the basic words and you think, why didn't you just call"
00:05:27,00:05:30,it a tantrum?
00:05:30,00:05:32,And I don't trust someone who doesn't recognise a good pun.
00:05:32,00:05:33,So...
00:05:33,00:05:36,Do you know how to tell if he's angry actually?
00:05:36,00:05:37,Donald Trump.
00:05:37,00:05:38,Yeah.
00:05:38,00:05:39,No.
00:05:39,00:05:42,"He, as I'm talking about, he starts building walls, he wears a red hat when he's angry."
00:05:42,00:05:48,"This is according to his butler, who I think wrote a book a couple of months ago, a few"
00:05:48,00:05:52,months ago and said that the way to tell his mood is by the colour of hat that he's wearing
00:05:52,00:05:57,"and when he's pissed off, he wears a red hat and that is when to leave Iran."
00:05:57,00:06:02,"So there's a fit, this is the American elections."
00:06:02,00:06:05,We have the British local elections this week.
00:06:05,00:06:08,"I was a few funny, amusing things that happened there."
00:06:08,00:06:13,"In Wolverhampton, the Conservative Party accidentally put two people up for elections, so they"
00:06:13,00:06:15,came first and third.
00:06:15,00:06:16,Welcome.
00:06:16,00:06:19,"Yeah, but the thing is, they took votes off each other."
00:06:19,00:06:23,"So one of them said no, no vote for him, vote for him but people didn't really pay any attention."
00:06:23,00:06:28,"And if the guy who came third got just 60 more votes, then Labour would have gotten."
00:06:28,00:06:33,"And also, there's election going on in the Philippines at the moment with the most unbelievably"
00:06:33,00:06:41,weird man who's just wanted and his campaign slogan is basically I will kill all the criminals.
00:06:41,00:06:51,"Well, do we go Duterte or Duterte, or the Punisher, as they call it."
00:06:51,00:06:55,"It is Duterte, I think, because his nickname and his old job was Duterte Harry."
00:06:55,00:06:58,"Oh, see, that is a good pun."
00:06:58,00:07:01,Ted Cruz could learn something up there.
00:07:01,00:07:02,And that's how he got into power.
00:07:02,00:07:08,"In an interview, many are asking what my credentials are and what I can do for the Philippines."
00:07:08,00:07:11,They're telling me that they have heard I will womanize her.
00:07:11,00:07:13,That is true.
00:07:13,00:07:17,That is very true.
00:07:17,00:07:21,"He said, well, in a press conference, he just said that."
00:07:21,00:07:25,"He's point, he's voted about his multiple affairs and the fact he uses a lot of my anger"
00:07:25,00:07:26,to keep himself going.
00:07:26,00:07:28,He's voted about his my anger use.
00:07:28,00:07:31,"Yeah, it's very confident, isn't it?"
00:07:31,00:07:37,You wait till you see the pills I have to take to sustain this.
00:07:37,00:07:45,"He's got an advertising contact with his side, but yeah, he's reassured the public after"
00:07:45,00:07:49,"boasting that all his affairs, that his mistresses won't cost the public a lot because he keeps"
00:07:49,00:07:56,them in sheen boarding house and he takes up to short stay hotels for sex.
00:07:56,00:07:57,He's quite a character.
00:07:57,00:08:02,"He's like one of these strong men, kind of presidents, that kind of coming in around the"
00:08:02,00:08:03,world.
00:08:03,00:08:04,I think he's one of those kind of guys.
00:08:04,00:08:05,Right.
00:08:05,00:08:07,We need to move on to our final facts soon.
00:08:07,00:08:08,So anyone got anything before we do?
00:08:08,00:08:12,Can I just quickly relate one thing about the recent UK election?
00:08:12,00:08:13,Yeah.
00:08:13,00:08:19,"In case you missed it, there was a Labour counsellor called Duncan N. Wright and he wanted"
00:08:19,00:08:24,to be the counsellor for Whitney in the West Oxfordshire area and he sent a tweet out after
00:08:24,00:08:29,"the elections just saying, lost by 70 votes or so, thanks for the opportunity to serve."
00:08:29,00:08:35,"The fight goes on and then about 20 minutes later he sent another tweet saying, actually,"
00:08:35,00:08:38,"it turns out I won, fondle of my votes under a Tory pile."
00:08:38,00:08:39,"Thanks, Whitney."
00:08:39,00:08:43,"And they just, that's how casual voting is in this country."
00:08:43,00:08:47,"Oh, we found a bunch more votes under this pile of paper."
00:08:47,00:08:48,Sorry.
00:08:48,00:08:51,The fight can stop immediately.
00:08:51,00:08:53,All right.
00:08:53,00:08:54,So there we have it.
00:08:54,00:08:57,"Ted Cruz, accidentally, elbows his wife in the face."
00:08:57,00:09:01,Now we are moving on to our second fact of the show and that is my fact.
00:09:01,00:09:06,My fact this week is that this week scientists have discovered that we still haven't discovered
00:09:06,00:09:11,99.99% of life on Earth.
00:09:11,00:09:12,That's a lot.
00:09:12,00:09:18,"Now, the big story that was in the news this week about this is that there's an estimate"
00:09:18,00:09:22,"of how much life on Earth there is and it changes all the time, but it's quite manageable"
00:09:22,00:09:24,in a way for counting purposes.
00:09:24,00:09:30,"So in 2011, they thought there was about 8.7 million different forms of life on the planet."
00:09:30,00:09:33,They just found out through this new study that they reckoned that that number has gone
00:09:33,00:09:42,"up from 8.7 million to one trillion, one trillion, what are these things that we haven't?"
00:09:42,00:09:43,They found it.
00:09:43,00:09:48,There's a lot of sports to be had.
00:09:48,00:09:50,"Is it very, very small things that we haven't?"
00:09:50,00:09:51,"Yeah, it's microbes."
00:09:51,00:09:52,It's microbes.
00:09:52,00:09:57,What they did is there's a way of kind of working things out called scaling laws and say
00:09:57,00:10:03,"you know how big an animal is, you can kind of tell what its metabolism is and if the"
00:10:03,00:10:06,"bigger it is, the more it is, so you can put the size of the animal in it and you can work"
00:10:06,00:10:07,out its metabolism.
00:10:07,00:10:11,That's an example of things and another way of doing this is you can work out how many big
00:10:11,00:10:16,"animals there are in an area and then by putting them into an equation, you can work out"
00:10:16,00:10:20,how many microbes or how many small animals there are as well and so they've worked out how
00:10:20,00:10:24,many big animals they think there are and they've put it into the scaling equation and
00:10:24,00:10:25,they've come out with one trillion.
00:10:25,00:10:30,"We just don't know, I mean they are making this up, I think."
00:10:30,00:10:31,That's true.
00:10:31,00:10:34,They said that there's between 100 billion and 1 trillion.
00:10:34,00:10:40,So that is actually quite a large gap between those two numbers if you think about it.
00:10:40,00:10:43,"Don't think about it, just let me know."
00:10:43,00:10:44,It is amazing.
00:10:44,00:10:48,The difference between a billion and a trillion is it's a number that I'm unable properly
00:10:48,00:10:49,to understand.
00:10:49,00:10:51,So I started thinking about it.
00:10:51,00:10:55,"I first thought, okay, everyone always has this dream of having a species named after"
00:10:55,00:10:56,them.
00:10:56,00:10:59,"So I thought, well, if there's a trillion surely there's enough for us all, right, to go around."
00:10:59,00:11:00,So I looked into it.
00:11:00,00:11:01,And more than enough.
00:11:01,00:11:02,"Yeah, exactly."
00:11:02,00:11:06,"So I looked into how many people have existed on earth ever, all the dead people, all the"
00:11:06,00:11:11,"living people combined and apparently according to the population reference of euro, they estimate"
00:11:11,00:11:18,"that about 107 billion people have ever existed, which means that's a bit less than a trillion"
00:11:18,00:11:20,so we could do it.
00:11:20,00:11:24,"And that's really, that's insane, the differentiation of life on our planet."
00:11:24,00:11:28,"Yeah, but most of those people don't want some crappy bit of bacteria named after them."
00:11:28,00:11:32,"They want a large mammal, a large, ambitious mammal."
00:11:32,00:11:34,That's what's so disappointing about this.
00:11:34,00:11:35,You hear this fact?
00:11:35,00:11:38,"You're like brilliant lions everywhere, different species of lions."
00:11:38,00:11:41,"Oh good, it's tiny microbes again."
00:11:41,00:11:43,They're probably really interesting.
00:11:43,00:11:48,"You're probably, you're probably being specious against these microbes."
00:11:48,00:11:49,They're probably very interesting.
00:11:49,00:11:52,"And I think you could probably, because I don't know actually what a microve is, but I"
00:11:52,00:11:55,reckon.
00:11:55,00:11:57,I reckon they're probably interesting when you look close at them.
00:11:57,00:12:00,Do you know the largest species that we discovered last year?
00:12:00,00:12:01,No.
00:12:01,00:12:02,The largest new species.
00:12:02,00:12:03,I can find.
00:12:03,00:12:07,So there were 2034 new plant species discovered last year alone.
00:12:07,00:12:13,"And the biggest was a tree, a gulbertio dendron maximum, which gets up to 45 meters high and"
00:12:13,00:12:14,we hadn't found it before.
00:12:14,00:12:15,Wow.
00:12:15,00:12:16,Good was that?
00:12:16,00:12:17,No matter.
00:12:17,00:12:18,It was great.
00:12:18,00:12:21,Was there anything behind this slightly bigger tree?
00:12:21,00:12:23,"No, it was hiding in Gabon."
00:12:23,00:12:24,Oh really?
00:12:24,00:12:27,"Also, last year, the first ever animal found on Facebook."
00:12:27,00:12:28,What do you mean?
00:12:28,00:12:29,"No, sorry, it was an insect eating plant."
00:12:29,00:12:32,I think it was identified because someone saw it on Facebook.
00:12:32,00:12:33,I don't think it had an account.
00:12:33,00:12:34,It's going to happen.
00:12:34,00:12:35,"No, mutual friends?"
00:12:35,00:12:36,Who was the star?
00:12:36,00:12:37,What was really cool about that?
00:12:37,00:12:38,I saw that article.
00:12:38,00:12:49,And it was basically a guy found this plant and he put a picture of it on.
00:12:49,00:12:52,"And then he had a friend, I think, who saw it and thought, that's something new."
00:12:52,00:12:56,But what's great about it is because the photo was geotagged.
00:12:56,00:12:57,They knew exactly where it was.
00:12:57,00:13:02,So they could go and find it and they could check it out and find out that it actually was
00:13:02,00:13:03,a real new plant.
00:13:03,00:13:04,Yes.
00:13:04,00:13:05,"It's really cool, isn't it?"
00:13:05,00:13:06,I love it.
00:13:06,00:13:09,I think maybe social media isn't such a mistake after all.
00:13:09,00:13:12,"Actually, I think it's a secret categorising."
00:13:12,00:13:13,It's like the finding.
00:13:13,00:13:14,There's a fun part.
00:13:14,00:13:17,But then they're all sitting in museums or botanical gardens waiting for some point
00:13:17,00:13:19,in turn to put them in a list.
00:13:19,00:13:20,That's true.
00:13:20,00:13:22,"And that's where the hold-up is, I reckon."
00:13:22,00:13:23,That's true.
00:13:23,00:13:27,"2014, a new species that was discovered that was collected by Darwin."
00:13:27,00:13:28,"Like, that's how."
00:13:28,00:13:29,Wow.
00:13:29,00:13:30,Yeah.
00:13:30,00:13:34,"So in the Natural History Museum, every week, they discover about 50 new different species"
00:13:34,00:13:35,because they're going through the backlog.
00:13:35,00:13:37,So they still haven't gone through all of Darwin's stuff.
00:13:37,00:13:40,"And they keep going through and going, oh my god, this is a new beetle."
00:13:40,00:13:42,Surely you bump that up to the top of the list.
00:13:42,00:13:44,That was finished Darwin.
00:13:44,00:13:45,Yeah.
00:13:45,00:13:50,"Oh, I've been looking up a few things about David Attenborough because he's a man who has a lot of things"
00:13:50,00:13:51,named after him.
00:13:51,00:13:52,New species.
00:13:52,00:13:53,And a lot of species and things like that.
00:13:53,00:13:54,"And, obviously, news this week."
00:13:54,00:13:55,Hot news.
00:13:55,00:13:56,No one's ever coming.
00:13:56,00:13:57,His birthday.
00:13:57,00:13:58,Yeah.
00:13:58,00:13:59,Who knew.
00:13:59,00:14:00,Thanks.
00:14:00,00:14:02,We'll pass that on.
00:14:02,00:14:10,Pass on that incredibly half-hearted audience reaction.
00:14:10,00:14:11,How old is he?
00:14:11,00:14:12,He's 90.
00:14:12,00:14:22,"I found out this thing about him that in 2011, he sold 132-year-old murder in a sense."
00:14:22,00:14:25,There was a murder that happened in 1879.
00:14:25,00:14:31,"And it was a woman called Julia Martha Thomas, who was killed by her housekeeper."
00:14:31,00:14:36,It was called Kate Webster and Webster was arrested and she was tried and she was convicted
00:14:36,00:14:38,and then executed.
00:14:38,00:14:42,But one thing it was never found was the murdered woman's head.
00:14:42,00:14:47,And this was found in David Attenborough's garden when he was having an extension done to his
00:14:47,00:14:48,home.
00:14:48,00:14:49,Where is this?
00:14:49,00:14:50,2011.
00:14:50,00:14:51,And the murder was in 1879.
00:14:51,00:14:52,OK.
00:14:52,00:14:53,So it was 213-year-old.
00:14:53,00:14:54,And he's only 90.
00:14:54,00:14:56,So he's not in the frame.
00:14:56,00:14:57,So he plays.
00:14:57,00:14:58,Imagine that scoop.
00:14:58,00:14:59,He's incredible.
00:14:59,00:15:00,Yeah.
00:15:00,00:15:09,Wow.
00:15:09,00:15:10,David.
00:15:10,00:15:14,So well done him for having an extension done.
00:15:14,00:15:15,Also well done.
00:15:15,00:15:16,Clevver David.
00:15:16,00:15:17,Yeah.
00:15:17,00:15:18,Also well done him.
00:15:18,00:15:26,"I think he's probably proud of that, but when he was 89, so not long ago, he became…"
00:15:26,00:15:30,So what does that say?
00:15:30,00:15:34,He broke the record for the deepest anyone's dive on the Great Barrier Reef.
00:15:34,00:15:39,"So he went down a thousand feet on the Great Barrier Reef in a submersible, with a person"
00:15:39,00:15:41,who knew how to drive a submersible.
00:15:41,00:15:42,It was brilliant.
00:15:42,00:15:43,I just think that's incredible.
00:15:43,00:15:44,And there's footage of him doing it.
00:15:44,00:15:45,He looks so comfortable.
00:15:45,00:15:46,And he said it was brilliant.
00:15:46,00:15:47,He wasn't nervous at all.
00:15:47,00:15:49,It was like being in a cinema or something.
00:15:49,00:15:50,You're in absolute comfort.
00:15:50,00:15:56,"You're just in there, munching chocolate and saying, ""This is wonderful."""
00:15:56,00:15:59,"Oh, of course it looks to him at the same time."
00:15:59,00:16:00,It's just wonderful.
00:16:00,00:16:01,Just incredible.
00:16:01,00:16:04,It's not meant to be white.
00:16:04,00:16:09,That's what I was thinking about the bear.
00:16:09,00:16:14,It's a thing about the grizzly bear.
00:16:14,00:16:22,"When I was looking for stuff about Leicester City, I was reading the Leicester Mercury and"
00:16:22,00:16:23,they had a headline.
00:16:23,00:16:25,It was today in the Leicester Mercury.
00:16:25,00:16:31,"It said, ""Should East Midlands Airport be renamed after Sir David Attenborough?"""
00:16:31,00:16:37,And I think we should let the internet decide.
00:16:37,00:16:39,"You're pretty angry about Boatham at Boatface, right, Andy?"
00:16:39,00:16:42,"You have come down in the month, isn't it?"
00:16:42,00:16:46,"Well, you think we can why you want to go down?"
00:16:46,00:16:49,Obviously they've named Boat now after Sir David Attenborough instead.
00:16:49,00:16:50,Don't worry.
00:16:50,00:16:51,Boatham at Boatface still survives.
00:16:51,00:16:54,It's a remotely operated vehicle aboard David Attenborough.
00:16:54,00:16:56,"Yeah, it's a..."
00:16:56,00:16:57,"Yeah, they've been..."
00:16:57,00:16:59,They've installed it on him.
00:16:59,00:17:02,"It's a submarine, which it looks really beautiful."
00:17:02,00:17:04,There was quite finally...
00:17:04,00:17:09,"There was a petition on, I think it was, ""Change.org"" for David Attenborough to change his"
00:17:09,00:17:12,name now to Boatface.
00:17:12,00:17:14,Yeah.
00:17:14,00:17:15,"But, yeah, he's also the only person..."
00:17:15,00:17:16,"I just love this, David Attenborough."
00:17:16,00:17:21,"In fact, he's the only person to have received a BAFTA in five different formats."
00:17:21,00:17:27,"So he's received BAFTAs in black and white, colour, HD, 3D and 4K TV."
00:17:27,00:17:31,"And even though no one knows what 4K TV is, that's still cool."
00:17:31,00:17:33,It's just extremely high resolution television.
00:17:33,00:17:35,"But, great work, David."
00:17:35,00:17:36,Yeah.
00:17:36,00:17:38,We need to move on very shortly to our next facts.
00:17:38,00:17:39,Have we got anything else before we do?
00:17:39,00:17:43,I can quickly tell you about a video that I saw in YouTube if you want to.
00:17:43,00:17:47,"So, is this fisherman in Australia called Roddled Honey Set?"
00:17:47,00:17:48,And he was in Australia.
00:17:48,00:17:49,And you can see the video.
00:17:49,00:17:54,"And there's this little thing floating around, and he's like, ""Is it, I think it might be"
00:17:54,00:17:57,"a sea slug, or is it a new species of jellyfish?"""
00:17:57,00:18:01,And so he put it onto YouTube to see if people will be able to tell what it was.
00:18:01,00:18:05,And they pretty quickly managed to identify it as a rather large poop.
00:18:05,00:18:07,[laughter]
00:18:07,00:18:08,Amazing.
00:18:08,00:18:09,[laughter]
00:18:09,00:18:12,"And, who did their name enough?"
00:18:12,00:18:13,[laughter]
00:18:13,00:18:14,"Okay, look."
00:18:14,00:18:15,We need to move on.
00:18:15,00:18:19,We need to move on to our third fact of the evening.
00:18:19,00:18:22,And that is Jane Tarkin.
00:18:22,00:18:27,"Okay, my fact this week is that, as well as winning the Premier League title, the owners"
00:18:27,00:18:32,of Leicester City also won the World Elephant Polo Championships.
00:18:32,00:18:33,[laughter]
00:18:33,00:18:36,And no one is talking about that.
00:18:36,00:18:37,"Oh, no."
00:18:37,00:18:38,What's going on?
00:18:38,00:18:41,"What, what, what, what versatile men they are."
00:18:41,00:18:42,[laughter]
00:18:42,00:18:44,"And, does anyone go?"
00:18:44,00:18:45,Srivitana Brothers.
00:18:45,00:18:46,Okay.
00:18:46,00:18:49,"They bought Leicester City, but they've also done another few different kind of spots."
00:18:49,00:18:53,"And they've really got a polo, and as well as being really good at polo, they're really"
00:18:53,00:18:54,good at Elephant Polo.
00:18:54,00:18:59,And this year they're giving loads of money to people who are really good at polo.
00:18:59,00:19:00,They are going to polo.
00:19:00,00:19:04,"The vice chairman is called Iowa, and he's one of the players on the beating for the horse"
00:19:04,00:19:05,polo.
00:19:05,00:19:06,So they put the...
00:19:06,00:19:07,Give it not the elephant polo.
00:19:07,00:19:08,Not the elephant polo.
00:19:08,00:19:09,[laughter]
00:19:09,00:19:13,"And I read that Miss Thailand competes in the Elephant Polo, so I don't know how high"
00:19:13,00:19:14,the standards are.
00:19:14,00:19:15,You knew that.
00:19:15,00:19:17,Is that her talent round?
00:19:17,00:19:18,[laughter]
00:19:18,00:19:19,Right.
00:19:19,00:19:21,"Actually, Elephant Polo started off as a bit of a joke."
00:19:21,00:19:25,It was invented by two British guys in the '90s or the '80s.
00:19:25,00:19:28,"They kind of thought it was just a funny thing to do, but then now it's kind of become a much"
00:19:28,00:19:32,"bigger thing, and it's a charity event, a little bit controversial."
00:19:32,00:19:35,"They make a load of money, and they give it to elephant charities."
00:19:35,00:19:41,"But also, there was an activist called Leicchiliart from Thailand, who said Elephant and not made"
00:19:41,00:19:42,for polo.
00:19:42,00:19:43,[laughter]
00:19:43,00:19:45,It would be a perverse god.
00:19:45,00:19:46,[laughter]
00:19:46,00:19:48,"It's true, it's true."
00:19:48,00:19:51,"He's quite an eccentric man, Rani Aries, isn't he?"
00:19:51,00:19:52,So that's the manager of Wester.
00:19:52,00:19:53,"Yes, that's the manager."
00:19:53,00:19:56,"Who, at the start of the season, he was the book he's favourite to be the first manager"
00:19:56,00:19:57,in the premiership to be sat?
00:19:57,00:19:58,I read.
00:19:58,00:20:02,I think this is a guardian that said he's an eccentric who offered a win bonus of pizza
00:20:02,00:20:05,at a local restaurant to incentivise his players.
00:20:05,00:20:06,[laughter]
00:20:06,00:20:09,"So he is that kind of, like, unattainable prize."
00:20:09,00:20:10,[laughter]
00:20:10,00:20:11,You know what I'm saying?
00:20:11,00:20:12,You know what I'm saying?
00:20:12,00:20:18,"Um, he also, he used to rally them with his cry of dilly-ding, dilly-dong."
00:20:18,00:20:22,"And when asked why that was the cry that he rallyed them with, he said it was because he couldn't"
00:20:22,00:20:24,"sing, so he pretended to be a bell instead."
00:20:24,00:20:25,[laughter]
00:20:25,00:20:32,"Well, I think they achieved that, and my favourite thing definitely, looking into the"
00:20:32,00:20:38,"story, is the fact that because they're a Thai family, they massively subscribe to Buddhism."
00:20:38,00:20:42,"And so they were flying over for every home game, monks to come and bless the team."
00:20:42,00:20:46,They would slap Jamie Variety and the rest of the team players' legs with these lashes
00:20:46,00:20:50,"that they were blessing them with, and while the team was out there, they sat back a bunch"
00:20:50,00:20:55,"of monks chanting away, kind of guessing how the game was going based on the cheers, and"
00:20:55,00:20:59,"just chanting away for their, to bless the team to win."
00:20:59,00:21:03,"They planted relics underneath the pitch, so the whole thing, it's extraordinary, it's"
00:21:03,00:21:10,"incredible. Honestly, it's a massive Buddhist monk victory this whole season."
00:21:10,00:21:11,[laughter]
00:21:11,00:21:12,"It's incredible, isn't it?"
00:21:12,00:21:15,"He built them a temple, I think, or a shrine."
00:21:15,00:21:20,"Apparently, as someone who worked at the club, I think one of the chefs said that the pitch"
00:21:20,00:21:24,"was full of covered in white marks from where the monks kept on blessing it, and they"
00:21:24,00:21:26,don't know how they're blessing it.
00:21:26,00:21:27,[laughter]
00:21:27,00:21:37,And I'm not just that. [laughter]
00:21:37,00:21:41,"So a lot of the stories about Leicester win the title is how they were 5,000 to one at the"
00:21:41,00:21:46,"start of the year, so I thought I'd look at a few things about odds and things like that."
00:21:46,00:21:51,"Two guys, Skelly and Justin Tomlinson, who if either of them becomes Prime Minister, they're"
00:21:51,00:21:56,"going to get 500,000 pounds, and that's because they put a bet on when they're at university"
00:21:56,00:22:01,"at 10,000 to one that they would become Prime Minister, and they're both currently Conservative"
00:22:01,00:22:02,MPs.
00:22:02,00:22:03,[laughter]
00:22:03,00:22:10,"There was another thing that I saw that a lot of people put a bet on them becoming 100,"
00:22:10,00:22:14,"turning 100, and the way that they work out the odds on that is they take your age, subtract"
00:22:14,00:22:17,"it from 100, and that's the odds."
00:22:17,00:22:24,"So if I'm, what am I, 37, so that would mean that I would be 63 to 1 to reach 100, and"
00:22:24,00:22:25,that's how they work it out.
00:22:25,00:22:26,[laughter]
00:22:26,00:22:27,"Okay, well that's it."
00:22:27,00:22:31,"That is Leicester, also the elephant polo owners, which is amazing."
00:22:31,00:22:33,The champions of the world in two different sports.
00:22:33,00:22:38,"Let's move on to our final fact of the show, and that is Andrew Hunter Murray."
00:22:38,00:22:44,My fact is that Britain's first ever robot was designed to replace the Duke of York.
00:22:44,00:22:45,[laughter]
00:22:45,00:22:50,"So, this is in the news, because it's a robot that we lost."
00:22:50,00:22:51,We don't know where it went.
00:22:51,00:22:56,"It was in 1928, it was built, and there's a campaign, the Science Museum of Launching, to rebuild"
00:22:56,00:22:57,it.
00:22:57,00:23:00,"They've got the designs, and they want to make a new one, so I think there's a Kickstarter."
00:23:00,00:23:03,But this is the most incredible robot.
00:23:03,00:23:10,"It was called Eric, and it was in 1928, the Duke of York was meant to open an exhibition"
00:23:10,00:23:15,"for the Society of Model Engineers, and then he dropped out, and so the guy was organising"
00:23:15,00:23:20,"the exhibition, said, ""Well, we need a replacement,"" and he and an engineer, and he made one, and it stood"
00:23:20,00:23:26,"up on the day, and it made a four-minute speech, and it looked around, and it answered questions,"
00:23:26,00:23:31,"and its teeth were sparking, because there were 35,000 volts of electricity going through them."
00:23:31,00:23:32,[laughter]
00:23:32,00:23:36,"And then Eric just went on tour around the world, and huge audiences came to see him, and"
00:23:36,00:23:38,that we have no idea where he went in the end.
00:23:38,00:23:41,"Do you think the audience has been warned that there had been a change in booking it, or"
00:23:41,00:23:43,"before that, I'd go like the Duke of York thinking, ""Where?"""
00:23:43,00:23:44,[laughter]
00:23:44,00:23:51,"So this, just to clarify, this is a science museum Kickstarter. The science museum of London"
00:23:51,00:23:56,"has actually set this up, and what they've had is they've found not Eric himself, the robot."
00:23:56,00:24:00,"They've found the plans of the robots, and the idea is that they now want to refund it,"
00:24:00,00:24:05,"send him back around the world to talk to people, I guess, I don't quite know, but they're"
00:24:05,00:24:10,"opening up quite a similar kind of robotic exhibition, so they thought let's get Eric back"
00:24:10,00:24:11,on the scene.
00:24:11,00:24:13,"Yeah, they're rebuilding a lot, I think, aren't they?"
00:24:13,00:24:19,"I read an article in the Sunland Daily Echo from the 1930s, and they said that Eric was"
00:24:19,00:24:21,the perfect husband.
00:24:21,00:24:26,"Eric should prove the idol of all the girls, he never swers, does not stay out late at night"
00:24:26,00:24:28,in his truest steal.
00:24:28,00:24:33,"Like a good boy, he speaks when he's spoken to, and confesses he cannot think."
00:24:33,00:24:34,[laughter]
00:24:34,00:24:35,That's fantastic.
00:24:35,00:24:36,"Yeah, but he, because this was--"
00:24:36,00:24:48,"You saw all of his women in cheekboarding houses, in short-stay hotels, and you should see"
00:24:48,00:24:51,how much viagre he got.
00:24:51,00:24:56,"Yeah, he was, so he said he was built in, did you say where he was built, 1928, wasn't"
00:24:56,00:24:57,it?
00:24:57,00:25:01,"But when you look at the newspaper archives, it seems in the '30s and '40s, he became"
00:25:01,00:25:05,"really popular, and I checked the popularity of the name Eric."
00:25:05,00:25:08,And Eric was not very popular in the '20s at all.
00:25:08,00:25:14,"And then in, so in 1928, there were only 186 Eric's born in Britain, but by 1948, there were"
00:25:14,00:25:19,"two and a half thousand, and by 1958, there were more than 8,000."
00:25:19,00:25:23,So I record that Eric might have caused the popularity of the name Eric.
00:25:23,00:25:24,Oh my God.
00:25:24,00:25:25,It's so good.
00:25:25,00:25:26,Sorry.
00:25:26,00:25:27,Very good.
00:25:27,00:25:32,"He was, so I've got a rival article to yours, from the newspaper archives, and I haven't"
00:25:32,00:25:35,"done much paper it was from, but must have been a rival paper, because that said that he is"
00:25:35,00:25:40,as unattractive as any steel figure you've ever seen.
00:25:40,00:25:44,"And he is, if you look at pictures, but they were going to build an assistant, this article"
00:25:44,00:25:45,said.
00:25:45,00:25:49,"So it promised that they say his sister, who is now in production, is to be beautiful."
00:25:49,00:25:52,She's like one of the figures in West End Store Windows.
00:25:52,00:25:55,And I couldn't find anything more of the sister's manufacture.
00:25:55,00:25:58,"So Eric's sister, beautiful sister, maybe out there."
00:25:58,00:26:01,I read about another robot that was in the news this week.
00:26:01,00:26:04,So you have a loan of robots kind of stud next to each other.
00:26:04,00:26:06,They're only like six inches tall or something.
00:26:06,00:26:10,And they're kind of communicating to each other in their own little language.
00:26:10,00:26:15,"And whenever they notice that a human's coming by, they'll turn round and they'll go, oh,"
00:26:15,00:26:16,hello.
00:26:16,00:26:17,What do you think?
00:26:17,00:26:21,"And then whatever you say to them, they go, oh, that's interesting."
00:26:21,00:26:23,And they turn round and they carry on their little conversation.
00:26:23,00:26:29,"They don't understand anything that human says, but it's just a way of kind of pretending"
00:26:29,00:26:30,to be interested in humans.
00:26:30,00:26:35,So that is genuinely a push now for any robot or AI that they're trying to do.
00:26:35,00:26:38,They're trying to get them to be better with humans and be more understanding.
00:26:38,00:26:40,I was reading that's a Google for the past few months.
00:26:40,00:26:44,"They've just spoken about this this week, but this has been going on for two months or"
00:26:44,00:26:45,so.
00:26:45,00:26:46,They have been feeding.
00:26:46,00:26:47,So they have a bunch of AI computers.
00:26:47,00:26:51,And the idea is that the AI computers can learn better to interact with humans through
00:26:51,00:26:53,various different ways.
00:26:53,00:26:58,The current way that they're doing it is that they are feeding these AI machines at Google.
00:26:58,00:27:04,"Currently, they're halfway through about halfway through 2,865 romance novels."
00:27:04,00:27:08,So they're just making the AI read romance novels.
00:27:08,00:27:12,And like the titles like Fatal Desire jacked up on Conditional Love?
00:27:12,00:27:13,Jacked up.
00:27:13,00:27:14,Jacked up.
00:27:14,00:27:16,This is Jack very romantic.
00:27:16,00:27:24,"Well, for a robot it wouldn't be."
00:27:24,00:27:29,The idea is that apparently when we're googling things our conversation in terms of the Google.
00:27:29,00:27:35,So we'll sometimes do quite a sort of chatty Google is very predictable and the best predictable
00:27:35,00:27:38,dialogue you can find is in romance novels.
00:27:38,00:27:42,And so they look to that and they feed it in so they come back.
00:27:42,00:27:48,Another just on the whole thing about big companies trying to work AI into Google doing
00:27:48,00:27:50,the romance novels Microsoft a while ago.
00:27:50,00:27:52,Did you read about their chatbot?
00:27:52,00:27:54,Does everyone know about this chatbot?
00:27:54,00:27:55,Oh my god.
00:27:55,00:27:56,Okay.
00:27:56,00:27:57,Everyone knows.
00:27:57,00:27:58,Let's move on.
00:27:58,00:28:02,"I could say if you don't know it in the room, basically they had this chatbot whereby they"
00:28:02,00:28:06,thought that it would just start its own Twitter feed and it would start talking to people.
00:28:06,00:28:11,And within 24 hours it transformed itself into what the article says is an evil Hitler
00:28:11,00:28:18,"loving, incestuous, sex-promoting, bush-did-9/11, proclaiming robot."
00:28:18,00:28:23,And all of its tweets to people writing to her said that she started calling them daddy
00:28:23,00:28:26,and asking them to shag her.
00:28:26,00:28:29,I thought that's her romance novels.
00:28:29,00:28:34,She has since announced that she will be voting trumps.
00:28:34,00:28:35,"But yeah, it goes wrong."
00:28:35,00:28:38,They thought they were going to do something that would respond fantastically well.
00:28:38,00:28:43,"Did it take things that people were, or that were proving especially a contractual"
00:28:43,00:28:44,Twitter?
00:28:44,00:28:49,"Because it learned from what people were tweeting towards it and so people started, they realized"
00:28:49,00:28:52,"that and started tweeting, really racist things and it just picked it all up."
00:28:52,00:28:55,"We had a wrap up really shortly, so if you've got anything."
00:28:55,00:28:58,I have a quick thing about the Duke of York.
00:28:58,00:29:02,I remember that.
00:29:02,00:29:06,I just thought I'd see what's going on in Duke of York news because of the Britain's
00:29:06,00:29:07,first robot thing.
00:29:07,00:29:12,"So in the last month, Prince Andrew has opened a business club in Hungate."
00:29:12,00:29:17,He has opened a luxury bed factory in Castle Donington and around about in Kent named after
00:29:17,00:29:22,him has caught fire.
00:29:22,00:29:24,So we're going to wrap up very shortly.
00:29:24,00:29:27,There were a bunch of stories that we really wanted to talk about tonight as our headline
00:29:27,00:29:29,"topics, but we didn't get time."
00:29:29,00:29:33,"So just very quickly, could you just let us know Jane's Andy and Anna what you would have"
00:29:33,00:29:34,gone for tonight?
00:29:34,00:29:35,I can't.
00:29:35,00:29:39,"One that we didn't get a chance to say is this one, which is new research, reveals that"
00:29:39,00:29:48,"the 20% of Americans are put off by the word moist, moist."
00:29:48,00:29:49,Anyone?
00:29:49,00:29:50,Moist.
00:29:50,00:29:53,Definitely a few people over there.
00:29:53,00:29:55,"Anna, what do you got?"
00:29:55,00:30:01,"I like this that after a man in Croydon lost a bet with a friend, the frozen food company"
00:30:01,00:30:12,Iceland has warned shoppers not to lie down in their freezers to cool off.
00:30:12,00:30:14,"And finally, Andy?"
00:30:14,00:30:19,"In China, under new guidelines from the Ministry of Culture, live streaming services have"
00:30:19,00:30:24,banned the eating of bananas in a neurotic manner.
00:30:24,00:30:31,"But someone, an unnamed Chinese person, has to have said they will eat yams instead."
00:30:31,00:30:32,"OK, that's it."
00:30:32,00:30:33,That is all of our facts.
00:30:33,00:30:35,Thank you so much for being here tonight.
00:30:35,00:30:36,Thank you all for watching at home.
