00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.560
 On the other hand, Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.440
 podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:29.520
 My name is Dan Schreiber, and I am sitting here with James Harcad, Annotzzytski, and Andrew

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.520
 Hunter Murray.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.040
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.240
 from the last seven days, and in a particular order, here we go.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.400
 Starting with my fact, my fact this week is that in America, you get traffic jams caused

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.400
 by people chasing tornadoes.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.040
 These are people who actively get in cars when they hear a tornado out there in the fields,

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.080
 and they try and track it and chase after it in buses and cars and so on.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.880
 And it used to be a very niche thing, but then TV shows started happening, and more and

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.240
 more people got into it.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.760
 They still quite niche, isn't that?

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.480
 Quite niche, but big enough that it's clogging up the roads because thousands of people are

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.480
 doing it now.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.480
 And the rural roads as well.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.480
 Yes.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.960
 It's not like you can get there always, sometimes it's just in the middle of a field that

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.960
 tornadoes happening.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.640
 I don't really know much about tornadoes, clearly, but...

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.280
 I think they don't adhere to roads and fields, and boundaries in general.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.160
 I think they just go where they want to.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.160
 Yeah, it's true.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.160
 I met recently in America, someone in Shelbyville, who was talking about training to become a storm

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.160
 chaser.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.320
 She does it for a living now, and she was going to be one of these people who were going

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.640
 to look for them.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.640
 And it happened.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.480
 Her interest was sparked after her entire house was destroyed.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.480
 Wow.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.480
 Yes.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.880
 So they all have these bunkers in America that they go into for tornado shelter.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.880
 And they don't have enough.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.480
 They're very angry because the government hasn't done enough about it.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.720
 But when you say they all do you mean people in tornado alley?

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.720
 Yes, yeah.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.720
 Sorry, what's tornado alley?

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.480
 Oh, it's just the area of America where the vast majority of tornadoes happen.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.480
 So it's Kansas kind of area, isn't it?

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.480
 Okay, I didn't know that.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.480
 It's the Wizard of Oz.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.480
 The Wizard of Oz.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.480
 Yeah.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.480
 Indeed.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.720
 But so Twister did a lot, the film Twister did a lot for tornado PR, didn't it?

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.720
 Yeah.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.720
 That was the big moment, really.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.800
 I think this is where tornado chases first picked up on the idea, and they did loads

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.320
 of research and they got really involved with the, you know, government weather systems team,

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.280
 whatever they're called, the NOAA, I think.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.920
 And they had lots of scientists on board the film and Bill Paxton got really into it.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.920
 Right.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.840
 And he did a documentary after it about tornadoes, I think.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.040
 But there was a really sweet moment early this year because he died in February.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.040
 That's right.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.680
 And there's this thing called the Spotter Network, which is this online network that all

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.800
 tornado chases are on.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.160
 And so the Spotter Network gives a GPS location for where the phone's owner is.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.320
 And so all these tornado chases lined up and spelled out the initials BP up tornado alley.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.320
 It was petroleum.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.320
 Yeah.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.320
 And that was weird.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.320
 Because Bill Paxton had shares in British petroleum.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.320
 Well, exactly.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.320
 Yeah.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.320
 But it was huge.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.120
 So I was looking at, I was looking at the initials and people were tweeting it.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.040
 And there are all these little green dots for where all the tornado chases are spelling

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.040
 out BP.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.040
 Yeah.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.720
 I looked at Google Maps and it was a massive amount of space they were covering.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.960
 So the line of the P was 230 miles high.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:18.960
 Really?

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:19.960
 Yeah.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:20.960
 Wow.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:21.960
 I thought it was just in a field or something.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:22.960
 Yeah.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.960
 But you don't need cars bumper to bumper for 230 miles.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:25.960
 No.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:26.960
 You can't just have two cars.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:27.960
 I'm just checking.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:28.960
 Yeah.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.760
 What you said about they use GPS, I think that's why this is so popular now, isn't it?

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.920
 Because in the olden days, in order to find a tornado, you'd have to go to the weather forecasters

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.200
 and you'd have to, you know, be quite an expert.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.200
 And these days, you just need an app on a car.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.200
 Yeah.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.200
 You can just find it.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.200
 Yeah.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.200
 Because you need to know in advance.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.120
 And we just have, we still have really bad tornado forecasting systems, don't we?

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.640
 I think the average amount of time between when you're told that there's a tornado coming

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.720
 towards you and when you have to be out of your house is 13 minutes.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.720
 Yes.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.720
 Still so.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.600
 So this is the big problem with the storm chases.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.160
 People now, if there is a tornado warning in their area, have to be prepared to leave extra

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.720
 early because just trying to flee their houses, they're going to get caught up in the traffic

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.640
 of the people actually heading towards the tornado.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.240
 They will be heading the other way.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.040
 They just are, yeah, I guess so, but so it'll be fine.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.040
 Oh, yeah.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.280
 I don't know if you need to turn left or right.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.280
 Yeah, exactly.

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.280
 Some roads are.

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.280
 Yeah.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.640
 Have you ever seen a disaster movie like everyone goes in the same direction?

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.920
 And if you go in in the opposite direction, you might get eaten by Godzilla, but at least

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:29.920
 you can get that quickly.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:30.920
 Yeah, that's true.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.200
 But no, you can't because everyone's going to film Godzilla because the Godzilla app

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.200
 they've got on their phone.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.200
 Yeah.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.280
 To extend as much for too far.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.560
 Speaking of movies, did you say you had a load of trivia before we started?

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.400
 That's the fact about Twister, but Anna read it out just now, so was that it?

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.400
 The Bill Paxon thing.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.400
 I've got one more.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.400
 Coming on.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.960
 In the film Twister, do you know what the noise of the tornado was?

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.160
 Oh, I will give you £1,000 if you guess.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.160
 Was it the camel's moan that was slowed down?

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.160
 Yeah.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:07.320
 So like back details, please do read them out, because I need them to get that thousand pounds

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.320
 back.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.680
 Yes, it was a camel's moan slowed down.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.280
 How did they make a camel moan?

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.960
 That sounds like the start of a joke.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.280
 So the other one bit of trivia about Twister is that it was the first Hollywood movie released

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.280
 on DVD.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.280
 Really?

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.280
 No.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.280
 That is a good bit of trivia.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.440
 That's cool, because it would have been the first movie to spin as well in order to play

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.440
 it.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.440
 Oh, yeah.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.440
 Although the spools of a VHS do spin.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.440
 Oh, damn it.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.440
 You're right.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.440
 Yes.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.440
 Sorry.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.440
 They used to have it in the 1980s, a mobile observatory.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.040
 So these days they have armoured cars and armoured trucks and things.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.360
 Some of them with radar dishes on the back to measure information when the professionals

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.360
 do it.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.240
 But in the '80s they had one, which was a massive barrel, and they just had to leave it

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.120
 in the path of a tornado, let it gather all the data that way, right?

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.360
 The really cool thing was it was called the Toronto-Tornado Observatory, or...

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.360
 Oh, Toronto.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.360
 Toto.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.360
 Toto.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.360
 Toto.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.360
 After the dog in the Wizard of Oz.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.360
 Wow.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.360
 How nice is that.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.360
 Not the band.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.360
 After the band, Toto.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.200
 They have the same one in Africa and they called it that after the band.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:18.120
 Do you know that one way to judge how much wind speed there is in a tornado used to be, whether

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.800
 it would strip all the feathers off a chicken?

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.560
 As if you would have a chicken near one or you would throw a chicken at it?

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:32.920
 They would fire a chicken out of a gun, like a cannon kind of thing towards the tornado

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.400
 to see if it would get stripped.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.400
 While it was happening.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.400
 While it was happening, yeah.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.640
 And then you go, "Oh, these chickens have lost all their feathers, so it must have been

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.840
 more than 341 miles per hour."

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:42.840
 Oh, OK.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:43.840
 It is that reliable?

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:44.840
 It's not reliable.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:45.840
 No, OK.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.760
 And the unreliability of it won a 1997 Ignore Bell Prize.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:55.440
 And it was worked out by Bernard Vonnegut, who's the brother of Kurt Vonnegut.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.440
 Oh, cool.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.440
 And so...

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.440
 That's awesome.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.960
 What happened was, they always used to use this system, and then he realised that there

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.400
 are reasons why it might not work.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.880
 Because he said that maybe the explosion from the gun might have got rid of all the feathers.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.520
 And the other thing is that sometimes chickens have particularly easy to pluck feathers.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.520
 Right.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.520
 It's cold and flight malt.

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.160
 And every now and then, like once a year or something, you can pluck them quite easily.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.400
 So if you get them at the wrong time, you might miscalculate the speed.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.400
 Wow.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:29.360
 I was reading about a different cannon just yesterday, which was meant to fire humans

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.360
 out of.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.960
 So it's a human cannonball style cannon.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:39.040
 But the idea was for firefighters and people who needed to get some meetings in other buildings.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.040
 Yeah.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.040
 I never went through.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.040
 I was reading it in a new science book.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.040
 I'm just too surprised me.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.040
 It never went through.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.040
 It was a new scientist book.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.040
 And it was using...

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.640
 So it was an air cannon.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.120
 The human was inside.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.000
 And the idea would be for firefighters if they needed to get to a top of a building that

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.280
 would have taken too long, they would have been shot out of the air cannon to the top

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.280
 of the building.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.160
 Would it not have been a tube that they went through the tube the whole way?

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.640
 The word was cannon, yeah.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:03.640
 So.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:04.640
 That's interesting.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.160
 So cannons as in human cannonballs, they usually springs rather than...

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.160
 So the idea was this was air, propulsion.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.160
 I have never thought.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.640
 I've never considered what actually is the form of propulsion for a human cannonball.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:15.640
 Well, now you know.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:16.640
 Now I know.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:17.640
 I did always sort of assume it was gunpowder.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.640
 Do you?

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:23.640
 But it makes no sense.

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:27.320
 Have you guys heard about the proposed Great Wall of Kansas?

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.320
 No.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.320
 No.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:30.320
 This is to stop tornadoes.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.320
 How big is it?

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:39.840
 It's a thousand feet high, 150 feet wide, and it would cost 60 billion dollars per 100 miles.

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.840
 This was proposed.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:41.840
 A thousand feet high, yeah.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.520
 This is sort of the Eiffel Tower all the way along.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.760
 This is a physicist from Pennsylvania, I believe.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:47.760
 He presented this.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.520
 No, an engineer then.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.520
 No.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.520
 No.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:56.720
 He said, "If we build three east-west Great Walls in the American Midwest, this is a three

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:57.720
 wall."

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.920
 So one in North Dakota, one along the border between Kansas and Oklahoma to the east and the

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:07.040
 third one in South Texas and Louisiana, we will diminish the tornado threats in tornado

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.800
 alley forever.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:13.480
 And he was presenting that research in 2014 to the annual meeting of American Physical

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.560
 Society in Denver.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.240
 Everyone said it's nonsense, obviously.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.920
 But he believes that it's a similar thing with mountain ranges and how they concurred

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:22.920
 tornadoes.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.440
 That's the idea behind it.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:28.520
 Let's tell you what, if you're a teenager in America and you're looking for a new career,

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:32.560
 be a massive wall builder, because it seems like, "Oh, yeah, yeah."

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:33.560
 It's your idea.

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:37.360
 I think if Donald Trump can't pass a 20-foot high wall, then I think the odds are passing

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:41.960
 a thousand foot high wall.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.680
 Hey, do you want to hear about an eclipse, Tracer?

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:45.680
 Yeah.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:46.680
 Yeah.

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:47.680
 Two out of three.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.680
 Yes, please, Andy.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:50.680
 Yes.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:51.680
 Quorum.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.040
 No, there are these people.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:56.680
 So America is about to have a massive eclipse on the 21st of August.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.960
 It's going to pass across a huge band of America.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:05.440
 And I think 88 million Americans live within 200 miles, and a lot of those people are expected

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.320
 to move towards this band as it moves.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.320
 OK.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.600
 But there are certain people who spend their whole lives, all their life savings, everything

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.320
 seeing eclipses around the world.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:18.400
 And one of them is a guy called Mike Kentrianakis, and he works for the American Astronomical Society,

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:22.520
 which is good, because before that, he was bankrupting himself, traveling around the

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.880
 world, seeing eclipses.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:27.480
 One of his marriages, I think it may be his first marriage, broke down partly because his

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.600
 wife didn't want him to go to Argentina to see an eclipse.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.680
 Would she not let him see his son?

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:33.680
 Oh!

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:34.680
 Hey, oh!

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:35.680
 Very good.

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:36.680
 That's very good.

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:41.720
 But it's got a heartening end, because now he's got this job, and he gets paid to go to

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:42.720
 all the eclipses.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:43.720
 Yeah, that's really cool.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:44.720
 Or he was spending all his money doing it.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:45.720
 Yeah.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.720
 His marriage is still over, isn't it?

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:47.720
 Yeah.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.760
 I guess if you're purely driven by money, fine.

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.680
 But if there are things more important in life, he's lost his family.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:54.680
 No, no, no, no, no.

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.720
 I mean, he may have found love again, we don't know.

00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:00.520
 But he said they had other problems as well, but this was just an indication that she wasn't

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.920
 able to support the thing he loves more than any other.

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:03.920
 Yeah.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.960
 What a weird, I mean, once you see an eclipse, you've seen them all, haven't you?

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:10.960
 Apparently, it's an incredible experience, and some people, for the first time they experience

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.440
 it, that's all they ever want to do again.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.440
 Yeah.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.960
 So do you all remember when we had one in the UK?

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:15.960
 Yeah.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:16.960
 It was fine.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:17.960
 Yeah, it was okay, wasn't it?

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:18.960
 Was it total?

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:19.960
 Yes.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.760
 I think it was cloudy and bit of London.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.160
 Yeah, and the bit where I was, I was in Sheffield, it wasn't quite total there.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.560
 But it was pretty total.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.560
 I think you had to go to like the silly islands or something.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.160
 Yeah, I was in Cornwall, where it was total, but it was quite cloudy.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:32.160
 So it was.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:36.760
 I think we've probably said this quote on the show before, but it's worth saying again.

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:42.760
 It was Ian M. Banks who said that if aliens did ever visit us, it would be to watch an

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:46.800
 eclipse, a total solar eclipse, because the rarity it must be in the universe of having

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.360
 a moon and a sun the exact same size that that could happen.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:51.360
 It's a tourist attraction.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.000
 That's why they would come to earth.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 It's come for the eclipse.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 Stay for the Kardashians.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 Yeah.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:05.800
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Andy.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:10.600
 My fact is, there is a special quarantine centre for chocolate in the English countryside.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.640
 Yeah, this is incredible.

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:13.640
 It is.

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:14.640
 It's amazing.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:19.040
 It's a place in Reading and it's called the International Coco quarantine centre or the

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:27.520
 ICQC and it's got about 400 different varieties of cocoa plants all in massive greenhouses and

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:32.400
 scientists observe them every week and they more of them come around every month and they

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:37.080
 do special checks on them and basically it's because if you're moving cocoa from one

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:41.160
 country to another, there's a real risk that a disease will move from one country to

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.160
 another.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:46.760
 The new blight made it to West Africa where loads of the world's cocoa is grown and it's

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.520
 a massive plant for their economy.

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:52.400
 That could cause massive hardship, distress and disaster.

00:12:52.400 --> 00:13:00.520
 So every variety moving around the world spends two years in quarantine at the ICQC in Reading.

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:01.520
 Right.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:02.520
 Yeah.

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:03.520
 And it's quite, is it quite new?

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:04.520
 Was it built a few years ago?

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:08.760
 No, it's been going since 1985 but they've got a new home since 2015.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:09.760
 Okay.

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:10.760
 Yeah, yeah.

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:16.080
 Sorry, just so I can wrap my head round this, they're collecting the cocoa plants from around

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.600
 the world to sit there to put through quarantine.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.600
 It's not chocolate bars.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.600
 It's not.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:24.160
 That's why all the chocolate you eat is off now.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:29.600
 But what I mean is, if a new plant is going to be used or if they're going to use it from

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:35.440
 mass shipment, they have to then send samples to these guys or you have to send, you send

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:40.400
 the budwood, which is a little length of branch with a bud sprouting, right?

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.840
 They put it in an insect-proof cage, just in case it's got an insect, which carries disease

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.560
 on it for a couple of months.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:49.360
 Then they grow it, they grow a clone, that's called an indicator of a rifle.

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:53.840
 And then if after two years the plant is completely free of disease, it's allowed to go

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:57.200
 on to the place it was going to go to in the first place.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.200
 So if you ever want to send cocoa from one part of the world to the other, it has to go

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.200
 through Reading.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.200
 Exactly.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.200
 Wow.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.200
 It's like getting a train to Bristol, isn't it?

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:12.480
 And also looking at photos of this place, it looked a bit like, I assume they keep elements

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.960
 of the cocoa that's been sent to them, they don't just send out the whole thing.

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:23.000
 It looks like it's a, the life raft of endangered cocoa plants, it's the one true spot that we

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.400
 know we're preserving them.

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.400
 Yeah.

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:28.800
 It makes it, nothing makes me feel patriotic usually, but reading about this, I thought,

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.280
 wow, we are so special.

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:33.840
 We in Britain are saving the world's chocolate.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:34.840
 That's a big deal.

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:35.840
 It's really impressive.

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.840
 And the world's chocolate is kind of under threat, isn't it?

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:43.480
 So the demand is massively exceeding supply at the moment and we're running out of cocoa

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.480
 plants.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:45.480
 They're really hard to farm.

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:51.600
 So I think only 30% of them, if you have a cocoa farm, only 30% of your plants will actually

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.440
 flower and create the cocoa, because there are so many pests.

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.440
 Yeah.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:59.560
 They've got these diseases with really cool names, like frosty pod and witch's broom.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:04.720
 So there's a list on Wikipedia of all these diseases, and a lot of them have the

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.000
 word "pod" at the end, like frosty pod.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.760
 And so do a lot of podcasts.

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:16.880
 So I wonder if you can tell me whether these cocoa disease or podcasts.

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:23.320
 So frosty pod, you said, black pod, oh, I disease, podcast.

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:24.320
 Disease.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:29.160
 It's a disease, ghost pod.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.160
 Podcast.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:39.640
 Does it be either, it really does disease, it's a podcast, two for two, chicken pop pod.

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:40.640
 Disease.

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:41.640
 Disease.

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:42.640
 Podcast.

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:43.640
 What?

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.640
 So comedy podcast.

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:46.640
 Mealy pod.

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:47.640
 Disease.

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:48.640
 Disease.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:49.640
 Disease.

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:50.640
 A podcast.

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:51.640
 It's a disease.

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:55.720
 And I got a million more of those, but that was the end of the game.

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.840
 They're just the four that were sponsored by this week.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.840
 Oh, that was a very exciting game.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:00.840
 I had a game before.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:02.640
 I just have a game every time.

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:03.640
 Yeah, that's great.

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:07.280
 So this place was, this is how important this is to the chocolate industry.

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:12.400
 It was funded mutually by a large group of the biggest chocolate makers in the world

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:17.480
 from Cadbury through to Mars, through to Willy Wonka, through to, no, he doesn't exist.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.480
 That was a game.

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.480
 Well, there is Willy Wonka.

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:20.480
 Candy, they bought.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.480
 There's a brand.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.480
 Yeah.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.480
 Oh, then it could be.

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.800
 Well, then very, very well, maybe an investor in this place.

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:29.240
 Anna, does this still make you feel really patriotic that our country is doing this?

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:31.560
 Well, actually, it's just a load of multi-nationers.

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:36.800
 It's gradually seeping away my nascent nationalism, sure.

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:41.680
 Just quickly, do you know why this cocoa chocolate quarantine centre is in Reading?

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:42.840
 Oh, no.

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:47.120
 Well, Reading was their football team's called The Biscuit Men, so there's a biscuit company

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.120
 there.

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.120
 Exactly.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.120
 It's for the chocolate biscuit.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:51.120
 No, sadly, it's not that.

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:57.800
 It's because it's so cold in Britain and particularly Reading that none of the diseases

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:02.120
 which they're potentially harboring in the centre could survive outside in the wilds

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.520
 of the countryside around Reading.

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:04.520
 It's that, yeah.

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:08.080
 Yeah, so well, that's why it's in Britain, basically, Reading is an afterthought.

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:12.120
 So, this is really common with other crops as well, isn't it?

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:15.720
 There are various other things that get quarantined in countries that are the opposite of where

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:16.720
 they came from.

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.600
 It's like going on a gap, yeah.

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:21.120
 You go somewhere as different as you can to your home country.

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:26.480
 So, I think bananas, most bananas spend some time in Belgium in transit.

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:30.160
 Coffee goes to Portugal and spend some time being in Portugal.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:35.160
 And yeah, it has to be places where the usual pests of those crops won't survive in that

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.160
 climate.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.160
 Portugal, though, as well.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.160
 It's quite warm, isn't it?

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.160
 Is it?

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.160
 Yeah.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.160
 Because, simply, it's come from, like, Brazil or somewhere.

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.160
 Not the opposite of Brazil, is it?

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.160
 It's not.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.160
 It's very much not.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.160
 It's not the exact opposite.

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:46.160
 You're right.

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.760
 But I use the colonial oppressor of Brazil of anything.

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.800
 Are you sending every banana there?

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:52.800
 No!

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:53.800
 No!

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:54.800
 No!

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:55.800
 No!

00:17:55.800 --> 00:18:00.240
 Not every chocolate bar goes to redding.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:06.400
 You can just listen back to Andy's explanation at the start when you hear this.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:12.640
 Do you know what the most expensive chocolate ever sold for is, and this is in terms of-

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:13.640
 Okay.

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:15.640
 Do you want the price or what's in the chocolate or-

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.360
 Maybe price and what the chocolate was.

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:18.360
 Was it a-

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:19.360
 Okay.

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:22.160
 I'll say a million pounds, and it was a bar of flexed with gold.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:23.160
 Yeah.

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:27.760
 This is a hard one because I think there probably are more expensive chocolates on the market.

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:30.400
 So this was sold at Christie's Auction House.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.400
 Okay.

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:32.400
 Okay.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.400
 So it was a historical piece of chocolate.

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:35.400
 Yes.

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.400
 It was something that Mallory took up ever.

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:38.400
 Very close.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.000
 You're totally in the territory in that it's exploration.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.600
 Is it Chacolton took to the south?

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:43.600
 So close.

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:44.600
 It's exactly in the-

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:45.600
 Yes.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:46.600
 Scott.

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.600
 It's like a diddle the hardware.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:55.400
 Scott's first expedition to the Antarctic in the early 1900s, and how much did his bar?

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.840
 It's one little lump of chocolates.

00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:59.040
 Was it made of gold as well?

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.040
 No.

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:01.040
 No, it was just made of chocolate.

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.040
 Yeah.

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:03.040
 20,000 pounds.

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:04.040
 No.

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:08.640
 I'll go for a bar of chocolate, £7,984.

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:09.640
 Okay.

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:13.480
 I think, actually, less than, I think £4,500.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:14.480
 £470.

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:15.480
 Oh, okay.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:16.480
 Yeah.

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:18.480
 I've never shot it.

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:19.480
 20,000 was way off, wasn't it?

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:20.480
 Yeah.

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:24.240
 But I would have thought 20,000 was more in the ballpark of something that is attached to an extraordinarily

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:27.240
 historically important trip.

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:31.640
 The thing is, I bet they did an auction with lots of different things from his expedition.

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:32.640
 They did.

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.160
 And this was probably the shittiest one of the lots.

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:35.160
 Yes.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.160
 His diaries went and they went for £600, so-

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.160
 £600?

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.160
 No, of course not.

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.000
 No, they were like £90,000, £200,000, something like that.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.800
 So this is for the one person who couldn't get anything else in the light.

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:46.800
 I'll just get the chocolate.

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:47.800
 Yeah, just, yeah.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:48.800
 I'll bring the chocolate out.

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:52.800
 With something to eat on the way out.

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:53.800
 Yeah.

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:54.800
 Exactly.

00:19:54.800 --> 00:20:00.720
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Chisinski.

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:06.520
 Yep, my fact is that, to celebrate the Communist Revolution, the Bolsheviks plan to build a tower

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:11.000
 in St. Petersburg that projected the news onto the clouds.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 Oh.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.520
 And this was this really cool idea, it was part of, so as soon as the Bolshevik Revolution

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:19.480
 happened, Lenin launched this thing called the monumental propaganda campaign.

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:23.480
 And the idea was to build all these monuments, it's quite a clever pun when it's translated

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:24.480
 into English.

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:29.680
 But the idea was to build all these monuments, which were a big piece of Soviet propaganda.

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:34.680
 And this guy was commissioned, this architect called Tatlin, Vladimir Tatlin, was commissioned

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:39.040
 to design something that was going to be called the Monument to the Third International.

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:44.560
 And so in 1919 he designed this insane building, which is, it's often called the most influential

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.080
 building that was never built.

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.080
 Wow.

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:51.760
 Because it's inspired lots of artists and designers ever since, and it's just really fascinating.

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:56.800
 And it was going to be 400 meters tall, it was going to be made of steel and glass and

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:57.800
 iron.

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:00.800
 It was this double helix structure, so it looks like a spiral on the way up.

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:04.280
 And it had these amazing features, so various bits of it rotated.

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:08.160
 These huge glass cubes were then it rotated at different speeds.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:14.120
 And there was a plan on the top bit to have this information center, which would issue

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:20.640
 news bulletins that in the night time, or on a cloudy day, shot up into the sky and broadcast

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:24.640
 in light the news announcements or propaganda onto the sky, onto the clouds.

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:25.640
 It's very cool.

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:26.640
 It's very cool.

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:31.640
 I think people might be familiar with this tower, because it's quite a famous iconic thing.

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:36.840
 They had a replica of it in the Royal Academy last year or the year before, I think.

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:37.840
 I don't know.

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.680
 And it looks a little bit like the tower at the Olympic Park.

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:41.680
 It does.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:42.680
 That's exactly what I was thinking.

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:47.880
 And often if you see any kind of old pictures of Soviet Russia from the 1920s, this is

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:49.720
 kind of an iconic image, right?

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:50.720
 Yeah.

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.240
 And they used it and it kind of represented their ambition.

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:56.480
 So it was used as a Soviet icon in the '50s and '60s to show how great they were.

00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:01.720
 Wait, so this building wasn't built, but all the plans and the drawings were released.

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:02.720
 Yes.

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:05.160
 We've then sort of subtly built it without...

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.160
 They've built it.

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.160
 At the time even, they built a lot of smaller versions of it.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.160
 Okay.

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:13.240
 So it was so massive that there's no, it was impossible to build basically.

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:17.320
 They wouldn't be able to get enough iron, they wouldn't be able to get enough steel.

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:21.000
 And for something, yeah, that was supposed to be like a building, something which has a real

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.400
 social purpose, but the fact is that it was impossible for them to make any work.

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:25.400
 Yeah.

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.760
 Pretty ironic, guys.

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:31.640
 Considering what happened with the communism.

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:32.640
 Yeah.

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:33.640
 Good.

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:34.640
 Right.

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:35.640
 Communist anti-communist asylum.

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:36.640
 Nice idea.

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:37.640
 But...

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:38.640
 Doesn't work in practice.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:39.640
 Right.

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:40.640
 Yeah, it doesn't work in practice.

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:41.640
 It doesn't get off the ground.

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:43.320
 No, the thing is, Anna, has never been properly tried.

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:44.320
 That's the problem.

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:45.320
 It's just tried in the wrong place.

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:46.320
 It was the wrong environment.

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.320
 It was the wrong environment.

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:48.320
 It was the wrong environment.

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:49.320
 It was the wrong environment.

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:50.320
 It was the wrong environment.

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:51.320
 It was the wrong environment.

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:52.320
 It was the wrong environment.

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:53.320
 It was the wrong environment.

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:54.320
 It was the wrong environment.

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:55.320
 It was the wrong environment.

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:56.320
 It was the wrong environment.

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:57.320
 It was the wrong environment.

00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:58.320
 It was the wrong environment.

00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:59.320
 It was the wrong environment.

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:00.320
 It was the wrong environment.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:01.320
 It was the wrong environment.

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:02.320
 Yeah.

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.320
 It was the wrong environment.

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:04.320
 It was the wrong environment.

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.320
 It was the wrong environment.

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.320
 building or was the whole of the building revolving?

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:09.160
 - So there were different layers of the building

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.080
 and it would revolve at different rates.

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:12.880
 So one of them would revolve once a day

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.320
 and another one would be once a week

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:15.600
 and another one would be once a month.

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.280
 And then the bottom one would be,

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.040
 I think the bottom one would be once a year,

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:20.480
 it would revolve. - Wow.

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:23.600
 - And so you'd be able to tell what date and time it was by.

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:25.520
 - It was a giant calendar. - It made a plot.

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.640
 - And it was in a double helix as well.

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.720
 Even though the structure of DNA hadn't been,

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:31.560
 I think, discovered at this time,

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:34.080
 the whole around the cylinder and the cube

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.480
 and the pyramid and everything that was this huge double helix.

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.120
 - Yeah, there's this one guy who's written

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:40.520
 a big kind of biography of this building

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:42.880
 who says that it was never intended to be built.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.480
 So some people think that it was just a thing

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:46.920
 that was meant to represent, I don't know,

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:50.000
 the ambition or the symbolism of the new Soviet Russia

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.920
 that it wasn't meant to be built, but we don't know.

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:54.320
 - The news in the clouds is that a,

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:56.360
 was scientifically, is that a practical thing?

00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:58.280
 I'm purely thinking it is out of the fact

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:00.480
 that the Batman logo can be put into the sky.

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.400
 - I know that is a good documentary.

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:05.320
 - Yeah, and with sequels, but I don't think it was.

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:06.880
 So this is the thing I had no idea

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:08.720
 that they weren't trying experimenting

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.920
 with these wildly technologically advanced ideas,

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.400
 but I don't think that was practical.

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:14.080
 - It is practical. - At the time, now.

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:16.360
 - Yeah. - Because there was a guy

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:18.000
 in Nottingham called Dave Lynch

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 and he fired a ghost rider onto the clouds

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.320
 in Nottingham a few years ago.

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:24.920
 - Okay. - A ghost rider.

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:28.480
 - Yeah, so it's like a ghostly horse rider guy.

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:30.920
 - Oh, cool. - And it was a bit like my bridges,

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:34.160
 if you know that old, one of the first animations

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:36.440
 of the like a galloping horse. - Yeah, yeah.

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:37.800
 - It literally was that.

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:40.680
 - It used exactly the same projector as my bridge, didn't it?

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:42.640
 But it used a laser instead of light.

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:43.760
 - But there's quite a long way to go

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:46.240
 until we can watch Liar Liar on a cloud.

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:47.720
 - Is it? - Yeah, right.

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:48.960
 - Because it's done with the laser,

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.760
 so it's all in the green light of the laser.

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:53.200
 - But what they were originally doing was the news.

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.960
 So maybe it would be less difficult

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.520
 to put like Kay Berlion than Liar Liar

00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.120
 because she's only in one studio.

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.520
 - That's true. - Mm-hmm.

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:01.800
 - Did I miss a reference?

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:04.640
 Why are we using a Jim Carey movie from--

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:05.480
 - It's just a wrap.

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.360
 - Sorry, I just tried to think of a really good film.

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:08.200
 - Yeah.

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:09.840
 - You came over my head. - Okay, cool.

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:11.000
 Sorry, I thought I missed a reference

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.400
 for that was just absolutely did not.

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:13.240
 - Okay.

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:14.960
 - That was just crowbarring in a movie.

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:15.840
 - You're choice a movie to play

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:17.680
 into the clouds with Liar Liar.

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:18.680
 - So it's just been half the book.

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.720
 I was talking about twist already.

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.680
 - What would you put into the clouds?

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:26.200
 - I just, well, a latest movie, the new Spider-Man,

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.200
 or a Game of Thrones episode.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.240
 - But here's the thing about that.

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:31.320
 If you put the latest Spider-Man in,

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:32.560
 then no one's gonna go to the cinema

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:34.640
 'cause they can just watch it in the clouds, right?

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:35.920
 But if you put Liar Liar on,

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:37.600
 which is probably on terrestrial TV

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.240
 pretty much once a year or something,

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:41.160
 then it's fine, you don't lose any money.

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:42.600
 - I want a day, I want a day in my flat.

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:43.440
 - So yeah.

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:44.800
 (laughing)

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:46.720
 And also down, when people listen to this podcast

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:47.720
 did a few months, they'll go,

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.280
 "New Spider-Man, what's that?"

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:50.120
 - Yeah.

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:50.960
 - Whereas Liar Liar is one of the--

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:51.800
 - It's timeless.

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:53.520
 - Well, yeah, that's a movie there.

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:55.000
 Induros.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.520
 You were talking about the bat signal.

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:57.440
 - Yes, I was, yeah.

00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:02.240
 - Do you know how they summon Batman on a cloudless night?

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.800
 - So they project it onto the moon?

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:04.800
 - They project it.

00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:05.960
 - Or a star.

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:07.680
 - They project it onto a star.

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:08.520
 - Do they just call them?

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:10.240
 Does he just probably go on a phone?

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:11.960
 - Well, there is the bat phone, is there?

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:13.160
 - No, it's none of these things.

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:14.960
 Supposedly, I mean, this is, it's all made up.

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:15.800
 - Side of a building.

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:16.880
 - Side of a building.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:17.720
 - Is it?

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:18.560
 - Yes.

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:19.560
 - How come we've never seen that?

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:21.920
 Is it just very bad weather in Gotham City most of the time?

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.040
 - Yeah, I think so.

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:25.640
 And someone, but someone incredibly geeky

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:28.640
 on Quora pointed out, actually, 'cause Gotham is near water,

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:29.920
 it's liable to have more cloud,

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.080
 'cause they'll be, you know, water rising.

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:33.680
 I don't know how true that it's weather-wise, but.

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:34.680
 - Also smart.

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:35.520
 - Yeah.

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:37.600
 - Probably for them, it's quite good to have bad pollution.

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:38.600
 - Yes.

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:40.160
 - Is it quite polluted Gotham City?

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:41.000
 - Yeah, it's not.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.760
 - The Batmobile is diesel, I think, isn't it?

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:43.760
 So that's what it is.

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:46.920
 (all laughing)

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.120
 - It was so embarrassing that time,

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:49.920
 you accidentally filled it up with odd weather.

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.800
 (all laughing)

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:54.280
 - That was Robin that did that.

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:56.120
 - That's why he's never allowed to take it out anymore.

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:58.280
 (all laughing)

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:01.560
 - So the tallest building ever envisioned

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:05.760
 was the X-seed 4000, and it was gonna be in Tokyo,

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:08.360
 and it was gonna be four kilometers high,

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:11.800
 pretty much in the shape of Mt. Fuji,

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:13.320
 and it would be able to accommodate

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:15.880
 between half a million and one million people.

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:17.080
 - Wow. - Wow.

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:19.680
 - And they did the kind of plans for this,

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:21.200
 but never built it.

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.200
 - Why not unrealistic again?

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:26.360
 - Well, according to the managing director

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:29.160
 of buildings and data, George Binder,

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:31.360
 he says that they never really meant to build it.

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:34.960
 The purpose was to earn some recognition for the firm.

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:36.520
 - Yeah, all these people claiming.

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:37.760
 - No, we never really meant to build it.

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:38.760
 - They're always saying this.

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.480
 - And they reckon it would have cost

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:45.480
 minimum of about $500 billion US dollars to make it.

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:49.000
 But from the other fact, I saw that we eat

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.080
 about $100 billion a year on chocolate,

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:54.360
 so we'd only have to give up chocolate as a world

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:56.880
 for five years, and we'd be able to build this tower.

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:57.720
 - Cool.

00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:00.440
 - I don't, no, that's not what I thought at all.

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:01.280
 - Why not?

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:02.720
 - I think the vast majority of people in the world

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:03.800
 would vote to keep chocolate

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:05.840
 and not have a random tower build somewhere in Japan.

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:08.000
 - No, but we would be saving chocolate potentially.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 We would replenish the stock.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.880
 We would perhaps allow for the leaves to breathe a bit.

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:15.200
 - Not for the odds of it, you get a lot less chocolate grown

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:16.200
 if everyone stops eating it.

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.000
 So actually, the stocks would crash then.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:18.840
 - Yeah.

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:20.400
 There was another Soviet building

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:23.720
 that was supposed to be built was the thing

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:25.960
 that was going to replace the 19th Central Cathedral

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.920
 of Christ the Saviour, which was like Sonicless,

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:31.320
 the first huge landmark in St Petersburg,

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.960
 what became Petrograd and then Leningrad.

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:37.640
 And so the plan was to build this amazing skyscraper

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:39.480
 that was going to be, it looked like a huge wedding cake,

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:42.240
 and on top of it was going to have an 80 meter high statue

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:45.920
 of Lenin, and in his head was going to be a library,

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:47.120
 a Soviet library.

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:49.440
 And it was, again, it was kind of a ridiculous plan,

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:51.760
 but they flattened the Zara's Cathedral.

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:52.760
 So they said, "We'll get ready for that."

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:55.160
 And then the USSR ran out of money,

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:56.360
 so that just remained flat.

00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:59.520
 And all it became was the world's largest open-air swimming pool.

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:00.360
 - Oh.

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:02.640
 - Which is kind of cooler than a giant Lenin head.

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:04.880
 - The designs were amazing for,

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:06.800
 I remember seeing the designs for that building.

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:07.640
 - For Lenin head building.

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.200
 - Yeah, would the Lenin head building

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:11.680
 have had a massive swimming pool where his bladder would have been?

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:13.160
 (laughing)

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:14.720
 - That's not re-appealing, is it?

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:15.960
 Because of the associations.

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:16.800
 - Why not?

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:17.800
 - Don't know, it'd be fun.

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:19.840
 - A patriotic Soviet bladder.

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:20.680
 - I guess.

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:22.680
 - Probably encourage you to be in it.

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:23.520
 - It would.

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.040
 The associations of the word bladder.

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:25.880
 - That's true.

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:27.440
 - And you can have a watershoot coming out.

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:28.280
 - Moving out.

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:29.120
 - Your re-trap.

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:31.360
 (laughing)

00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:32.200
 - So great.

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:33.200
 - I like this plan more and more.

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.040
 The more I think about it, properly.

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:37.840
 - But if you've got a watershoot coming out,

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:39.080
 the bladder's behind that.

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:41.160
 So when you come out of the end of the re-trap,

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:43.520
 you just fly into midair, right?

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:45.200
 - Yeah, you just launch back into the city.

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.040
 - You launch it.

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:46.880
 - You're not uncomfortable.

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.640
 - And you're designed for all these cannons

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:51.720
 that fire fighters up to the top of buildings.

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:53.560
 - I don't think we should give up on it,

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:54.480
 but let's park it.

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:55.480
 (laughing)

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:56.480
 - Let's park it for now.

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:59.060
 (upbeat music)

00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:04.680
 - Okay, it is time for a final fact

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:07.200
 to the show, and that is James.

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:09.480
 - Okay, my fact this week is that caterpillars

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:12.480
 are more likely to vomit when they're on their own.

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:13.520
 - Right.

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:16.440
 - We all throw up when we're lonely, come on.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.120
 - Well, is that why they do it?

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:19.920
 - Then I don't know if they're lonely,

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:22.960
 but the reason that they vomit is to get rid of predators,

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:25.880
 because predators don't like being vomited on.

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:27.680
 And when they're in a group,

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:30.360
 they don't need to do it because they're in a group.

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:33.560
 And actually one of their mates can vomit instead.

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:36.320
 And so what happens is if you vomit,

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:39.040
 it's bad for you 'cause you get rid of your nutrition

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:41.040
 and you need that food.

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:43.000
 But if you're in a group and someone else vomits,

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.600
 then it gets rid of the predator

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:46.880
 and you've still got all of your food inside you.

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:49.400
 And so a study was done in 2012

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:51.000
 that found that this caterpillar

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.480
 of the large white butterfly,

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.320
 they are more likely when they're in a group

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:57.880
 to try and cheat and let someone else do the vomiting.

00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:58.800
 - Oh, wow.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:30:59.880
 - But what if they all think that?

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:03.320
 This is typical selfish, individualistic 21st century society.

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:07.000
 If you all think someone else will pick up that rubbish,

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:07.840
 then no one's gonna do it.

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:09.800
 - That's why caterpillars need to go back

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.040
 to a Soviet sister.

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:12.800
 - Yeah, I think that last fact

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:14.920
 really infected you a bit, isn't it?

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:17.560
 - It's amazing how they're all waiting for the other guy

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:18.920
 to get the round in basically.

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:19.920
 - Yeah.

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:20.760
 - I'm just really sorry.

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:22.400
 I've just been working out the caterpillar.

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:25.000
 It is very almost an unagram of capitalist, isn't it?

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.800
 So it's no wonder they brought down

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:30.080
 the Soviet system with their self-serving ways.

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:32.760
 There's, did you see the caterpillar they found?

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:34.960
 I think last year or the year before,

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:39.960
 it was in Peru and it's from the Nomata Campo genus.

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:41.240
 It was in the Amazon.

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:43.160
 And it responds if you shouted it.

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:44.720
 It doesn't like being shouted at.

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:47.000
 And it's got these tentacles on its back.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.280
 And there's a film of it.

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:50.840
 And if you just yell at the caterpillar like that,

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:53.320
 then it's tentacles just flick out straight away.

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:54.760
 So it's like, you know, when you're talking to a microphone

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:56.840
 and you watch the sound waves go up and down as you do,

00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:57.960
 it's like that.

00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.280
 As soon as you yell at it,

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:01.920
 it fires out these long tentacles from its back.

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:04.160
 - But is it scarier or is it attacking you?

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:05.320
 - We have no idea why it does that.

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:09.440
 - Because you use it as a way of measuring sound, couldn't you?

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:10.280
 - You absolutely could.

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:13.040
 - You could use it like as a clapometer or something.

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:13.880
 - Yes.

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:15.240
 - If you want to know who's the most popular,

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:17.200
 you get them to applaud and then you have loads

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.400
 of these little caterpillars.

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:20.840
 And the longer their tentacles go out, the more popular you are.

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:21.680
 - Wow.

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:22.520
 - That would be so cool.

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:24.120
 Until the RSPCA got onto you,

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:27.120
 that would be unbelievably cool to have a mass of caterpillars.

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:29.200
 - But you could do it on like Britain's Got Talent,

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:30.640
 instead of having the judges,

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:32.720
 just have audience reactions.

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:33.560
 - Yeah.

00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:34.960
 - Well, in the chairs, they're all caterpillars.

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:35.800
 - Yeah.

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:37.600
 - I do like that, actually.

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:38.680
 I would watch.

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:41.280
 - And the longer the tentacle, the more they like it.

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:42.120
 - Yeah.

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:42.960
 - You measure the tentacles.

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:44.120
 - But we don't yet know if they like it or not.

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:46.240
 So the worst acts might get through.

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:48.680
 - Yeah, it's actually just the loudest acts.

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:51.960
 - Yeah, but it's not the loudest audience response.

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:53.200
 - Yeah, sorry, sorry.

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:54.480
 So they're not in the judges seat.

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:55.320
 Sorry, they're the audience.

00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:57.480
 - It's much more democratic than Britain's Got Talent.

00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:58.600
 - No, they are in the judges seats.

00:32:58.600 --> 00:32:59.680
 The caterpillars aren't the audience,

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:02.080
 because you need an audience to make the noise.

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:03.080
 - So sorry.

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:04.760
 - Yeah, but booze are noises as well.

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:05.600
 - Oh, yeah.

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:06.440
 - Yeah.

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:08.240
 - You're so right.

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:09.840
 - Actually, there'd been many times

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:11.120
 doing stand-up, I'd be very grateful

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:13.080
 for the fact that booze are also noise.

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:16.080
 (all laughing)

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:18.040
 - How did the sugar go, Andy?

00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:19.200
 Well, they were very loud.

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:22.040
 (all laughing)

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:23.320
 - More vomiting caterpillars?

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:24.160
 - Yes, please.

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:27.680
 - The caterpillars of the small, muttled willow moth.

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:30.160
 They vomit, not just what's in the stomach,

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:32.360
 but also kind of a detergent.

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:34.560
 And they do this onto ants.

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:36.920
 And the reason being that they have a lot

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:38.440
 of kind of water in their stomach.

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:40.240
 So when they vomit it onto the ants,

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:43.480
 this detergent kind of stops the surface tension

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:46.560
 of the water from being a blob on the ants' head.

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:48.840
 And instead, the water goes all over the ants,

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:50.440
 and then he has to kind of clean it off

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:51.680
 otherwise he'll drown.

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:52.520
 - Oh wow.

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:55.480
 - And so, yeah, it's amazing.

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:56.640
 - I thought you meant like a detergent,

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:59.400
 like if I had a big boozy night out, I'd vomit

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:00.520
 and be like, I need to clean that up.

00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:01.480
 Oh no, I don't.

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:02.760
 It's just cleaned itself up.

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:04.560
 (all laughing)

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:06.240
 That would be a great bit of evolution.

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:07.480
 - Yeah, I think if you just had to vomit

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:09.560
 into the washing machine before you guys did.

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:11.760
 (all laughing)

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:14.080
 - Did you know that, so really about caterpillar vomit,

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:16.880
 the evolutionary biologist and a lot of the articles

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:20.000
 who studies caterpillars vomiting is called Jane Yak.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.240
 (all laughing)

00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:23.280
 - No, that's not a good one.

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:25.080
 - There is a species of caterpillar

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:26.680
 that lives on coca leaves.

00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:28.280
 And when they vomit on predators,

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:30.520
 the vomit contains cocaine.

00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:31.360
 - Whoa.

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:32.200
 - Whoa.

00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:34.760
 - Which presumably the predators don't like

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:35.760
 for whatever reason.

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:36.600
 - Right.

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:38.640
 - But it itself is not high all the time

00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:40.240
 on cocaine for the eating it.

00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:43.640
 - Yeah, so it doesn't metabolize the cocaine

00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:45.040
 to make it go crazy.

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:45.880
 - Yeah.

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:48.040
 - But when it's eaten by the predators,

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:50.080
 something happens to them and they don't like it.

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:53.680
 - But is it worth, if you find, where is this?

00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:55.640
 - I don't know, but it must be where coca leaves grow,

00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:56.480
 so South America.

00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:57.320
 - Somewhere in South America.

00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:59.320
 (all laughing)

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:00.200
 - That's so cool.

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:01.840
 - If you find a caterpillar in South America,

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:04.680
 is it worth giving it a snort just in case?

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:07.400
 - No, I don't think so, because it might be one of the other ones.

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:09.880
 So for instance, the East and Tent Caterpillar,

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:12.120
 they'll deliberately eat parts of the cherry leaves

00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:15.280
 that contain cyanide and they'll vomit out cyanide.

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:16.120
 - Wow.

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:17.920
 - Okay, so it's not worth risking it

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:19.960
 for the cocaine high in case you get the cyanide poison.

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:20.800
 - Yeah.

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:21.640
 - Yeah, fair enough.

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:23.560
 - You know the very hungry caterpillar at the book.

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:24.720
 I do.

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:27.760
 A copy of that book has been bought every minute

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:30.200
 since it was published in 1969.

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:31.040
 - No.

00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:31.880
 - Yes.

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:32.720
 - Because shop's closed.

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:33.560
 (all laughing)

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:35.000
 - It's been unabouraged.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.040
 - Yeah, but the world turns then.

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:37.880
 - World turns.

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:39.280
 - Shop's open.

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:40.120
 - Oh yeah.

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:42.480
 - Just when the book shops in Japan are opening for the day.

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:43.320
 - That's true.

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:44.760
 - So it's-- - Is everything in Japan?

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:45.600
 - Yeah.

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:47.960
 It's been translated to every, what I'm saying is

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:49.760
 that it sold 30 million copies, all right?

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:51.320
 Otherwise, guys. (all laughing)

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:53.480
 Would you add up all the minutes between 96 and I know.

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:55.360
 - But it could have sold them all yesterday.

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:56.200
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:57.040
 - Yeah.

00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:58.560
 - But it didn't because I remember reading it as a child.

00:35:58.560 --> 00:35:59.400
 - Yay.

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:00.760
 - You might have got a free copy.

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:02.200
 It might have been like a preview copy.

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:03.040
 - It wasn't like a free copy.

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:04.400
 - A copy, a proof copy, yeah.

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:05.240
 - There you go.

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:06.920
 - But it's been proof copies this whole time.

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:08.160
 (all laughing)

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:09.880
 This is the year it's finally published.

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:10.880
 (all laughing)

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:11.720
 - How should we do?

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:13.600
 - No, let's do 30 million copies.

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:15.960
 (all laughing)

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.080
 - Okay, it's impressive, guys.

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:19.080
 Anyway, but my point is that the plot

00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:21.760
 of the very hungry cat footage is completely inaccurate.

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:22.600
 - What?

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:23.360
 - For one very simple reason.

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.320
 'Cause on the first day, he has an orange on the second day,

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:27.040
 he has two apples, and I'm getting the fruits a bit wrong.

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:29.280
 But he eats a lot of stuff over the course of the day.

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:30.280
 - He eats some cocaine.

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:31.800
 - He eats some cocaine.

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.040
 - I don't think he read this book.

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:34.480
 (all laughing)

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:37.040
 What point is that almost all caterpillars

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:40.000
 have one specific plant only that they like to feed on.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.600
 So the very hungry catapilla is an absurd fiction.

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:45.120
 - It should have just been every page.

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:47.440
 - He ate an apple, he ate another bit of apple.

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:49.560
 He ate another bit of the same apple.

00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:51.560
 He ate another bit of the same species of apple.

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:54.360
 That's what you're recommending for the sequel.

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:55.360
 - Yeah, I am.

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:56.840
 (all laughing)

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:59.240
 - Very hungry and factually accurate catapilla.

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:01.400
 (all laughing)

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:04.760
 'Cause you know flies vomit, so you're a fly lands on your food

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:06.040
 and then it vomits straight away

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:09.080
 because it can't metabolize food internally.

00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:11.400
 So it takes it in and vomits up its enzymes.

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:12.240
 - It's not true.

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:13.880
 - Yeah, that's true.

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:17.240
 But one problem that they have is at crime scenes

00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:19.520
 because if there's a lot of blood at crime scenes,

00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:21.120
 then flies would have come along

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:22.440
 and they eat a lot of the blood

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.440
 and then they vomit on the walls straight away

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:26.320
 and they create little blood spatters

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:28.360
 and people who are crime scene specialists

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:29.720
 have to know to tell the difference

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:31.440
 and they're looking really close up at blood spatters

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:34.480
 between blood vomited by flies and blood.

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:35.320
 - This is amazing.

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:38.600
 So what you can do is if people check your hands for blood

00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:40.400
 after there's been a crime,

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:42.440
 you can say, "Oh, just a fly landed on it

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:43.760
 and vomited on my hands."

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:45.360
 So I was nowhere near it at the time.

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:46.960
 - And on my shirt and on this fat.

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:48.120
 (all laughing)

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:50.280
 Oh, there's one fly, man and a lie.

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:52.800
 (all laughing)

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:53.720
 - And here.

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:55.520
 - Anyway, here's my witness.

00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:57.920
 (all laughing)

00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:59.800
 - Go on, Derek, tell them how you did it.

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:00.840
 (all laughing)

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:02.440
 - Everybody, Dickie, tell me how many, Derek.

00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:05.440
 (all laughing)

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:08.600
 - And all this cocaine on my hands as well?

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:10.120
 (all laughing)

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:11.120
 - Oh, that's Colin.

00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:12.920
 (all laughing)

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:15.520
 (upbeat music)

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:18.440
 - Okay, that's it.

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:19.560
 That is all of our facts.

00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:21.240
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:22.920

 Goodbye.

00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:08.660
