00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,560
 On the other hand, Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly

2
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,440
 podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.

3
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:29,520
 My name is Dan Schreiber, and I am sitting here with James Harcad, Annotzzytski, and Andrew

4
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,520
 Hunter Murray.

5
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,040
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

6
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:39,240
 from the last seven days, and in a particular order, here we go.

7
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:44,400
 Starting with my fact, my fact this week is that in America, you get traffic jams caused

8
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,400
 by people chasing tornadoes.

9
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:53,040
 These are people who actively get in cars when they hear a tornado out there in the fields,

10
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,080
 and they try and track it and chase after it in buses and cars and so on.

11
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,880
 And it used to be a very niche thing, but then TV shows started happening, and more and

12
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,240
 more people got into it.

13
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,760
 They still quite niche, isn't that?

14
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,480
 Quite niche, but big enough that it's clogging up the roads because thousands of people are

15
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,480
 doing it now.

16
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,480
 And the rural roads as well.

17
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,480
 Yes.

18
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,960
 It's not like you can get there always, sometimes it's just in the middle of a field that

19
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,960
 tornadoes happening.

20
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,640
 I don't really know much about tornadoes, clearly, but...

21
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,280
 I think they don't adhere to roads and fields, and boundaries in general.

22
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,160
 I think they just go where they want to.

23
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,160
 Yeah, it's true.

24
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:32,160
 I met recently in America, someone in Shelbyville, who was talking about training to become a storm

25
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,160
 chaser.

26
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,320
 She does it for a living now, and she was going to be one of these people who were going

27
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,640
 to look for them.

28
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,640
 And it happened.

29
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,480
 Her interest was sparked after her entire house was destroyed.

30
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,480
 Wow.

31
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,480
 Yes.

32
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,880
 So they all have these bunkers in America that they go into for tornado shelter.

33
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,880
 And they don't have enough.

34
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,480
 They're very angry because the government hasn't done enough about it.

35
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,720
 But when you say they all do you mean people in tornado alley?

36
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,720
 Yes, yeah.

37
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,720
 Sorry, what's tornado alley?

38
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,480
 Oh, it's just the area of America where the vast majority of tornadoes happen.

39
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,480
 So it's Kansas kind of area, isn't it?

40
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,480
 Okay, I didn't know that.

41
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,480
 It's the Wizard of Oz.

42
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,480
 The Wizard of Oz.

43
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,480
 Yeah.

44
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,480
 Indeed.

45
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,720
 But so Twister did a lot, the film Twister did a lot for tornado PR, didn't it?

46
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,720
 Yeah.

47
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,720
 That was the big moment, really.

48
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,800
 I think this is where tornado chases first picked up on the idea, and they did loads

49
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,320
 of research and they got really involved with the, you know, government weather systems team,

50
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,280
 whatever they're called, the NOAA, I think.

51
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,920
 And they had lots of scientists on board the film and Bill Paxton got really into it.

52
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,920
 Right.

53
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,840
 And he did a documentary after it about tornadoes, I think.

54
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,040
 But there was a really sweet moment early this year because he died in February.

55
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,040
 That's right.

56
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,680
 And there's this thing called the Spotter Network, which is this online network that all

57
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,800
 tornado chases are on.

58
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,160
 And so the Spotter Network gives a GPS location for where the phone's owner is.

59
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,320
 And so all these tornado chases lined up and spelled out the initials BP up tornado alley.

60
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,320
 It was petroleum.

61
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,320
 Yeah.

62
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,320
 And that was weird.

63
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,320
 Because Bill Paxton had shares in British petroleum.

64
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,320
 Well, exactly.

65
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,320
 Yeah.

66
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,320
 But it was huge.

67
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,120
 So I was looking at, I was looking at the initials and people were tweeting it.

68
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,040
 And there are all these little green dots for where all the tornado chases are spelling

69
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,040
 out BP.

70
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,040
 Yeah.

71
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,720
 I looked at Google Maps and it was a massive amount of space they were covering.

72
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,960
 So the line of the P was 230 miles high.

73
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,960
 Really?

74
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,960
 Yeah.

75
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,960
 Wow.

76
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,960
 I thought it was just in a field or something.

77
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,960
 Yeah.

78
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,960
 But you don't need cars bumper to bumper for 230 miles.

79
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,960
 No.

80
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,960
 You can't just have two cars.

81
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,960
 I'm just checking.

82
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,960
 Yeah.

83
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,760
 What you said about they use GPS, I think that's why this is so popular now, isn't it?

84
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,920
 Because in the olden days, in order to find a tornado, you'd have to go to the weather forecasters

85
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,200
 and you'd have to, you know, be quite an expert.

86
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,200
 And these days, you just need an app on a car.

87
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,200
 Yeah.

88
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,200
 You can just find it.

89
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,200
 Yeah.

90
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,200
 Because you need to know in advance.

91
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,120
 And we just have, we still have really bad tornado forecasting systems, don't we?

92
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,640
 I think the average amount of time between when you're told that there's a tornado coming

93
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,720
 towards you and when you have to be out of your house is 13 minutes.

94
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,720
 Yes.

95
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,720
 Still so.

96
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,600
 So this is the big problem with the storm chases.

97
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,160
 People now, if there is a tornado warning in their area, have to be prepared to leave extra

98
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,720
 early because just trying to flee their houses, they're going to get caught up in the traffic

99
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,640
 of the people actually heading towards the tornado.

100
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,240
 They will be heading the other way.

101
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,040
 They just are, yeah, I guess so, but so it'll be fine.

102
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,040
 Oh, yeah.

103
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,280
 I don't know if you need to turn left or right.

104
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,280
 Yeah, exactly.

105
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,280
 Some roads are.

106
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,280
 Yeah.

107
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,640
 Have you ever seen a disaster movie like everyone goes in the same direction?

108
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,920
 And if you go in in the opposite direction, you might get eaten by Godzilla, but at least

109
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,920
 you can get that quickly.

110
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,920
 Yeah, that's true.

111
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,200
 But no, you can't because everyone's going to film Godzilla because the Godzilla app

112
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,200
 they've got on their phone.

113
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,200
 Yeah.

114
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,280
 To extend as much for too far.

115
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,560
 Speaking of movies, did you say you had a load of trivia before we started?

116
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,400
 That's the fact about Twister, but Anna read it out just now, so was that it?

117
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,400
 The Bill Paxon thing.

118
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,400
 I've got one more.

119
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,400
 Coming on.

120
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,960
 In the film Twister, do you know what the noise of the tornado was?

121
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,160
 Oh, I will give you £1,000 if you guess.

122
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,160
 Was it the camel's moan that was slowed down?

123
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,160
 Yeah.

124
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:07,320
 So like back details, please do read them out, because I need them to get that thousand pounds

125
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,320
 back.

126
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,680
 Yes, it was a camel's moan slowed down.

127
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,280
 How did they make a camel moan?

128
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,960
 That sounds like the start of a joke.

129
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,280
 So the other one bit of trivia about Twister is that it was the first Hollywood movie released

130
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,280
 on DVD.

131
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,280
 Really?

132
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,280
 No.

133
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,280
 That is a good bit of trivia.

134
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,440
 That's cool, because it would have been the first movie to spin as well in order to play

135
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,440
 it.

136
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,440
 Oh, yeah.

137
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,440
 Although the spools of a VHS do spin.

138
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,440
 Oh, damn it.

139
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,440
 You're right.

140
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,440
 Yes.

141
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,440
 Sorry.

142
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,440
 They used to have it in the 1980s, a mobile observatory.

143
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,040
 So these days they have armoured cars and armoured trucks and things.

144
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,360
 Some of them with radar dishes on the back to measure information when the professionals

145
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,360
 do it.

146
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,240
 But in the '80s they had one, which was a massive barrel, and they just had to leave it

147
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,120
 in the path of a tornado, let it gather all the data that way, right?

148
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,360
 The really cool thing was it was called the Toronto-Tornado Observatory, or...

149
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,360
 Oh, Toronto.

150
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,360
 Toto.

151
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,360
 Toto.

152
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,360
 Toto.

153
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,360
 After the dog in the Wizard of Oz.

154
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,360
 Wow.

155
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,360
 How nice is that.

156
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,360
 Not the band.

157
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,360
 After the band, Toto.

158
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,200
 They have the same one in Africa and they called it that after the band.

159
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:18,120
 Do you know that one way to judge how much wind speed there is in a tornado used to be, whether

160
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,800
 it would strip all the feathers off a chicken?

161
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,560
 As if you would have a chicken near one or you would throw a chicken at it?

162
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,920
 They would fire a chicken out of a gun, like a cannon kind of thing towards the tornado

163
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,400
 to see if it would get stripped.

164
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,400
 While it was happening.

165
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,400
 While it was happening, yeah.

166
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,640
 And then you go, "Oh, these chickens have lost all their feathers, so it must have been

167
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,840
 more than 341 miles per hour."

168
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,840
 Oh, OK.

169
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,840
 It is that reliable?

170
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,840
 It's not reliable.

171
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,840
 No, OK.

172
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,760
 And the unreliability of it won a 1997 Ignore Bell Prize.

173
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:55,440
 And it was worked out by Bernard Vonnegut, who's the brother of Kurt Vonnegut.

174
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,440
 Oh, cool.

175
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,440
 And so...

176
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,440
 That's awesome.

177
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,960
 What happened was, they always used to use this system, and then he realised that there

178
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,400
 are reasons why it might not work.

179
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,880
 Because he said that maybe the explosion from the gun might have got rid of all the feathers.

180
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:14,520
 And the other thing is that sometimes chickens have particularly easy to pluck feathers.

181
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,520
 Right.

182
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,520
 It's cold and flight malt.

183
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,160
 And every now and then, like once a year or something, you can pluck them quite easily.

184
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,400
 So if you get them at the wrong time, you might miscalculate the speed.

185
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,400
 Wow.

186
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,360
 I was reading about a different cannon just yesterday, which was meant to fire humans

187
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,360
 out of.

188
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,960
 So it's a human cannonball style cannon.

189
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:39,040
 But the idea was for firefighters and people who needed to get some meetings in other buildings.

190
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,040
 Yeah.

191
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,040
 I never went through.

192
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,040
 I was reading it in a new science book.

193
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,040
 I'm just too surprised me.

194
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,040
 It never went through.

195
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,040
 It was a new scientist book.

196
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,040
 And it was using...

197
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,640
 So it was an air cannon.

198
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,120
 The human was inside.

199
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,000
 And the idea would be for firefighters if they needed to get to a top of a building that

200
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,280
 would have taken too long, they would have been shot out of the air cannon to the top

201
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,280
 of the building.

202
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,160
 Would it not have been a tube that they went through the tube the whole way?

203
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,640
 The word was cannon, yeah.

204
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,640
 So.

205
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,640
 That's interesting.

206
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,160
 So cannons as in human cannonballs, they usually springs rather than...

207
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,160
 So the idea was this was air, propulsion.

208
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,160
 I have never thought.

209
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,640
 I've never considered what actually is the form of propulsion for a human cannonball.

210
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,640
 Well, now you know.

211
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,640
 Now I know.

212
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,640
 I did always sort of assume it was gunpowder.

213
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,640
 Do you?

214
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:23,640
 But it makes no sense.

215
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,320
 Have you guys heard about the proposed Great Wall of Kansas?

216
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,320
 No.

217
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,320
 No.

218
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,320
 This is to stop tornadoes.

219
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,320
 How big is it?

220
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:39,840
 It's a thousand feet high, 150 feet wide, and it would cost 60 billion dollars per 100 miles.

221
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,840
 This was proposed.

222
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,840
 A thousand feet high, yeah.

223
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,520
 This is sort of the Eiffel Tower all the way along.

224
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,760
 This is a physicist from Pennsylvania, I believe.

225
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,760
 He presented this.

226
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,520
 No, an engineer then.

227
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,520
 No.

228
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,520
 No.

229
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:56,720
 He said, "If we build three east-west Great Walls in the American Midwest, this is a three

230
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,720
 wall."

231
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,920
 So one in North Dakota, one along the border between Kansas and Oklahoma to the east and the

232
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:07,040
 third one in South Texas and Louisiana, we will diminish the tornado threats in tornado

233
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,800
 alley forever.

234
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,480
 And he was presenting that research in 2014 to the annual meeting of American Physical

235
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,560
 Society in Denver.

236
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,240
 Everyone said it's nonsense, obviously.

237
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,920
 But he believes that it's a similar thing with mountain ranges and how they concurred

238
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,920
 tornadoes.

239
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,440
 That's the idea behind it.

240
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,520
 Let's tell you what, if you're a teenager in America and you're looking for a new career,

241
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,560
 be a massive wall builder, because it seems like, "Oh, yeah, yeah."

242
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,560
 It's your idea.

243
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,360
 I think if Donald Trump can't pass a 20-foot high wall, then I think the odds are passing

244
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,960
 a thousand foot high wall.

245
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,680
 Hey, do you want to hear about an eclipse, Tracer?

246
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,680
 Yeah.

247
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,680
 Yeah.

248
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,680
 Two out of three.

249
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,680
 Yes, please, Andy.

250
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,680
 Yes.

251
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,680
 Quorum.

252
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,040
 No, there are these people.

253
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,680
 So America is about to have a massive eclipse on the 21st of August.

254
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,960
 It's going to pass across a huge band of America.

255
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:05,440
 And I think 88 million Americans live within 200 miles, and a lot of those people are expected

256
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,320
 to move towards this band as it moves.

257
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,320
 OK.

258
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,600
 But there are certain people who spend their whole lives, all their life savings, everything

259
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,320
 seeing eclipses around the world.

260
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:18,400
 And one of them is a guy called Mike Kentrianakis, and he works for the American Astronomical Society,

261
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,520
 which is good, because before that, he was bankrupting himself, traveling around the

262
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,880
 world, seeing eclipses.

263
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,480
 One of his marriages, I think it may be his first marriage, broke down partly because his

264
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,600
 wife didn't want him to go to Argentina to see an eclipse.

265
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,680
 Would she not let him see his son?

266
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,680
 Oh!

267
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,680
 Hey, oh!

268
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,680
 Very good.

269
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,680
 That's very good.

270
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:41,720
 But it's got a heartening end, because now he's got this job, and he gets paid to go to

271
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,720
 all the eclipses.

272
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,720
 Yeah, that's really cool.

273
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,720
 Or he was spending all his money doing it.

274
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,720
 Yeah.

275
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,720
 His marriage is still over, isn't it?

276
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,720
 Yeah.

277
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,760
 I guess if you're purely driven by money, fine.

278
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,680
 But if there are things more important in life, he's lost his family.

279
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,680
 No, no, no, no, no.

280
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,720
 I mean, he may have found love again, we don't know.

281
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,520
 But he said they had other problems as well, but this was just an indication that she wasn't

282
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,920
 able to support the thing he loves more than any other.

283
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,920
 Yeah.

284
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,960
 What a weird, I mean, once you see an eclipse, you've seen them all, haven't you?

285
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,960
 Apparently, it's an incredible experience, and some people, for the first time they experience

286
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,440
 it, that's all they ever want to do again.

287
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,440
 Yeah.

288
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,960
 So do you all remember when we had one in the UK?

289
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,960
 Yeah.

290
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,960
 It was fine.

291
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,960
 Yeah, it was okay, wasn't it?

292
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,960
 Was it total?

293
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,960
 Yes.

294
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,760
 I think it was cloudy and bit of London.

295
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,160
 Yeah, and the bit where I was, I was in Sheffield, it wasn't quite total there.

296
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,560
 But it was pretty total.

297
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,560
 I think you had to go to like the silly islands or something.

298
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,160
 Yeah, I was in Cornwall, where it was total, but it was quite cloudy.

299
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,160
 So it was.

300
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,760
 I think we've probably said this quote on the show before, but it's worth saying again.

301
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:42,760
 It was Ian M. Banks who said that if aliens did ever visit us, it would be to watch an

302
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,800
 eclipse, a total solar eclipse, because the rarity it must be in the universe of having

303
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,360
 a moon and a sun the exact same size that that could happen.

304
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,360
 It's a tourist attraction.

305
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,000
 That's why they would come to earth.

306
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 It's come for the eclipse.

307
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 Stay for the Kardashians.

308
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 Yeah.

309
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:05,800
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Andy.

310
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:10,600
 My fact is, there is a special quarantine centre for chocolate in the English countryside.

311
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,640
 Yeah, this is incredible.

312
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,640
 It is.

313
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,640
 It's amazing.

314
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:19,040
 It's a place in Reading and it's called the International Coco quarantine centre or the

315
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:27,520
 ICQC and it's got about 400 different varieties of cocoa plants all in massive greenhouses and

316
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:32,400
 scientists observe them every week and they more of them come around every month and they

317
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:37,080
 do special checks on them and basically it's because if you're moving cocoa from one

318
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:41,160
 country to another, there's a real risk that a disease will move from one country to

319
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,160
 another.

320
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,760
 The new blight made it to West Africa where loads of the world's cocoa is grown and it's

321
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,520
 a massive plant for their economy.

322
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:52,400
 That could cause massive hardship, distress and disaster.

323
00:12:52,400 --> 00:13:00,520
 So every variety moving around the world spends two years in quarantine at the ICQC in Reading.

324
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,520
 Right.

325
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,520
 Yeah.

326
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,520
 And it's quite, is it quite new?

327
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,520
 Was it built a few years ago?

328
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:08,760
 No, it's been going since 1985 but they've got a new home since 2015.

329
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,760
 Okay.

330
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,760
 Yeah, yeah.

331
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:16,080
 Sorry, just so I can wrap my head round this, they're collecting the cocoa plants from around

332
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,600
 the world to sit there to put through quarantine.

333
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,600
 It's not chocolate bars.

334
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,600
 It's not.

335
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,160
 That's why all the chocolate you eat is off now.

336
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,600
 But what I mean is, if a new plant is going to be used or if they're going to use it from

337
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:35,440
 mass shipment, they have to then send samples to these guys or you have to send, you send

338
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,400
 the budwood, which is a little length of branch with a bud sprouting, right?

339
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,840
 They put it in an insect-proof cage, just in case it's got an insect, which carries disease

340
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,560
 on it for a couple of months.

341
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,360
 Then they grow it, they grow a clone, that's called an indicator of a rifle.

342
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,840
 And then if after two years the plant is completely free of disease, it's allowed to go

343
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,200
 on to the place it was going to go to in the first place.

344
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,200
 So if you ever want to send cocoa from one part of the world to the other, it has to go

345
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,200
 through Reading.

346
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,200
 Exactly.

347
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,200
 Wow.

348
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,200
 It's like getting a train to Bristol, isn't it?

349
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:12,480
 And also looking at photos of this place, it looked a bit like, I assume they keep elements

350
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,960
 of the cocoa that's been sent to them, they don't just send out the whole thing.

351
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:23,000
 It looks like it's a, the life raft of endangered cocoa plants, it's the one true spot that we

352
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,400
 know we're preserving them.

353
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,400
 Yeah.

354
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,800
 It makes it, nothing makes me feel patriotic usually, but reading about this, I thought,

355
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,280
 wow, we are so special.

356
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,840
 We in Britain are saving the world's chocolate.

357
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,840
 That's a big deal.

358
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,840
 It's really impressive.

359
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,840
 And the world's chocolate is kind of under threat, isn't it?

360
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:43,480
 So the demand is massively exceeding supply at the moment and we're running out of cocoa

361
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,480
 plants.

362
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,480
 They're really hard to farm.

363
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:51,600
 So I think only 30% of them, if you have a cocoa farm, only 30% of your plants will actually

364
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,440
 flower and create the cocoa, because there are so many pests.

365
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,440
 Yeah.

366
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,560
 They've got these diseases with really cool names, like frosty pod and witch's broom.

367
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:04,720
 So there's a list on Wikipedia of all these diseases, and a lot of them have the

368
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,000
 word "pod" at the end, like frosty pod.

369
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,760
 And so do a lot of podcasts.

370
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:16,880
 So I wonder if you can tell me whether these cocoa disease or podcasts.

371
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:23,320
 So frosty pod, you said, black pod, oh, I disease, podcast.

372
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,320
 Disease.

373
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,160
 It's a disease, ghost pod.

374
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,160
 Podcast.

375
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:39,640
 Does it be either, it really does disease, it's a podcast, two for two, chicken pop pod.

376
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,640
 Disease.

377
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,640
 Disease.

378
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,640
 Podcast.

379
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,640
 What?

380
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,640
 So comedy podcast.

381
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,640
 Mealy pod.

382
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,640
 Disease.

383
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,640
 Disease.

384
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,640
 Disease.

385
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,640
 A podcast.

386
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,640
 It's a disease.

387
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:55,720
 And I got a million more of those, but that was the end of the game.

388
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,840
 They're just the four that were sponsored by this week.

389
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,840
 Oh, that was a very exciting game.

390
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,840
 I had a game before.

391
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,640
 I just have a game every time.

392
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,640
 Yeah, that's great.

393
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:07,280
 So this place was, this is how important this is to the chocolate industry.

394
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:12,400
 It was funded mutually by a large group of the biggest chocolate makers in the world

395
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:17,480
 from Cadbury through to Mars, through to Willy Wonka, through to, no, he doesn't exist.

396
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,480
 That was a game.

397
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,480
 Well, there is Willy Wonka.

398
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,480
 Candy, they bought.

399
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,480
 There's a brand.

400
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,480
 Yeah.

401
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,480
 Oh, then it could be.

402
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,800
 Well, then very, very well, maybe an investor in this place.

403
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,240
 Anna, does this still make you feel really patriotic that our country is doing this?

404
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,560
 Well, actually, it's just a load of multi-nationers.

405
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:36,800
 It's gradually seeping away my nascent nationalism, sure.

406
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,680
 Just quickly, do you know why this cocoa chocolate quarantine centre is in Reading?

407
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,840
 Oh, no.

408
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:47,120
 Well, Reading was their football team's called The Biscuit Men, so there's a biscuit company

409
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,120
 there.

410
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,120
 Exactly.

411
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,120
 It's for the chocolate biscuit.

412
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,120
 No, sadly, it's not that.

413
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:57,800
 It's because it's so cold in Britain and particularly Reading that none of the diseases

414
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:02,120
 which they're potentially harboring in the centre could survive outside in the wilds

415
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,520
 of the countryside around Reading.

416
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,520
 It's that, yeah.

417
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:08,080
 Yeah, so well, that's why it's in Britain, basically, Reading is an afterthought.

418
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:12,120
 So, this is really common with other crops as well, isn't it?

419
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,720
 There are various other things that get quarantined in countries that are the opposite of where

420
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,720
 they came from.

421
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,600
 It's like going on a gap, yeah.

422
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,120
 You go somewhere as different as you can to your home country.

423
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,480
 So, I think bananas, most bananas spend some time in Belgium in transit.

424
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,160
 Coffee goes to Portugal and spend some time being in Portugal.

425
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,160
 And yeah, it has to be places where the usual pests of those crops won't survive in that

426
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,160
 climate.

427
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,160
 Portugal, though, as well.

428
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,160
 It's quite warm, isn't it?

429
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,160
 Is it?

430
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,160
 Yeah.

431
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,160
 Because, simply, it's come from, like, Brazil or somewhere.

432
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,160
 Not the opposite of Brazil, is it?

433
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,160
 It's not.

434
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,160
 It's very much not.

435
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,160
 It's not the exact opposite.

436
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,160
 You're right.

437
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,760
 But I use the colonial oppressor of Brazil of anything.

438
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,800
 Are you sending every banana there?

439
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,800
 No!

440
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,800
 No!

441
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,800
 No!

442
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,800
 No!

443
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:00,240
 Not every chocolate bar goes to redding.

444
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:06,400
 You can just listen back to Andy's explanation at the start when you hear this.

445
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:12,640
 Do you know what the most expensive chocolate ever sold for is, and this is in terms of-

446
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,640
 Okay.

447
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,640
 Do you want the price or what's in the chocolate or-

448
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,360
 Maybe price and what the chocolate was.

449
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,360
 Was it a-

450
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,360
 Okay.

451
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,160
 I'll say a million pounds, and it was a bar of flexed with gold.

452
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,160
 Yeah.

453
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,760
 This is a hard one because I think there probably are more expensive chocolates on the market.

454
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,400
 So this was sold at Christie's Auction House.

455
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,400
 Okay.

456
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,400
 Okay.

457
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,400
 So it was a historical piece of chocolate.

458
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,400
 Yes.

459
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,400
 It was something that Mallory took up ever.

460
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,400
 Very close.

461
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,000
 You're totally in the territory in that it's exploration.

462
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,600
 Is it Chacolton took to the south?

463
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,600
 So close.

464
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,600
 It's exactly in the-

465
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,600
 Yes.

466
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,600
 Scott.

467
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,600
 It's like a diddle the hardware.

468
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:55,400
 Scott's first expedition to the Antarctic in the early 1900s, and how much did his bar?

469
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,840
 It's one little lump of chocolates.

470
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,040
 Was it made of gold as well?

471
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,040
 No.

472
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,040
 No, it was just made of chocolate.

473
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,040
 Yeah.

474
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,040
 20,000 pounds.

475
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,040
 No.

476
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:08,640
 I'll go for a bar of chocolate, £7,984.

477
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,640
 Okay.

478
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,480
 I think, actually, less than, I think £4,500.

479
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,480
 £470.

480
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,480
 Oh, okay.

481
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,480
 Yeah.

482
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,480
 I've never shot it.

483
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,480
 20,000 was way off, wasn't it?

484
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,480
 Yeah.

485
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,240
 But I would have thought 20,000 was more in the ballpark of something that is attached to an extraordinarily

486
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,240
 historically important trip.

487
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,640
 The thing is, I bet they did an auction with lots of different things from his expedition.

488
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,640
 They did.

489
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,160
 And this was probably the shittiest one of the lots.

490
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,160
 Yes.

491
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,160
 His diaries went and they went for £600, so-

492
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,160
 £600?

493
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,160
 No, of course not.

494
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,000
 No, they were like £90,000, £200,000, something like that.

495
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,800
 So this is for the one person who couldn't get anything else in the light.

496
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,800
 I'll just get the chocolate.

497
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,800
 Yeah, just, yeah.

498
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,800
 I'll bring the chocolate out.

499
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,800
 With something to eat on the way out.

500
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,800
 Yeah.

501
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,800
 Exactly.

502
00:19:54,800 --> 00:20:00,720
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Chisinski.

503
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:06,520
 Yep, my fact is that, to celebrate the Communist Revolution, the Bolsheviks plan to build a tower

504
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:11,000
 in St. Petersburg that projected the news onto the clouds.

505
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 Oh.

506
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,520
 And this was this really cool idea, it was part of, so as soon as the Bolshevik Revolution

507
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,480
 happened, Lenin launched this thing called the monumental propaganda campaign.

508
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:23,480
 And the idea was to build all these monuments, it's quite a clever pun when it's translated

509
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,480
 into English.

510
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,680
 But the idea was to build all these monuments, which were a big piece of Soviet propaganda.

511
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:34,680
 And this guy was commissioned, this architect called Tatlin, Vladimir Tatlin, was commissioned

512
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:39,040
 to design something that was going to be called the Monument to the Third International.

513
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:44,560
 And so in 1919 he designed this insane building, which is, it's often called the most influential

514
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,080
 building that was never built.

515
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,080
 Wow.

516
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:51,760
 Because it's inspired lots of artists and designers ever since, and it's just really fascinating.

517
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,800
 And it was going to be 400 meters tall, it was going to be made of steel and glass and

518
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,800
 iron.

519
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,800
 It was this double helix structure, so it looks like a spiral on the way up.

520
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,280
 And it had these amazing features, so various bits of it rotated.

521
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,160
 These huge glass cubes were then it rotated at different speeds.

522
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:14,120
 And there was a plan on the top bit to have this information center, which would issue

523
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:20,640
 news bulletins that in the night time, or on a cloudy day, shot up into the sky and broadcast

524
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,640
 in light the news announcements or propaganda onto the sky, onto the clouds.

525
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,640
 It's very cool.

526
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,640
 It's very cool.

527
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,640
 I think people might be familiar with this tower, because it's quite a famous iconic thing.

528
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:36,840
 They had a replica of it in the Royal Academy last year or the year before, I think.

529
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,840
 I don't know.

530
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,680
 And it looks a little bit like the tower at the Olympic Park.

531
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,680
 It does.

532
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,680
 That's exactly what I was thinking.

533
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:47,880
 And often if you see any kind of old pictures of Soviet Russia from the 1920s, this is

534
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,720
 kind of an iconic image, right?

535
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,720
 Yeah.

536
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,240
 And they used it and it kind of represented their ambition.

537
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,480
 So it was used as a Soviet icon in the '50s and '60s to show how great they were.

538
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,720
 Wait, so this building wasn't built, but all the plans and the drawings were released.

539
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,720
 Yes.

540
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,160
 We've then sort of subtly built it without...

541
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,160
 They've built it.

542
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,160
 At the time even, they built a lot of smaller versions of it.

543
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,160
 Okay.

544
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:13,240
 So it was so massive that there's no, it was impossible to build basically.

545
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:17,320
 They wouldn't be able to get enough iron, they wouldn't be able to get enough steel.

546
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,000
 And for something, yeah, that was supposed to be like a building, something which has a real

547
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,400
 social purpose, but the fact is that it was impossible for them to make any work.

548
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,400
 Yeah.

549
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,760
 Pretty ironic, guys.

550
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,640
 Considering what happened with the communism.

551
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,640
 Yeah.

552
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,640
 Good.

553
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,640
 Right.

554
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,640
 Communist anti-communist asylum.

555
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,640
 Nice idea.

556
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,640
 But...

557
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,640
 Doesn't work in practice.

558
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,640
 Right.

559
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,640
 Yeah, it doesn't work in practice.

560
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,640
 It doesn't get off the ground.

561
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,320
 No, the thing is, Anna, has never been properly tried.

562
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,320
 That's the problem.

563
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,320
 It's just tried in the wrong place.

564
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,320
 It was the wrong environment.

565
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,320
 It was the wrong environment.

566
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,320
 It was the wrong environment.

567
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,320
 It was the wrong environment.

568
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,320
 It was the wrong environment.

569
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,320
 It was the wrong environment.

570
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,320
 It was the wrong environment.

571
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,320
 It was the wrong environment.

572
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,320
 It was the wrong environment.

573
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,320
 It was the wrong environment.

574
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,320
 It was the wrong environment.

575
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,320
 It was the wrong environment.

576
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,320
 It was the wrong environment.

577
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,320
 It was the wrong environment.

578
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,320
 It was the wrong environment.

579
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,320
 It was the wrong environment.

580
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,320
 Yeah.

581
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,320
 It was the wrong environment.

582
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,320
 It was the wrong environment.

583
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,320
 It was the wrong environment.

584
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,320
 building or was the whole of the building revolving?

585
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,160
 - So there were different layers of the building

586
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,080
 and it would revolve at different rates.

587
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,880
 So one of them would revolve once a day

588
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,320
 and another one would be once a week

589
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,600
 and another one would be once a month.

590
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,280
 And then the bottom one would be,

591
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,040
 I think the bottom one would be once a year,

592
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,480
 it would revolve. - Wow.

593
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,600
 - And so you'd be able to tell what date and time it was by.

594
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,520
 - It was a giant calendar. - It made a plot.

595
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,640
 - And it was in a double helix as well.

596
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,720
 Even though the structure of DNA hadn't been,

597
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,560
 I think, discovered at this time,

598
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,080
 the whole around the cylinder and the cube

599
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,480
 and the pyramid and everything that was this huge double helix.

600
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,120
 - Yeah, there's this one guy who's written

601
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,520
 a big kind of biography of this building

602
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,880
 who says that it was never intended to be built.

603
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,480
 So some people think that it was just a thing

604
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,920
 that was meant to represent, I don't know,

605
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,000
 the ambition or the symbolism of the new Soviet Russia

606
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,920
 that it wasn't meant to be built, but we don't know.

607
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,320
 - The news in the clouds is that a,

608
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,360
 was scientifically, is that a practical thing?

609
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,280
 I'm purely thinking it is out of the fact

610
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,480
 that the Batman logo can be put into the sky.

611
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,400
 - I know that is a good documentary.

612
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,320
 - Yeah, and with sequels, but I don't think it was.

613
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,880
 So this is the thing I had no idea

614
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,720
 that they weren't trying experimenting

615
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,920
 with these wildly technologically advanced ideas,

616
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,400
 but I don't think that was practical.

617
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,080
 - It is practical. - At the time, now.

618
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,360
 - Yeah. - Because there was a guy

619
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,000
 in Nottingham called Dave Lynch

620
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 and he fired a ghost rider onto the clouds

621
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,320
 in Nottingham a few years ago.

622
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,920
 - Okay. - A ghost rider.

623
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,480
 - Yeah, so it's like a ghostly horse rider guy.

624
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,920
 - Oh, cool. - And it was a bit like my bridges,

625
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,160
 if you know that old, one of the first animations

626
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,440
 of the like a galloping horse. - Yeah, yeah.

627
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,800
 - It literally was that.

628
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,680
 - It used exactly the same projector as my bridge, didn't it?

629
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,640
 But it used a laser instead of light.

630
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,760
 - But there's quite a long way to go

631
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,240
 until we can watch Liar Liar on a cloud.

632
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,720
 - Is it? - Yeah, right.

633
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,960
 - Because it's done with the laser,

634
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,760
 so it's all in the green light of the laser.

635
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,200
 - But what they were originally doing was the news.

636
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,960
 So maybe it would be less difficult

637
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,520
 to put like Kay Berlion than Liar Liar

638
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,120
 because she's only in one studio.

639
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,520
 - That's true. - Mm-hmm.

640
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,800
 - Did I miss a reference?

641
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,640
 Why are we using a Jim Carey movie from--

642
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,480
 - It's just a wrap.

643
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,360
 - Sorry, I just tried to think of a really good film.

644
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,200
 - Yeah.

645
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,840
 - You came over my head. - Okay, cool.

646
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,000
 Sorry, I thought I missed a reference

647
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,400
 for that was just absolutely did not.

648
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,240
 - Okay.

649
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,960
 - That was just crowbarring in a movie.

650
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,840
 - You're choice a movie to play

651
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,680
 into the clouds with Liar Liar.

652
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,680
 - So it's just been half the book.

653
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,720
 I was talking about twist already.

654
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,680
 - What would you put into the clouds?

655
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:26,200
 - I just, well, a latest movie, the new Spider-Man,

656
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,200
 or a Game of Thrones episode.

657
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,240
 - But here's the thing about that.

658
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,320
 If you put the latest Spider-Man in,

659
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,560
 then no one's gonna go to the cinema

660
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,640
 'cause they can just watch it in the clouds, right?

661
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,920
 But if you put Liar Liar on,

662
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,600
 which is probably on terrestrial TV

663
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,240
 pretty much once a year or something,

664
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,160
 then it's fine, you don't lose any money.

665
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,600
 - I want a day, I want a day in my flat.

666
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,440
 - So yeah.

667
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,800
 (laughing)

668
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,720
 And also down, when people listen to this podcast

669
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,720
 did a few months, they'll go,

670
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,280
 "New Spider-Man, what's that?"

671
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,120
 - Yeah.

672
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:50,960
 - Whereas Liar Liar is one of the--

673
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,800
 - It's timeless.

674
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,520
 - Well, yeah, that's a movie there.

675
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,000
 Induros.

676
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,520
 You were talking about the bat signal.

677
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,440
 - Yes, I was, yeah.

678
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,240
 - Do you know how they summon Batman on a cloudless night?

679
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,800
 - So they project it onto the moon?

680
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,800
 - They project it.

681
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,960
 - Or a star.

682
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,680
 - They project it onto a star.

683
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,520
 - Do they just call them?

684
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,240
 Does he just probably go on a phone?

685
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,960
 - Well, there is the bat phone, is there?

686
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,160
 - No, it's none of these things.

687
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,960
 Supposedly, I mean, this is, it's all made up.

688
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,800
 - Side of a building.

689
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,880
 - Side of a building.

690
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,720
 - Is it?

691
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,560
 - Yes.

692
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,560
 - How come we've never seen that?

693
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,920
 Is it just very bad weather in Gotham City most of the time?

694
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,040
 - Yeah, I think so.

695
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,640
 And someone, but someone incredibly geeky

696
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,640
 on Quora pointed out, actually, 'cause Gotham is near water,

697
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,920
 it's liable to have more cloud,

698
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,080
 'cause they'll be, you know, water rising.

699
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,680
 I don't know how true that it's weather-wise, but.

700
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,680
 - Also smart.

701
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,520
 - Yeah.

702
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,600
 - Probably for them, it's quite good to have bad pollution.

703
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,600
 - Yes.

704
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,160
 - Is it quite polluted Gotham City?

705
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,000
 - Yeah, it's not.

706
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,760
 - The Batmobile is diesel, I think, isn't it?

707
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,760
 So that's what it is.

708
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,920
 (all laughing)

709
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,120
 - It was so embarrassing that time,

710
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,920
 you accidentally filled it up with odd weather.

711
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,800
 (all laughing)

712
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,280
 - That was Robin that did that.

713
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,120
 - That's why he's never allowed to take it out anymore.

714
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,280
 (all laughing)

715
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,560
 - So the tallest building ever envisioned

716
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:05,760
 was the X-seed 4000, and it was gonna be in Tokyo,

717
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,360
 and it was gonna be four kilometers high,

718
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,800
 pretty much in the shape of Mt. Fuji,

719
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,320
 and it would be able to accommodate

720
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,880
 between half a million and one million people.

721
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,080
 - Wow. - Wow.

722
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,680
 - And they did the kind of plans for this,

723
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,200
 but never built it.

724
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,200
 - Why not unrealistic again?

725
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,360
 - Well, according to the managing director

726
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,160
 of buildings and data, George Binder,

727
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,360
 he says that they never really meant to build it.

728
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,960
 The purpose was to earn some recognition for the firm.

729
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,520
 - Yeah, all these people claiming.

730
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,760
 - No, we never really meant to build it.

731
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,760
 - They're always saying this.

732
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,480
 - And they reckon it would have cost

733
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,480
 minimum of about $500 billion US dollars to make it.

734
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,000
 But from the other fact, I saw that we eat

735
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,080
 about $100 billion a year on chocolate,

736
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,360
 so we'd only have to give up chocolate as a world

737
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,880
 for five years, and we'd be able to build this tower.

738
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,720
 - Cool.

739
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,440
 - I don't, no, that's not what I thought at all.

740
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,280
 - Why not?

741
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,720
 - I think the vast majority of people in the world

742
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,800
 would vote to keep chocolate

743
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,840
 and not have a random tower build somewhere in Japan.

744
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,000
 - No, but we would be saving chocolate potentially.

745
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 We would replenish the stock.

746
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,880
 We would perhaps allow for the leaves to breathe a bit.

747
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,200
 - Not for the odds of it, you get a lot less chocolate grown

748
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,200
 if everyone stops eating it.

749
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,000
 So actually, the stocks would crash then.

750
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,840
 - Yeah.

751
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,400
 There was another Soviet building

752
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,720
 that was supposed to be built was the thing

753
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,960
 that was going to replace the 19th Central Cathedral

754
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,920
 of Christ the Saviour, which was like Sonicless,

755
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,320
 the first huge landmark in St Petersburg,

756
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,960
 what became Petrograd and then Leningrad.

757
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:37,640
 And so the plan was to build this amazing skyscraper

758
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,480
 that was going to be, it looked like a huge wedding cake,

759
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,240
 and on top of it was going to have an 80 meter high statue

760
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,920
 of Lenin, and in his head was going to be a library,

761
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,120
 a Soviet library.

762
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,440
 And it was, again, it was kind of a ridiculous plan,

763
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,760
 but they flattened the Zara's Cathedral.

764
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,760
 So they said, "We'll get ready for that."

765
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,160
 And then the USSR ran out of money,

766
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,360
 so that just remained flat.

767
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,520
 And all it became was the world's largest open-air swimming pool.

768
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,360
 - Oh.

769
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,640
 - Which is kind of cooler than a giant Lenin head.

770
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,880
 - The designs were amazing for,

771
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,800
 I remember seeing the designs for that building.

772
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,640
 - For Lenin head building.

773
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,200
 - Yeah, would the Lenin head building

774
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,680
 have had a massive swimming pool where his bladder would have been?

775
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,160
 (laughing)

776
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,720
 - That's not re-appealing, is it?

777
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,960
 Because of the associations.

778
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,800
 - Why not?

779
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,800
 - Don't know, it'd be fun.

780
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,840
 - A patriotic Soviet bladder.

781
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,680
 - I guess.

782
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,680
 - Probably encourage you to be in it.

783
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,520
 - It would.

784
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,040
 The associations of the word bladder.

785
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:25,880
 - That's true.

786
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,440
 - And you can have a watershoot coming out.

787
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,280
 - Moving out.

788
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,120
 - Your re-trap.

789
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,360
 (laughing)

790
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,200
 - So great.

791
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,200
 - I like this plan more and more.

792
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,040
 The more I think about it, properly.

793
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,840
 - But if you've got a watershoot coming out,

794
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,080
 the bladder's behind that.

795
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,160
 So when you come out of the end of the re-trap,

796
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,520
 you just fly into midair, right?

797
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,200
 - Yeah, you just launch back into the city.

798
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,040
 - You launch it.

799
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:46,880
 - You're not uncomfortable.

800
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,640
 - And you're designed for all these cannons

801
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,720
 that fire fighters up to the top of buildings.

802
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,560
 - I don't think we should give up on it,

803
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,480
 but let's park it.

804
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,480
 (laughing)

805
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,480
 - Let's park it for now.

806
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,060
 (upbeat music)

807
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:04,680
 - Okay, it is time for a final fact

808
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,200
 to the show, and that is James.

809
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,480
 - Okay, my fact this week is that caterpillars

810
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,480
 are more likely to vomit when they're on their own.

811
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,520
 - Right.

812
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,440
 - We all throw up when we're lonely, come on.

813
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,120
 - Well, is that why they do it?

814
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,920
 - Then I don't know if they're lonely,

815
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,960
 but the reason that they vomit is to get rid of predators,

816
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,880
 because predators don't like being vomited on.

817
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,680
 And when they're in a group,

818
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,360
 they don't need to do it because they're in a group.

819
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,560
 And actually one of their mates can vomit instead.

820
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,320
 And so what happens is if you vomit,

821
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,040
 it's bad for you 'cause you get rid of your nutrition

822
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,040
 and you need that food.

823
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,000
 But if you're in a group and someone else vomits,

824
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,600
 then it gets rid of the predator

825
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,880
 and you've still got all of your food inside you.

826
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,400
 And so a study was done in 2012

827
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,000
 that found that this caterpillar

828
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,480
 of the large white butterfly,

829
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,320
 they are more likely when they're in a group

830
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,880
 to try and cheat and let someone else do the vomiting.

831
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,800
 - Oh, wow.

832
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,880
 - But what if they all think that?

833
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,320
 This is typical selfish, individualistic 21st century society.

834
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:07,000
 If you all think someone else will pick up that rubbish,

835
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,840
 then no one's gonna do it.

836
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,800
 - That's why caterpillars need to go back

837
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,040
 to a Soviet sister.

838
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,800
 - Yeah, I think that last fact

839
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,920
 really infected you a bit, isn't it?

840
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,560
 - It's amazing how they're all waiting for the other guy

841
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,920
 to get the round in basically.

842
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,920
 - Yeah.

843
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,760
 - I'm just really sorry.

844
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,400
 I've just been working out the caterpillar.

845
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,000
 It is very almost an unagram of capitalist, isn't it?

846
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,800
 So it's no wonder they brought down

847
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:30,080
 the Soviet system with their self-serving ways.

848
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,760
 There's, did you see the caterpillar they found?

849
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,960
 I think last year or the year before,

850
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,960
 it was in Peru and it's from the Nomata Campo genus.

851
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,240
 It was in the Amazon.

852
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,160
 And it responds if you shouted it.

853
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,720
 It doesn't like being shouted at.

854
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,000
 And it's got these tentacles on its back.

855
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,280
 And there's a film of it.

856
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,840
 And if you just yell at the caterpillar like that,

857
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,320
 then it's tentacles just flick out straight away.

858
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,760
 So it's like, you know, when you're talking to a microphone

859
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,840
 and you watch the sound waves go up and down as you do,

860
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,960
 it's like that.

861
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,280
 As soon as you yell at it,

862
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,920
 it fires out these long tentacles from its back.

863
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,160
 - But is it scarier or is it attacking you?

864
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,320
 - We have no idea why it does that.

865
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:09,440
 - Because you use it as a way of measuring sound, couldn't you?

866
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,280
 - You absolutely could.

867
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,040
 - You could use it like as a clapometer or something.

868
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:13,880
 - Yes.

869
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,240
 - If you want to know who's the most popular,

870
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,200
 you get them to applaud and then you have loads

871
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,400
 of these little caterpillars.

872
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,840
 And the longer their tentacles go out, the more popular you are.

873
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,680
 - Wow.

874
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,520
 - That would be so cool.

875
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,120
 Until the RSPCA got onto you,

876
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:27,120
 that would be unbelievably cool to have a mass of caterpillars.

877
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,200
 - But you could do it on like Britain's Got Talent,

878
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,640
 instead of having the judges,

879
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,720
 just have audience reactions.

880
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,560
 - Yeah.

881
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,960
 - Well, in the chairs, they're all caterpillars.

882
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,800
 - Yeah.

883
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,600
 - I do like that, actually.

884
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,680
 I would watch.

885
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,280
 - And the longer the tentacle, the more they like it.

886
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,120
 - Yeah.

887
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:42,960
 - You measure the tentacles.

888
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,120
 - But we don't yet know if they like it or not.

889
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,240
 So the worst acts might get through.

890
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,680
 - Yeah, it's actually just the loudest acts.

891
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,960
 - Yeah, but it's not the loudest audience response.

892
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,200
 - Yeah, sorry, sorry.

893
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,480
 So they're not in the judges seat.

894
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,320
 Sorry, they're the audience.

895
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,480
 - It's much more democratic than Britain's Got Talent.

896
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,600
 - No, they are in the judges seats.

897
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,680
 The caterpillars aren't the audience,

898
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,080
 because you need an audience to make the noise.

899
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,080
 - So sorry.

900
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,760
 - Yeah, but booze are noises as well.

901
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,600
 - Oh, yeah.

902
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,440
 - Yeah.

903
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,240
 - You're so right.

904
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,840
 - Actually, there'd been many times

905
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,120
 doing stand-up, I'd be very grateful

906
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,080
 for the fact that booze are also noise.

907
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,080
 (all laughing)

908
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,040
 - How did the sugar go, Andy?

909
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,200
 Well, they were very loud.

910
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,040
 (all laughing)

911
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,320
 - More vomiting caterpillars?

912
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,160
 - Yes, please.

913
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:27,680
 - The caterpillars of the small, muttled willow moth.

914
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,160
 They vomit, not just what's in the stomach,

915
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,360
 but also kind of a detergent.

916
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,560
 And they do this onto ants.

917
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,920
 And the reason being that they have a lot

918
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,440
 of kind of water in their stomach.

919
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,240
 So when they vomit it onto the ants,

920
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,480
 this detergent kind of stops the surface tension

921
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,560
 of the water from being a blob on the ants' head.

922
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,840
 And instead, the water goes all over the ants,

923
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,440
 and then he has to kind of clean it off

924
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,680
 otherwise he'll drown.

925
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,520
 - Oh wow.

926
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:55,480
 - And so, yeah, it's amazing.

927
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,640
 - I thought you meant like a detergent,

928
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,400
 like if I had a big boozy night out, I'd vomit

929
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,520
 and be like, I need to clean that up.

930
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,480
 Oh no, I don't.

931
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,760
 It's just cleaned itself up.

932
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,560
 (all laughing)

933
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,240
 That would be a great bit of evolution.

934
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,480
 - Yeah, I think if you just had to vomit

935
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,560
 into the washing machine before you guys did.

936
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,760
 (all laughing)

937
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,080
 - Did you know that, so really about caterpillar vomit,

938
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,880
 the evolutionary biologist and a lot of the articles

939
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:20,000
 who studies caterpillars vomiting is called Jane Yak.

940
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,240
 (all laughing)

941
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,280
 - No, that's not a good one.

942
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,080
 - There is a species of caterpillar

943
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,680
 that lives on coca leaves.

944
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,280
 And when they vomit on predators,

945
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,520
 the vomit contains cocaine.

946
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,360
 - Whoa.

947
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,200
 - Whoa.

948
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,760
 - Which presumably the predators don't like

949
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,760
 for whatever reason.

950
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,600
 - Right.

951
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,640
 - But it itself is not high all the time

952
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,240
 on cocaine for the eating it.

953
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,640
 - Yeah, so it doesn't metabolize the cocaine

954
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,040
 to make it go crazy.

955
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:45,880
 - Yeah.

956
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,040
 - But when it's eaten by the predators,

957
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,080
 something happens to them and they don't like it.

958
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:53,680
 - But is it worth, if you find, where is this?

959
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,640
 - I don't know, but it must be where coca leaves grow,

960
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,480
 so South America.

961
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,320
 - Somewhere in South America.

962
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,320
 (all laughing)

963
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,200
 - That's so cool.

964
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,840
 - If you find a caterpillar in South America,

965
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,680
 is it worth giving it a snort just in case?

966
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,400
 - No, I don't think so, because it might be one of the other ones.

967
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,880
 So for instance, the East and Tent Caterpillar,

968
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,120
 they'll deliberately eat parts of the cherry leaves

969
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:15,280
 that contain cyanide and they'll vomit out cyanide.

970
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,120
 - Wow.

971
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,920
 - Okay, so it's not worth risking it

972
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,960
 for the cocaine high in case you get the cyanide poison.

973
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,800
 - Yeah.

974
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,640
 - Yeah, fair enough.

975
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,560
 - You know the very hungry caterpillar at the book.

976
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,720
 I do.

977
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,760
 A copy of that book has been bought every minute

978
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,200
 since it was published in 1969.

979
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,040
 - No.

980
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:31,880
 - Yes.

981
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,720
 - Because shop's closed.

982
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,560
 (all laughing)

983
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,000
 - It's been unabouraged.

984
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,040
 - Yeah, but the world turns then.

985
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:37,880
 - World turns.

986
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,280
 - Shop's open.

987
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,120
 - Oh yeah.

988
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,480
 - Just when the book shops in Japan are opening for the day.

989
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,320
 - That's true.

990
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,760
 - So it's-- - Is everything in Japan?

991
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,600
 - Yeah.

992
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,960
 It's been translated to every, what I'm saying is

993
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,760
 that it sold 30 million copies, all right?

994
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,320
 Otherwise, guys. (all laughing)

995
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,480
 Would you add up all the minutes between 96 and I know.

996
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,360
 - But it could have sold them all yesterday.

997
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,200
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

998
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,040
 - Yeah.

999
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,560
 - But it didn't because I remember reading it as a child.

1000
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,400
 - Yay.

1001
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,760
 - You might have got a free copy.

1002
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,200
 It might have been like a preview copy.

1003
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,040
 - It wasn't like a free copy.

1004
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,400
 - A copy, a proof copy, yeah.

1005
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,240
 - There you go.

1006
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,920
 - But it's been proof copies this whole time.

1007
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,160
 (all laughing)

1008
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,880
 This is the year it's finally published.

1009
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,880
 (all laughing)

1010
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,720
 - How should we do?

1011
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,600
 - No, let's do 30 million copies.

1012
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,960
 (all laughing)

1013
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,080
 - Okay, it's impressive, guys.

1014
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,080
 Anyway, but my point is that the plot

1015
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,760
 of the very hungry cat footage is completely inaccurate.

1016
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,600
 - What?

1017
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,360
 - For one very simple reason.

1018
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,320
 'Cause on the first day, he has an orange on the second day,

1019
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,040
 he has two apples, and I'm getting the fruits a bit wrong.

1020
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,280
 But he eats a lot of stuff over the course of the day.

1021
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,280
 - He eats some cocaine.

1022
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,800
 - He eats some cocaine.

1023
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,040
 - I don't think he read this book.

1024
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,480
 (all laughing)

1025
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,040
 What point is that almost all caterpillars

1026
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,000
 have one specific plant only that they like to feed on.

1027
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,600
 So the very hungry catapilla is an absurd fiction.

1028
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,120
 - It should have just been every page.

1029
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,440
 - He ate an apple, he ate another bit of apple.

1030
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,560
 He ate another bit of the same apple.

1031
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,560
 He ate another bit of the same species of apple.

1032
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,360
 That's what you're recommending for the sequel.

1033
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,360
 - Yeah, I am.

1034
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,840
 (all laughing)

1035
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,240
 - Very hungry and factually accurate catapilla.

1036
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,400
 (all laughing)

1037
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,760
 'Cause you know flies vomit, so you're a fly lands on your food

1038
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,040
 and then it vomits straight away

1039
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:09,080
 because it can't metabolize food internally.

1040
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,400
 So it takes it in and vomits up its enzymes.

1041
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,240
 - It's not true.

1042
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,880
 - Yeah, that's true.

1043
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:17,240
 But one problem that they have is at crime scenes

1044
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,520
 because if there's a lot of blood at crime scenes,

1045
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,120
 then flies would have come along

1046
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,440
 and they eat a lot of the blood

1047
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,440
 and then they vomit on the walls straight away

1048
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,320
 and they create little blood spatters

1049
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,360
 and people who are crime scene specialists

1050
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,720
 have to know to tell the difference

1051
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,440
 and they're looking really close up at blood spatters

1052
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,480
 between blood vomited by flies and blood.

1053
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,320
 - This is amazing.

1054
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,600
 So what you can do is if people check your hands for blood

1055
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,400
 after there's been a crime,

1056
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,440
 you can say, "Oh, just a fly landed on it

1057
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,760
 and vomited on my hands."

1058
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,360
 So I was nowhere near it at the time.

1059
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,960
 - And on my shirt and on this fat.

1060
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,120
 (all laughing)

1061
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,280
 Oh, there's one fly, man and a lie.

1062
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,800
 (all laughing)

1063
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,720
 - And here.

1064
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,520
 - Anyway, here's my witness.

1065
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,920
 (all laughing)

1066
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,800
 - Go on, Derek, tell them how you did it.

1067
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,840
 (all laughing)

1068
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,440
 - Everybody, Dickie, tell me how many, Derek.

1069
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,440
 (all laughing)

1070
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,600
 - And all this cocaine on my hands as well?

1071
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,120
 (all laughing)

1072
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,120
 - Oh, that's Colin.

1073
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,920
 (all laughing)

1074
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,520
 (upbeat music)

1075
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,440
 - Okay, that's it.

1076
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,560
 That is all of our facts.

1077
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,240
