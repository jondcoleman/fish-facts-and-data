00:00:00,00:00:19,"On the other hand, Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly"
00:00:19,00:00:23,podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.
00:00:23,00:00:29,"My name is Dan Schreiber, and I am sitting here with James Harcad, Annotzzytski, and Andrew"
00:00:29,00:00:30,Hunter Murray.
00:00:30,00:00:34,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts"
00:00:34,00:00:39,"from the last seven days, and in a particular order, here we go."
00:00:39,00:00:44,"Starting with my fact, my fact this week is that in America, you get traffic jams caused"
00:00:44,00:00:47,by people chasing tornadoes.
00:00:47,00:00:53,"These are people who actively get in cars when they hear a tornado out there in the fields,"
00:00:53,00:00:58,and they try and track it and chase after it in buses and cars and so on.
00:00:58,00:01:01,"And it used to be a very niche thing, but then TV shows started happening, and more and"
00:01:01,00:01:03,more people got into it.
00:01:03,00:01:04,"They still quite niche, isn't that?"
00:01:04,00:01:09,"Quite niche, but big enough that it's clogging up the roads because thousands of people are"
00:01:09,00:01:10,doing it now.
00:01:10,00:01:11,And the rural roads as well.
00:01:11,00:01:12,Yes.
00:01:12,00:01:15,"It's not like you can get there always, sometimes it's just in the middle of a field that"
00:01:15,00:01:16,tornadoes happening.
00:01:16,00:01:18,"I don't really know much about tornadoes, clearly, but..."
00:01:18,00:01:23,"I think they don't adhere to roads and fields, and boundaries in general."
00:01:23,00:01:25,I think they just go where they want to.
00:01:25,00:01:27,"Yeah, it's true."
00:01:27,00:01:32,"I met recently in America, someone in Shelbyville, who was talking about training to become a storm"
00:01:32,00:01:33,chaser.
00:01:33,00:01:37,"She does it for a living now, and she was going to be one of these people who were going"
00:01:37,00:01:38,to look for them.
00:01:38,00:01:39,And it happened.
00:01:39,00:01:42,Her interest was sparked after her entire house was destroyed.
00:01:42,00:01:43,Wow.
00:01:43,00:01:44,Yes.
00:01:44,00:01:48,So they all have these bunkers in America that they go into for tornado shelter.
00:01:48,00:01:49,And they don't have enough.
00:01:49,00:01:52,They're very angry because the government hasn't done enough about it.
00:01:52,00:01:55,But when you say they all do you mean people in tornado alley?
00:01:55,00:01:56,"Yes, yeah."
00:01:56,00:01:57,"Sorry, what's tornado alley?"
00:01:57,00:02:01,"Oh, it's just the area of America where the vast majority of tornadoes happen."
00:02:01,00:02:04,"So it's Kansas kind of area, isn't it?"
00:02:04,00:02:05,"Okay, I didn't know that."
00:02:05,00:02:06,It's the Wizard of Oz.
00:02:06,00:02:07,The Wizard of Oz.
00:02:07,00:02:08,Yeah.
00:02:08,00:02:09,Indeed.
00:02:09,00:02:13,"But so Twister did a lot, the film Twister did a lot for tornado PR, didn't it?"
00:02:13,00:02:14,Yeah.
00:02:14,00:02:15,"That was the big moment, really."
00:02:15,00:02:19,"I think this is where tornado chases first picked up on the idea, and they did loads"
00:02:19,00:02:24,"of research and they got really involved with the, you know, government weather systems team,"
00:02:24,00:02:27,"whatever they're called, the NOAA, I think."
00:02:27,00:02:30,And they had lots of scientists on board the film and Bill Paxton got really into it.
00:02:30,00:02:31,Right.
00:02:31,00:02:34,"And he did a documentary after it about tornadoes, I think."
00:02:34,00:02:38,But there was a really sweet moment early this year because he died in February.
00:02:38,00:02:39,That's right.
00:02:39,00:02:42,"And there's this thing called the Spotter Network, which is this online network that all"
00:02:42,00:02:44,tornado chases are on.
00:02:44,00:02:50,And so the Spotter Network gives a GPS location for where the phone's owner is.
00:02:50,00:02:55,And so all these tornado chases lined up and spelled out the initials BP up tornado alley.
00:02:55,00:02:56,It was petroleum.
00:02:56,00:02:57,Yeah.
00:02:57,00:02:58,And that was weird.
00:02:58,00:03:00,Because Bill Paxton had shares in British petroleum.
00:03:00,00:03:01,"Well, exactly."
00:03:01,00:03:02,Yeah.
00:03:02,00:03:03,But it was huge.
00:03:03,00:03:06,"So I was looking at, I was looking at the initials and people were tweeting it."
00:03:06,00:03:10,And there are all these little green dots for where all the tornado chases are spelling
00:03:10,00:03:11,out BP.
00:03:11,00:03:12,Yeah.
00:03:12,00:03:14,I looked at Google Maps and it was a massive amount of space they were covering.
00:03:14,00:03:17,So the line of the P was 230 miles high.
00:03:17,00:03:18,Really?
00:03:18,00:03:19,Yeah.
00:03:19,00:03:20,Wow.
00:03:20,00:03:21,I thought it was just in a field or something.
00:03:21,00:03:22,Yeah.
00:03:22,00:03:24,But you don't need cars bumper to bumper for 230 miles.
00:03:24,00:03:25,No.
00:03:25,00:03:26,You can't just have two cars.
00:03:26,00:03:27,I'm just checking.
00:03:27,00:03:28,Yeah.
00:03:28,00:03:32,"What you said about they use GPS, I think that's why this is so popular now, isn't it?"
00:03:32,00:03:37,"Because in the olden days, in order to find a tornado, you'd have to go to the weather forecasters"
00:03:37,00:03:40,"and you'd have to, you know, be quite an expert."
00:03:40,00:03:42,"And these days, you just need an app on a car."
00:03:42,00:03:43,Yeah.
00:03:43,00:03:44,You can just find it.
00:03:44,00:03:45,Yeah.
00:03:45,00:03:46,Because you need to know in advance.
00:03:46,00:03:49,"And we just have, we still have really bad tornado forecasting systems, don't we?"
00:03:49,00:03:52,I think the average amount of time between when you're told that there's a tornado coming
00:03:52,00:03:55,towards you and when you have to be out of your house is 13 minutes.
00:03:55,00:03:56,Yes.
00:03:56,00:03:57,Still so.
00:03:57,00:03:59,So this is the big problem with the storm chases.
00:03:59,00:04:04,"People now, if there is a tornado warning in their area, have to be prepared to leave extra"
00:04:04,00:04:08,"early because just trying to flee their houses, they're going to get caught up in the traffic"
00:04:08,00:04:10,of the people actually heading towards the tornado.
00:04:10,00:04:13,They will be heading the other way.
00:04:13,00:04:16,"They just are, yeah, I guess so, but so it'll be fine."
00:04:16,00:04:17,"Oh, yeah."
00:04:17,00:04:19,I don't know if you need to turn left or right.
00:04:19,00:04:20,"Yeah, exactly."
00:04:20,00:04:21,Some roads are.
00:04:21,00:04:22,Yeah.
00:04:22,00:04:25,Have you ever seen a disaster movie like everyone goes in the same direction?
00:04:25,00:04:28,"And if you go in in the opposite direction, you might get eaten by Godzilla, but at least"
00:04:28,00:04:29,you can get that quickly.
00:04:29,00:04:30,"Yeah, that's true."
00:04:30,00:04:34,"But no, you can't because everyone's going to film Godzilla because the Godzilla app"
00:04:34,00:04:35,they've got on their phone.
00:04:35,00:04:36,Yeah.
00:04:36,00:04:38,To extend as much for too far.
00:04:38,00:04:41,"Speaking of movies, did you say you had a load of trivia before we started?"
00:04:41,00:04:45,"That's the fact about Twister, but Anna read it out just now, so was that it?"
00:04:45,00:04:46,The Bill Paxon thing.
00:04:46,00:04:47,I've got one more.
00:04:47,00:04:48,Coming on.
00:04:48,00:04:50,"In the film Twister, do you know what the noise of the tornado was?"
00:04:50,00:04:55,"Oh, I will give you £1,000 if you guess."
00:04:55,00:04:58,Was it the camel's moan that was slowed down?
00:04:58,00:04:59,Yeah.
00:04:59,00:05:07,"So like back details, please do read them out, because I need them to get that thousand pounds"
00:05:07,00:05:08,back.
00:05:08,00:05:10,"Yes, it was a camel's moan slowed down."
00:05:10,00:05:13,How did they make a camel moan?
00:05:13,00:05:16,That sounds like the start of a joke.
00:05:16,00:05:21,So the other one bit of trivia about Twister is that it was the first Hollywood movie released
00:05:21,00:05:22,on DVD.
00:05:22,00:05:23,Really?
00:05:23,00:05:24,No.
00:05:24,00:05:25,That is a good bit of trivia.
00:05:25,00:05:29,"That's cool, because it would have been the first movie to spin as well in order to play"
00:05:29,00:05:30,it.
00:05:30,00:05:31,"Oh, yeah."
00:05:31,00:05:32,Although the spools of a VHS do spin.
00:05:32,00:05:33,"Oh, damn it."
00:05:33,00:05:34,You're right.
00:05:34,00:05:35,Yes.
00:05:35,00:05:36,Sorry.
00:05:36,00:05:38,"They used to have it in the 1980s, a mobile observatory."
00:05:38,00:05:42,So these days they have armoured cars and armoured trucks and things.
00:05:42,00:05:45,Some of them with radar dishes on the back to measure information when the professionals
00:05:45,00:05:46,do it.
00:05:46,00:05:49,"But in the '80s they had one, which was a massive barrel, and they just had to leave it"
00:05:49,00:05:53,"in the path of a tornado, let it gather all the data that way, right?"
00:05:53,00:05:57,"The really cool thing was it was called the Toronto-Tornado Observatory, or..."
00:05:57,00:05:58,"Oh, Toronto."
00:05:58,00:05:59,Toto.
00:05:59,00:06:00,Toto.
00:06:00,00:06:01,Toto.
00:06:01,00:06:02,After the dog in the Wizard of Oz.
00:06:02,00:06:03,Wow.
00:06:03,00:06:04,How nice is that.
00:06:04,00:06:05,Not the band.
00:06:05,00:06:07,"After the band, Toto."
00:06:07,00:06:12,They have the same one in Africa and they called it that after the band.
00:06:12,00:06:18,"Do you know that one way to judge how much wind speed there is in a tornado used to be, whether"
00:06:18,00:06:22,it would strip all the feathers off a chicken?
00:06:22,00:06:26,As if you would have a chicken near one or you would throw a chicken at it?
00:06:26,00:06:32,"They would fire a chicken out of a gun, like a cannon kind of thing towards the tornado"
00:06:32,00:06:34,to see if it would get stripped.
00:06:34,00:06:35,While it was happening.
00:06:35,00:06:36,"While it was happening, yeah."
00:06:36,00:06:39,"And then you go, ""Oh, these chickens have lost all their feathers, so it must have been"
00:06:39,00:06:41,"more than 341 miles per hour."""
00:06:41,00:06:42,"Oh, OK."
00:06:42,00:06:43,It is that reliable?
00:06:43,00:06:44,It's not reliable.
00:06:44,00:06:45,"No, OK."
00:06:45,00:06:50,And the unreliability of it won a 1997 Ignore Bell Prize.
00:06:50,00:06:55,"And it was worked out by Bernard Vonnegut, who's the brother of Kurt Vonnegut."
00:06:55,00:06:56,"Oh, cool."
00:06:56,00:06:57,And so...
00:06:57,00:06:58,That's awesome.
00:06:58,00:07:01,"What happened was, they always used to use this system, and then he realised that there"
00:07:01,00:07:04,are reasons why it might not work.
00:07:04,00:07:09,Because he said that maybe the explosion from the gun might have got rid of all the feathers.
00:07:09,00:07:14,And the other thing is that sometimes chickens have particularly easy to pluck feathers.
00:07:14,00:07:15,Right.
00:07:15,00:07:16,It's cold and flight malt.
00:07:16,00:07:20,"And every now and then, like once a year or something, you can pluck them quite easily."
00:07:20,00:07:23,"So if you get them at the wrong time, you might miscalculate the speed."
00:07:23,00:07:24,Wow.
00:07:24,00:07:29,"I was reading about a different cannon just yesterday, which was meant to fire humans"
00:07:29,00:07:30,out of.
00:07:30,00:07:31,So it's a human cannonball style cannon.
00:07:31,00:07:39,But the idea was for firefighters and people who needed to get some meetings in other buildings.
00:07:39,00:07:40,Yeah.
00:07:40,00:07:41,I never went through.
00:07:41,00:07:42,I was reading it in a new science book.
00:07:42,00:07:43,I'm just too surprised me.
00:07:43,00:07:44,It never went through.
00:07:44,00:07:45,It was a new scientist book.
00:07:45,00:07:46,And it was using...
00:07:46,00:07:47,So it was an air cannon.
00:07:47,00:07:49,The human was inside.
00:07:49,00:07:53,And the idea would be for firefighters if they needed to get to a top of a building that
00:07:53,00:07:56,"would have taken too long, they would have been shot out of the air cannon to the top"
00:07:56,00:07:57,of the building.
00:07:57,00:08:00,Would it not have been a tube that they went through the tube the whole way?
00:08:00,00:08:02,"The word was cannon, yeah."
00:08:02,00:08:03,So.
00:08:03,00:08:04,That's interesting.
00:08:04,00:08:08,"So cannons as in human cannonballs, they usually springs rather than..."
00:08:08,00:08:10,"So the idea was this was air, propulsion."
00:08:10,00:08:11,I have never thought.
00:08:11,00:08:14,I've never considered what actually is the form of propulsion for a human cannonball.
00:08:14,00:08:15,"Well, now you know."
00:08:15,00:08:16,Now I know.
00:08:16,00:08:17,I did always sort of assume it was gunpowder.
00:08:17,00:08:18,Do you?
00:08:18,00:08:23,But it makes no sense.
00:08:23,00:08:27,Have you guys heard about the proposed Great Wall of Kansas?
00:08:27,00:08:28,No.
00:08:28,00:08:29,No.
00:08:29,00:08:30,This is to stop tornadoes.
00:08:30,00:08:31,How big is it?
00:08:31,00:08:39,"It's a thousand feet high, 150 feet wide, and it would cost 60 billion dollars per 100 miles."
00:08:39,00:08:40,This was proposed.
00:08:40,00:08:41,"A thousand feet high, yeah."
00:08:41,00:08:43,This is sort of the Eiffel Tower all the way along.
00:08:43,00:08:46,"This is a physicist from Pennsylvania, I believe."
00:08:46,00:08:47,He presented this.
00:08:47,00:08:49,"No, an engineer then."
00:08:49,00:08:50,No.
00:08:50,00:08:51,No.
00:08:51,00:08:56,"He said, ""If we build three east-west Great Walls in the American Midwest, this is a three"
00:08:56,00:08:57,"wall."""
00:08:57,00:09:01,"So one in North Dakota, one along the border between Kansas and Oklahoma to the east and the"
00:09:01,00:09:07,"third one in South Texas and Louisiana, we will diminish the tornado threats in tornado"
00:09:07,00:09:08,alley forever.
00:09:08,00:09:13,And he was presenting that research in 2014 to the annual meeting of American Physical
00:09:13,00:09:15,Society in Denver.
00:09:15,00:09:18,"Everyone said it's nonsense, obviously."
00:09:18,00:09:21,But he believes that it's a similar thing with mountain ranges and how they concurred
00:09:21,00:09:22,tornadoes.
00:09:22,00:09:24,That's the idea behind it.
00:09:24,00:09:28,"Let's tell you what, if you're a teenager in America and you're looking for a new career,"
00:09:28,00:09:32,"be a massive wall builder, because it seems like, ""Oh, yeah, yeah."""
00:09:32,00:09:33,It's your idea.
00:09:33,00:09:37,"I think if Donald Trump can't pass a 20-foot high wall, then I think the odds are passing"
00:09:37,00:09:41,a thousand foot high wall.
00:09:41,00:09:44,"Hey, do you want to hear about an eclipse, Tracer?"
00:09:44,00:09:45,Yeah.
00:09:45,00:09:46,Yeah.
00:09:46,00:09:47,Two out of three.
00:09:47,00:09:49,"Yes, please, Andy."
00:09:49,00:09:50,Yes.
00:09:50,00:09:51,Quorum.
00:09:51,00:09:53,"No, there are these people."
00:09:53,00:09:56,So America is about to have a massive eclipse on the 21st of August.
00:09:56,00:09:59,It's going to pass across a huge band of America.
00:09:59,00:10:05,"And I think 88 million Americans live within 200 miles, and a lot of those people are expected"
00:10:05,00:10:07,to move towards this band as it moves.
00:10:07,00:10:08,OK.
00:10:08,00:10:11,"But there are certain people who spend their whole lives, all their life savings, everything"
00:10:11,00:10:13,seeing eclipses around the world.
00:10:13,00:10:18,"And one of them is a guy called Mike Kentrianakis, and he works for the American Astronomical Society,"
00:10:18,00:10:22,"which is good, because before that, he was bankrupting himself, traveling around the"
00:10:22,00:10:23,"world, seeing eclipses."
00:10:23,00:10:27,"One of his marriages, I think it may be his first marriage, broke down partly because his"
00:10:27,00:10:30,wife didn't want him to go to Argentina to see an eclipse.
00:10:30,00:10:32,Would she not let him see his son?
00:10:32,00:10:33,Oh!
00:10:33,00:10:34,"Hey, oh!"
00:10:34,00:10:35,Very good.
00:10:35,00:10:36,That's very good.
00:10:36,00:10:41,"But it's got a heartening end, because now he's got this job, and he gets paid to go to"
00:10:41,00:10:42,all the eclipses.
00:10:42,00:10:43,"Yeah, that's really cool."
00:10:43,00:10:44,Or he was spending all his money doing it.
00:10:44,00:10:45,Yeah.
00:10:45,00:10:46,"His marriage is still over, isn't it?"
00:10:46,00:10:47,Yeah.
00:10:47,00:10:50,"I guess if you're purely driven by money, fine."
00:10:50,00:10:53,"But if there are things more important in life, he's lost his family."
00:10:53,00:10:54,"No, no, no, no, no."
00:10:54,00:10:56,"I mean, he may have found love again, we don't know."
00:10:56,00:11:00,"But he said they had other problems as well, but this was just an indication that she wasn't"
00:11:00,00:11:02,able to support the thing he loves more than any other.
00:11:02,00:11:03,Yeah.
00:11:03,00:11:06,"What a weird, I mean, once you see an eclipse, you've seen them all, haven't you?"
00:11:06,00:11:10,"Apparently, it's an incredible experience, and some people, for the first time they experience"
00:11:10,00:11:12,"it, that's all they ever want to do again."
00:11:12,00:11:13,Yeah.
00:11:13,00:11:14,So do you all remember when we had one in the UK?
00:11:14,00:11:15,Yeah.
00:11:15,00:11:16,It was fine.
00:11:16,00:11:17,"Yeah, it was okay, wasn't it?"
00:11:17,00:11:18,Was it total?
00:11:18,00:11:19,Yes.
00:11:19,00:11:21,I think it was cloudy and bit of London.
00:11:21,00:11:25,"Yeah, and the bit where I was, I was in Sheffield, it wasn't quite total there."
00:11:25,00:11:26,But it was pretty total.
00:11:26,00:11:28,I think you had to go to like the silly islands or something.
00:11:28,00:11:31,"Yeah, I was in Cornwall, where it was total, but it was quite cloudy."
00:11:31,00:11:32,So it was.
00:11:32,00:11:36,"I think we've probably said this quote on the show before, but it's worth saying again."
00:11:36,00:11:42,"It was Ian M. Banks who said that if aliens did ever visit us, it would be to watch an"
00:11:42,00:11:46,"eclipse, a total solar eclipse, because the rarity it must be in the universe of having"
00:11:46,00:11:50,a moon and a sun the exact same size that that could happen.
00:11:50,00:11:51,It's a tourist attraction.
00:11:51,00:11:53,That's why they would come to earth.
00:11:53,00:11:54,It's come for the eclipse.
00:11:54,00:11:55,Stay for the Kardashians.
00:11:55,00:11:56,Yeah.
00:11:56,00:12:05,"Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Andy."
00:12:05,00:12:10,"My fact is, there is a special quarantine centre for chocolate in the English countryside."
00:12:10,00:12:12,"Yeah, this is incredible."
00:12:12,00:12:13,It is.
00:12:13,00:12:14,It's amazing.
00:12:14,00:12:19,It's a place in Reading and it's called the International Coco quarantine centre or the
00:12:19,00:12:27,ICQC and it's got about 400 different varieties of cocoa plants all in massive greenhouses and
00:12:27,00:12:32,scientists observe them every week and they more of them come around every month and they
00:12:32,00:12:37,do special checks on them and basically it's because if you're moving cocoa from one
00:12:37,00:12:41,"country to another, there's a real risk that a disease will move from one country to"
00:12:41,00:12:42,another.
00:12:42,00:12:46,The new blight made it to West Africa where loads of the world's cocoa is grown and it's
00:12:46,00:12:48,a massive plant for their economy.
00:12:48,00:12:52,"That could cause massive hardship, distress and disaster."
00:12:52,00:13:00,So every variety moving around the world spends two years in quarantine at the ICQC in Reading.
00:13:00,00:13:01,Right.
00:13:01,00:13:02,Yeah.
00:13:02,00:13:03,"And it's quite, is it quite new?"
00:13:03,00:13:04,Was it built a few years ago?
00:13:04,00:13:08,"No, it's been going since 1985 but they've got a new home since 2015."
00:13:08,00:13:09,Okay.
00:13:09,00:13:10,"Yeah, yeah."
00:13:10,00:13:16,"Sorry, just so I can wrap my head round this, they're collecting the cocoa plants from around"
00:13:16,00:13:18,the world to sit there to put through quarantine.
00:13:18,00:13:19,It's not chocolate bars.
00:13:19,00:13:20,It's not.
00:13:20,00:13:24,That's why all the chocolate you eat is off now.
00:13:24,00:13:29,"But what I mean is, if a new plant is going to be used or if they're going to use it from"
00:13:29,00:13:35,"mass shipment, they have to then send samples to these guys or you have to send, you send"
00:13:35,00:13:40,"the budwood, which is a little length of branch with a bud sprouting, right?"
00:13:40,00:13:43,"They put it in an insect-proof cage, just in case it's got an insect, which carries disease"
00:13:43,00:13:45,on it for a couple of months.
00:13:45,00:13:49,"Then they grow it, they grow a clone, that's called an indicator of a rifle."
00:13:49,00:13:53,"And then if after two years the plant is completely free of disease, it's allowed to go"
00:13:53,00:13:57,on to the place it was going to go to in the first place.
00:13:57,00:14:00,"So if you ever want to send cocoa from one part of the world to the other, it has to go"
00:14:00,00:14:01,through Reading.
00:14:01,00:14:02,Exactly.
00:14:02,00:14:03,Wow.
00:14:03,00:14:05,"It's like getting a train to Bristol, isn't it?"
00:14:05,00:14:12,"And also looking at photos of this place, it looked a bit like, I assume they keep elements"
00:14:12,00:14:15,"of the cocoa that's been sent to them, they don't just send out the whole thing."
00:14:15,00:14:23,"It looks like it's a, the life raft of endangered cocoa plants, it's the one true spot that we"
00:14:23,00:14:24,know we're preserving them.
00:14:24,00:14:25,Yeah.
00:14:25,00:14:28,"It makes it, nothing makes me feel patriotic usually, but reading about this, I thought,"
00:14:28,00:14:31,"wow, we are so special."
00:14:31,00:14:33,We in Britain are saving the world's chocolate.
00:14:33,00:14:34,That's a big deal.
00:14:34,00:14:35,It's really impressive.
00:14:35,00:14:37,"And the world's chocolate is kind of under threat, isn't it?"
00:14:37,00:14:43,So the demand is massively exceeding supply at the moment and we're running out of cocoa
00:14:43,00:14:44,plants.
00:14:44,00:14:45,They're really hard to farm.
00:14:45,00:14:51,"So I think only 30% of them, if you have a cocoa farm, only 30% of your plants will actually"
00:14:51,00:14:54,"flower and create the cocoa, because there are so many pests."
00:14:54,00:14:55,Yeah.
00:14:55,00:14:59,"They've got these diseases with really cool names, like frosty pod and witch's broom."
00:14:59,00:15:04,"So there's a list on Wikipedia of all these diseases, and a lot of them have the"
00:15:04,00:15:07,"word ""pod"" at the end, like frosty pod."
00:15:07,00:15:09,And so do a lot of podcasts.
00:15:09,00:15:16,So I wonder if you can tell me whether these cocoa disease or podcasts.
00:15:16,00:15:23,"So frosty pod, you said, black pod, oh, I disease, podcast."
00:15:23,00:15:24,Disease.
00:15:24,00:15:29,"It's a disease, ghost pod."
00:15:29,00:15:30,Podcast.
00:15:30,00:15:39,"Does it be either, it really does disease, it's a podcast, two for two, chicken pop pod."
00:15:39,00:15:40,Disease.
00:15:40,00:15:41,Disease.
00:15:41,00:15:42,Podcast.
00:15:42,00:15:43,What?
00:15:43,00:15:45,So comedy podcast.
00:15:45,00:15:46,Mealy pod.
00:15:46,00:15:47,Disease.
00:15:47,00:15:48,Disease.
00:15:48,00:15:49,Disease.
00:15:49,00:15:50,A podcast.
00:15:50,00:15:51,It's a disease.
00:15:51,00:15:55,"And I got a million more of those, but that was the end of the game."
00:15:55,00:15:57,They're just the four that were sponsored by this week.
00:15:57,00:15:59,"Oh, that was a very exciting game."
00:15:59,00:16:00,I had a game before.
00:16:00,00:16:02,I just have a game every time.
00:16:02,00:16:03,"Yeah, that's great."
00:16:03,00:16:07,"So this place was, this is how important this is to the chocolate industry."
00:16:07,00:16:12,It was funded mutually by a large group of the biggest chocolate makers in the world
00:16:12,00:16:17,"from Cadbury through to Mars, through to Willy Wonka, through to, no, he doesn't exist."
00:16:17,00:16:18,That was a game.
00:16:18,00:16:19,"Well, there is Willy Wonka."
00:16:19,00:16:20,"Candy, they bought."
00:16:20,00:16:21,There's a brand.
00:16:21,00:16:22,Yeah.
00:16:22,00:16:23,"Oh, then it could be."
00:16:23,00:16:25,"Well, then very, very well, maybe an investor in this place."
00:16:25,00:16:29,"Anna, does this still make you feel really patriotic that our country is doing this?"
00:16:29,00:16:31,"Well, actually, it's just a load of multi-nationers."
00:16:31,00:16:36,"It's gradually seeping away my nascent nationalism, sure."
00:16:36,00:16:41,"Just quickly, do you know why this cocoa chocolate quarantine centre is in Reading?"
00:16:41,00:16:42,"Oh, no."
00:16:42,00:16:47,"Well, Reading was their football team's called The Biscuit Men, so there's a biscuit company"
00:16:47,00:16:48,there.
00:16:48,00:16:49,Exactly.
00:16:49,00:16:50,It's for the chocolate biscuit.
00:16:50,00:16:51,"No, sadly, it's not that."
00:16:51,00:16:57,It's because it's so cold in Britain and particularly Reading that none of the diseases
00:16:57,00:17:02,which they're potentially harboring in the centre could survive outside in the wilds
00:17:02,00:17:03,of the countryside around Reading.
00:17:03,00:17:04,"It's that, yeah."
00:17:04,00:17:08,"Yeah, so well, that's why it's in Britain, basically, Reading is an afterthought."
00:17:08,00:17:12,"So, this is really common with other crops as well, isn't it?"
00:17:12,00:17:15,There are various other things that get quarantined in countries that are the opposite of where
00:17:15,00:17:16,they came from.
00:17:16,00:17:18,"It's like going on a gap, yeah."
00:17:18,00:17:21,You go somewhere as different as you can to your home country.
00:17:21,00:17:26,"So, I think bananas, most bananas spend some time in Belgium in transit."
00:17:26,00:17:30,Coffee goes to Portugal and spend some time being in Portugal.
00:17:30,00:17:35,"And yeah, it has to be places where the usual pests of those crops won't survive in that"
00:17:35,00:17:36,climate.
00:17:36,00:17:37,"Portugal, though, as well."
00:17:37,00:17:38,"It's quite warm, isn't it?"
00:17:38,00:17:39,Is it?
00:17:39,00:17:40,Yeah.
00:17:40,00:17:41,"Because, simply, it's come from, like, Brazil or somewhere."
00:17:41,00:17:42,"Not the opposite of Brazil, is it?"
00:17:42,00:17:43,It's not.
00:17:43,00:17:44,It's very much not.
00:17:44,00:17:45,It's not the exact opposite.
00:17:45,00:17:46,You're right.
00:17:46,00:17:49,But I use the colonial oppressor of Brazil of anything.
00:17:49,00:17:51,Are you sending every banana there?
00:17:51,00:17:52,No!
00:17:52,00:17:53,No!
00:17:53,00:17:54,No!
00:17:54,00:17:55,No!
00:17:55,00:18:00,Not every chocolate bar goes to redding.
00:18:00,00:18:06,You can just listen back to Andy's explanation at the start when you hear this.
00:18:06,00:18:12,"Do you know what the most expensive chocolate ever sold for is, and this is in terms of-"
00:18:12,00:18:13,Okay.
00:18:13,00:18:15,Do you want the price or what's in the chocolate or-
00:18:15,00:18:17,Maybe price and what the chocolate was.
00:18:17,00:18:18,Was it a-
00:18:18,00:18:19,Okay.
00:18:19,00:18:22,"I'll say a million pounds, and it was a bar of flexed with gold."
00:18:22,00:18:23,Yeah.
00:18:23,00:18:27,This is a hard one because I think there probably are more expensive chocolates on the market.
00:18:27,00:18:30,So this was sold at Christie's Auction House.
00:18:30,00:18:31,Okay.
00:18:31,00:18:32,Okay.
00:18:32,00:18:34,So it was a historical piece of chocolate.
00:18:34,00:18:35,Yes.
00:18:35,00:18:37,It was something that Mallory took up ever.
00:18:37,00:18:38,Very close.
00:18:38,00:18:41,You're totally in the territory in that it's exploration.
00:18:41,00:18:42,Is it Chacolton took to the south?
00:18:42,00:18:43,So close.
00:18:43,00:18:44,It's exactly in the-
00:18:44,00:18:45,Yes.
00:18:45,00:18:46,Scott.
00:18:46,00:18:48,It's like a diddle the hardware.
00:18:48,00:18:55,"Scott's first expedition to the Antarctic in the early 1900s, and how much did his bar?"
00:18:55,00:18:57,It's one little lump of chocolates.
00:18:57,00:18:59,Was it made of gold as well?
00:18:59,00:19:00,No.
00:19:00,00:19:01,"No, it was just made of chocolate."
00:19:01,00:19:02,Yeah.
00:19:02,00:19:03,"20,000 pounds."
00:19:03,00:19:04,No.
00:19:04,00:19:08,"I'll go for a bar of chocolate, £7,984."
00:19:08,00:19:09,Okay.
00:19:09,00:19:13,"I think, actually, less than, I think £4,500."
00:19:13,00:19:14,£470.
00:19:14,00:19:15,"Oh, okay."
00:19:15,00:19:16,Yeah.
00:19:16,00:19:18,I've never shot it.
00:19:18,00:19:19,"20,000 was way off, wasn't it?"
00:19:19,00:19:20,Yeah.
00:19:20,00:19:24,"But I would have thought 20,000 was more in the ballpark of something that is attached to an extraordinarily"
00:19:24,00:19:27,historically important trip.
00:19:27,00:19:31,"The thing is, I bet they did an auction with lots of different things from his expedition."
00:19:31,00:19:32,They did.
00:19:32,00:19:34,And this was probably the shittiest one of the lots.
00:19:34,00:19:35,Yes.
00:19:35,00:19:37,"His diaries went and they went for £600, so-"
00:19:37,00:19:38,£600?
00:19:38,00:19:40,"No, of course not."
00:19:40,00:19:43,"No, they were like £90,000, £200,000, something like that."
00:19:43,00:19:45,So this is for the one person who couldn't get anything else in the light.
00:19:45,00:19:46,I'll just get the chocolate.
00:19:46,00:19:47,"Yeah, just, yeah."
00:19:47,00:19:48,I'll bring the chocolate out.
00:19:48,00:19:52,With something to eat on the way out.
00:19:52,00:19:53,Yeah.
00:19:53,00:19:54,Exactly.
00:19:54,00:20:00,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Chisinski."
00:20:00,00:20:06,"Yep, my fact is that, to celebrate the Communist Revolution, the Bolsheviks plan to build a tower"
00:20:06,00:20:11,in St. Petersburg that projected the news onto the clouds.
00:20:11,00:20:12,Oh.
00:20:12,00:20:15,"And this was this really cool idea, it was part of, so as soon as the Bolshevik Revolution"
00:20:15,00:20:19,"happened, Lenin launched this thing called the monumental propaganda campaign."
00:20:19,00:20:23,"And the idea was to build all these monuments, it's quite a clever pun when it's translated"
00:20:23,00:20:24,into English.
00:20:24,00:20:29,"But the idea was to build all these monuments, which were a big piece of Soviet propaganda."
00:20:29,00:20:34,"And this guy was commissioned, this architect called Tatlin, Vladimir Tatlin, was commissioned"
00:20:34,00:20:39,to design something that was going to be called the Monument to the Third International.
00:20:39,00:20:44,"And so in 1919 he designed this insane building, which is, it's often called the most influential"
00:20:44,00:20:46,building that was never built.
00:20:46,00:20:47,Wow.
00:20:47,00:20:51,"Because it's inspired lots of artists and designers ever since, and it's just really fascinating."
00:20:51,00:20:56,"And it was going to be 400 meters tall, it was going to be made of steel and glass and"
00:20:56,00:20:57,iron.
00:20:57,00:21:00,"It was this double helix structure, so it looks like a spiral on the way up."
00:21:00,00:21:04,"And it had these amazing features, so various bits of it rotated."
00:21:04,00:21:08,These huge glass cubes were then it rotated at different speeds.
00:21:08,00:21:14,"And there was a plan on the top bit to have this information center, which would issue"
00:21:14,00:21:20,"news bulletins that in the night time, or on a cloudy day, shot up into the sky and broadcast"
00:21:20,00:21:24,"in light the news announcements or propaganda onto the sky, onto the clouds."
00:21:24,00:21:25,It's very cool.
00:21:25,00:21:26,It's very cool.
00:21:26,00:21:31,"I think people might be familiar with this tower, because it's quite a famous iconic thing."
00:21:31,00:21:36,"They had a replica of it in the Royal Academy last year or the year before, I think."
00:21:36,00:21:37,I don't know.
00:21:37,00:21:40,And it looks a little bit like the tower at the Olympic Park.
00:21:40,00:21:41,It does.
00:21:41,00:21:42,That's exactly what I was thinking.
00:21:42,00:21:47,"And often if you see any kind of old pictures of Soviet Russia from the 1920s, this is"
00:21:47,00:21:49,"kind of an iconic image, right?"
00:21:49,00:21:50,Yeah.
00:21:50,00:21:52,And they used it and it kind of represented their ambition.
00:21:52,00:21:56,So it was used as a Soviet icon in the '50s and '60s to show how great they were.
00:21:56,00:22:01,"Wait, so this building wasn't built, but all the plans and the drawings were released."
00:22:01,00:22:02,Yes.
00:22:02,00:22:05,We've then sort of subtly built it without...
00:22:05,00:22:06,They've built it.
00:22:06,00:22:08,"At the time even, they built a lot of smaller versions of it."
00:22:08,00:22:09,Okay.
00:22:09,00:22:13,"So it was so massive that there's no, it was impossible to build basically."
00:22:13,00:22:17,"They wouldn't be able to get enough iron, they wouldn't be able to get enough steel."
00:22:17,00:22:21,"And for something, yeah, that was supposed to be like a building, something which has a real"
00:22:21,00:22:24,"social purpose, but the fact is that it was impossible for them to make any work."
00:22:24,00:22:25,Yeah.
00:22:25,00:22:27,"Pretty ironic, guys."
00:22:27,00:22:31,Considering what happened with the communism.
00:22:31,00:22:32,Yeah.
00:22:32,00:22:33,Good.
00:22:33,00:22:34,Right.
00:22:34,00:22:35,Communist anti-communist asylum.
00:22:35,00:22:36,Nice idea.
00:22:36,00:22:37,But...
00:22:37,00:22:38,Doesn't work in practice.
00:22:38,00:22:39,Right.
00:22:39,00:22:40,"Yeah, it doesn't work in practice."
00:22:40,00:22:41,It doesn't get off the ground.
00:22:41,00:22:43,"No, the thing is, Anna, has never been properly tried."
00:22:43,00:22:44,That's the problem.
00:22:44,00:22:45,It's just tried in the wrong place.
00:22:45,00:22:46,It was the wrong environment.
00:22:46,00:22:47,It was the wrong environment.
00:22:47,00:22:48,It was the wrong environment.
00:22:48,00:22:49,It was the wrong environment.
00:22:49,00:22:50,It was the wrong environment.
00:22:50,00:22:51,It was the wrong environment.
00:22:51,00:22:52,It was the wrong environment.
00:22:52,00:22:53,It was the wrong environment.
00:22:53,00:22:54,It was the wrong environment.
00:22:54,00:22:55,It was the wrong environment.
00:22:55,00:22:56,It was the wrong environment.
00:22:56,00:22:57,It was the wrong environment.
00:22:57,00:22:58,It was the wrong environment.
00:22:58,00:22:59,It was the wrong environment.
00:22:59,00:23:00,It was the wrong environment.
00:23:00,00:23:01,It was the wrong environment.
00:23:01,00:23:02,Yeah.
00:23:02,00:23:03,It was the wrong environment.
00:23:03,00:23:04,It was the wrong environment.
00:23:04,00:23:05,It was the wrong environment.
00:23:05,00:23:07,building or was the whole of the building revolving?
00:23:07,00:23:09,- So there were different layers of the building
00:23:09,00:23:11,and it would revolve at different rates.
00:23:11,00:23:12,So one of them would revolve once a day
00:23:12,00:23:14,and another one would be once a week
00:23:14,00:23:15,and another one would be once a month.
00:23:15,00:23:17,"And then the bottom one would be,"
00:23:17,00:23:19,"I think the bottom one would be once a year,"
00:23:19,00:23:20,it would revolve. - Wow.
00:23:20,00:23:23,- And so you'd be able to tell what date and time it was by.
00:23:23,00:23:25,- It was a giant calendar. - It made a plot.
00:23:25,00:23:27,- And it was in a double helix as well.
00:23:27,00:23:29,"Even though the structure of DNA hadn't been,"
00:23:29,00:23:31,"I think, discovered at this time,"
00:23:31,00:23:34,the whole around the cylinder and the cube
00:23:34,00:23:36,and the pyramid and everything that was this huge double helix.
00:23:36,00:23:38,"- Yeah, there's this one guy who's written"
00:23:38,00:23:40,a big kind of biography of this building
00:23:40,00:23:42,who says that it was never intended to be built.
00:23:42,00:23:45,So some people think that it was just a thing
00:23:45,00:23:46,"that was meant to represent, I don't know,"
00:23:46,00:23:50,the ambition or the symbolism of the new Soviet Russia
00:23:50,00:23:51,"that it wasn't meant to be built, but we don't know."
00:23:51,00:23:54,"- The news in the clouds is that a,"
00:23:54,00:23:56,"was scientifically, is that a practical thing?"
00:23:56,00:23:58,I'm purely thinking it is out of the fact
00:23:58,00:24:00,that the Batman logo can be put into the sky.
00:24:00,00:24:02,- I know that is a good documentary.
00:24:02,00:24:05,"- Yeah, and with sequels, but I don't think it was."
00:24:05,00:24:06,So this is the thing I had no idea
00:24:06,00:24:08,that they weren't trying experimenting
00:24:08,00:24:10,"with these wildly technologically advanced ideas,"
00:24:10,00:24:12,but I don't think that was practical.
00:24:12,00:24:14,"- It is practical. - At the time, now."
00:24:14,00:24:16,- Yeah. - Because there was a guy
00:24:16,00:24:18,in Nottingham called Dave Lynch
00:24:18,00:24:22,and he fired a ghost rider onto the clouds
00:24:22,00:24:23,in Nottingham a few years ago.
00:24:23,00:24:24,- Okay. - A ghost rider.
00:24:24,00:24:28,"- Yeah, so it's like a ghostly horse rider guy."
00:24:28,00:24:30,"- Oh, cool. - And it was a bit like my bridges,"
00:24:30,00:24:34,"if you know that old, one of the first animations"
00:24:34,00:24:36,"of the like a galloping horse. - Yeah, yeah."
00:24:36,00:24:37,- It literally was that.
00:24:37,00:24:40,"- It used exactly the same projector as my bridge, didn't it?"
00:24:40,00:24:42,But it used a laser instead of light.
00:24:42,00:24:43,- But there's quite a long way to go
00:24:43,00:24:46,until we can watch Liar Liar on a cloud.
00:24:46,00:24:47,"- Is it? - Yeah, right."
00:24:47,00:24:48,"- Because it's done with the laser,"
00:24:48,00:24:50,so it's all in the green light of the laser.
00:24:50,00:24:53,- But what they were originally doing was the news.
00:24:53,00:24:54,So maybe it would be less difficult
00:24:54,00:24:57,to put like Kay Berlion than Liar Liar
00:24:57,00:24:59,because she's only in one studio.
00:24:59,00:25:00,- That's true. - Mm-hmm.
00:25:00,00:25:01,- Did I miss a reference?
00:25:01,00:25:04,Why are we using a Jim Carey movie from--
00:25:04,00:25:05,- It's just a wrap.
00:25:05,00:25:07,"- Sorry, I just tried to think of a really good film."
00:25:07,00:25:08,- Yeah.
00:25:08,00:25:09,"- You came over my head. - Okay, cool."
00:25:09,00:25:11,"Sorry, I thought I missed a reference"
00:25:11,00:25:12,for that was just absolutely did not.
00:25:12,00:25:13,- Okay.
00:25:13,00:25:14,- That was just crowbarring in a movie.
00:25:14,00:25:15,- You're choice a movie to play
00:25:15,00:25:17,into the clouds with Liar Liar.
00:25:17,00:25:18,- So it's just been half the book.
00:25:18,00:25:20,I was talking about twist already.
00:25:20,00:25:22,- What would you put into the clouds?
00:25:22,00:25:26,"- I just, well, a latest movie, the new Spider-Man,"
00:25:26,00:25:28,or a Game of Thrones episode.
00:25:28,00:25:29,- But here's the thing about that.
00:25:29,00:25:31,"If you put the latest Spider-Man in,"
00:25:31,00:25:32,then no one's gonna go to the cinema
00:25:32,00:25:34,"'cause they can just watch it in the clouds, right?"
00:25:34,00:25:35,"But if you put Liar Liar on,"
00:25:35,00:25:37,which is probably on terrestrial TV
00:25:37,00:25:39,"pretty much once a year or something,"
00:25:39,00:25:41,"then it's fine, you don't lose any money."
00:25:41,00:25:42,"- I want a day, I want a day in my flat."
00:25:42,00:25:43,- So yeah.
00:25:43,00:25:44,(laughing)
00:25:44,00:25:46,"And also down, when people listen to this podcast"
00:25:46,00:25:47,"did a few months, they'll go,"
00:25:47,00:25:49,"""New Spider-Man, what's that?"""
00:25:49,00:25:50,- Yeah.
00:25:50,00:25:50,- Whereas Liar Liar is one of the--
00:25:50,00:25:51,- It's timeless.
00:25:51,00:25:53,"- Well, yeah, that's a movie there."
00:25:53,00:25:55,Induros.
00:25:55,00:25:56,You were talking about the bat signal.
00:25:56,00:25:57,"- Yes, I was, yeah."
00:25:57,00:26:02,- Do you know how they summon Batman on a cloudless night?
00:26:02,00:26:03,- So they project it onto the moon?
00:26:03,00:26:04,- They project it.
00:26:04,00:26:05,- Or a star.
00:26:05,00:26:07,- They project it onto a star.
00:26:07,00:26:08,- Do they just call them?
00:26:08,00:26:10,Does he just probably go on a phone?
00:26:10,00:26:11,"- Well, there is the bat phone, is there?"
00:26:11,00:26:13,"- No, it's none of these things."
00:26:13,00:26:14,"Supposedly, I mean, this is, it's all made up."
00:26:14,00:26:15,- Side of a building.
00:26:15,00:26:16,- Side of a building.
00:26:16,00:26:17,- Is it?
00:26:17,00:26:18,- Yes.
00:26:18,00:26:19,- How come we've never seen that?
00:26:19,00:26:21,Is it just very bad weather in Gotham City most of the time?
00:26:21,00:26:23,"- Yeah, I think so."
00:26:23,00:26:25,"And someone, but someone incredibly geeky"
00:26:25,00:26:28,"on Quora pointed out, actually, 'cause Gotham is near water,"
00:26:28,00:26:29,"it's liable to have more cloud,"
00:26:29,00:26:32,"'cause they'll be, you know, water rising."
00:26:32,00:26:33,"I don't know how true that it's weather-wise, but."
00:26:33,00:26:34,- Also smart.
00:26:34,00:26:35,- Yeah.
00:26:35,00:26:37,"- Probably for them, it's quite good to have bad pollution."
00:26:37,00:26:38,- Yes.
00:26:38,00:26:40,- Is it quite polluted Gotham City?
00:26:40,00:26:41,"- Yeah, it's not."
00:26:41,00:26:42,"- The Batmobile is diesel, I think, isn't it?"
00:26:42,00:26:43,So that's what it is.
00:26:43,00:26:46,(all laughing)
00:26:46,00:26:48,"- It was so embarrassing that time,"
00:26:48,00:26:49,you accidentally filled it up with odd weather.
00:26:49,00:26:52,(all laughing)
00:26:52,00:26:54,- That was Robin that did that.
00:26:54,00:26:56,- That's why he's never allowed to take it out anymore.
00:26:56,00:26:58,(all laughing)
00:26:58,00:27:01,- So the tallest building ever envisioned
00:27:01,00:27:05,"was the X-seed 4000, and it was gonna be in Tokyo,"
00:27:05,00:27:08,"and it was gonna be four kilometers high,"
00:27:08,00:27:11,"pretty much in the shape of Mt. Fuji,"
00:27:11,00:27:13,and it would be able to accommodate
00:27:13,00:27:15,between half a million and one million people.
00:27:15,00:27:17,- Wow. - Wow.
00:27:17,00:27:19,"- And they did the kind of plans for this,"
00:27:19,00:27:21,but never built it.
00:27:21,00:27:23,- Why not unrealistic again?
00:27:23,00:27:26,"- Well, according to the managing director"
00:27:26,00:27:29,"of buildings and data, George Binder,"
00:27:29,00:27:31,he says that they never really meant to build it.
00:27:31,00:27:34,The purpose was to earn some recognition for the firm.
00:27:34,00:27:36,"- Yeah, all these people claiming."
00:27:36,00:27:37,"- No, we never really meant to build it."
00:27:37,00:27:38,- They're always saying this.
00:27:38,00:27:40,- And they reckon it would have cost
00:27:40,00:27:45,minimum of about $500 billion US dollars to make it.
00:27:45,00:27:49,"But from the other fact, I saw that we eat"
00:27:49,00:27:52,"about $100 billion a year on chocolate,"
00:27:52,00:27:54,so we'd only have to give up chocolate as a world
00:27:54,00:27:56,"for five years, and we'd be able to build this tower."
00:27:56,00:27:57,- Cool.
00:27:57,00:28:00,"- I don't, no, that's not what I thought at all."
00:28:00,00:28:01,- Why not?
00:28:01,00:28:02,- I think the vast majority of people in the world
00:28:02,00:28:03,would vote to keep chocolate
00:28:03,00:28:05,and not have a random tower build somewhere in Japan.
00:28:05,00:28:08,"- No, but we would be saving chocolate potentially."
00:28:08,00:28:10,We would replenish the stock.
00:28:10,00:28:13,We would perhaps allow for the leaves to breathe a bit.
00:28:13,00:28:15,"- Not for the odds of it, you get a lot less chocolate grown"
00:28:15,00:28:16,if everyone stops eating it.
00:28:16,00:28:18,"So actually, the stocks would crash then."
00:28:18,00:28:18,- Yeah.
00:28:18,00:28:20,There was another Soviet building
00:28:20,00:28:23,that was supposed to be built was the thing
00:28:23,00:28:25,that was going to replace the 19th Central Cathedral
00:28:25,00:28:27,"of Christ the Saviour, which was like Sonicless,"
00:28:27,00:28:31,"the first huge landmark in St Petersburg,"
00:28:31,00:28:33,what became Petrograd and then Leningrad.
00:28:33,00:28:37,And so the plan was to build this amazing skyscraper
00:28:37,00:28:39,"that was going to be, it looked like a huge wedding cake,"
00:28:39,00:28:42,and on top of it was going to have an 80 meter high statue
00:28:42,00:28:45,"of Lenin, and in his head was going to be a library,"
00:28:45,00:28:47,a Soviet library.
00:28:47,00:28:49,"And it was, again, it was kind of a ridiculous plan,"
00:28:49,00:28:51,but they flattened the Zara's Cathedral.
00:28:51,00:28:52,"So they said, ""We'll get ready for that."""
00:28:52,00:28:55,"And then the USSR ran out of money,"
00:28:55,00:28:56,so that just remained flat.
00:28:56,00:28:59,And all it became was the world's largest open-air swimming pool.
00:28:59,00:29:00,- Oh.
00:29:00,00:29:02,- Which is kind of cooler than a giant Lenin head.
00:29:02,00:29:04,"- The designs were amazing for,"
00:29:04,00:29:06,I remember seeing the designs for that building.
00:29:06,00:29:07,- For Lenin head building.
00:29:07,00:29:09,"- Yeah, would the Lenin head building"
00:29:09,00:29:11,have had a massive swimming pool where his bladder would have been?
00:29:11,00:29:13,(laughing)
00:29:13,00:29:14,"- That's not re-appealing, is it?"
00:29:14,00:29:15,Because of the associations.
00:29:15,00:29:16,- Why not?
00:29:16,00:29:17,"- Don't know, it'd be fun."
00:29:17,00:29:19,- A patriotic Soviet bladder.
00:29:19,00:29:20,- I guess.
00:29:20,00:29:22,- Probably encourage you to be in it.
00:29:22,00:29:23,- It would.
00:29:23,00:29:25,The associations of the word bladder.
00:29:25,00:29:25,- That's true.
00:29:25,00:29:27,- And you can have a watershoot coming out.
00:29:27,00:29:28,- Moving out.
00:29:28,00:29:29,- Your re-trap.
00:29:29,00:29:31,(laughing)
00:29:31,00:29:32,- So great.
00:29:32,00:29:33,- I like this plan more and more.
00:29:33,00:29:36,"The more I think about it, properly."
00:29:36,00:29:37,"- But if you've got a watershoot coming out,"
00:29:37,00:29:39,the bladder's behind that.
00:29:39,00:29:41,"So when you come out of the end of the re-trap,"
00:29:41,00:29:43,"you just fly into midair, right?"
00:29:43,00:29:45,"- Yeah, you just launch back into the city."
00:29:45,00:29:46,- You launch it.
00:29:46,00:29:46,- You're not uncomfortable.
00:29:46,00:29:48,- And you're designed for all these cannons
00:29:48,00:29:51,that fire fighters up to the top of buildings.
00:29:51,00:29:53,"- I don't think we should give up on it,"
00:29:53,00:29:54,but let's park it.
00:29:54,00:29:55,(laughing)
00:29:55,00:29:56,- Let's park it for now.
00:29:56,00:29:59,(upbeat music)
00:29:59,00:30:04,"- Okay, it is time for a final fact"
00:30:04,00:30:07,"to the show, and that is James."
00:30:07,00:30:09,"- Okay, my fact this week is that caterpillars"
00:30:09,00:30:12,are more likely to vomit when they're on their own.
00:30:12,00:30:13,- Right.
00:30:13,00:30:16,"- We all throw up when we're lonely, come on."
00:30:16,00:30:18,"- Well, is that why they do it?"
00:30:18,00:30:19,"- Then I don't know if they're lonely,"
00:30:19,00:30:22,"but the reason that they vomit is to get rid of predators,"
00:30:22,00:30:25,because predators don't like being vomited on.
00:30:25,00:30:27,"And when they're in a group,"
00:30:27,00:30:30,they don't need to do it because they're in a group.
00:30:30,00:30:33,And actually one of their mates can vomit instead.
00:30:33,00:30:36,"And so what happens is if you vomit,"
00:30:36,00:30:39,it's bad for you 'cause you get rid of your nutrition
00:30:39,00:30:41,and you need that food.
00:30:41,00:30:43,"But if you're in a group and someone else vomits,"
00:30:43,00:30:44,then it gets rid of the predator
00:30:44,00:30:46,and you've still got all of your food inside you.
00:30:46,00:30:49,And so a study was done in 2012
00:30:49,00:30:51,that found that this caterpillar
00:30:51,00:30:53,"of the large white butterfly,"
00:30:53,00:30:55,they are more likely when they're in a group
00:30:55,00:30:57,to try and cheat and let someone else do the vomiting.
00:30:57,00:30:58,"- Oh, wow."
00:30:58,00:30:59,- But what if they all think that?
00:30:59,00:31:03,"This is typical selfish, individualistic 21st century society."
00:31:03,00:31:07,"If you all think someone else will pick up that rubbish,"
00:31:07,00:31:07,then no one's gonna do it.
00:31:07,00:31:09,- That's why caterpillars need to go back
00:31:09,00:31:11,to a Soviet sister.
00:31:11,00:31:12,"- Yeah, I think that last fact"
00:31:12,00:31:14,"really infected you a bit, isn't it?"
00:31:14,00:31:17,- It's amazing how they're all waiting for the other guy
00:31:17,00:31:18,to get the round in basically.
00:31:18,00:31:19,- Yeah.
00:31:19,00:31:20,- I'm just really sorry.
00:31:20,00:31:22,I've just been working out the caterpillar.
00:31:22,00:31:25,"It is very almost an unagram of capitalist, isn't it?"
00:31:25,00:31:26,So it's no wonder they brought down
00:31:26,00:31:30,the Soviet system with their self-serving ways.
00:31:30,00:31:32,"There's, did you see the caterpillar they found?"
00:31:32,00:31:34,"I think last year or the year before,"
00:31:34,00:31:39,it was in Peru and it's from the Nomata Campo genus.
00:31:39,00:31:41,It was in the Amazon.
00:31:41,00:31:43,And it responds if you shouted it.
00:31:43,00:31:44,It doesn't like being shouted at.
00:31:44,00:31:47,And it's got these tentacles on its back.
00:31:47,00:31:48,And there's a film of it.
00:31:48,00:31:50,"And if you just yell at the caterpillar like that,"
00:31:50,00:31:53,then it's tentacles just flick out straight away.
00:31:53,00:31:54,"So it's like, you know, when you're talking to a microphone"
00:31:54,00:31:56,"and you watch the sound waves go up and down as you do,"
00:31:56,00:31:57,it's like that.
00:31:57,00:31:59,"As soon as you yell at it,"
00:31:59,00:32:01,it fires out these long tentacles from its back.
00:32:01,00:32:04,- But is it scarier or is it attacking you?
00:32:04,00:32:05,- We have no idea why it does that.
00:32:05,00:32:09,"- Because you use it as a way of measuring sound, couldn't you?"
00:32:09,00:32:10,- You absolutely could.
00:32:10,00:32:13,- You could use it like as a clapometer or something.
00:32:13,00:32:13,- Yes.
00:32:13,00:32:15,"- If you want to know who's the most popular,"
00:32:15,00:32:17,you get them to applaud and then you have loads
00:32:17,00:32:18,of these little caterpillars.
00:32:18,00:32:20,"And the longer their tentacles go out, the more popular you are."
00:32:20,00:32:21,- Wow.
00:32:21,00:32:22,- That would be so cool.
00:32:22,00:32:24,"Until the RSPCA got onto you,"
00:32:24,00:32:27,that would be unbelievably cool to have a mass of caterpillars.
00:32:27,00:32:29,"- But you could do it on like Britain's Got Talent,"
00:32:29,00:32:30,"instead of having the judges,"
00:32:30,00:32:32,just have audience reactions.
00:32:32,00:32:33,- Yeah.
00:32:33,00:32:34,"- Well, in the chairs, they're all caterpillars."
00:32:34,00:32:35,- Yeah.
00:32:35,00:32:37,"- I do like that, actually."
00:32:37,00:32:38,I would watch.
00:32:38,00:32:41,"- And the longer the tentacle, the more they like it."
00:32:41,00:32:42,- Yeah.
00:32:42,00:32:42,- You measure the tentacles.
00:32:42,00:32:44,- But we don't yet know if they like it or not.
00:32:44,00:32:46,So the worst acts might get through.
00:32:46,00:32:48,"- Yeah, it's actually just the loudest acts."
00:32:48,00:32:51,"- Yeah, but it's not the loudest audience response."
00:32:51,00:32:53,"- Yeah, sorry, sorry."
00:32:53,00:32:54,So they're not in the judges seat.
00:32:54,00:32:55,"Sorry, they're the audience."
00:32:55,00:32:57,- It's much more democratic than Britain's Got Talent.
00:32:57,00:32:58,"- No, they are in the judges seats."
00:32:58,00:32:59,"The caterpillars aren't the audience,"
00:32:59,00:33:02,because you need an audience to make the noise.
00:33:02,00:33:03,- So sorry.
00:33:03,00:33:04,"- Yeah, but booze are noises as well."
00:33:04,00:33:05,"- Oh, yeah."
00:33:05,00:33:06,- Yeah.
00:33:06,00:33:08,- You're so right.
00:33:08,00:33:09,"- Actually, there'd been many times"
00:33:09,00:33:11,"doing stand-up, I'd be very grateful"
00:33:11,00:33:13,for the fact that booze are also noise.
00:33:13,00:33:16,(all laughing)
00:33:16,00:33:18,"- How did the sugar go, Andy?"
00:33:18,00:33:19,"Well, they were very loud."
00:33:19,00:33:22,(all laughing)
00:33:22,00:33:23,- More vomiting caterpillars?
00:33:23,00:33:24,"- Yes, please."
00:33:24,00:33:27,"- The caterpillars of the small, muttled willow moth."
00:33:27,00:33:30,"They vomit, not just what's in the stomach,"
00:33:30,00:33:32,but also kind of a detergent.
00:33:32,00:33:34,And they do this onto ants.
00:33:34,00:33:36,And the reason being that they have a lot
00:33:36,00:33:38,of kind of water in their stomach.
00:33:38,00:33:40,"So when they vomit it onto the ants,"
00:33:40,00:33:43,this detergent kind of stops the surface tension
00:33:43,00:33:46,of the water from being a blob on the ants' head.
00:33:46,00:33:48,"And instead, the water goes all over the ants,"
00:33:48,00:33:50,and then he has to kind of clean it off
00:33:50,00:33:51,otherwise he'll drown.
00:33:51,00:33:52,- Oh wow.
00:33:52,00:33:55,"- And so, yeah, it's amazing."
00:33:55,00:33:56,"- I thought you meant like a detergent,"
00:33:56,00:33:59,"like if I had a big boozy night out, I'd vomit"
00:33:59,00:34:00,"and be like, I need to clean that up."
00:34:00,00:34:01,"Oh no, I don't."
00:34:01,00:34:02,It's just cleaned itself up.
00:34:02,00:34:04,(all laughing)
00:34:04,00:34:06,That would be a great bit of evolution.
00:34:06,00:34:07,"- Yeah, I think if you just had to vomit"
00:34:07,00:34:09,into the washing machine before you guys did.
00:34:09,00:34:11,(all laughing)
00:34:11,00:34:14,"- Did you know that, so really about caterpillar vomit,"
00:34:14,00:34:16,the evolutionary biologist and a lot of the articles
00:34:16,00:34:20,who studies caterpillars vomiting is called Jane Yak.
00:34:20,00:34:21,(all laughing)
00:34:21,00:34:23,"- No, that's not a good one."
00:34:23,00:34:25,- There is a species of caterpillar
00:34:25,00:34:26,that lives on coca leaves.
00:34:26,00:34:28,"And when they vomit on predators,"
00:34:28,00:34:30,the vomit contains cocaine.
00:34:30,00:34:31,- Whoa.
00:34:31,00:34:32,- Whoa.
00:34:32,00:34:34,- Which presumably the predators don't like
00:34:34,00:34:35,for whatever reason.
00:34:35,00:34:36,- Right.
00:34:36,00:34:38,- But it itself is not high all the time
00:34:38,00:34:40,on cocaine for the eating it.
00:34:40,00:34:43,"- Yeah, so it doesn't metabolize the cocaine"
00:34:43,00:34:45,to make it go crazy.
00:34:45,00:34:45,- Yeah.
00:34:45,00:34:48,"- But when it's eaten by the predators,"
00:34:48,00:34:50,something happens to them and they don't like it.
00:34:50,00:34:53,"- But is it worth, if you find, where is this?"
00:34:53,00:34:55,"- I don't know, but it must be where coca leaves grow,"
00:34:55,00:34:56,so South America.
00:34:56,00:34:57,- Somewhere in South America.
00:34:57,00:34:59,(all laughing)
00:34:59,00:35:00,- That's so cool.
00:35:00,00:35:01,"- If you find a caterpillar in South America,"
00:35:01,00:35:04,is it worth giving it a snort just in case?
00:35:04,00:35:07,"- No, I don't think so, because it might be one of the other ones."
00:35:07,00:35:09,"So for instance, the East and Tent Caterpillar,"
00:35:09,00:35:12,they'll deliberately eat parts of the cherry leaves
00:35:12,00:35:15,that contain cyanide and they'll vomit out cyanide.
00:35:15,00:35:16,- Wow.
00:35:16,00:35:17,"- Okay, so it's not worth risking it"
00:35:17,00:35:19,for the cocaine high in case you get the cyanide poison.
00:35:19,00:35:20,- Yeah.
00:35:20,00:35:21,"- Yeah, fair enough."
00:35:21,00:35:23,- You know the very hungry caterpillar at the book.
00:35:23,00:35:24,I do.
00:35:24,00:35:27,A copy of that book has been bought every minute
00:35:27,00:35:30,since it was published in 1969.
00:35:30,00:35:31,- No.
00:35:31,00:35:31,- Yes.
00:35:31,00:35:32,- Because shop's closed.
00:35:32,00:35:33,(all laughing)
00:35:33,00:35:35,- It's been unabouraged.
00:35:35,00:35:37,"- Yeah, but the world turns then."
00:35:37,00:35:37,- World turns.
00:35:37,00:35:39,- Shop's open.
00:35:39,00:35:40,- Oh yeah.
00:35:40,00:35:42,- Just when the book shops in Japan are opening for the day.
00:35:42,00:35:43,- That's true.
00:35:43,00:35:44,- So it's-- - Is everything in Japan?
00:35:44,00:35:45,- Yeah.
00:35:45,00:35:47,"It's been translated to every, what I'm saying is"
00:35:47,00:35:49,"that it sold 30 million copies, all right?"
00:35:49,00:35:51,"Otherwise, guys. (all laughing)"
00:35:51,00:35:53,Would you add up all the minutes between 96 and I know.
00:35:53,00:35:55,- But it could have sold them all yesterday.
00:35:55,00:35:56,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:35:56,00:35:57,- Yeah.
00:35:57,00:35:58,- But it didn't because I remember reading it as a child.
00:35:58,00:35:59,- Yay.
00:35:59,00:36:00,- You might have got a free copy.
00:36:00,00:36:02,It might have been like a preview copy.
00:36:02,00:36:03,- It wasn't like a free copy.
00:36:03,00:36:04,"- A copy, a proof copy, yeah."
00:36:04,00:36:05,- There you go.
00:36:05,00:36:06,- But it's been proof copies this whole time.
00:36:06,00:36:08,(all laughing)
00:36:08,00:36:09,This is the year it's finally published.
00:36:09,00:36:10,(all laughing)
00:36:10,00:36:11,- How should we do?
00:36:11,00:36:13,"- No, let's do 30 million copies."
00:36:13,00:36:15,(all laughing)
00:36:15,00:36:17,"- Okay, it's impressive, guys."
00:36:17,00:36:19,"Anyway, but my point is that the plot"
00:36:19,00:36:21,of the very hungry cat footage is completely inaccurate.
00:36:21,00:36:22,- What?
00:36:22,00:36:23,- For one very simple reason.
00:36:23,00:36:25,"'Cause on the first day, he has an orange on the second day,"
00:36:25,00:36:27,"he has two apples, and I'm getting the fruits a bit wrong."
00:36:27,00:36:29,But he eats a lot of stuff over the course of the day.
00:36:29,00:36:30,- He eats some cocaine.
00:36:30,00:36:31,- He eats some cocaine.
00:36:31,00:36:33,- I don't think he read this book.
00:36:33,00:36:34,(all laughing)
00:36:34,00:36:37,What point is that almost all caterpillars
00:36:37,00:36:40,have one specific plant only that they like to feed on.
00:36:40,00:36:43,So the very hungry catapilla is an absurd fiction.
00:36:43,00:36:45,- It should have just been every page.
00:36:45,00:36:47,"- He ate an apple, he ate another bit of apple."
00:36:47,00:36:49,He ate another bit of the same apple.
00:36:49,00:36:51,He ate another bit of the same species of apple.
00:36:51,00:36:54,That's what you're recommending for the sequel.
00:36:54,00:36:55,"- Yeah, I am."
00:36:55,00:36:56,(all laughing)
00:36:56,00:36:59,- Very hungry and factually accurate catapilla.
00:36:59,00:37:01,(all laughing)
00:37:01,00:37:04,"'Cause you know flies vomit, so you're a fly lands on your food"
00:37:04,00:37:06,and then it vomits straight away
00:37:06,00:37:09,because it can't metabolize food internally.
00:37:09,00:37:11,So it takes it in and vomits up its enzymes.
00:37:11,00:37:12,- It's not true.
00:37:12,00:37:13,"- Yeah, that's true."
00:37:13,00:37:17,But one problem that they have is at crime scenes
00:37:17,00:37:19,"because if there's a lot of blood at crime scenes,"
00:37:19,00:37:21,then flies would have come along
00:37:21,00:37:22,and they eat a lot of the blood
00:37:22,00:37:24,and then they vomit on the walls straight away
00:37:24,00:37:26,and they create little blood spatters
00:37:26,00:37:28,and people who are crime scene specialists
00:37:28,00:37:29,have to know to tell the difference
00:37:29,00:37:31,and they're looking really close up at blood spatters
00:37:31,00:37:34,between blood vomited by flies and blood.
00:37:34,00:37:35,- This is amazing.
00:37:35,00:37:38,So what you can do is if people check your hands for blood
00:37:38,00:37:40,"after there's been a crime,"
00:37:40,00:37:42,"you can say, ""Oh, just a fly landed on it"
00:37:42,00:37:43,"and vomited on my hands."""
00:37:43,00:37:45,So I was nowhere near it at the time.
00:37:45,00:37:46,- And on my shirt and on this fat.
00:37:46,00:37:48,(all laughing)
00:37:48,00:37:50,"Oh, there's one fly, man and a lie."
00:37:50,00:37:52,(all laughing)
00:37:52,00:37:53,- And here.
