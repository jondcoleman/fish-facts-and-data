00:00:03,00:00:05,"- Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish."
00:00:05,00:00:08,"Before we get going, we've got a quick, exciting announcement"
00:00:08,00:00:11,"which is that two of our colleagues, Jack and Manu,"
00:00:11,00:00:14,"along with their chef friend, Rosie McKean,"
00:00:14,00:00:16,have just launched a brand new podcast
00:00:16,00:00:18,called Lunchbox Envy.
00:00:18,00:00:20,"- Yes, it's all the most interesting, weird,"
00:00:20,00:00:23,incredible facts about specific foods.
00:00:23,00:00:25,"Every episode is based around a food stuff,"
00:00:25,00:00:29,so bananas or garlic or sausages.
00:00:29,00:00:31,There are a couple of episodes already out now.
00:00:31,00:00:32,More will be released very soon.
00:00:32,00:00:34,They really are fantastic.
00:00:34,00:00:35,"You might have heard Jack and Manu,"
00:00:35,00:00:39,"the elves on our spin-off show, Meet the Elves."
00:00:39,00:00:42,They obviously have the bona fide research credentials
00:00:42,00:00:44,"of QILs, and then Rosie really knows"
00:00:44,00:00:46,what she's talking about in the kitchen.
00:00:46,00:00:47,- I've learned so many amazing things
00:00:47,00:00:49,off the back of listening to these episodes.
00:00:49,00:00:51,All the things that they pull out of their Lunchboxes
00:00:51,00:00:53,"make you just go, what the hell is that?"
00:00:53,00:00:56,"Jack, for example, pulls out a chocolate garlic bar"
00:00:56,00:00:59,which was used by the British Secret Services in the war.
00:00:59,00:01:00,I'd never heard of it before.
00:01:00,00:01:02,"You get these amazing, untold histories,"
00:01:02,00:01:05,but also good advice on food.
00:01:05,00:01:06,"- Yes, in fact, as a result,"
00:01:06,00:01:09,I have started slow cooking sausages.
00:01:09,00:01:10,Find out why.
00:01:10,00:01:11,The good thing about the good advice is
00:01:11,00:01:12,they don't just tell you what to do.
00:01:12,00:01:14,They tell you why certain things work.
00:01:14,00:01:16,It is jam-packed.
00:01:16,00:01:18,"Jam-packed, yeah, very good."
00:01:18,00:01:21,Jam-packed with interesting facts
00:01:21,00:01:24,from why food tastes better if you eat it with your hands.
00:01:24,00:01:26,"There you go, toddlers, you've got it right."
00:01:26,00:01:28,As to how you can turn peanut butter into diamonds
00:01:28,00:01:31,"and make your fortune, go and listen to it right now."
00:01:31,00:01:34,Go to qi.com/lunchbox
00:01:34,00:01:36,or wherever podcasts are available.
00:01:36,00:01:38,"- That's right, so do check it out."
00:01:38,00:01:40,"Lunchbox envy, out now."
00:01:40,00:01:41,"Okay, on with the show."
00:01:41,00:01:44,(dramatic music)
00:01:44,00:01:49,(upbeat music)
00:01:49,00:01:53,(speaking in foreign language)
00:01:53,00:02:00,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:02:00,00:02:02,"of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:02:02,00:02:04,a weekly podcast coming to you
00:02:04,00:02:06,from the QI offices in Hoburn.
00:02:06,00:02:07,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:02:07,00:02:10,"I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:02:10,00:02:12,"Anna Tyshinski, and James Harkin."
00:02:12,00:02:14,"Once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:02:14,00:02:16,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:02:16,00:02:20,"and in a particular order, here we go."
00:02:20,00:02:23,"Starting with fact number one, that is Anna."
00:02:23,00:02:26,"- My fact this week is that every time your heart beats,"
00:02:26,00:02:29,"your memory gets worse,"
00:02:29,00:02:32,but you become better at firing a gun.
00:02:32,00:02:33,- Better at firing a what?
00:02:33,00:02:34,"Sorry, better at firing a gun."
00:02:34,00:02:36,Better at firing a what?
00:02:36,00:02:37,"- I see, I see what's happening."
00:02:37,00:02:38,- You see what I'm doing there?
00:02:38,00:02:41,"- Yeah, you expose some obvious flaws in the system."
00:02:41,00:02:42,"- Your heart beats a lot,"
00:02:42,00:02:44,and I don't feel like I lose my memory
00:02:44,00:02:45,every second in a bit.
00:02:45,00:02:48,"- You are, I think this is useful information to know."
00:02:48,00:02:49,"So if you're ever doing certain things,"
00:02:49,00:02:51,always do it on the offbeat.
00:02:51,00:02:53,"Other things, do it on the onbeat."
00:02:53,00:02:57,And I found this a really interesting study I came across
00:02:57,00:02:59,"about the cardiac cycle, basically,"
00:02:59,00:03:01,"which is the cycle of how your heart beats,"
00:03:01,00:03:04,"which says that in cisterly, which is when it's beating,"
00:03:04,00:03:06,"basically it triggers these barrier receptors,"
00:03:06,00:03:09,"which are nerves in your blood vessels,"
00:03:09,00:03:11,"which clock that the blood vessel is stretching,"
00:03:11,00:03:14,"'cause the heart's just beat, the blood vessel stretches,"
00:03:14,00:03:16,"the barrier receptors send a message to the brain going,"
00:03:16,00:03:17,"""Right, the blood vessels have stretched."
00:03:17,00:03:19,"""This is how much, this is what's going on."""
00:03:19,00:03:23,And it sets off all this activity in your brain
00:03:23,00:03:24,every time your heart beats.
00:03:24,00:03:26,"And all that activity in your brain,"
00:03:26,00:03:27,which is giving your brain all the information
00:03:27,00:03:29,"about exactly how much your heart's beat,"
00:03:29,00:03:33,"how hard, how fast, how much the vessel's expanded,"
00:03:33,00:03:35,that drowns out loads of other stuff
00:03:35,00:03:36,that's happening in your brain.
00:03:36,00:03:38,"So you get worse at lots of stuff,"
00:03:38,00:03:40,like your memory gets worse.
00:03:40,00:03:41,"- How do they test this, Anna?"
00:03:41,00:03:42,- That's a very good question.
00:03:42,00:03:45,They rig people up to ECGs
00:03:45,00:03:49,and they do things like really scare them or they--
00:03:49,00:03:51,- So they have more heartbeats.
00:03:51,00:03:52,Is that what you mean?
00:03:52,00:03:55,"- No, so they test exactly whether they're on cisterly"
00:03:55,00:03:57,"or diastole, if their heart's beating or not beating,"
00:03:57,00:03:59,"and then they scare them with something,"
00:03:59,00:04:02,"and if their heart's on an on beat,"
00:04:02,00:04:04,then their reaction will be slightly slower
00:04:04,00:04:05,than their heartbeats. - Like reaction times.
00:04:05,00:04:07,"- Yeah, and they had people in a rifle range"
00:04:07,00:04:10,and they logged them up to ECGs and they did the same thing.
00:04:10,00:04:10,- I've got two questions.
00:04:10,00:04:13,"One, memory, is this long-term memory"
00:04:13,00:04:16,or is it memory in the moment that it's making worse?
00:04:16,00:04:17,- It's memory in the moment.
00:04:17,00:04:19,"So I think they'd say, what's Ernzo's name?"
00:04:19,00:04:21,What's the name of the person who was that next to you
00:04:21,00:04:22,"yesterday, Dan, and then on the on beat,"
00:04:22,00:04:23,you'd be a bit less--
00:04:23,00:04:25,- Dan is not gonna remember that.
00:04:25,00:04:26,- Any circle step is.
00:04:26,00:04:30,- Question two was to do with the gun.
00:04:30,00:04:31,"So I'd read a study a while ago,"
00:04:31,00:04:34,which is that apparently snipers
00:04:34,00:04:37,like to take their shot in between heartbeats.
00:04:37,00:04:38,- How interesting.
00:04:38,00:04:39,"- Yeah, so they've been doing it wrong."
00:04:39,00:04:42,"- Yeah, that's why they keep missing."
00:04:42,00:04:44,"- Yes, that's why they keep missing."
00:04:44,00:04:46,"- Yeah, well, it's a technique that they do,"
00:04:46,00:04:48,which is it's a bit of meditation prior to it.
00:04:48,00:04:50,"Slow breathing, they time the shot."
00:04:50,00:04:53,Apparently if your heartbeat is raised
00:04:53,00:04:55,and it's much higher than the blood pressure
00:04:55,00:04:57,"on your trigger finger, like pulses will come in there,"
00:04:57,00:04:59,it might make you pull a shot slightly differently.
00:04:59,00:05:01,"- If you ever watch Biaflon,"
00:05:01,00:05:03,which is cross country skiing and then shooting.
00:05:03,00:05:04,- Not at the same time.
00:05:04,00:05:05,- Not at the same time.
00:05:05,00:05:07,And that is the critical point
00:05:07,00:05:09,"because your heart rate gets really, really high"
00:05:09,00:05:12,because you're doing this really big exercise
00:05:12,00:05:13,and then you have to shoot.
00:05:13,00:05:15,"And the best players, the best people"
00:05:15,00:05:18,"like Johannes Tingersboro, people like that,"
00:05:18,00:05:21,"he would like really lower, lower, lower his heart rate."
00:05:21,00:05:23,"And you can see it, they often have it on the screen."
00:05:23,00:05:25,It'll say what their heart rate is
00:05:25,00:05:27,"and you can see it going down, down, down,"
00:05:27,00:05:28,and they won't shoot immediately.
00:05:28,00:05:31,They'll let the heartbeat go down and then they'll shoot.
00:05:31,00:05:32,- That's really cool.
00:05:32,00:05:33,"So they do, okay, yeah."
00:05:33,00:05:35,"- And that makes sense to make the heartbeat go down, I guess,"
00:05:35,00:05:37,"'cause you're more focused, you're more relaxed."
00:05:37,00:05:41,I've watched my own heartbeat during surgery.
00:05:41,00:05:42,- What?
00:05:42,00:05:44,As in the actual heart itself?
00:05:44,00:05:47,"- No, I haven't seen my physical heart pumping away."
00:05:47,00:05:49,"I mean, on a screen, I was having a minor operation"
00:05:49,00:05:51,which I was allowed to stay awake for.
00:05:51,00:05:54,And you can see it.
00:05:54,00:05:56,And they sort of accidentally left the screen
00:05:56,00:05:57,like pointing a bit at my face.
00:05:57,00:05:58,So I was trying to muck around and speed it up
00:05:58,00:05:59,and slow it down.
00:05:59,00:06:00,It's great fun.
00:06:00,00:06:01,"- Were they inside,"
00:06:01,00:06:02,they have something inside your body?
00:06:02,00:06:03,You said that actually.
00:06:03,00:06:04,"- Oh yeah, oh yeah."
00:06:04,00:06:06,"- But you didn't have an open heart surgery, did you?"
00:06:06,00:06:08,"- No, I said a minor operation."
00:06:08,00:06:10,"I like to play it cool,"
00:06:10,00:06:11,but even I would probably say
00:06:11,00:06:12,that's a medium-sized operation.
00:06:12,00:06:15,"- And when they actually put the extension in your penis,"
00:06:15,00:06:17,did your heart rate go up or it made that noise
00:06:17,00:06:18,like a slide or something.
00:06:18,00:06:27,"- Can I just say the potential reason for this,"
00:06:27,00:06:29,"evolutionarily, which I also think is really cool."
00:06:29,00:06:30,"And just to let you know,"
00:06:30,00:06:32,"is that when your heart doesn't beat,"
00:06:32,00:06:34,your sensitivity to pain goes down.
00:06:34,00:06:36,"You have a worse memory for words,"
00:06:36,00:06:37,"your concentration is less good,"
00:06:37,00:06:39,"you've got higher fear response,"
00:06:39,00:06:41,"so you're more afraid, more intense reaction,"
00:06:41,00:06:43,but your reactions are slower.
00:06:43,00:06:44,"And then on the offbeat,"
00:06:44,00:06:46,"you have a stronger grip,"
00:06:46,00:06:47,"so you're stronger,"
00:06:47,00:06:49,"you're more accurate at firing a gun,"
00:06:49,00:06:51,and your eyes flicker around more.
00:06:51,00:06:53,"And weirdly, I didn't know what happens is"
00:06:53,00:06:55,"when you're under threat,"
00:06:55,00:06:56,what do you think happens to your heart rate?
00:06:56,00:06:58,"- Speeds up, speeds up."
00:06:58,00:06:59,- Incorrect.
00:06:59,00:06:59,- What?
00:06:59,00:07:01,- Isn't this incredible?
00:07:01,00:07:03,"Immediately after you're under threat,"
00:07:03,00:07:05,usually your heartbeat for a second slows down.
00:07:05,00:07:07,"Apparently, in an evolutionary sense,"
00:07:07,00:07:10,"and that's because for a second,"
00:07:10,00:07:12,it needs to be on the offbeat more often.
00:07:12,00:07:14,"So when your heartbeat goes slower,"
00:07:14,00:07:16,"it's more often on the offbeat,"
00:07:16,00:07:18,so that you can have fast reactions
00:07:18,00:07:20,and process information more.
00:07:20,00:07:21,"So you process everything around you,"
00:07:21,00:07:23,"and then it speeds up a lot,"
00:07:23,00:07:24,"because as soon as you've done that,"
00:07:24,00:07:26,"then it's on the onbeat,"
00:07:26,00:07:28,"and then you're really good at firing a gun,"
00:07:28,00:07:30,"or punching someone, or gripping something."
00:07:30,00:07:31,- I would've thought it would be a part of
00:07:31,00:07:33,"just trying to be quiet, like more quiet,"
00:07:33,00:07:35,so they don't find you.
00:07:35,00:07:36,Not having that pumping heartbeat.
00:07:36,00:07:38,"- Just as psychologically, you'd be like,"
00:07:38,00:07:41,"you can hear, you know, you'd be like,"
00:07:41,00:07:43,- Can I just ask for clarification?
00:07:43,00:07:45,"If your heartbeat slows down,"
00:07:45,00:07:47,"and you go from 100 beats to 50 beats,"
00:07:47,00:07:51,that means you also have 50 offbeats in a minute.
00:07:51,00:07:53,So does that not mean you have fewer offbeats
00:07:53,00:07:54,as opposed to more?
00:07:54,00:07:57,"- I think it's more time is spent on an off,"
00:07:57,00:07:59,"so you've got a longer offbeat,"
00:07:59,00:08:01,'cause like an onbeat is always going to be
00:08:01,00:08:03,"the same amount of time your heart takes to go,"
00:08:03,00:08:05,"but to pump the blood out, right?"
00:08:05,00:08:07,"But then between them, there's a longer gap."
00:08:07,00:08:09,- So the offbeat is actually the gap
00:08:09,00:08:11,between your heart pumping and not pumping.
00:08:11,00:08:13,- Exactly.
00:08:13,00:08:15,"And this was only in one study that it said,"
00:08:15,00:08:17,usually the fear response causes your heart
00:08:17,00:08:18,"to immediately slow down and speed up,"
00:08:18,00:08:20,"and I couldn't find it many other places,"
00:08:20,00:08:21,but I thought that was fascinating.
00:08:21,00:08:22,- That was very cool.
00:08:22,00:08:26,Heartbeats are something that I didn't realize
00:08:26,00:08:29,play quite a feature role in the world of music.
00:08:29,00:08:33,- Heartbeats is a single by steps.
00:08:33,00:08:34,But there you go.
00:08:34,00:08:34,- Is that what you're thinking?
00:08:34,00:08:35,- That's not what I'm thinking.
00:08:35,00:08:38,"I mean, artists recording their heartbeats"
00:08:38,00:08:42,or their of their children and putting them into songs
00:08:42,00:08:43,have been used multiple times.
00:08:43,00:08:46,"You've get them in print songs in John Lennon,"
00:08:46,00:08:50,very sadly released it as part of an ultrasound heartbeat
00:08:50,00:08:53,"to a child that unfortunately didn't make it full term,"
00:08:53,00:08:55,but so many bands.
00:08:55,00:08:59,"Max Cavallera from Sepultura, he did it."
00:08:59,00:09:03,"Interestingly, Taylor Swift did it for one of her songs, right?"
00:09:03,00:09:07,"And it was a song that was re-recorded as you might remember,"
00:09:07,00:09:09,Taylor Swift had this huge moment
00:09:09,00:09:13,whereby she had her manager claim all of her music.
00:09:13,00:09:15,So she went and re-recorded every single album.
00:09:15,00:09:16,- I do remember.
00:09:16,00:09:18,- So one of these songs contains her heartbeat.
00:09:18,00:09:22,So she had to replicate the sound recording of her heartbeat.
00:09:22,00:09:25,"So she's got twice recorded heartbeats into tracks,"
00:09:25,00:09:27,but they all get listed in the song credits
00:09:27,00:09:29,"on heartbeat, Taylor Swift."
00:09:29,00:09:30,- Very nice.
00:09:30,00:09:31,- So it means you get more money.
00:09:31,00:09:32,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:09:32,00:09:34,- That's like Phil Collins.
00:09:34,00:09:35,"Do you remember Phil Collins, didn't he do an album"
00:09:35,00:09:37,where it was all Phil Collins?
00:09:37,00:09:39,And I think he put himself in the credits as everything.
00:09:39,00:09:42,- So he played like the kazoo when he played it.
00:09:42,00:09:44,(all laughing)
00:09:44,00:09:48,"- Huge kazoo guy, Collins, yeah, yeah."
00:09:48,00:09:48,"- You can't just add more on,"
00:09:48,00:09:49,you can't just add a triangle
00:09:49,00:09:51,"and get paid a whole extra bit, can't you?"
00:09:51,00:09:52,"- Well, you can, that's the whole idea."
00:09:52,00:09:54,"So Simon Cowell, that was a story"
00:09:54,00:09:56,"that he would play a minor instrument,"
00:09:56,00:09:58,"like one cowbell noise,"
00:09:58,00:10:00,and that would be writer's credits on the songs
00:10:00,00:10:02,to all his audits that he would get.
00:10:02,00:10:04,- And that's why we renamed it the cowbell.
00:10:04,00:10:05,But no one knows.
00:10:05,00:10:06,- It's so beautiful.
00:10:06,00:10:07,- It's so beautiful.
00:10:07,00:10:08,- Very good.
00:10:08,00:10:10,"- When your heart rate synchronizes,"
00:10:10,00:10:11,"we've briefly mentioned before, I think,"
00:10:11,00:10:15,"that it's choirs, their heartbeats all synchronized."
00:10:15,00:10:16,It's pretty cool.
00:10:16,00:10:17,- That is cool.
00:10:17,00:10:20,"- When you go to the theater,"
00:10:20,00:10:22,your heart also synchronizes with the people around you.
00:10:22,00:10:25,And it lasts into the interval.
00:10:25,00:10:26,"Everyone goes out into the interval,"
00:10:26,00:10:28,"with their hearts speeding up,"
00:10:28,00:10:29,sort of going at the same rate.
00:10:29,00:10:31,- I wonder why we all go to the toilet
00:10:31,00:10:32,at exactly the same moment
00:10:32,00:10:35,when there's like five minutes left before the second half.
00:10:35,00:10:37,"'Cause our hearts is the problem, isn't it?"
00:10:37,00:10:37,- It's the problem.
00:10:37,00:10:41,- But so that's saying that a movie has a heart rate.
00:10:41,00:10:43,"- Yes, it does."
00:10:43,00:10:44,"- So you could actually probably,"
00:10:44,00:10:47,"you know we talked before about how you could do CPR,"
00:10:47,00:10:49,"singing a certain type of song,"
00:10:49,00:10:51,because it's the right BPM in order to do it.
00:10:51,00:10:52,"There probably is, like, if you want to go to a movie"
00:10:52,00:10:54,that puts you on this heart rate.
00:10:54,00:10:55,"- No, 'cause it'll go up and down."
00:10:55,00:10:57,"So you'd be caught if it was Titanic, you know,"
00:10:57,00:10:58,"as the ship cracks in half,"
00:10:58,00:11:00,you suddenly have to double the rate of CPR.
00:11:00,00:11:01,"- Oh yeah, but I'm sure there's some like,"
00:11:01,00:11:03,how long are you going to do? - How long are you going to do?
00:11:03,00:11:04,- Movies where you can just sit for...
00:11:04,00:11:06,"- If you're like, if it's something really tedious,"
00:11:06,00:11:09,"like June two, you can just sit all the way through it."
00:11:09,00:11:12,"- That's too slow, the person would die."
00:11:12,00:11:15,"- But if it's something really exciting, yeah, then..."
00:11:15,00:11:16,"I mean, you don't need to do it for long."
00:11:16,00:11:18,How long do you need to do CPR for normally?
00:11:18,00:11:19,If you...
00:11:19,00:11:20,- It's all the way through.
00:11:20,00:11:23,"- Okay, yeah, I've done 45 seconds now."
00:11:23,00:11:24,I'm afraid we've watched the whole
00:11:24,00:11:26,"of the climactic fight scene in Gladiator,"
00:11:26,00:11:28,"so I am going to be clocking off, yeah."
00:11:28,00:11:31,"Pig hearts, you know how we were all going to get"
00:11:31,00:11:33,pig hearts a while ago? - Oh yeah.
00:11:33,00:11:33,- That was going to be the big thing.
00:11:33,00:11:35,"- I know, I was so excited."
00:11:35,00:11:37,"- It's so complicated, the process."
00:11:37,00:11:39,'Cause basically pigs are very similar to people
00:11:39,00:11:40,in lots of ways physiologically.
00:11:40,00:11:42,And there was an idea that we were going to be able
00:11:42,00:11:46,to transplant pig hearts into people.
00:11:46,00:11:48,"And that was going to be, 'cause there are loads of pigs,"
00:11:48,00:11:50,"I mean, there are hundreds of millions of pigs"
00:11:50,00:11:52,"around the world. - Sure, just sitting there"
00:11:52,00:11:55,"with their hearts beating away and around, oink oink."
00:11:55,00:11:56,"- We're not using them for anything, right?"
00:11:56,00:11:57,- Exactly.
00:11:57,00:12:00,- So let's steal their hearts for us.
00:12:00,00:12:02,It's pretty sinister as a species.
00:12:02,00:12:04,"Anyway, but it turns out you have to do so much stuff,"
00:12:04,00:12:06,you have to make the pig more human before you do this.
00:12:06,00:12:07,- How do you do that?
00:12:07,00:12:07,Dress it up.
00:12:07,00:12:10,- Give it a newspaper.
00:12:10,00:12:11,- Sprig it to the movies.
00:12:11,00:12:13,"- Like grandma, what big trotters you have?"
00:12:13,00:12:17,"Yeah, it's so, no, you can't just take a,"
00:12:17,00:12:19,like take a heart out of a pig and shove it in the person.
00:12:19,00:12:22,"You have to take a pig, right?"
00:12:22,00:12:25,"Remove three of its genes, knock out some growth hormones."
00:12:25,00:12:27,- So you have to dress it up.
00:12:27,00:12:29,- Knock out some growth hormones.
00:12:29,00:12:30,Add a couple of other genes.
00:12:30,00:12:32,"Then you have to keep the pig nice and clean,"
00:12:32,00:12:33,so it doesn't get any pig bacteria.
00:12:33,00:12:38,"Then you breed from that pig and you make these GM embryos,"
00:12:38,00:12:40,"you put them in surrogate cells,"
00:12:40,00:12:42,and then you have to give the mummy pig a C-section
00:12:42,00:12:44,so that it doesn't get contaminated at all.
00:12:44,00:12:46,And then those piglets have to be bred up
00:12:46,00:12:47,until they're big enough.
00:12:47,00:12:48,- Wow.
00:12:48,00:12:50,- And those are then the sort of a bit more human pigs.
00:12:50,00:12:52,"They've had no contact with the outside world,"
00:12:52,00:12:53,no external viruses.
00:12:53,00:12:54,Those are the ones that--
00:12:54,00:12:55,- And has anyone ever had this?
00:12:55,00:12:57,"- I think two people have, and they both didn't survive."
00:12:57,00:12:59,"- Well, one of them built a house out of straw,"
00:12:59,00:13:00,"the other one built a house out of sticks,"
00:13:00,00:13:02,and they never made it.
00:13:02,00:13:04,- No wonder we don't use it.
00:13:04,00:13:06,"You got to, it's like, we found a match,"
00:13:06,00:13:08,we now just have to get it pregnant.
00:13:08,00:13:11,- By it didn't first.
00:13:11,00:13:14,"- Let it birth some, and then take their hearts."
00:13:14,00:13:15,"- Anna's right, a couple of people have had it,"
00:13:15,00:13:17,"but I think it didn't, it didn't--"
00:13:17,00:13:19,- I think the reason is like hearts in all mammals
00:13:19,00:13:22,"are kind of the same, aren't they really?"
00:13:22,00:13:22,- Right.
00:13:22,00:13:25,"- They all work the same way with electrical impulses,"
00:13:25,00:13:27,and they have sodium and potassium
00:13:27,00:13:28,"that make the electricity happen,"
00:13:28,00:13:30,"and they're all kind of the same, so that's the idea."
00:13:30,00:13:34,"- Is it right that we have a billion beats, all mammals?"
00:13:34,00:13:34,- Three billion.
00:13:34,00:13:36,"- We've got roughly the same number, yeah."
00:13:36,00:13:37,- Humans get about three billion.
00:13:37,00:13:38,"Humans get a bit more, basically,"
00:13:38,00:13:41,'cause our life is longer because we have invented indoors.
00:13:41,00:13:44,"And indoors is a more relaxing environment, and--"
00:13:44,00:13:45,- But like we're similar enough
00:13:45,00:13:46,that we have roughly the same--
00:13:46,00:13:49,"- You do, but it's not like you have that number."
00:13:49,00:13:51,"Like Donald Trump thinks that you have a certain number,"
00:13:51,00:13:53,"and if you use them up, then that's when you die."
00:13:53,00:13:55,And that's why he doesn't like to do any exercise
00:13:55,00:13:57,apart from play golf.
00:13:57,00:13:59,And I think a few other famous people have thought that.
00:13:59,00:14:00,Maybe Neil Armstrong thought that.
00:14:00,00:14:03,"- I think, I think, yeah, yeah, no, there's a quote."
00:14:03,00:14:05,I think they've looked into it.
00:14:05,00:14:06,"- Maybe as a joke, he said, ""You only get a certain amount,"
00:14:06,00:14:08,"""and I'm down if I'm gonna use all mine"
00:14:08,00:14:09,"""running up and down the street."""
00:14:09,00:14:10,"- Oh, well, that's a funny line."
00:14:10,00:14:12,"- That's interesting, when you're playing golf,"
00:14:12,00:14:15,"because it is reduced, is it better to play in the gaps?"
00:14:15,00:14:17,"- Well, you know what, I'd never thought that before,"
00:14:17,00:14:18,but I'm gonna try that next time on the course.
00:14:18,00:14:21,"- Yeah, I think that's why small animals"
00:14:21,00:14:22,"don't live as long, isn't it?"
00:14:22,00:14:23,"'Cause as a small animal, you have to,"
00:14:23,00:14:26,your heart beats faster and so use them up.
00:14:26,00:14:27,- I got one last thing before we move on.
00:14:27,00:14:30,Have you guys heard of the Intimacy 2.0 dress?
00:14:30,00:14:31,- No.
00:14:31,00:14:33,"- No, okay, let me guess."
00:14:33,00:14:34,It's a dress you wear.
00:14:34,00:14:35,- Correct.
00:14:35,00:14:39,"- And two people wear it, and it syncs your heartbeats,"
00:14:39,00:14:41,and it changes color with the heartbeats
00:14:41,00:14:44,so you can see that each is flashing at the same time
00:14:44,00:14:45,and that you're in sync.
00:14:45,00:14:47,"- Is it like a dress version of paddles, basically?"
00:14:47,00:14:49,(all laugh)
00:14:49,00:14:51,"- Aggressively stops your heart and restarts in that,"
00:14:51,00:14:53,tell you what I'm saying.
00:14:53,00:14:54,"- No, no."
00:14:54,00:14:55,- Does it change color?
00:14:55,00:14:59,Does it go transparent if your heart rate rises?
00:14:59,00:14:59,- There we go.
00:14:59,00:15:02,- Is that what Kanye West's partner was wearing?
00:15:02,00:15:04,She was just so excited to be at the Grammys.
00:15:04,00:15:06,Her heart was going 10 a second.
00:15:06,00:15:07,- But it's basically that.
00:15:07,00:15:08,So it's a dress that you would wear.
00:15:08,00:15:11,"Obviously no one is wearing this, as far as I can tell."
00:15:11,00:15:14,"And it's got a neckline that plunges to the midriff,"
00:15:14,00:15:17,"which if your heart rate rises and you're out on a date,"
00:15:17,00:15:20,"it slowly makes the dress more transparent around these,"
00:15:20,00:15:22,"yeah, sort of like the cleavage area and so on,"
00:15:22,00:15:24,"in order to, yeah."
00:15:24,00:15:26,So it's just enhancing.
00:15:26,00:15:27,"- In the woods, you're wearing it"
00:15:27,00:15:29,and you're threatened by a lion.
00:15:29,00:15:31,Now the lion's seen your naked flesh exposed.
00:15:31,00:15:33,That makes the duration even worse.
00:15:33,00:15:34,"- Well, fortunately, when you're panicked,"
00:15:34,00:15:35,your heart rate goes down.
00:15:35,00:15:36,So you should be fine.
00:15:36,00:15:36,- Good point.
00:15:36,00:15:38,- Have you learned nothing from this section?
00:15:38,00:15:39,- Where'd she go?
00:15:39,00:15:40,(all laugh)
00:15:40,00:15:42,(upbeat music)
00:15:42,00:15:46,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two"
00:15:46,00:15:48,and that is James.
00:15:48,00:15:51,"- Okay, my fact this week is that in 2023,"
00:15:51,00:15:53,a team mapping the ocean floor
00:15:53,00:15:57,announced they may have found Amelia Earhart's plane.
00:15:57,00:16:00,"In 2024, they announced it was actually"
00:16:00,00:16:02,a plane-shaped pile of rocks.
00:16:02,00:16:03,(all laugh)
00:16:03,00:16:04,- Could they not have looked a bit closer
00:16:04,00:16:05,the first time round?
00:16:05,00:16:06,Got a second opinion.
00:16:06,00:16:07,"- It's at the bottom of the sea, Anna."
00:16:07,00:16:08,"- Ah, it's very hot."
00:16:08,00:16:12,It's amazing they found such a plane-shaped pile of rocks.
00:16:12,00:16:14,It would have been cool if they had just announced
00:16:14,00:16:16,we found a wicked pile of rocks shaped like a plane down there.
00:16:16,00:16:17,- Yeah.
00:16:17,00:16:18,- But they had to go a bit further
00:16:18,00:16:20,and say it's one of the most famous lost planes ever.
00:16:20,00:16:22,"- Yeah, so this is Amelia Earhart."
00:16:22,00:16:24,We've mentioned her once or twice before.
00:16:24,00:16:27,She was flying around the world in 1937
00:16:27,00:16:29,and she was about 100 miles from a place
00:16:29,00:16:32,"called Howland Island, which is in Kiribati."
00:16:32,00:16:34,And she started running out of fuel
00:16:34,00:16:37,"and we never heard from her again, basically."
00:16:37,00:16:40,She gave one last radio call and then disappeared
00:16:40,00:16:43,"and for the subsequent 90 years,"
00:16:43,00:16:45,people have been wondering what's happened to her.
00:16:45,00:16:46,- Yeah.
00:16:46,00:16:48,"And she was really, she was well-famous wasn't she?"
00:16:48,00:16:49,"- Oh yeah, yeah."
00:16:49,00:16:51,- Incredibly celebrated aviate tricks.
00:16:51,00:16:54,"- Yeah, prior to the disappearance as well, which is-"
00:16:54,00:16:54,"- Yeah, absolutely."
00:16:54,00:16:56,- Often sometimes these things make you.
00:16:56,00:16:59,- She broke in so many records and things like that
00:16:59,00:17:00,"and she'd done a lot of trips,"
00:17:00,00:17:02,which was the first time a woman might have made those flights
00:17:02,00:17:03,and things like that.
00:17:03,00:17:04,She was amazing.
00:17:04,00:17:06,"- And this is a group called Deepsea Vision,"
00:17:06,00:17:08,"the CEO, Tony Romeo,"
00:17:08,00:17:11,"who's a former U.S. Air Force intelligence officer,"
00:17:11,00:17:13,said that they'd found these.
00:17:13,00:17:14,(laughs)
00:17:14,00:17:15,Rocks said that they found this plane
00:17:15,00:17:16,or what they thought was a plane
00:17:16,00:17:17,and then they've done a bit more work
00:17:17,00:17:20,and they realized that it is some rocks.
00:17:20,00:17:23,"And Tony said, ""Talk about the cruelest formation"
00:17:23,00:17:25,"""ever created by nature."""
00:17:25,00:17:25,- Yeah.
00:17:25,00:17:26,- And I can only agree.
00:17:26,00:17:27,"- 'Cause it was, yeah,"
00:17:27,00:17:28,"it's a hundred miles from Holland Island, right?"
00:17:28,00:17:30,So if you see a plane shape.
00:17:30,00:17:31,"- I don't mean to be morbid,"
00:17:31,00:17:32,"but when a plane hits the water,"
00:17:32,00:17:34,"it often, especially a 1930s plane,"
00:17:34,00:17:37,it might not stay looking like a pristine plane
00:17:37,00:17:39,"all the way to the ocean bottom, you know?"
00:17:39,00:17:40,- Absolutely.
00:17:40,00:17:41,And what were they using to see it?
00:17:41,00:17:44,Was it like a sonar thing that sent back a vague shape?
00:17:44,00:17:45,- The image does look pretty good.
00:17:45,00:17:46,- Is it very plain?
00:17:46,00:17:48,"- Oh yeah, it's even got a little tail fin on it."
00:17:48,00:17:49,"- Yeah, it looks very plain like."
00:17:49,00:17:50,- Does it?
00:17:50,00:17:52,- It was a huge search for her at the time.
00:17:52,00:17:54,"As in, the U.S. Navy did a lot of searching."
00:17:54,00:17:57,"They even sent, I think, an aircraft carrier"
00:17:57,00:18:00,"to the region, which had 63 aircraft on it."
00:18:00,00:18:03,"So, you know, all those planes can go out making trips."
00:18:03,00:18:04,"- I thought you meant like an empty one,"
00:18:04,00:18:07,optimistically hoping to carry her aircraft back.
00:18:07,00:18:07,(laughs)
00:18:07,00:18:10,"- Yeah, and it cost them about four million U.S. dollars"
00:18:10,00:18:14,"at the time, it was about 90 million U.S. dollars today."
00:18:14,00:18:16,"This, and of course they didn't find her."
00:18:16,00:18:18,And actually that became kind of the end
00:18:18,00:18:21,"of celebrity aviation because at that time,"
00:18:21,00:18:24,the loads of celebrity flyers who were doing loads
00:18:24,00:18:26,of crazy stunts and everyone that they're on the front page
00:18:26,00:18:30,"of all the newspapers, but when Emilia Earhart disappeared,"
00:18:30,00:18:32,Congress decided to make it illegal for the Navy
00:18:32,00:18:34,to spend any money on search and rescue.
00:18:34,00:18:36,"And when they did that, everyone just stopped"
00:18:36,00:18:37,carrying a little bit.
00:18:37,00:18:38,- Wow.
00:18:38,00:18:40,"- Yeah, there were all these psychics who were claiming"
00:18:40,00:18:41,that they were in touch with her.
00:18:41,00:18:43,And the family were looking for anything.
00:18:43,00:18:45,"So, they were going to see psychics"
00:18:45,00:18:47,and hoping to follow up on things.
00:18:47,00:18:48,"There was this story that we mentioned briefly,"
00:18:48,00:18:50,which was the Tokyo Rose story.
00:18:50,00:18:52,It's the idea that the Japanese had got hold
00:18:52,00:18:54,"of Emilia Earhart, she was captured,"
00:18:54,00:18:57,and she was putting out propaganda radio news
00:18:57,00:18:58,about what was going on in the war.
00:18:58,00:19:00,"- So, Tokyo Rose was real, right?"
00:19:00,00:19:01,- Yeah.
00:19:01,00:19:02,"- That was actually, but they were saying that that was her."
00:19:02,00:19:03,"- That was, they were saying it was her,"
00:19:03,00:19:05,"but what's interesting is her husband,"
00:19:05,00:19:07,"'cause she was married, Emilia Earhart,"
00:19:07,00:19:08,to a guy called George Putnam.
00:19:08,00:19:10,He actually made a three-day trek
00:19:10,00:19:12,through a Japanese-held territory
00:19:12,00:19:14,so that he could get to a US Marine radio station
00:19:14,00:19:16,to confirm whether or not it was her voice.
00:19:16,00:19:18,"So, it was taken really seriously,"
00:19:18,00:19:20,"even by the immediate family, some of these,"
00:19:20,00:19:21,some of these theories.
00:19:21,00:19:22,- I think that was one of the ones
00:19:22,00:19:24,that vaguely sane people believe.
00:19:24,00:19:25,- Yeah.
00:19:25,00:19:26,- The person who was in charge of the island.
00:19:26,00:19:28,"I have to say, I find that Emilia Earhart searches,"
00:19:28,00:19:31,I have a real blank like with Jack the Ripper on them.
00:19:31,00:19:33,"I'm like, ""God, get a life, guys."""
00:19:33,00:19:35,"A lot of them, no offence."
00:19:35,00:19:36,- Interesting.
00:19:36,00:19:37,"- Also, welcome to the podcast."
00:19:37,00:19:39,We appreciate you listening.
00:19:39,00:19:41,- It's interesting you've made these people your bet noir.
00:19:41,00:19:42,- I don't know why.
00:19:42,00:19:43,"- The people, relatively blind-minded people,"
00:19:43,00:19:45,trying to solve a classic mystery.
00:19:45,00:19:47,- New enemies of the podcast.
00:19:47,00:19:47,- Yeah.
00:19:47,00:19:49,"- I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry."
00:19:49,00:19:50,You can buy stuff from their website.
00:19:50,00:19:52,"Look, I'll advertise for them."
00:19:52,00:19:54,"They sell little, they sell t-shirts, they sell badges."
00:19:54,00:19:57,"If you wanna help fund their expeditions,"
00:19:57,00:20:01,"each trip costs up to $500,000 to go and uncover"
00:20:01,00:20:03,another rusty jackknife or compact mirror in the ocean
00:20:03,00:20:05,that you say belong to Emilia Earhart.
00:20:05,00:20:06,- Sounds good.
00:20:06,00:20:07,- Okay.
00:20:07,00:20:09,- So just on sort of the ocean
00:20:09,00:20:11,and the mysteries of the ocean.
00:20:11,00:20:14,"Something that I read about, which is a big problem"
00:20:14,00:20:19,"for a lot of boats out in the open sea now, is UFOs."
00:20:19,00:20:19,"- Oh, no."
00:20:19,00:20:24,- Unidentified floating objects.
00:20:24,00:20:26,So this is to do with container ships.
00:20:26,00:20:28,"And container ships, when they're in rough seas,"
00:20:28,00:20:31,"they can lose, so many containers have gone missing."
00:20:31,00:20:34,"There was an estimate between 1985 and 2007,"
00:20:34,00:20:37,five to six million container units
00:20:37,00:20:37,would be floating--
00:20:37,00:20:38,"- Wow, it's mental."
00:20:38,00:20:39,"- Yeah, and--"
00:20:39,00:20:40,- Do they all float?
00:20:40,00:20:42,"- They do for a while, so they can for a few weeks."
00:20:42,00:20:44,"If a container is up to 80% full,"
00:20:44,00:20:46,"then you've got enough air in there for it to,"
00:20:46,00:20:47,"but they're not airtight,"
00:20:47,00:20:50,so they will eventually seep water and go down.
00:20:50,00:20:52,"So a lot of ships just say that if they're out,"
00:20:52,00:20:54,"these come out of nowhere, 'cause they're not mapped right."
00:20:54,00:20:58,So you're dodging UFOs all the way through the ocean.
00:20:58,00:20:59,- Wow.
00:20:59,00:21:01,"- Yeah, we're just constantly losing giant containers"
00:21:01,00:21:02,off the back of ships.
00:21:02,00:21:05,- Other mysterious things in the ocean.
00:21:05,00:21:06,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:21:06,00:21:08,"- Well, one big ocean mystery is,"
00:21:08,00:21:10,you know all the plastic in the ocean?
00:21:10,00:21:11,"- Yes, yeah."
00:21:11,00:21:13,"- Well, where is it?"
00:21:13,00:21:13,- In the ocean.
00:21:13,00:21:14,- It's not nearly enough there.
00:21:14,00:21:16,"- It's in the garbage patch, isn't it?"
00:21:16,00:21:17,"- Well, not nearly enough, James."
00:21:17,00:21:18,- What do you mean?
00:21:18,00:21:19,"- Let's get more in there, guys."
00:21:19,00:21:22,"- Yeah, what is the problem you're trying to solve here?"
00:21:22,00:21:23,- This plastic.
00:21:23,00:21:24,- It's in animals.
00:21:24,00:21:26,"- No, we don't know, so you,"
00:21:26,00:21:27,"well, we're starting to find out,"
00:21:27,00:21:30,but basically 99% of the plastic
00:21:30,00:21:32,that should be in the ocean is not in the ocean.
00:21:32,00:21:33,"We keep on looking,"
00:21:33,00:21:36,"and most of what is there is in the garbage patch,"
00:21:36,00:21:38,"but a lot of that is kind of old plastic,"
00:21:38,00:21:40,"and we don't know where the newer plastic's gone,"
00:21:40,00:21:41,whereas you'd think the older plastic
00:21:41,00:21:43,"would be the stuff that degrades, if anything,"
00:21:43,00:21:45,and is getting smaller and disappearing.
00:21:45,00:21:48,"- So when you say it's not there, sorry, what do you mean?"
00:21:48,00:21:51,"- So in the surveys that we've done of the ocean,"
00:21:51,00:21:53,"looking at how much ocean plastic there is,"
00:21:53,00:21:55,we haven't found nearly enough to equate
00:21:55,00:21:59,"with how much we estimate we've been flushing into the ocean,"
00:21:59,00:22:00,"and it's called dark plastic,"
00:22:00,00:22:02,and they equate it with dark matter.
00:22:02,00:22:03,"- I knew, I knew."
00:22:03,00:22:05,The climate change was a hoax
00:22:05,00:22:07,in this whole environmental push.
00:22:07,00:22:08,I knew it.
00:22:08,00:22:09,"- It's actually not,"
00:22:09,00:22:11,"it's only quite for the climate change,"
00:22:11,00:22:12,but it's not quite the same.
00:22:12,00:22:13,"- Yeah, but that's crazy."
00:22:13,00:22:14,"- So is this scary, Anna?"
00:22:14,00:22:16,'Cause presumably it's somewhere bad.
00:22:16,00:22:19,"- No, it's actually somewhere good."
00:22:19,00:22:21,"I think the latest research shows,"
00:22:21,00:22:22,and this is great news.
00:22:22,00:22:25,"- Anna, this is a roller coaster of the fair."
00:22:25,00:22:28,- I like to keep your heart beats fluctuating.
00:22:28,00:22:31,"The latest research is a guy called Lauren Lebriton,"
00:22:31,00:22:34,"who's an oceanographer who ran this big computer model,"
00:22:34,00:22:36,looking at how the plastic that we know about
00:22:36,00:22:38,"gets distributed, where it lands in the ocean,"
00:22:38,00:22:39,where it floats to and stuff.
00:22:39,00:22:42,He's concluded that the vast majority
00:22:42,00:22:44,"of macro plastics and micro plastics,"
00:22:44,00:22:46,"so big and small bits,"
00:22:46,00:22:48,rather than being lost in the middle of the ocean
00:22:48,00:22:49,"or deep down where we don't know,"
00:22:49,00:22:52,they actually all wash up on beaches
00:22:52,00:22:54,on a buried in shorelines or a right on the coastline.
00:22:54,00:22:55,- Interesting.
00:22:55,00:22:56,"- Which to me says, great,"
00:22:56,00:22:58,I always thought we can't get that plastic back.
00:22:58,00:23:00,I can't row out to sea and get it back.
00:23:00,00:23:02,But if all you need to do is go to a beach.
00:23:02,00:23:03,"- That's great, we just need to pick up"
00:23:03,00:23:05,the baby turtles it's choked to death on the beach.
00:23:05,00:23:06,"- Well, it's amazing."
00:23:06,00:23:08,- Under the beach is the lug worms who are getting it back.
00:23:08,00:23:09,- Oh no.
00:23:09,00:23:10,"- I know the lug, the poor lugs."
00:23:10,00:23:11,No one talks about them.
00:23:11,00:23:12,- And it's gonna turn out the lug worms
00:23:12,00:23:15,"with a keystone species keeping this whole thing going,"
00:23:15,00:23:16,and we'll be sorry.
00:23:16,00:23:17,That's really interesting though.
00:23:17,00:23:19,"- It just seems more accessible, doesn't it?"
00:23:19,00:23:21,- Does it make it easier for us to deal with
00:23:21,00:23:23,if we can work out technologies to do that?
00:23:23,00:23:26,"I understand animals will die, obviously, but like."
00:23:26,00:23:27,- I think really the problem is stopping it
00:23:27,00:23:29,from entering the oceans in the first place.
00:23:29,00:23:30,- Yeah.
00:23:30,00:23:31,"- But I mean, I think once it gets to the coast,"
00:23:31,00:23:32,"to me, I mean, this is new research,"
00:23:32,00:23:35,but it seems like it would be easier to access
00:23:35,00:23:36,once it's not in the middle of nowhere.
00:23:36,00:23:37,It looks like it.
00:23:37,00:23:40,"So get to your beach, people, with a bucket and spade."
00:23:40,00:23:41,"- Yeah, nice."
00:23:41,00:23:43,- Have you guys heard of dark oxygen?
00:23:43,00:23:44,(laughing)
00:23:44,00:23:45,- Dark oxygen.
00:23:45,00:23:47,- Dark oxygen.
00:23:47,00:23:49,"- So by extension, it's, there's not as much oxygen"
00:23:49,00:23:50,as we thought there should be.
00:23:50,00:23:51,- Yeah.
00:23:51,00:23:53,- And some of it's missing.
00:23:53,00:23:55,- This is stuff that's found on the ocean floor.
00:23:55,00:23:56,- Yeah.
00:23:56,00:24:01,- And it's produced this dark oxygen by battery rocks.
00:24:01,00:24:02,- Okay.
00:24:02,00:24:04,"- These are the nodules, metallic nodules"
00:24:04,00:24:07,that are all over huge chunks of the ocean floor
00:24:07,00:24:12,"around the world, and they make oxygen without light."
00:24:12,00:24:13,They do it chemically.
00:24:13,00:24:15,So they split the water molecules around them
00:24:15,00:24:17,into hydrogen and oxygen.
00:24:17,00:24:18,So that's insane.
00:24:18,00:24:19,"I mean, that's the source of oxygen."
00:24:19,00:24:21,"- Yeah, it's like putting an electric,"
00:24:21,00:24:23,like we would make on a chemistry lesson.
00:24:23,00:24:24,- Electrolysis.
00:24:24,00:24:25,- It's crackers.
00:24:25,00:24:26,"Yeah, yeah."
00:24:26,00:24:28,- Are these connected to ocean farts?
00:24:28,00:24:29,- No.
00:24:29,00:24:30,(laughing)
00:24:30,00:24:32,- Walk in one of those in a minute.
00:24:32,00:24:35,- I just love the idea of having me doing a lecture
00:24:35,00:24:38,"and dancing on the front row with questions like,"
00:24:38,00:24:40,if you could put your hand down until we end up.
00:24:40,00:24:41,(laughing)
00:24:41,00:24:46,- We will have a question and answer session by in writing.
00:24:46,00:24:48,(laughing)
00:24:48,00:24:52,"- Go on, please go on."
00:24:52,00:24:55,- How can I possibly continue talking about something
00:24:55,00:24:59,"really interesting when you say, about ocean farts?"
00:24:59,00:25:00,And that's how the disruptive kids do it.
00:25:00,00:25:01,- Yeah.
00:25:01,00:25:03,This is why no one learns anything.
00:25:03,00:25:03,- Yeah.
00:25:03,00:25:04,- Yeah.
00:25:04,00:25:05,"No, it's just interesting"
00:25:05,00:25:07,'cause there's a huge debate at the moment.
00:25:07,00:25:08,I'm sure you're all keeping up with it
00:25:08,00:25:10,in the International Seabed Authority
00:25:10,00:25:12,about ocean mining the ocean floor.
00:25:12,00:25:14,Are we going to do it?
00:25:14,00:25:16,Should we definitely not do it?
00:25:16,00:25:17,And...
00:25:17,00:25:18,"- Well, the problem is,"
00:25:18,00:25:20,"one of the big problems is,"
00:25:20,00:25:21,"obviously logically you say we shouldn't do it,"
00:25:21,00:25:24,but it contains so much stuff like lithium
00:25:24,00:25:25,that you need.
00:25:25,00:25:26,"If everyone's gonna have an electric car,"
00:25:26,00:25:29,you need these minerals and where you're gonna get them from.
00:25:29,00:25:31,So it's like this weird sort of balance.
00:25:31,00:25:32,"- Do you get them from land,"
00:25:32,00:25:33,"which we know causes some damage,"
00:25:33,00:25:34,"do we get them from the ocean,"
00:25:34,00:25:37,where we really have no idea what effect it would have.
00:25:37,00:25:38,- It might be none.
00:25:38,00:25:40,- Might be absolutely fine.
00:25:40,00:25:43,"Why not just do it, assuming it'll be none."
00:25:43,00:25:44,"- That's really big, the ocean, isn't it?"
00:25:44,00:25:45,"- Oh, it's huge, yeah."
00:25:45,00:25:47,"So, but it is a really big debate at the moment."
00:25:47,00:25:48,"- So, wait, these batteries,"
00:25:48,00:25:51,"how are they, are we mining these big ocean floor batteries?"
00:25:51,00:25:53,- These are the nodules that people want to mine
00:25:53,00:25:55,because they contain these metals.
00:25:55,00:25:56,And so it's being debated at the moment.
00:25:56,00:25:58,"And it was found in a study,"
00:25:58,00:26:00,"which was funded by a mining firm,"
00:26:00,00:26:01,which is desperate to mine the ocean.
00:26:01,00:26:02,"And then it turned out,"
00:26:02,00:26:04,"oh, these might be a really important source of oxygen"
00:26:04,00:26:05,for all kinds of life.
00:26:05,00:26:06,And so they were furious
00:26:06,00:26:07,that they'd accidentally funded this study.
00:26:07,00:26:10,- One of the problem is that they are mostly found
00:26:10,00:26:12,in something that's called silicious ooze.
00:26:12,00:26:16,Silicious ooze is this kind of really low sediment
00:26:16,00:26:17,"at the bottom of the ocean,"
00:26:17,00:26:20,but it accumulates about one to three millimeters
00:26:20,00:26:22,every thousand years.
00:26:22,00:26:25,"So once you dig it up, it's going to take a while to get back."
00:26:25,00:26:28,"- Oh, 'cause we're probably going to dig faster than that."
00:26:28,00:26:30,"'Cause we dig faster than one to three millimeters, don't we?"
00:26:30,00:26:33,- My company is suggesting that we will do faster than that.
00:26:33,00:26:35,"- And I've invested, so."
00:26:35,00:26:36,- Interesting.
00:26:36,00:26:38,"- Well, there is one kind of ocean drilling, which is good."
00:26:38,00:26:40,And that's the scientific research kind.
00:26:40,00:26:43,And the first mission was really cool.
00:26:43,00:26:45,"It was in 1957, and it was organized"
00:26:45,00:26:49,by this group called the American Miscellaneous Society.
00:26:49,00:26:50,- I love them already.
00:26:50,00:26:51,- They are so cool.
00:26:51,00:26:53,They're like the ignobles of their time.
00:26:53,00:26:55,They were a bunch of geologists and oceanographers
00:26:55,00:26:58,who just wanted to get together and have weird ideas.
00:26:58,00:27:00,"Anyway, there was this thing called Project Moho,"
00:27:00,00:27:02,"which they started,"
00:27:02,00:27:06,which was to investigate the Mohorovich discontinuity.
00:27:06,00:27:08,"- It sounds sci-fi, doesn't it?"
00:27:08,00:27:09,- Yeah.
00:27:09,00:27:10,- The Mohorovich discontinuity
00:27:10,00:27:13,has been producing dark oxygen.
00:27:13,00:27:14,"- It does sound like someone who thought,"
00:27:14,00:27:16,I'm going to write it as a Russian name.
00:27:16,00:27:18,"And they go, no, no, that's not Russian enough."
00:27:18,00:27:20,Let's put another it to the end.
00:27:20,00:27:22,"There are too many O's and too many itches in it,"
00:27:22,00:27:24,"for me, to be honest."
00:27:24,00:27:26,But that's this bit between the crust of the Earth
00:27:26,00:27:27,"and the mantle,"
00:27:27,00:27:30,where suddenly seismic waves start moving much faster.
00:27:30,00:27:32,And it was the only reason we knew back then
00:27:32,00:27:34,that there was an Earth's crust.
00:27:34,00:27:36,"So these guys, the Miscellaneous Society,"
00:27:36,00:27:37,"were like, well, let's go and dig into the ocean"
00:27:37,00:27:39,and find out what's happening.
00:27:39,00:27:40,"It ended up being a failure,"
00:27:40,00:27:42,"but it started off this thing that happens today,"
00:27:42,00:27:44,a lot where we dig into the ocean floor
00:27:44,00:27:46,and pull up all these cores
00:27:46,00:27:47,and find out loads of cool stuff.
00:27:47,00:27:50,"And the person who came along with them to write about it,"
00:27:50,00:27:52,"and to report about it,"
00:27:52,00:27:56,"was oceanography fan and big lover of the sea,"
00:27:56,00:27:57,taking a guess.
00:27:57,00:27:58,- James Cameron.
00:27:58,00:28:00,"- Ah, he, I think in a former life,"
00:28:00,00:28:02,maybe this is who he was.
00:28:02,00:28:02,- Jack Cousteau.
00:28:02,00:28:03,- In '57.
00:28:03,00:28:04,"- Ooh, Jack Cousteau."
00:28:04,00:28:06,"- Yeah, no."
00:28:06,00:28:07,"Oh, I can give you a clue by saying,"
00:28:07,00:28:08,one of the lesser books he wrote
00:28:08,00:28:12,was called Steinbeck and Ricketts Sea of Cortez.
00:28:12,00:28:13,- So John Steinbeck.
00:28:13,00:28:14,- So it was John Steinbeck.
00:28:14,00:28:16,(all laughing)
00:28:18,00:28:21,- He absolutely loved the sea and oceanography.
00:28:21,00:28:22,- Really?
00:28:22,00:28:23,- So he hopped on board this research boat
00:28:23,00:28:24,and recourse for it.
00:28:24,00:28:25,- That's so good.
00:28:25,00:28:27,"Mentioning Jack Cousteau,"
00:28:27,00:28:30,the Calypso and his efforts of ocean mapping
00:28:30,00:28:32,are some of the greatest that we've ever had.
00:28:32,00:28:33,On his ship.
00:28:33,00:28:34,"- With the Calypso, his ship."
00:28:34,00:28:35,"- The Calypso was the ship,"
00:28:35,00:28:36,it was a very famous ship.
00:28:36,00:28:38,And he had three tanks
00:28:38,00:28:40,that would be there to take out to sea.
00:28:40,00:28:42,"So you had the diesel to run the ship,"
00:28:42,00:28:43,you had the water to drink.
00:28:43,00:28:45,What do you think his third tank was?
00:28:45,00:28:47,- Probably ocean farts.
00:28:47,00:28:48,"- Which he's bottled with, yes."
00:28:48,00:28:49,- Along the way?
00:28:49,00:28:50,- Thank you for reminding me.
00:28:50,00:28:52,We didn't pick up on my question.
00:28:52,00:28:55,- It's just like bilge water to keep him.
00:28:55,00:28:56,- Wastewater?
00:28:56,00:28:57,"- Yeah, wastewater."
00:28:57,00:28:58,- So it did not pollute the sea?
00:28:58,00:28:58,- No.
00:28:58,00:28:59,- Is it just whiskey or something?
00:28:59,00:29:00,- It's wine.
00:29:00,00:29:04,He had a giant wine tank attached to the ship
00:29:04,00:29:05,in order to.
00:29:05,00:29:06,- For drinking?
00:29:06,00:29:06,- Of course for drinking.
00:29:06,00:29:08,"- Right, not for some kind of fuel purpose."
00:29:08,00:29:10,- It's Jack Cousteau.
00:29:10,00:29:12,"He's gonna be, and his French buddies,"
00:29:12,00:29:14,drinking as they're...
00:29:14,00:29:15,- Amazing.
00:29:15,00:29:16,"- Have you guys heard of,"
00:29:16,00:29:19,while we're talking about weird rock formations?
00:29:19,00:29:22,Do you guys know about the Ararat Anomaly?
00:29:22,00:29:24,- So Mount Ararat?
00:29:24,00:29:26,"- Mount Ararat, yes."
00:29:26,00:29:27,- Above land?
00:29:27,00:29:28,- It's above land.
00:29:28,00:29:29,"- Oh, is it that there are loads of fossils"
00:29:29,00:29:32,that should be ocean things on Mount Ararat?
00:29:32,00:29:35,"- There are those, but that's not what this is."
00:29:35,00:29:37,This is if people have taken photos
00:29:37,00:29:39,"of the snow near the summit of Mount Ararat,"
00:29:39,00:29:43,there's something that looks very much like Noah's Ark.
00:29:43,00:29:43,- Brilliant.
00:29:43,00:29:45,"- And if you see the pictures,"
00:29:45,00:29:46,you can kind of see where they're coming from.
00:29:46,00:29:47,"I mean, they're very fuzzy."
00:29:47,00:29:48,"But the interesting thing is,"
00:29:48,00:29:52,this was classified as secret for the U.S. Air Force
00:29:52,00:29:56,from 1949 until the '90s.
00:29:56,00:29:57,- Wow.
00:29:57,00:29:59,"- And it's in snow, it's like a snow arc."
00:29:59,00:30:03,"- It's kind of, it's basically just a jagged bit of rock."
00:30:03,00:30:04,"- A snow, it's an arc shaped pile of rocks."
00:30:04,00:30:06,"- Precisely, okay."
00:30:06,00:30:08,"Yeah, why do you think it was classified as secret"
00:30:08,00:30:10,for so long?
00:30:10,00:30:12,- Because it might provoke religious conflict.
00:30:12,00:30:14,"- Interesting, because obviously,"
00:30:14,00:30:16,"a lot of believers think that this is evidence,"
00:30:16,00:30:19,"that the Bible is true, but no, that wasn't it."
00:30:19,00:30:20,- Okay.
00:30:20,00:30:23,"- It's much more Cotidian, much more boring than that."
00:30:23,00:30:25,- People might visit if they didn't want to visit.
00:30:25,00:30:29,"- Basically, it's on the border of the Soviet Union."
00:30:29,00:30:32,And so there was lots of things happening around there
00:30:32,00:30:34,"between America and the Soviet Union,"
00:30:34,00:30:36,so they didn't want any photos coming out.
00:30:36,00:30:40,"But obviously the conspiracy theorists were like,"
00:30:40,00:30:41,"oh, what are you hiding?"
00:30:41,00:30:41,What are you hiding?
00:30:41,00:30:43,"- Yeah, Noah's Ark."
00:30:43,00:30:46,"- Noah's in there, you're keeping him prisoner."
00:30:46,00:30:48,"- I've got one last thing, it's very silly,"
00:30:48,00:30:50,but I was looking into people
00:30:50,00:30:52,and how they managed to survive the ocean
00:30:52,00:30:55,once they'd been lost and people are out looking for them.
00:30:55,00:30:58,"So there was a group of people, eight men and seven women,"
00:30:58,00:31:01,and they were stuck out on a sort of life raft situation.
00:31:01,00:31:03,No one there to save them.
00:31:03,00:31:06,"They have no water, how do they survive?"
00:31:06,00:31:06,And they managed 12 days.
00:31:06,00:31:08,- Huge barrel of wide floats up.
00:31:08,00:31:11,How long did they manage?
00:31:11,00:31:13,- I think they were out there for 12 days.
00:31:13,00:31:15,"- Like drinking turtle blood, that is not okay."
00:31:15,00:31:16,"- So we're in that territory,"
00:31:16,00:31:18,they've got to find a source of food.
00:31:18,00:31:20,- Drinking the little bit of liquid you get
00:31:20,00:31:23,"in a fish's eye, we've said that before."
00:31:23,00:31:26,- We covered turtle blood enemas in the past.
00:31:26,00:31:28,"- Yeah, turtle blood enemas."
00:31:28,00:31:30,- They were on a journey to Puerto Rico.
00:31:30,00:31:35,So one of the people on the boat was Faustina Mercedes.
00:31:35,00:31:37,"She had back at home a one-year-old daughter,"
00:31:37,00:31:40,which meant she was still lactating.
00:31:40,00:31:42,She was lactating.
00:31:42,00:31:46,And so she offered up her breasts to everyone on the boat.
00:31:46,00:31:47,And every day.
00:31:47,00:31:48,- How many people were on the boat?
00:31:48,00:31:49,"- There were a lot, there were eight men."
00:31:49,00:31:50,- It was a cruise ship.
00:31:50,00:31:51,(all laughing)
00:31:51,00:31:52,"- 2,000 people."
00:31:52,00:31:53,"- Oh, Lord."
00:31:53,00:31:54,- Killing up every day.
00:31:54,00:31:55,(all laughing)
00:31:55,00:31:57,"- Eight men, seven women."
00:31:57,00:32:00,"Every day they would take a quick couple of sips,"
00:32:00,00:32:02,and then that was just keeping them at bay.
00:32:02,00:32:04,"And in order to feed herself,"
00:32:04,00:32:06,her sister would go on the breast
00:32:06,00:32:08,and then pass the milk back to her.
00:32:08,00:32:09,"- Oh, clever."
00:32:09,00:32:10,- Yeah.
00:32:10,00:32:11,"- Wait, does that keep her going?"
00:32:11,00:32:14,"Does that, it feels like that doesn't make any sense."
00:32:14,00:32:15,It doesn't make any sense.
00:32:15,00:32:17,"I know many people have pointed this out,"
00:32:17,00:32:17,but it's-
00:32:17,00:32:19,- We're not producing milk out of nowhere.
00:32:19,00:32:21,"- But it deals with your dry mouth, you know?"
00:32:21,00:32:22,"- It's basically,"
00:32:22,00:32:24,"they're very, very slowly cannibalizing this woman."
00:32:24,00:32:25,- Yes.
00:32:25,00:32:26,- Yeah.
00:32:26,00:32:27,- Yeah.
00:32:27,00:32:28,- And our motherhood-
00:32:28,00:32:29,"- She must have been quite saggy by the end,"
00:32:29,00:32:30,was she?
00:32:30,00:32:31,"- When she got back,"
00:32:31,00:32:33,she said she was unable to feed her own child
00:32:33,00:32:35,"because of the, it was pretty traumatic."
00:32:35,00:32:36,It was pretty weird.
00:32:36,00:32:37,- It was highly unsurprising.
00:32:37,00:32:37,"- She said it was weird, yeah."
00:32:37,00:32:38,- Well.
00:32:38,00:32:40,"- That's, that is weird."
00:32:40,00:32:40,- It is weird.
00:32:40,00:32:42,- I'm with her on that one.
00:32:42,00:32:44,"- It's also, it's also the ending of,"
00:32:44,00:32:45,"loop it right around,"
00:32:45,00:32:46,"""The Grapes of Roth""."
00:32:46,00:32:49,(all laughing)
00:32:49,00:32:51,"- It is, ""The Grapes of Roth"" ends with a lady-"
00:32:51,00:32:52,"- Yeah, we're suckling on it."
00:32:52,00:32:53,- It ends with a young lady suckling an old man
00:32:53,00:32:54,who's starving to death.
00:32:54,00:32:56,It's the Dust Bowl America.
00:32:56,00:32:57,"It's, that is the final seat."
00:32:57,00:32:58,- That's not right.
00:32:58,00:32:58,- That's the final seat.
00:32:58,00:32:59,- That's an incredible full circle.
00:32:59,00:33:02,"I am only a hundred pages into ""The Grapes of Roth"","
00:33:02,00:33:03,"10 years ago, fine, I never got any."
00:33:03,00:33:06,(all laughing)
00:33:06,00:33:08,(upbeat music)
00:33:08,00:33:13,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:33:13,00:33:15,and that is my fact.
00:33:15,00:33:17,My fact this week is that when the Forbidden City in China
00:33:17,00:33:20,"had its first telephone installed,"
00:33:20,00:33:25,it was first used by the emperor to make prank phone calls.
00:33:25,00:33:28,This was the last emperor of China known as Puyi.
00:33:28,00:33:30,"And after having the phone installed,"
00:33:30,00:33:32,he went through a phone book.
00:33:32,00:33:34,"He found one of his favorite opera singers,"
00:33:34,00:33:35,a guy called Yang Xiaolu.
00:33:35,00:33:37,"And he called him up and he said,"
00:33:37,00:33:39,"""Is this the great operatic singer?"""
00:33:39,00:33:39,"And he said, ""Yes."""
00:33:39,00:33:41,And then he just giggled and hung up.
00:33:41,00:33:43,- He hadn't developed the pranks by that point.
00:33:43,00:33:45,"- No, that's not Bart Simpson level."
00:33:45,00:33:48,"- No, the second one is closer to sort of teenage pranking."
00:33:48,00:33:50,He would call up local restaurants
00:33:50,00:33:52,and he would order a bunch of food to an address
00:33:52,00:33:54,"that wasn't brilliant, the Forbidden City."
00:33:54,00:33:57,- And so here's a question.
00:33:57,00:33:59,It sounds like everyone in the country
00:33:59,00:34:01,had telephones apart from him.
00:34:01,00:34:02,"- Yeah, possibly."
00:34:02,00:34:03,"I mean, well, they, you know,"
00:34:03,00:34:05,the emperor was kind of isolated from the rest of the world.
00:34:05,00:34:07,"They were sort of, no one was really allowed"
00:34:07,00:34:09,into the Forbidden City who weren't part of the system.
00:34:09,00:34:11,"- Okay, you should probably explain who he was then."
00:34:11,00:34:12,"- Well, yes."
00:34:12,00:34:15,"So he was the, he was no longer really the emperor"
00:34:15,00:34:18,by the time we were talking about when he was a teenager.
00:34:18,00:34:19,So he was born in 1906.
00:34:19,00:34:21,He became the emperor in 1908.
00:34:21,00:34:23,And he was deposed in 1911
00:34:23,00:34:25,"because he, you know, he did such a terrible job."
00:34:25,00:34:27,"- Yeah, they screwed him up."
00:34:27,00:34:29,- He thrown his ties out of the pram or something.
00:34:29,00:34:31,- It was like having Boris Johnson in charge over there.
00:34:31,00:34:35,"- Yeah, so he, but he was allowed to stay in a palace"
00:34:35,00:34:38,"and keep living as though he were the supreme authority,"
00:34:38,00:34:39,even though he wasn't.
00:34:39,00:34:41,So it's really strange.
00:34:41,00:34:42,"- Well, he's a figurehead, wasn't he?"
00:34:42,00:34:44,"- That is a bit like Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings,"
00:34:44,00:34:45,isn't it?
00:34:45,00:34:46,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:34:46,00:34:46,- It's exactly that.
00:34:46,00:34:47,- I'll let you stay.
00:34:47,00:34:49,"- But when he asked for his phone in the first place,"
00:34:49,00:34:52,he was told there is nothing in the ancestral regulations
00:34:52,00:34:53,to provide for this.
00:34:53,00:34:55,"Because obviously his ancestors had been saying,"
00:34:55,00:34:56,"""Oh, I gotta have a phone."""
00:34:56,00:34:57,- He wouldn't predict these things.
00:34:57,00:34:59,"- It was a really weird, the old fashion,"
00:34:59,00:35:01,and his father said it would upset imperial dignity
00:35:01,00:35:04,if outside voices could ring into the palace.
00:35:04,00:35:06,So there was controversy about it at the time.
00:35:06,00:35:06,"- There were, absolutely."
00:35:06,00:35:09,"And this was, he only really knew about the phones"
00:35:09,00:35:11,"because he had a British tutor,"
00:35:11,00:35:13,who was a guy called Sir Reginald Fleming Johnston.
00:35:13,00:35:15,"Not a sir at the time, I don't think,"
00:35:15,00:35:20,but he became the English tutor to Puyi.
00:35:20,00:35:22,And he was the one who mentioned it.
00:35:22,00:35:23,"He was, ""Oh, you've got these things called phones."""
00:35:23,00:35:25,"And he said, ""I love one."""
00:35:25,00:35:28,- Johnson got pranked all the time by Puyi.
00:35:28,00:35:30,Puyi was constantly bringing up the man who'd got in the phone.
00:35:30,00:35:33,"- That's a, 'cause kind of he was his only friend,"
00:35:33,00:35:34,I got the impression.
00:35:34,00:35:35,So that's kind of sad.
00:35:35,00:35:37,And I'm sure Johnston pretends to be really upset
00:35:37,00:35:38,or amused every time.
00:35:38,00:35:39,- I think what we're gonna find
00:35:39,00:35:42,"is that this is a pretty tragic story, isn't it?"
00:35:42,00:35:45,"This guy, very young, made an emperor,"
00:35:45,00:35:47,"turned out to be a utter, utter asshole,"
00:35:47,00:35:49,but probably a victim of circumstance
00:35:49,00:35:51,because he was left on his own the whole time.
00:35:51,00:35:53,"- That's the thing, the whole thing feeds on itself."
00:35:53,00:35:55,It's like no one comes out good in this story.
00:35:55,00:35:57,I just want to stick up for Puyi.
00:35:57,00:35:58,- Oh yeah.
00:35:58,00:35:59,- Because I've got this book out of the library.
00:35:59,00:36:00,- Yep.
00:36:00,00:36:02,- It's from Emperor to Citizen.
00:36:02,00:36:03,- Oh yes.
00:36:03,00:36:04,- And it's his memoir.
00:36:04,00:36:05,- Oh yeah.
00:36:05,00:36:06,- And I've been reading it.
00:36:06,00:36:08,"And he, you know, it's actually a lot funnier"
00:36:08,00:36:10,than we're all giving it credit for.
00:36:10,00:36:11,- Does he mention all the stuff
00:36:11,00:36:13,about constantly whipping eunuchs
00:36:13,00:36:15,just for the sake of having fun of watching that?
00:36:15,00:36:16,- He does.
00:36:16,00:36:17,- He beats them to death.
00:36:17,00:36:18,Did he do that?
00:36:18,00:36:19,- Does he mention it when his wife
00:36:19,00:36:20,had a child with another man
00:36:20,00:36:22,and then he had that baby stolen and killed?
00:36:22,00:36:23,Is that in there?
00:36:23,00:36:24,Is that part of the funny stuff?
00:36:24,00:36:25,"- Okay, I haven't read the whole thing."
00:36:25,00:36:26,- Yeah.
00:36:26,00:36:26,He's a bad dude.
00:36:26,00:36:28,"- No, he does mention the eunuch stuff though"
00:36:28,00:36:30,because that was his whole big repentance thing.
00:36:30,00:36:32,His memoirs at the end of his life
00:36:32,00:36:34,"was when he said, ""I'm sorry for all this."""
00:36:34,00:36:37,- There's an entire chapter called the eunuchs
00:36:37,00:36:40,because he lived surrounded by eunuchs.
00:36:40,00:36:41,- Yeah.
00:36:41,00:36:42,- There were a few hundred
00:36:42,00:36:43,and even that was a substantial cut down
00:36:43,00:36:44,from the glory days when there were--
00:36:44,00:36:47,- Substantial cut down to make those eunuchs.
00:36:47,00:36:48,"- In the good old days,"
00:36:48,00:36:49,there were thousands and thousands of you.
00:36:49,00:36:52,"Look, just look, eunuchs, page 61,"
00:36:52,00:36:54,"just a great section on, you know,"
00:36:54,00:36:55,the eunuchy life he lived.
00:36:55,00:36:56,- That's pretty funny.
00:36:56,00:36:57,"- Until he was 10 years old,"
00:36:57,00:36:59,he only played hide and seek with his own eunuchs.
00:36:59,00:37:00,He was very isolated growing up.
00:37:00,00:37:01,"I mean, he had siblings,"
00:37:01,00:37:04,but he didn't see his own mother for years and years and years
00:37:04,00:37:05,'cause he was taken away to live in the--
00:37:05,00:37:08,- He wasn't the child of the previous emperor.
00:37:08,00:37:09,The previous emperor was his uncle.
00:37:09,00:37:10,- That's right.
00:37:10,00:37:10,"So there was the emperor Stowager,"
00:37:10,00:37:13,who's a very famous character in ancient Chinese--
00:37:13,00:37:15,"- Yeah, Sushi, who's this amazing person."
00:37:15,00:37:18,"- And she, when the emperor had passed away,"
00:37:18,00:37:20,there was no child in order to take over.
00:37:20,00:37:22,So this was the nephew.
00:37:22,00:37:24,- But there were moments of levity in his childhood.
00:37:24,00:37:26,I just think there were a few.
00:37:26,00:37:28,"So just get this, if you ever went to the park,"
00:37:28,00:37:30,this is the process of how it would happen.
00:37:30,00:37:32,"He would have a eunuch walking ahead of him,"
00:37:32,00:37:33,"basically honking with his mouth to say,"
00:37:33,00:37:35,"""Everyone keep away."""
00:37:35,00:37:38,"He was like a sort of one-man beep, beep, beep system."
00:37:38,00:37:41,"- Well, they hadn't invented the klaxon horn,"
00:37:41,00:37:42,"had they ever done yet? - No, yeah, no."
00:37:42,00:37:43,- So you needed the eunuch.
00:37:43,00:37:45,"- A rare example of China not inventing something first,"
00:37:45,00:37:48,just 'cause the eunuch system works so well.
00:37:48,00:37:49,Then there would be two chief eunuchs
00:37:49,00:37:51,"going kind of crab-wise sideways,"
00:37:51,00:37:52,just keeping an eye on everything.
00:37:52,00:37:55,Then there would be junior eunuchs with him.
00:37:55,00:37:56,"There would be a eunuch with a canopy,"
00:37:56,00:37:59,"then more eunuchs holding a chair, a change of clothes,"
00:37:59,00:38:00,"some umbrellas, some cakes,"
00:38:00,00:38:01,some hot water.
00:38:01,00:38:04,Then there were the medical eunuchs who came behind them.
00:38:04,00:38:06,- We've all been to the beach with our kids.
00:38:06,00:38:08,"We know how much you have to take,"
00:38:08,00:38:09,how many eunuchs you need.
00:38:09,00:38:13,"- And then at the end is the eunuch with the Lou,"
00:38:13,00:38:15,"or the eunuchs, several eunuchs"
00:38:15,00:38:17,with commodes and chamber pots and things.
00:38:17,00:38:18,"And when he was a kid, he would just run around."
00:38:18,00:38:20,And it's called absolute mayhem
00:38:20,00:38:21,because the whole procession was trying to keep up
00:38:21,00:38:23,with a five-year-old boy
00:38:23,00:38:24,who was just running around in a park.
00:38:24,00:38:26,- Can I do it an incredibly quick?
00:38:26,00:38:27,This is his life.
00:38:27,00:38:30,"So on the throne at two, kicked off the throne at six,"
00:38:30,00:38:35,"but got to be pretend emperor until like early mid 1920s,"
00:38:35,00:38:37,"at which point he was booted out by a warlord,"
00:38:37,00:38:39,"hung up being a playboy who used to be the emperor,"
00:38:39,00:38:41,shagging around a bit.
00:38:41,00:38:44,"Until 1931, Japan invaded Manchuria,"
00:38:44,00:38:46,"thought we'll pluck this former emperor,"
00:38:46,00:38:49,"put him in charge apparently, but he's our puppet."
00:38:49,00:38:50,"He had no power,"
00:38:50,00:38:53,but he got to keep living this weird fake royal life.
00:38:53,00:38:56,"So continued being pampered and petted,"
00:38:56,00:38:57,having people wait on him.
00:38:57,00:38:58,No power.
00:38:58,00:39:02,"Then Japanese surrender 1945, he's fucked"
00:39:02,00:39:03,"because the Soviets come,"
00:39:03,00:39:05,they put him in prison for five years.
00:39:05,00:39:07,Then they hand him over to the Chinese who reeducate him.
00:39:07,00:39:09,- The communists at this point.
00:39:09,00:39:10,"- Who are communists, reeducate him."
00:39:10,00:39:12,"He comes out, bona fide communists"
00:39:12,00:39:13,and ends his life for Gardner.
00:39:13,00:39:15,Mad life.
00:39:15,00:39:15,- It is a mad life.
00:39:15,00:39:19,"And reeducation is like being in a jail cell, right?"
00:39:19,00:39:19,Like it's your-
00:39:19,00:39:20,"- It's like going out to school, Dan."
00:39:20,00:39:21,- You're being conditioned.
00:39:21,00:39:24,"Yeah, it's like a British boarding school."
00:39:24,00:39:26,Maybe that's why I think all this sounds absolutely
00:39:26,00:39:27,part of the course.
00:39:27,00:39:28,(all laughing)
00:39:28,00:39:30,We were constantly firing air guns at the Unix
00:39:30,00:39:30,at my school.
00:39:30,00:39:33,(all laughing)
00:39:33,00:39:36,"- And the final bit of life where he became a Gardner,"
00:39:36,00:39:39,he's fascinating just reading how useless he was
00:39:39,00:39:41,"in day-to-day activities,"
00:39:41,00:39:43,where he would sort of forget to flush a toilet
00:39:43,00:39:47,or know any directions or all these basic things
00:39:47,00:39:47,that you would-
00:39:47,00:39:48,- Shoelaces.
00:39:48,00:39:49,"- Yeah, shoelaces."
00:39:49,00:39:50,- Just done his shoes for his whole life.
00:39:50,00:39:52,"- I found it, I really question this,"
00:39:52,00:39:54,"but I mean, all the historians say it,"
00:39:54,00:39:56,"that when he was being reeducated by China,"
00:39:56,00:39:58,it was partly to say be a communist
00:39:58,00:40:00,and apologize for uniting with the Japanese.
00:40:00,00:40:01,"And it was partly to say,"
00:40:01,00:40:02,"""Here's how to look after yourself."""
00:40:02,00:40:04,And they taught him to tie his shoelaces
00:40:04,00:40:05,and brush his teeth.
00:40:05,00:40:08,- He was breastfed until the age of eight.
00:40:08,00:40:08,- Yep.
00:40:08,00:40:09,"- And at that point, the Dowager,"
00:40:09,00:40:11,"the powerful Dowager said,"
00:40:11,00:40:14,"""I think it's probably time we've removed your wet nurse"
00:40:14,00:40:15,"from you."""
00:40:15,00:40:16,"Which made him very sad,"
00:40:16,00:40:18,'cause he would just believe we're still enjoying it.
00:40:18,00:40:20,"- But he was stranded out in the Pacific at the time,"
00:40:20,00:40:20,wasn't he?
00:40:20,00:40:21,(all laughing)
00:40:21,00:40:22,He had no other sustenance.
00:40:22,00:40:25,- If you were the Empress Dowager
00:40:25,00:40:28,"in this weird fake palace situation,"
00:40:28,00:40:29,was it real palace?
00:40:29,00:40:31,"- First of all, what is an Empress Dowager?"
00:40:31,00:40:34,"- So she's the widow of the emperor,"
00:40:34,00:40:36,"who is now in a senior position,"
00:40:36,00:40:38,kind of like a regent.
00:40:38,00:40:39,"She's got a lot of authority,"
00:40:39,00:40:40,but she's not technically--
00:40:40,00:40:42,- So she basically runs everything.
00:40:42,00:40:43,- Exactly.
00:40:43,00:40:46,- But she's putting in little puppets to do her work for her.
00:40:46,00:40:48,"'Cause arguably this guy,"
00:40:48,00:40:49,"even though he was emperor three times,"
00:40:49,00:40:51,he was never really in charge at any stage.
00:40:51,00:40:52,"- Absolutely, absolutely."
00:40:52,00:40:53,He just wasn't in charge.
00:40:53,00:40:55,"So yeah, the Dowager would have been the one"
00:40:55,00:40:56,"really controlling things,"
00:40:56,00:40:58,"saying, ""I think maybe we should stop breastfeeding you now,"""
00:40:58,00:40:59,that kind of thing.
00:40:59,00:41:02,"- Or more like, ""I think maybe we should invade Mongolia now."""
00:41:02,00:41:03,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:41:03,00:41:06,(all laughing)
00:41:06,00:41:08,"They had this thing in the palace,"
00:41:08,00:41:10,"and again, this is after the First Revolution."
00:41:10,00:41:11,"So they're not really in charge anymore,"
00:41:11,00:41:13,but they're still treated with a lot of respect.
00:41:13,00:41:15,"There was an as you wish lodge,"
00:41:15,00:41:17,which was one of the 48 offices
00:41:17,00:41:18,that the staff were working in.
00:41:18,00:41:21,"And if the Empress Dowager decided to do some painting,"
00:41:21,00:41:26,the staff at the lodge would make her the painting already.
00:41:26,00:41:28,"They basically made her a paint by numbers,"
00:41:28,00:41:29,and she just had to fill in the colors
00:41:29,00:41:30,and put the title on it.
00:41:30,00:41:31,- That's great.
00:41:31,00:41:32,- What a great service.
00:41:32,00:41:32,- How cool is that?
00:41:32,00:41:34,"- Wow, I want that."
00:41:34,00:41:36,"He married five times,"
00:41:36,00:41:37,which was easier to fit in
00:41:37,00:41:39,"when you're allowed multiple marriages at once,"
00:41:39,00:41:40,as you were.
00:41:40,00:41:43,"But again, this seemed like an unfair trick."
00:41:43,00:41:44,This is in 1921.
00:41:44,00:41:48,"So when he was being like pretend emperor with no power,"
00:41:48,00:41:51,he was shown five photos of women.
00:41:51,00:41:53,It used to be that the emperor had women paraded
00:41:53,00:41:55,"in front of him and got to choose,"
00:41:55,00:41:58,"but because he's been downgraded, he just got photos."
00:41:58,00:42:00,"And he was asked, ""Choose who you like best."""
00:42:00,00:42:01,He picked one.
00:42:01,00:42:03,And then they chatted amongst themselves.
00:42:03,00:42:04,"The other people at court went,"
00:42:04,00:42:05,"""No, she's not fit enough."""
00:42:05,00:42:06,- No.
00:42:06,00:42:08,- And they made him marry the other one.
00:42:08,00:42:10,"- So he did get a second wife from a different photo,"
00:42:10,00:42:11,"but on the day of marriage,"
00:42:11,00:42:14,he then also married this first choice.
00:42:14,00:42:14,- Yes.
00:42:14,00:42:15,- He had two marriages on the same day.
00:42:15,00:42:16,- On the same day.
00:42:16,00:42:18,"- That's a sitcom, ready to be written, isn't it?"
00:42:18,00:42:19,(laughing)
00:42:19,00:42:22,"- You know what, it sounds so unfunny their lives."
00:42:22,00:42:24,"I want you to inject some gags in there, please."
00:42:24,00:42:25,- If anyone has any objection
00:42:25,00:42:27,and you're hoping the concubine hasn't turned up
00:42:27,00:42:29,"to your wedding, or your wife hasn't turned up"
00:42:29,00:42:31,"for the concubine marriage, I think this is good."
00:42:31,00:42:32,- They were really young weren't they?
00:42:32,00:42:34,These young women who were brought in.
00:42:34,00:42:37,The last one who was called Li Yuqin.
00:42:37,00:42:40,"She was, I think she was 14 or something"
00:42:40,00:42:43,when she became the last imperial consort
00:42:43,00:42:48,and the emperor was comparatively old at this stage.
00:42:48,00:42:50,"But she said, and in his view she said"
00:42:50,00:42:53,she didn't even know how children were made at that stage.
00:42:53,00:42:56,She believed what she was told by her mother
00:42:56,00:42:59,that we were picked up from the rubbish bins.
00:42:59,00:43:01,I just think that's an unusual way of telling kids
00:43:01,00:43:03,that that's where babies come from.
00:43:03,00:43:06,"- It's good parenting, and it's a story I've maintained."
00:43:06,00:43:08,"- Well, I just think, 'cause we have like the stock"
00:43:08,00:43:09,comes and drops the baby at the front door.
00:43:09,00:43:10,- That's very nice.
00:43:10,00:43:12,"Cabbage patch is nice, fertility and growth."
00:43:12,00:43:13,- But rubbish bins?
00:43:13,00:43:14,"- Yeah, to be fair,"
00:43:14,00:43:16,this is an almost entirely unique based society.
00:43:16,00:43:17,It's very hard to actually get a handle
00:43:17,00:43:21,on where children come from in this world.
00:43:21,00:43:22,But he doesn't seem to have been
00:43:22,00:43:24,especially actually interested in women now.
00:43:24,00:43:26,"- Well, he used to have blazing rounds with his wife,"
00:43:26,00:43:28,"both wives and all five wives about,"
00:43:28,00:43:30,they would sometimes refer to him as a eunuch
00:43:30,00:43:32,because of his lack of prowess.
00:43:32,00:43:35,"In the bedroom on the honeymoon night,"
00:43:35,00:43:36,"he had both of his first wives,"
00:43:36,00:43:38,"so the wife and the consort in the same bed,"
00:43:38,00:43:39,waiting for him.
00:43:39,00:43:41,"And when he went in, the story goes,"
00:43:41,00:43:43,he ran out of the room and they don't know
00:43:43,00:43:45,"if there was much, with any consummation happening."
00:43:45,00:43:48,"- I'm hearing sitcom, I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
00:43:48,00:43:50,"- They're running in and running out,"
00:43:50,00:43:53,certainly out of the element of farce.
00:43:53,00:43:55,His last wife seemed like quite a sweet story.
00:43:55,00:43:59,So this was in the 1960s.
00:43:59,00:44:00,He started off working as a street sweeper.
00:44:00,00:44:03,"So the Chinese reeducated him, then pardoned him."
00:44:03,00:44:06,He became a street sweeper and there's a very sad story
00:44:06,00:44:09,of him getting lost and he has to approach his former subjects
00:44:09,00:44:11,"and say, ""Hello, I used to be the emperor."
00:44:11,00:44:12,I don't know how to get home.
00:44:12,00:44:13,"I'm staying with family."""
00:44:13,00:44:15,- He should just follow the clean streets.
00:44:15,00:44:17,If he goes back in the direction
00:44:17,00:44:18,"that all the clean streets are,"
00:44:18,00:44:19,he knows that's where he came from.
00:44:19,00:44:21,"- The thing is James, he was so bad at all these tasks."
00:44:21,00:44:23,He hadn't actually effectively cleaned the streets.
00:44:23,00:44:26,- I think it's like the reverse of following the breadcrumbs.
00:44:26,00:44:28,- Yeah. - That's beautiful.
00:44:28,00:44:30,- Follow the lack of breadcrumbs.
00:44:30,00:44:33,But then he married this woman who was a nurse
00:44:33,00:44:35,and they stayed together forever.
00:44:35,00:44:37,And I think she didn't die until 1997.
00:44:37,00:44:40,And she said he was just desperate for someone to love him.
00:44:40,00:44:41,Which after that life?
00:44:41,00:44:42,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:44:42,00:44:43,"- Yeah, it's wild."
00:44:43,00:44:45,"- So you find the story very depressing Dan,"
00:44:45,00:44:46,which is fair. - Yeah.
00:44:46,00:44:49,"- But actually, when he did write his memoirs at the end,"
00:44:49,00:44:51,which were heavily influenced
00:44:51,00:44:53,"by the Chinese Communist Party and its free education,"
00:44:53,00:44:54,he did say he was-
00:44:54,00:44:55,- They come in for some very good press
00:44:55,00:44:57,"at the end of this one, I've gotta say."
00:44:57,00:44:57,- Exactly.
00:44:57,00:45:01,He was at least contented with his current status
00:45:01,00:45:05,as a repentant and devoted communist who loved the party.
00:45:05,00:45:08,"- I didn't notice, Addy, that it is a little red book."
00:45:08,00:45:09,(all laughing)
00:45:09,00:45:10,- Yes it is.
00:45:10,00:45:13,(upbeat music)
00:45:13,00:45:16,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show"
00:45:16,00:45:17,and that is Andy.
00:45:17,00:45:19,"- My fact is that the film ""Spider-Man"""
00:45:19,00:45:22,"once cast two crowds of identical twin extras,"
00:45:22,00:45:24,so they could film the same scene at the same time
00:45:24,00:45:26,in different places.
00:45:26,00:45:27,- Amazing. - That's amazing.
00:45:27,00:45:27,- Why?
00:45:27,00:45:29,"You know, the first thing that comes into my head"
00:45:29,00:45:32,is that meme of all the Spider-Man points at each other.
00:45:32,00:45:33,- Yeah.
00:45:33,00:45:34,(all laughing)
00:45:34,00:45:37,- This is a really weird thing that just happened to happen
00:45:37,00:45:39,once in the annals of filming history.
00:45:39,00:45:41,And I got this because I was looking in the mirror
00:45:41,00:45:42,in history and I got this because I was looking
00:45:42,00:45:45,into casting and how people are cast
00:45:45,00:45:47,and how extras get cast in films.
00:45:47,00:45:49,And there was a woman called Jennifer Bender
00:45:49,00:45:52,who was the vice president of an extras film
00:45:52,00:45:54,about 10 years ago and she was being in due
00:45:54,00:45:55,to develop a business.
00:45:55,00:45:59,"And she said that this film, they had two units shooting."
00:45:59,00:46:00,"You know, you have-- - Sorry, two eunuchs."
00:46:00,00:46:03,(all laughing)
00:46:03,00:46:05,- There's a main unit and a second unit.
00:46:05,00:46:09,"And they needed, yeah, due to just the nature of film."
00:46:09,00:46:10,"It's so weird when you ask anyone about the world of film,"
00:46:10,00:46:13,why their stuff is so weird.
00:46:13,00:46:14,"They just say, ""Well, that's just filming, isn't it?"""
00:46:14,00:46:17,"And it's basically, they had to shoot this scene"
00:46:17,00:46:19,in two places at the same time
00:46:19,00:46:21,because of the schedule they were on to get this filmed.
00:46:21,00:46:23,"So they said, ""Well, let's just cast twins."""
00:46:23,00:46:26,"So they got 25 sets of twins, so one lot to one set,"
00:46:26,00:46:28,"so one lot to the other set, dressed them the same."
00:46:28,00:46:28,- That's really good.
00:46:28,00:46:29,- That's really cool.
00:46:29,00:46:31,"- And one of the thing is that the twins,"
00:46:31,00:46:34,"they can telepathically communicate to each other, right?"
00:46:34,00:46:37,So they can tell them what's happening in the other place.
00:46:37,00:46:39,"- So when he said this fact, so we were like,"
00:46:39,00:46:42,"""Wow, why?"" and you said, ""You'll have to wait and see."""
00:46:42,00:46:43,"But what the answer is just,"
00:46:43,00:46:45,'cause they're really shit at making film schedules.
00:46:45,00:46:47,"- Schedules, it's just, you know."
00:46:47,00:46:49,- I'm sure it's easier to repack the schedule.
00:46:49,00:46:53,"- I've got to say, Andy's sort of amazing mystery"
00:46:53,00:46:56,"is always going to end up, it was a matter of scheduling."
00:46:56,00:46:58,(laughing)
00:46:58,00:47:00,"- Anna, you don't understand the nature of film."
00:47:00,00:47:02,"Like, there are producers on your ass all the time saying,"
00:47:02,00:47:03,"""We've got to get this ready"
00:47:03,00:47:06,"""for the Hong Kong market in two weeks,"" you know?"
00:47:06,00:47:07,- Can't have that many identical twins in the world.
00:47:07,00:47:08,- We've got to do the re-shoots.
00:47:08,00:47:10,Get Chalamet now.
00:47:10,00:47:13,I want five Chalamets on my desk tomorrow morning.
00:47:13,00:47:16,"You know, it's hard, that's film."
00:47:16,00:47:17,"- Incredible, so good."
00:47:17,00:47:18,- That's really cool.
00:47:18,00:47:20,- It's hard to be an extra.
00:47:20,00:47:21,"- Oh, it sounds it."
00:47:21,00:47:23,I've done extra work a couple of times.
00:47:23,00:47:23,- Have you?
00:47:23,00:47:24,- Yeah.
00:47:24,00:47:25,"- Well, in this podcast."
00:47:25,00:47:26,- Wow.
00:47:26,00:47:27,(laughing)
00:47:27,00:47:28,- What did you do?
00:47:28,00:47:29,- I can't remember.
00:47:29,00:47:31,"It was a film with James McAvoy, which was quite exciting."
00:47:31,00:47:33,'Cause you often don't know before you turn up
00:47:33,00:47:34,what it's going to be.
00:47:34,00:47:34,"- Yeah, right."
00:47:34,00:47:36,- Are they looking specifically for people
00:47:36,00:47:40,with quite normal-looking faces?
00:47:40,00:47:42,"- Planned, ideally, they want balloons on sticks."
00:47:42,00:47:43,"- Well, that is a thing, isn't it?"
00:47:43,00:47:44,- Yeah.
00:47:44,00:47:45,"- Like, you can buy it."
00:47:45,00:47:46,- Is it like inflatable crowds for movies?
00:47:46,00:47:47,- No.
00:47:47,00:47:48,- Yeah.
00:47:48,00:47:50,"- I think Seabiscuit famously, like, that's where it started."
00:47:50,00:47:51,- I think that was the first one.
00:47:51,00:47:52,"Yeah, this guy called Joe Biggins,"
00:47:52,00:47:54,who suddenly realized rather than organize loads
00:47:54,00:47:56,"of extras and have to pay them,"
00:47:56,00:47:58,you can just make inflatable people.
00:47:58,00:47:59,- Really?
00:47:59,00:48:00,"- And you can do,"
00:48:00,00:48:02,"I think he got 10,000 in the back of a lorry,"
00:48:02,00:48:03,which you can't do with extras.
00:48:03,00:48:05,(laughing)
00:48:05,00:48:08,"- That's against union rules, yeah, yeah."
00:48:08,00:48:09,"- Oh, they're very annoying about that."
00:48:09,00:48:12,"- I really hope, like, in the background of, like,"
00:48:12,00:48:14,"a movie, like, Gladiator, if you look carefully,"
00:48:14,00:48:17,"there's just a slowly floppy, deflating."
00:48:17,00:48:18,"- They're floating away, unfortunately."
00:48:18,00:48:19,- He is helium.
00:48:19,00:48:21,(laughing)
00:48:21,00:48:23,"- Weirdly, appendages cost extra,"
00:48:23,00:48:26,so he charges $50 for the Bod the torso.
00:48:26,00:48:28,- So is this from a big distance that you're shooting?
00:48:28,00:48:29,"Of course, 'cause it couldn't be--"
00:48:29,00:48:30,"- Yeah, it is."
00:48:30,00:48:32,"It's like crowd scenes, really."
00:48:32,00:48:35,"So Seabiscuit, they're running around a horse track,"
00:48:35,00:48:36,and they-- - So that's kind of perfect.
00:48:36,00:48:38,"- And what you do is you get loads of them,"
00:48:38,00:48:40,"and then you get some humans in between them,"
00:48:40,00:48:43,"and your eyes are naturally drawn to the humans,"
00:48:43,00:48:45,so the rest of it is just background.
00:48:45,00:48:45,- That's brilliant.
00:48:45,00:48:47,- It's amazing what we don't notice.
00:48:47,00:48:48,- I read about a movie that was made
00:48:48,00:48:51,"by actually an old buddy of mine called Anthony Ng,"
00:48:51,00:48:54,where he tracked down the lady who has the Guinness World
00:48:54,00:48:58,record for the most extras appearances in movies.
00:48:58,00:49:02,"So her record was 1,951."
00:49:02,00:49:02,"And they're everything from,"
00:49:02,00:49:06,she said she was on 80% of the carry-on films.
00:49:06,00:49:09,She was in the very first episode of EastEnders.
00:49:09,00:49:12,"She remembers being on a set one day with a guy,"
00:49:12,00:49:14,"having a great chat at the lunch hall,"
00:49:14,00:49:16,and then he's the lead in a movie years later.
00:49:16,00:49:17,"It's David Bowie, who says,"
00:49:17,00:49:19,"""Hey, we had a great chat,"""
00:49:19,00:49:20,and they reconnected through that.
00:49:20,00:49:22,So she sees people go up.
00:49:22,00:49:24,"So her name's Jill Goldston,"
00:49:24,00:49:29,"and we know that she has appeared in the 1,951 movies."
00:49:29,00:49:31,"Certainly, she had at that point for the record,"
00:49:31,00:49:33,"because her husband is an accountant,"
00:49:33,00:49:35,and he marked down every time.
00:49:35,00:49:36,He just got obsessed with making sure
00:49:36,00:49:37,that he had lists of what was going on.
00:49:37,00:49:39,"Yeah, so there's a whole documentary about her,"
00:49:39,00:49:42,and all her little things that she learned along the way.
00:49:42,00:49:44,"Don't look at Tom Cruise when he's on set, you know?"
00:49:44,00:49:45,"- Are we saying because her husband's an accountant,"
00:49:45,00:49:47,therefore sort of a really boring guy
00:49:47,00:49:49,who loves tallying up on hate information?
00:49:49,00:49:50,- He just happened to do it.
00:49:50,00:49:52,"Yeah, he liked making Excel spreadsheets."
00:49:52,00:49:53,- Fair. - For respect.
00:49:53,00:49:54,- Yeah.
00:49:54,00:49:56,- Don't point at me when he's talking about a boring guy.
00:49:56,00:49:57,It's offensive.
00:49:59,00:50:01,- When we say someone comes from central casting.
00:50:01,00:50:02,"- Oh, yeah."
00:50:02,00:50:03,"- That's a phrase, right?"
00:50:03,00:50:05,"It's a sort of, oh, he's straight out of central casting."
00:50:05,00:50:06,"I mean, someone's a bit of like a stock carrier,"
00:50:06,00:50:08,or like if someone turns up and they're an accountant
00:50:08,00:50:09,and they're wearing a gray suit
00:50:09,00:50:11,and they're carrying a gray briefcase
00:50:11,00:50:13,and they've got to roll up a breller.
00:50:13,00:50:14,"Central casting is an actual company,"
00:50:14,00:50:17,"which I didn't know until I was researching this,"
00:50:17,00:50:19,"and it's 100 years old this year,"
00:50:19,00:50:24,"'cause it started in 100 years ago, 1925."
00:50:24,00:50:26,- You could do the math as well.
00:50:26,00:50:29,"- Wow, are you an accountant?"
00:50:29,00:50:32,"- Yeah, and just, that was the firm that Jennifer Bender"
00:50:32,00:50:33,was the vice president of.
00:50:33,00:50:35,"They place hundreds of, even now, these days,"
00:50:35,00:50:37,they place hundreds of thousands of people a year.
00:50:37,00:50:39,- American based or here?
00:50:39,00:50:41,"- Certainly in America, and I think all over,"
00:50:41,00:50:42,and lots of people started out there.
00:50:42,00:50:45,"David Niven started out there, he's a famous actor."
00:50:45,00:50:48,"He was registered as Anglo-Saxon type number 2008,"
00:50:48,00:50:51,"and in the 1920s, extras were categorized into groups"
00:50:51,00:50:53,because you just needed like a job lot of people
00:50:53,00:50:55,"who looked a particular way,"
00:50:55,00:50:57,"and the groups included blonde, beautiful,"
00:50:57,00:51:00,"Latin, nurses, swimmers, and toothless."
00:51:00,00:51:03,(all laughing)
00:51:03,00:51:06,"- Sometimes you could take a few boxes,"
00:51:06,00:51:07,didn't you?
00:51:07,00:51:07,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:51:07,00:51:10,"- Beautiful, but toothless, you know, I'm not too gigs."
00:51:10,00:51:13,"- The Log of the Rings films have got a lot of extras in,"
00:51:13,00:51:14,"haven't they, famously?"
00:51:14,00:51:17,"In fact, they pretty much cast everyone in New Zealand,"
00:51:17,00:51:18,"in those movies, I think."
00:51:18,00:51:19,"In Return of the King,"
00:51:19,00:51:23,"they brought in some members of the New Zealand army,"
00:51:23,00:51:25,and apparently they were way too enthusiastic
00:51:25,00:51:27,and kept breaking all the wooden swords and stuff.
00:51:27,00:51:28,(all laughing)
00:51:28,00:51:31,"But in the two towers, they had a group of,"
00:51:31,00:51:33,"apologies to people who like Log of the Rings,"
00:51:33,00:51:34,"'cause I've never read any of them,"
00:51:34,00:51:37,"but there's a group called the Uruk High,"
00:51:37,00:51:38,which is the orcs.
00:51:38,00:51:39,- Floorless.
00:51:39,00:51:42,"- And they needed to get people to play them,"
00:51:42,00:51:44,so they put a casting call out for everyone
00:51:44,00:51:47,over six foot tall in New Zealand
00:51:47,00:51:49,"to come and play the Uruk High,"
00:51:49,00:51:50,"and they couldn't find enough people,"
00:51:50,00:51:53,"so they said, okay, everyone who's over five foot"
00:51:53,00:51:55,"can come in, and they brought in all these"
00:51:55,00:51:56,"like slightly shorter men,"
00:51:56,00:51:59,and they were no one on set as the Uruk Low.
00:51:59,00:52:00,- Brilliant.
00:52:00,00:52:03,(all laughing)
00:52:03,00:52:05,- Having a fun day out as an extra on a movie.
00:52:05,00:52:06,(all laughing)
00:52:06,00:52:08,Can we get the Uruk Low in?
00:52:08,00:52:09,- We would.
00:52:09,00:52:12,- Do you know how many extras were used on those movies?
00:52:12,00:52:14,"It'd be in like the tens of thousands, right?"
00:52:14,00:52:15,- Tens of thousands for sure.
00:52:15,00:52:19,"- Yeah, so the one that gets cited as the movie"
00:52:19,00:52:21,that possibly will never get broken for most extras
00:52:21,00:52:26,"is Gandhi, which had 300,000 extras,"
00:52:26,00:52:27,"which is pretty extraordinary,"
00:52:27,00:52:30,and that was for Gandhi's funeral scene.
00:52:30,00:52:32,"- They weren't all paid, though."
00:52:32,00:52:32,- No.
00:52:32,00:52:34,"- Most extras, like 200,000 of them"
00:52:34,00:52:36,were just people who were milling around.
00:52:36,00:52:37,(all laughing)
00:52:37,00:52:38,"- Yeah, that's true."
00:52:38,00:52:40,"And that's often sometimes the case,"
00:52:40,00:52:42,it's just actual people in the background.
00:52:42,00:52:45,"There is a big list of movies of the most extras ever used,"
00:52:45,00:52:46,"Lord of the Rings is in there as well,"
00:52:46,00:52:49,"and another one is The Last Emperor movie,"
00:52:49,00:52:50,which was filmed--
00:52:50,00:52:51,"- Oh, about Puyi."
00:52:51,00:52:54,"- Based on Puyi, it was filmed in the Forbidden City."
00:52:54,00:52:57,It was an extraordinary achievement of British filmmaking
00:52:57,00:52:58,because they managed to get access
00:52:58,00:53:01,to the Forbidden City itself to film inside.
00:53:01,00:53:02,"So even when the queen was over there,"
00:53:02,00:53:05,she couldn't visit it because they had priority access
00:53:05,00:53:07,over filming in there.
00:53:07,00:53:09,"It was a big deal, it was a big collaboration."
00:53:09,00:53:10,"- Well, she could have, if she applied to be an extra."
00:53:10,00:53:11,- Yeah.
00:53:11,00:53:12,(all laughing)
00:53:12,00:53:14,- Is it a comedy?
00:53:14,00:53:16,"- Yes, it's hilarious."
00:53:16,00:53:17,- It's a raucous unit-based comedy.
00:53:17,00:53:20,Have you guys heard of Waller groups?
00:53:20,00:53:21,- Waller.
00:53:21,00:53:23,"- Waller, W-A-W-L-L-A."
00:53:23,00:53:24,- Waller.
00:53:24,00:53:25,- Yeah.
00:53:25,00:53:26,- No.
00:53:26,00:53:29,- Rick Waller was a singer from the early days of pop idol.
00:53:29,00:53:32,"- Fats Waller was a blues, blues, you know?"
00:53:32,00:53:34,"I mean, we're talking extras in movies here."
00:53:34,00:53:37,"Phoebe Waller Bridge, there's a bit of lots of movies."
00:53:37,00:53:39,"- Oh, the prequel to Wall-E."
00:53:39,00:53:40,- Wall-A.
00:53:40,00:53:40,- Wall-A.
00:53:40,00:53:41,"- Yeah, yes."
00:53:41,00:53:43,- I'm in the film area at least.
00:53:43,00:53:44,"- You are, that's very good."
00:53:44,00:53:47,"- No, this is to do with the fact that"
00:53:47,00:53:49,"if you were filming extras in the background,"
00:53:49,00:53:52,you're miking up your main characters who you're recording.
00:53:52,00:53:54,"You haven't necessarily miked up the extras,"
00:53:54,00:53:56,but you need that background noise.
00:53:56,00:53:58,So they often hire people to come in
00:53:58,00:54:00,and make the sounds of the extras.
00:54:00,00:54:04,So they're sort of actors who are acting as the extras.
00:54:04,00:54:05,- Oh my God.
00:54:05,00:54:06,- And so they stand in and there'll be a group of them
00:54:06,00:54:07,who will stand in a studio
00:54:07,00:54:10,and they just have to make murmur sounds.
00:54:10,00:54:12,"They're called Wallers because Wall-A, Wall-A, Wall-A, Wall-A."
00:54:12,00:54:13,"- Like group-up, group-up, group-up."
00:54:13,00:54:14,"- Exactly, yeah."
00:54:14,00:54:17,"And so they're called Waller, but it's obviously changed."
00:54:17,00:54:19,But so that often happens where you just have a group of people
00:54:19,00:54:21,having to make the sounds of the people in the background.
00:54:21,00:54:23,- Who mentioned short extras?
00:54:23,00:54:25,"Oh, the Uruk Hai, being the Merrick Lowe."
00:54:25,00:54:28,So there's another film which had short extras
00:54:28,00:54:29,for a very specific reason.
00:54:29,00:54:30,So can you guess?
00:54:30,00:54:32,It's one of the most famous films of all time.
00:54:32,00:54:32,- Chocolate Factory.
00:54:32,00:54:34,"- Yeah, that was my first thought."
00:54:34,00:54:35,"- Not Chocolate Factory, not Wizard of Oz."
00:54:35,00:54:37,"Those probably both did do exactly that,"
00:54:37,00:54:38,but please let's just move on.
00:54:38,00:54:39,- Yep.
00:54:39,00:54:42,"- Okay, it's something with lots of children in it."
00:54:42,00:54:43,- It's not.
00:54:43,00:54:45,It's something where you need to make something else
00:54:45,00:54:46,look a different size.
00:54:46,00:54:48,"- Oh, okay, a film about a giant."
00:54:48,00:54:49,- Dullover's Travels.
00:54:49,00:54:50,- Very good.
00:54:50,00:54:51,- Very nice.
00:54:51,00:54:53,- No one's so short they can be a little appugian.
00:54:53,00:54:55,(all laughing)
00:54:55,00:54:58,- We've been in a bunch of three entire people.
00:54:58,00:54:59,"- Honey, I shrunk the kids."
00:54:59,00:55:02,- I think we've still got the same problem here.
00:55:02,00:55:07,"- You've built a prop, but you need the prop to,"
00:55:07,00:55:08,but the prop is only like three quarters
00:55:08,00:55:10,of the actual size of the actual thing it's representing.
00:55:10,00:55:12,So you need to make it look bigger.
00:55:12,00:55:14,"- That, what's the one where the monkey's coming?"
00:55:14,00:55:17,It's Earth all along and they planted the apes.
00:55:17,00:55:19,"So there's the Statue of Liberty,"
00:55:19,00:55:21,but they couldn't get a full size one.
00:55:21,00:55:22,So they had to get small apes.
00:55:22,00:55:23,- That's right.
00:55:23,00:55:25,"This is not, I mean, it's not right, but it's brilliant."
00:55:25,00:55:26,"- Oh, damn it."
00:55:26,00:55:28,- But it's right in that it's good.
00:55:28,00:55:29,"Yeah, it's exactly that kind of thing."
00:55:29,00:55:32,- But it's something else like Stonehenge or the Eiffel.
00:55:32,00:55:33,- Titanic.
00:55:33,00:55:34,Leonardo DiCaprio is actually four foot two.
00:55:34,00:55:35,- Titanic.
00:55:35,00:55:36,- Titanic.
00:55:36,00:55:37,- That was a Titanic.
00:55:37,00:55:39,- James Cameron only used people under five foot eight
00:55:39,00:55:41,on the actual ship.
00:55:41,00:55:42,- Okay.
00:55:42,00:55:44,"- To make it look, to make the ship look bigger."
00:55:44,00:55:44,- Wow.
00:55:44,00:55:45,- 'Cause it's a pretty big ship already.
00:55:45,00:55:48,"- It is pretty big, but the ship was a bit smaller"
00:55:48,00:55:49,than the real life Titanic.
00:55:49,00:55:50,It was 15% smaller.
00:55:50,00:55:53,"So if you cast a load of like six foot nine people,"
00:55:53,00:55:54,it was like a bit. - It's gonna look tiny.
00:55:54,00:55:55,You're right.
00:55:55,00:55:58,(all laughing)
00:55:58,00:55:59,- Why have they started the movie in the lifeboat?
00:55:59,00:56:00,What's going on?
00:56:00,00:56:03,(all laughing)
00:56:03,00:56:05,(upbeat music)
00:56:05,00:56:09,"- Okay, that's it."
